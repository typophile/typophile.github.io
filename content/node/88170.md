    that's absolutely correct,\r\nbut -at least in the font versions I'm looking at-\r\nthere
    are still some small differences,\r\nlike the at symbol (@), the thickness of
    the upper part of /t\r\nand the thickness of some other serifs (e.g. /s)\r\nand
    these differences are all present in this (bold) version\r\nof Hernando's image.\r\n"

  body: "I know Ricardo, \r\nI never conceived your comment as nitpicking :)\r\n\r\nOn
    the contrary, I have to thank you because I learned 2 things from this topic:\r\na)
    You make me look closer at the fine differences of Times New Roman & Dutch 801\r\nb)
    You make me look at the dictionary, what \"nitpicking\" means - nice word!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nFivos"
