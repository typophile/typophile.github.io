  found a small typographical detail. A functional \"orphan\" word, reoccurring on
  every page thru out the publication.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know more about this little
  detail, would be interesting to find out more.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nAndrejs"

  body: It's called a catchword and it's the first word on the next page, often styled
    to match. It was supposed to make the act of turning the page less disruptive
    to the reading experience.

  body: "Hi\r\n\r\nYes, that I figured out. However what I find interesting is that
    it has, historically, two meanings. The first seems to be a aid for the typesetter,
    writer, to match pages in the bookmaking progress. However this is secondary with
    additional pagina. The other is for us readers (saying it would make it simpler
    to read) . The only criticism I have found is a graphic handbook authored by De
    Vinne, ca 1900, shortly stating \"it wont be missed\". (saying it was out of use)\r\n\r\nLinda
    Downing states in a study; \"Both antiquated and obtrusive, the catch-phrase interrupts
    the cognitive process of reading: \u201Cmaking-transparent ... the physical sign
    which constitutes the act of reading; and in doing this, catch-words participate
    in the \u2018pictorialization\u2019 of typography\", \r\n\r\nSo is it a aid or
    not? :)"
