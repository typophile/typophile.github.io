body: "As someone with minimal familiarity with Czech/Slovak, I had two questions
  regarding the form of the h\u01CEcek.\r\n\r\nFirst, I was wondering whether it would
  be terribly unnatural to use the \u2018standard\u2019 form of the ha\u010Dek on
  a lowercase \u2018t\u2019 if the form of that letter has no ascender.\r\n\r\nSecond,
  I was wondering how closely the design of the ha\u010Dek must follow the design
  of the apostrophe for lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nWould the diacritics in the following
  example be entirely unnatural, or would they be acceptable for a display face?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MiasmaCaronQ_4342.gif]"

    side centered with the right side of the stem [?]). The reasons of your choice
    are clear and the idea is good, but this way the letter looks a bit too similar
    to \u010D (c caron).\r\nPost another bitmap to compare, and let's wait what Czechs
    say."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback -- I'd made the ha\u010Dek on the<em> d </em> deliberately
    thin to minimize the amount of kerning required for following accented vowels,
    but I agree that it doesn't really look right. Here's a new version. I've also
    included <em> \u010D </em> in the example so it can be compared with <em> \u0165
    </em>, as well as the acute which occurs on vowels which aren't <em> i </em> so
    it can be compared with the ha\u010Dek.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MiasmaCaron2_5834.gif]"

  body: I prefer the original tcaron, after all it's a idiosyncratic display font,
    and the cap Tcaron form is the same. The typeface has very strong uniform spacing,
    the dcaron looks too tight to me.

  body: Your original design looks more interesting. Why not include it as an alternate?
    (I assume that most Czech designers would spot the alternate when they check to
    see if the font suits their language needs).

    style. Sure it\u2019s incorrect, but given how far that t strays from the norm,
    there will probably be users who find it acceptable."

  body: James is right. If there is no ascender on "t", there is no reason to use
    the "apostrophe" form of the caron. And, I am a Czech speaker, BTW.

  body: "I know nothing about Czech typography, so please ignore the following if
    you are only looking for advice on ha\u010Dek design.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the
    font looks slightly messy with acute accents (including the similarly-looking
    apostrophe on the d) at three different angles, in addition to vertical apostrophes.
    The shape used on wide vowels looks rather flat to me, but of course a flatter
    shape may be appropriate for languages other than French. A more upright shape
    (like the one used on the i) could work on both narrow and wide letters.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do the double acute accent (if included) and comma look like?\r\n\r\nThe attached
    picture illustrates (badly) another possible solution to the d-apostrophe problem.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/d'_3551.png]"

  body: "I was soliciting advice on the ha\u010Dek, but I'd be rather foolish not
    to accept other suggestions as well.\r\n\r\nI hadn't really thought about the
    clashing accents on the two different acutes, but now that you point it out it
    is really glaring -- I need a narrower form of the accents on the i, but I'll
    need to keep the overall angles consistent.\r\n\r\nYour alternate suggestion for
    the \u010F is one that I wished I'd thought of -- not only does it achieve my
    goal of trying to reduce the amount of kerning required since I'm trying to keep
    the negative space as consistent as possible, but it also works well for this
    design since one of the stylistic alternates I've been working on involves some
    character interleaving. I've shown this below (n.b. this is still a work in progress),
    along with the complete set of accents (including double acute) and the comma
    as you requested. As I upload this I notice that the positioning of the doubleacute
    probably needs fixing.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AGIMiasmaDiacritic_6037.gif]"

  body: "Thanks for uploading another sample. I really like the interwoven letters.\r\n\r\nI
    asked about the double acute since it is typically made up of two normal acute
    accents, which could not possibly work with your wide acute. It seems to be made
    up of two narrow acutes instead. My solution would probably be to use a shape
    similar to your current narrow acute on both wide and narrow letters, double it
    to make a double acute, and use the same/opposite angle for the grave, circumflex
    and ha\u010Dek, and make the tilde and breve taller as well to match the other
    diacritics. You are clearly much more creative than I am, so I am sure you will
    be able to come up with a less conventional solution if you want to use different
    accent shapes/widths on different letters.\r\n\r\nThe comma has the same shape
    as the apostrophe, as one would expect. In my eyes, this shape looks a bit too
    square, spiky and \u2018unfriendly\u2019 compared to the generous curves elsewhere.
    Perhaps something more like your d' apostrophe might work just as well for commas,
    apostrophes, double quotes etc.?\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to seeing the final
    result."

    looks like the standard tcaron with amputated top, i.e. there is one deviation
    from normal for the reader to contend with.\r\nIn your radical version with the
    v-shaped ha\u010Dek, there are two deviations from expectation that require decoding,
    which is too much, although, as Matej says, it is nonetheless logical. \r\nThe
    radical version is too thought-provoking.\r\nMore importantly, it is not true
    to the \"stencil\" premise of the type design, which is omission, not replacement."
