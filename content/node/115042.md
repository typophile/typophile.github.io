  body: "As for _Lumber_ I agree with Ryuk that it's probably hand drawn.\r\nI don't
    know if the designers of this logo were ever exposed to the drawing books of Andrew
    Loomis, but check out the almost identical treatment of the letters in the script
    lettered on the cover of his Successful Drawing:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LoomisSuccessfulDrawing_4956.jpg]\r\nDon"
