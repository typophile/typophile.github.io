  body: "The \"AutoDTL\" part is certainly an improvement. But frankly the super loose
    \"Car Care\" is pretty bad... Just switching it to all-caps would help. But what
    about nestling it into the opening between \"A\" and \"DTL\" at the top?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yes, \"Car Care\" is way too small and spaced out. All caps would help, and
    make it larger, but you may need to make the thick bar shorter, or center the
    words and put a line (or some other symbol) on either side of it within the bar
    to fill the space. \r\n\r\nAnd if the bar is in color, I would make the top part
    in color too. (Of course you'll also need a black-and-white version to use on
    photocopied documents, etc.)"

  body: "At small sizes, the \"Car Care\" will simply disappear\u2026 In fact, it's
    so marginalized in this design, you have to ask if it's really necessary. \"AutoDTL\"
    would be a stronger mark standing on its own, and the brand name already signals
    the industry.\r\n\r\nI would also design the wordmark in 1 color first, and then
    supply different fills as potential looks. If it doesn't stand up as an outline,
    it simply won't last more than a few years. Look at how many fills Apple has applied
    to their mark. It's been everything from a shiny piece of candy to brushed aluminum,
    from rainbow to pure white. An outline allows you to have diversity and flexibility
    while building brand equity."

  body: "Thanks for the input, really apreciated.\r\n\r\nYes the \"Car Care\" string
    was a bit out of touch...\r\nYes i experimented with caps and it was better, i
    experimented also between the A and D but it was a bit clumsyish...\r\nAnd yes
    it was redundant as even with my native language DTL can be interpreted as detail....\r\nSo
    \" Car Care\" off.\r\nNow im having some doubts about the A, im considering turning
    it to a lower a as with this font it has a nice shape. What do You think ?\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AutoDTL-Logo5_4694.png]"

  body: 'It was a good idea to eliminate "car care".  Regarding the "a", I agree that
    the lower-case looks nice but I''d probably capitalize it the same way you do
    when writing it. Also the spacing between the letters needs some tweaking. For
    example compare the big space to the right of the cap A to the tight space between
    u and t. '
