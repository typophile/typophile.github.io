  didn't tell the author the typeface before leaving the country -- now they have
  to change some pages. The image is a bit pixilated, because I tried enlarging it.
  It's like the sort of font I'd have in Part 14 of the Script Guide, but I don't
  think it's there.\r\n\r\nAnyone recognize this?  Thanks\r\n- Mike"

  body: Mike - cross over to the dark side. I just got an iMac refurb for a song (2
    gig RAM, 20" screen, small footprint, $1299) & finally made the switch to OS X.
    No regrets. It sings.

  body: "Patty, I wish I could. I wanted to upgrade the OS, but the new one only comes
    on DVD, and I don't have an input device for that. Aargh! I do have OS X, but
    I thought I should jump to the latest. So I'm stuck back where I started. I don't
    want to go through conversion just for  OS X 1.\r\n\r\nDavid, \r\n\r\nI see other
    images, just not the one Tiff posted earlier.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you can see two samples
    of this font at http://bowfinprintworks.com/Hand_DrawnSample.html. Look familiar?\r\n\r\n-

    I've got the font. Never used it. It stinks."
