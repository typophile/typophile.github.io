  body: 'Hmm ... two things about that script font: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Stanley appears
    to be another digitization of a typeface which <BR>appears in the Solotype Catalog
    as Apache. URW digitized it <BR>under that name, <a href="URL" target="_blank">
    Apache</a>. <BR> <BR>2&#41; The typeface actually used appears to be one that
    appears in <BR>the Solotype catalog as August. It&#39;s stretched horizontally
    a bit <BR>compared to Apache, like so &#40;using the only two digital versions
    <BR>I&#39;m aware of&#41;: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67723.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Cochise is <a href="http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm" target="_blank">
    Brendel Informatik&#39;s</a> old digitization of August, while <BR><a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/toledo.htm"
    target="_blank"> Toledo</a> is Fontbank&#39;s. Toledo matches the sample image
    better, <BR>is better made and has a more complete character set, but, <BR>unfortunately,
    neither includes proper quotation marks. <BR> <BR>Rats. I see that I managed to
    misspell Cochise in my image. <BR><br>'

  body: What are the differences between Apache and August other than being slightly
    horizontally stretched? Are there significant differences in the letterforms?

  body: James, you have just described the difference, but they are two different
    faces. August is slightly heavier to my eye too. These are both designs from the
    era of film type, and I think it was common to distort a basic lettering sample,
    or re-do it with the same lettering artist making a slightly heavier version.
    They also mixed and matched aspects of typefaces, or added serifs to sans lettering.
    They also used optical means to produce various slants to vertical designs, and
    gave each one a new name. If you look through a Photo-Lettering book or the Solotype
    Catalog you see this over and over. <BR> <BR>This same basic lettering has produced
    families of typefaces, and as you can tell from Mike F&#39;s information, a variety
    of foundries have their own digital versions of a lot of this hand lettering.
    Sixpack is a Panache version based on the same lettering, and there are more.
    <BR> <BR>April, Arctic and Arbor are 3 sans versions of this same lettering family.
    You see them everywhere.

  body: A good starting point for &#34;CHICO&#39;S BAIL BONDS&#34; would be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/century-gothic/bold/testdrive.html?s=CHICO%27S+BAIL+BONDS&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Century Gothic</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-avant-garde-gothic/medium/testdrive.html?s=CHICO%27S+BAIL+BONDS&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Avant Garde</a>. The letterforms seem to match Century Gothic
    better, but the weight looks closer to Avant Garde. In any case, that A has to
    be condensed. <BR> <BR> - Lex
