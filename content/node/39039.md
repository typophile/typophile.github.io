  the comic that changed my whole life as a kid and gave me the desire to be a cartoonist
  myself. This is a fitting tribute to one of the great comic strip artists of our
  time ....\r\n\r\n\"Canadian cartoonist [[http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/artStudio.php?artist=a3dff7dd55a576|Seth]]
  (Gregory Gallant) has quietly joined the ranks of \xFCber book designers such as
  Chip Kidd, having recently designed raconteur Stuart McLean's Vinyl Caf\xE9 Diaries
  and the much-anticipated, definitive, 25-volume reissue of The Complete Peanuts.
  Seth spent a decade editing, designing and illustrating this petite book, and his
  postmodern retro aesthetic is evident everywhere, from the tall, stylized deco script
  on the bottle-green stamped cloth cover to his trademark font, hand-lettered chapter
  titles, illustrations and drawings throughout. As a result, Bannock resembles a
  vintage elementary-school primer.\""

  body: I often think that my affection for type comes from countless hours spent
    reading <em>Peanuts</em> and <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>. Sure neither one was
    especially good with letters, but what they did with a little black and and a
    lot of negative space never stops amazing me.

  body: I know. This is what drew me (pun not intended, lol) to this type of art style;
    the ability to express whole volumes in a few black lines. My own strips have
    never met with the kind of success as Schultz, but I will always enjoy doing them
    because they are fueled by my love of the craft (as well as those who craft them).

    think it had a pretty big influence on me. I would draw my favorite characters
    from the strip, and was fascinated with Snoopy's novel-in-progress, which always
    began, \"It was a dark and stormy night.\"  :-)\r\n\r\nWith this collection, Seth
    and Fantagraphics have done Schulz proud."

    can see that and die happy.

  body: "So do I. Any cartoonist worth his mettle does his own lettering by hand.
    The lettering is a talent as much as the drawing is. I remember my first job as
    an entry level drafter fixing all the company's technical illustrations and doing
    all the lettering by hand. It came naturally to me, just like lettering my own
    comics does. It's an inborn ability just like the drawing. Also cartoon style
    fonts are as much an art form as any other font (and I'm not speaking of Comic
    Sans MS). My favorite sites for finding cartoon fonts are [[http://www.blambot.com/fonts.shtml|Blambot]]
    and [[http://www.comicbookfonts.com/home.html?sid=0001zm1QUkEia2ErQk4p0q8|Comic
    Book Fonts]].\r\n\r\nI love being a cartoonist and I love being a part of that
    field because no matter how bad a day I'm having cartoons can always make me smile
    :)"

    Charles Schulz drew and lettered everything himself... He famously never had,
    or wanted, an assistant. \"Peanuts\" was a completely personal creation."

  body: Little Chicago was my first strip I ever created. Originally I had created
    a character called [[http://dougcloud.net/show/hopps.gif|Hopps]] - a bullfrog
    - and the rest of the characters I just developed over time. These are a group
    of critters who all live in a large park in the middle of the Windy City. I used
    to draw out these strips in pencil and then ink them with a black Flair pen. You
    may view one of these old strips [[http://dougcloud.net/show/littlechicago.jpg|here]].
    This was the first of my cartoon strips I scanned into Photoshop and colored.
    D. C. Wayne is my pen name; a take on my actual name just with the letters switched
    around. I always liked names with initials (J. R. R. Tolkien, for example).
