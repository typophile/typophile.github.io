  the Films of Ken Russell. The publisher wants \"gothic, gory, perverse, over the
  top.\" If you're not familiar with Ken Russell, you can check him out at imdb. He's,
  shall we say, \"irreverent.\" I'd like to give it that b-movie feel, without it
  looking too much like a horror flick font (no dripping blood, etc.). Or maybe a
  kind of Goth Punk type . . . Any ideas?\r\nThanks,\r\nSarah"

  body: "\"Goth Punk\" is a neat idea. That would entail taking a gothic typeface
    (not sans!) and giving it a punk setting -- mixing style, and perhaps size and
    baseline shift. Here's how it could look in FF Merlin, which has a variety of
    styles.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/goth_4917.png]\r\n\r\nOr you could
    mix blackletter \"Gothic\" with sans serif \"Gothic\" in the same word. And then
    add distress... "

  body: "I think getting the pub his \"gorey, perverse\" without looking like a horror
    flick face will be tricky. What about something snappy and clean from one face,
    with \"eerie\" rounded distressed for the rest? A Jeckyll & Hyde sorta thing:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/horrortext_5650.jpg]\r\ntop:
    Chiller and !the troubles, bottom Perpetua and !MISQOT\r\n(warning: two of those
    are mine, but that's my bag.)\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nConsider, as well, the pulpy
    posters of 50's \"My zombie stepmother was a giant teen-aged were-space alien
    squid\"-type films. Brushed strokes, black weights, tilted baselines. And non-dripping
    heavy vertical perspectives. Or anything shattered, though thats more just dated
    than camp.\r\n\r\nOr look at anything here (pay and free):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.astigmatic.com/index.html\r\n\r\n---\r\nNick:
    What I wouldn't give to do the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeco/gothic-gothic/\">macabre
    restyling of this</a> as a luridly distressed face. Gothic Gothic Gothic."

  body: "Right, TypeCo's Gothic Gothic is way cool, especially the horizontal extension.\r\nBut
    I believe there is a history of \"modernized\" or reductive blackletter faces
    (the genre is pretty geometric from the outset with Gutenburg, anyway) such as
    Morris Benton's Art Deco <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/american-text\">American
    Text</a> of the 1930s.\r\n\r\n"

    gothic so much as ... warped?"
