  similar ones, but I've had no luck finding what this is precisely. It is the font
  used on the old PDPs from the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI
  attached a sample of the font, which came from [[http://i.imgur.com/Huu1S.jpg|this

  at a lower resolution.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nquad"

  body: There are some very amateurish elements to the execution of that (lack of
    optical compensation where curved strokes meet straights, for one). That leads
    me to think that it was not from a major vendor... could be hard to track down.
