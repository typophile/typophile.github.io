body: How do you properly pronounce Futura? Is it like saying future with an a, like
  "FEW-tra"? Or is it like "foo-TUR-a"?

    of the Designer's prefered language (I think that's what's going on with <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28051?\">all
    these</a>.) Renner was German, so by those rules it's probably more like your
    second interpretation. Beware that some people might think you a pedant for speaking
    like this. FYOO-tyur-uh or fyoo-TYUR-uh are perhaps more 'Merkan alternatives.\r\n\r\nAlso,

    it - in the good German style.

  body: "My take: To pronounce it correctly in German you not only have to do as Thomas
    indicates, but also do a guttural or rolled 'r'. Doing the full German pronunciation
    when speaking English I think will sound forced, unless you are from a German
    speaking country. \r\n\r\nSo I think pronouncing it either a more English way,
    as evilfansanfan has it, or halfway German with both 'u's having an 'oo' sound,
    is fine."

  body: "The exact pronunciation in unequivocal IPA symbols is show here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/futura.gif\r\n\r\nThe
    font name \"Futura\" is not of German origin, but is derived from the female-gender
    form \"futura\" of the Latin adjective \"futurus, futura, futurum\". This is because
    all Latin font names have female gender, i.e. \"futura\" is short for Latin \"littera
    futura\" or \"litera futura\" denoting \"the future letter, the coming type(face)\".\r\n"
