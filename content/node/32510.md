  body: 'Any of them might beworth working on but it''s hard to say with such a small
    image. Also what i notice most is that there are many fonts now that look similar.
    if you are picking one why not ask yourself - ''which of these is taking things
    further?'' These remind me of Lineto fonts. '

  body: Looking at the larger image I would say that the 4th one looks the most promsing.
    Going back further, do you know about Bauhaus design & dutch fuctionalism?

  body: "Hi Eben\r\n\r\nI read about Bauhaus design, I even sit sometimes on a chair
    which was designed by Corbusier. It's about Light, Air & Space, or the function
    does the design! \r\n\r\nI will try to find some references and continue to work
    on the typeface with the style in mind. Thanx!   "

  body: "In some ways your design is more whimsical than the Bauhaus stuff more like
    the Dutch. But in any event I suppose what I wanted to say was that when you are
    working in an area with alot of historical work that already exists it's a good
    idea to make clear for yourself & others what your intent is. Is it a revival
    or a reinterpretation or an original work - or something else. This might sound
    fussy but I think that when you are working in an area as heavily explored as
    this, it is worthwhile to check out all the presedents as well as you can and
    to make clear what your intent is in relationship to the work that is already
    done. One advantage of doing this is that the quality of your work is likely to
    benefit, and your sales will be better too as the work is better and you can better
    position your product - people like to buy fonts presented in a clear context.\r\n\r\nYou
    migt want to read this essay too:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=2\r\n\r\nWhile
    you might not wholy agree with it I think it does a good job of making clear distinctions
    between things that seem to be the same at first glance.\r\n\r\nLet me know if
    this makes sense or if you dissaree & if so why. \r\n\r\nCheers!  "

    body: "I agree with you, I shouldn't have post my design in such a lazy way. Let
      me put it this way. It is my first time I've post a design here and I think
      I learned a lot for the next time. \r\n\r\nAbout the design:\r\nBecause I'm
      new to typedesign, I wanted to do a stencil typeface with simple forms. In the
      meantime I practice calligraphy. The design is not based on any typeface, and
      that's the first mistake I made. Once it is done it's hard to push it further.
      I see, it's important to work carefuly and keep a direction (style, use, size,
      target etc.) in mind. \r\n\r\nMy final decision:\r\nI won't continue with this
      typeface (for now), but I will continue to design type the proper way! I'll
      let you know when I post a new typeface and I guess there would be more details
      about the work.\r\n\r\nCheers!   "

  body: I want to make clear that I don't think you did anything 'wrong' in posting
    your design. But I am pleased to be able to help to some degree. And I congradulate
    you on refining your process. I am looking foreward to seeing & reading your posts
    in the future.
