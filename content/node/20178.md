  body: "Wnf,\r\n\r\nI assume that the people who run this site are developing their
    own software and are going through growing pains. \r\n\r\nIf not, Lord knows what
    they are using. \r\n\r\nThere are software programmes out there that work, on
    the face of it, much better, and do the basic function to which you refer. For
    example, Simple Machines, which is not only good, but free.\r\n\r\nWhatever is
    being used, it would be nice to be able to do a search, and click on the each
    resulting URL in succession, rather than, after clicking on one of the URLs in
    the search result, which on my PC, tied to a major network, results in having
    to do the search all over again inorder to click on another search result. \r\n\r\nThat
    is just plain rinkydink, not to mention infuriating.\r\n\r\nThe discussion forum
    programme on this site is the worst that I have encountered for ordinary forum
    purposes. I assume that it must have functions in relation to graphics that justify
    the (hopefully temporary) major shortcomings. \r\n\r\nIn other words, the ability
    to get an e-mail alert about threads in which one is interested, or to do a search
    without having to repeat the search every time one buys into a URL on the search
    list are functions, outside of typophile, that are basic. \r\n\r\nI have no idea
    why these functions are not basic here. "

    you feel the same about the lack of functionality.\r\n\r\nHave to make the best
    of it for now... \r\n\r\nEven with these drawbacks, the community opinions are
    valuable.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, growing pains.\r\n\r\nWnf\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If the powers that be are interested, here is an observation from someone
    who frequently accesses this site with a BlackBerry. \r\n\r\nFor some reason,
    on two occasions that I have edited posts, the result has been a double post.
    This is not something that it is a regular problem and it has not happened on
    other discussion groups that are BlackBerry accessible, which most of them are
    (with varying degrees of BB friendliness). \r\n\r\nBlackBerry friendliness is
    probably not the highest priority of the people who run this site, but I believe
    that BB type technology is rapidly going to become pervasive. \r\n\r\nJust a suggestion
    that access by small wireless devices not be ignored. "

  body: RSS it works for me, too.  I just inquired (I think kind Jared Benson) time
    ago about the possibility of having a number on the left of the threads titles
    (as I read them in Safari), logically the same number of the node (e.g. 20178),
    because it happens I need to remember a thread, I don't bookmark it, some days
    passes and I get a super bouma speed feeling scrolling through the titles.
