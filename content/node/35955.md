  grid on when drawing letters and placing points on the grid to ensure that the font
  renders well onscreen. But this does not make drawing stuff very convenient, and
  can get wonky if the grid has been changed to a larger unit size. I can\u2019t find
  anything about this in <em>Learn Fontlab Fast</em>, so I am starting to think that
  I misunderstood Jimmy and so I was hoping that someone could explain this stuff
  to me, or just tell me that I hallucinated the whole idea."

    although I only use Copy/Paste offset, Snap-to distance, and Shift+arrow keys
    increment.\r\nI have no idea what \"Visual ascender and descender\" is."

    all of the points on one of the grid lines, which Jimmy claimed would help with
    displaying the font on screen and hinting it. Maybe I\u2019ll just email him tomorrow
    and see if this is just one of those old Fog issues that is not relevant to Fontlab."

  body: "You don't need to worry about the \"micro grid\", i.e. the unit grid, in
    FontLab Studio. All the points automatically snap to integer coordinates, as this
    is a requirement of the font formats. In Fontographer, you need to manually invoke
    the \"Align Points to Grid\" command, otherwise the results of rounding may be
    a bit unpredictable. In addition to the unit grid, FontLab Studio offers a \"macro
    grid\" every 100 units, or whatever you choose it to be. This is useful for drawing
    pixelfonts (outline fonts where \"staircase outlines\" simulate pixel appearance)
    or other sorts of highly regularized designs. \r\n\r\nWhat IS important in FontLab
    Studio for better screen appearance is that after you have drawn your typeface,
    you choose Tools / Action / Hints and Guidelines / Autohint (and enable the \"Apply
    to entire font\" option), and then go to File / Font Info / Hinting Settings,
    and click on the \"Auto zones\" button, and on the next page, you click on the
    \"Auto stems\" button). Performing these three simple steps will ensure much better
    screen appearance of the font than not doing it. \r\n\r\nA."
