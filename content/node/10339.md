  body: The only way I know is to expand the class-base kerning, then make &amp; edit
    an AFM to read back in. I did that to a font recently -- over half the kerns were
    between lower-case letters and small capitals . . . somebody not wanting to bother
    to make another class, I guess. <BR> <BR>FWIW <BR> <BR>Charles
