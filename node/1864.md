  Universe <BR> <BR>Up until today I was confident that I was making the correct choices
  when it comes to caps in headlines that use upper and lower. In the above example
  I would use the top one. Is that even correct though? Should <i>the</i> be <i>The?</i>
  <BR> <BR>Specifically, the one you see below is what brought this on. <BR> <BR>Designed
  For the Collector <BR> <BR>Wondering if it should be <i>Designed For The Collector</i>
  has got my head in a spin. This is about to be printed as <i>Designed For the Collector</i>
  <BR> <BR>AAHHHH HELP! <BR> <BR>Is there a good resource for this type of thing?
  Book? Site?

  body: I own Elements of Typographic Style and have yet to see any info on it. I
    randomly flip to the section I am looking for rather than read cover to cover
    like I should. <BR> <BR>The Chicago Manual of Style looks like it might be my
    source. I heard of this book from, ironically, Elements of Typographic Style and
    have been meaning to investigate. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: 'For what its worth, <i>Fowler&#39;s Modern English Usage</i> says: &#34;Let
    it be repeated: the employment of capitals is a matter not of rules but of taste&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>For an idea of the kind of work this is, though, try this comment on
    newspaper headlines: &#34;If sometimes there is a touch of vulgarity in them,
    that is not likely to lessen their appeal to the average newspaper reader&#34;. '

    in the headline capitalized. I showed them the latest commarts, but it didn&#39;t
    really mean anything to them. =&#41; I tried to reason it out saying that indefinite
    articles and prepositions shouldn&#39;t be capitalized, but then they said something
    like not all articles are indefinite. &#40;ha, I made that up, but they said something
    like that.&#41; Since I didn&#39;t have my 5th grade english book on hand, I said..
    ok. But I ended up changing the headline style completely, to avoid the problem.
    ;&#41;  Those style books are awful though. The Kate Turabian, C MoS,  etc, to
    me,  are for term papers, not for design in the real world. They also say to use
    double hyphens with no mention of what an em dash is, and that sentences should
    have two spaces after them. I vote for whatever reads best, although one could
    argue that grammatical &#34;mistakes&#34; as some might call them hinder reading.
    Certainly &#34;Masters Of The Universe&#34; isn&#39;t as quick of a read, to me.
    But the power that the capitalized letters lends to the phrase shouldn&#39;t be
    overlooked. Although I think from the show, both of those were capitalized. Now
    I&#39;m going to be looking up He-man websites all night to find out. '

  body: Steve is right. As long as you define your publication&#39;s style <BR>and
    stick with it, the scheme doesn&#39;t matter so much. As <BR>long as you&#39;re
    consistent your product will look professional. <BR> <BR>Ask the <i>New York Times</i>,
    they use an apostrophe in their <BR>plural years &#40;1990&#39;s&#41; while nearly
    everyone else writes it <BR>without the apos. Personally, I think it&#39;s a dumb
    choice, but  <BR>it looks right in the <i>Times</i> because they have used that  <BR>style
    consistently forever.

  body: 'Kent Lew couldn&#39;t post this morn. He wishes to add this: <BR> <BR>Capitalization
    is generally an editorial matter, not a typographic one. This is definitely true
    in publishing, less so in advertising.  <BR> <BR>As such, editorial style guides
    should be followed. There are valid arguments for various styles; the important
    thing is to determine a style and then apply it consistently. If you&#39;re working
    for a publishing client, you darn well better follow their editorial style. If
    not, then pick a style and stick with it. <BR> <BR>In establishing an editorial
    style, most publishers will follow one of the two main style guides -- The Chicago
    Manual of Style, which began as merely the house style of the University of Chicago
    Press but later became popular for its thoroughness and widely adopted by most
    other publishers; and AP style, which is the style of the Associated Press and
    is widely used by newspapers, as well as some publishers.  <BR> <BR>-- K.'

  body: Sorry to sound like a nitpicky editor, but I must clear the CMoS name on a
    couple of points. It doesn&#39;t say to use double hyphens instead of em dashes.
    &#40;It says that in a manuscript, that is a piece of writing being prepared for
    eventual typesetting and publication, double hyphens should stand in for em dashes,
    which will then be replaced by the typesetter.&#41; And it calls for only one
    space to follow a sentence.  <BR> <BR>Turabian really is for papers. CMoS is for
    scholars and other non-publishing-types to prepare their work for eventual publication,
    and for editors in publishing to prepare that work for typesetting. That&#39;s
    a pretty big distinction. <BR> <BR>As someone who deals with both editorial and
    typographic matters, I tend to think it&#39;s possible to be picky about both
    without much conflict.

  body: One advantage of the &#34;All Initials Capitalized&#34; style is that you
    don&#39;t get descenders on capitalized letters. Hence its poularity in the 1970&#39;s
    and 80&#39;s in hyper-tight, negative-leading ad headlines. And with word spaces
    reduced to less than zero, the capitalization served to differentiate words.  <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19537.jpg" alt="8Ways"> <BR>
    <BR>However, the disadvantage is that you also get the situation where the &#34;f&#34;
    of &#34;Of&#34; runs into the &#34;T&#34; of &#34;The&#34;, bridging the space,
    especially in faces like Garamond. Not a problem in Palatino, though. <BR> <BR>These
    are the kind of typographic factors that can influence the style decision, quite
    apart from the purely editorial.

    set in Helvetica Extra Light Extended tracked to a &#43;120. <BR> <BR>Remember
    that tight letter fit, and negative leading were a reaction to the freedom that
    photo-type brought after all of metal&#39;s limitations. Some of it was, no doubt,
    excessive. <BR> <BR>And we all know that the freedom brought by digital type never
    produced anything that was ugly or contrived, don&#39;t we now.

    I officially apologize for the style guide bashing! Next time I&#39;ll double
    check my facts. I was sure I had read it somewhere, but Turabian, in fact, says
    this: &#34;The dash, which in printing is an elongated hyphen called an em dash,
    in typescript consists of two hyphens with no space...&#34; etc. It was perhaps
    MLA that I was thinking of, which says &#34;in typing, use two hyphens...&#34;
    etc.  <BR> <BR>I was mostly questioning the application of style guides for research
