  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there, i&rsquo;m trying to come up with a logo for a new recruitment agency called &lsquo;alignment&rsquo; focusing on staff with online skills. they&rsquo;re wanting sleek/fast/smart logo, the point being they bring disparate objects together, hence the name. so far this is what i&rsquo;ve got. i&rsquo;d really like to work something typographically but finding it a bit hard. the trouble i&rsquo;ve had is that alignment in is kind of taken for granted, it&rsquo;s only when it&rsquo;s not aligned that we notice so therefore I feel it needs to be more dynamic, with some sense of movement, as a purely &lsquo;unaligned&rsquo; or disjointed logo just doesn&rsquo;t work. any ideas? i don&rsquo;t think the hand ones are really that sleek enough, but it was just an angle i was trying. Also unsure about an icon thingee. rather than go for lines i was thinking more like planets or light refracting/focusing. any-which-ways, any advice would be much appreciated!</div>

While it&rsquo;s showing the &lsquo;a&rsquo; in &lsquo;Alignment,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s also got these dots that form a neat grid, despite the fact that the dots are connected at various angles. That direction seems closest to the idea  of &lsquo;bringing disparate objects together.&rsquo;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Dana, 6a seems the the best from what you have posted here. What&rsquo;s good about is what you did with it however. The type itself is quite rough &amp; unfinnished in feeling. I would look for a font that has more legibilty. This one is a bit hard to decipher.</p>
<p>I also wonder if you could put a cross hair at the end of alighment. It would look like</p>
<p>Alighnmen+</p>
<p>Cross hairs are the cheese so I hesitate to suggest it. But it would read &amp; is simple. Also crosshairs as used by printers feel culturaloly different than those used on say - hunting rifles.</p>
<p>Maybe it wont read&hellip;</p>
<p>But I think it could be good to keep going even as you work up an idea that seems promising.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">You need to work on your spacing. Everything is too tight. Try this, make the mark as small as you would ever use it and see if you can print it out without plugging. Many corporate logos have specific spacing for different usage as: sizing for print or signage. I would also get away from your computer and explore new ideas for Alignment. Did you look at type on a perspective casting a shadow. Type as blocks. See what I mean, just sketch, let your creativity come out and don&rsquo;t worry about the limitations of the computer.</div>

I have to agree then about A6, and I want to add 8b, I am not sure of arrow shape inside that logo, because I find arrows and triangels are disrtub the eye. but the idea still make sense for me.
good job</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ashley some ideas in general. Do me one favor don&rsquo;t use Avant Guard ligatures until you have studied Herb Lubalin&rsquo;s work extensively. Its at best, its a long learning curve. The problem with logos are end use. Make a list of all the end usage and any idea that doesn&rsquo;t fit the end usage is probably the wrong idea. This is a general principial and its a rule thats waiting to be broken. Work on your logo in black and white and investigate color when you are in testing mode. Test the logo! Make the design process into baby steps. Don&rsquo;t try to solve all problems at the same time.</div>

For an example I am not sure what A.1 message is? it looks like atoms. And what B.2 says? just an a with shadow and nice drawing for circle frame by shadow .. good artistic work but what is behind these shapes are telling me about alignment, and the reason they select alignment as a name to describe their service.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ashley, who is your audience. Ask your self this question before any project. Then when making a design ask your self will they get it. A lot of your work seems like an inside joke with only the ones in the know will get it. Think about the common user and you will come up with simple solutions that communicate effectively. Isn&rsquo;t communications the goal or is it art for arts sake. Remember the logo isn&rsquo;t going to be alone in the communications effort. You will have supporting copy and possibly a tag line. Don&rsquo;t try to make the logo do all of the communications effort. Its like a acting troop, the logo doesn&rsquo;t need to be the star but a supporting member of the cast.</div>

Good idea here, having 4 parts aligened verticaly can point  they bring separated objects aligened together. changing one of their colors &quot; the dot of i &quot; can mean there is no matter what object is. I just disagree with changing porportions of &ldquo;i&rdquo;&rsquo;s dot for this trade gothic ( or alike ) font .. you may use red color.</p>
<p>for the other logo let me ask why avant garde? This font was basically done for being a logo for some magazine, and by just typing it is making me feel you redo the same logo of that magazine.. it need some more work to get it from that.</p>
<p>for 3 logos at top they are good start for something, I don&rsquo;t have a clear message yet from them. But may be another try will bring something.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">hehe.sounds like the chicken or the egg question! i was thinking the icon things at the top would probably have to work together with the logo, perhaps two colours for the parts or the a (can you even see that?!) to suggest a coming together. I get your idea eben about just a dot. it was kind of the problem i was having before in that yes it is aligned, but that&rsquo;s not immediately realised, because in some way that is taken for granted with all typefaces. it is no more aligned than usual type so you&rsquo;d need something more &lsquo;aligned&rsquo; (?) or something unaligned (which then negates the brand, so i don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s good) in order to suggest alignment. sorry if that doesn&rsquo;t make sense. but thanks again guys&amp;girls!</div>

Colours would help this proposition but as Dan said you should work toward that from a black version.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey there,
You know I was thinking that you could really make a leap here and use something other than the simplistic alignment of shapes. You can make a visual connection by using other things that align. Furthermore, if you could incorporate a cliché or saying visually that would make it pop even more. Do a wordlist and really think of the different things that align. Think living, breathing, alive. Soldiers line up and this company recruits, there may be a great visual there. &ldquo;get your ducks in a row&rdquo; is a good one-liner that brings up very visual thoughts. Since this is a recruitment firm you may want to be warmer and down-to-earth. Anyway, these are just some things to think about and mull over. Good luck!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If this is being directed towards a human resources company I would really think about what they <em>do</em> for people. They give personal attention to help people with their lives in and outside of a work environment. I think you really captured a human connection with a few of them.</p>
<p>8B specifically: the adjustment and markers on the &ldquo;g&rdquo; scream personal attention. It is a graceful and clever way to say, &ldquo;Hey nobody&rsquo;s perfect, and we&rsquo;ll help you figure this out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>page 2 #1-4: these examples also include an element of human touch. I would encourage you to include these non-typographic additions. It gives them more warmth.</p>
<p>The AvantGarde examples feel cramped and uncomfortable. Would you want to work between the &ldquo;l&rdquo; and the &ldquo;g&rdquo; in 1-5 columns A and B? I wouldn&rsquo;t. :)</p>
