  body: from a recent hellish &#34;but-not-created-by-me&#34; experience I will suggest
    avoiding any continuous tone art unless you have &#40;A&#41; a printer that can
    not only show you past work but also guarantee their work, &#40;B&#41; a lot of
    money to reproduce it in the way they must, ergo multiple plates. <BR> <BR>other
    than that, nice thread idea. :^&#41;
