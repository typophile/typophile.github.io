  body: "Wow! To make sure the drawing didn't scale wrong in the copy, I used to make
    an Em square, incl. baseline, and copy that along with the glyph. It reminded
    me, always, of the cartoon with the portable hole that the cat-burgler character
    would use to get loot through windows and escape from the cops. \r\n\r\nI was
    moving whole cases back and forth then just to change serifs, or all of a stem
    type, or importing logos. Do other people use this path in the design porocess
    nowadays, or is it primarily an entry level, or very-special-case path. Also wondering
    if anyone knows of a InD/FL path? :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think it's mainly people who can't get used to drawing directly in FontLab
    (i.e., wimps). Seriously, there are some procedures which are easier to do in
    Illustrator, which is reason enough to use it in many cases. But you can always
    go from FL > Illustrator > FL if you just need to run a special Illustrator filter
    on a glyph or whatever. As a routine method for drawing glyphs, though, working
    in Illustrator involves quite a few extra steps and seems inefficient to me now.
    (I used to work that way.)

    file out of InDesign, then run through GhostScript's free \"ps2ai\" utility and
    import the resulting file into FontLab. It's easy. The most dreadful step for
    many people will be using the command-line GhostScript. :)\r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

    out of a well-worn, smooth groove. Immersion into a particular interface is just
    as important/efficient as the power -and even elegance- of an interface.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I sometimes start putting letterforms together in FreeHand, which is my drawing
    program of comfort/choice. But once outlines are in FLab, that's where I work
    on them. (Quite often these days, I will start drawing in FLab.) \r\n\r\nOne of
    the greatest benefits of this \"workflow\", or \"workpuddle\", is that there are
    no surprises with nodes and BCPs aligning to whole units on the em grid. If you
    develop a font with a lowercase \"i\" with a vertical stroke width of, say, 25
    units, and you want to center a 30-unit wide dot, you can make that in AI or FH,
    but it won't fly in FLab. Likewise, if you wanted a 29-unit wide dot on your i,
    you couldn't have a perfect circle, since the midpoint of 29 is 14.5, and decimals
    are verboten.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, FOG gave us the false impression that we could
    work in decimals and half-units, but the app then \"flattened\" points and handles
    when the fonts were generated."
