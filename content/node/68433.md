  body: "As for the one listed here:\r\nhttp://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/bodoni.htm\r\n\r\nIt's
    not clear if it's in PS or TTF format.\r\nIf the latter is the case, since OS
    X, Macs are capable to use Windows TTF fonts.\r\nMoreover, with Adobe apps you
    could place Windows PS fonts in the application Fonts folder and you can use it."
