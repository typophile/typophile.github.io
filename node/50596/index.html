  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear all (and especially those of you familiar with [[cyrillic]])

Making italics for a typeface that contains the cyrillic letter ghe stroke, I am having difficulties finding any information on what the (lower case) italic version of this letter looks like.
Is it just a slanted version of the upright, or does it follow the rule of ghe (and in that case: how is the stroke applied), or is it something third?

Your help will be deeply appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's a good if hard-to-parse response on this exact question from the ATypI list, when I asked about it last January. Victor Kharyk is a type designer and scholar of Cyrillic letterforms.

He wrote:

Look, if anybody, for example, ask here what is the form of Latin g -
you will answer:
"it is a lot of forms relative to typestyles, history, different
national traditions etc". The same is with Cyrillic letters, especialy with
ghe ang its sisters.
 CAPS is the same in all "Cyrillic Slavonic countries" and Greece.
Roman-styled lower case is the same, exept modern Bulgaria (circa last
30 years), where "reversed s" is prefered (naturaly the direction of stress must be
corrected).

 Italic lower case have reversed s-form in all countries, exept Serbia
and Macedonia, where prefered form looked as i macron (and the
same with macron and acute together for Macedonian u0453)

 Ukrainian "explosive" ghe u0491 is relatively new letter and its
developement were stoped in soviet time, thats why research of its
forms not finish till now. There are some historical forms relatived to
some forms of Greek gamma (with long tale under the baseline)- this
form and its development seems good for "quill tradition", other
"dropped pen tradition" come in early 20th century (we can see it in
works of Georgiy Narbut) - this form used in modern school-books. New
form (reversed s with "strich" bottom left) was proposed few years ago
by Hennadij Zarechnjuk (Hennadiy Zarechniuk) from Lviv and also in use. It is mean that
italic form of this letter must be designed in every font relatively
to its style, as like as any other letter:)

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Thomas

Thank you very much, though I am not sure exactly what to conclude regarding ghe stroke, since this Viktor's answer is concerned with u0491 and not u0493.

As I see it, there are two options: a) no final conclusion has been reached as how to draw this letter (either oblique or "reversed s") and therefore it is optional, or is it b) that the ghe stroke should follow the shape of ghe. In my case, a sans serif, I have a "reversed s" ghe and an oblique ghe upstroke. So I guess that, if option a is valid, I could go for the oblique ghe stroke without making Uzbek eyes sore... </div>
