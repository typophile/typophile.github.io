  designers (who would have a totally different answer, I think).\r\n\r\nHow much
  money should an independent graphic designer, working alone or in a small group
  (two or three), budget each year for font purchases? Five percent? For a solo act
  doing $100,000 a year gross, that is $5000. That should be enough to keep the library
  current.\r\n\r\nWhat do others think or do?"

  body: That sounds like a good number. That wouldn't buy everything worth having,
    but would get you quite well set up.

    one does. Typefaces are really applicable to the individual project more so than
    the overall business. Buy what you need. '

  body: "Am I missing something here?\r\n\r\nSo designers buy a basic set of fonts
    when they start (I assume you don't start with nothing and only acquire faces
    as you get initial jobs). Then they only buy fonts when needed for a job, and
    have the customer pay. Does that mean you are spec'ing fonts that you have never
    used before? What do you go on to spec the font then ... just the samples from
    the typehouse, or some other more detailed process?"

    we collect a large set of tools.\r\n\r\nIt's nice to have a beginner set of tools,
    but unless you know exactly what you are fixing/building, you're just guessing
    at what you need.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that a lot of the 'basic sets' are collected
    through indirect means...free faces, all the bundled fonts with Adobe products,
    system faces, etc."
