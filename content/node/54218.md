  but can't put a name on it or find it. Here is an example:\r\nhttp://cloverstornetta.com/images/products/Products_Header.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  for you help guys.\r\n\r\nGnagnu"

    Heavy \r\n(looks like the \"original\" rather than the ITC version). \r\nAnd it
    <em>is</em> lovely! Somewhat overused for a while, but lovely nonetheless. :-)"

    through before posting...)\r\n\r\nVery lovely indeed! For me it somehow evokes
    the US. I hadn't seen it that much in Europe.\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\nGnagnu"

    round the corner from where I live has that up, large, green, & backlit. Yum.
    \r\nAnd it's a German design btw, by Rudolf Koch."

    a slant, tell it all. :)"

  body: Ahead of it's time in some ways... How many lower case b's were that shape
    back when Kabel was created? Still looks as good today as ever I think. I only
    ever saw the ITC version, but research the original now :)

  body: "I linked to the Linotype version above. I wonder what the ITC version came
    with? \r\nI have that on my computer for some reason.\r\n\r\nAnd, I shouldn't
    have said \"original\" of course. In fact, there appear to have been rather different
    cuts even back in metal type; <a href=\"http://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=57&idart=981\">this
    version</a> (Klingspor, 1927; click on the image to enlarge) doesn't have that
    sexy \"g\" \u2013 and much shorter ascenders than <a href=\"http://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=57&idart=980\">this
    lighter one</a> (apparently also Klingspor, 1927), which looks somewhat similar
    to the Linotype version linked to above \u2013 though this one has the slanted
    terminals!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't know anywhere near enough about type
    in the metal age \r\nto comment on the differences, except that they bewilder
    me somewhat."
