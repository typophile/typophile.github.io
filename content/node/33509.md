body: "I have a collection of about 2000 one inch photolettering film strips. About
  half are in nice wooden storage racks, the rest are in plastic storage boxes.\r\n\r\nThe
  designs are mostly common typefaces (Helvetica, Univers, ITC etc) but there are
  a few gems in there as well.\r\n\r\nThey have been stored in a store cupboard in
  the office that we use \u2013 free from damp and frost, but now they have to go!
  I am willing to give them to a good home (yes give!)- anyone who wants to come and
  pick them up is welcome to them.\r\n\r\nWe cannot ship them anywhere, if you would
  like them you must come and pick up, and you will need a small van and a bit of
  muscle to do so.\r\n\r\nIf you want any further information please drop me an email:\r\nMwooden
  at dtptypes dot com\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMalcolm\r\n"
