  I am surprised at the number of typefaces that omit a small cap variant of the dollar
  sign. This omission is particularly annoying as I'm trying to use all small caps
  in a promotional environment. \r\n\r\nAmong the type design community, does this
  seem like an important glyph or is my need obscure? I'd be interested to hear perspectives
  on this exceedingly small concern. Any favorites that do have it? Legato is a favorite
  of mine that doesn't actually have it but is sized to work in either case."

    has small caps figures, and dollar sign. I think that Riccardo is right about
    the absence going with no small caps figures. I found them useful in a book for
    discrete citations of sources in parentheses (which were also small caps). '

  body: Not only small-cap dollar signs -- but ones for old-style figures, too. In
    the Type 1 days, Monotype, anyway, had a number of old-style monetary symbols.When
    they're not there (and the EULA allows), we make them up.

    Pro, Pratt Pro, Parity, Paradigm Pro, Scotch Modern.\r\n\r\nMy practice is to
    have the Small Caps feature effect only lower case letters, and have All Small
    Caps also turn capitals and figures (whether old style or lining) and monetary
    symbols into small-cap-height lining glyphs.\r\n\r\nHowever, most browsers do
    not yet support OT features.\r\n\r\nTherefore you need to have a separate Small
    Caps web font, and the figure style for that would be oldstyle\u2014SC+OSF\u2014with
    default cap-lining monetary symbols. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t see the point
    of producing those extra fonts, as I\u2019d rather wait for browsers to support
    OT features, which seems to be the trajectory the industry is taking.\r\n\r\nSo,
    to get what you want now, you\u2019d need a third \u201CAll Small Caps, Small
    Figures & Small Monetary Symbols\u201D font, with lining small-cap-height figures
    and monetary symbols.\r\n\r\nA small-cap-lining dollar with old style figures
    is wrong.\r\n\r\n"

      the value starts with a 6 or an 8: $87.99, $6.2 million. But with others it
      looks weird: $92.40, $3.2 million. If you hate yourself you can use the Unicode
      small cap s character (\u1D1C+\u1D00731) and the combining short solidus overlay
      (\u1D1C+0337) as a crude facsimile of a small cap dollar \u2013 \uA731\u0337

    signs and \"shift the baseline down\" with everything but a following  6 or 8.
    If you look at the older Monotype Type 1 *sterling* character, that's essentially
    what they did.\r\n\r\nWhen I make them up for os figs in a font editing program,
    I usually  make them a little smaller, but also lower them a little. Scaling only,
    either in InDesign or an editing program,  doesn't work too well, as the weight
    becomes too thin. You could maybe scale them to 95% vertical without a weight
    change. If you scale then in InDesign, you'll lose any kerning..."

    and tradition are powerful design devices, the roots of it, I dare say, but we\u2019re

    more stringent typographic rules for print than I'm able in the browser.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><cite>My

    completely agree, Nick. A complete set of figures should include lining, text,
    and small cap (all in tab and proportional). The currency sorts should be drawn
    to coordinate with those features.\r\n\r\nWhitman and Williams Caslon are favorites
