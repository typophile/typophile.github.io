  body: "I knew I had already seen this. Previously asked [[http://typophile.com/node/94337|here]]
    but still unresolved. I've found meanwhile the sample origin, a poster by Mark
    Owens ([[http://www.lifeofthemind.net|lifeofthemind.net]]?) for the [[http://graphicmag.kr/poster_issue/|Poster
    Issue]] of Korean [[http://graphicmag.kr|Graphic Magazine]]. I've found also a
    better sample [[http://graphicmag.kr/poster_issue/posters/11.jpg|here]]. Looks
    definitely like a mix of Futura (/L, /D, /U, /E with middle bar lowered and /S)
    and Avenir (/M with vertex reworked, /C, /G with horizontal bar lowered, /A and
    /R).\r\nYou might like [[http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Brown/|Brown]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/11_3714.jpg]"
