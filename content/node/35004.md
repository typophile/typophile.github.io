  the method described here to correct the curve shape\r\n\r\nhttp://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.34.curves.htm\r\n\r\nThis
  method shows really good results for glyphs such as O,S,C,D etc. but with glyphs
  like P, R and B the results aren't as good. Does anyone have any advise on this
  matter or know of other methods to help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P_5462.gif]"

  body: I'm a user of this method, but only on the round characters, those with horizontal
    stokes never get rotated and need more manula correction, though less than if
    they were rotated and then you had to fix 'em.

  body: "IMO you have to develop an eye (and hand) for tweaking these curves manually.\r\nOne
    method is to mechanically slant your roman type, then put a similar glyph from
    Helvetica, Futura, whatever, in the mask layer, and see how your BCPs and handles
    have to be moved to get correspondence.\r\nNote in particular that the extrema
    \"slant line\" in many faces differs for curved and straight letters, and may
    even vary between O and S.\r\nLooking at the shapes sideways, upside down, and
    back to front also helps."
