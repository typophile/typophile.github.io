  anyone could throw out good typefaces for wedding invitations (i'm designing my
  own right now). I'm drawn to Ministry and Marmalade right now. I'm also looking
  for a good typeface to accompany these...\r\n\r\nthank you!!"

  body: "Some may disagree, I think Bickham Script Pro from Adobe is a very versatile
    typeface, with a slew of alternates, glyphs and ornaments. Sloop from the Font
    Bureau is another fav, although so many designers use it incorrectly, not utilizing
    all three faces for Caps, ascenders and descenders. The worst faux pax is spacing
    or kerning out script faces.\r\n\r\nAs for an accent font stick with a traditional
    serif, Incognito from Fountain Type is good example, something with oldstyle figures.\r\n\r\nMy
    last comment, nothing shows off a well-designed invitation better than Letterpress\u2026\r\n\r\nCongratulations!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    some complementary typefaces here?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com\r\n\r\nAnd yes
    congratulations!"

    or Sudestada for our names -- I was wondering what would be a nice font to use
    with those for the rest of the body text?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be appreciated!!"
