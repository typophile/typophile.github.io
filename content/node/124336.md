body: 'I''d like to find a typeface that also has an alternate swash version. Something
  with a bit of flair and style, with or without serifs. The main thing is the ability
  to switch to an alternate swash version of a letter without relying on OTF glyphs.
  I''m hope I''m not being too confusing. Thanks for any ideas! '

  body: "I'm hoping for a reasonably-priced typeface, and I'm open to just upper-case.
    I'd like to make the attached \"Richard Drake\" logo a bit more lively, with flair.
    I realize those words don't help too much. I wouldn't mind trying a sans serif
    typeface. I really just want the basic style of swash & regular. \r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help! "

    it's free! \r\n\r\nThank you all!! \r\n\r\n- Bob"
