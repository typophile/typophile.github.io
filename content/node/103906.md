  after the font used for the 'F' character. I appreciate this may be difficult (or
  impossible) with just one letter, but hopefully someone out there will know!\r\n\r\nAny
  help greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nHennree"

    letters in a book on medi\xE6val lettering and illumination. Dover Books has several
    at very reasonable prices."

  body: "This fancy letter would have been drawn by a monk illuminating a medieval
    manuscript. The sample image is small but the F seems to include Celtic knots,
    a common theme in the initial letters used in famous manuscripts such as the Irish
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells\">_Book of Kells_</a>. \r\nToo
    fancy for a font, but a vector version of this F may be available. A Google search
    for <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/search?q=vector+celtic+illuminated+manuscripts&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=rhK_UZKxJMLVqAGcn4C4CQ&ved=0CCoQsAQ&biw=1074&bih=906
    \">vector Celtic illuminated manuscripts</a> will lead you to similar letters,
    and with some perseverance you might find a vector of the initial F used on the
    book cover.\r\nA good assortment of old fancy initial capitals, but not including
    this particular F, can be found at <a href=\"http://www.aridi.com/index.php/component/content/article?id=41\">Aridi
    initial capitals</a>. \r\nDon"
