body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nLooking to identify one of the typefaces used in the attached
  scan. It's the smaller \"dotted\" one I'm after \u2013\_\"CALL FOR APPLICATIONS
  / JAN VAN EYCK POST-ACADEMIC INSTITUTE\" etc. Spacing/fitting of the dots looks
  too good to be done with dotted lines in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nThe scan is from p86
  of Phaidon's <em>AREA 2: 100 Graphic Designers, 10 Curators, 10 Design Classics</em>,
  and it is the work of Dutch designers Cobbenhagen & Hendriksen.\r\n \r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n(<a

  just in case \u2013\_not sure how attachments show up here</a>).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPat"

  body: That other thread mentions a typeface called Pinball. I concur that Pinball
    is what was used here. There is a partial showing in the Solotype Catalog (predigital),
    including a lowercase. I've never seen it digitally, though.

  body: "Thanks Jan, Mike, and Florian for your responses. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/club_21/frieze_ot/\">Frieze</a>
    mentioned in the other thread would probably be a passable match if it had a lowercase...\r\n\r\nI
    only need eight characters, actually, so I might just draw them myself.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPat"
