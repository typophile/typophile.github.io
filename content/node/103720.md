  body: "First, looks like a hand-lettering to me. All repeating letters are different
    (3 /S, 3 /E, 2 /R, 2 /P...).\r\nSecond, I was unable to spot a font that could
    match all these specific letters. Looks like it mixes different styles of font
    (at least 2): /S (/T, /A, /L...) on one side and /P, /R, /O and /P on the other.
    \ May be mixing some of these ones would be interesting: [[http://youngjerks.com/#/highway-typeface|Highway]]
