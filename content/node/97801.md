  in All-Caps for a presentation, but I can't seem to find many font combinations
  that I'm falling in love with with this font in particular.\r\n\r\nI was wondering
  if anyone might have recommendations for font pairings?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ncosmo[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mp1_vogue-sans_1_4836.png]"

    remove the name and link; you could leave in the image so people can still help
    you find the real thing and/or a good pairing.\r\n\r\nBTW does the slot for the
    \"dumb\" double-quotes actually contain the text \"USE REAL QUOTES\"? Funny. But
    don't they realize dumb quotes can be useful too? Anyway.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      this might be a dumb question, but how do I edit posts after posting? I don't
      see an option to do so..."

  body: "If that's a pirated/cloned/copied design, I couldn't find any other font,
    commercial or free, that matched it enough. Neither Durak, as suggested by R.,
    nor any of those suggested by WhatTheFont, Identifont, or WhatFont Is. These included
    Cotoris, Koala, Vandermar, and Darjeeling. Other than combining heavy strokes
    and thin strokes, they have little in common. \r\n\r\nWhat VogueSans really looks
    like is exactly what its name says: The Vogue Magazine nameplate typeface with
    the serifs clipped off.\r\n\r\n  - Herb "

    most like Vogue's imo.\r\nIsn't [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-alias/perla/regular/|this]]
    beautiful ? :3\r\n"

  body: "@Noorett - Perla is close, but not the same. Major differences in  C, J,
    Q, W and others.  Not to mention that Perla is a serif font.\r\n\r\n@Nick - I've
    found a half-dozen different fonts all named 'Vogue'. Your 1932 sample is probably
    one of the first. The Vogue in your image (the lower case letters) was matched
    by WhatTheFont to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/simplo/medium/glyphs.html|\"Simplo
    Medium\"]] by Durotype. The headline, in \"Stellar\", is matched by Spiece Graphics'
    Stellar Classic.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
