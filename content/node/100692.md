  Is this typeface not readily available for purchase?\r\n\r\nAny help with this would
  be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: Retina was commissioned by the Wall Street Journal, and so far as I know they
    retain exclusive usage rights. It's possible that the contract between the WSJ
    and Hoefler & Frere-Jones will allow H&F-J to license the font to other customers
    at some time, but I don't recall any announcement of a specific period of exclusivity.

  body: Retina is used by numerous newspapers and magazines. It's definitely available
    for license, but you'll have to contact HFJ directly since it's not on their website.

  body: I always misread that initialism and wonder what kind of special justification
    is done with H&FJ versus ordinary hyphenation and justification.

    as possible.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it is when the J is FUBAR."
