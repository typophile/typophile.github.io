  body: How about Legacy Serif and Sans? The sans is humanist, attractive. See the
    American Signature Homes website for examples of its use for titling and text.

    target="_blank">pjay&#39;s suggestion</a>. <BR>ITC Legacy has done me well in

    fan.

  body: ITC Legacy sans is simular to Gill Sans, if that is what you are looking for,
    but if you want something fresh, look at Today Sans, this is humanist font that
    is not chunky as Gill Sans or ITC Legacy. Today medium is more consistent than
    Gill Sans <BR><a href="http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=Today+Sans&amp;producttype=TYP"

  body: Great suggestions, I find Today Sans a very good choice, the darkest weights
    are lovable. Legacy is a good choice too because it has a perfect matching serif.

  body: What about Albertina? It seems to me to be close enough to Cronos to look
    compatible, but with enough tension to provide contrast. It&#39;s distinctly humanist,
    but not antiquarian. It&#39;s not overused. It&#39;s very easy to work with.

    I&#39;m looking at Bliss and Legato as possibilities.

    per weight.
