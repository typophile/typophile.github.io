  the feeling it&#39;s really ready. I have some hunches about what could be the problem,
  but I&#39;m curious to hear what you all think should be changed. <BR>If you have
  any suggestions, please tell me. Before I will create the whole family I want that
  the basic is OK. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: RV_Nordic_pres-15231.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*22.6*Nordic+Narrow+Light*RV%a9Nordic+pres%2epdf

  body: Hmmm, I see what you mean, Neil. Do you have any suggestions perhaps on how
    to spice the Y/y up?  <BR>And yes, I&#39;ll definately make a set of lining figures.
    I want the original type to have the OSF figures because that gives it a little
    bit flair.  <BR>You really think the V is to wide? I agree about the M, N, W.
    I&#39;ll correct them. <BR>I&#39;m also thinking about some icons/pictograms or
    numerals. But I first need some topics on what icons would be sencefull to have
    in a type like this. Something for later. <BR> <BR>The font has a 33 degree angle
    in the diagonals. Would it be a problem if, by creating the other widths, this
    angle would change? Because if I stretch the type the angle changes with it. If
    I correct this the openings in some characters &#40;a, e, p&#41; will become to
    small, because the endpoint of the angle moved to the right. <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    it&#39;s me that I want to be more than perfect and can&#39;t see that it&#39;s
    finished. I have that problem more often, so... <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Ren

    33.69 degrees instead, you&#39;d end up with a nice 1/1.5 slope, which would render
    nicer on-screen, especially in 1-bit. <BR> <BR>Degrees are dead, long live integer
    ratios! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Hrant, <BR>Just curious, but do you think hinting could force the slope to
    the 1/1.5 at the smaller sizes where it will truly matter?

  body: I think so, since hinting can do almost anything. Which is why sometimes it&#39;s
    made to do too much - but that&#39;s another thread... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: hhp, how did you calculate the angle on the slope? I&#39;m really a lousy
    mathematicion. I failed big time in highschool on that subject. <BR>Is there a
    formula that I could use in situations like this? Or do you perhaps have a url
    where I can read more on this topic? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Ren

  body: 'If you have an integer-ratio slope &#40;like 2/3&#41; in mind and want to
    get the angle: <BR>Just take its arc-tangent. ATAN&#40;0.666&#41; = ~33.69 degrees
    <BR> <BR>If you have a degree angle &#40;like 33&#41; in mind and want to find
    the closet integer-ratio slope: <BR>Take its tangent, and do a 1-over to make
    it easier to read. 1/TAN&#40;33&#41; = ~1.54 <BR>Then you [generally] have to
    decide how to round it to get a nice ratio - in this case probably 1.5 is best.

  body: Oh boy, there we go again. This goes way over my creative head.  <BR>I&#39;ll
    try to change the slope in the type. But can I ask you about the formula later,
    hhp? Only when I have something similar to this? Really, mathematics is no-no
    land for me. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Ren
