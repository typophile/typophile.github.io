    this time, but please don't make duplicate threads.

  body: The g is not very well drawn. That, plus some other inconsistencies I'm seeing,

    body: "thanks for repliying me. the sample is from a logotype, that\xB4s why it
      must be a custom work, however  I thought it would be a font quite similar to
      the sample.\r\nanyway, thanks very much and sorry for making a double post.
      I will follow your advice next time."
