  body: Thanks Dana. <BR> <BR>Sorry Dave, despite the thanks and smiley, I still managed
    to come across as a bit cocky or rude. Apologies, I didn&#39;t mean that at all.
    <BR> <BR>By the way, this is a really nice forum, I&#39;ve never come across anything
    quite like it. I don&#39;t have much in the way of knowledge to contribute, but
    I&#39;ll still enjoy lurking and reading <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    target="_blank"> Bingo.</a> I was wondering why I couldn&#39;t find Ad Sans, but
    now  <BR>I know: the only digitized version is the Bitstream renamed one. <BR>The
    text below the logo is Frutiger. FreeSet is just the renamed  <BR>alternative
    by ParaType.'

  body: Fantastic, thanks! <BR> <BR>Interestingly, I&#39;m sure I can see what seems
    an excessive amount of round overshoot in Ad Sancs. This is particularly noticeable
    on larger sizes &#40;seen here on the u, d and c, but not the o, although that
    is the same size&#41;. And that&#39;s not present on the AudioMulch logo. <BR>
    <BR>To me, it&#39;s unquestionably the same typeface though, and I can&#39;t believe
    the AudioMulch author would have tweaked his logo, so what would account for it?
    Two separately digitised versions? <BR> <BR>And oh yes, the c is quite different
    on the small text, I hadn&#39;t really looked as I was expecting it to be the
    same ! <BR> <BR>I took your advice and registered, btw <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
