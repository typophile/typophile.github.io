body: "So, it\xB4s almost a year ago, when I started to discover type that I made
  this fist typeface. At the time I had discovered the optical tricks used in professional
  typography, and though I understand the importance of it, it kind of annoyed to
  see the skewed geometry when used in big sizes.\r\n\r\n I also just wanted the experience
  of designing a font without knowing anything really, I did not even know about DIN
  at the time, Helvetica(I discovered condensed later on) was my only mental reference
  point, but I did it all in isolation. Now I have not showed it anywhere on the internet
  since I thought that there are probably already a precisely similar font since it
  is created from such simple design principles. And I am still sure there are at
  least as drafts on designers hard drives. But it turns out after a year of looking
  at typefaces I have not the exact same idea replicated, not with the honest simple
  geometry and default tight kerning. But there is DIN and Helvetica Condensed and
  UNIQLOs version of DIN... If you know of other ones I would be happy to know!\r\n\r\nBut
  the question is, do you like it? Could you use it? Would you buy it? Is it useful?\r\n\r\nWhat
  are the problems? I know the S is strange and the R is also a bit... but I have
  grown to like it...\r\n\r\nWhat I especially like, which seems to be rare is that
  the middle lines are all the same. But I know the basic argument against it.\r\n\r\nI
  do not claim that it even is a real typeface, it does not have the versatility etc,
  only a small set of characters. But I think it is kind of fun, and maybe even a
  bit unique, but in a good way?\r\n\r\nSo what is it, aggressive, neutral, boring,
  clunky, horrible, technocratic, fun?\r\n"

    you could go geometric all the way with a solution along these lines:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/esse_6598.png]\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble, but, while pleasant in its own rough
    way (and as of lately, fashionable even), your typeface can hardly be called \u201Cunique\u201C,
    even \u201Da bit\u201D ;-)"

  body: "Thanks for the honest words! However my bubble will burst only when someone
    shows me a typeface with the same qualities done better. \r\n\r\nI really like
    the S and it looks nice with the other Straight midlines.\r\n\r\nBut in a way
    it is an anti typyface since it has 0 skill, 0 secrets, no mysterious elegancy,
    no voice. And that is exactly what i like about it. But even I seldom need it.
    Idealistic neutrality.\r\n\r\nBut although I know most real typographers would
    regard it as stupid, I don't understand exactly why, other than the fact that
    it requires very little skill to make.  \r\n\r\nBut you said this style is even
    in fashion, any links?"

    look MORE geomatric if you include overshoots, slight contrast, etc?

    better to me than the ones with the optical tricks.

  body: "Some of it <em>is</em> actually working as a grunge face. It's similar to
    some \"vernacular\" fonts that play up their own ignorance and lack of refinement.
    Fonts like <a href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Chinese-Rocks\">Chinese
    Rocks</a> and <a href=\"http://hvdfonts.com/#20-HvD Poster\">HVD Poster</a>, are
    based on rough, impromptu lettering. While Cosed is much more rigid and smooth,
    I would still put them in the same category.\r\n\r\nWhat I would suggest is to
    maybe make it a little <em>more</em> awkward. Keep _S_R_O_5_K_ etc. the way they
    are and try to capture that weirdness in some other characters."

  body: "Thanks Tristan, I appreciate your understanding. Do you have any particular
    letter in mind that I could change? For me it is close to perfect according to
    the principles I set out, but I think I am blind for it.\r\n\r\nI actually have
    done lower case letters as well, but they are actually unusable since I tried
    to use the same thickness, creazy me..."

    was originally going to suggest you alter the _K_ so that the arm and leg met
    exactly at the stem, but then I thought that would make it really thin and maybe
    a bit <em>too</em> weird.\r\n\r\nYou could make the horizontal lines in _E_ and
    _F_ the same length. And if you're not opposed to breaking your rules a little,
    you could make the leg and arm of _K_ slightly narrower at the ends to mimic the
    optical effect on the _R_\r\n\r\nThat's all I can think of right now."
