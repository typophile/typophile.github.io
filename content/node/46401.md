body: "I found this Ex Libris in a book  I bought from a high quality second hand
  bookshop in Helsinki. It's in an apparently second edition J. B. Priestley's Angel
  Pavement from 1930, published by William Heinemann Ltd, London. It was obviously
  purchased by Mr. Starck in 1932, and it was no. 604 in his library.\r\n\r\nMr. Starck
  seemed to have been Karelia minded, as the two swords suggest \u2013 eastern and
  western. The same theme is in a label of a popular Finnish beer, Karjala (Karelia).\r\nKarelia
  is in the border of Finland and Russia, in 1930 it was still totally in Finland,
  now part of it belongs to Russia.\r\n\r\nThe K in Starck is pretty interesting as
  well as the \xD6 without proper umlauts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Exlibris_3744.jpg]"

  body: "When I was learning Swedish, the textbook had examples of postcards and such
    as part of its illustrations. One feature I noticed about the mimicked handwriting
    on them was that the dots of the letters \xE4 and \xF6 were not properly separated
    but replaced with something resembling tildes, so that they looked more like \xE3
    and \xF5. So I figure the improper dots must be a feature of at least some Swedish
    handwriting or must have been at some point in time. After all, in Swedish there
    is no risk of confusion to be had by not indicating the dots properly.\r\n\r\nIs
    this something that's found in Finnish handwriting at all? Or have you seen it
    at all in Finland-Swedish handwriting? I have no idea how common this is.\r\n\r\nIt
    must be unusual to see such an informal feature associated with handwriting on
    a type/lettering design like on that Ex Libris."

  body: "When I was at school the handwriting \xF6/\xD6 would have a tilde-like line
    replacing dots. It was similar to this 1930's model. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ManuPropria_eBook-56_3648.jpg]\r\n\r\nActually,
    I replace dots with a line when writing something quickly by hand, you wouldn't
    think I started with the 1930's style handwriting, would you? \r\nHere's T\xF6\xF6l\xF6
    and P\xC4\xC4 (sometimes I can't read my own writing\u2026)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/toolo_3634.jpg]"

  body: "In languages where there is no danger of confusion, the double dots of the
    printed umlaut often look like double acute accents, tildes or macrons.\r\n\r\nThis
    is natural, just a question of writing economy :-)\r\n\r\nSome decorative typefaces
    take on this feature, however this limits their usability in other languages.\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"

  body: "Look out for the new \u2018Studio Lettering\u2019 collection, soon to be
    released by [[House Industries]]!\r\n\r\nIt consists of three styles, <a href=\"http://www.tdc.org/news/2008Results/Slant.html\">Slant</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.tdc.org/news/2008Results/Sable.html\">Sable</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tdc.org/news/2008Results/Swing.html\">Swing</a>.
    \r\n\r\nAll of them feature <em>vernacular alternates</em>, which can be toggled
    via stylistic subsets in OpenType. [[Ken Barber]] got the idea to this when he
    saw the variation of the umlaut in Swedish sign-painting and handwriting. See
    also some photos by [[Peter Bruhn]]: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fountaineer/1079101663/in/pool-779590@N22\">[1]</a>,
