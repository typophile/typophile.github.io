  posted on iLT not too longer ago and I only know how begun to notice it. I'm rather
  curious: What visual and design quality do the two fonts share that make them appear
  so similar in strength and weight? Corpernicus doesn't seem to have been designed
  for Web (is it?) so I'm very interested in how the two look so alike. I have always
  like Georgia, but it's a little meaty for print so I've been interested in examining
  fonts of similar quality. Sadly, I lack the eye and vocabulary to put my finger
  on it. "

  body: "Galaxie Copernicus is a take on Plantin, a 16th-century genre, and Georgia
    is a Scotch Roman, a 19th-century genre. Plantin does have a large x-height compared
    to other designs of its era, but if you go into the details, there is very little
    similarity between the two genres and hence the two faces.\r\n\r\nHowever, Georgia,
    as you noted, was designed for the screen, and Galaxie Copernicus was designed
    as a member of the Galaxie family that includes a grotesque (a sans serif subgenre),
    so those decisions probably affected the proportions, colour, and sturdiness of
    the designs. That could be said about a lot of other contemporary designs, though."

  body: "To answer your question in the title: Not much. They\u2019re both serif typefaces.\r\nBut
    Georgia is a Scotch Roman optimized for the screen, whereas Copernicus is a typeface
    stylisticly similar to Plantin, a French Old Style face.\r\n\r\nCheck this: <a

  body: "I bought Copernicus in one weight not too long ago.\r\nI bought it because
    it was markedly different from Georgia and I wanted to test it out on screen as
    an alternate body font. (Won't get into the results of that here.) \r\nThe biggest
    diff I notice right off was the counters in the letters B, D, O, and the like.
    Much larger than Georgia.\r\n\r\nMy eye is anything but trained with regards to
    typefaces.\r\n\r\nForgive my being flip, but have you been to the optometrist
    lately? ;)"
