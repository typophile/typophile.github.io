body: "hello fellow typophiles\r\n\r\nonce again im asking for advice. for a one-day
  music festival, organized by young people and with the goal to bring nature conservancy
  to a broader (and younger) audience, i designed flyer and poster in one big rush.
  as you'd expect with such unexperienced organisators, everything was last minute.
  i used AG Super in pretty big sizes throughout flyer and poster.\r\nnow i have to
  design a 28-page festival-magazine, printed black and white  on \"nature-friendly\"
  paper - dont know which one exactly (its probably going to have a bit of a yellow
  touch).\r\n\r\ni thought about tyfa by stormtype as typeface for text, but its very
  lifely and doesnt really fit what i imagined. any good idea? i dont want to go too
  conservative, for example i dont think minion would fit the audience. the page-size
  is pretty small to save money, so i'll have to go small with type, too (would be
  8/10 or something probably).\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU!\r\n\r\nps: i'd love to use akkurat
  for text and make a sans-only out of it, but alas i dont have the money to buy akkurat
  right now and i want to buy the whole family of it."

    of its softened, experimental nature.\r\n\r\nAnd, perhaps more importantly, it
    will also set very well on your kind of paper."

  body: "thanks for \"new winchester\", looks good but i think its too conservative
    for this audience - mostly between 16 and 25.\r\n\r\nbut what would be criterias
    for a typeface for text on such kind of paper? i'd obviously not chose a bodoni
    or such, but otherwhise?"

    Delicato is a good one, but maybe my choice is still too conservative."

  body: Try a humanist slab, like PMN Caecilia or Adobe's Chaparral. Slabs are trendy,
    and these two have the added benefit of being readable in long stretches.

  body: "Back when Adobe Illustrator 4.0 was a new release it came with a pretty good
    bundle of Berthold \"BE\" faces, including AG. I thought BaskervilleBE looked
    really good with AG for its slab serifs and vertical emphasis.\r\n\r\nThat choice
    may seem a bit rigid or even tough looking. Open up the line spacing and it may
    seem more friendly.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I'd probably go with some sort of transitional
    book face for passages of text with AG."

  body: "AG Super is my personal favorite default font, so I have been using it an
    awful lot for a few years now. I generally set it in letterspaced caps. This not
    only looks good quite large, but also at a text size as a contrast to the AG Light,
    which has all the typographic trimmings. \r\n\r\nIn the instances where it needs
    a different support type, I tend to choose the exact opposite of it in the form
    a script (like Edwardian or other formal script) or a swash italic (like Adobe
    Caslon). Using a normal Mom-and-Pop roman type generally produces a cold, stodgy
    look, so I go for the more exuberant, though equally rigid, old-school script
    or italic. Rounds it out, like Laurel and Hardy.\r\n\r\nI hope I didn't just give
    away too many secrets."
