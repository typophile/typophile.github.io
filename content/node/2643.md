body: About six months ago I ran across a website that specialized in gothic looking
  and &#34;edgy&#34; fonts &#40;using updown crosses for &#39;T&#34;s and such&#41;,
  and they had a font that the whole alphabet was made by using four cryptic shapes
  turned, the shapes looked like those cheap metal ring puzzle shapes. They were a
  pay font site, and at the time I didn&#39;t have the cash.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~anastasiachaney/symbol.bmp"

  is a rough drawing of the character used for the &#34;z&#34; turned 90 degrees counter
  clockwise for the &#34;m&#34; and flipped for the &#34;w&#34;. Anyone familliar
  with this font? <BR>
