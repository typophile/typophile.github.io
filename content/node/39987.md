  (a scan of a sweatshirt).  I've found lots of similar fonts, but nothing quite right.
  \ I suspect that the \"r\" alternates may have been hand-drawn.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tarragon-font_5717.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  logo dates from around the early to mid-70s, I believe, so hopefully that helps!\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance ..."
