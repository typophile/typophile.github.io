  body: You&#39;ve spoken to a rep at FontShop? Seems to me that they are more than
    likely still going to work. You should simply license the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&amp;font_categories=1&amp;font_categories_search=font_name_search&amp;searchstr=meta"
    target="_blank">current version</a> and make it work.

  body: 'Tiffany does this mean that ff meta directly translates into metaplus. I
    have 40 pages of artwork as part of a 64 page book and it is in the following:
    <BR> <BR>metaplusbold-roman <BR>metaplusbook-roman <BR>metaplusmedium-italic <BR>Raceregular
    <BR> <BR>Jeff thank you for the offer but I need these up and running in a few
    days'

  body: Neil,  <BR> <BR>Call Jeff or send him a private message through his name here
    on typophile. I would think that as FontShop did updates to Meta over the years
    that they simply removed the &#34;plus&#34; from the name. I wish I could tell
    you that it did replace perfectly, but I am not equipped with the necessary typefaces.

    FF MetaPlus back to FF Meta. Give me a minute.

  body: Tiffany thank you and Yves as well. <BR>It turns out that my printer has the
    Meta family, so no need to purchase it and problem solved. <BR>Thanks too to David
    Robb and Veronica Hamer for responding to emails.
