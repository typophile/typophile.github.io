So I’d really appreciate your suggestions and hear about your experiences. The thing should offer everything a graphic designer would expect (color calibration ...) of course. Flatscreen is probably the way to go.

		<div class="commentbody">Swissmiss asked this question a little while ago and got a ton of replies, though a good few blindly shouted "Apple!" even though their displays are, quite frankly, weak: the display in my brand new Santa Rosa MacBook is awful – it's a Samsung panel LTN133W1, made in the 1st quarter of 2006, and exhibits the "dithering" that so many people have complained about – and the Cinema Displays really, really need updating. I reckon Apple will announce new models in January, along with new Mac Pros and the mythical thin MBP. Anyway, here's the post:
http://swissmiss.typepad.com/weblog/2007/11/advice-from-my-.html

Personally, I'd hit "cheap but big with decent performance" option and go for the Dell 2707WFP (single-DVI connection) when it's on discount, along with a third-party calibrator, as I said in the link above. I'm still a little amazed that I'm the only one that mentioned hardware calibration in that thread, all displays tend to be mediocre without profiling. I'm willing to live with the trade-off of poorer performance of LCDs vs. CRTs in exchange for the larger display size, and the extra desk space is quite welcome, too. SED does sound promising, though If you need something now there aren't any displays available using that technology.

By far the most thorough review of the Dell I've found online has been at Anandtech; it's a real shame they don't review displays more often:
http://www.anandtech.com/printarticle.aspx?i=2961

That review should give an idea of the competition, too, though it's 6 months old so there'll probably be newer models about.

It is very difficult to buy a good CRT these days - Barco, Sony, LaCie all quit making them.

BTW: I have an Apple 23-inch Cinema Display. It has the famous magenta cast, but I am not bothered by that — being old school I KNOW what cmyk-values a skintone has. ; )

The magenta cast was on the earlier versions and has been corrected for a long time.

I am no Apple fan per se - but their LCDs have served me well.

I will second the Dell -- not that I really have a lot of data by which to judge. I recently had to order myself a new display at work, and our hardware standards offer Dell and Apple. I am a die-hard Apple guy, but I compared the specs and, for the same size/pixels, the Dell wins. Better specs, better price, better warranty. (I was reading about high failure rates with the Apples.) And the Dell (2407WFP-HC) easily spins to portait (vertical), if that's your cup of tea.</div>

So for native resolution you've could go for the Dell 27", the Apple 24" or the Eizo CG241W. For more than that (i.e. the 30" models) you'll need dual-link DVI.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">So, I finally got my Dell 2208WFP Ultrasharp 22" display.

What kinda annoys me is that the lightness of the screen seems uneven.
There’s a gradient from darker (top) to lighter (bottom).
If I turn the display 90 degrees the gradient will go from right to left (so it’s not a viewing angle or environmental lighting thing).
Is that normal? Or is the thing bad and I need a replacement?
Anybody experienced something like that? Is it a known problem?

Most important: DON’T BUY THE DELL 2208WFP!!!
It doesn’t have anything in common with the 2007WFP that has been praised as an adequate substitute for the Apple displays.
It has a much cheaper (and less quality) panel technology built into it (TN) whereas the old ones had S-IPS panels.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">These are supposed to be really good Sharon, with the caveat that they are wide gamut. I think they are up to 92% or so of aRGB which means they display a lot more colors you can't print and a much wider gamut than almost anyone viewing your webpages would. Most monitors are somewhere around sRGB, which is why that is the standard color profile for web work. It is also a lot closer to the print gamut. So people are struggling a little bit with these wide gamut monitors, seeing changes in what they see on screen and what is printed or on the web. Especially the reds for this NEC in particular, making skin tones particularly elusive.

Wide gamut is the future and I'm sure we'll adjust…
