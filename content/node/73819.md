  and im secretly hoping that in the meantime, someone has digitized this or at least
  has a good scan from this typeface.\r\nIt appears in the rookledge book and in the
  mekanorma catalogue.\r\nAnyone can tell me where to buy this/get this or willing
  to share a good scan with me?\r\nWould be much appreciated!\r\n"
