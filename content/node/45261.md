  Printing on the Vandercook Press\u201D \r\n\r\nIn this class conducted in the Cooper
  Union letterpress studio students will learn the basics of printing in letterpress.
  You will learn how to set type using wood and metal typefaces and how to print your
  work on the studio\u2019s Vandercook presses. This will be a hands-on class that
  will suit those who love design and typography but need a reprieve from the computer
  screen. This course will be an in-depth experience in letterpress for those interested
  in taking things beyond basic hand-set type composition. We will explore ways that
  images, foil stamping, die cuts, scoring and perforation can be incorporated in
  your designs to achieve great effects. During class the students will have time
  to work on projects of their own using the studio facilities (primarily the Vandercook
  presses) and to troubleshoot problems encountered with the assistance of the instructor.
  There is no pre-requisite for this course, but a familiarity with basic type terminology
  will be beneficial.\r\n\r\nPlease visit www.cooper.edu/ce for more information.\r\n\r\nWednesday,
  6:30 PM - 9:30 PM; 9 sessions starting June 4, 2008, ending July 30, 2008 \r\nCost
  $290 + $25 registration fee = $315\r\nInstructor: Daniel Morris \r\nDaniel Morris
  runs The Arm, a contemporary gallery, performance space and public access letterpress
  studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He has produced letterpress projects with such
  artists as NYC punk band Japanther, Berlin conceptual artist Matthias Wermke, and
  Philadelphia hip hop act Spank Rock. For more information see www.thearmnyc.com.\r\n"
