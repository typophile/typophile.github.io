    like with all the ball terminals removed to match C, S, G.

  body: 'Hi Graham. <BR> <BR>I assume some of the unorthodoxy you are metioning is
    the absence of certain ball terminals. Some unorthodoxy is good. I think you&#39;ve
    got some other issues though, mainly stroke modulation and color issues. <BR>
    <BR>Caps: <BR>Seems like all of the thicks in your round letters could be thicker
    &#40;they are all light&#41; In the first line, check the CO vs the INRP etc.
    <BR> <BR>Your bracketed serifs are making dark spots. Thin them out a bit. Check
    the Z vs the Y <BR> <BR>G needs weight on the right side. <BR> <BR>LowerCase:
    <BR>Again, rounds need more weight. Check out how dark the stem of the p is vs
    the round. Check all the rounds pqdbaeg etc. <BR> <BR>t: The weight gets too light
    too early as you move into the tail. <BR> <BR>g: Needs weight in the tail.  <BR>
    <BR>Overall. It&#39;s ok if you don&#39;t want the ball terminals, but it leaves
    you with a problem. The ends of your letters are really weak. For example the
    sS should be as dark as the other letters. They aren&#39;t though. I suppose you
    could really thicken up the spine and leave off the terminals, but that&#39;s
    why they were put there in the first place. I guess what I&#39;m getting at is:
    You must solve that problem. Maybe in an unorthodox way'

  body: 'This is looking much more polished, although it&#39;s been &#34;tamed&#34;
    as well. It&#39;s like a calm, neutral serif face - uncommon. It feels like something
    in the spirit of Bookman, with an affinity for journalism. <BR> <BR>The glyphs
    that stand out: <BR>- &#34;J&#34;: needs a full curl. <BR>- &#34;g&#34;: needs
    to be more rigid. <BR>- &#34;&amp;&#34;: very cool, but out of character. <BR>-
    &#34;7&#34;: very nice. <BR> <BR>Also, you need to decide if this is a text face
    or a display face. For the former I&#39;d make it a bit darker and lengthen the
    ascenders; for the latter it&#39;s fine as it is. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Excellent suggestions from Hrant. I really enjoy the &#39;g&#39;, but <BR>he&#39;s
    right - it&#39;s not for this face. <BR> <BR>No proper quotes? The comma sets
    a good shape. <BR>Your lc &#39;s&#39; is upside-down. <BR> <BR>Keep it as display
    type. There is room for headline serifs.

  body: Quotes look good. You still need a standard ampersand. <BR>I think what Hrant

    target="_blank">Primer&#39;s &#39;s&#39;</a> too. Yours looks wrong because <BR>it&#39;s
    too top-heavy. Try shortening the top stroke so it doesn&#39;t <BR>extend to the
    width of the belly. Good &#39;g&#39;.

  body: 'The &#34;J&#34; is better, but I&#39;d make it narrower, and it does need
    some kind of terminal. A ball terminal &#40;like in Primer&#41; is one option,
    and for that I&#39;d look at your &#34;f&#34; - although that&#39;s more of a
    &#34;teardrop&#34; terminal&#42;. You could also try a serif &#40;like in your
    &#34;S&#34;&#41; for a terminal. <BR> <BR>&#42; Now I&#39;m thinking maybe your
    &#34;f&#34; needs a ball terminal instead. <BR> <BR>The ampersand in your main
    character set is OK to me. <BR> <BR>The new &#34;g&#34; is almost there: it just
    needs to move the stroke weight in its tail to either the bottom or -more unconventionally-
    to the right. &#40;And I&#39;d avoid the common practice of putting weight in
    the horizontal part of the join.&#41; <BR> <BR>The eszet seems too dynamic - try
    making that curvy part less curvy. <BR>And to me a texty eszet benefits from an
    abrupt shift where the top curve starts going in. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I liked the first one better. Of course there are some rough  <BR>edges, but
    it has an original spirit. I think some of the  <BR>coolest stuff comes from people
    who are trying to figure  <BR>out what letters are &#39;supposed&#39; to look
    like. Once they figure  <BR>it out, it looks like everything else. I think that&#39;s
    what  <BR>happened here. I think the super short serifs and miniature  <BR>ball
    terminals are great. However, I agree that the terminals  <BR>on C and the S from
    the first version need something.

  body: Thanx for the remarks, and the first version is still there on my system.
    I will fix that one up as is sometime. I do agree with your view that this constant
    change to suit others opinions ends up &#40;sometimes&#41; changing a font too
    much. The idea that someone has can end up being blanded out of existance. Yes
    it is nice to have a good looking font, but you do need to retain the originality.
    This fonts changes, and suggestions, have so far been helpful, and in no way &#39;bland&#39;
    it out. <BR> <BR>That said The attached is some of the changes made &#40;and I
    am happy to make these changes, as the suggestions have been helpful&#41; <BR><img
