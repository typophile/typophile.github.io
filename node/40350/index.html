  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>My communication design course at art university wants every student to create a booklet which is supposed to accompany an ad campaign for a chosen subject. Each and everyone of us needs to present our work early next year.</p>
<p>I have NO idea for an effective ad campaign (newspapers) yet&hellip; ;-) However&hellip; I thought - why not start with my booklet then, as I did some profound research concerning my topic.</p>
<p>I like the typefaces which were created for the relaunch of the UKs daily &ldquo;The Guardian&rdquo; a lot. I would have loved to choose them for lead-ins and headlines in my presentation as well. Another typeface I love (and which was also awarded by the TDC) is &ldquo;Greta&rdquo;. However, due to Christmas and other heavy expenses and my life as a poor design student, ;-) I had to settle for Lucida Std which I found on my Mac and thought of it as a good alternative for headlines and bigger sized lead-ins&hellip;</p>
<p>I think about combining it with one of the following typefaces (for continuous text):
Bliss Pro, Vista Sans or Dax&hellip; I&rsquo;ve attached a screen shot of those three, with Vista Sans being my favorite at the moment, for the simple reason that I feel it might be more readable (in small print) although it&rsquo;s &ldquo;f&rdquo; and &ldquo;l&rdquo; collide for example.</p>
<p>What do you think - I feel the two typefaces might go well together, I&rsquo;m no type specialist, so I might be completely wrong as well - that&rsquo;s why I ask you guys :-)</p>
<p>Thanks a lot &amp; happy new year,
Jan</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not so much a collision. It&rsquo;s a [[ligature]]. You can turn it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->off<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if you don&rsquo;t like the effect.</p>
