    my finger on it either.

  body: "<cite>Monotype.com</cite> is what early versions of Andale Mono licensed
    to Microsoft used to be called. There is no difference between the two.\r\n\r\nThe
    latest version of Monotype.com that I have is 1.20, last modified in April 1998.
    The latest version of Andale Mono that I have is 2.00, last modified in November
    1998. Both are OpenType fonts containing 659 glyphs over five Unicode ranges and
    21 code pages."

  body: Knap, I had done a perfunctory Google search for the font, which was not successful...
    Spire, I thought that Monotype.com was a proportional design, unlike Andale's
    tabular/monospace nature. I could well be wrong. Perhaps someone from Monotype
    is lurking and can put us out of our (collective) misery.

    it is identical to Andale Mono.

  body: "As background on the Monotype.com back to Andale switch, the Web fonts were
    beginning to be merged into Windows, and the program manager thought that using
    the Monotype.com name wasn't appropriate, there were also concerns about referencing
    a font name with a '.' in computer code. We did have the period and slash changed
    at some point, not sure if this was before, after, or coincidental with the name
    change.   \r\n\r\nSi\r\n\r\nedit - should have been \"space and slash\" not \"period
    and slash\""

    both identical to the ones in the current version of Andale Mono.
