  eagle on The Great Seal of the United States on the back of a one dollar bill. Anyone
  know where I can get a vector halftone dot pattern like this... preferably for free,
  if possible? Here are some examples of what I'm looking for:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20Government/Federal%20Reserve%20Scam/Eagle.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tobi.com/color_image/men_side_image/11795\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain,
  I need a scalable vector of the halftone dot pattern, not the actual Great Seal.
  Thanks.\r\n\r\n"

    could get a similar look if you had two parallel lines, ones ticker than the other
    in Adobe illustrator then use the blend tool to set 'specific steps' between the
    two strokes. Then repeat the process on a different angle. \r\n\r\nI hope this
    helps."
