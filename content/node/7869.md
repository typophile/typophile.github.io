  the place to come. <BR> <BR>Some of you will have heard of the Building Letters
  magazine which I am involved in, for those of you not aware of it, it is an annual
  publication, which includes a magazine, a CD of typefaces and a couple of posters,
  it is sold to raise money for charity projects. <BR> <BR>You can find out more info
  here : <a href="http://www.buildingletters.org" target="_blank">http://www.buildingletters.org</a>
  <BR> <BR>Anyway, the India issue has been out for about a month, and the response
  has been terrible. We have sold only about 80 copies, which doesn&#39;t give us
  much to donate to the charities we want to support, so I wondered if I could get
  some feedback on where I might be going wrong, the content, the price, the fonts
  or the way that the pack is sold? <BR> <BR>I really want to make this project work,
  so your feedback would be most useful. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>==='

  body: Jim, I&#39;ve been emailing you for a while, asking about this, and the publication
    date, and have received nothing back. The Building letters site said that issue
    2 was coming soon a very long time ago &#40;like newlyn.com:-&#41;and I gave up
    checking. <BR>I&#39;ve seen nothing about issue 2 on any design portal etc. <BR>I
    think it really needs a HEAVY promotional push, lots of press releases to all
    the design websites and magazines. I&#39;ve put a link to the site on newlyn.com.

  body: Jim, I&#39;m afraid that I have to agree with Miles. The only place that I&#39;ve
    ever heard about Building Letters from was in an e-mail conversation with you.
    You need a mass marketing push, with repeat buzzes on every design site &#40;and
    for type, that means not just Typophile, but Typographica, the ATypI website,
    Typo-L, even the big type foundry websites

    to buy one, but am too poor at the moment, because of funny German laws. If you
    come to TypoTechnica and sell them there &#40;please do think about coming to
    TypoTechnica and selling them there&#41;, I promise that I will buy one. I&#39;ll
    have more money then.

    living in the U.S., the price is reasonable, but out of my &#34;impulse buy&#34;

    I get my year-end bonus, or have my wife buy it for me for Xmas. <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW,

    and complete ecommerce system. The simple form you have on the site doesn&#39;t
    seem secure. Just a thought, you may want to upgrade. <BR> <BR>Matt

    sell any magazine issues at all in our industry. I don&#39;t think that the excellently
    produced Spatium sells all that well, either. Jim, have you tried selling through
    bookstores? Nijhoff &amp; Lee in Amsterdam carries Spatium, for instance. And
    maybe the new House 33 store from House Industries in London would sell your magazine

    look at the big picture. This is a good cause. We are all fortunate enough to
    have the luxury of nitpicking over serifs and boumas. Most people in the world
    don&#39;t have the terrible burden of the quest for the typographic grail of letterform
    perfection. If you are going to TypoTechnica, you are not likely to starve to
    death anytime soon. For those on this site with the means to help out, I think
    Jim&#39;s project is a worthy cause.

    - If you order a copy of Building Letters and put typophile after your name &#40;so

    magazine &#40;sorry all the font disks have gone&#41;. Only about 300 were sold,

    print shops. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.buildingletters.org" target="_blank">http://www.buildingletters.org</a>

    <BR> <BR>I think interesting fonts for a low price will pull in designers. You
    might want to think about the &#39;what you get&#39; more than the &#39;what it
    does&#39;. Good or bad, I think the fonts and posters are the draw, and the charity
    is the bonus when it comes to designers. We tend to be a socially conscious &#40;if
    not socially active&#41; bunch, so that works in your favor. <BR> <BR>Well, regardless,
    you got me too! The magazine looks fascinating, and the fonts look great. I just
    ordered a copy a few minutes ago. &#40;However, I didn&#39;t see your little Typophile
