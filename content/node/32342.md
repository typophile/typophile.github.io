  Germany 1893).  I'm interested in the odd \"left-angle\"\r\nbetween the A and t
  which is a binary infix operator with a \r\nlogical meaning.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is
  a surd stroke rotated 90 degrees clockwise, or \r\nam I mistaken? "

  body: "Like Nick, I similarly enjoy your posts, and I don't quite know what that
    symbol is. My first thought was a square root sign rotated 90 degrees to the right.
    If that's the same as a \"surd stroke,\" then nothing new here.\r\n\r\nOn second
    thought, maybe it's a virgule slash flipped horizontally (EDIT: with an extra,
    bolder stroke added)."
