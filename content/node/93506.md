  fonts. Right now I\u2019m trying to get the vertical metrics right and for some
  reason beyond my grasp some of them won\u2019t get right, no matter what I try.\r\n\r\nBelow
  are a roman and an italic version of the same typeface, with identical vertical
  metrics and identical specs in Indesign. Still, they won\u2019t line up.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
  read and read over again the wonderful article on vertical metrics by John Hudson
  here on Typophile (thank you John) and religiously followed his guidings and guess
  what, they work wonderfully. Except for this pair. Anyone any idea what I\u2019m
  doing wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlex\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schermafbeelding_5095.png]"

  body: "Jason, the distances in the image seems to be a bit much to blame to hinting
    ... Hinting should be rounding individual <em>pixels</em> up or down, <em>non</em>?\r\n\r\nAlex
    may need to confirm that his\r\n<blockquote>identical vertical metrics</blockquote>\r\nare
    indeed correct. It might be something as small as a different line gap value."

  body: "More and more I\u2019m inclined to think the problem lies within InDesign.
    I still don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on, but when generating PFD\u2019s
    from InDesign I sometimes get mixed results. When viewing the same fonts in let\u2019s
    say Linotype FontExplorer there seems to be no lining problem."

  body: "All the Adobe apps use an custom Adobe-built rasterizer to display type etc.
    instead of the rasterizer of the system (OS X, Windows, etc). What you noticed
    could be typical for that and might be a bug that needs reporting and fixing.
    You should try and file a bug report at Adobe\u2019s site\u2026"
