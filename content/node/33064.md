  type designers with the hope of making a Web site and publishing a series of books
  on the subject. Although I've acquired several hundred stamps by the following thirteen
  designers, I'm certain I must be missing someone. Is anyone aware of additional
  type designers who have designed postage stamps?\r\n\r\nNeville Brody\r\nWalter

    designed some \u203Areal\u2039 stamps."

    collection of Eric Gill's drawings for stamps, coins, and paper currency. There
    were many lovely things\u2014much better than the one stamp in which he did play
    a direct role.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EricGill_6205.jpg] \r\n\r\nMany
    thanks for the other references for Dutch and Swiss stamps. I've already started
    cataloguing the stamps by these new designers."

      stamps\u2014but the catalogue is from 1999, and he certainly could have worked
      on something for another country. I'll see what I can find. Many thanks.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    be the case, but years ago in the Portland (Maine) Museum of Art, there was a
    display showing some Winslow Homer pencil sketches of the Civil War, and the resulting
    engravings that appeared in <em>Harper's Weekly.</em> Homer is a \xABfavorite
    son\xBB in Maine, so one can appreciate his being made much of, and the Museum
    owns a number of his works. However, that does not excuse the fact that there
    was <em><strong>no</em></strong> mention whatsoever of the unsung engraver, the
    process of translation from pencil sketch to printing block, and so forth. A lost
    opportunity for taeching people something. End of rant."

    second Jackie: Where do you draw the line? I mean, before digital typesetting
    and the possibility of using fonts, every tiny lettering on a stamp was kind of
    a type design, no?\r\nSo, I assume you\u2019re focussing on <strong>font</strong>
    designers (i.e. not lettering artists/engraving legends \u203Aonly\u2039)? Then,
    Gerrit Noordzij could count himself lucky, at least having done Ruse \u2026 ;)"
