  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>EDIT: because there is not a lot of information about how to create a flipper font, below is a step-to-step guide for FontLab. I hope people with no background knowledge, and with the same questions as me can find some answers. My original message and questions about a flipper font are shown below.</p>
<p>A flipper font is a font that has multiple variations of every character. These variations are alternately called upon to bring more variations inside the font. Example:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1-Same_glyph_4820.jpg]</p>
<p>this is the default behaviour, on the keyboard the ‘n’ is ticked, and the same &lsquo;n&rsquo; is used again and again.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2-Changing_glyphs_4607.jpg]</p>
<p>On a flipper font however, when the key ‘n’ is pressed, there are variations on every glyph used, in this case, there are 10 variations on each character. When the 10th variation is used, it starts again with variation 1 etc.</p>
<p>———
How to create this in FontLab? The steps below are guidelines, as I find them the most easy way to do it. There are other possibilities and an other order is possible.</p>
<p>First, in FontLab, design every character that is already there, and set its width etc.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3-Default_Window_3677.png]</p>
<p>Next steps are creating the variations on every character. Do so by going to menu Glyph -&gt; Generate glyphs. Type there: ‘n.alt2 n.alt3 n.alt4 n.alt5 n.alt6 n.alt7 n.alt8 n.alt9 n.alt10’. This will create nine other versions of the character ‘n’. For creating variations for the other characters, replace the n with the other character name; example ‘A.alt2 A.alt3 A.alt4 A.alt5 A.alt6 A.alt7 A.alt8 A.alt9 A.alt10’ do so with every character.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4-Generate_glyphs_5988.png]</p>
<p>Note that the already designed basic-character is copied. I myself find that easy to work further on. Design each glyph as preferred. Make enough differences between every version of a character, otherwise a flipper font has no meaning.</p>
<p>For the coding part, open the panel in menu -&gt; panels -&gt; OpenType. There happens the OpenType code. The most basic code that can be used is:</p>
<p>press the ‘+’ button left below, and replace the appearing code by
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->feature aalt{
feature calt;
} aalt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Aalt does mean ‘Access All Alternates’, and the list of features that follows are the special features that are used in this font. Here it is only calt (Contextual Alternates), which is used to get a flipper font working. A list of OpenType features can be found here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType_feature_tag_list#OpenType_Typographic_Features">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType_feature_tag_list#OpenType_Typographic_Features</a>
Press the ‘+’ again, and replace the new code with:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->feature calt { # contextual Alternates 
sub n n' by n.alt2;
sub n.alt2 n' by n.alt3;
sub n.alt3 n' by n.alt4;
sub n.alt4 n' by n.alt5;
sub n.alt5 n' by n.alt6;
sub n.alt6 n' by n.alt7;
sub n.alt7 n' by n.alt8;
sub n.alt8 n' by n.alt9;
sub n.alt9 n' by n.alt10;
sub n.alt10 n' by n;
} calt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5-OpenType_code1_6001.png]</p>
<p>With this code, the ‘n’ starts to vary according to its position. Never there will be two times the same ‘n’ after each other, as in image 2. Note: everything after a ‘#’ is a reminder; it does nothing with the code, but it makes it easier to ad a note, and to understand what the code is doing. 
This is the start of a flipper font. But doing this code for every character again is a lot of work. For making that easier there are classes.</p>
<p>The classes panel can be found at menu Window-&gt;Panels-&gt;Classes.
Classes are used to group glyphs of the same sort. The basic-characters are one class, the first variations (alternate 2 as I called them) are the next class, the second variation is class 3, etc.</p>
<p>Create 10 classes on the left side of the panel.
I myself prefer to give long names to classes. That way, in an comprehensive OpenType Font, with a lot of features and a long list of different names, it is easy to see what a class is, and what it does. My names are build as Class_calt, Class_alt2, Class_alt3,… means: it is a class, and it contains alternates version X of the characters. And I let the numbering start with the first class, to have a structure.
Drag and drop the glyphs in the right class; the result should be as next:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Class_calt    -all the normal glyphs
Class_alt2    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt2
Class_alt3    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt3
Class_alt4    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt4
Class_alt5    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt5
Class_alt6    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt6
Class_alt7    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt7
Class_alt8    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt8
Class_alt9    -all the glyphs with suffix .alt9
Class_alt10  -all the glyphs with suffix .alt10<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/6-Classes_5519.png]</p>
<p>Now this work is done, the code in the OpenType panel has to be changed.</p>
<p>Replace our previous code:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->feature calt { # contextual Alternates 
sub n n' by n.alt2;
sub n.alt2 n' by n.alt3;
sub n.alt3 n' by n.alt4;
sub n.alt4 n' by n.alt5;
sub n.alt5 n' by n.alt6;
sub n.alt6 n' by n.alt7;
sub n.alt7 n' by n.alt8;
sub n.alt8 n' by n.alt9;
sub n.alt9 n' by n.alt10;
sub n.alt10 n' by n;
} calt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>with next code:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->feature calt { # contextual Alternates 
sub @class_calt @class_calt' by @class_alt2;
sub @class_alt2 @class_calt' by @class_alt3;
sub @class_alt3 @class_calt' by @class_alt4;
sub @class_alt4 @class_calt' by @class_alt5;
sub @class_alt5 @class_calt' by @class_alt6;
sub @class_alt6 @class_calt' by @class_alt7;
sub @class_alt7 @class_calt' by @class_alt8;
sub @class_alt8 @class_calt' by @class_alt9;
sub @class_alt9 @class_calt' by @class_alt10;
sub @class_alt10 @class_calt' by @class_calt;
} calt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So in stead of working with each individual character, the code is looking into the classes. That saves writing some thousand lines of code. This new code with the classes makes the flipping character-independent. Not only if two times the same character follows at each other, as in the example with the &lsquo;n&rsquo;, but with every new character the font will take a contextual alternate.</p>
<p>Generate the font as OpenType, so the code is also exported.
Currently most professional programs are compatible with this sort of type.
Test it. It is easy to overlook a mistake.</p>

<p>ORIGINAL MESSAGE:
The context of this question is one of my experiments
to create a good legible font (NOT such a comic font) that is very readable on little formats.
To simulate a sense of  handwriting, it has to be a flipper font.
I want to look if it is possible to combine, and how far it is possible to go with.</p>
<p>I thought I was smart enough to figure out how it had to be done in FontLab
but thanks to my limited knowledge of the English language, I&rsquo;m not.
Also I have only a limited knowledge of FontLab, my previous fonts were without programming Python.
(I actually know FontLab only one year now, and on school the specialization Typography is in its childhood,
not a lot of people know FontLab in detail)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in this part of fonts, but it would be stupid having to learn Python for one exercise,
I can better learn it later when I have more time.
So my question is; can someone link to, or provide a step by step way how to create flipper fonts in FontLab?
Starting with how to create multiple versions of one glyph (and the correct name it has to be given)
over how to write and insert the Python code,
and if needed, how to export it the correct way.</p>
<p>I have found the code, but don&rsquo;t know how to implement it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
feature salt {
lookup rotate {
sub @set_1 @set_1' by @set_2;
sub @set_2 @set_1' by @set_3;
sub @set_3 @set_1' by @set_4;
sub @set_4 @set_1' by @set_5;
sub @set_5 @set_1' by @set_1;
} rotate;
lookup rotate;
} salt;
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I have done a search around, but couldn&rsquo;t find something easy;
<a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/19625">http://www.typophile.com/node/19625</a>
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/43634">http://typophile.com/node/43634</a>
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/13315">http://typophile.com/node/13315</a>
Even Google didn&rsquo;t give an easy answer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry my first post has to be such an stupid easy thing, but so it be.
I think Typophile is the best place to ask this,
here I have found already a lot of information about font designing problems in the past.
I&rsquo;m glad if someone could tell me.

The OpenType version of Fontesque, for instance.
Then you could could look at the glyph names, classes, and “calt” code, and see how it works in the OpenType Preview panel.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ JamesM: A flipper font is a font with every character multiple times, with in every version of that character (little) differences. This is done so there is more variation in the text.
The program is detecting that a character is used, and then uses the next version, and then the version thereafter till they are all used. Then it starts again.</p>
<p>@ Nick Shinn: thanks for the reply.
However, flipper fonts are not freeware (I didn&rsquo;t find one). Otherwise I had done it that way.
For this very little schoolproject, I&rsquo;m not gona buy it (nor steal nor ask to give one illegal)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping I have it in some days, with some help from somebody.
When we get the code to work, I will post the steps here.</p>

A lot of little pieces of information made the whole.</p>
<p>The only question that remains is:
now glyphs only flip if they are next to each other.
It should also do so when they are not to each other; so that every alternate has passed before it takes the first again. Where should I search for that?</p>

<p>The concept is very interesting. I was wondering if this has any application in Arabic Fonts as well.</p>
