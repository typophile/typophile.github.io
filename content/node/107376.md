  body: "As mentioned, the name is hand lettered.\r\nThe the initial T is similar
    to the T in a font released by Barnhart Bros. and Spindler as Faust Text in 1898,
    and later sold as Missal Text. \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/faust-text/\r\nThe
    rest of the word is derived from a font produced in 1760 as Caslon Black and now
    usually known as Old English. Too complex for most hand lettering, but there are
    simplified versions such as this house letters\r\ndesign:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OldEnglishHouseLettersSM_3428.jpg]\r\nDon"
