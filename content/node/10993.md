  body: It might be Matthew Carter&#39;s fat face Elephant, but I don&#39;t have any
    samples handy to check.

  body: John <BR> <BR>I think this is Elephant. A bit tricked out though. The E is
    foreshortened on the horizontal in both sizes. That &#34;clever&#34; MP kern-in
    is a bit jarring.

  body: Gerald, John -- <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think this is Elephant &#40;unless Matthew
    reworked  <BR>it before releasing it as Big Figgins -- which I doubt&#41;.  <BR>The
    Elephant/Big Figgins &#39;C&#39; doesn&#39;t have a bottom  <BR>serif, the bracketing
    at the end of thins on &#39;M&#39; and &#39;N&#39; is  <BR>less than this sample,
    the serifs on horizontals of &#39;E&#39;  <BR>and &#39;L&#39; are heavier than
    this, and the beaks on &#39;C&#39; &#39;G&#39; &#39;S&#39;  <BR>are scooped more
    deeply on the outside transitions. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>

  body: None of the fat modern serifs I could find have this bottom serif on the UC
    &#34;C&#34;. Some Bodonis have it, but even in the boldest weights those&#39;re
    not fat enough. :/

    place which one.

    on the serifs, but still...
