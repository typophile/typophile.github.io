  binder filled with a lot of financial info as well as photographs and architectural
  renderings of our stores. <BR> <BR>We are using Neutraface as the display face,
  but I want to use a serif that complements Neutraface and is legible, hopefully
  making long financial pages less dull. <BR> <BR>Suggestions?

  body: Neutraface has those tall, spindly ascenders, which makes it a little hard
    to match. I&#39;d suggest an antiqua like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/koch-antiqua/">Koch
    Antiqua</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/eva-sg/">Eva
    SG</a>, but those are too overtly calligraphic and achieve much of their effects
    through low x-height rather than tall ascenders. Also, it&#39;s too spindly for
    use as a text setting. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/filosofia/">Filosofia</a>
    has a similar amount of personality as Neutraface, and is roughly the same age.

    Neutra is so tough to match you are better off finding another serif that is more
    old style than not. I&#39;d also suggest, if you are going to use all caps, either
    use small caps instead with some letterspacing or at least all caps with some
    letterspacing maybe 2 pts less than you think you should.  <BR> <BR>Just suggestions.

  body: Thanks Tiffany, <BR> <BR>I found it about a minute after posting my question.
    <BR> <BR>Okay, another Neutraface related question. The project I&#39;m working
    on also requires that keywords be die-cut into polyethelene dividers that will
    be in the binder. So that requires a stencil be created for certain letters. Here
    is a rough draft of what I have come up with. I&#39;ll fine tune the stencils
    later. I sure hope Christian Schwartz never sees this <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/67618.jpg"
    alt="neutra diecut"> <BR> <BR>Are the stencils positioned okay? I&#39;m particularly
    concerened with the R.

  body: I think your placements need to be a little more assymetrical. The R seems
    right to me, but the A and the O seem too centered.
