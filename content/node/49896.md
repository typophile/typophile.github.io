  Stage]] theater in D.C. has been featured in design annuals for several years. The
  same typeface used in the Arena Restaged logo (I believe) is used in this logo for
  Invitrogen, a biotech company.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me ID this font?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arena-restaged_6350.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/invitrogen_4790.jpg]"
