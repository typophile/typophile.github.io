  body: Overall, I think your layout is good, nice and clean. I would probably move
    the page numbers down to the lower right hand corner (for right hand pages, left
    corner for left pages), or maybe put them up above, with the page title? That
    would give you a bit more room at the bottom of the page. I think some "fresher"
    type choices would help a lot. Are you using Futura and Times? I did notice that
    the Futura you used is not a true small caps (don't know if there's a Futura that
    has true small caps...) So, that is one thing that looks odd to me, because the
    "small cap" characters are thinner. I think there are a number of other people
    that have asked for type suggestions for their thesis, just do a search and you'll
    find some good options...

    body: "One of the problems is the very specific guidelines that are laid down
      for the layout.  There must be a 40mm margin at the bottom of the page, so that
      space looks very odd if the page number isn't there.  I've tried moving the
      page number to the bottom-right, but I feel that it looks unbalanced - pages
      must be printed right-side only, and there are no left pages to balance it out.\r\n\r\nIt's
      actually Avante Garde Demi, not Futura.  You're right though, the small caps
      do look a bit odd now you mention it.  I'll try to either find a typeface with
      true small caps or use normal text.  Getting typefaces (other than the default)
      to work in LaTeX is not an easy task though, hence the use of Times (as opposed
      to Computer Modern).  If you do happen to have any suggestions for typefaces
      for body text in a technical document then let me know."

  body: "There lies much work in customizing a LaTeX document to that extent. One
    question, though: Why are the headers so far to the right \u2013 why not stick
    to the margin of the main text? Perhaps they would also look clearer if they wouldn't
    be using CAPS. I think the fancyhdr package or something similar offers options
    for that.\r\nRegarding the page number issue: an empty page on the left side when
    the thesis is printed and bound may also balance a non-centered pagemark.\r\nThe
    overall appearance is clear and much better than average layouts for academic
    stuff I have seen so far. Good luck! "

  body: "Still better! Converting and preparing fonts for use with LaTeX is not the
    easiest thing to do, although you could use fontinst from the command line (depending
    on your TeX distribution). The crucial point in using correct small caps are the
    .map and .fd files for the fonts you are using. But the Avantgarde Demi that is
    published with teTeX does not have proper small caps (see adobe.map somewhere
    in your TeX tree). So probably it's best to stick to the current status. \r\nOne
    thing that I personally would reconsider is using a line under the header. Perhaps
    it would be enough to have the Header typeset in a different font style and size
    than the main text. Do you need the rule? Using the fancyhdr package that would
    be: <code>\\pagestyle{fancy}\r\n\\renewcommand{\\headrulewidth}{0pt}</code>\r\nAd
    hardcopy: Take a printout of your sample pages and stick it into a similar PhD
    thesis from the next university library to get an impression! ;)\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "Yes, I've now come to hate LaTeX and installing fonts.  It really does not
    seem the most intuitive thing for LaTeX non-experts like me.  I have tried several
    guides on how to convert a TTF file to use in LaTeX, but I get halfway through
    and then something doesn't work, or a file is not created or something else.  It
    seems that many of the guides (and the tools) were written many years ago, and
    are no longer applicable.  Another factor is that I don't have write access to
    the systemwide TeX tree (and haven't really got the time to figure out how to
    do a custom one and adapt the guides to install into it).  I would probably go
    mad if I were to persue it further...  Suffice it to say that I'm actually growing
    more fond of it in normal caps now.\r\n\r\nI'll experiment and try it without
    the header rule.  I actually added it because I preferred it with an older version
    that I had - Maybe things have changed now though after all the helpful advice

  body: "I think you're pretty much there. The only comment I have concerns your figures;
    specifically, the text on the figures. I'm not certain how they were created,
    but it appears that they may have been scaled to different degrees. For example,
    the caption \"occurrences\" in figure 6.2 is significantly smaller than the fonts
    in figure 6.4.\r\n\r\nFrom examining your pdf file, it looks like you're usiing
    a DVI-> PS-> PDF workflow, so I'll guess you're using .eps files for the figures.
    You might want to check out the PSfrag package, which allows you to easily replace
    the text in your figures with LaTeX-generated text. It's an easy way to make the
    fonts in the figures consistent with each other. You can find PSfrag <a href=http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/psfrag/>here</a>.\r\n\r\nSteven\r\n\r\n"

    to curves; it would mean re-saving all of the figures  with text included and
    then replacing them using PSFrag as you suggest -- all of which would take quite
    a while as there are about 60 figures in total.  I haven't quite got the sizes
    of the figures finalised yet anyway, but I will at least try to make them at a
    little more consistent when I go for the final version.\r\n\r\nJonathan"
