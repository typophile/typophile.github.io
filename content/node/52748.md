body: I created the following for my wine label over a year ago when I first got into
  the hobby.  However, I'm now to the point where I need to rework the image to include
  the type of wine on there as I've since diversified in what I produce and store.  However,
  I don't have the font I used for the label anymore and would like to stay consistent.  If
  anyone can help me identify the font, I would be much obliged.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/z98321296_6702.gif]

  body: I'd say this is a good opportunity to grab the felt-tip pen and recreated
    it so it's even better than the original.
