    kids, not coffeehouses. It looks like something a little girl would like on napkins
    and balloons for a birthday theme party.\r\n\r\nWhat a waste of creative opportunity.
    Do they plan to just keep zooming in until it's just a mermaid's nose? I bet there
    are some very frustrated designers in the wake of this wimpy \"change\". "

    carefully or they go wrong. They have a global logo classic, why mess with it?
    You can hear the marketing people telling them they have to change it if they
    want to to diversify and 'grow the brand' but in truth they risk cutting themselves
    off from their own heritage and thus their authenticity, which is the MOST important
    thing if they don't want to lose their way. It's a misunderstanding of how people
    percieve branding. No one reads the words every time they look at the logo, they
    see it as a whole, it simply does not matter if it says 'coffee' but now sells
    more than that. it's part of their history. It's reassuring.  Real stories about
    real companies are quirky and not neat. Thus they are human. They should not be
    ironed flat. They want to avoid corporate blandness but have no idea how to do
    that or how to cherish their own genuine individuality. The Starbucks cup is the
    definitive unit of their identity and it doesn't look so good anymore. A bit like
    a less desirable ripoff. it's a cock-eyed marketing decision, not a design one.
    They are mad.

    Why would they copy the green circle from an Italian newspaper, or, rather, why
    would an Italian newspaper in particular be taken as its source? (Later, I found
    an explanation for that logo with the Mercury head - it being of an espresso coffee
    chain founded by a former Starbucks manager that was absorbed into Starbucks when
    it finally relented and decided espresso was a good idea.)\r\n\r\nI have one Don
    Camillo novel I picked up in the (equivalent to a) remainder counter of a used
    book store. The author complained of the present generation, pursuing \"La Dolce
    Vita\", for whom the book was (most emphatically!) not written in a preface.\r\n\r\nThese
    are a series of comic novels about a small-town priest and his rivalry with the
    local Communist agitator. Thus, at one point, Don Camillo finds a statue of an
    obscure, possibly legendary saint, on the grounds of his church annoying and ugly,
    so he dumps it in the river one fine night; the Communist catches him at it, and
    so the next day, he rescues this statue of a saint from the river where, obviously,
    some terrible vandals had put it, and so he is hailed as a hero for being so generous
    to his natural opponents, the traditional Catholic Church... and the reader is
    given to understand, I suppose, that God used him to correct a spiritual problem
    Don Camillo was suffering from, thus leading this quiet priest further along the
    truly saintly life."

  body: "It isn't a bad logo. Or, perhaps more accurately, it <em>wasn't</em> a bad
    logo.\r\n\r\nOriginally, when Starbucks was one cafe in Seattle, a logo that looks
    like the sign outside, say, an English pub, was entirely appropriate - both to
    the business, and to the available budget for concerns such as branding.\r\n\r\nOver
    the years, I think they did an excellent job of modifying the logo so as to combine
    the two conflicting goals of having a brand symbol that has the elegance and stylishness
    befitting a major corporation - and a symbol with the quaintness and charm associated
    with a friendly neighborhood business devoted to quality.\r\n\r\nWhile the evolution
    has been away from (b) and towards (a), they've done an excellent job of keeping
    as much of (b) as possible while progressing towards (a).\r\n\r\nThat mermaid
    with stripes is, in its own way, a great work of art, holding emotions and symbolism
    in perfect balance. Compared to the Mona Lisa, she's been minimalistic since 1987
    and especially 1992, when the secondary circle motif was established."

    the update means I need no longer wonder if Starbucks is a beer.

  body: "I read all the arguments in favour of the change, and yet I am still puzzled
    by what exactly this update is meant to achieve. It changes the aesthetic feel
    of the logo (and through that of the brand and the company) dramatically. \r\n\r\nCurrent
    logo is enclosed, well-rounded and has an unmistakable personality (in part due
    to an unusual color scheme). It looks like something that you can get in a palm
    of your hand and it'd be a neat thing to toy with. Like an interesting coin, or
    a pebble. The rework has none of this. The black is gone, replaced by an over-abundance
    of rather unpleasant looking green. Gone is the feeling of being well rounded,
    replaced by a serrated edge. The melusine now <em>is</em> the logo, her weirdness
    is in your face, not counter-balanced or contained by other parts of the logo.\r\n\r\nHow
    hard was it to have both greens and blacks in the new logo? Or better yet - to
    add a simple stroke around it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/starbucks_6619.png]\r\n\r\n<code></code>\r\nRetains
    much of the existing feel, gets rid of the Coffee and makes shareholders happy-happy,
    bling-bling."

    line around the trademark in any event, when it is placed on store signage.\r\n\r\nI
    think that this option was likely considered, but rejected as a half-measure.
    Furthermore, the new trademark, as is, very strongly suggests a circular shape
    visually in any event.\r\n\r\nOf course, this particular change may not work very
    well with the crown floating on water version of the trademark used in Sa'udi
    Arabia: there, they probably should avoid changing the trademark."
