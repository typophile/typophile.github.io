  to do something special and thought I would do a wood carving of the Polish crest
  with their last name in Blackletter/Fraktur style lettering. However, I wanted to
  use a traditional Polish style lettering. Would anyone know if there is a font that
  fits this description?\r\n\r\nThank you very much."

    The medieval scripts  do not actually exist in the Polish visual tradition since
    the 17th century, being broadly associated with German culture. For Poles, Blackletter
    smells rather more like funeral than birthday. I would suggest handcut Aldines.\r\n\r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Wizerunek_zywota_czlowieka_poczciwego_Mikolaj_Rej_1567.jpg"

  body: "froo: Thank you very much for the information. Would you happen to know if
    there is a digitized version of that typeface and if so, where I could purchase
    it? If it isn't available, would it it still invoke thoughts of funerals if it
    were only the last name in Blackletter at the bottom of the family crest?\r\n\r\nJamesM:
    I am very aware of the rancor between these two very proud peoples. The father
    is of German descent with Welsh and possibly English and the mother is 100% Polish
    American. The Blackletter was my attempt at paying homage to the father's side
    of the family.\r\n\r\nI want to thank both of you very much for your insights.
    It is all very helpful.\r\n\r\nMark\r\n\r\n"

    is really fancy! I'd probably chose this one. They all look festive, yet have
    somehow modern form. All at myfonts.com.
