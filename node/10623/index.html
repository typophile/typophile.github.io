  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&#39;m working on my first set of true small caps.  I see that in a few fonts the small caps are a little taller than x-height, although theoretically they should be the same as the x-height.  Are there any guidelines for this?  I can see how it might be helpful if a font had a smallish x-height &#40;mine is average&#41;.  For my first version I made the stems of the small caps the same thickness as those of the lowercase letters, but I think this is not quite enough.  I&#39;d be grateful for any pointers on this topic. <BR> <BR>David</div>

The main reason is that some acronyms&#42; &#40;like &#34;OS&#34;, or &#34;SC&#34;!&#41; will look like lc if the smallcaps are as short as the x-height - throwing off the reader. <BR> <BR>&#42; Which is essentially the main use of smallcaps these days. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I did test printouts using Adobe Garamond Pro and Warnock Pro, which I happen to own and which contain true small caps; in both cases the small caps were as I describe, just slightly higher than x-height.  Palatino Linotype had the small caps the same as x-height.  I do not remember where I learned this principle about small caps, but it has been in my head for a while. <BR> <BR>I am speaking of small caps designed to go with traditional serif book faces, if that makes any difference.  I have used small caps in the past for entering names of Unicode characters in documentation &#40;e.g., LATIN SMALL LETTER THORN&#41; when they occur in running text, and I think that this use does look better with small caps at x-height size &#40;more or less&#41; than it would with taller ones.  I have also seen a word beginning with a cap and the rest in small caps, where a larger size small cap works better.  I&#39;m not sure about all this, which is why I&#39;m asking . . .  <BR> <BR>David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are some small caps versions that have different points of view. Personaly I have a curiosity to understand better some combinations and aspects. This AGaramound that have the l/c align to 5-6% than x-height are design to big sizes? Perhaps they have few legibility to small sizes?. Probably the better way is you define a size and try to experiment some tests with different sizes betten x-height and the capital line.  <BR> <BR>What the typophile community think about the figures, punctuation, basic characters?  <BR> <BR>Ricardo <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am an author who occasionally makes his own fonts. I am currently using MS-Word2000 going all the way through to colour-pdf separations for film. I want the whole book to be in a single font--it&#39;s working OK, except that when I select small-caps through the format command, Word just makes the small-caps a smaller point-size. I want to embed a smallcap alphabet in my trutype font which MS-word then knows to select. Is this impossible? Is this what open types is for? I only have fontographer version 3 and the cheaper &#39;font creation program&#39;. <BR></div>
