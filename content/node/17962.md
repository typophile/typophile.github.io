  add pics to the message after you create a new topic.\r\nIf someone could inform
  me on how to do that would be great.\r\n\r\nI have gone back and made more changes
  to my typeface.\r\nI smoothed out alot of the curves and I also thickened up a lot
  of\r\nthe horizontal bars. That definetly made it feel better on paper.\r\nI also
  added an alt version with no desending serifs. Also please\r\nexcuse the spacing
  on some of the letters. I forgot to \r\ndo that last night.\r\n\r\nLet me know what
  you think.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n< J o s e p h >"
