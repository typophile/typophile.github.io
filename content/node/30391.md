  face that I could use to recreate this? I could Photoshop it up, but I'd rather
  just use something off the shelf if possible.

      just a little bit of distressed or hand-rendered character and I can never find
      anything. Everything's usually deconstructed as hell (e.g., Frankie). Cape-Arcona
      has a few that are nice and that I use frequently, but none are a good match
      for this.\r\n\r\n--\r\nSPENCER CROSS\r\n[professional] http://tokyofarm.com\r\n[personal]

    target="_blank">recreations for props</a>. None of the downloadable freebies are
    similar to your graphic and Lehman's sample images are minimalistic, but you might
    e-mail him about similarity with his Gothic 520 and Times Gothic fonts.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions. Lehman's collection is great, and exactly the
    sort of thing I've been looking for. And it's only $20?!?\r\n\r\nI've got plenty
    of experience distressing things in Photoshop, but that's a little different than
    the hand-drawn quality I'm looking for. I've never been able to figure out a good
    way to simulate the not quite perfect joins and not quite 90\xBA angles when using
    a source that's so geometrically sound. Still, I know plenty of people that will
    find that link useful.\r\n\r\n--\r\nSPENCER CROSS\r\n[professional] http://tokyofarm.com\r\n[personal]
