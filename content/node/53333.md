body: "My first semi-serious attempt. Intentionally not a very original typeface;
  the proportions are very Bodonian, while there's a lot of Fleischmann and some Dwiggins
  influence in the details. There's bound to be a lot of beginner's mistakes, I know,
  please tell me, so I can improve. Any kind of critique is very welcome indeed. The
  spacing is still very basic.\r\n\r\nEr, and hello, everyone. This is my very first
  post, after lurking for several weeks. What a wonderful resource Typophile is! I
  only wish I'd discovered it sooner. \r\n\r\nS.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/austeria_4939.png]"

  body: Solid. All I can see is that the arm of the k looks rather small and light
    to me, and that there's something awkward about the bottom of the C that I can't
    quite put into words.

  body: 'Thanks for your comment! You are perfectly right about the k, and I see a
    lot of other problems now as well, as I''ve just made the first paper prints.
    I will make a lot of adjustments. There pdf has some strange alignment errors,
    by the way. I will post a revised version soon.  '

  body: I get the logic of making the serifs thicker when they end thin strokes (for
    example vwxyKMNVWXY), but the mismatch of angles is bothersome to my eyes.

  body: "Thanks for your reply, Eliason, you're absolutely right. The odd angles are
    all gone now. In fact, every single glyph is revised, and I've updated the preview
    image and the pdf. I've also started working on a boldface, but I'm resisting
    the temptation of starting work on the italic. (Gee, this is really ruining my
    social life.) \r\n\r\nPlease, tell me what you think!"

  body: The fi-lig + accent is an interesting idea, but it might be distracting. Have
    you considered an alternate f, that doesn't stretch so far out to the right?

  body: "Yes, as a matter of fact, I've made such a ligature for [[http://typophile.com/node/56025|Schola]],
    the typeface I'm working on at the moment. It's not shown in the specimen, though,
    but I will upload some text setting examples showing it later today, after a bit
    of spacing and kerning. \r\n\r\nF\xED is a very frequent letter combination in
    Old Norse and Icelandic, as you probably know. \r\n\r\nI've abandoned work on
    Austeria, it was my very first attempt at drawing a typeface, and I think it needs
    major redrawing. Perhaps I'll start anew when Schola is finished; I still like
    the idea of mixing Fleischmann's quirkiness with Bodoni's austerity. I think Jorge
    Luis Borges would have liked such a typeface."
