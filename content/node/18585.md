  body: "Travis, \r\n\r\nno, it's not really the same. Adrian Frutiger drew two different
    ampersands for his Univers typeface. Linotype used one, Bitstream used the other.
    Zurich is simply a renamed Univers, while Arial and Helvetica are similar but
    different typefaces. Bitstream digitized Univers but they were not able to obtain
    permission from Linotype to use the Univers trademark so they released it as Zurich.
    In 2003, Linotype and Bitstream signed an agreement according to which Zurich
    is an \"authorized version\" of Univers -- but the name Zurich is still used.
    \r\n\r\nA."

  body: 'I should also mention that for many years, Adrian Frutiger was deeply unhappy
    about Bitstream''s decision to publish Zurich, Humanist 777 and other renamed
    versions of his typefaces. Unitl Bitstream signed the agreement with Linotype,
    the company was considered by many as a "guerilla foundry" of a sort. Bitstream''s
    library includes some other renamed versions of other typefaces but not all were
    unauthorized. For example, Linotype  once published Matthew Carter''s Shelley
    Script and then Bitstream published it as English 111. Matthew Carter was one
    of Bitstream''s co-founders so English 111 is obviously authorized -- but Linotype
    owns the trademark Shelley Script. Similarly, Zapf Humanist and Zapf Calligraphic
    801 were versions of Optima and Palatino autorized by Hermann Zapf but were published
    by Bitstream under other names since Linotype owns the trademarks. '

  body: travis, fyi, there is no need to post the same question to 2 different boards
    on typophile. 1 will suffice.
