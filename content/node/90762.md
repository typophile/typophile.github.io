body: Hello all! I'm currently in a package design course, and I'm redesigning Dr.
  Oetker's Mug Cake packaging. It's not all that bad as it is, I just needed to get
  a product that has a package within a package. What I'm wondering now is, what would
  be a good font for the product name? After strolling around the grocery store for
  awhile, I found that similar products (like Betty Crocker's Warm Temptations) used
  a sort of handwritten script font. Makes sense. They definitely give that feeling
  of indulgence and decadence. I even found an example of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/fancier-script/">one</a>
  I find suitable. But for the sake of maybe doing something different, I figured
  I'd ask the ultra knowledgeable bunch here for some other possible options. I want
  some of your smarts to rub off on me. And for the record, I can't ask my teacher.
  She used Bleeding Cowboys for her friend's logo.

  body: I first saw 'Hoppsan!' in a Swedish-drawn (I think) pictorial about the SR-71
    Blackbird. The meaning seemed to be 'Whoopsie!' as it was used in a panel about
    sudden changes in altitude during course changes in very thin air.
