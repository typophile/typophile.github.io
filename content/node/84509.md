body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nI'm pretty new to all this and am constructing my first font.
  I've created a pretty complete set of glyphs + ligatures, then got FontLab to create
  a bold version and a italic (in truth a slanted) version of this. FontLab did an
  ok job with the bold version, I did have to redraw a lot of the glyphs. The 'italic'
  version was pretty straightforward... but it somehow just won't work on my system...\r\n\r\nI
  did follow the naming conventions - as far as I can tell - but maybe I did something
  wrong. Restarting Illustrator or Photoshop doesn't seem to do the trick so I'm kinda
  lost here. Any suggestions as to what a starter could be doing wrong?\r\n\r\nHere
  is a screenshot of my font info for the three fonts:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/loose_problem_5200.jpg]"

    appropriate fonts on the first page of the Font Header?

    been experimenting with the typeface - it seems now that for other people it works
    just fine - so something might be wrong with my PC or Illustrator/Photoshop (where
    i'm testing them). I've tried to clear my font cache but that doesn't seem to
    work...\r\n\r\nany tips?"

  body: 'Not using any font management software - I''m on a Vista machine and it looks
    like something is (indeed) going wrong with the font cache. On other machines
    it appears to work just fine! I finally got it to work ok but when I updated the
    (now 4 weights) font files I had a similar issue: Illustrator and Photoshop both
    did show the font with the 4 weights, but a number of kerning details and even
    a few glyph changes that I made weren''t visible. Even when I deinstalled the
    fonts, both Illustrator and Photoshop still had the font in their list (after
    restarting them of course).  '

    you wipe them, restart, and then reinstall?\r\n\r\nI did try restarting the PC
    and a few times it worked ok, but not every time. \r\nRestarting the machine (in
    my case) does take quite some time so doing that after each change is a rather
    tiresome process though?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yeah, it's clumsy. I'm on Windows 7 and even sometimes when deleting fonts
    from the system they stay there even though they're not showing. Try both ways.

    success with this method:\r\n\r\nInstall fonts via Suitcase Fusion.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I need to update the font, I delete the current version from Suitcase.\r\n\r\nClose
    the program.\r\n\r\nClose FMCore.exe (via Task Manager)\r\n\r\nCreate the new
    font.\r\n\r\nReopen suitcase and reinstall the font.\r\n\r\nThis is the best method
    I have found that doesn't require me restarting my computer."

    3 tip! I'll try that method, sounds like a better way than continuously restarting
    my system!

    deactivate or rally install / delete? I see the option in the menu but it is disabled

    just dragged the font over the "font library" location to install them.

  body: "Yeah man, me too, thanks for all the tips!\r\n\r\nOne other question regarding
    font families:\r\nin Fontlab you can set the Font Info and Styles, but have I
    correctly assumed that this is restricted to Regular / Bold / Italic / Bold Italic?\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you want to add a Thin or Light variant, you'll need to basically create a
    new family called FONT Thin or FONT Light?"

    change the "weight" selection. Then change the names to "Loose-Thin, Loose Thin
    etc."

    my software (Illustrator / Photoshop) didn't regognise it as a separate weight
    and I had two 'regular' versions conflicting with each other.\r\n\r\nI've now
    set it as follows, but the result is (obviously) a separate family:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Loose_Thin_4665.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny

    The only oddity is that in the Font List is that the order is as follows:\r\n\r\n<em>Thin\r\nThin
    Italic\r\nLight Italic\r\nLight\r\nRegular\r\nItalic\r\nBold\r\nBold Italic</em>\r\n\r\nNot
    sure why it lists the Light Italic before the Light as only exeption, but pretty
    content that it's working!"
