body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nThere is so much about design I have yet to learn. I just play
  with graphics on my mac but I would like to take it to the next level some day.
  \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is something I'm playing with. A business card for a friend...
  just playing around... she does not own a business nor is she even black...hehehehe.
  \ Its cute and that's why I like it. \r\n\r\nI think there is something wrong with
  the address placement. Perhaps there may be a scale problem too with some of the
  stars.\r\n\r\nTell me what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\n\r\nPS...
  sugar, spice and everything nice was the inspiration.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick> The colors I have planned in mind do not accurately display on our
    RGB monitors. The green will be more brilliant and the orange and the yellow will
    not be muddy. I have Pantone colors marked for each color here.\r\n\r\nBut I'm
    not concerned with that.... its the balance of the elements and the address that's
    driving me crazy. \r\n\r\nI may even make the card double sided and put the address
    on the other side but I'm not sure yet....\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me what you think,\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n\r\n\r\nPS...
    I do intend to have the card professionally offset printed if I'm satisfied...
    for fun or not."

  body: "I would make the Erin's name larger and check the kerning especially the
    apostrophe s. It is reading CUNIC to me, you could kern out the first I and even
    have it hanging off the R's vertical and adjust the INI kerning so it is equal
    while tightening the RO. Since you are making things align in AFRO CLINIC you
    might align the address with that, for example on the vertical of the L. As for
    the stars a more varied scale could help the movement and try having some come
    from behind the figure and type. The figure's neck is bothering me as well there
    is a triangular shape, presumably a collar, that is not working as a silhouette
    and her right earring looks quite large. Nick's point about the colour is worth
    bearing in mind because unless you are having that printed in  spot colour, I
    counted 7 (which will be expensive, even if you can find a printer that has the
    capacity to do that), four colour process doesn't handle purples and oranges that
    well, I suppose you could go Hexachrome (which will also be expensive).\r\nTim"

  body: "Hey,\r\nIf its just for fun, you would want to print it in cmyk. I dont think
    that a printer would print process colours unless its above 1000 units. And with
    all those colours, it is expencive.\r\nThat said, I really like the idea and fonts.
    I agree with Timid, and maybe have it like:\r\n\r\n758 Terrace St\r\nSantee CA,\r\n99960\r\n\r\n803-670-9014\r\n\r\nJust
    a suggestion. But it is a good idea to have the address follow the invisible line
    of the \"L\". Also you might check that the stars are not geeting in the way of
    the readability of \"erin ferrell's\".\r\n\r\nHope it helped, and good luck.\r\n\r\n>ER"
