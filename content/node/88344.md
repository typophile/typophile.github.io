body: "I've been working lately on a font with Greek in it. I decided to take the
  plunge and make polytonic characters for it. But the coding, argh, the coding! I
  read through these two threads on the topic\u2014[[http://www.typophile.com/node/83725]],
  [[http://typophile.com/node/15982]]\u2014to get the gist of the issue. The take-home
  messages I got were:\r\n\u2014A principle that one should stick by is to make all
  changes reversible. So, if a user presses a button to capitalize the glyph \u1FF4,
  your font shouldn't turn it into two separate characters \u038F+\u03B9 or \u038F+\u0399,
  because then if the user tries to turn that letter back to the original lowercase,
  it turns into \u03CE+\u03B9. \r\n\u2014When you set Greek in all-caps, the accents
  disappear, except for the dialytika (\xA8). And you get an extra dialytika on a
  (bare) Iota if the vowel before it has an accent, so that \u03C1\u03C9\u03BC\u03AD\u03B9\u03BA\u03B1
  becomes \u03A1\u03A9\u039C\u0395\u03AA\u039A\u0391. \r\n\r\nBut I still have some
  questions about how I need to go ahead.\r\n\r\nSince I'm kind of a low-tech guy
  and couldn't think of an easy way to do it better, I handwrote the questions and
  scanned them. (You can disregard question 1d, because after I wrote it and scanned
  it, I looked again at the thread in the first link, and realized the question was
  answered there.) So, here they are.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7024/6516177469_bc5497426b_b.jpg\"></img>\r\n<img

  body: "A good tool to look at the effect of features is the FontForge metrics window.
    You can paste directly your Greek polytonic text (that you can get from <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus%3Acorpus%3Aperseus%2CGreek%20Texts\">Perseus</a>)
    \ in the small window at the top and activate at will the features to see not
    only the resulting glyphs but also their name. If the name does not fit below
    the display, you can hover the cursor on top of the letter in the display to get
    the full information on it. Here is something interesting from John Hudson's <a
    href=\"http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLGreek.aspx\">SBL Greek</a>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kerningwindow_4826.png]\r\n\r\nHere
    calt, smcp, ss03 and a few other features were on and I kept the cursor on top
    of the iotadierisis to get its full name. "

  body: "Ooh, thanks for pointing me to SBL Greek. Nice font. That's a pretty cool
    alternate Iotadieresis.\r\n\r\nI've been doing something similar with FontLab,
    which also lets you see resulting glyphs' names. But I can't figure out what combination
    of features gets me to the single-glyph \u03A9\u0399 and \u0391\u0399 combinations
    that Arno gives when I press the TT button (question 1a). \r\n\r\nI note that
    SBL Greek uses the capital-shaped small iotas in its small caps, so I'll probably
    use those (question 2a). "

  body: "I don't know how InDesign proceeds. With Arno Pro, in the particular case
    of \u03C1\u03C9\u03BC\u03AD\u03B9\u03BA\u03B1 put in small caps, the pdf produced
    by TextEdit uses <code>iota.c</code> for the iota (dieresis) smallcap, which is
    what I see in FontForge. However, the pdf produced by InDesign (CS 3) uses <code>u03CA.a</code>
    instead. Where InDesign got that, I don't know. I could find no combination of
    features giving <code>u03CA.a</code> in the FontForge metrics window."

  body: "I figured out how to get the single-glyph \u03A9\u0399 and \u0391\u0399 combinations
    in the OpenType window! It's hidden in <code>calt</code>. Type the single-glyph
    \u03A9\u03B9 combination, and then type any capital Greek letter. \u03A9\u03B9
    changes into \u03A9\u0399!\r\n\r\nI still wonder about question 1a, though (what
    does InDesign do when you press the [TT] button?). Do I need to tell InDesign
    to do anything special for all-capping Greek, or can I just trust it to know the
    right characters to switch to? And why does the \"UPPERCASE\" command work differently
    from the [TT] button?\r\n\r\nI also still need to know question 2b (Can I make
    my font so that the default <code>smcp</code> forms in Greek have accents on them?).
    I suppose it makes sense to base my default behavior around modern monotonic Greek.
    So: if you had a text in modern Greek, and you clicked the small-caps button,
    would you find it bizarre to see the small-caps letters keep their tonoi? (I had
    to look up the plural of tonos.)"
