&lsquo;reality show&rsquo; to the bank. their pampered fat asses shit stuff better than i eat.
i love you all so much.</p>
<pre><code>                          where is the land of the freaks, home of bravado?

                          why does it have to be a convention that unbinds 
                          hands, wardrobes, tongues, minds...

                          i do indeed feel that there was a 'westward ho' 
                          sort of thing which happened over the past two 
                          decades. i know a lot of ex-new yorkers, 
                          chicagoans, southerners in washington myself. 

                          but once they ended up here, a good chunk of life 
                          later, what have they found?

                          a little bit of security, but not enough to 
                          sidestep a centimeter of the rat race. 

                          a million cheques to write each month, most of 
                          them to safeco subsidiaries.

                          grey dismal skies most of the time, nowhere to 
                          actually swim.

                          sullen nordic neighbors with loaded guns and 
                          opinions.

                          statewide laws and mores which reflect the 
                          standards of only one affluent, conservative 
                          community.

                          'intellectuals' and artists who rely more on 
                          social networking and externalia to cement their 
                          self esteem in everyone's rolodex.

                          an inflated sense of 'city esteem' grossly 
                          disproportionate to achievement and culture. 

                         this is a small town by any metropolitan standards.

                          you can't take a trot downtown without dozens of 
                          familiar faces. 

                          downtown? a few blocks...

                          the sheer anonymity of rio &amp; bombay, even for a 
                          white man is a heady, heady thing

                          yes it's not all that bad, the buds are good...
                          but that may just be the problem.

                          everybody i know is chemically numb - or retreats 
                          to that numbness. i mean everybody. mood-control 
                          pills are no different from alcoholism or chronic 
                          masturbation. 

                          i don't believe in temperance, not a whit.
                          but when you're high just to cope, just to get by, 
                          something's wrong. 

                          when you're afraid to cross the street against the 
                          light for fear of a jaywalking ticket, it's time 
                          to move to budapest. what an irony.

                          look at our recent 'riots'
                          cause in the main by a bunch of dork nazi police 
                          who just wanted try out their equipment and 
                          methods. zero awareness of the interactivity of 
                          social equations.

                          nothing of the sort could ever have happened 
                          in -------- i wont name names because that becomes 
                          another pecker contest. lets just say that there 
                          are, even in amerika, places where amiable 
                          authorities and generally fun-loving citizens meet 
                          in the street without tear gas.

                          &quot;you don't like it? leave!&quot; says mr. larson

                          i shall, and many like me, this will once again be 
                          the land of larson and robocop. 

                          thy grim legislature can continue to pass laws 
                          about passing laws. modified versions of the 
                          'pledge of allegiance,' amended to include 
                          employer, insurance agent, and immediate superior, 
                          will be recited at each place of employ.

                          the television shows about prison life will start 
                          soon. social engineering - to get everyone used to 
                          the fact that in 20 years, at the current rates of 
                          incarceration, 25% of americans will be or have 
                          been in jail - for crimes varying from selling 
                          crystals of certain frequencies to possession of 
                          naturally occurring weeds which grow almost 
                          anywhere, peeing behind a dumpster, having an old 
                          beer can with half an inch of liquid in it in the 
                          back seat &amp;&amp;&amp;

                          it is a small cold grey place. the reins of power 
                          are held by small cold grey people.

                          the pockets of respite, of intensity are just that 
                          - pockets. rebellion is intrinsically 
                          self-destructive or miraculously grows older, and 
                          then sells out. and in these very small 
                          sub-communities, nobody looks around. the us and 
                          them game is perhaps a little too scary.

                          maybe i'm just upset because i missed the big fun 
                          party. i didn't get to trot out my silky mages 
                          robes, my snow-leopard cloak or cartaphilus' 
                          leather apron and 10 ad roman short sword...</code></pre>
