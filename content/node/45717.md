body: I'm currently in the process of designing my own notebooks suited to my own
  needs. I have been using simple plain white paper or standard lined pages for years
  now and I think it's time for a change. Is there any particular style of notebook
  or grid system common to type design notebooks? Or are their specific types of notebooks
  for type design? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

    sketchbook</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/books/multicolour_sketchbook/\">multicolor
    sketchbook</a>\r\n\r\nI generally prefer blank paper, e.g. the Vang Skizzenbuch
    primo, but this is meanwhile hard to find. So at the moment my favorite is from
    <a href=\"http://www.mujionline.co.uk/\">Muji</a> (there is a search form, but
    you can search the stationary section as well): the <strong>EVA Zipper Double
    Ringnote</strong>. It is available in A5 and A6. There are superfine dots on the
    paper which don't distract and the surface is very smooth and a joy to write on.
    But even better is the integrated semi-opaque plastic zipper bag on the front.
    Here you can store snippets with notes and even a pencil or whatever use- or playful
    you fancy. Although I'd wish they'd offer more sizes some day, the A5 is fine
    to always have in the bag. \r\n\r\n"

    pamphlet-stitched single signatures (making small ones to tuck into my purse),
    and have recycled almost every blank book I've built in a class or as a model
    also.\r\n\r\nMy fave is one I've learned recently, a two-needle Japanese sewn
    binding with multiple signatures: the big advantage to it is that it lays flat,
    which is pretty nifty. Haven't found a tutorial for it on the 'net, but there
    must be one somewhere.\r\n\r\n(Edit: no tutorial, but a nice diagram of it can
    be found on http://www.graemedawes.co.uk/ under \"Japanese Bookbinding\" and thence
    \"Sewn Styles\": scroll to the bottom to find <em>retchoso</em>.)"
