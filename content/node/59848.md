body: "Here you can find some images of the fonts i have made...\r\n\r\ni don't consider
  myself as typographer, i just simply made fonts just for the fun of it and for my
  own amusement...some of them have been shown at the two past Letras Latinas (latin
  american type biennial) and the Tipos Latinos (latin american type biennial in 2008)
  in several cities of Latin America such as Buenos Aires, Santiago, Sao Paulo, Lima
  and Mexico City and also have been shown at the TypeCon in Seattle in 2007.\r\n\r\nConfundida
  and Hellvetica are postmodern style type experiments and are the result of mixing
  type styles (script and sans bold, old english gothic and helvetica).\r\n\r\nDemasiado
  Coraz\xF3n (too much heart) is a dingbat font inspired in Frida Kahlo's and old
  religious paintings.\r\n\r\nTzompantli (aztec word describing a wall made of skulls)
  is both a type and a dingbat font made for an art installation about Las muertas
  de Juarez (the dead women of Juarez).\r\n\r\nKelvin is a retro font based in 40s
  and 50s car names plates.\r\n\r\nPetr\xF3leo Crudo an Petr\xF3leo Negro are stencil
  grungy fonts, and last (but not least) La Mancha is a font based in the proportions
  of Garamond and was made for the title of Cervante's Don Quixiote book\r\n\r\nHope
  you find them interesting\r\n\r\n"
