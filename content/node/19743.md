body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\n\r\nI have taken an interest in metal (lead) type.
  I have the opportunity to print at both my colleges. I have read the following book
  \"Boek over het maken van boeken\" and I observed someone else (making a business
  card for herself). \r\n\r\nI would like to typeset a poem (The Motive for Metaphor,
  by Wallace Stevens http://pocast.com/?p=88). The fonts I can use are limited. From
  the list of the fonts they have (the complete list below) I have chosen 'Nobel'
  for the title and name of the author and for the body text I was thinking about
  'Spectrum'. \r\n\r\nMy questions: 1) if you begin to typeset with lead type would
  you start with a poem (most people only print business cards)? 2) Would you start
  learning using fonts you do not know (not that I know any font personally)? 3) Which
  font would you're choice to start with? 4) Are there any books you would recommend
  too read before you try printing with lead type (it doesn't have to be in english)?\r\n\r\nMy
  goal is too (eventually) typeset a small booklet (someday; after I have practiced;
  a lot).\r\n\r\nThank you for you're time.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nTerence\r\n\r\n\r\nList
  of Fonts\r\n\r\nAntieke\r\nBaskerville\r\nBordoni\r\nEgmont\r\nEgyptienne\r\nGaramont\r\nGill\r\nHelvetica\r\nHildago\r\nIris\r\nNobel\r\nSpectrum\r\nTimes\r\nVenus\r\n\r\n"

    metal, but others on this forum have kept the <em>Black Art</em> alive.\r\n\r\n>
    <em>My questions:\r\n\r\n1) if you begin to typeset with lead type would you start
    with a poem (most people only print business cards)?</em>\r\n\r\nIn my opionion,
    a poem is fine, perhaps even better. Just keep the entire poem with title and
    author on a single sheet. Traditional poems have standardized typographic guidelines
    such as, line for line, flush left/ragged right with indents on lines that run
    over, etc. Review several quality books of poetry to understand how poems are
    set typographically.\r\n\r\n<em>2) Would you start learning using fonts you do
    not know (not that I know any font personally)?</em>\r\n\r\nI think that matters
    less than the selection of metal fonts and sizes that are available to work with.\r\n\r\n<em>3)
    Which font would you\u2019re choice to start with?</em>\r\n\r\nAgain, I think
    it matters less than the selection available, but for a traditional poem, at least
    try serifs first. It really concerns the \"tone\" of the poem itself. Try setting
    a line or two on the same sheet with different fonts. This will give you a sense
    of what might work better.\r\n\r\n<em>4) Are there any books you would recommend
    too read before you try printing with lead type (it doesn\u2019t have to be in
    english)?</em>\r\n\r\nHere are a few links I have bookmarked for myself related

  body: "> Review several quality books of poetry to understand how poems are set
    typographically.\r\n\r\nI want to elaborate on this good advice. Ignore any poetry
    book printed after 1984. It is possible that it is well set, but that is the year
    that DTP started (well, soon after) and this meant books could be set by non-experts
    in typography.\r\n\r\nBooks set pre-1984, if bound well and on good paper, probably
    followed the typographic conventions Norbert is mentioning."

    Because of its current reality and its inherent limitations (compared to what

    you what it will; resist the urge to over-plan and fully control the experience.\r\n2)

    a printing issue, and I'm not sure if I'm right because we're not looking at it
    at the real size, but to me it looks like you have a bit too much leading betweem
    the lines in the quatrains, which weakens the look. And do correct your spelling!
    Somehow it looks worse when it is in print, because the print looks so good. "

  body: "Great for a first print! Pretty good word-spacing too.\r\nI have never set
    with individual slugs, just with prepared plates. I actually have a whole fount
    of a Civilit\xE9 which is very nice, though I've never had the patience to try
    and print with it.\r\n\r\nIf you want more lead type, I would suggest checking
    out Ohio. Many cities, Cincinnati in particular, were major printing centers,
    and there is much old printing equipment to be found. I saw someone on eBay selling
    dozens of complete fonts (amounting to hundreds of pounds of lead) for just a
    couple hundred dollars, but obviously you had to pick it up yourself as such a
    thing would be difficult to ship. Naturally these were mostly newspaper and old
    commercial types, but would be a cool thing to have if you get into printing.\r\n\r\nI
    have inquired before about full sets of new metal type, and it is horribly expensive,
    costing about $100 for one each A-Z, numbers and some punctuation. That was for
    Centaur. And I would expect you would need several sets to do a single page. The
    point is, if you see some old lead type for cheap, you might as well make the
    effort to buy it if you plan on doing a lot of letterpress.   "

    imagine that there are too many that made it to metal form in the late-19th, early-20th
    century. As far as I know, it was never a really popular letter style to begin
    with, I don't know if it was ever used outside of northern France and the Low
    Countries, and it pretty much disappeared after the 17th century until Linotype
    and Monotype. It seems to crop up on Lebanese restaurant menus a lot. Funny where
    type ends up."
