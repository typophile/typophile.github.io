body: "I just posted a [[http://betatype.com/node/50|beta of a new geometric]] I have
  been playing with. For now I'm calling it Aperture, but I'm open to suggestions.
  Also, keep in mind that this is an early beta so it's still pretty rough; I only
  started the thing three days ago.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mathematiques_6544.png]"

    really geometric, but a hand drawn, asymmetrical rendition of a geometric."

  body: "Wow. Just noticed that you already used the word \"wobbly\" in your blog
    \u2014\_but not in reference to this one. This is certainly more straight-laced
    than some of your others, but your personality still creeps in. No harm in that."

  body: ">> hand drawn, asymmetrical rendition of a geometric\r\n\r\n: ) I just couldn't
    force myself to take the mathematical hard line in some of the sticky places.
    Some of the wobbly will probably go away with some polish. (What's the right formula
    for the stroke widths on a black 'w' !?) I agree, though, that it gives the face
    some personality."

    cheap out there or something? But seriously, this is pretty nifty, it\u2019s sort
    of like Futura meets Myriad."

    MORNING he comes to the office with a new typeface he just whipped up on the train,
    or while in the bathroom. :)
