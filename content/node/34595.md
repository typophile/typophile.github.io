  need to make the time to go out on walks, swim, collect little bits of things, take
  photos, get drunk (or not), talk to friends, etc. So, you have to wonder, who wouldn\u2019t
  want to spend 5 nights on an island while talking about and working with type? British
  Columbia in the summertime is heaven on earth\u2014a place where most people would
  be happy to kick back and relax for a week, but if you\u2019re into typography you
  can relax your body and exercise your brain at the same time. Three typographers,
  Marian Bantjes, Shelley Gruendler and Ross Mills will offer differing and convergent
  approaches to type in a relaxed but structured program over six days. Participants
  will be reintroduced to some type basics as well as learn through observation and
  applications of how to think of type in new ways. Through a series of lectures and
  workshops, you will be as immersed in type as you are in nature. The group is limited
  to a maximum of 20 participants, so it will be close-knit and hands-on. Be prepared
  to get your hands dirty in some form or another and to come away with an experience
  to fuel your future projects.\r\n\r\nThis is appropriate for anyone interested in
  typography and design, although you should be conversant enough to talk about type
  in basic technical terms. Our \u201Cback to basics\u201D pre-session isn\u2019t
  that basic. Optional sessions will include visiting the rules of typography, but
  most of our time will be spent in a more inquisitive approach.\r\n\r\nFor more information,

    learn more in such an idyllic setting with yourself, Marian, and Ross.

    it for ages so it was time to just go ahead and start the ball rolling. The projects
    are quite interesting and through them, the students will get portfolio pieces
    as well as experiment a bit with new approaches. \r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to
    having both of you come up to teach a session next summer, eh? Stephen, you're
    overdue a visit!"

    year, I think a type-based vacation on Galiano would be a nice alternative. I'll
    be lurking on your web site. :-)"
