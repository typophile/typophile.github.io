  made block printing, his own book binding, wrote about typography and so on. One
  of the thing he mentioned (and did/showed) was fake alphabets, made up language
  that he would write and create.\r\nIt seemed like quite a lot of people did this
  kind of thing, and there was a name for it.\r\nHaving lost the link to the blog
  and google search having been unfruitful I was wondering if anyone here knew of
  the name ( for the act of creating a fake language/alphabet) and/or maybe a blog
  that would talk about such things.\r\n\r\nI am not looking for this particular blog,
  I assume there is more than one, the term/name however would be greatly appreciated,
  I do remember that the writer was a teacher at a university or art school, American
  or Canadian.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for the link! there are some really good examples, I scanned the
    texts pretty fast ( but will go back to them, there are some references/names
    that I will be able to dig up further), yet I don't think I saw a 'name' given
    to this type of typography.\r\n\r\nI did find the term Artlang through wikipedia,
    describing for example the elvish language of JRR.Tolkien's universe as artlang,
    if anyone know of another way to call it..\r\n\r\nIt seems like Luigi Serafini's
    Codex Seraphinianus is the closest thing from what I remember in the blog I mentioned,
    in his calligraphic, hand-drawn approach .  "

  body: Conlang (constructed language) is another term for made-up languages. I haven't
    seen as much discussion of made-up writing systems, although it has a certain
    connection with traditional cryptography; in an [[http://typophile.com/node/15692|earlier
    thread here]] it was referred to as [[http://www.langmaker.com/neographies.htm|neography]].

  body: "Invented writing systems tend to be called <em>constructed scripts</em> (Sometimes
    abbreviated as \"con-script\", though not as often since \"conscript\" is a word),
    and they can be either be for a conlang or for existing languages. Some are little
    more than substitution ciphers, some are more complex.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavian_alphabet\">Shavian</a>,
    for example, is a phonetic alphabet designed for English, intended seriously.
    Its glyphs so heavily rely on rotations and reflections that it is impractical
    for even the mildly dyslexic, but its celebrity origin gives it enough esteem
    that it has an official Unicode block.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/alternative.htm\">Omniglot.com</a>
    has compiled plenty of these to look at."
