  looks and would like to use it for headlines and such. the actual img on the site
  is too small for me to make sure, so i WTFed the larger one found at brandsoftheworld;
  i can't rely on BOTW having the most accurate versions of logos. the two closest
  results for that WTF are \"Helvetica 83 Heavy Extended Oblique\" and \"Helvetica
  Neue Exp Heavy Obl\". do either of those sound about right for the actual ito en
  logo?\r\n\r\nalex.rosario\r\napollolux.digital.designs"

  body: "I don't think the lowercase is Helvetica; look at the lowercase c. They could
    be two different fonts. Maybe someone took the logo and just added the \"Welcome
    to\" in the default font on his software or just some font he liked.\r\n\r\nThe
    ITO EN is definitely quite close to Helvetica, and I would guess it is. Those
    characters aren't particularly characteristic of most fonts, however, so you're
    going to have some difficulty determining the exact font with just these characters,
    and you should probably choose the font by looking at the more characteristic
    characters."
