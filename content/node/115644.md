  when my PC crashed, I lost absolutely all data. I've been trying to find this font
  for months now, but no matter which font identification site I tried, it kept showing
  me wrong results. If anyone knows/could help with identification, I would be endlessly
  grateful.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_6521.jpg]"
