  public at large, in printing such works as his famed 42-line Bible, Johannes Gutenberg
  employed a font which contained one alternate version of nearly every letter. This
  was done so that the books he printed would look like handwritten manuscripts, not
  betraying their mechanically printed nature through every copy of the same letter
  being identical.\r\nWhile this was no doubt a very reasonable thing to do at a time
  when the handwritten manuscript was the very definition of a book, and thus the
  measure of quality for a book, it still strikes modern readers as strange. The mechanical
  perfection of today's books seems to be one of the things that makes them beautiful
  and easy to read.\r\nAnd yet, there's one realm where precisely this level of conservatism
  persists to the present day. Fonts used for lettering comic books, comic strips,
  and webcomics strive to simulate hand lettering as closely as possible, often by
  providing alternate forms of each character (usually by being all-caps fonts, and
  letting the alternates be selected with the shift key).\r\nThus, at Comicraft, we
  have [[http://www.comicbookfonts.com/Chatterbox-p/bl029.htm|Chatterbox]], which
  appears to me to be closely patterned after the lettering of Sam Rosen, as an example
  of how comic fonts follow lettering. This page,\r\n[[http://bullyscomics.blogspot.ca/2011/01/credit-where-credit-is-due.html]]\r\nshows
  his lettering, that of Artie Simek, and that of a few other Marvel letterers.\r\nOf
  course, there were many unsuccessful attempts to use typographical techniques for
  comic lettering.\r\nThus, this blog page contains an old Charlton comic in which
  the word balloons were done using a fixed-pitch comic font for the Varityper.\r\n[[http://fourcolorshadows.blogspot.ca/2013/06/captain-atom-rocco-mastroserio-1961.html]]\r\nAnd
  EC Comics used a Leroy lettering tool (commonly used by draftsmen for neat lettering)
  for word balloons on its comics, and the results were also unattractive:\r\n[[http://marswillsendnomore.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/his-mechanical-brain-is-charged-with-all-knowledge/]]\r\n(of
  course, the story was a classic for the ages, but that is another matter).\r\nOn
  the other hand, plain old Univers\r\n[[http://mikophoto.net/wordpress/?attachment_id=1813]]\r\nworked
  out just fine for Dave Berg's \"The Lighter Side Of...\" feature in MAD magazine.\r\nAs
  for Comic Sans, the webcomic [[http://barbarianprincess.com/?p=153|The Challenges
  of Zona]] started out using that face; while it's a great comic, the face is not
  that good for comics, as you can see."

  body: "The only webcomic that pulls off Comic Sans is Order of the Stick, because
    it is a match for its art style of primitive round-ended strokes, chosen in all
    self-awareness (and, of course, because it seldom tries to extend the font's utility
    beyond the five-pixel x-height it was made for).\r\n\r\nAs for Zona, a comic made
    of 3D models with no hint of anything like an actual ink line anywhere has no
    reason to limit itself to typefaces that mimic inked lettering, even good ones.
    I think digital artists who want their work to be like movies would do well to
    consider the way MAD separated words from pictures, obliterating any suggestion
    that the words were part of the pictures."
