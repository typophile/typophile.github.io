  from the 1930 the ARM-27.\r\nTrying to find a font that was used or was created
  on old ship lettering around the 1930.\r\nI don't really know if it even exist but
  i was curious if there is such a font available.\r\nTrying to google for such a
  font but no good match.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "In 1930 a font was something made of metal (or wood) and intended for putting
    ink on paper. Any large lettering on an irregular surface (like a boat) would
    have been hand-painted. \r\nTry searching for Dutch signs from that period (shops,
    bars, restaurants, hotels, etc.) and you'll probably find the sort of lettering
    you would have seen on boats. "

    signs billboards etc.\r\nThought it was a long shot at best since the 1930 is
    real old for PC fonts :)\r\nI hope i can find a font that looks from that period
    although i doubt it."

    Dancer]]. It has a handmade feel and some similar features to your lettering.
    It's also based on old lettering from early 1910-era.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
