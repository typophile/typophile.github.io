  museums do you recommend from your perspective?\r\n2. What are the must-see in that
  field?"

    see Ensch\xE9d\xE9 Museum in Haarlem, Netherlands, and the Stephenson Blake Museum

    in the US, Hamilton (god do I want to go)\r\nhttp://woodtype.org/\r\n\r\nGermany
    has Klingspor and Gutenberg Musea\r\nhttp://www.klingspor-museum.de/EUeberdasMuseum.html\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg-museum.de/index.php?id=29&L=1\r\n\r\nIf
    you count printing musea, there are quite a few of those in various countries.
    For instance Basel has the Swiss museum for paper, writing and printing, in an
    old paper mill:\r\nhttp://www.papiermuseum.ch/index.php\r\nAnd during ATypI Dublin
    we visited the Irish Printing museum: \r\nhttp://www.nationalprintmuseum.ie/"

    astonished to learn there that the turmoil of the past 50 years in type\u2014hot
    metal to film to digital and then added screen\u2014has been going on since the
    early 19th century. Huge changes have happened regularly, with machinery and even
    professions being outmoded regularly. The Museum of Printing also houses the over
    300,000 drawings from Linotype in the hot metal and pantographic punch cut days,
    which are fascinating.  "
