body: "Hi Guys,\r\nAs a newbie to type creation I'd like to start off on the right
  foot and create fonts that generally cover most languages. (I have a background
  in Graphic Designer and after many years of loving and appreciating all styles of
  fonts, I'd like to have a crack myself)\r\n\r\nMy question is;\r\nIf I was to design
  a typeface and wanted to set off on the correct foot to start with, what would generally
  be the complete character set based around English that also covers the most widely
  used other main languages? (I understand that there are many more Glyphs catering
  for many minor langusges, but if I eventually wanted to sell a font, what would
  be a sufficient Character Set that a Foundry would see as being acceptable for the
  wider market?\r\n\r\nI want to start designing the correct way early in my endevours
  by designing Character Sets that anyone would say is professional and covers the
  major langusges and their respective glyphs. I have looked through FontLab, but
  their 'Encoding' selections look overwhelming.\r\n\r\nA guiding hand, and anyone's
  wisdom would be greatly appreciated.\r\nI have already started looking through these
  fantastic forums and am amazed at the information available.\r\n\r\nI have created
  all forms of Graphics in my time, from the basic business card & tee shirt prints,
  to in-store displays and creating art for Licensed Product all around the world,
  but after many years I've got the bug, and I think there is nothing more beautiful
  in the designing world than a beautiful font!\r\n\r\nThanks for having me, and if
  you could answer my various questions on Character Sets & widely used languages
  that would be great.\r\n\r\nCheers Guys"

  body: I wouldn't worry too much about character sets right know if you have to start
    your first font from scratch. Just select MacOS Roman encoding and do those characters
    first till your utterly happy with them. You can easely extend the font later
    (if we're not talking about Greek or Cyrilic) because a lot of other characters/glyphs
    can be made of components.

    and reference.\r\n\r\nThanks Jos,\r\nJust a quick question on 'MacOS Roman'.\r\nHow
    great is the difference between that encoding and 'MS Windows 1252 Western'.\r\nWill
    I limit myself by using one and not the other?\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: if you're making a cross platform font, you will likely want to include all
    the glyphs from both of those two character sets.

  body: "This is my main post on Latin character sets: http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/08/extended_latin.html\r\n\r\nThere
    are some noticeable differences between MacRoman and WinANSI (codepage 1252).
    For example, Mac includes some ligatures and math symbols Windows leaves out,
    while Windows has some fractions and numeric superiors which Apple ignored.\r\n\r\nThe
    Adobe Latin 2 character set linked from my blog post (see link above) is the union
    of these two key character sets, plus the liter and estimated symbols.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n "

    but with the right information from the start this should give me the correct
    grounding.And being able to download the various Latin Sets is excellent.\r\n\r\nSo
    in a nutshell Thomas, designing to the Adobe Latin 2 Character set to begin with,
    takes in a wider user base and doesn't disadvantage too many people?\r\nEven though
    I'm a newbie to Font Design, would designing to Adobe Latin 2 be seen as a sufficient
    professional set to sell eventually?\r\nI just don't want to become one of those
    nasty free font designers who just releases 26 Upper & Lower case Latin letters,
    numerals and a few punctuation marks.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nJ"

  body: "Yes.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I consider Adobe Latin 2 to be the most basic general-purpose
    cross-platform character set. You could omit liter and estimated, but the rest
    are pretty fundamental.\r\n\r\nNow, that's still limiting yourself to western
    European languages, and sure, it disadvantages hundreds of millions of people
    (even just sticking to Latin based writing systems). It just depends on how much
    work you're willing to do. Adobe Latin 3? etc.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Following on from Thomas's help (and maybe Thomas can answer this)...\r\n\r\nI
    have FontLab Studio 5.\r\nI would like to design a Font to the Adobe Latin 2 Character
    Set.\r\nOn the 'encoding' tab within the Fontlab 5 program I can't seem to find
    the title on the tab for 'Adobe Latin 2' with the full 250 Glyphs.\r\n\r\nI do
    have these two settings \"Adobe OT PS Kerning Subset\" and \"Adobe OT PS Standard
    Names(CFF)\".\r\nDo I select one of these, and do they match the Adobe Latin 2
    Set?\r\n\r\nI have lots of Type 1 settings...and the only encoding that has \"Latin
    2\" in the name is \"ISO 8859-2 Latin 2 (Central Europe)...but that has glyphs
    like 'Tcommaaccent'(0162)which aren't mentioned in the AL-2 Official Character
    Set.\r\n\r\nOther that, I'll have to print out the AL-2 Character Set from Thomas's
    link, print it out and trawl through the encoding tab options FontLab 5 gives
    me.\r\n\r\nHope I'm making sense. Newbie talking.\r\nCheers in advance to anyone
    that can help.\r\nJ"

    http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/latin_charsets/txt/AL2_table.txt\r\n\r\nOpen
    in plain text editor, remove everything but the column containing the glyph names,
    so you end up with a text file with one glyph name in every line and nothing else:\r\n\r\nspace\r\nexclam\r\nquotedbl\r\nnumbersign\r\n...\r\n\r\nThen
    you can add a file header (look in the FontLab encodings folder for examples),
    but be sure to change the name and ID number and put the resulting plain text
    file into the FontLab encodings folder, restart FL and you will find your encoding
    in FontLab's encoding list."

    FontLab 5.\r\n\r\nOne small query.\r\nWhen I go to my new, customized encoding
    setting in FontLab, I have no greyed out view of the '% percent' glyph in that
    box, though all other grey background template glyphs are present.\r\nI checked
    inside my original text file that became this customized set and the word just
    says 'percent'. (It was just 'cut & pasted\" from the AL 2 text link Thomas posted
    here)\r\n\r\nAll other grey glyphs are present, just not '%' (Unicode Character
    0025).\r\nOther Character Set se3tting that came with FontLab show the grey '%'
    symbol.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? \r\nThanks.  "
