<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>What were newspaper typefaces 1890’s to 1920’s used in pre-Linotype, small town papers in western Oregon for headlines, text copy, mastheads & advertising?

Informal project...
---------
Strawberry Labels—Actual or artwork ... see artwork image
---------
Find or design a strawberry crate, barrel or can label to represent 1909 era processors & growers serving Lebanon, Oregon—“Strawberry City” into 1930’s.
----------
Newspaper Articles—Replicate via desktop publishing on a Mac
----------
Create hardcopies of 1890’s-1930’s small town—Lebanon, Oregon—weekly newspaper articles on local strawberry industry using desktop publishing:
--Lebanon Express (mainly Democratic Party), 1887 to present;
--Lebanon Express-Advance (Populist paper), 1890’s until combined with Lebanon Express in 1924;
--Lebanon Criterion (Republican paper), 1898 to 1920’s, known as Linn County Advocate (Jan 1912-Nov 1912)
--Lebanon Tribune, 1912 to unknown (possibly late 1910’s)

<div class=commentbody>Can you get images of any of these papers for us to see? Prior to Linotype, they would have probably used some basic body type from one of the smaller foundries that eventually became part of ATF. I don't recall which individual foundries had offices out west. By the 1920s, at least, ATF had a branch sales office in Portland.
For text, probably something in a Modern or Century vein. For headlines, there are a number of typical faces. Most of these would have gone by pretty mundane descriptive names at the time -- things like Headletter Condensed, Adstyle Headletter, Modern Roman Condensed.
There are a number of faces in the Font Bureau library that are derived from some of these turn-of-the-century headletters. If you want specific recommendations to replicate the Lebanon papers, we'll need some visuals to go off of. Can you print out from microfiche and then scan something in to post?

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for info...
Here are 3 gifs of 1925 Lebanon Express.
Presently working to make earlier edition copies from city library’s microfiche.
In a city of ‘bout 15,000, city library has one microfiche printer—it’s old, doesn’t have good ink = not printing legible copies. Microfiche printer & ink very low city-library priority.
Am working to get donated printer or ink.
Is Block Gothic extra condensed or similar typeface used in “BARRELED BERRIES...” headline?
What is history of such typefaces?
—Thanks Chris

<div class=commentbody>Reference “L” in Lebanon Express masthead...
What is the line with dot on top.
Have a Bitstream Inc. font—Engravers' Old English Bold, Blackletter 781—with same line?

<div class=commentbody>"Barreled Berries" and "Local Strawberries" looks like ATF's Extra Condensed Title Gothic No. 12 to me. Do you mean Red Rooster's Block Gothic? That's got a similar turn-of-the-century headletter gothic feeling. But use all-caps only.
"Christmas 1925" is Cooper from Barnhart Brothers & Spindler. The "mushroomed" serifs are a dead giveaway.
The smaller dark headline looks familiar, but I can't place it offhand. I thought it was ATF Miehle Extra Condensed, but not quite.
"Published Every Wednesday" looks like a Cheltenham.
Hard to say what the text or the subheads are from these lo-res samples. Maybe someone else will want to take a stab at it.
The line in "L" seems to be part of the style. Blackletter is not my area of expertise, so I can't tell you why that element is part of the style.
