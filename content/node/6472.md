  body: I&#39;m going to guess that this is not computer type, because that R doesn&#39;t
    look like anything I&#39;ve seen in the Art Deco fonts I know &#40;of course this
    just might be one I don&#39;t know&#41;, but I&#39;m interested to hear Cameron&#39;s
    answer too. I wish we could get people to give us more background on samples they
    scan. <BR> <BR>There are some other styles that I consider in this mode that you
    can see in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces6.html" target="_blank">Part
    6 of the Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide</a>.
