body: "Hey guys :). This is my first font, i'm not the most skilled person on fontlab,
  but i gave it a try, theres still some issues with kerning and probably spacing,
  but one of the issues that is bugging me a lot is the choppinness of the font and
  size when using it in Illustrator or Photoshop (test run). Any advice's are welcome.
  If needed i can supply the .vfb files.\r\n\r\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/139150/tersia.zip
  \r\n\r\nThx in advance."

  body: "Kerning is waaay too tight.\r\nAll descenders are chopped off - is this intentional?\r\nThe
    choppiness can be minimized by doing two things:\r\n1. In Fontlab, while editting
    a glyph, hit Ctrl+A, right click > Hints > Autohinting\r\nthat should improve
    on-screen quality\r\n2. Select a proper anti-aliasing mode in PS/Illu in the Character
    window (usually crisp or sharp works best)"
