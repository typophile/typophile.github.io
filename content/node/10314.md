  body: Did you investigate using more of a blueprint look? As for the type while
    well set, its boring. You also don&#39;t have anything unified. The top of the
    house looks like clip art, the Initials don&#39;t mean anything. Look at a typeface
    like Eaglefeather based on Frank Lloyd Wrights handwriting. Make the house graphic
    more abstract and make the contact info part of your schematic. A large part of
    custom home design is on interior elements &#40;windows, beamed ceilings etc&#41;
    maybe that imagery would help you. Good start, keep working.

  body: Design critique aside.  <BR> <BR>As far as reproduction, I would be careful
    of this design, depending on it&#39;s intended use. Much of that tiny detail that
    is already getting lost on the web is going to be a blob on anything printed.

  body: I like the way the large HD is holding up the roof and the fact that it&#39;s
    resting on a foundation that spells out Henley Designs. <BR> <BR>That sort of
    says it all to me <BR>   <BR>The smaller HD imho isn&#39;t needed and as Mark
    said would be tough to reproduce. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have any idea how you would
    solve the house being shorter though should you take the wee HD out. <BR> <BR>Best,

  body: In your latest version loose the halftone in the dream balloon it will cause
    problems in smaller sizes &#40;fill in&#41;. My problem with your house is it
    is a specific style of house. If I&#39;m right your client will design any &#34;Dream&#34;
    house. That said look into making the image in the balloon abstract, like a piece
    of a blue print. You don&#39;t need a lot of detail to get the point across. I
    would loose the date and everything but the name. Those are elements that can
    be put in different places based on the layout. You could put the address phone
    etc at the bottom of a letterhead but you will always want the name and the illustration
    to stay together. Keep going!
