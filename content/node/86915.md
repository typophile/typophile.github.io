  are starting in our area.\r\n\r\nThe logo is a representation of D.c, Maryland,
  & Virginia. hence DMV. Here all 3 states are so closely related we refer to it as
  the \"DMV\"\r\nI kept it as simple as i could. The type I was looking for the same
  feel and went w/ a thin italic type for \"'sthemove\" to symbolize a \r\n\"moving
  effect\" or \"on the way\". \r\n\r\nPlease be Hard on me w/ the critique I love
  constructive criticism. lol\r\n\r\nTake care.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/offdmv3_5245.png]"

  body: "It's hard to critique a logo without knowing more about the company it represents.
    \r\n\r\nBut without knowing any background info, my offhand comment is that it
    looks like several different logos rather than one unified logo. The big circle
    overpowers the elements it contains. And \"DMV's the move\" sounds more like a
    tag line rather than part of a logo itself. You need it all to be simpler and
    more direct."

  body: DMV means Department of Motor Vehicles around here, so that is all I thought
    of in the name.  The stars and stripes motif reinforced that governmental idea,
    and the M mark reminded me of racing.  VA looks very tight comparatively and feels
    overly clean and modern next to the rest.  Honestly, I can't even guess what sort
    of organization would be represented by this, so I would go back to the drawing
    board.  What exactly is the message you are trying to send?  What impression should
    this identity create?  What does it have to do with three states?  Who is your
    audience?  etc.
