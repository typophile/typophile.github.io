  I think it was for either Orange mobile phones or Natwest bank. It was very typographic
  with words appearing and moving in time to people talking. They type was set on
  a black and white background. THis is all I can remember and I cant remember who
  designed it, I have a feeling it was The Chase but am not sure, \r\n\r\nANy ideas\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nM"
