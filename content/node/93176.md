  670 (Audio compressor) logo (the \"Fairchild\" part)?\r\n\r\nAlthough the attached
  picture shows rounded corners (due to picture resolution), I'm pretty sure the characters
  have squared ends.\r\n\r\nPicture uploaded.\r\n\r\nMore images here: [[http://www.diy-racked.com/diy-talk/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=128]]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help."

    looks to be standard Leroy\xAE template lettering, obliqued, with a custom /F\u2026\r\n\r\nSame

    from the age of mechanical lettering.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I also came up with
    this possibility:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/642855/PredicateStdRoundedItalic-product.html\r\n\r\nKind
