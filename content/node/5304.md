  body: There&#39;s a company called Ideazon that&#39;s created something called the
    <a href="http://www.hothardware.com/hh_files/S&amp;V/ideazon_keyboard.shtml">the
    Zboard</a>, in a practical variation on this idea. It&#39;s essentially a keyboard-like
    base which can accomodate interchangeable faces that use application-specific
    labels &#40;and even keys&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, you can have a Photoshop keyboard
    and a Medal of Honor &#40;a videogame&#41; keyboard, etc. The shapes of the buttons
    themselves also vary, based on what the applications&#39; keyboard usage techniques
    involve. <BR> <BR>In its current form, it&#39;s not directly related to typesetting,
    but I&#39;m sure someone could develop an InDesign digital typsetting or  font-specific
