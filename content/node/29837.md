body: "We are casting our nets far and wide for an <strong>Art Director</strong> to
  join us.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for someone with more than five years professional
  experience working as both as a thought leader and a supporting teammate. You are
  dedicated to honing your skills and playing to your strengths. Good things don\u2019t
  just come to you, you earn them. And people take notice. Your portfolio reflects
  conceptual development, strategic thinking, typographic sensitivity and visual pacing.
  You are comfortable working across print and digital, and everything in-between,
  and understand working with strong established brands. You have the client\u2019s
  best interests at heart and are dedicated to making them successful. \r\n\r\nYou
  thrive in a strong collaborative environment, and understand when to lead, when
  to follow, when to champion your own ideas, and when to champion others\u2019. You
  are a creative leader and you understand how to educate and partner with our clients,
  how to make your teammates around you better, and to look for mentoring opportunities
  to grow and improve the team.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Visionaries. Role Models. Educators.
  Teammates.</strong>\r\n\r\nFive words that tell you about opus:creative, our philosophy,
  the people that work here and our approach to the relationships we have with our
  clients.\r\n\r\nWe've been recognized by Oregon Business Magazine for the last four
  years as one of the best small companies to work for in Oregon. We heartily agree.
  \r\n\r\nPlease send portfolio, r\xE9sum\xE9, and a short essay that tells us why
  you are our next art director to:  careers@opuscreative.com (please direct your
  email to Jason Sherwood in the subject line)\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.\r\nwww.opuscreative.com\r\n\r\n\r\nPS
  - Thanks Joe P. for recommending the forum for this.\r\n"

    body: "Why do you use more than one question mark at the end of sentences?\r\n\r\nSeriously
      though, a thought leader is someone doesn't need or want everything spelled
      out for them. Someone who can lead our clients through strategic innovation.
      Someone our clients trust and rely on for guidance.\r\n\r\nAs for the essay,
      we didn't feel like a word count was necessary.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of
      answering the \"best small companies\" question The quantitative answer can
      be found here: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.oregonbusiness.com/.docs/_sid/2bc33d599e86fb9fd0d3cd1eb7488cb5/action/detail/rid/10790/pg/10003\r\n\r\nFor
      me though, it is something more emotional. I love what I do. I love who I work
      with.\r\n\r\nThanks and good luck to you as well.\r\n\r\nJ."
