  body: I'm happy to be wrong, but I think Univers is too stark and Centaur too delicate.

  body: "I'm not certain FontHaus's Metro is the best. <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/215/metroseries.html\">Linotype's
    original Metro</a> is probably the most authentic digitization, if that's what
    you're shooting for. The reason you may have missed it is that its three styles
    have one word names -- <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/metrolite_no_2_roman/\">Metrolite</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/metromedium_no_2_roman/\">Metromedium</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/metroblack_no_2_roman/\">Metroblack</a>\_--
    so they don't always appear in searches for \"Metro\"."

  body: "What would a sans version of Centaur look  like one wonders? IT would have
    to have a calligraphic influence and a small x-height. Just thinking out loud
    really. It would have to have old style numerals. \r\n\r\nOK When Bruce Rogers
    designed Centaur he worked directly with a broad pen over bleached out enlargements
    of the a 15th century typeface by Nicholas Jenson. So ITC Legacy Sans is also
    based on Jensons letters perhaps would this be worth trying. It does look a little
    wide for headlines though. Is it for a magazine?"
