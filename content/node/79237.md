  body: "I was wondering the same thing. It looks like a modified version of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr/bold-extra-condensed/|RR
    Block Gothic Bold Extra-Condensed]] (or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr/extra-bold-extra-condensed/|Extra-Bold
    Extra-Condensed]]) with the M\u2019s crotch truncated, the G\u2019s bar chopped,
    and terminals cut to slant. That\u2019s the closest thing I can think of, anyway."
