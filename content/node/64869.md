  body: "A question for the group; I just received an email from the conference informing
    me that they have created an account for me on their \"social media site.\"\r\n\r\nI
    have not signed up, registered, or provided them with contact information of any
    kind.\r\n\r\nIt appears as though you cannot access this site without first receiving
    an invitation or creating an account.\r\n\r\nI am wondering if anyone else got
    an invitation like this under similar circumstances?"
