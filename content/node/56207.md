body: "I'm a web designer with low level PHP skills. I'm also a budding type designer.
  Somehow, I have to convince my boss that it is a good idea for me to learn [[Python]].
  \r\n\r\nSo my question is, aside from using the Django frameworks which I am already
  tentatively working with, what else could I possibly use as an argument to let me
  spend company time learning Python? Specifically, what can I do with it that will
  best build the skills needed to use Python effectively in working specifically with
  type, but also are productive for Python use in general?"

    beginning with Python.

  body: FontForge is scriptable with Python. Don't know anything about it beyond that,
    but I'd like to learn too. That one might be <em>too</em> type specific for your
    immediate needs though.

  body: "Learning to properly use FontForge is also a goal of mine, so that's not
    too far out of place.\r\n\r\nLearning the basics of scripting is what I need to
    do, I guess. I'm not too familiar with creating _any_ kind of scripting, aside
    from some relatively minor PHP or jQuery."
