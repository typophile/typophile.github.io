  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi folks, new to the forum, but consider myself a neophyte type snob (that is, still a beginner, but I am a type nut nonetheless).
I am a student, and purchased the Adobe Font Folio (academic), so I already own such faces as Helvetica, Avenir, Univers, Futura, etc etc,plus the faces that come with OS X and Adobe CS4.

What I lack is a really complete slab-serif family of fonts. I am thinking that purchasing a good slab-serif font would be a really useful addition to my library, so I am currently considering Jos' Museo Slab family or H&FJ's Archer. I see Archer everywhere, however, and I don't want to invest in a library that could soon be ubiquitous/overused (if it isn't already...)

Other faces I'm considering: Gotham, Verlag, some nice brush scripts like Alpine Script... maybe a combination of fonts. However, I can only afford spending up to <b>$300 on fonts.</b> I see the merit in getting one high-quality family (or at least a subset of a family) and learning how to use it really well.

I'd really appreciate your feedback!</div>

If you are looking for a slab serif family, you could take a look of my Suomi Slab Serif. It has six weights with italics. From MyFonts. This is shameless self-promotion, but there you go.

(Hmmm, or are you simply following a trend? :-)

If you're not in a huge rush, I would suggest waiting just
a little bit: there will soon be a very nice one coming out.
It's warm, well-crafted, covers 50+ languages, and the
italic is impressively progressive.

But really, first we need to narrow things down: what flavor of
slab are you looking for? There are kiddie ones, industrial ones...

		<div class="commentbody">I think Hrant is on target in asking what kind of slab you are looking for, because they can be so different. For a happy sans you can't do better than Museo, and a friendly one, Archer. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pmn-caecilia/|PMN Caecilia]] is a humanist slab, very nice for some clean looking text. The heavy condensed weights of [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Dispatch|Dispatch]] look great in headlines, for which they were designed. [[http://www.seblester.co.uk/type_lettering.php?CategoryId=7|Soho]]'s heavy weights are pretty, and somehow say 'magazine' more to me. Newsy, but very stylish is [[http://christianschwartz.com/stagsans.shtml|Stag]], which is my favorite at the moment.

		<div class="commentbody">I have looked through all the suggestions and I will try to answer some of your questions. I confess, I do not quite understand all the nuances between styles of slab-serif. In terms of pure subjective taste, I prefer slabs that are more geometric, with very little contrast between thick/thin strokes, which Museo and Archer seem to fit quite well. I stumbled across House Industries' Neutraface Slab last night, and am really considering that or Neutraface No 2.

I like The Serif from LucasFonts, but it feels awfully similar to Chaparral to me, which I own, and I'm looking for building up as much diversity in my font library as possible. On my sticky note of serious considerations, I now have the following: <b>Archer, Museo Slab, Neutraface Slab, Neutraface 2, and Gotham.</b>

I'm delighted to see you frequent these forums, Jos! I feel like I've stumbled upon a goldmine of knowledge and expertise. I myself am designing a geometric slab-serif... which may not turn out to be any good, but I am learning a ton in the process. Part of the reason I want to purchase a geometric slab is for study purposes.</div>

Type design can only be mastered by exercising it a lot together with looking a lot at your own and other designs. Because Museo Slab 500 and 500 italic are already free you might want to opt for Archer or something else. That way you have more material to reference to :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It is obviously advantageous to have a diverse library in itself, but making choices will be easier if you have a better idea of what typefaces you will need for your projects. So you may consider setting aside a typeface budget, so that when a project comes along for which you need something other than what you have in your current library, you can choose to buy one tailored for that project. You can build up your library organically that way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tomi, it is widely considered bad form to post several times in quick succession in a thread. So try to contain your thoughts to one post at a time. You may add a second post only if you have a substantial addition to make. But if you just want to add one more sentence right after you've posted something, use the edit button and add it to your last post; if you do it quickly enough, your post won't even be marked as edited.

I know this is not perhaps an immediately obvious rule, but not to follow it may turn people against you unnecessarily.</div>

Tomi from Suomi—...all the Finnish beer can packaging makes me think of fond trips to Finland. And makes me thirsty. Nice type.

I'd always just assumed the "III" or "IV" on beer cans like Lapin Kulta, Karhu and Karjala had to do with the percentage alcohol content. (I suppose in a roundabout taxation way, it does). 

I do recall once being told, in that dry Finnish way, that the "Lapin Kulta" brand of beer translates directly into english as "Reindeer Piss."</div>

You hijacked this forum and selfishly loaded it down with large images and essentially irrelevant self-promotion. You've secured your position on my own personal black list, no matter the quality (or lack thereof) of your work. True, I'm just one designer, and irritating me won't impact your bottom line, but I would suggest exercising a bit more class in your future forum posts.

		<div class="commentbody">Brendan, I am right now reading the monumental "Adrian Frutiger Typefaces. The Complete Works". In the discussion of his slab serif, Serifa, there is a wonderful classification of slab serifs on p. 168. It's a classification by structure and really gives a lot of insight into the form. If you are going to work on a slab serif I would definitely recommend having a look at it in a library. Interestingly, Frutiger regards Serifa as "one of my worst attempts at a typeface."</div>

"Serifa is one of my worst attempts at a typeface, I think it's fair to say. Not because of the characters that were unusual for me [he notes these earlier], but because my idea of a constructivist slab serif face was wrong for the eye. I always wanted to make readable faces. And Serifa just isn't comfortable to read, it doesn't flow well enough because of its wide fit. One could use it for posters. Serifa is pretty meaningless and yet it endures. That's the tragic thing about typefaces, they stick around and always will. Once you design one you have to be able to stand by it." </div>
