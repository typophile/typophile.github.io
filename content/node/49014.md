  many of the books come from estates of the many elderly women in the neighborhood
  who spend their final years in a decrepit old mansion before dying, leaving behind
  a house full of junk that smells of mold, mothballs, and cat urine. Their books
  are rarely anything special, so they tend to get unceremoniously dumped on the discount
  tables outside. I can walk up to these tables and learn about the latest deaths
  in my neighborhood. \r\n\r\nLast week it was apparently an old German woman with
  a thing for painters and the modernism that sprung from the Vienna secessionists. "

    Did you buy anything of this mitteleuropean material?

    how much better the printing is these days. That and I\u2019ve run out of shelf
    space and started shelving two deep!"

    take some fifty something years.

    put another four shelves up. I look forward (someday) to my own decrepit mansion,
    populated by old books and felines!"
