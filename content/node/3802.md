    our office since the dawn of time and obviously, we don&#39;t know what the deal
    is license-wise... quite possibly, my partner bought it on eBay... <BR> <BR>would
    it be inappropriate/illegal for me to offer to email Kate the font, should she
    be unable to otherwise acquire it?

    wants it, mail me, with the proviso of course that if we ever find out there is
    a legitimate rightsholder, all the right things will be done. As there is so little
    information available, it seems unlikely. The copyright info lists \"Novel Fonts!
    Corporation\" (exclamation not excluded). This appears to be a very difficult-to-find

  body: It's in the mail. Isn't it astounding that nobody knows its provenance? I
    wish I still had a working copy of Font Chameleon - - I swear it's an interpolation
    of Times and Meridien. As I said before, the digitization is most remarkably clean,
    adding to the mystery.

  body: "I remember the \"Expresiv Fonts\" collections from the mid-90s. They were
    at least two, and perhaps three or more, all of pretty poor quality as I recall
    (and certainly this one bears that out). I have a vague recollection of examining
    them for a project I was considering in late 1994 or early 1995 involving cataloging
    knockoffs. (Which I abandoned for several reasons, including that such information
    could be used for evil as well as good.)\r\n\r\nA little checking shows that FontChameleon
    1.0 was getting reviewed in May 1994, so dates seem about right. However, in the
    sample shown above, the lack of overshoot, the exaggerated serif length, the serif
    shapes, and the \"jiggly\" tops of certain letters are all inconsistent with the
    results of using FontChameleon in the process of creating the font. Remember,
    FontChameleon would blend *all* the features at the elemental/particulate level,
    not just take some features from each of the two fonts. This is much more like
    the latter approach.\r\n\r\nSome of the features could have been done by taking
    something output from FontChameleon and then doing lots of editing... but you
    wouldn't likely lose the overshoots of the rounds that way. So, I think it's just
    a badly executed font. (Not that the concept was necessarily bad... can't remember
    if this sort of thing had already been done to death back then.)\r\n\r\nI must
    get to sleep now.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: Thomas is right, I have been trying to remember what Chameleon blends were
    like, and it is true that you would never get these effects. I wish we could all
    play with Chameleon again, I shall have to set up a Win95/98 machine or something.
    It's amazing how tasteful the results are -- and how ultimately useless. Does
    anyone remember if Chameleon 2 was ever released, with ascender/descender control?
    I don't think I ever had that version. So could this be the result of a simple
    PS blend? Perpetua and Modern? (grasping at straws) -- or what about some of the
    neat built-in and programmable effects in Fontlab 2/2.5?

  body: "Thread drift!\r\n\r\nI am not sure about Chameleon 2... I might be confusing
    it in my head with 1.5 which was definitely released. That's the version which
    added italics support. But neither David nor I remembers a later version of the
    retail product being on the market.\r\n\r\n(Side note: internally in the Chameleon
    editor the way the italics worked was kinda whack. They were actually edited in
    upright form, and then slanted at the last minute. This was pretty workable for
    trying to make an italic that imitated an existing \"normal\" font because you'd
    start by unslanting it and sticking it in the background. But if you wanted to
    use Chameleon as a means of creating a new design, well, it was a pretty bizarre
    way to work with your italics.)\r\n\r\nT"
