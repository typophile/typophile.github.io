  body: "These are letters made  by sign companies for use by small businesses. They
    are not based on a font as such. The 3d molding gives stability to plastic letters.\r\nI
    can't find any digital fonts that both match the narrow constructivist/gas-pipe
    design of the letterforms and the embossed effect. The closest 3d fonts where
    both the _S_ and the _R_ match this design are Prismatiq JNL [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PrismatiqJNLAsNOW_5957.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/prismatiq/ and Theatrics JNL [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TheatricsJNLAsNOW_4805.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/theatrics/ but both are too wide.\r\nNon
    prismatic/embossed fonts with generally matching letterforms and narrower width
    include Linotype Case Study No One[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CaseStudyNoOneAsNOW_4329.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/case-study-no-one-lt/\r\nFonts with closer
    match to the width but some mismatch in _S_ or _R_ include Komu A [img:sites/default/files/old-images/KomuAAsNOW_5666.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dizajndesign/komu/\r\nDharma Gothic Bold \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DharmaGothicBoldAsNOW_5769.gif]

  body: "Thanks Old Nick.\r\n\r\nDon, really appreciate your recommendations. Interesting
    to see how nothing is an exact match.\r\nI've struggled and finally gave up. This
    is so helpful.\r\nBest,\r\nMara "
