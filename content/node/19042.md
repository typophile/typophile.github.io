  body: The grunge effects were applied to this after setting the type, but if you
    want a worn Franklin Gothic out of the box, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=TO.6660.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=sfollati&sampleSize=48">Frankie</a>
    is an option.
