body: "I claim to have a world record in type design in speed.\r\n\r\nWhen House Industries
  guys went about their Font Sprint in Vancouver, I promised I would trump their attempt
  of producing a working font in under 4 hours. They failed miserabily; they had upper
  and lower case letters, and most of the numerals.\r\n\r\nI promised that if ATypI
  ever came to Helsinki, I would make a whole font in that time.\r\n\r\nATypI did
  come to Helsinki, so I had to put my money where my mouth was, and since I was one
  of the organizers, I could. This is the result:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Marathon_4566.png]\r\nIt
  is ugly as hell, but it's a working Open Type font with 122 kerning pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  made a RoboFog-file with pre-demernied x-height, ascenders and descenders beforehand,
  but that was it. Everything else was made on site. From start to this pdf, it took
  me 3 hours 4 minutes.\r\n\r\nChallenge?"

  body: Truly impressive. A testament to technology and craft. With that said, I'm
    not a fan of bashing House, or showing off. But with a skill like type design
    speed, where else could you do it but here?

  body: "Hi, James-\r\n\r\nI was not bashing House; I know them, and consider them
    friends of mine. But Ken, Christian and Tal did admit that they did not manage
    the task in time. And so, with help of some amount of red wine, I promised them
    that if ATypI ever came to Helsinki, I would try to make a whole Latin 1 font
    in 4 hours. \r\n\r\nAnd look what happened.\r\n\r\nAnd I quess I was showing off.
    Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nBut then again, I made a full font in 3 hours and 4 minutes
