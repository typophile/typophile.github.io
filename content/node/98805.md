  body: "If you are on a Mac or on linux and if you want a fontforge script to execute
    from the command line, then save the lines\r\n<PRE>\r\nOpen($1)\r\nSelectWorthOutputting()\r\nExport(\"eps\")\r\n</PRE>\r\nto
    some file, say <code>expglyphs.pe</code> and then the call\r\n<PRE>\r\nfontforge
    -lang=ff -script expglyphs.pe &lt;fontfile&gt;\r\n</PRE>\r\nshould give you one
    eps file for each glyph in the font.\r\n\r\nElse  you probably want a script to
    call from within FontForge using <code>File > Execute Script > FF</code>:  in
    that case, remove the first line from the script above. You could also select
    the glyphs to output using the user interface instead of a script; you then need
    only the line <code>Export(\"eps\")</code> or simply type <code>Export(\"eps\")</code>
    directly in the little window that appears when you select <code>File > Execute
    Script > FF</code>.\r\n \r\nAdded: with the extension .pe, the script is properly
    listed when you click on ... in <code>Files > Preferences > Script Menu</code>
    and you can then easily add it to <code>Files > Script Menu</code>"
