  over the last little while one of my pet product projects is doing a series of candle
  guards. This one here is the prototype of my XOX candle guard. \r\n\r\nBlack letter
  would be extremely awesome (especially in the shadows), but for now I'm just trying
  out this letter shape loosely based on a cut of Kabel.\r\n\r\nThought I'd share...\r\n\r\n"

    will\r\ntrip over themselves to sell 'em. You might even try to get\r\na patent
    on the idea of casting shadows of words in this way.\r\n\r\nI once had the idea
    of lampshades that do that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    would only be legible as such in the shadow, not the object itself. Kind of like
    those old anamorphotic paintings... hmm\r\n\r\nAnd, hell yeah blackletter. Shadow
    textura? Sign me up."

  body: "William, now I'm wondering if the melting wax could\r\nsomehow be made to
    form letters, or even the stencil\r\nso that the message would change over time!\r\n\r\nNina,
    I think you could do that simply by making the\r\nheights of the flame and the
    lettering very different.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for all your awesome comments! Coolio linkage too.\r\n\r\nNext step
    will be cutting the steel (using water jet), roll it up, take it over to powder
    coat and then set into my fresh new old skool-esque candle holder. I'll post it
    up when done.\r\n\r\nI'll try to do one in glass but no promises on that.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
