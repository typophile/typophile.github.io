  body: "I am starting to think that the two words are in different versions of Helvetica.
    It seems to work if I do tile in Light Condensed and Bath in Light. But that is
    till not exactly it. The B and H seem to be wider than all the condensed type
    faces I have tried. However I definitely find better matches for the A and T with
    condensed faces.\r\n\r\nDuncan"
