    Gothic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-gothic/\">Engravers'
    Gothic</a> are starts, but they're just close.\r\n\r\nI have a feeling since it's
    for a company, it's a custom face that's just really close to most Gothics --
    there's just something about that G glyph that doesn't seem like it fits."

    because flash 8 lets you have a progress bar, doesn't require you to pop up another
    browser window, provides more consistent client-side file-type and upload size
    feedback (so you don't have to upload the entire file to the server to find out
    that it's too big), and besides, I wanted to try out some new flash 8 stuff. *wink*
    There's more on the way. Think sweet TypeID board */wink*"
