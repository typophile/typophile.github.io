  \  I'm a Brazilian designer looking for old examples os latin sanserif letters.
  Above is the only example I\xB4ve found, used for Optima. Does anyone have more
  pictures?\r\n\r\n   I am specially curious about the faces pointed in these lines:\r\n\r\n
  \  \"Perhaps it is no more than an accident of history that the unserifed letters
  of the fifteenth century Florentine architects and sculptors were not translated
  into metal type in the 1470s.\" - Bringhurst, Elements of Typographic Style.\r\n\r\nI
  have already searched for Brunelleschi's and some other architects' handwriting,
  without success.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\n\r\nJeansou."
