body: I'd like to direct my customers to current information about which current browsers
  support OpenType features. I think class based kerning and default ligatures (liga)
  features are supported by some browsers but I'm not sure which ones. Is someone
  keeping score?

    extensions for Safari and Chrome to set \"rendering:optimizeLegibility\" for every

  body: "The point of the CALT feature is to improve the text display for certain
    letter combinations. So turning it on by default is the recommended behavior\_\u2013

  body: <code>calt</code> should be on by default, if your font is using it for a
    non-default substitution, then you are using the wrong feature tag (note, the
    substitution can still be contextual but under a different tag, e.g. <code>dlig</code>,
    this is very legitimate).

    open type features in web browser, and since the source code is available (here

    can easily modify it to add more features for more complex testing"
