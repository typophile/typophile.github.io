body: I have heads which are intestate regular all caps. which is nice. however, interstate
  does not work well as body copy. what would you recommend that looks like interstate
  but works as body copy. it will be large body copy like 24 pt.

  body: At 24 pt even Interstate should work as body copy. No? Did you try it?

    on the side of the cliff for them to read as they crash to the ground below.\r\n\r\noh,
    the copy is readable. its just that interstate was not developed to carry large
    amounts of copy...and if there is a font that is similar but more friendly towards
    large amounts of copy."

  body: I have set Interstate as headers with Baskerville before and it comes out
    looking great. It was identity work for a hotel, if that matters =)

  body: full 8.5 x 11 page with .375" margin. i'm looking for this part of the piece
    to have a certain amount of tension. so i like the interstate (sans serif) for
    that with the small margins.

  body: 24 pt. could be right for the fine print on a parking lot towing sign, but
    even then that sounds pretty small. I can't think of a lot of places where 24
    pt. type would be considered "body copy", but that's one. I remember doing a large
    copy-heavy park rules sign, but I think that got no smaller than 64 pt.

  body: "24 pt on a letter-sized page, AND headlines? That doesn't leave you with
    much space to work with. \r\n\r\n<cite>i\u2019m looking for this part of the piece
    to have a certain amount of tension</cite>\r\n\r\nI would think that Interstate
    would make the perfect body text to add tension, precisely because it is NOT designed
    for text. But at 24 pt, you could use Hobo for body copy and it would still be
    workable."

  body: "\"...interstate was not developed to carry large amounts of copy...\"\r\nLarge
    amounts of copy at 24 pt. for the chosen line length will work with the right
    leading and word space. There is a huge x-ht, generous counters and spacing. .
    . If I did anything to improve it for this purpose, I'd add long(er) descenders
    and perhaps an additional g, for when more leading was desired than these short
    descenders can 'take up', and for better recognition, respectively.\r\n\r\nOr
    show me/us what you mean, because I think your 'certain amount of tension' is
    the kind of body text Interstate is famous for in 40 styles. :)\r\n\r\nCheers!"
