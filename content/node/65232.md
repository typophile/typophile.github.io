  an idea that we'd love to get your feedback on.\r\n\r\nHow would you feel if incoming
  Type IDs were pre-sorted into font classifications? \r\n\r\nPotential categories
  could be:\r\n\r\n- SANS\r\n- SERIF\r\n- SCRIPT\r\n- DISPLAY\r\n- BLACKLETTER\r\n\r\nWould
  this be helpful? More appealing? Overcomplicating things? Let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I don't think it's necessary. I would really love it, though, if on the "tracker"
    page it said "Type ID Board" instead of "Forum Topic" in the column on the left.
    That "Forum Topic" label is completely useless as it is. Practically everything
    is a "Forum Topic".

  body: "I think it would overcomplicate things. Most of the people asking for Type
    IDs aren't very knowledgeable about type (which is why they're here in the first
    place), so I can see a lot of requests being miscategorized.\r\n\r\nPlus, I don't
    want to have to check five separate places to do IDs.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like
    is the \"Next Thread\" and \"Previous Thread\" links back (lost in the previous
    redesign).\r\n\r\nAlso, maybe include some help text next to the \"Title\" field
    when creating new threads to help minimize the \"ID THIS FONT PLEASE!!!\" titles.\r\n\r\n

  body: "What Mark and Lex said. Categories won\u2019t help (even a distinction of
    sans and serif seems to be too tough for some of our guests). They even would
    slow down things, as we then had to go through various index pages.\r\n\r\nBetter
    (= distinguishable, ideally descriptive) thread titles would be a real improvement.
    For the guidelines: There used to be a sticky post with <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/\">FAQ</a>
    (which nobody actually read). They included this paragraph:\r\n\r\nWhat do I enter
    in the \u201CTitle\u201D line?\r\nTry to define your type ID request as clearly
    as possible. For example <em>\u201C1960\u2019s newspaper headline face\u201D</em>
    or <em>\u201CLost in Translation movie logo\u201D</em> or <em>\u201Cretro script\u201D</em>
    will do nicely. Whereas <em>\u201CPlease help me identify this font\u201D</em>
    is pretty pointless as that\u2019s the only thing we do on the Type Identification
    Board. Compare it to a newspaper where every single headline would say <em>\u201CStuff
    happened!\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nF\r\n "
