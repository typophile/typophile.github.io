body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nHad originally created a logo for a ficticious record label
  called \"Fire\" but decided to take the project further by doing a whole typeface.
  (Done in Illustrator.) It's a work in progress as I've literally spent a couple
  of days on the lowercase characters.\r\n\r\nIf you image I started with F I R and
  E, these were made from quarter circles / half arches, depending on what you want
  to called them. Anyway, the logo looked quite effective (see attached image) so
  I continue to use the original shapes plus some straight lines.\r\n\r\nI've tried
  not to be too traditional with X-height - the C and E are good examples. The idea
  is to try and keep the characters as clean and simple as possible. I ran into problems
  creating a effective S, T and Z... I'm quite happy with the S and T now, but the
  Z isn't quite right - it doens't look at all right... I'm tempted to go for a simple
  X-height version, but ideally I wanted it to have a descender, like the C and E.
  I'm also considering losing the dots off the I and J (as the original Fire logo
  didn't have this.)\r\n\r\nAnyway let me know what you like, don't like about it.
  Would like to finish the l/c before I even attempt the u/c set.\r\n\r\nFor numbered
  characters, I was thinking to ditch the traditional idea of English/Mathematical
  numbers, but to replace with digits or even just the words: EG: \"3\" would be \"three\"
  or \"...\" - that way 131 would be: \"onethreeone\" or \". ... .\"\r\n\r\nI wish
  I was a student again, I'd have ore time, but would lack money![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fire-Text_5007.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fire-Logo_4727.gif]"

  body: "I think it is a little difficult to read the word \"fire\", I think it is
    because the F, and although I like the general appereance of the typography, have
    you tried to write some words to balance if you like the way they look? Sorry
    for my English.\r\n"

  body: "D'oh - sorry Paul - they were a little large weren't they!?! (Does my lack
    of design-for-web come to light now?)\r\n\r\nHopefully these will look better...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fire-Logo_6062.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fire-Text_3466.gif]\r\n\r\nSo
    the F is causing problems? I kind of like the way it \"techinically\" is an F
    despite it's lack of descender. The text doesn't particularly have to be legible
    at 8pt, as it's more a club/flyer orientated display font. I've put some word
    together and like it but stick need to try it out as a proper font (i.e converted
    via Fontographer, which I still need to buy!)"

    about the e, f and s that doesn''t seem to connect with the rest of the lettershapes.
    That p is great though. '

  body: "Cool, cheers for the feedback Asvetic.\r\n\r\nThe Z was bothering me, too,
    so I've changed to a smaller version. I see what you mean about the X and the
    S.\r\n\r\nIn regards to the E and F - these were literaly two characters I started
    with, so the idea was to keep them as they are. But saying that, I see why people
    would view them with some concern. So what I'm thinking about now is to create
    some alternative lower case characters... I'll stick a new post on here soon.\r\n\r\nCheers,

  body: "Hey this is looking alot better. I like that first \"f\", something about
    that descender is nice. You might want to carry that look into the \"t\" and the
    \"j\". I see you reworked the \"e\" and the \"s\" as well, while the letterforms
    are much more consistant with the rest of the alphabet, they still seem unfinished.
    Both have a compressed look (as if smushed from the top down.) The \"s\" is definitely
    too wide as well. I know you're trying to make every character unique, I think
    in this instance, you might have to give up and go with a more traditional look
    to these characters (follow?) \r\n\r\nAs far as the Capitals. I'm not really feeling
    the majority of these at all. Most of them look like you took the lowercase letters
    and extended them or resized and compressed them. While they're not all horrible,
    I think this might need some new attention. \r\n\r\nI'm still very impressed with
    the look. This will be a fun font when you're finished. Keep at it. "

  body: "Now you're talking!\r\nThe new version is a vast improvement in legibility
    & could even work for longer texts.\r\nIt's good however that you've kept the
    alternatives & added some more (the lowercase g alternative is very nice).\r\nThe
    uppercase G looks a little condensed compared to the rest, maybe it might be better
    to put the bar on the right side?"

  body: "Russ -\r\n\r\n     I really like this type face, although its definetly not
    a complete system yet and you should push it further. I know Im coming into this
    discussion late as its December now and you all havent posted since August but
    keep up the interesting work! \r\n\r\n   A couple quick suggestions:\r\n\r\n    -
    have you investigated what a rounded terminal would do for some of the characters?\r\n
    \   - try adding a curling descender to certain letters (k, m, n, etc) like on
    your 'y' but with an exaggerated curl?\r\n    - Your caps do seem condensed, also
    the B and R have akward bowl shapes, I would reccomend incorporating a look similr
    to the g, p, q\r\n\r\n    Im really into this typeface, creating an entire type
    face is no small task, keep going. I think your number/lettering concept was interesting;
    kind of out there...have you looked into old numerals with offset baselines? I
    think you may be apt to follow that route as your descenders are already breaking
    ground so to speak, I would love to see that carry over into the numerals.\r\n\r\n~
