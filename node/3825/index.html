Looks good as far as I see, but the lc 's' seem a little bit thin than the other lc. Maybe you need to make it more fat. <BR>2. I don't understand why the 3,4,5 looks narrower than the other. <BR>3. I like the way you treat the curve on lc 'g'. <BR>4. The uc looks fine. <BR> <BR>I guess that's all from me. Guys any comment? <BR>Sorry about my bad English. <BR> <BR>+ep+</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would reduce the word spaces down to at least half what they are now.  <BR> <BR>Also, I think the baseline is unnaturally even for a style like this. I would let it vary about the same amount as the x-height. A good way to think about it is to imagine an invisible line about halfway up the x-height. The lowercase letters should appear to be bouncing slightly up and down from this line. Right now, it looks like they are all sitting solidly on the baseline which fights against the lively, unhinged quality of the font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kerning pairs are meant to fix horizontal spacing anomalies (too much/little space between glyphs, like between the &quot;Ty&quot; pair), so they benefit from linguistics too (although arguably less); but kerning pairs are not inherently related to the &quot;bumping&quot; as far as I can think. <BR> <BR>A good source? Cryptanalisis/cryptography. I use some books I have, but here's the top Google hit for &quot;cryptanalysis digraphs&quot;: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~umich/fm-34-40-2/" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.umich.edu/~umich/fm-34-40-2/">http://www.umich.edu/~umich/fm-34-40-2/</a></A> <BR>(Appendix A and on.) <BR> <BR>BTW, you can/should also look at the most frequent *words* (which will quickly show you the most serious problematic situations), and for the top 100 in English you can look at the far right of: <BR><A HREF="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/s_quality.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/s_quality.html">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/s_quality.html</a></A> <BR> <BR>But frequency is only part of the picture. There are very many words that are not common but do cause unfortunate spacing - &quot;spikes&quot; in language; which is why most type designers use long premade/canned lists of pairs/words to check their work. I wouldn't worry about those for your &quot;bumpiness&quot; (since things have to average out anyway), but for the &quot;higher reaches&quot; of spacing (where adding a kerning pair doesn't hurt anything else) you need that too. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
