  body: Well, actually the glyphs ARE the same. Could still be handdrawn and glyphs
    dublicated.

    11, that's so evident! (Or maybe some OpenType programming genius has been doing

    typehype should be a little more specific next time."

  body: I think Jan is right - typehype wants to know the shadowed font. I know it
    from somewhere. A free thing, if I recall right.

  body: How can be the spacing between two same pairs are different? Also if you compare
    all the E's you'll spot the difference. Since whole calendar is hand drawn, I
    believe its not a typeface. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/aaaaaaaaa_4613.jpg]

    is not as compressed, but it has more of the hand-drawn look. You could screw
    around with the tracking to alter letterspacing like this too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
