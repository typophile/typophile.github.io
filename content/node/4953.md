body: I am a designer...I&#39;m looking to update my collection of typefaces. Right
  now I just have a dated collection from Corel 6...as well as some others. But, I
  would really like some that have a more contemporary look. Where can I buy such
  a collection that includes all different kinds including formal, etc... ??
