  but I can't seem to find it anywhere. Thought I saw a similar font on dafont.com
  but now it's no where to be found.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n- Z."

    collage artist and designer Eduardo Recife. You can find his font's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/person/Eduardo_Recife/\">here</a>,
    also check his website at <a href=\"http://www.misprintedtype.com/v4/\">www.misprintedtype.com</a>.
    Some fonts are free and you could find them in handy.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://origin.myfonts.net/116/fs/u/db/147460e077d6426d9dddd0c8b2114a.gif\"

  body: "Thank you both for you suggestions.\r\n\r\nI still have not been able to
    find this particular \"font.\" So it may indeed be hand-drawn, but I still doubt
    it given its source.\r\n\r\n- Z."
