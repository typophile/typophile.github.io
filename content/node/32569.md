body: "Hello\r\nI am trying to use and employer's collection of Univers. There are
  about 30 different individual files, varying by weight and width. Unfortunately
  they have numbers instead of names (\"Univers 57\") and I can't really tell which
  goes with what in regard to the width. There seems to be at least 4 widths of fairly
  subtle differences (although I'm sure people on here could tell the difference without
  much problem.)\r\nWhy would these be numbered instead of named? Is there some logic
  to the numbering system I'm not getting? The numbers start at 39 and go up to 86,
  but there are many missing numbers along the way. Does anyone know of a chart I
  could look at that sorts these out by number into categories?\r\n\r\nSorry if my
  long rambling nessage is boring, but I would appreciate any help you can give me.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: That is a new system. The Platinum Collection's "Linotype Univers" has many
    more weights than the original "Univers" that Frutiger created with Deberny &
    Peignot in the 1950s. Linotype Univers has a much bigger matrix, so to speak,
    so the number system was re-done.

    should note that Adrian Frutiger, although Swiss himself, designed Univers for

    pretty hot. If I recall correctly, it was only in England were the numbering system

    available for licensing, too. Just like Helvetica vs. Neue Helvetica, there is
    Univers and Linotype Univers to choose from. Just remember that Linotype Univers
    was made at Frutiger's own behest (and he participated in its development), as
    he wasn't happy with Univers' transition to digital ;-)"
