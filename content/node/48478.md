  invitations as a side gig and I'm just tiring of the same scripts all the time.
  I've posted 3 that I'm sure are hand drawn but there must be fonts out there that
  are just as full of character. If anyone has any tips I would love it!\r\n\r\nApologies
  if this isn't the right forum for this question.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5517.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_6085.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_5393.jpg]"

  body: I'm not sure the first one is a font. if so it's got some nice [[OpenType]]
    programming. the two a's and the 2 l's are subtly different if you look closely.
    it's a bit harder to tell with the i's ant the r's...

  body: I think the first is hand calligraphy. The 'l's are also different and the
    dots. I think we'd know about it if it was a font. I recommend <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000104">Dear
    Sarah</a> as an alternative.

  body: "Hey, thanks everyone! Paul, I've added Zaner4 to my wishlist, it's really
    nicely done. Feel script, from the other wedding script thread is fantastic, I
    love how it's sort of whimsical. I can't wait to use. Dear Sarah I have and completely
    overuse so I'm very happy for these other options.\r\n\r\nI've also been in touch
    with some caligraphers, which just might be the answer for this particular invite.
    \r\n\r\n"
