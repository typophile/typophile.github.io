  body: "\"Ristorante\" is very, very similar to the font, Freshscript  - but you
    will have to do a slight modification to the letter \"t\" to match it.\r\n\"pizzeria\"
    \ I believe is ITC Eras Book - with a lot of letter spacing.\r\n\"GNA\" is Zapf
    Chancery - but you will have to chop off the tail of the \"G\" to make it match.\r\nBut
    as for \"West Reading, PA\" - no idea, but you may want to try looking in the
    Brush family. \r\n"

    \"Ristorante\" and FreshScript.  It's the R that's giving me the most problems."

    is sort of the original version of FreshScript:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/63952\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, it has been squooshed a good bit."
