  body: Alissa, you should open a new thread for a new ID question. <BR> <BR>PATRICK
    looks like Phenix American, but I think it&#39;s closer to Mekanik with some added
    stem crossing lines. See them both in the 2 pages of the Oblong fonts in the <a

  body: Tiff, I think Industria would need more modification than Mekanik. Look at
    the K, for example, and also the leg on the R. The C is more open in Industria
    too. <BR> <BR>See <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/mekanik/regular/testdrive.html?s=PATRICK&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Mekanik</a> <BR> <BR>Compare with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/industria/solid/testdrive.html?s=PATRICK&amp;p=72"
