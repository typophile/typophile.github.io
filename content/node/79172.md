body: "Could anyone tell me which fonts are these?\r\n\r\nThe main one, which reads
  \"Fid\xE9lio\" and the one which reads \"Beethoven\"? Are those \"Meridien\"? \"Palatino\"?
  \"Frutiger Serif\"?\r\n\r\nAnd also, on the left side, where it reads \"Cole\xE7\xE3o
  Folha Grandes \xD3peras\"? Is that Rotis? But condensed?\r\n\r\nBeautiful artwork,
  by the way!\r\n\r\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/_WOpl3Xt3Xho/TUwXJV3ZxII/AAAAAAAAEIo/qAyugnV3_Ko/s1600/CAPAS-FINAL-Fidelio.jpg\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"
