Below is a representation of where I&rsquo;ve arrived with my client after several alternative directions being pursued and rejected. I have identified (framed) the design that my client has selected from our elliptical choices. Aside from the obvious need to smooth some curves, please help me identify any other problem areas and offer up any color suggestions. The top two options are colors that I presented, while the bottom two are client requested variatinos. Thank you in advance for your assistance &hellip;</p>

<p>FYI: The business provides a service aimed at helping a husband by digitally delivering romantic ideas to strengthen their relationship with their wife. The mark must cross gender lines, but may be more heavily weighted toward the masculine side.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you all for your comments. Unfortunately, I was hesitant to post much more info, due to NDA, but I have clearance from my client to be a little more forthcoming. Perhaps some of this info will pacify some of this critique (or maybe not).</p>
<p>The business is titled *[Business name removed by request] and has very much of an &ldquo;average Joe with hero inside&rdquo; approach. HH will provide monthly emails of pre-planned romantic ideas and reminders that enable husbands to easily sweep their wives off their feet &hellip; and, yes, it&rsquo;s sad but true that &ldquo;such a service is actually required&rdquo; for some of us. Really, it&rsquo;s more of a helpful resource than a requirement.</p>
<p>Early in our process, we pushed the super hero direction pretty far, and later in the process we explored a series of these chest emblem type of designs. That is why this may look a bit sporty, and I may have understated the appeal to our masculine audience. At this point, we won&rsquo;t be heading in a different conceptual direction, but my client (though satisfied with the logo, as is) is open to some minor tweaking. Also, I presented several color choices that included reds (for romance), but so far, none have been accepted. Most of my original color options offered a male/female two-tone color combo. My client really likes blues and blue/gray combos. (I&rsquo;m presenting to a very masculine Harvard grad &hellip; but we&rsquo;ve come a long way from this project&rsquo;s inception)</p>
<p>Thanks again for your comments &hellip; I&rsquo;d love to hear more.</p>
<p>Aloha,
Scott</p>

In response (and I hope I&rsquo;m not frustrating you for not spewing out ALL of this info from the beginning &hellip; I could&rsquo;ve written an epic novel on this particular project), the mark has been presented both with and without the gray strokes and the disappearing outer ellipses. The client likes the gray stroke, feeling that it helps to separate the &ldquo;H&rsquo;s&rdquo; and he likes the disappearing outer ellipses which he feels represent an outer force-field or protective ring. Right or wrong, I have to appreciate a client who critiques art with valid reason vs. preferential opinion.</p>
<p>Keep the comments coming. So far, they validate some of the arguments I have presented to my client previously; and, if I am convinced it is necessary, I may revisit some of them with him &hellip; with a stronger appeal the second time.</p>

<p>The top right is working the best for me only because the blue and green are they same tone so there is an evenness. But I think the gray outline needs to be darker on that one.</p>

<p>Now, about your client who has no taste: when you mentioned *[Business name removed by request], I was disappointed to learn that the superhero direction did not pan out.  Could we at least see it without the disappearing outer ellipse?  It&rsquo;s that element that lends the Sportscenter infographic feel to it in my viewing.  I think that it may have more of the superhero feel without the ellipse.  Besides, don&rsquo;t we want to liberate the husband from the protective shield of idiocy?</p>

<p>The superhero direction was not abandoned at all, just toned down. We are still trying to produce a mark that resembles a superhero chest emblem &hellip; Think &ldquo;Incredibles&rdquo;. (see below)</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HH_SuperChest_3423.jpg]</p>
<p>In addition to trying to smooth out a couple of curves, below is a response to Tiffany&rsquo;s comments. I&rsquo;ve tried to add some weight to the outer &ldquo;swashy lines&rdquo; on the first. These lines remain thin on the second, as the grey relates to the stroke. The third shows the mark without the outer ellipse. I think the question of whether, or not, to include these outer lines will be answered as I experiment with the interaction of the mark with the title, &ldquo;*[Business name removed by request]&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Sorry!  Sarcasm and irony often read poorly in written form.  You ought not take me so seriously, particularly on the &ldquo;client who has no taste&rdquo; part.  Tongue was firmly inserted in cheek when I typed that.</p>
<p>On the count of the outside ellipse representing the protection of marriage, while the association may exist in the mind of your client, I doubt very much that the average viewer would wind up with that idea unless it were explained to him or her.  I don&rsquo;t have anything against &ldquo;protecting marriage,&rdquo; (as a married guy, it is not a completely alien concern to me), I just don&rsquo;t buy that those ellipses are so essential to the logo that if they were missing that concept would be lost completely.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments, guys. I&rsquo;ll continue playing (although, my client thought this design was done last week). Also, below are a few treatments with potential logotype. I&rsquo;m struggling to find a direction I like. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HH_Logotype_4082.jpg]</p>
<p>In previous presentations to my client, I had suggested some more wild type treatments, but it didn&rsquo;t fly with the Harvard guy. I also presented some alternative treatments of the HH (to make them more dynamic and less rigid), but they weren&rsquo;t accepted either.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with you all. I think that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve had so much difficulty developing something I like. Thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be presenting to the client again today, so I think I&rsquo;ll propose that we maintain a certain separation between the logotype and mark, instead of continuing to try and merge the two. Rosem, good suggestion &hellip; I was fixated on using the brand colors on the type because I know the logotype will appear independent of the mark at times; however, instead of always using the spectrum, I can just do that when it is independent of the mark; and, even then, the application layouts may easily lend to accomplishing the branding vs. multi-colored logotype.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all of your comments. If there&rsquo;s anything else, I&rsquo;d love to hear it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for all of your help. During my last presentation, we finalized the following as HH&rsquo;s logo and logotype, which are independent of one another. Now on to the website and ad pieces, where I&rsquo;ll get to throw in a lot more color and imagery &hellip; bringing in some elements of romance.</p>

<p>The multi-coloured one, although it&rsquo;s good, reminds me of pepsi logo, and the yin-yang symbol for the &lsquo;.&rsquo; in .com reminds me of the universal binary logo from apple:</p>
