  using exporting my Freehand files instead of saving them, because I run into compatability
  issues between computers when I 'save as'. However, I cannot export over another
  file, instead I have to create a new file name each time. I've been doing this for
  months, but there has got to be a better way. What am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\n(I could
  use Illustraor, and save as a '.ai' file, but I'm not comfortable designing with
  Illustrator, particularly fonts)"

  body: Get comforable with Illustrator because it work betters than Freehand for
    me. According to some of the pros Adobe is really not doing as much with Freehand.

    are similar to Freehand -- after all, Altsys' Fontographer was the first DTP vector
    drawing program."

  body: "Exporting to what?\r\n\r\nFreehand is a great piece of software. Alas, it's
    dead. Adobe is no longer going to be releasing any updates for it. Still, it's
    usable software, but just a heads up on that.\r\n\r\nIf you are making fonts,
    then you don't really need to export at all. Just cut-and-paste.\r\n\r\n"
