  I open a picture in Photoshop and then go to:\r\nImage  \u2013>  Adjustments  \u2013>
  \ Levels\r\nThis [see attachment] is what I get:\r\nA curve with some peaks (in
  this case: one main-peak and several side-peaks).\r\nI assume that each of these
  peaks represents a specific colour (or am I wrong?)\r\n\r\nNow here\u2019s my question:\r\nIs
  there a way to use this curve with peaks to get the colour definition (CMYK or RGB)
  of these colours?\r\n\r\n(Or am I mistaken and the curve is about something else?)\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any comments.\r\n"

  body: "I think the peaks represent different brightnesses rather than colours. So
    you have here a lot of darkish pixels, from 30-50% brightness, a small range of
    medium brightness pixels (50-55% bright) and a low number of brighter pixels from
    70-100% brightness. There are no pixels that are fully black. \r\n\r\nBest way
    to get the colours would be to select>colour range on your picture, click the
    part of the pic that has a colour near what you want, using fuzziness to control
    the tolerance and then filter>average will give you specific (average) colours.\r\n"

  body: "The levels histogram shows you the value (light vs dark) distribution of
    an image. You use levels to adjust the value of colors by adjusting the black
    point, mid point and white point of the image (the colored triangles at the bottom
    of the histogram). You can also adjust these points on individual color channels
    as opposed to the combined composite channel (thus adjusting the values on the
    blue channel as opposed to the red and green).\r\n\r\nAs to your question: I'm
    not clear on what you mean by color definition? Are you trying to identify an
    images color space from the Levels palette? Or are you trying to identify specific
    colors? If the latter, I'm not aware of how one could use the histogram to do
    that as, again, it shows the distribution of values of the image."

    earlier, I was few days offline.\r\n\r\n> Are you trying to identify an images
    color space from the Levels palette? \r\n> Or are you trying to identify specific
    colors?\r\n\r\nWell, the idea is to use the levels-histogram identify the 'hidden'
    colours in a picture. (I am assuming the peaks represent these colours.)\r\nMy
    hope is that I can use the peaks in the levels-histogram to find in an almost
    'scientific' way these colours in the picture. \r\n\r\nTherefore I would need
    to know\r\n(a) What do x- and y-axis exactly represent?\r\n(b) Is there a way
    to find exact the exact numbers (x=?, y=?) for these peaks?\r\n(c) Is there a
    way to use these x- and y-numbers in order to get colour definitions (RGB or CMYK)
    ?\r\n\r\nI suppose the levels-histogram-tool was not really designed to be used
    in that way, but is there a way use it for the purpose to identify colours in
    the way described above?\r\nThanks again for any comments and suggestions ..."

    and Y axis is frequency (number of pixels that bright). I don''t think you can
    use it to get CMYK values. Your best bet is to select colour range, average and
    use the eye dropper. '
