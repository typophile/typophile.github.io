  been using the Gutenprint driver on my Mac for my hp LaserJet 1300 because hp's
  PostScript emulator works badly with PS outlines in certain fonts (Scala, Minion,
  Quadraat, for examples).\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems like the top-end resolution for
  the driver is 600dpi. I can't seem to find how to increase it further in the printer
  settings, and I can't find any information about this online (maybe I'm asking the
  wrong questions and searching the wrong terms).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know whether
  and how I might get the driver up to 1200dpi? Happy to provide additional information
  as needed. I'm using the latest stable build of Gutenprint (5.0.1) and Tiger on
  an Intel iMac 22\"."
