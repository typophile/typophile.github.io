  body: It&#39;s very clean. I only noticed a couple of things I would change.  <BR>
    <BR>-The arm on the r needs a little more weight. <BR>-You may want to make the
    bowl smaller on the g to give more room between it and the lower arm. <BR>-The
    spine on the s could be smoother. <BR>-On the base curve of the t and top curve
    of the f, I would make them a bit more subtle to work more with the rest of the
    font. <BR>-Maybe try something different with the z. <BR> <BR>I think it has potential,
    it&#39;s very simple and neat. Bring on the uppercase.

  body: Thanks Matt. What about the contrast - do you find it satisfying on all characters?

  body: The contrast looks ok. You will probably have to increase the difference between
    the thicks and thins if you do bolder weights.  <BR> <BR>The contrast of the v,
    w, and x look ok. They look a bit weak where the strokes meet though. You may
    want to move the strokes in closer to each other before removing the overlap,
    if that makes sense.

  body: Tobias, <BR> <BR>I like it, really. But if you ask me personally, I think
    it&#39;s the kind of font that anyone can make. If you understand the basics it&#39;s
    kinda &#39;easy&#39;. It still means that you did a great job and I think you
    should finish it. It&#39;s worth it. <BR> <BR>What do you &#39;want&#39; with
    this font? Is it made for a client, as an experiment, or just for fun? I personally
    miss something exotic &#40;if that&#39;s the right word&#41;, something that makes
    this font stand out from the rest. Maybe try to put something of your own personality
    in, make it yours. You&#39;ve come this far, so it&#39;s perhaps not possible.  <BR>
    <BR>I only speak for myself, don&#39;t see this as negative critics on your font,
    which is a good job. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

  body: Like Jacques also said, you showed a lot of potential when it comes to handling
    curves &#40;which is even for me very difficult&#41;. So don&#39;t be affraid
    to show who you are and start making great fonts.  <BR>Don&#39;t forget to finish
    this one. <BR> <BR>Rock and roll. <BR>
