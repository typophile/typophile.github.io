  body: Agree for Gotham for the main menu font but I really doubt it could be Gotham
    (even with the single storey /a alternate) for the the logo. Looks more to [[http://myfonts.us/td-oRwYAA|Century
    Gothic Bold]] to me...

  body: Sorry, missed the word "logo" in the question! You're absolutely right, Ryuk.
    Century Gothic it is.
