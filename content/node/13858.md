  a list of typefaces that are THE classics? Maybe top fifty serif, top fifty sans...
  I think it would be cool to see which are agreed upon across the board. I know that
  there are various books, such as Bringhurst's, that feature a group of classics,
  but it leaves out newer typefaces. (would [[Mrs Eaves|Mrs. Eaves]] make it, maybe?)\r\n\r\nAny
  references, past threads, etc. would be greatly appreciated."

  body: "I shudder to think of that.\r\nEven if you tried to compile an objective
    list of the most widely used typefaces, or the best selling typeface, you would
    still produce nothing of value to designers or typographers (although that might
    give you a list of what to avoid if you wanted a \"unique look\").\r\n\r\nWe could
    never \"compile\" a list based on the merits or quality of designs for the very
    reason you mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs for personal taste or preference, you really can't
    argue about what someone \"likes.\" I like vanilla, you like chocolate, but today
    we'll both try strawberry. You can say, \"Jane has good taste, and Bob has bad
    taste,\" which again amounts to almost nothing of value.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I
    really have an affection for Goudy Sans (with original alternates). I've only
    used it twice, in fact, I don't think I actually want to use it. I just love the
    shapes, the rhythm and modulating color it creates on the page. But I don't find
    it a very useful typeface. It's like Arrighi's forms in the <a href=\"http://www.acmedigital.net/jiansabu/arrighi.htm\"
    target=\"new\"><em>Operina</em></a>, beautiful but basically unusable.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\nYes,

    think that more than specific faces, it''s important to represent different categories
    in any collection: a geometric sans family, a serif text family, some good display
    faces, a beautiful formal script, something informal. i guess it''s kind of the

    topics here at Typohile. Enough designers seem to visit the site (at this moment
    of post: 29 members 822 guests). Maybe that would help to increase active participation.\r\n\r\nThat

  body: "Will, the essential typefaces for someone starting a studio are usually the
    ones you've already heard of. A lot of work can come from clients with established
    styles/fonts and they'll expect you to match them. The essentials for us as a
    group? Heh. You'd never get agreement on 5 of them, let alone 100. I think we
    all have a handful that we use regularly when there are no constraints other than
    our own preferences. There are certainly other (and arguably better) versions
    of some of these fonts, but they continually come up in my life.\r\n\r\nThese
    are <em>not</em> my favorites, just ones that I've had a need of/use for repeatedly.\r\n\r\nAdobe
    Garamond\r\nFutura\r\nHelvetica (all variations)\r\nGill Sans\r\nMrs. Eaves\r\nMeta\r\nTimes
    New Roman/Times\r\nThe web fonts (Verdana, Georgia, etc.)\r\nUnivers\r\nFrutiger\r\nMinion\r\nTrade
    Gothic\r\nFranklin Gothic\r\nBell Gothic\r\nUnibody\r\nRotis (well, I've <i>seen</i>
    it all over, but haven't had to use it)\r\nAdobe Caslon\r\nTrajan\r\n\r\nHowever,
    a lot of this list is determined by generational trends, design fads, etc. Also,
    notice the lack of script faces. I could make it longer, but I honestly don't
    have the time. The majority of my work is given to me, rather than chosen by me.
    When I have control, other fonts I've chosen in the past few years are:\r\n\r\nFF
    Scala & Scala Sans\r\nFF Absara\r\nMelior\r\nAdobe Jenson Pro\r\nFilosofia\r\nCitizen\r\nMantinia\r\nWhitman\r\nDalliance\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure they'd make many people's 'essentials' list, but they worked very well
    for what I used them for. I often avoid 'typical' fonts, unless it's the best
    solution.\r\n\r\nI guess my overall point is that a consensus would be impossible,
    mainly because our love of a font doesn't make it essential or even particularly
    useful. It's the equivalent of asking what color t-shirt is most essential; maybe
    useful individually, but completely subjective generally."
