  body: "Pre WW I spur serif design. Can't decide if it is lettering or was a font.
    I did not spot an obvious digital substitute.\r\nScale is small but it may include
    an  arrowhead termination on the goose-neck terminals of _C_, _G_ and _S_.\r\nThe
    leg on _R_ reminds me of some Goudy fonts from the era, such as Goudy Oldstyle
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/GoudyOldstyleAsGreys_5824.gif] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-goudy-oldstyle/\r\nSome
    general similarity Vertrina [img:sites/default/files/old-images/VertrinaAsGreys_5784.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/vertrina/\r\nPossible
    substitute, which differs in many details, is a Mark Simonson recreation of a
    1920s lettering style called Goldenbook \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GoldenbookAsGreys_6338.gif]

  body: "For overall letter forms, I think it may have been based on something like

    serifs):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/goudy-38-rr/\r\n\r\nFor general
    look and feel, but still missing some crucial details (such as the |R| and some

    also a passing resemblance to Korinna, which was designed in 1904 (the serifs
    are way off, but the overall form isn\u2019t bad):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-korinna/\r\n\r\nNevada

    at the _G_ I note, in addition to the high bar, a small spur on the chin, a feature
