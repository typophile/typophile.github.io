body: "Does anybody know of a nice typeface that I could pair with this mark? I am
  thinking something that echoes the harder, square based shapes or something that
  works on 45 degree angles? I need it to be somewhat traditional to help bring this
  slightly abstract mark down to earth.\r\n\r\nHere is the (rough) mark:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GO_W_mark_5168.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help.\r\n\r\nSH"

  body: "Really appreciate the comments and suggestions. After looking more, I really
    do think that with such a sharp geometric form, I am going to have to go more
    traditional with just a taste of funkiness.\r\n\r\nI will post updates soon with
    where I am ending up.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
