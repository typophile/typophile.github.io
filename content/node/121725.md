    decoration is called a median spur:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/median+spur/fonts/\r\n\r\nYou
    could search the free font sites using \u201Cmedian spur,\u201D  \u201Cwestern,\u201D
    or \u201Ctuscan gothic\u201D....."

    (/S looks pretty close). Customized (rounded, slightly distorted and median spurs
    added)?\r\nSome ready-to-go options: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/virtuecreative/roper|Roper]],

    as a freebie for pixelbuddha here:\r\n\r\nhttp://pixelbuddha.net/freebie/bushcraft-font-family\r\n\r\nIt's
    part of the family, if you scroll down :)"
