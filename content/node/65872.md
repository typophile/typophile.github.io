  body: If it's for a logo, you could customize the right "leg" of the K with a swash.
    Which could (or not) join the left stem of the A.

    give some more details about your project. For example, what \"feeling\" should
    this have \u2013 classic or modern, high-class or accessible for everyone, \u2026?
    There are very many beautiful fonts out there, and they all \"feel\" a little
    bit different. So we would really need to know more about what you are planning
    to do, and who the audience is."
