  body: "You're right. Even if Geometric 231 is Bistream version of Kabel ITC, they
    remain slightly different, mainly /r leg finial angle, straight for BT Heavy (or
    Adobe/Linotype Black) and oblique for (original) ITC.\r\nBut still no chance with
    this single storey /a... Borrowed from another font? Futura?"
