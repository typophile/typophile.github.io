body: "Hi--\r\n\r\nI am in the beginning phases of putting together an exhibition
  of Unbuilt Architecture in Oregon, or just Portland.  I was a stylish simple, like
  masthead, to put on the top of my grant proposals, informational materials and eventually
  to serve as the logo of the exhibit.  I was thinking of setting the two works off
  in different faces for instance something like Tekton for the word unbuilt, since
  it suggests drawings and then something either classic or dynamic for \"Oregon\"
  or Portland.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit will be geared toward the general public but it
  is located in a trendy, very modern part of town.  I am debating whether or not
  I should try and reflect this in the type that makes up the title or if I should
  instead focus on Portland and Oregon's pioneer heritage or identity as a nature
  loving \"green\" place.\r\n\r\nI would like to use this in screen displayed materials
  (for emails) and in the tangible world for the exhibit materials etc.  Also if you
  want to give me a bonus you could suggest a good font for the information placards
  next to the drawing and models in the exhibit.  i was thinking the title of the
  unbuilt work could be in some kind of snazzy display font, or maybe something like
  Tekton (to suggest architecture) and then who knows for the text information beneath
  it.\r\n\r\nI know very little about design and though I would maybe ask some experts
  like y'all to help.  Anything is appreciated."

  body: "Yeah, I am going to be the graphic designer.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the advice.
    Ideally, I would hire a graphic designer and a curatorial assistant and some researchers
    to help me out.  Unfortunately, I am a grad student and I am paying for most of
    this out of my own pocket and student loans because I think it's a worthwhile
    project.   If I could deal with eating less than the one meal a day I eat now
    I'd totally try and budget a graphic designer.\r\n\r\nAgain though, any advice
    anyone can provide its appreciated.  I understand I am not going to get a full
    scale consultation for free over the internet but I thought it would be nice to
    ask and see if I could get any quick, off-hand suggestions.\r\n\r\n"

    MyFonts sell commercial typefaces, but you can search the ones with no price tag
    by typing this on your browser:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/lowest_price:0/fonts/"

    around trying things out here and there on myfonts and fontshop.  Perhaps when
    I put something together I will post it here so people can tell me if its terrible.\r\n\r\nKeep
    it coming typophile.  Any help is very appreciated."

    quality that might suit (and you could try the Sans too although I feel that is
    not so architectural). Personally I would avoid snazzy typefaces for information
    graphics the less intrusive the better.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Thanks Tim!\r\n\r\nI really like Museo and use it often.  It was kind of
    my gateway font into the world of typography.  I may end up using it.\r\n\r\nPoint
    taken re: the info graphics.  I am on the look out for something that very subtly
    transmits the ideas of possibility and/or history without being to zippy.  It
    will probably be impossible.  i am willing to pay a little though."

    always post that and then perhaps we can suggest alternates.

  body: "This is the basic king of direction I was thinking.  Two typefaces that contrast
    with one another.\r\n\r\nActually trying things out I may think I am totally trying
    something thats not going to work.  Everything is further complicated by the fact
    that \"Oregon\" may become \"Portland\"\r\n\r\nBut yeah... right now I just want
    something to put at the top of grant proposals and eventually a press release
    or two.  I am doing it all myself so dpending on how long it takes me (given these
    examples awhile) I may just have to settle for something crappy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/crapbeginings_4887.jpg]\r\n\r\n"
