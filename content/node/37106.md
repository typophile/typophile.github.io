  body: "I searched the entire 25 pages of the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html\">Script
    Font ID Guide, Part 11</a> (Everyday hand-printing) and did not find this exact
    font. As our FAQ says, these kinds of fonts are very easy and cheap to make, so
    it could be custom, but there are many <em>similar</em> fonts available. Here
    is a list of some I saw on my browse: Andy (p.3), FF Friday (p.4), Skippy Sharpie
    (p.5), Greg HW (p.6), Dik HW (p. 10) and Casino Hand (p.24). My criteria were
    to have the same 'a' style and 'G', with a neat, skilled lettering style.\r\n\r\n-
