body: Typophiles, I need your assistance.  I&#39;ve decided to get a bit more serious
  about my freelance web design work, so I&#39;ve decided dump the name and logo I
  was playing around with before.  I&#39;m looking for a distictive typeface to help
  develop an identity. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not planning on everything being married to
  the mark; I don&#39;t need a logo so much as a good typeface and consistent colors.  Nevertheless,
  any critiques on positioning, size, etc. would be helpful. <BR> <BR>So far, I&#39;ve
  tried &#40;in order&#41; Morphica from Shinn Type, Luna Modern from PsyOps, and
  Reykjavik 2, D Weight from PsyOps.  Tell me if they work, and feel free to recommend
  <i>any</i> other typefaces. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25730.gif"

    mark is still a little more complex than the typeforms. Maybe use Morphica as
    your inspiration for the mark, rather than trying to find a font that works well
    with your mark. As you can see by the postings, thus far, Morphica seems to be
    a pretty good type selection, but there is a lot of concern about the mark. <BR>

    work just as well in the identity department, and give me more flexibility in

  body: I like it even better with the descriptive byline. At small scale the descriptor
    is likely to disappear in places, but for once I think that works really well.
    Morphica goes even better with the graphic element at this smaller scale because
    of its detail increases in complexity. The descriptor, combined with the bolder
    and simpler &#40;at large scale&#41; title, &#34;chromatic&#34; looks more like
    the graphic. The interior shapes of the graphic look a little more simple than
    the vibrant shapes that seem to be flaring out. In fact, I wonder what it would
    look like if the interior shapes and chromatic were the same color, while the
    outer, flaring shapes and the descriptor were similar varying colors

    <BR>If you&#39;re bent on using Morphica, pair it with a simple mark that uses
    color to play off of the company name. Use shapes, sizes or proportions that are
    sympathetic to the type. Or, as you mentioned, lose the mark altogether. <BR>

  body: 'Sorry, Daniel, those references &#42;are&#42; pretty obscure. Let me try
    to explain. Leroy Neiman is an artist who came to prominence in the &#39;70s,
    and who, in my opinion, uses color in a garish way. Here&#39;s a link to some
    of his work: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.leroyneiman.com/merchant.ihtml?pid=347&amp;lastcatid=20&amp;step=4"

    <BR> <BR>Your mark reminds me of what would happen if his style of painting was
    combined with the hard-edged style I associate with the &#39;80s, when digital
    illustration via Illustrator/Freehand became popular. <BR> <BR>So when I look
    at your logo, I see visual nods to two decades, sitting next to type that&#39;s
    got a &#39;90s deconstructionist feel. It just doesn&#39;t hang together for me.
    <BR> <BR>Chromatica is a really cool name. I guess that&#39;s why I think you
    should explore more options.'

  body: hey daniel,  <BR> <BR> i read a book about signs and symbols by adrian frutiger
    and he stated that &#34;pure abstratction can lead to unwanted similarities in
    logotypes.&#34;  <BR> <BR>It seems like the people on this thread dislike it because
    they cant figure out what it is. I think you should go with the season idea. looking
    forward to seeing your progress. keep up the great work.
