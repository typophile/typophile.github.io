  a huge set of wooden type letters we've got in the fine art academy I study in.\r\nThe
  types seems to come from Xilografia Internazionale Legnago, a xylography industry
  from Northern Italy.\r\nAmong them there is a ultra-compressed grotesk, a geometric
  sans-serif, a display slab serif and an egyptian display font.\r\n\r\nYesterday,
  after photographing all the type, I walked to my local supermarket and noticed the
  very same egyptian font on display on the streets. The uppercase E is almost unmistakeable.\r\n\r\nDo
  you have any idea what this font is?\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\na."

  body: "The lowercase gets some differences indeed.\r\nMy wood type may be a redesign
    or a copy from the same model (i.e. the Windsor designed by Elisa Pechey in 1905?)?\r\n\r\nIt
    seems that the Xilografia Internazionale Legnago also collaborated from time to
    time with type designer Umberto Fenocchio, whose Linea typeface ( http://www.umbertofenocchio.it/linea.php
    ) seems to me one of the hundred akzidenz/helvetica local redesigns (I've also
    found some digital rip-offs of this font).\r\n\r\nStill, since I was searching
    for original wood types to digitalize, I guess I'll just have to discard this
    font.\r\n\r\nHere are some pictures or the geometric grotesk font from the archives,
    do you have an ID for it too?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0823_5248.JPG]\r\n\r\n(mixed
    with some compressed grotesk, much closer to Umberto Fenocchio's 'Linea Compatta')\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0896_3793.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0836_5010.JPG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIMG0837_3509.JPG]"

    be worth digitizing, especially since what I call \"fauve\" fonts are quite fashionable
    these days. Not that that style is my own cup of tea...\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I've
    also found some digital rip-offs of this font</blockquote>\r\n\r\nUnless the original
    was made into an \"official\" digital font, the usual term for that is \"revival\".

    and Cheltenham -and Trebuchet- have a similar \"g\") but I actually had my eye
    more on things like the \"R\" for example.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: As far as the lighter sans is concerned, the /R and the /B have a distinctly
    Secession look to it, which suggests that this particular typeface may have been
    copied from Austrian sources during the first two decades of the twentieth century
