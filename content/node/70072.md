  cards.\r\nThe problem is that I'm a programmer and my sense of esthetics is bordering
  non-existence.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nSo I thought to ask the pros of the internet for
  some advice (someone has to stop me before I use Helvetica(again)).\r\nI know it's
  a bit cheeky to ask for free advice when people do this for a living, but after
  all, isn't that what the internet is for?\r\nAny way i'm looking for a typeface
  (as you might have guessed), I'm going for a minimalistic design, probably black
  on off-white(but I'm open to suggestions).\r\nI'm looking for a typeface with a
  kind of mathematical or computerized feel to it, hopefully simple and readable,
  I'm thinking sans-serif but what the hell do I know...\r\nObviously, I'm prepared
  to pay for the typeface but i don't want to mortgage my house.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\np.s. I'm sorry if this type of post is not welcome
  here, I didn't see any forum rules so I assumed it's okay.\r\n\r\nEdit: I forgot
  to mention, my slogan is as follows:\r\n\r\n<strong>pseudoSheep</strong>\r\nWhen
  code monkeys dream...\r\n\r\nIf that sparks any ideas."

  body: "Monospaced fonts are associated to coders mainly between IT professionals
    and designers. For many people this association is not so obvious.\r\n\r\nI'd
    prefer to use fonts very clear, with a strong vertical display and no ornaments
    at all. Some examples: ITC Lennox, ITC Orbon, Handel, Verve, Badloc, Assembly
    SSI. "
