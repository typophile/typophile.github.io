body: "I need help knowing a certain typeface. However, I do not have a picture. What
  I can offer is a description. The certain letter I'm looking for is a lowercase
  \"g\".\r\n\r\nOn the bottom of the letter, the lower area is open. A chunk has been
  taken out of the letter. So, imagine a lowercase Gill Sans \"g\", but the lower
  portion is missing a piece, on the left side I believe.\r\n\r\nI originally thought
  this was done by Spiekermann, but I could be wrong. Any help would be amazing."

  body: It's similar to all of those, but it's a much wider opening. The ends of the
    opening are both straight. So, I guess you could say the terminal is very clean
    and pretty wide.

  body: <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?font=FF+Signa&q=Go">FF Signa</a> is
    more expanded with a pretty big chunk missing. Really hard to say without some
    sort of visual... just not clicking.

    goes.\r\n\r\nKlavika is close, yet the top and bottom of the character are more
    rounded. The bottom is almost a circle, but not complete."
