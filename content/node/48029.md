  not the case if you apply the Generate Instance on an open MM using the menu command.
  \r\n\r\nIs this a feature or a bug?\r\n"

  body: A "feature". You need to transfer font.features (a list, transfer items one
    by one), font.ot_classes (text) and possibly font.classes (list) separately. Karsten

  body: "Thanks for the workaround Karsten.\r\n\r\n<code>font.classes</code> from
    the MM font are preserved when using the Add instance method and I can't see a
    reason why the OT features shouldn't be passed to single master like they do when
    you are using the Generate Instance menu command. Re-attach them (transfer from
    MM to the new instance) like you describe works fine though.\r\n\r\n"
