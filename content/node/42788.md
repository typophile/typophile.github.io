  \ Can anyone think of any interesting ideas for typographically representing this?

  body: "why zeros ? \r\n\r\nbecause consciousness seems to depend on material (brain
    matter) but is itself non-material. it is \"empty\" in the buddhist sense of the
    word, without location, without permanent form.\r\n\r\nbecause the zero as a symbol
    for \"no-thing\" had to be invented (by consciousness).\r\n\r\nand the various
    forms of zero (or any character) overlaid transparently will display both the
    unique qualities of each and the similarity of all.\r\n\r\nalso: i think the use
    of lowercase \"i\" in so many products now is a related reference to consciousness
    in the sense that it triggers the identification of self, the self-conscious \"me\".

  body: "<em>I have been asked to represent consciousness typographically...</em>\r\n\r\nThat
    sounds like a typically moronic design school project. Typography is a tool for
    making language visible and recording linguistically structured ideas in a visible
    form. Typography represents language, not abstract concepts. It can be made, within
    the conventions established and exploited by advertising, to express a fairly
    crude set of qualities or emotional responses (excitement, fun, elegance, etc.),
    but this is only successful insofar as the thing advertised actually possesses
    such qualities to some degree (intentional irony excepted, in which case the success
    depends upon the contrast between the quality evoked and the thing itself). Even
    in such situations, typography remains primarily linked to language, to the ability
    to say something meaningful in language, and not to pure form. So in order to
    say something about consciousness typographically, you first have to say something
    about consciousness."

    an idea I've started to explore, where instead of conscious attention actively
    moving along static text (absorbing it in 3-second increments), units of text
    are presented sequentially in the same place, in 3-second intervals. You can see
    it in the Softmachine video at http://typography.tv/ (the link is the icon that's
    an \"S\"). It's more like 2-seconds per word/phrase, though. "

  body: "<cite>That sounds like a typically moronic design school project.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    sort of disagree with this, although it did make me laugh. I think it's a really
    bad project for undergraduate students studying typography. I've seen a lot of
    Type 101 projects that are all about type as an expressive form, and yet these
    students come out knowing nothing about how to lay out a book or magazine. I think
    the idea of representing consciousness typographically is interesting, though,
    if the students know the rules and traditions of typography. \r\n\r\nI'd be more
    interested in how you could make this project about the act of reading, or the
    act of creating letterforms."

    Say it strong, loud and proud. Don't sugar coat it, just let it rip. I'm not talking
    about the sentimental smoochy kind of love, I'm talking about the kind where life/death
    is on the line. Talk about that... and say it without boarders, malice, and sarcasm
    etcetera. Keep it raw. As a reference point you might want to check out the work
    of graphic designers like Sister Corita (even though she had a paritcular slant
    to her work).\r\n\r\nOther than that, talk about Life. The vibrancy of Life, how
    unstoppable it is, how vital it is. There's lots of other stuffs too like, the
    Groove... "
