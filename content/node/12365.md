body: "I have a family of 4 fonts I am close to putting onto Myfonts.com. I have been
  testing the kerning & design in Illustrator & Word on screen. I plan to print out
  some samples as well. Because my font is modular & only has a few kern pairs (250
  maybe) in it, & the kerns have to be in whole tile units ( <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/9915\">pool
  tiles</a> ) it has been straight foreward to check these things on screen. I am
  not sure what too look for or be worried about in print however. I imagine a thorough
  testing would involve an inkjet & a laserprinter & maybe reversing the type but
  I am just guessing/imagining. \r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my question - What seems
  like a basic/minimal set of tests (on screen & off) to you? I won't have the luxury
  of trying the font on newsprint on a web press, but short of that, what do do when
  you have a display face? What do you do for a bodytext face?"

  body: "I am working on my first typeface now, so keep that in mind I am no expert.
    It is a text face that could be used for display as well, and I have been seeting
    alot of paragraphs with Indesign filler text, using text generated from Adhesiontext,
    and also just random paragraphs from essays and stuff I have wrote. Then I have
    also done waterfalls of display sizes Like \"Hamburgefonstiv\" and I have been
    looking for a few things. a) counters filling in slightly or dark areas in the
    text b) bad kern pairs that are either two far away or two close. I usually just
    circle them and make notes on the side and then review them and look for common
    problems and go back and fix them. I have printed on a 2400x2800 dpi inkjet, a
    600 dpi, laser, and a 2400 dpi laser.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this helps?"

  body: "Thomas, I am sure it does help. Thankyou!\r\n\r\nJohn, My fonts will be in
    \ Mac Type 1, Open Type CFF, PC type 1, & PC true type. I am using fontlab & using
    automatic type 1 hinting & then for the true type I am using Fontlab's type 1
    to true type hinting tool & getting rid of anything fontlab thinks is a stinky
    hint. Hinting a truetype display face may be overkill but I am doing it anyway.
    Actually - what do you think about that? The fonts I have are definitely in the
    display category. I am interested in non-dispaly related advice too though.\r\n\r\nNow
    that I have started to test them I realized that the grunt work of making sure
    you are not putting out stinky data is something I have not been spending enough
    time thinking about. Moreover there is no doubt a great deal of hard won wisdom
    out there! Some of it might be in house trade secrets - but not all of it. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    no doubt Adobe checks many many OS's & kinds of printers. What do you think a
    small foundry's level, a kind of baseline level of checking should be?"

  body: For TT and OT, I would consider Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/FontValidator.mspx">FontValidator</a>
    to be essential to any testing procedure. If you are doing any manual hinting,
    you should run FV before hinting to catch outline problems, and then again after
    hinting. The FV help is generally pretty good at explaining the error codes, but
    not necessarily at helping you figure out how to fix them. I'm going down to Redmond
    next month, and one of the things I intend to discuss with the MST folk is the
    idea of a collaborative online annotated help resource for FV, so that developers
    can share information about methods to fix font errors. In the meantime, you could
    ask here, or consider subscribing to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otlist.htm">OT
    developer list</a>, if you are not already on it.

  body: "For OpenType CFF, and maybe PC TrueType, I'd suggest running the \"CompareFamily\"
    tool from the Adobe OpenType FDK.\r\n\r\nYou're right that Adobe does do quite
    extensive font testing. We have people whose sole job is to test fonts, and since
    getting into OpenType we also make use of ourside beta testers, just like any
    other piece of software. Personally, I can no longer imagine shipping a font without
    outside testing, any more than I can imagine shipping InDesign without outside
    testing. But then again, I have funny ideas about treating fonts like other software
    in a bunch of ways.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you could also be looking at:\r\n\r\n- set
    up a Word doc on Windows and move it to the Mac OS. Can it find the fonts? Do
    the same going in either direction with at least one application that keys of
    PostScript FontName (e.g. Illustrator) and at least one application that does
    other weird stuff (e.g. InDesign).\r\n\r\n- Make sure that the font behaves as
    you wish with regards to font embedding.\r\n\r\n- Output on at least one Adobe
    PostScript device, one HP clonescript device, and one GDI/Quickdraw device. Both
    Mac and Windows. Do this from both an app that uses normal system drivers to print
    (e.g. Word) and from an app that handles output more directly (e.g. InDesign,
    QuarkXPress, Illustrator).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

    body: "Thanks T! \r\n\r\nHaving a conceptual map for application types & behaivior
      testing is great.  Really great. I could have imagined way to many variables
      to introduce into the process.\r\n\r\nI know what an Adobe Post Script device
      is. \r\n\r\nI imagine I can figure out what an HP clonescript device is. Probably
      any HP inkjet. I could Ask HP. Although I'd appreciate any extra hints about
      how to identify one. :-)\r\n\r\n I looked up GDI/Quickdraw but I don't seem
      to have enough insight to seach google properly for this info. Is this what
      non-hp injets use?\r\n\r\nI should probably check embedding ( Into a PDF no?
      - What else? ) on mac *& windows*.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
