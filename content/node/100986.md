  body: Humanist 521 - Bold & Condensed. For "G" I really dunno at this moment...
    Perhaps Candara font.

  body: This is one of a series of posters done by artist [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/vip223/galleries/72157622949213930/|John
    Gilroy]] for Guinness in the 1930s and 40s. Like many color posters of that era,
    this one was probably hand-lettered. My eyes aren't as keen as they used to be,
    but I believe the two lowercase <strong>a</strong>'s are slightly different. The
    artist was clearly using Gill Sans (1926) as a model. (This poster predates Candara
    by nearly half a century, and Humanist 521 is Bitstream's brand name for Gill
    Sans.)
