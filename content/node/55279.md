body: "To tell you the truth I am new to Graphic Design so the only Graphic Designers
  or Typographers that I know of are the ones that I have studied in class. I have
  not yet found one designer that I like in particular but there is a design style
  that I have been very attracted to since I started in the Graphic Design program
  at Loyola and that is Swiss Design, which is also known as International Typographic
  Style. Swiss design is usually asymmetrical, grids are noticeable on site, and when
  using type it is usually flush left san serif. Swiss design is simple and clean
  and I like both. I think my favorite thing about the design style is the Swiss fonts.
  My favorite font, I do know, is from the Swiss design era and it is Univers. Armin
  Hofmann is one of the designers that I learned about and a lot of his work I do
  like. Here are two piece that I like and below are some  sites that talk about him.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.swiss-miss.com/2006/10/armin_hofmann_d.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.citrinitas.com/history_of_viscom/images/modernism/arminhofmann.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/on-armin-hofmann\r\nGiselle-Armin
