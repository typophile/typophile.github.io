    fonts, not made for printing. You can find many of them at sites like Dafont.com,

  body: Hi, thanks for the reply. Well what struck me about the font was the differing
    x-height of the t and f (please forgive me if I'm using incorrect terminology).
    I was curious if there are any standard fonts that do something similar.
