  body: BTW, the only reason to have double-posting now is lack of patience. OR, I
    should state, that is the reason it happened to me the other day.

  body: Yves, although that's true, the most well known version of Holly Goldsmith's
    Bossa Nova is the one available through the Adobe Type Library. They carried long
    before it was available via the MvB site or FontShop.

  body: "Yves,\r\nI said 'Adobe' because that was where I knew to get the font, and
    that was where I found the showing. I saw you marked the ID to show MVB Bossa
    Nova, but we can waste a lot of time getting fussy about sources. I agree with
    Grant, who I think understood why I said Adobe. Are we going to need to add foundry
    abbreviations (like MVB in this case) to every ID we make, so we need to add MT,
    ITC, LT, BT, P22, etc, to every name? That's going to be tedious and hair-splitting,
    in my opinion. People just want to know the name of the font, and someplace they
    can get it. Do we need to list every source too?\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to make
    a big issue out of this, but it seems like Grant's question was answered without
    the added comment, because Adobe calls the font 'MVB Bossa Nova'.\r\n\r\n- Mike
