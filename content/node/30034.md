body: "I have designed a business card for myself and I would like some feedback.
  It is still in the sketch phase (everything could be changed). I like the typeface
  on the front and back. It has been made on a letterpress. The paper is not good
  to print on. Maybe it looks a bit old fashion, but I think it is suitable for a
  letterpress printer\r\n\r\nI am not sure if the 'CANUS' should be more in the middle
  or more near the toward the upper-side of the card?\r\n\r\nDo you have difficulty
  understanding the  e-mail and web-site address?\r\n\r\nI knowthat in the first line
  on the back-side the 'SS' spacing in PRESS need to be changed and the 'l' directly
  after the 'PRESS' is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nThanks, Terence\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/back_5051.jpg]\r\nback\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/front1_6691.jpg]\r\nfront1\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/front2_6166.jpg]\r\nfront2"

    why not only capitalize CANUS in the first 2 lines across the back? That way you
    would avoid both the gap between the 2 currently capitalized words (which is drawing
    too much attention) and the issue with the Sl combination.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming
    you're aware of the spacing issue after the (0) in the phone number.\r\n\r\nAnd
    why \"dot\" in the email & web addresses? Why not just use periods? You may be
    stuck with (at) if you're setting metal, but there's no reason not to use periods
    here (other than to be \"different\").\r\n\r\nAlso, while this may simply be due
    to the blurry photographs, the inking on these looks a bit muddy; it looks like
    all of the \"e\", \"a\" and \"4\" counters are filled in, etc."

  body: "> <cite>Do you have difficulty understanding the e-mail and web-site address?</cite>\r\nThis
    is a particular peeve of mine. It\u2019s a technique that is used online to avoid
    spam. Like Jason I can understand the (at) if it isn\u2019t @ your disposal. ;^)\r\n\r\nI
    would register <em>canuspress.com</em> and use that, registration and hosting
    are incredibly cheap these days.\r\n\r\nWhat weight is the paper?\r\n\r\nOn another
    note, if you\u2019re setting up a printing press check <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tripprintpress/\">these
    guys</a> out on Flickr. Their stuff would interest and inspire you."

  body: "Thank you both for commenting\r\n\r\nJason: Your idea too only capitalise
    CANUS is a good point. I was aware of the spacing issue after (0) but have no
    idea why I didn't write it in my notes to correct. The 'e' 'a' and '4' counters
    are filled in. I only had some left over etching paper with me when I printed
    this (I blame the paper) in combination with the pressure (but when I print them
    for real I can adjust both).\r\n\r\n\r\nJason and Conor: 'dot' is in the e-mail
    address, because in another typophile topic there was a comment on letterpress
    printing and the '@' symbol and if you did test.test(a)test.com it would be inconsistent,
    because the '.' and '@'.\r\n\r\nConor: I am beginning of setting up a small printing
    press and if it is successful and I get the rent out I will by a proper internet
    address. \r\n\r\nWhat weight is the paper? That is a good question. I only used
    it in the past too print etchings on. But I was planing to ask my teacher or go
    look at the KABK-shop. So when I know I will post it here. Thanks for the link.\r\n\r\nPS.
    On another note to Jason thank you for referring me too Wogibi press."
