  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all, first post here, been lurking picking up tips for a while.</p>
<p>This is a college project in quite early stages for a shop that sells international food ingredients, vegan food, organic food etc. so it has to be quite neutral in terms of what the shop sells but a welcoming feel and a quality aesthetic are a must I think as well as looking quite cool to appeal to the younger generation of cooks as well as the ethnic families who would use it for general grocery shopping.</p>
<p>I will eventually be developing a brand identity and all the accompanying material so while I haven&rsquo;t got that long to design the logo itself I want it to be high quality to support the rest of the work, hence asking you guys&hellip;</p>
<p>many thanks in advance, Matt</p>

<p>ps. it has been pointed out that the third looks like a logo for a company called pangur so that one while possibly the most successful in terms of simplicity is pretty much out the running</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>this is tricky one for sure, and I don&rsquo;t have any specific suggestions, so I&rsquo;ll give you a bit of a brain-dump and hopefully that itself might lead to some solutions:</p>
<p><strong>1) Presentation of food</strong></p>
<p>well, as a vegetarian, I know I wouldn&rsquo;t desire to see any form of meat on the store sign, even though I am rational and well aware that there will be meat, in all sorts of forms I may never have imagine it, inside the store.  Meat would be a turnoff.</p>
<p>A vegan might be turned off by the suggestion of animal-byproducts.  This is your dairy, your honey, and things like that.  I can&rsquo;t speak <em>for</em> them, but I can certainly imagine they might not have the greatest feelings towards a cheeseburger or a honey-glazed ham.</p>
<p>Speaking of ham, jewish and muslim dietary laws forbid pork (kashrut and halaal) so think that if you are gearing this store towards religious or cultural groups as well, you&rsquo;re really going to have to do your research as to what they are and what would turn them away from a store.</p>
<p>If you are going to depict food, the caution is make it look like a grocery store, and not a restaurant.  Bread is generally safe for all groups, grains and vegetables are safe for all.  It&rsquo;s certainly a tricky way to depict a sign.</p>
<p><strong>2)Presentation of dishes</strong></p>
<p>Well, this certainly takes the emphasis from the food itself, and focuses more on the cultures.  The bowls are an excellent idea, and you might find a great way to symbolize multiple groups or cultures this way.</p>
<p>Caution: don&rsquo;t forget a group - if you miss asian-styled bowls but have every other kind for example, an asian might assume that&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t have asian supplies there.  You either have to be specific and complete, or generic and inclusive.  Make different shapes to signify diversity, but perhaps not actual depictions of specific cultures bowls (the colour you used is another way to show &lsquo;different bowls&rsquo; even with the same shape.</p>
<p><strong>3) Depiction of diversity</strong></p>
<p>This one would focus more on culture and international cuisine than even food or the dishes it&rsquo;s served in.  In my hometown we have a global food store, who uses a globe as their logo.  Travel Agency? that&rsquo;s the first thing that pops into my head, but it can be pulled off correctly.</p>
<p>caution here is to establish that it is without a doubt a food store. Generic flags might help, but it&rsquo;s certainly tough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I haven&rsquo;t thought of a perfect super-awesome idea for you, I really wish I had, but I hope that these promote some thought and help you arrive at a solution sooner.</p>
<p>Best of luck, and your designs look good, so I have no worries once you land on that genius idea (and you will) that you&rsquo;ll be able to pull it off woderfully!</p>

I must say I like the spoon better (#2 – not the green splotch, that looks kinda &hellip; gooey). 
I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m influenced by any recent campaigns here, but that empty looking bowl plus the hands holding it, without a body attached to them, says &ldquo;Feed the Hungry&rdquo; to me, which is kinda not what this is about.
Also, since this is for a food <em>store</em> if I got that right, I must say I&rsquo;m not sure about using dishes and spoons; actually all food stores I can think of off the top of my head don&rsquo;t use any &lsquo;food&rsquo; imagery at all. Must say I like Mikey&rsquo;s idea to use a more abstract sign &amp; focus on the diversity aspect.</div>

Another one is the colours: warm them up to reflect savoury/sweet food aswell as the warm family atmosphere. Perhaps the orginal pink mixed with a more earthy orange might be quite cool. Yeah I&rsquo;ve had enough of the spot at the bottom, it&rsquo;s a bit much.
I&rsquo;ll be having a chat with my tutor tomorrow to so I should have a few roads to go down.

<p>some more experiments, using a bolder type weight and more earthy/food colours. Also seeing how it will look grey &amp; black.</p>
<p>Altaira - it is (was) a food store but it&rsquo;s more about packaging etc now in terms of the brief - like it would have it&rsquo;s own brand food on sale. Tutor seems happy with how it&rsquo;s going and I think I&rsquo;m settled on the bowl now it&rsquo;s just a case of making sure it looks like it&rsquo;s got food in while keeping it simple</p>

<p>Re the new designs, I still tend to agree with Paul. Also, on a more &lsquo;technical&rsquo;/detail note, the hands would need more &lsquo;volume&rsquo;; they look a bit like cut out of paper &amp; wrapped around the bowl. If you follow the line of the bowl you&rsquo;ll see that especially the ring and little finger are almost 2-dimensional.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><strong>@James:</strong>  using <em>-ise</em> is a british english convention, using <em>-ize</em> is an american english convention.</p>
<p>If you have your spell-checker set to american english, even words like oragnise, or capitalise will be spelled incorrectly, but that&rsquo;s because firefox works.  If you use the british english spellchecker I&rsquo;m sure words like organize would be underlined, even though in another country with another language that might be preferred.</p>
<p>American english is different, and british spellings, although understood by some americans, is incorrect within the country of the United States.  Likewise, a british person might be able to read &lsquo;organize&rsquo; but it&rsquo;s not correct in England.</p>
<p><strong>@Ratbaggy:</strong>  I sat here, trying to figure out your <em>food meets jazz improv</em> logo and me and 3 other designers couldn&rsquo;t figure out anything other than <em>the</em>.  I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re just missing something obvious, but unless the idea it&rsquo;s trying to communicate is a disordered group of letters that don&rsquo;t form words, I feel that it hasn&rsquo;t communicated anything of value to me.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to look them up online, or in a phone book, I couldn&rsquo;t say their name to another person, their identity as far as I can see it, has been reduced to a symbol.</p>

<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3223/3053997284_5cc7ee9359_o.png">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3223/3053997284_5cc7ee9359_o.png</a></p>
<p>Personally I think you nailed it with number 2; the spoon says food while the curved drip is a nice visual pun integrating the type with the image.</p>
<p>You could consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a wooden spoon to emphasise (or emphasize) the natural/vegan side a bit more and move away from the western-style utensil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the apostrophe being a wee leaf instead of a drip - very veg and says ingredient instead of finished product. would also play well if the rest of the image and type were black/dark grey (gray) for contrast. Solid colours will also translate better across different mediums (business cards, signs, websites, napkins, glasses, windows&hellip;you get the idea).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nice choice of typeface. Cap &rsquo;m' feels a little uncomfortable esp. as &lsquo;international&rsquo; has a lowercase &lsquo;i&rsquo;. I would prefer to see &lsquo;mata&rsquo;s&rsquo; all lowercase with &lsquo;international food&rsquo; smaller, all caps and letter-spaced; type can be quite subjective but definitely worth spending a bit of time on as it will make the logo.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re looking for here is a good idea (which i believe you have) – the rest is just tweeks.</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What about world utensils instead of bowls? Chopsticks, spatula, tongs, knife, fork and spoon. Obviously need to be careful to not appear as a kitchen store. IMO, you need a clearer and stronger idea in your design if you are going to choose to use an icon. You will never have the best logo if you simply draw a picture of something and set words, however nicely styled. I fall into this trap often.</p>
<p>Also, show us your work in black and white (no color, no gradients, no grayscale to hide behind). I think this will help you a great deal as you seek to clarify direction. Plus it will help when the client says, &ldquo;we want to silkscreen our logo in one color on reusable hemp shopping bags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BTW, Matta&rsquo;s is a great looking word. But I dont think your type choices are doing it justice. I think a more spontaneous, organic, wordmark (no picture of anything) might provide excellent foundation for an identity system. Have you tried drawing the word? Or lettering something with better lockup? Perhaps there is a subtle way to twist the lettering to reveal a deeper concept (without being gimicky). This can often produce an excellent result.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
