  Germany 1893). Athough the symbol on the middle of the\r\nsecond line looks like
  a U, the vertical strokes seem to me to\r\nbe too close together; I thought it might
  be a commercial sign \r\nlike the \"per\" symbol (unicode U-214C).\r\n\r\nI'd be
  most grateful if anyone could tell me more about it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nJim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
