body: A colleague of mine is working on a publication for the <a href="http://www.sensoa.be/"
  target="_blank"> Sensoa</a> organization, and asked me if I knew which typeface
  was used for their logo. It doesn&#39;t ring a bell, so I thought I might as well
  submit the question to my esteemed fellow type-IDers. Does anyone have an idea?
  It&#39;s quite likely the logo is custom-drawn, but yaneverknow... <BR> <BR><img
