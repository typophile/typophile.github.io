  but something a true typophile should certainly consider as it may be the most everlasting
  piece you design\u2014a sort of last business card in stone. It's not something
  I necessarily thought about until nearly two years ago when I had to design one
  for a family member. I didn't want to go with the standard designs and type options
  the monument company provided, so I asked if I could design it myself. In case you're
  interested, it only requires an Illustrator/EPS file much like one you would prepare
  for a vinyl letter cutting machine. Everything has to be converted to outlines and
  you have to keep in mind how the machine works. I started by doing some research
  in the cemetery into which the tombstone I was doing was going to be placed. Attached
  are some photo that served as my primary source of reference."

    of your life.\r\nSo maybe it's best to get people who knew you to design your
    tombstone? The problem,\r\nof course, is the risk of them setting it in Comic
    Sans.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      In the case of the cemetery I was in, almost all of the contemporary stones
      used the same serif/san serif combination, as shown below. Anyone know what
      the sans serif font is? Kind of nice.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CLEMENTS_3956.jpg]"

    in Mrs. Eaves. Very saucy of her, I think. I prefer Storm's John Baskerville.
