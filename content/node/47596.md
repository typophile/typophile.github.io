body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI have been working on this set of letters for the logotype
  for a client. The letters were created in illustrator. The type will go along with
  a yet to be determined mark. They are very happy with how it looks so far, but I
  was wondering if there were any ways that I could make it better, improve it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/overtypo_5554.png]\r\n\r\nI
  would love any feedback, comments or opinions. Thanks\r\n\r\nBig version of the

    think at smaller sizes this may hurt legibility.\r\n\r\nIs this supposed to read
    as one word or two?"

    more breathing space between them. It is meant to be read as two words so I have
    augmented the space between the two.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typetrack_4716.png]"

    to help break them up a little more. I dont see a clear division between the two.\r\n\r\nIs
    this a font or custom design? Something about that 'm' really bothers me."

  body: Yes totally agree with colors, I would just like it to work in a single color
    for the moment. It is a custom made design, no fonts were used. The idea for the
    'm' was that its angle would help divide the words. Perhaps it can benefit from
    a softer curve in the middle of the bottom section?

  body: "I would make try the shape of top of \"a\" similar to the bottom of \"e\".
    They differ too much. Actually \"a\" differs too much from other letters style
    too much.\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"m\". I'd keep the first one but make it narrower.
    But just enough. You don't want it squashed and you don't want it too wide either
    (the way it's now. But as said I would keep the first design. Looks much better
    and it also matches \"v\" and matches other letters' style better.\r\n\r\n\"h\"
    is too narrow compared to \"u\". \"r\" is MAYBE a very small bit too wide. \"o\"
    is almost definitely too wide.\r\n\r\nAlso \"stabilise\" \"e\" a bit more at the
    bottom, because it looks a bit too much off and is falling.\r\n\r\nWhen changing
    \"a\" I would suggest you make the top and bottom match, but try making the middle
    line horizontal.\r\n\r\nThese are my suggestions.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert

    not too sure how to stabilise the 'e' as I'm not sure what exactly is wrong with
    it.\r\n\r\nI have implemented your comments into this version. Although I am not
    a fan of how the 'a' looks with a middle horizontal line I really appreciate your
    comment on how to construct it using the 'e' as it give me some ideas which I
    quite like in the third version below. The 'h' was obviously too narrow, thanks
    for spotting that. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo33_6579.png]"

  body: "Your letters are waaay too tight. au is almost moulded together... \"h\"
    is probably much better but it's hard to tell since \"u\" is too close to \"a\".
    And maybe to \"l\" as well.\r\n\r\n\"m\" looks too much like golden arches. You'll
    have to make inner lines inside it a bit more steep (different angle than outer
    ones). It will still have correct style but its own distinct look (not recognisable
    by hamburger fans)...\r\n\r\nI like the middle \"a\" but upper line is too short
    and doesn't reflect the style of \"e\" enough. But it has exactly what I wanted
    to see: top and bottom line angle match. I like it but I may not be the best judge
    for it since it was something I wanted to see.\r\n\r\nCan't say about the \"o\".
    Too tight letterspacing and no small size. But it may still be just a little bit
    too wide.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

    homogeneity.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/overtype6_5560.png]\r\n\r\nConcerning
    your question about making it a font, I have thought about it and something I
    have attempted before ( http://www.dache.ch/index.php/portfolio/typography/ )
    but the technical aspects of making them are almost overwhelming and I have left
    them unfinished. I still enjoy drawing typefaces though."

    shapes as all being from neon or bent wire (for instance). I find the new 'v'

    originality and becomes a little too uniform.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I think you are
    pretty much there. Just down to your gut feeling on this and what you prefer. "
