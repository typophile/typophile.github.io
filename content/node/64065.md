  body: If your type size is below around 11 point you should consider a medium or
    semibold weight. I would also open up the spacing a bit.

  body: Depending on the printing conditions, you should consider the possibility
    that colour plates might not line up perfectly. If you mix your background colour
    with more than one ink, knocked out text can easily be destroyed.

    If you can, you should bring the question to the attention of the printer, which
    indubitably will have some samples and insights to share.\r\n"

    Might give toy guys a better idea of what im trying to do. The grey text indicates
    the text which will be spot UVed, but it will be black on black ie. the background
    is black and the spot uv is black.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Spot varnishes are not black in color... they are actually a clear yellow,
    which appears clear over the ink. If you print spot varish on white paper it will
    actually turn the stock a slight 'yellow'.\r\n\r\nDepending on if you use a 'dull'
    or 'gloss' varnish it will cause a color like black to change in appearance as
    it catches the light."

    sinks but turns the area it yellow ( thats what i read somewhere but didnt quite
    understand why). thanx again CreativeNRG and everyone else. great help!\r\n\r\nThis
    is the first time i am attempting this technique so i want to make sure all goes
    well."

    thing is for sure... if you look at this straight on the Gloss varnish 'disappears'
    completely. You only see it when you turn the card and it catches the light.\r\n\r\nIf

    2 pictures there is a gloss varnish on a white uncoated paper which i see has
    turned the paper slightly yellowy. what about the final foto? is that the back
    of the design or an entirely different one using brown paper?\r\n\r\nalso i need
    you to please clarify the difference between glossy and dull varnish. ive been
    googling it but the fotos look the same to me, i cant see a real difference.\r\n\r\nIve
    included some examples of black on black that im trying to achieve and also im
    meeting with the printer today to see what he has to say. with the regards to
    the varnished type, it might be quite interesting to engage the audience in trying
    to decipher the hidden text. also as  u can see i highlighted the important info
    in white so its draws the audience to the keys words as soon as they turn over.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1036681242204512_4416.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/angle_4884.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/spot-uv-2_6180.jpg]"

  body: "By using both 'dull' and 'gloss' varnish together you can achieve this type
    of result shown over black. They may have also used a gloss varnish over a very
    dark PMS Gray. There are a couple of different ways this might have been done.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n'Dull
    Varnish' will produce a very matte finish and light will not reflect well off
    of it.\r\n--------------\r\n'Gloss Varnish' will produce a very shiny finish that
    will reflect light and appear almost wet.\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nYour examples
    show this really well and it would be an excellent idea to bring them along so
    the printer can see exactly the affect you're after.\r\n\r\nThe third image I
    uploaded is a 'Spot Gloss Varnish' over a solid PMS 1545 [Dark Brown]."

    and 'editing' my previous post before the time limit locks me out. Unfortunately,
    Typophile resets the post time after an edit which bumps things out of order.
    :(\r\n\r\nKnowing what you're trying to accomplish... one might recommend that
    you print the background in the darkest PMS gray you can find... then print the
    type in Black and drop a spot gloss varnish on the black type.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "haha i know what u mean, i frequently edit right after posting because i
    type so quickly i often leave major typos!\r\n\r\nill run your recommendations
    by the printer and see what he says. im also reading up on a few designers who
    applied matt lamination before applying a spot uv varnish on certain areas in
    their specific designs. is that an alternative process to dull varnish or the
    same? i read it produces a 'velvety' feel and im not too keen on that. does the
    dull varnish do the same?"

  body: "UV and matte lamination is done 'offline' after the sheet is printed. Most
    of the time this is a protective cover. They basically apply it off a roll to
    cover the entire press sheet. I've not heard of printing on that after it's been
    applied but it wouldn't surprise me.\r\n\r\nThere is also an 'aqueous coating'
    (matte or gloss) that is used as a protective cover over the sheet. This protects
    the ink from scuffs. Most magazine covers have either an aqueous coating or lamination
    applied. This keeps the ink between copies from rubbing together during transport.
    If they don't do this micro vibrations in the bundles will rub the ink off in
    spots like sand paper.\r\n\r\nA dull varnish shouldn't produce a velvet feel if
    you have a stock with a smooth finish."

    i found some reaaaaaally nice pure white 350gsm paper to work with. \r\n\r\nits
    uncoated paper, but the printer said that he can matt laminate it before applying
    the varnish.\r\n\r\nhe also said because there is white text they are going to
    have to color the paper a really dark grey, so as u suggested im going to find
    the darkest PMS grey to achieve the look i want.\r\n\r\nhopefully all goes well!"

  body: "Note that you will get two subtly different effects depending upon whether
    you choose to put down matte lamination and then print spot gloss varnish on top,
    or whether you put down gloss lamination and then a spot matte varnish on top.\r\n\r\nFor
    a black-on-black type treatment, what you describe will probably give the results
    you're after.\r\n\r\nBut when working with photos, for instance, I've found that
    matte lamination kills the color in a way that the gloss varnish can never bring
    back. Whereas the opposite approach will maintain richness and still yield a nice
    effect (although the matte varnish over gloss lam will never have quite the same
    velvet surface as matte lam).\r\n\r\nAlso, is your printer really talking about
    a lamination, or does he mean an aqueous coating? Laminations can have a tendency
    to cause curl (because it's a plastic coating) if the back isn't somehow balanced
    out and if the humidity of the shop doesn't match your world. A publisher I worked
    with used to have a heck of a time with certain book covers curling during different
    times of the year."
