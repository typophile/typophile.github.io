  between fonts. My problem is that as a student I know very little about fonts myself
  and I&#39;ve had difficulty finding any difinitive distictions. <BR>My aim is to
  take categories such as Serif and Sans Serif and break them down into sub categories
  such as Slab, Neo, Geometric, Humanist. I also hope to be able to describe their
  most distictive features i.e. Humanist = anti goemetric, anti perpendicular, slightly
  bent tips and so on. <BR>And to the question: <BR>Is there a trusted comprehensive
  source for detailed information on fonts? <BR> <BR>All advice welcomed and greatly
  appreciated, <BR>Thanks, <BR>Kanebo'
