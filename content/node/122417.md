  I know that this photo was taken around the 1930's, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
  It's a geometric sans serif, that I am assuming was not made specifically for this
  sign.\r\n\r\nI've so far ruled out:\r\nFutura (top lobe of the \"B\" needs to stack
  over the bottom)\r\nGill Sans (counters on the \"B\" are too tall)\r\nKabel\r\nAkzidenz
  (\"O\" is not circular enough)\r\nErbar \r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n"

    not, but most certainly it was made for <em>signs</em>, so it\u2019s improbable
    you can find a perfect match among typefaces made for print.\r\nYour best bet
    is finding a good approximation in a modern recreation which imitates the look.
    It shouldn\u2019t be difficult, given the recent popularity of geometric vintage-looking
    offerings (a few examples: https://www.myfonts.com/newsletters/sp/201501.html)."

  body: "Thanks, Riccard0. Much appreciated. I did find a nice contemporary geometric
    sans based off of what the Europeans were doing in the 1930s. \"Novecento Sans.\"
    Though, I must say that I'm attracted to using something that is rooted in history
    (literally), versus something inspired by history. There's probably an argument
    there...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMike"
