body: "Some CEO dumps a logo on my desk and tells me to make a new one with an entirely
  different text but using the same font. Me: \"Sure. So... what's this font?\" Him:
  \"How should I know? That's your job innit?\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-bw_3579.gif]\r\n\r\nIt
  <em>could</em> be a custom job; however, I rate that as unlikely, given the subtleties
  -- the left and right leg of the \"U\" are of slightly different widths, and the
  \"N\" has some surprising curves I just know I've seen before (perhaps Friz Quadratish?).
  OTOH, I'm not too wild about those \"E\" and \"F\"s. Still, I'd like to know."

    Theunis, perhaps you can enlighten us - What did you end up finding?
