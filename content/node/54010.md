  from these forums. Secondly, I'll admit that I am lurker, nor a professional designer--however
  I hope that you all may be willing to help me with some ideas.\r\n\r\nI have recently
  taken over the responsibility to re-design the (currently awful) website for a small
  local nature shop. The store caters to an environmentally concious, generally older
  upper-middle class, loyal and friendly clientele. They sell bird seed, feeders,
  etc. as well as field guides, binoculars, and the like. They pride themselves on
  their friendly, expert service and environmental responsibility.\r\n\r\nI'm trying
  to decide on a typeface for their logo heading that is elegant, warm, and \"natural\"
  feeling. So far I'm thinking perhaps something like [[http://tinyurl.com/anegwp|Paradigm]]
  or [[http://tinyurl.com/aq6mwo|Brighton]]. Any other suggestions? I love Beorcana
  too, but it's a bit too \"hard\" for what I'm after.\r\n\r\nI would also very much
  appreciate suggestions for matching text and heading typefaces for the newsletter
  that will be on my to-do list once the website's up and running.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJonathan"

    and thin strokes. I don''t know if you did this consciously, but those are distinguishing
    characteristics of Cheltenham, the font that L.L. Bean has used for their catalogs
    for almost a century. If your target audience is older folks with a taste for
    outdoor activities, they''ll like the vibe. '

  body: Sorry, I assumed you were in the States. Not sure if L.L. Bean is as popular
    in Canada as it is here.

  body: Hmm, I had a look at Chetlenham and it certainly does have the same sort of
    feel to it. I am familiar with L.L. Bean, more by reputation than experience,
    but hadn't thought of it when trying to find the right face. Thanks for pointing
    that one out.

  body: I like the Berkeley Oldstyle, it's similar to another face I was looking at,
    [[http://tinyurl.com/djoarr|Brioso]]. I think I still prefer the "bold"-er (less
    delicate), low contrast faces like Paradigm and to my eyes, the two don't pair
    well. In fact, I'm not sure what <em>would</em> pair well with Paradigm as a newsletter
    text face--any suggestions for that?
