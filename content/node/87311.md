  body: "FLF fonts are adaptations of existing fonts with some minor changes to avoid
    straight copying. To me this font looks like a slight modification of URW Stymie.
    The serif on the middle arm of the E is gone, but offhand the rest looks the same
    to me. The G has the beard, the Q has the same tail, and the R leg is fairly close
    to the stem just like the posted sample. Stymie's serifs are shorter than Rockwell's,
    but in the U.C. letters are quite similar except for the letters I mentioned.\r\n\r\n-
