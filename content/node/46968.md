  i'm thinking now on finishing my \"Clarendon\" and start a script and a italic font.
  The problem is like on everything: knowledge.\r\nI'm searching for books easy to
  get and/or cheap so i can get some notions and learn how is a good letter on script
  and on italic.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me on this subject?"

  body: "Most of the books on calligraphy are not worth bothering with, but even if
    there was a good one it would not be of much use.\r\nThe only way to really understand
    italics, or any pen script for that matter, is by using a broad edged pen or to
    some extent two pencils taped together. I have been a calligrapher and lettering
    artist for over 40 years and I am still learning.\r\nNor wishing to be disrespectful,
    but to think that it would be possible to design a decent italic font without
    a reasonable understanding of the characteristics of letters produced with a broad
    edged pen is expecting too much in my opinion. Seeing decent italics is one thing,
    understanding them is another.\r\nIn my opinion if you want to design a decent
    italic font, then forget the computer for a while and learn basic calligraphic
    principles first with a pen in your hand ( might take you a few years though).\r\n\r\nIeuan

    Italic and Schneider Antiqua Italic.\r\n\r\nDiotima and Palatino Italic are the
    very essence of the female versus the male perspective... designed, oddly enough,
    by the married team of Gudrun und Hermann Zapf.\r\n\r\nDiotima, a supple and graciously
    curved italic... Palatino, an angular, more masculine, even harsh italic. Both
    equally beautiful.\r\n\r\nSchneider Antiqua is an entity unto itself. A triumph
    for Werner.\r\n \r\nSet your sights on these and you will succeed.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    love swaches, i love Dino dos Santos Capsa Italic and Andrade Pro Italic but i
    like ventura and volupia altough. I've just said Dino dos Santos work because
    i'm familiar to it. About those  that typerror told me to see i liked i liked
    diotima italic, palatino italic and schneider antiqua italic although still don't
    have the smooth the swaches i'm interested too. About Zapf work i don't like much,
    or in other words, i'm not interested on doing those kind of things, at least
    for now.\r\nJust told you this so you can council me.\r\nSo for those who have

    that pen in hand is a better teacher, but a library could get you started. If
    there are any descent calligraphy classes in your area, that would be better yet
    as a good teacher can point out structural problems in your forms from the start.
    Also...have a good look at some Italics that are based soundly on Calligraphic
