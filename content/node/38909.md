  body: "Perhaps the still-under-development Sugar Sans? Look if I was funny I'd be
    posting on Comedy Central's board.\r\n\r\nSeriously, however, call me crazy but
    I think either the book weight of \"National\" here:\r\nhttp://www.vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights/\r\n\r\nOr
    Stella Regular here:\r\nhttp://www.vllg.com/Feliciano/Stella/mudTyper+Weights/\r\n\r\nwould
    be a solid choice still far enough off the beaten path to make you appear particularly
    resourceful and meticulous.\r\n\r\nOf course then there's always Switzerland Narrow."
