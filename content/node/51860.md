  body: Not bad, Alex! It's probably just your image, but the stem widths appear uneven
    ('b' too light). Try a "save for web" from Illustrator instead. The 'g' is a little
    too heavy at the bottom of the link between bowls.

  body: "That looks quite nice. A few things:\r\n\r\nI saw the differences in weight
    too. But looking at the PDF, I think it was probably the jpeg that did that.\r\n
    \r\nI also think the overshoot on round characters might be too large. The baseline
    seems uneven.\r\n\r\nPlaces where strokes join the stem (like on the bottom of
    the 'a' and 'b' etc.) could use a bit more room, to counter the appearance of
    little black blobs.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The signature shape here is obviously how the round bowls switch to straight
    strokes. It's jarring to my eye now, but mostly because unless I look carefully
    it just comes off as a malformed curve. You may want to consider actually <em>increasing</em>
    the abruptness of that break (thinning the straight parts? increasing the acuteness
    of the angle of break?) to make it more assertive, so that the reader's eye gives
    up on interpreting it as a single rounded stroke. Just an idea...

  body: "The lowercase t looks like it's floating when paired with a non-overshooting
    glyph. Try to overshoot it, but not too much. Also, your both uc and lc s look
    like they're from another font. Maybe you should add the 'stiffness' that other
    glyphs have (look at the counter of b, for example).\r\n\r\nBest of luck. It looks
    really nice :)"
