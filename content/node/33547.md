  One seems to be Parsons as a nice fellow assisted me with that ID. Here are the
  samples:\r\n\r\nhttp://hamgallery.com/qsl/country/Canada/3qs.htm\r\n\r\nhttp://hamgallery.com/qsl/country/Canada/3du2.htm\r\n\r\nhttp://www.schmarder.com/qsl/wbt.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
  third one here appears extremely close to parsons. At http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/barnhartbrother/parsons/
  I wonder how \"modernized\" this version of Parsons is from the sample link above?
  I know old fonts like cheltenham have been modernized into things like ITC Cheltenham,
  but are the older original versions available?  Also, the kerning today is very
  different than what they could do with lead, hot or cold.\r\n\r\nIn any case, thanks
  in advance for any help identifying the other two fonts above!\r\nMany regards and
  thanks\r\nEugene\r\n"

  body: "The small type in the 3qs example is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cheltenham/\">Cheltenham
    Old Style</a> and Cheltenham Wide (don't know of a digital version). The large
    type is a typical wood type grotesque. The word \"CANADIAN\" is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/copperplate-gothic/\">Copperplate
    Gothic</a>.\r\n\r\nSome of the small type near the top in the 3DU sample is DeVinne.
    The only digital version I could find is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/de-vinne/\">this
    one</a>, but it's apparently based on a large wood type cut, not the small metal
    cut in your sample. I'm pretty sure the rest of the small type is an old metal
    font called Grasset. \"A.R.R.L.\" is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/copperplate-gothic/\">Copperplate
    Gothic</a>.\r\n\r\nRegarding the last one, I'm also the one who identified it
    for you on the [T-D] list. This is about as close as you're going to get to the
    original metal Parsons. There doesn't appear to be any ITC-style design modernization."
