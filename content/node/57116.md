  but am interested to see what font it's based on (if any). It looks like it may
  be the same font as in this corner badge, seen on the same site (http://www.biomondego.pt/).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Safari002_5237.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Safari003_6734.png]"

  body: "Awesome, thanks. Great font. I thought this font might be the same as the
    one below (or of the same family, like Neo Sans), but upon closer examination
    it seems to be different. Any ideas what this font is? It's from the Burocratik
    website (http://www.burocratik.com/), the creators of the Biomondego logo.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Safari005_6121.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Safari006_5882.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Safari004_6298.png]"
