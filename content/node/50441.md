  my mac from Tiger to Leopard (10.5.5).\r\nI am not able to properly preview 'rare'
  ligatures any longer.\r\n\r\nSo to clarify, when I check 'Common' I see for example
  the standard 'fi' ligature, but activating 'Rare' removes the 'fi' ligature and
  additionally doesn't show me any of the more advanced ligatures as it used to.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas as to why this might be happening?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSeb"

    and also deactivates LIGA (when \u2018Standard\u2019\_is checked). \r\nFEX 1.2.3

    there yet, plus the board suffers from serious spam attacks, at the moment."
