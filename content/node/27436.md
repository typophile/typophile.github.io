  body: "One thing I noticed while browsing your 'Identity' works, was the similarity
    between <a href=\"http://www.solid-creative.com/images/print/liberte_logo1.gif\"
    target=\"_blank\">your logo for 'libert\xE9'</a> and the 'Nestl\xE9' brand. <em>(
    Also <a href=\"http://www.solid-creative.com/images/print/erwesEesti_logo.gif\"
    target=\"_blank\">the 'Erwes Eesti' logo</a>, slightly reminded me of <a href=\"http://www.elementskateboards.com\"
    target=\"_blank\">the 'Element' mark</a>, but that may just be me. :)</em>\r\n\r\nOther
    than that I think I like the site itself. Its simple and clean.\r\nNothing too
    fancy, or edgy. It works. And that sure is what it should do. :)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dav.name\"
