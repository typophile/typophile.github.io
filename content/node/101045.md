body: "Dear Forum\r\n\r\nI am very brand new to this.\r\n\r\nI really wish to create
  a PROPER Yiddish font, since i type a whole lot in that language.\r\n\r\nI won't
  go into details now.\r\n\r\nI am trying to use Font Creator to make the font.\r\n\r\nBut
  I have a whole lot of problems.\r\n\r\nI want to use the font with Microsoft Word\r\n\r\nI
  need a lot of help, especially with the left to right - right to left problem.\r\n\r\nI
  have no trouble creating the glyphs I need.  They are based on a simple\r\nHebrew
  font with about 10-15 additional glyphs, which are used only\r\nin Yiddish.\r\n\r\nI
  do not need any Latin characters, but I want to be able to use both\r\nupper case
  and lower case to create the needed new glyphs\r\n\r\nIf you think you can help
  me,\r\nI would VERY MUCH\r\nlike to have somebody as a kind of mentor to get me
  through this.\r\n\r\nI am willing to spend a  lot of time with this, but I need
  some direction,\r\nespecially at first.\r\n\r\nContact me at\r\n\r\ncaspari@tx.technion.ac.il\r\n\r\nI
  will surely reply to any responses,\r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\n\r\nDavid Tal\r\n\r\nHaifa,
  Israel. "

  body: "I want to wish you success on your project and share some ideas. Creating
    a proper meshet font will also help those of us trying to OCR old documents. I've
    been wanting to help make such a font for a while and I'm happy to help any way
    I can, so long as your work is open source.\r\n\r\nFirst, I urge you to develop
    this font with an open-source license, so as to permit others to easily collaborate
    and build on your work. Here's an example of an excellent open-source font license,
    the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL%2BFE\">GPL+FE</a>\r\n\r\nLikewise,
    I think you will be able to learn much from the work of other open source Hebrew
    fontographers. Have you heard of the <a href=\" http://culmus.sourceforge.net/\">Culmus
    Project</a>? Maxim Iorsh and Yoram Gnat are two open source Hebrew fontographers
    in Israel. Yoram in particular helped me out with a Rashi font. Let me know if
    you need any help making contact with them."
