  a very clear image of what that looks like comes to mind. I also associate it with
  its own history, geography, etc.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for the term <cite>Scotch</cite>.\r\n\r\nHowever
  \u2013 undoubtedly because the latter evolved partially from the former \u2013 there
  are many typefaces which I might term either way. In my head there is this kind
  of scale between Modern and Scotch that looks something like this:\r\n|Modern------|--overlap--|------Scotch|\r\n\r\nSo,
  my question (lightly aimed at Nick Shinn) is this: What are the lines between Scotch
  and Modern? Are all Scotches (Scotts?) necessarily Moderns? At what point is a typeface
  beyond-a-doubt Scotch or non-Scotch?\r\n\r\nKnowing a typeface's origins and design
  history tends to bias my distinction on a case-by-case basis, so I'd be curious
  to get more of an understanding from a purely formal approach. Specific examples
  would help a lot too.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is an issue that can't be nailed down
  with 100% precision, but if it could, I'm sure it would happen here."

  body: "The characteristics of the Modern (Didone) style are:\r\n\r\nHigh contrast\r\nVertical
    stress\r\nUnbracketed serifs\r\n\r\nThe class of Scotch types meets the first
    two criteria, but its adherence to the third varies.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch has bracketed
    serifs.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of looking at this--strictly taxonomic (i.e.
    what the physical features are), or philogenic (how they evolved).\r\n\r\nSo we
    have the Panose system, with\r\n\r\ncove\r\nobtuse cove\r\nobtuse square cove\r\nsquare
    cove\r\nsquare\r\n\r\nwhich are taxonomic\r\n\r\nand IBM with\r\n\r\ntransitional\r\nmodern
    (didone)\r\nclarendon\r\nslab\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nSome wrinkles:\r\n\r\nThe Century
    styles are Scotch, but in headline faces they tend towards modern, and in text,
    towards slab.\r\nTimes Roman has Scotch capitals, but not lower case--except in
    the bold. Bit of a mash-up.\r\nPress gain on letterpress text gives the impression
    of subtle bracketing.\r\n\r\nWhen Richard Austin, inventor of the Scotch, started
    his own foundry, he addressed the problem of easily damaged type by coming up
    with what I term the Scotch Modern -- the style with huge, fine serifs and tiny
    aperture. The brackets are so attentuated that they thin out, becoming didone-like.
    It was that style of type which was first termed \"modern\" in the late 19th century,
    not Bodoni, which had yet to be revived, and which is probably now considered
    most typically \"modern\".\r\n\r\nSo, as the distinction between Modern and Scotch
    rests on the degree of bracketing, the degree of \"Scotchness\" of a particular
    typeface may vary with both its optical size, and the foundry that produced it.
    \r\n\r\nFor instance, consider these four faces. Pretty similar, eh?\r\nYet De
    Vinne is generally considered a Modern, Georgia and Century Scotch, and Clarendon
    a slab serif.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Scotched_5769.jpg]"

  body: "Interesting\u2026 so then it's all about the bracket?\r\n\r\nWould that make
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/monotype-modern/|Monotype Modern]] technically
    not a strict Modern but a Scotch Modern?\r\n\r\nIt's funny because over time,
    my hyper-simplified technique was to just look at the cap R, and depending on
    the upstroke at the end of its leg, I would make my distinction. Anything with
    an extreme flip (\xE0 la [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/|De
    Vinne]]) I labeled as Scotch and reserved <cite>Modern</cite> for the earlier
    French originals. I think perhaps my assumption of what was typically Scotch was
    what you refer to more as Scotch Modern\u2026 those exaggerated Austin-esque versions
    which just scream <cite>Victorian</cite>. For whatever reason, I was lumping those
    faces in with the sturdier, less exaggerated Scotches like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/|Miller]].\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    my scale should look something more this this:\r\n|Didone----|--Modern--|--Scotch
    Modern--|----Scotch|\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\nIs it appropriate to separate Didone from
    Modern?\r\n\r\nI'd also be curious to know where you would place something like
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/zooth/|Zooth]] (for lack of a better
    example) \u2013 the Moderns with ridiculously large (but still unbracketed) serifs."

  body: "<em>Would that make Monotype Modern technically not a strict Modern but a
    Scotch Modern?</em>\r\n\r\nThat's my view, and I do think the nature of the Scotch
    is open to interpretation.\r\n19th century typography generally hasn't been given
    critical respect or attention, so there is still much to be discussed and theorized.\r\n\r\nHoefler
    & Frere-Jones, in the blurb for their <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100032\">Chronicle,</a>
    consider the Scotch to be Transitional.\r\n\r\nWhat then does that make typefaces
    like Century or De Vinne, with their enormous serifs and pot-hooks on a and R?\r\nThey're
    not modern, in the sense that they don't have the Modern's openness and reductive
    simplicity.\r\nAesthetically, they are between Oldstyle and Modern, but they are
    not transitional, as we understand that as meaning \"on the way to\".\r\nThey
    follow on from the first Modern types of Didot and Bodoni, but we can't call them
    Post-Modern -- too 20th century.\r\nSo that's why I've suggested Scotch Modern
    as a term for this genre.\r\n"
