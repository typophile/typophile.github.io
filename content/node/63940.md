    Erik's Right Hand, Optima Semibold, Bauhaus, Invisible OSF: it <em>really</em>
    depends on what your project is all about. Maybe size or linespacing is more important
    than your font choice, and maybe Fette Fraktur isn't the best choice in the first
    place. Sorry about my crystal ball being in bad condition tonight.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: So are we just looking at a heading and subheading, or will there be anything
    else in the mix too, like body copy?

  body: No body copy. It's an Ad for a building supply company. Blackletter isn't
    my first choice, but my boss likes it. Thanks.

  body: i was thinking of using it in lowercase. don't get me wrong i like fette fraktur,
    but i'm unsure about the use. i'm still struggling with the pairing. usually we
    use mrs. eves and trade for this companies identity, so i think i'm having a hard
    time setting aside there identity. thanks for the help.

  body: It just seems so weird to use Fette Fraktur for an ad for building supply.
    I mean, what's the concept? How can you make it look like that's the font that
    <em>needs</em> to be there? Maybe the subhead can help you achieve that. Dunno.

    couldn\u2019t resist.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m interested to see how this turns out as
    well. You don\u2019t see blackletter in ads very often, if at all ... maybe once
    in a while in Revolver Magazine."
