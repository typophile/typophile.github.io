  The kerning feature works well in all applications except Microsoft Office (on Mac
  and Windows too). What is happening? \r\n\r\nP.S.: I\u2019m working in Mac OSX using

    Spacing and Check the box for \"Kerning for fonts:\" and set the point size as
    low as the lowest size you will be using (or lower)."

    before generate the font files :) The real problem is the Word configuration!
    Thanks Paul for the hint!"

  body: "Simon, \r\n\r\ndo I understand this correctly? \r\n\r\nMicrosoft produced
    a new set of OpenType fonts (the ClearType collection: Cambria, Calibri, Candara,
    Constantia, Corbel etc.) which does not contain old-style but only OpenType kerning,
    Microsoft made these fonts the standard fonts for Office 2007 but at the same
    time Office 2007 does not support OpenType kerning but only old-style kerning,
    which the new standard fonts don't have? This would mean that with Office 2007
    and the new fonts, it's not possible to get any kerning at all, while it's still
    possible to get kerning using the old fonts, like Arial or Times New Roman, since
    they use the old-style kerning. \r\n\r\nIs that right? I'm puzzled. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
