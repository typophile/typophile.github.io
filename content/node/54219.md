body: Hi everyone, I'm trying to decide on a good serif to pair with DinPro Regular.
  This serif would be used as menu/header on an interactive website. If anyone has
  any good suggestions it would sure be appreciated!

  body: "I paired it with Minion a while back. Worked simply.\r\n\r\nRIT's student
    produced magazine uses DIN with PMN Caecilia. It's ok, but not the best.\r\n\r\nI
    think something like Melior would be a nicer and more interesting pairing."
