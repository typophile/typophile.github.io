  body: "Old as in 3 years ago ... or old as in 60 years ago?\r\n\r\nEven considering
    the poor quality of the image,  the fact that, in the first E, the bottom is wider
    and, in the second E, the top is wider - this would argue that it was drawn by
    hand.\r\n\r\nIn some ways it suggests some Celtic influence - seen in fonts such
    as <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/american-uncial/' target='_blank'>American
    Uncial</a>."

    paint. :) I can edit later with a better software if it really necessary.\r\n\r\nThe
    font that you suggested gave me a start point. Thanks so much."
