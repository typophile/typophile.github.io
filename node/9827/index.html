  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, <BR> <BR>this is my first font i've ever made. It is a quite a strange mixture of classicistic fonts and modern semi-serifs. <BR> <BR>i have just finished a first sketch of the lower case glyphs, now starting with upper case, and i would appreciate some feedback about the work so far. <BR> <BR>I haven't done any kerning or spacing yet, so it doesn't make sense to show reading-sized text (it would be too ugly), but the font is intended to be used as reading-font for small text-passages, and display-sizes. <BR> <BR>what do you think about the idea at all? what about horizontal stroke-weight? is it too thin for reading-sized text? any suggestions about one of the glyphs? <BR> <BR>thanks for your comments, <BR>sebilar <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67605.gif" alt="gif of lowercase unnamed_classicistic_semiserif"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Right now it feels a bit like a didot, with the weaknesses that implies: I think the widths of your horizontal strokes will be pushing things at text sizes. Also, the color feels inconsistent. <BR> <BR>I like the serifs, although I think maybe they're a little too consistent right now, with all of them facing left except for the g. They also look a little funny on the v, w, and z, although I'm not sure what I'd like to see instead. <BR> <BR>The t feels a little stunted. The spine on the s feels inelegant and chunky, although I like the terminals. <BR> <BR>The counters all look nice, except the m feels a little compressed and the c has too much open space inside. <BR> <BR>I like the tail on the y. <BR> <BR>Overall, this has promise. This has kind of a postmodern feel without being irritating about it, and I like what you've done with the idea of semi-serifs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">you are right, a high stroke contrast implies lesser readability, that's why i intend it for short texts only (maybe jewelry-advertising? i don't know), and for display use. <BR>&quot;Also, the color feels inconsistent.&quot; &ndash;&gt; can you explain me this one? i am German-speaking and don't understand this one (word). do you mean gray impression that might be not even? <BR> <BR>the direction of the serifs is inspired by Rotis SemiSerif (Otl Aicher), i think they are okay, except maybe for the z (i can't figure out how to do them right). <BR> <BR>i am unsure about the t myself, but i don't know how to do it yet. is it right that the cross bar has to be x-height? <BR> <BR>s is (as expected) my big problem child <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> i just don't know how to do it right. do you think it should rise more steeply? <BR>at the moment, it's too small as well. <BR> <BR>you are right on the c and the m. c has to be corrected, i will have a look on m as well. <BR> <BR>i hate the tail on the y <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>do you really like this one? <BR> <BR>well, next big step will be upper case, but before i will think about re-doing the horizontal stroke weight. <BR> <BR> <BR>thanks a lot for your feedback, this really helps me to continue <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&quot;Also, the color feels inconsistent.&quot; &ndash;&gt; can you explain me this one? i am German-speaking and don't understand this one (word). do you mean gray impression that might be not even? </i> <BR> <BR>Yeah, the large aperture and thin lower stroke in the c, especially, might keep the letters from creating an even gray on the page. &quot;Color&quot; is indeed the overall impression of the page's balance of black and white. And I probably spoke to soon: that was just my gut response, and until I see this font in a text setting and printed, I won't know how I feel about its color. <BR> <BR><i>i am unsure about the t myself, but i don't know how to do it yet. is it right that the cross bar has to be x-height?</i> <BR> <BR>The t's height and crossbar are all right, I think you just need to work on the curve of the tail. It feels too narrow. <BR> <BR><i>s is (as expected) my big problem child  i just don't know how to do it right. do you think it should rise more steeply?  <BR>at the moment, it's too small as well. </i> <BR> <BR>The curve in the middle of the s should be thinner</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for the tip with the &quot;y&quot;, Hrant. <BR>maybe i am just a bit too consequent when trying to follow the guidelines i imposed on myself. <BR>i will try your solution, maybe they are useful when working on the uppercase too (comparing your &quot;j&quot; und &quot;J&quot;. <BR> <BR>i also like your &quot;g&quot;, as i was irresolute about giving it a modern form or an old-styled with loop. your &quot;g&quot; is something in between.</div>
