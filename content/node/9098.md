  body: I needed to do some Peter Rabbit-related stuff years ago and ended up making
    my own font by modifiying Cochin. I don&#39;t know what the real font is called
    and I suspect it may be either custom or something old and obscure.

  body: Thanks for the input Mark. Seems to be a bit of a stumper as no one else has
    piped in.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m actually looking for fonts used in 19th century childrens&#39;
    books, primarily for display copy in a current book of short stories. The stories
    are rather unsettling and very clearly for adults but are about some rather messed
    up pre-teens, so I want to play off the uptight Victorian aesthetic of those old,
    didactic children&#39;s books. Beatrix Potter was just a place to begin. <BR>
    <BR>Let me know if anyone has any leads or ideas I might pursue...
