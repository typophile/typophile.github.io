  article</a href> recently in The New York Times and I thought you all might find
  this interesting. Particularly students, or those interested in information design,
  and environmental graphics/typography.\r\n\r\nJames Montalbano, a Typophile frequenter
  is featured in this article. A great article! On a somewhat personal note, James
  and Don are to a large degree partially responsible for my interest in typography
  and information design. Congrats guys! I wish you continued success!"
