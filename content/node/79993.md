  body: "Thanks for the links, Justin. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking it's a font since the
    image I posted is from B.A.D.'s \"Contact\" single from 1989. Whether or not the
    font is available in digital form is another matter."

    it at that can be seen at 2.52."

  body: "Justin, I think you're right that the iron-on letters were used for the cover.\r\n\r\nYeah,
    it says \"MEGATOP PHOENIX\" and \"B.A.D.\" on the back of his shirt. There's also
    this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/usnorth-copyweb_3982.gif]\r\n"
