  body: Sari has wider proportions and to me the curves have lost their tautness and
    bounce. The pound sign and @ are different (nicer in Barmeno in my opinion). Sari
    has oldstyle figures.

  body: It's Sari in both the links. The M has splayed legs. The leg on R is also
    curved in Sari, though that doesn't appear anywhere here.
