  seems to know if it was a font or custom art. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41565.jpg"

  days on websites and the closest thing I&#39;ve seen is Iona or Maxim but that mostly
  matches on only the R and the B. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, <BR>Bill Dubis

  body: Bill, I&#39;m very sorry nobody got back to you yet, but that probably  <BR>means
    we&#39;re all stumped. I for one haven&#39;t got a clue what this  <BR>could be.
    My initial gut feeling tells me this is custom lettered,  <BR>but maybe there
    are typefaces that are similar.

  body: Thanks for the reply Yves.  I ended up playing with an .eps file to get a
    graphic I could use.  I was hoping it was a font so I could get a much cleaner
    look. <BR> <BR>Take care,  <BR>Bill
