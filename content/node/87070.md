body: "One of my dream projects is to design the Mushaf (the Quran in print). In searching
  for a digital version of the Quran over the internet, I came across Abdul Samee'
  Rajab Salem,who calls himslef Abdo, and is an Egyptian typographer. Abdo has devised
  a prorpriety font to render the text of the Quran, which he named \"Mushaf Misr\"
  or the Mushaf of Egypt.\r\n\r\nWhat caught my attention is the high resemblence
  of the font he devised to that of Mushaf Al Madina, which is rendered using calligraphy.
  The letter forms are very balanced and elegant, and capture much of the beauty of
  the calligraphic version.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mushafmisrmed_6568.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  was interested in communicating with Abdo, and eventually I agreed with him to conduct
  an interview and publish it on my blog [[http://arabictype.wordpress.com|arabictype.wordpress.com]].\r\n\r\nAnother
  interesting thing that I discovered about Abdo is his way of designing the font.
  Abdo based his design on a digital calligraphic scheme where he uses the digitizer
  as a calligrapher would use his pen. His glyphs are based on paths that exhibit
  calligraphic charatersitics such as the ductus contrast among others. He does not
  design the glyphs using outlines.\r\n\r\nAbdo called the approach \"digital calligraphy\",
  and further search on the internet led me to [[http://inkscape.org|Inkscape]], which
  is OpenSource software that provides a calligraphy feature. Something worth investigating."
