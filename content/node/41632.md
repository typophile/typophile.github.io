body: "I'm looking at the control points of Trajan Pro, and I noticed something interesting.
  On the outer line, the apex has the control point. That makes sense to me, since
  that point is in extrema. But can someone explain to me why the apex of the inner
  line has the points on either side rather than in extrema?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trajan_5930.gif]"

  body: "Probably just forgot it.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are times when adding a node
    changes the shape too much. For really small curves, sometimes the closest location
    on the UPM grid isn't close enough to where you would want it."

  body: "I guess I should mention that this is the letter A. \r\n\r\n@Cerulean\r\nI
    figured that it might have something to do with size. That curve is super tiny
    at regular type size, so maybe that might have something to do with it?"

  body: Perhaps this is an example where breaking the "Rules" worked. Further, maybe
    it's a mistake. Try doing tests & see what you get.

  body: "The top extrema point is necessary for hinting against the alignment zone.\r\nThe
    lower extrema is omitted because it is not necessary for hinting, and because
    in that small acute space, on a 1000 unit em, it would make it difficult to draw
    a smooth curve."
