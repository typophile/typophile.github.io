    font for a novel?

    I would say, is unfortunately not one of them.) The choice is an artistic as well
    as a practical one. Choose something that speaks subtly to the feel of the novel
    that you are trying to capture in your design. The same goes for size and leading
    \u2014 that's the art of typography, and as the designer you should feel confident
    to trust your instincts and use your visual judgment. That said, as a starting
    point, 10 point type on 12 point leading is standard, or maybe even a little smaller,
    for novels. And just to give you some possible leads, from several different styles
    and periods: Minion, Garamond Premier, Electra, Palatino, Baskerville, Jenson,
    Dolly, Stone, Caslon, Quadraat, Mrs Eaves, etc. etc. etc. \r\n\r\n* I think you
    meant serif, not sans."

    try out some of those fonts and try in 10 point type (I was using 11pt so far)\r\nThanks
    again"

  body: "\"10 point type on 12 point leading is standard, or maybe even a little smaller,
    for novels.\"\r\n\r\nThat's a questionable statement, from my point of view. An
    optimal size and leading ratio differs from one typeface to each other, and depends,
    among other things, by the instrinsic traits of each typeface. I mean, setting
    a text in Miller on 10 points will give you a *very* different result than, say,
    a text set in Adobe Garamond in the same size. Instead I would say, from my limited
    experience, that 11 points is a better readable size for novels, esays or poems.
    So the first advice is: do some layout tests with serifs with different qualities
    and features, print the pages and then proceed with gradual adjustments."

    can work very small, tracked). Off the top of my head: try Paperback. But: what
    Joshua said - what's the novel about?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    immediately thinking [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/paperback/fontspecimens|Paperback]],
    too. \r\nI always wanted to use it, cool italics plus optical sizes. I guess it
    could fit for a very wide range of topics."
