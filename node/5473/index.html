		<div class="commentbody">This article completely fails to understand and explain the situation, instead quoting people (eg from Razorfish) on a subject (font economics) they know nothing about.  <BR> <BR>(Yeah, we should get a union &ndash; except as self-employed workers, that would consitute a cartel in the US, which is why illustrators and photographers don't have unions.)   <BR> <BR>If Chank's font is used by a third party (a small design firm) to create a piece of artwork, say, the wordmark for a campaign, for a large corporation, he &quot;sells&quot; one font licence to the supplier, no matter how many times the wordmark is reproduced by that supplier's client.  <BR> <BR>If the large corporation installs his font on all its corporate computers, so that all its in-house marketing departments can use it for ongoing typesetting for their ID and marketing, then he can sell a multi-user licence for a far higher price. And if the typeface has a family, that helps sales too. <BR> <BR>This is, one would assume, what happened in the $6,000 Ocean Spray &quot;deal&quot; (ie contract) mentioned in the article, but the writer doesn't explain why &quot;negotiated directly&quot; is so much more lucrative, leaving it open to suggestion that it's all about Chank's mythical Elvis-like charisma and Donald-ish powers of negotiation. <BR> <BR>Chank has the right idea. As long as fonts are durable tools, type designers will have a tough, competitive retail market . <BR> <BR>If we can make fonts totally ephemeral consumable fashion items, that's a better much market. <BR> <BR>Rockstar fonts is a start, but the real money is in licensing deals with the celebrity du jour. Anyone know Paris Hilton's email address?  <BR> <BR>Or, just suppose, Joe Teen buys a new pair of Shaq-endorsed sneakers, and they come with the new Shaq blackletter font (on mini-CD) which he can use in all his emails (or school essays).  <BR> <BR>Jim &ndash; do you have the rights to Beckham's latest tattoo yet? Are you negotiating with Cristiano for space on his chest? Get on the job, man!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>In a world of post-punk distressed-fontmeisters, says  <BR>Stephen Turbek of Razorfish, Diesel's work stands out because  <BR>of his range. Turbek says Diesel's work shows the mixture of  <BR>&quot;love of machines and ironic futurism&quot; that is emblematic of his  <BR>peers' aesthetic. &quot;My generation is in the age when everybody  <BR>thought the future would have already happened.&quot;</i> <BR> <BR>AND <BR> <BR><i>&quot;It's a really difficult business,&quot; Turbek observes. &quot;When you  <BR>buy software, you get a box. If you're buying fonts online, all  <BR>you get is bits.&quot; He suggests that in the age of digital  <BR>distribution, fontographers might consider forming a union.</i> <BR> <BR>Seven years ago (1997!) when Stephen Turbek said that, he  <BR>wasn't a designer. He was one of those early fish that had the  <BR>&quot;billable&quot; people wondering what he actually did. Of course that  <BR>was a time when it was okay to have those kind of people on the  <BR>payroll.</div>
