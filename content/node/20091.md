  educational and instructional materials, particularly those known as reusable learning
  objects, such as Flash movies, interactive or otherwise. I am seeking examples of
  animated typographic pieces, these could be interactive, artistic and/or educational.
  As an example of the type of items that I'm seeking, there are some basic interactive
  animations included under the 'anatomy' section of this site: http://www.rsub.com/typographic/
  and an artistic piece here: http://www.arabictypography.com/flash.html (to view
  click one of the lighter moving squares)\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows of other such sites
  and would like to share, I'd be grateful. Thanks."

  body: "Here is my little contribution, T bones. Two or three years ago, I had to
    create some content for an online course about typography for beginners. All the
    stuff is currently on an open and distance learning platform and is only avalaible
    for registered trainees (and everything is in french). But tell me if you are
    interested and I will send you a login and a password.\r\n\r\nYou can also have
    a look at two files posted on my own website. The <a href=\"http://www.pixels-et-papier.be/pages/Mep.html\">first
    one</a> is an attempt to explain the basic principles of page layout to non-designers.
    It is based on the books of Robin Williams and made in Flash. It is also only
    in french.\r\n\r\nThe second one is <a href=\"http://www.pixels-et-papier.be/pages/FontExpert.html\">
    a small application</a> dedicated to fonts exploration. This one is in french
    and  english. Comments and critics about the content (and about my mistakes in
    english) are welcome."

      learning platform, despite my poor French language skills. Many thanks, Tim.
