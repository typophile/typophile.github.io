body: A few years ago I designed some faceplates for an audio company that included
  a numbered dial. I discovered that most Postscript fonts have the numeral &#34;1&#34;
  extend slightly below the bounding box. This looks good in body text, but as the
  number &#34;10&#34; floating in space, the one and zero look like different sizes.  <BR>
  <BR>Anyway, I just decided to scrap all software for this project and hand-coded
  directly into Postscript. This got around the bounding box issue and I was also
  able to mathematically plot the dial positions. <BR> <BR>Has anyone else here typed
  &#34;showpage&#34; and had fun with raw Postscript?
