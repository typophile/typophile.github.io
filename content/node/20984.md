    Abba at all their athletic events</a>.

    shirts looked like an after-thought - like the Helvetica '20' on the front of
    the $20 bill. \r\n\r\nhttp://soccernet.espn.go.com/team?id=449&cc=5901 "

  body: "> Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink \r\n\r\nYeah, I saw that guys shirt in the last
    match they played. He uses all three parts as a last name, so it starts near his
    waist, goes up to the neck, and then all the way back down again.\r\n\r\nTo the
    original question, I like the Auzzie shirts (the first #9) in the images. The
    number font doesn't look as impressive up close, but it was very cool looking
    from fan/tv viewer range."

  body: "those Puma (?) shirts with that all-lowercase font are horrible, and with
    every other team using them it just makes it all the worse.\r\n\r\nSweden's is
    a daring choice, but it doesn't fit at all and it's barely legible. no idea what
    Stephen is talking about it being stuck in the 70s though.. that font looks pretty
    futuristic to me, and not in a 70s type of futuristic way either.\r\n\r\ncall
    me a traditionalist, but i like Mexico. Mexico and football seems to equal triline/biline
    fonts (just look at the art for when they hosted the tournament). classy and retro-cool."

  body: The numbers on the Nike and Adidas shirts are so disappointing; but I am happy
    that I at least succeeded to make someone laugh about the Dutch shirts. Humor
    is the best way to survive bad typography :-)
