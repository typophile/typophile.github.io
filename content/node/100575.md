  body: "and to be honest, from the skew of the shot it can be hard to be certain.
    the designer of Open Sans states it's a Humanist font, and they all look quite
    similar. i'd guess it may just depend on some very tiny detail that may not be
    apparent with the letters in your sample, or a weight needed that is available
    in one font but not another.\r\n\r\nin specific, the lowercase r may be a telltale
    character, or perhaps the roundness of the bowl in the d. \r\n"
