  logo that I've recently created.\r\nIt's for a local DJ called \"dynamike\" He is
  mainly into Hip Hop and House Music, but he doesn't want his logo to look \"ghetto\"
  so no Graffiti or Tag  wordmark could be used here.\r\n\r\nthe logo itself says
  the DJ name (dynamike) and has got 4 splines (word?!) following it..\r\nthose splines
  symbolize the splines of a Vinyl but also an explosion (dynamiKe)\r\n\r\nsome c&c
  would be nice\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dynamike.jpg]\r\n\r\nUPDATE......\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dynamike2.jpg]\r\n\r\nANOTHER

  body: First that pops into my mind is that letter 'm' looks crammed, I think it
    should be wider.

  body: "To me it doesn't really develop the dynamic side of the name, the splines/grooves
    should expand from the same centre point and possibly enlarge, while the weight
    of the stroke increases as they explode, so you get a v-shaped wedge. I would
    also move the centre of the radii to the vertical centre of the x-height. The
    legs of the k and the a, e and i look a bit too rounded rather than using a similar
    terminal style that is used on the others, and as Jan said the m is too narrow.
    Have you tried a vertical style?\r\nTim"

  body: "It's funny, my first reading of the name was as a play on 'dynamic'.\r\n\r\nI
    agree about the 'm' feeling cramped. Also, the radiating curves are pretty dead.
    As Tim said, they don't feel explosive or dynamic. Even the grooves in a record
    change width and rhythm. A good DJ can read them and find bass lines and breaks,
    so that might be something to play with. Anything to enliven the rhythm.\r\n\r\nBuilding
    on the shapes in the terminals, I suggest that you modify them to give the whole
    word a more directional feel, particularly since there are curves 'blasting' and
    'radiating' outward from the right side. Some of the terminals are oriented inward
    in relation to each other, like on the 'n' and 'm'. Try customizing the characters
    to work in that specific word, rather than as an alphabet for any word.\r\n\r\nYou've
    got a good starting concept that you should punch up and really push in new visual
    directions."

    all look in the same direction, definitely gives it a more dynamic feel.. \r\n\r\nI'm
    not too sure about the radiation curves / grooves though.. some help would be
    nice..\r\n\r\n@tim.. I've also made a vertical wordmark.. looks ok.. doesn't remind
    me of a dynamite stick.. \r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://sile.dhcp.at/dynamike2.jpg\">\r\nhere's

    1) Sound and 2) Grooves in a record. They look like part of the identity now rather
    than just a series of brackets after the name. '

  body: "I'd recommend playing with the spacing of the grooves just a bit. Plus the
    curves seem at little shakey, in a not-intentional way (maybe it just appears
    that way at this small screen size, hard to tell?). If you could make them perfect
    circle-segments, then tweak the spacing a bit, you'd be almost there. Is the \"m\"
    still a little cramped? Spacing is a little off between a-m and m-i. The e might
    need a click to the left as well, but personally, I'd rather add a click between
    each letter except the t-e and m-i.\r\nLooking good though.\r\nAlso, I'm thinking
    people may overlook your updated file/progress. You might post it up top with
    a new name to be more visible?"

    think it needs to be at least one and a half times the width of the n, but the
    grooves look better apart from the concerns raised by Greg, I wonder if they should
    also have rounded ends.\r\nTim"

    sections of related concentric ovals or circles, something <a href=\"http://www.olegvolk.net/gallery/various/concentric\">like
    this</a>. You'll find that they feel more inherently and organically cohesive.

    space isn't centred on the height of the curves, the bottom \"halves\" look smaller
    to me. It also acts a horizon which doesn't appear centred on the x-height, especially
    with the horizontal element of the bottom of the e, \u2013 it needs to move down
    a gnat's. Have you tried expanding the space as the curve expands from the original?\r\nTim"

    of the waves? The waves aren't terribly meaningful and are on every other logo
    these days it seems.
