  old TV series 'The Dukes of Hazzard' (1979; [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078607/|imbd-link]]).\r\n\r\nOne
  (or two) would be the lettering on the car, General Lee, especially the <strong>'01'</strong>
  on the side of the car, as depicted in the attachment. And I was wondering if the
  font of the letters differs from the font of the ciphers 01 (unfortunately, I could
  not find any decent images for the letters, just [[http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c214/orange01/dukes_of_hazzard.jpg|this
  one]] or [[http://www.prnewswire.com/mnr/cmt/21313/images/21313a.jpg|this one]]).\r\n\r\nThe
  other font would be the logo of the series, as depicted [[http://www2.warnerbros.com/dukesofhazzard/img/splash/DH_Splash_left_p2_off.jpg|here]]
  or [[http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0001WTWXI.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg|here]].\r\n\r\nBut
  I'm guessing that would be a custom made one..\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nalex.\r\n"
