  around.\r\n\r\nCan't seem to do this in indesign though.  All I find is align with
  page and margins, otherwise it always alights with the upper left object in a group
  selected.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    (Object > Lock Position). Then select all your objects and use an Align command;
    they should align to that locked one.\r\n\r\nSee if that does what you want.\r\n\r\n"

  body: that works to align, but doesn't let me distribute the spacing.

  body: "How do you want to distribute? \r\n\r\nAlign first, unlock \"key\", then
    Distribute. Or Align, then unlock \"key\", lock two outer members of distribution,
    then Distribute.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly are you trying to accomplish?"
