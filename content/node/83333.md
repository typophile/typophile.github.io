    what's with the foot serifs: adnate on the left, and on the right what I call

    the salt!)\r\n\r\n\u2022 I don't understand the serifs! Will their shape be visible
    at target size?\r\n\u2022 Favourite glyphs /b/, /g/, /s/ and /y/. \r\n\u2022 R
    looks a bit top heavy, maybe that's intentional? If so, make it more top heavy?\r\n\u2022
    Is the lining zero a bit pointy?\r\n\u2022 There's something cuspy going on in
    the top of the counters of B, E, F, P, R and S (but not D). It's not pronounced
    enough to be a feature, but is poking my eye just enough to be something. Also
    check your lovely ampersand, there's a glitch on the arm.\r\n\u2022 G may need
    a pointier spur to harmonise with b, q and @. Is @ a bit too pointy?\r\n\u2022
    Foot spurs on /d/ and /u/ may be a bit clotty? Perhaps trim the inside of the
    spur and/or make the notch taller?\r\n\u2022 Descender of /j/ may be a bit of
    a loose curve? Similar story with /f/. Maybe that's just my preference though.\r\n\u2022
    Foot of /f/ in /fl/ has got mangled.\r\n\u2022 Arm of /k/ looks to start a bit
    high up the stem.\r\n\u2022 Comma/quotes I'd make the tail much longer...as you
    know I obsess about commas!\r\n\u2022 Bold looks newsy, regular looks booky, somehow,
    is that because of the higher contrast in the bold? \r\n\u2022 Check bold /u/'s
    width. Actually the regular /u/ may also work slightly narrower. \r\n\u2022 Bold
    /g/'s ear may need to move upwards to prevent crashing/splotching.\r\n\u2022 Lining
    numerals are splendid. 6 may need a bigger bowl. \r\n\u2022 + is a little meek.

    Yes, the tilt of the ampersand is something I only noticed in Century when I started

    its shape too (though it is much better in that respect than the '\xE6' it replaced),
    the way those two thick stems meeting from opposite directions is not graceful
    to these eyes, and that left-turned tear terminal has no precedence in your italics.
    Lastly, this glyph is somehow two-storey in the back and one-storey in the front.
    That will not look harmonious in settings with a lot of '\xE6's. Try these sentences:
    \"L\xE6rerens n\xE6rv\xE6r i ern\xE6rinsl\xE6retimen\" (standard Bokm\xE5l) or

    to release in the interpolated spectrum between them. Perhaps this would wind

    pity that it doesn't quite fit this typeface. I must ask though, why do you insist
    on the spectacle /g/ for the italic while your problem with g_y is so easily solved

    I think I would still rather see a one-story /g/ in the Italic. I love how the

    its own is not bad; it's that the arm is also curved and then has this chunky

    leg, whereas in the new one it starts from the very origin of the leg. (God is
    this hard to explain!) Let the strokes encompassing the leg dance parallelly a
    bit longer.\r\n\r\nDave's suggestion for the eye of /k, which he nicely illustrated
    in his comment, will IMO definitely make that /k go from looking good to looking
    great (once and for all!). I realize you want to keep the leg and the eye as two
    independent components (for the sake of consistency, because the regular shows
    this feature, as if the pen was \"lifted\" in between). I think you can keep this
    feature while also making Dave and me happy. The problem is that the straight
    edge of the leg seems to be pushing the loop of the eye to the right. Nevertheless,
    the loop does not necessarily have to join the leg at the very edge. Changing
    that would concede the loop a bit more concavity, which is what Dave wants.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    this all makes sense. Otherwise I should follow Dave's example and start drawing
    more and writing less..."

      them in the numerals and (more of) the upper case? This also applies to the
      very short straight line to the west of 'e'.</blockquote>\r\nI can tell you
      the thinking, though I don't know that it serves as justification. At some point
      in the development I had the idea of cleaning up all the counters so that they
      had a simple geometry based on symmetry (so, for example, /b/'s counter is an
      oval rather that being straight on the stemside). I was particularly intrigued
      with what this meant for the /n/ (and other humped letters), which if there
      was to be a corner at the join, there would be a corner opposite, too. But the
      outer contour would simply arch around smoothly, and the mass as a whole would
      read as a pretty conventional arch--the corner in the arch would be \"subliminal\"\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/countersymmetry_4904.png]\r\nFrom
      there I decided to see how far the symmetrical-counter idea could be stretched.
      I wrestled it into the /g/, which I like. It was already there in letters like
      /e/. For the closed counter of /a/, the symmetry could divide the drop-shaped
      counter diagonally. The /K/'s counters could be up-down mirror images of each
      other, at least near the middle of the glyph. \r\nFrom the /n/ I redrew the
      /r/ to have the same symmetrical arch underneath. I tried to do the same with
      /a/ and with /f/, but I probably hit the point of diminishing returns somewhere
      in there. The /f/ in particular feels like an outlier now. (The conceit is most
      obvious in \"branching\" structures which explains why it's less evident in
      figures and caps.)\r\n<blockquote>Is 'a' (very) slightly wide?</blockquote>\r\nI
      think it was, particularly in the display master. How's this?:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/awidth_4884.png]\r\n<blockquote>Is
      'u' slightly tall?</blockquote>\r\nIt's the same as the similar stem tops in
      /n/m/r/etc., which raises the question whether they too are too tall. I have
      now lowered the top point of those stems a few points, and also taken out the
      bulge of that long segment at the the top. What do you think?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uheight_3805.png]\r\n
      <blockquote>Are 'w' and 'y' a little light and dark, respectively? Is the right
      part of 'V's right serif too short?</blockquote>\r\nYes on all counts. How's
      this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vowellyusethis_4766.png]\r\n<blockquote>Why
      do 'i', 'l' 'h' et al have sanded-off right-tops?</blockquote>\r\nI think I
      liked the idea of the top angle being a right angle, rather than acute. Almost
      like a mirror of baseline serifs, though bent over a bit. Does it bug you?\r\n<blockquote>Why
      are 's' serifs so dissimilar?</blockquote>\r\nI think that detail reflects my
      efforts to have the face be both classic and fresh. The full barb at the top
      feels more traditional, the cleaner solution at the bottom more modern, and
      I think maybe having them both be one or the other carries the letter too far
      over to that side.\r\n<blockquote>Should '&'s arm be straighter?</blockquote>\r\n
      What do you think of this?:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ampersands_3619.png]\r\n<blockquote>five.lining's
      serif is very heavy, and the top of the curve much lighter than its OSF sibling's.</blockquote>\r\nAgreed
      on the curves; by the serif do you mean the teardrop at the bottom, or the one
      at upper right?\r\n<blockquote>Also, the characters of the two fours are maybe
      too different for one typeface?</blockquote>\r\nHmm, maybe. If you were to make
      them more similar, which structure would you work with?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fours_3774.png]\r\n\r\nResponses

        But maybe the teardrop in the top example is slightly light?\r\n\r\nAbout
        the 'u' height: I always end up with the 'u' top serifs slightly different
        from the 'inmh' top serifs, the left one a little shorter (and therefore a
        little steeper), the right one a little longer (to close the countershape

        it obeys the x height. Just thinking out aloud here. Your new treatment looks

        Much more in character, I think. \r\n\r\nI'd strongly prefer the closed four

    /a/ junctions are reworked a bit and counters are rotated very slightly\r\n- /z/

    with yet. I don't mind a little stiffness in this face, though I think it's a
    pretty homely letter on its own now. It's actually pretty directly a rotated /n/.
    And both are, again, based on a symmetrical counter (there's a canted, symmetrical,
    sort of parabolic arc in the counter). I'll probably try some more tweaking. You're
    absolutely right that italic /u/s are difficult!\r\n- /Z/ in Zap shows the same
    glyph with the crossbar removed. I think at least in the higher contrast masters
    (#2 bold and #3 display) that long skinny diagonal gets awfully long without the
    relieving weight of the crossbar. So if just removing it doesn't work, one option
    would be giving up on the thin-diagonal structure (i.e. adopting the thick-diagonal
    structure of the roman). But I like the challenge of trying to get the thick horizontals
