body: "The type design I'm currently working on has regular caps that serve as lead
  caps, swash caps, and a set of capitals designed to set for all cap settings. \r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to figure out which feature tag to put these in. I had thought it would be
  good to use some sort of contextual feature so that if more than one cap were typed
  in a row the lead caps would be substituted by the all caps set. I also have ligatures
  designed for the all caps set. The all caps are just slightly shorter than lead
  caps so that they line up well, but they are not really small enough to declare
  as small caps, so I would be hesitant to use that tag even though it might logically
  serve the purpose.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

    to use. You could sub them in CASE, or, even though it might not be semantically
    correct, TITL. '

  body: I would make these contextual within either 'titl' or a stylistic set feature
    (or both).

  body: "'titl' sounds like a good choice. I wasn't entirely sure which features worked
    with contextual substitution, but that would certainly make it easier on the user
    end.\r\n\r\nThanks, John and Jackson."

  body: In theory, you should be able to put contextual lookups into any feature.
