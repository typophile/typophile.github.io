  body: "Credere, obbedire, combattere (\u201CBelieve, Obey, Fight\u201D)\r\nI tried
    to find a font that matched 1. The specific boxy structure. 2. The ratio between
    height and width, 4. The stroke weight, and 5. The fascist mood.\r\nI suggest
    Linotype Case Study No 1 Pro Bold  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/case-study-no-one-lt/
    The main difference is the squared corners in the counters -- which in my opinion
    adds to the feeling of fascist harshness. The main editing changes for an excellent
    match are to narrow the _M_, clip the serifs on I and shorten the middle stroke
    on the E. \r\nUse the modified font for a Fascist slogan like Se avanzo, seguitemi;
    se indietreggio, uccidetemi; se muoio, vendicatemi (\u201CIf I advance, follow
    me. If I retreat, kill me. If I die, avenge me\u201D) and it's almost overpowering.
    For better or worse, few people think or talk like that today. More Italian Fascist
    slogans at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Fascism#Italian_Fascist_slogans\r\nDon"

  body: "Lovely answer, Don. I'm fascinated. :-)\r\nPoint is, I'm thinking of using
    a similar font for an insignia of a 1940's italian caf\xE9, today turned into
    a mittleuropean style, high-end wine bar/bistro.\r\nI intend to maintain the middle
    1900 feel since it all started then, and the bar also is part of the official
    \"historical bar\" association.\r\nDo you think these fonts are too much politically/historically
    connotated in relation to fascist era and I may miss the traditional 1900 feel?\r\nThanks\r\n"

    the period.

  body: "I am totally incompetent to answer a question about current or past Italian
    political culture. Years ago I did read some books on the Italian Fascist experience.
    Recently I watched the DVD on the TV mini-series  Il commissario De Lucaon [Inspector
    De Luca] and was captivated by the stylistic mood. Saw lots of period piece movies
    too.\r\nAll this being said, Fascism dominated the style of mid 1900s Italy --
    at least until 1945 -- and I would have no hesitation for using this boxy lettering
    for the era. BTW don't lose the squared leg on the R. Also, a  nuanced Trajan
    style Roman or a flowing script would be so wrong for the era. I detest period
    recreations with lettering that is anachronistic.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Hi Bob, I share your concern over the digital issue. Case Study No. One is
    a superbly executed font. Some variation and roughening of the outlines -- not
    a lot -- would really add to the impact. Perhaps generate the letters for phrases
    as images and do this in Photoshop or similar program.\r\nDon"

    my own country in many ways and shapes, (lots of buildings are still there, the
    architecture seems to scream out the same slogans through its shapes.), but No
    One is totally missing the flavour I am trying to maintain.\r\nSometimes, incredibly,
    being a native Italian can be very helpful.\r\nI can send drafts for you to judge,
