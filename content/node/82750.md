body: I am in the process of developing a logo and website for my company.  The company
  does branding, web development, and marketing for small businesses.  I hand drew
  this logo and reworked it in illustrator.  I wanted it to have fresh energy and
  inspire people to get creative and excited about developing their identity.  How
  am  doing so far?

    and the dots on the i apear to have a nose. I don't know if that is the effect
    that you intended. Somehow I find that a bit awkward.\r\n\r\nMaybe some of your
    letters are a bit too consistent in stroke width.\r\n\r\nThe a just doesn't seem
    to fit in. Maybe you should explorer some new curves!\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n"
