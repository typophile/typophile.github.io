  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">China Type Design Ltd.has customized a set of Chinese typefaces for the Oxford University Press China for its Simplified Chinese version of the Oxford Advanced Learner's English-Chinese Dictionary, Seventh Edition. Together, the fonts comprise about 35,000 characters, including customized characters that were added to meet special dictionary usage requirements.

The DictSungHKS™ Light font, developed for the publication of the Simplified Chinese edition, was customized based on China Type’s MSungHKS™ Light font. The company’s MHeiHKS™ Bold font was also applied to the special headings and labels. Both fonts are based on the OpenType® font format and conform to the Unicode™ Standard of multilingual digital information exchange. The typefaces also support the Big5 Chinese character encoding system. More than 3,000 characters were added to the DictSungHKS-Light font to achieve full coverage of the Hong Kong supplementary character set. Special characters were added to meet the customized requirements for dictionary usage. Also, aesthetic characteristics were enhanced to complement the writing style of the latest national character set standard of the Peoples Republic of China, GB 18030-2005. 

Oxford University Press China is completing the Simplified Chinese edition of the dictionary in a traditional Chinese desktop environment, the same setup that was applied to the Orthodox Chinese edition. Both dictionaries are based on the same typographic design, which adheres to a specific house style. While the Orthodox Chinese edition is intended for students and advance English learners in regions such as Hong Kong and Taiwan, where Orthodox Chinese is used, the upcoming Simplified Chinese edition is aimed at Mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore, as well as other regions where Simplified Chinese is used.
