  developing. \r\nThe font in use is [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museo.html|Museo
  by ExLjbris Font Foundry]] (the free weight), with some character merging applied
  by me.\r\nWhile I like the \"ALMA\" part, I'm not satisfied with the \"beautiful
  security\" [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motto|motto]] below.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion
  will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nA."

  body: "I think this doesn't work too well for several reasons. The ligatures you
    created make the word ALMA hard to read, as the L becomes an I. The Beautiful
    Security is unevenly spaced, and there is a huge gap between the words. My advice
    would be to try to work on the logo and typography first in black only, as it
    makes it easier to judge if the shapes and proportions are allright. Also try
    many different versions, placements etc and print them out big. Pin these on a
    wall and leave it there for a while. After this you can start looking at the colour
    scheme.\r\n\r\nGood luck"

- body: "I agree with Quenteau, this doesn't work for several reasons. The colors
    you've chosen combined with the unnecessary outlines look like a kids sports team
    - oh, and Quenteau is also right about working strictly in black & white before
    adding color. It's the only way to flush out a solid design. \r\n\r\nAside from
    all the technical/visual missteps, it doesn't convey <em>security</em> at all,
    and as a result, it doesn't inspire potential users to trust the application.
    IMHO, this is a huge problem for security software. Look around at the big names
    in security (not just software; look at banks, law enforcement, alarm companies,
    etc.) and learn from their success. \r\n\r\nIf you chose Museo simply because
    you like it, well, that's the wrong reason to choose a font. Make at least a dozen
    draft logos - each one a fresh idea wholly different from the last - before you
    focus in for refinements. Unless you do that, you'll waste a lot of time trying
    to force something to work based on something emotional like loving a great font.
    A logo is not a font showcase, it's the voice of your product. What does your
    product want to tell its potential customers? Does Museo say that? I love Museo...but
    I don't think it works for your product. Can you convince me otherwise?"

  body: "Now, Lex, not so harsh.\r\n\r\nI guess it's hard to give advice out of the
    blue. Best advice is look around, to other businesses, in books, at typefaces.
    Try to define what program it is in visual terms. Then try diffrent things, just
    sketching. Then come back here and we can give some more feedback.\r\n\r\nAnd
    have fun!"

  body: "I'd suggest looking at bank logos. They tend to look solid (at least they
    used to).\r\n\r\nTry to define what the logo has to communicate then try to say
    that with images. Maybe try to mix two concepts together (a safe and a computer
    pop into my mind [although maybe it's a little obvious]). Think about different
    concepts, so you'll end up with lots of choices. and then we can pitch in and
    guide you in the right direction.\r\n\r\nHope this helps and good luck!"

  body: 'What does the motto <em>beautiful security</em> refer to? The qualities people
    generally value in security are strength, reliability, comprehensiveness, and
    ease of use--not beauty. Since you''re using beauty to differentiate your product
    from other security applications, think about what attributes of your product
    a user would find beautiful, and make a logo that visually embodies those attributes. '

    you encrypt something, forget your encryption password, go like \"AAAAAAAHAHAHA!!!!\",
    then \"Wait a minute... wasn't it 'password?'\" and it decrypts!. \r\n\r\nAnd
    you are like \"Ahhhh... bea-u-ti-ful.\"\r\n\r\n:)"

    security]] refers to the interpretation of security meaning. For an organization,
    security if often a burden, something you have to cope with only for compliance
    purposes. A correct understanding of security, however, will add value to IT systems
    and enhance the overall operations of both the IT and management staff.\r\n\r\n<em>[I'm
