body: Hi, I am new to CS3 illustrator. In my old mac/old illustrator, I used to be
  able to put a box around it to nudge it around and stretch it a bit if needed. I
  cannot figure out how to do this.  Thanks for your help, (I need step by step. Its
  amazing what you can forget in 2 years).

    once in a while. Today, I wish I never gave away my old computer set up and programs
    on craiglist... A manual did not come with CS3.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated. "

    tool (its the  tool that looks like the black arrow, the shortcut is V) it should
    bring up a box with transform handles which you can click and drag as needed.

  body: "Thanks for comments. this forum is saving my sanity. I found what I needed.
    \r\nIt is the \"Free Transform\" Tool under the scaling tool on palette. It gives
    me that box I need. \r\n\r\nI agree with stretching. I have always maximally hated
    it, it looks totally amateur. It's so offensive to me it makes my lower digits
    cringe. I understand about lettering and type, and it is a high aesthetic indeed,
    thats why I'm excited to find this forum! Type people like me!"
