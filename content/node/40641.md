body: "\u2003This is from a book printed in the mid \u201960s, on a typesetting machine
  that allowed for ligatures (I\u2019ve seen some \u2018\uFB03\u2019s) but not kerning\u2014even
  the italic is unkerned.\u2002My scanner doesn\u2019t work under Linux, so I have
  a photo; if higher quality is needed for an ID I\u2019ll scan it again.\r\n\u2003Some
  features of the font I\u2019ve noticed:\r\n\u2022\u2002The leg of the `Q' begins
  on the bottom-outside of the circle.\r\n\u2022\u2002Quotes & apostrophes are smaller
  than the commas.\r\n\u2022\u2002Four-headed `W' with separate serifs.\r\n\u2022\u2002The
  left leg of the `M' is slightly slanted, the right leg is straight.\r\n\u2022\u2002The
  square brackets `[]' have curved tops & bottoms and little something-or-others on
  their sides.\r\n\u2003I'll try whatthefont again after I get a high-quality scan;
  right now it's just suggesting distressed fonts.\r\n\u2014Joel\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Just_in_Time_6690.png]"

  body: "&emsp;Identifont suggested some Garamonds, but I didn't see the specific
    square bracket on them.&ensp;Garamond&nbsp;3 or American Garamond or something
    similar looks to be it.\r\n&emsp;Anybody know which version was in use on kerning-challenged
    typesetting machines <em>circa</em> 1965?\r\n\u2014Joel"
