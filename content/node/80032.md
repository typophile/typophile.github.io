body: "When I use the Adobe CS programs on a PC and I am trying to use Helvetica,
  what looks like the standard roman version of Helvetica is labeled as Helvetica
  Medium? But when looking to see if Helvetica Medium is a font that can be purchased
  online I cannot find it?\r\nSo what is Helvetica Medium? Where did it come from?
  and is it an actual font that can be purchased?\r\n\r\nAnd no, I'm not getting this
  confused with Helvetica Neue 65 Medium, I understand that they are separate typefaces.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts??? "

  body: "Helvetica Medium = the standard roman version of Helvetica.\r\n\r\nAdobe's
    apps get their name info from other parts of the font than traditional Windows
    apps. And in fact for PostScript Type 1 fonts that Adobe has in their library,
    they have a table to look up the \"correct\" typographic name. So it doesn't necessarily
    match what you see in other apps.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    documents written that describe this?\r\n\r\nI inquire because I a have a Client
    that would like to use their old typographic standards on their new signage system.
    The font is spec'd out as Helvetica Medium in their graphic standards. And now
    they are looking online to find and purchase Helvetica Medium and I need to make
    an argument that Helvetica Medium and Helvetica Roman are the same.\r\n\r\nAny
    advice would be great, thanks."

  body: "It's not surprising that there is some confusion over what weight \"Helvetica
    Medium\" is because, historically, there were differences in the names of the
    weights between Linotype and Haas Foundry.\r\n\r\nHaas Name -- Linotype Name\r\nHelvetica
    Light -- Helvetica Light\r\nHelvetica Regular -- Helvetica\r\nHelvetica Medium
    -- Helvetica Bold\r\nHelvetica Bold -- Helvetica Black\r\n\r\n<em>Source: The
    Type House (Minneapolis) Helvetica specimen booklet, c. 1975, which displays versions
    of Helvetica available for Linotype (hot metal), Foundry (hand-set metal), Linofilm
    (phototypesetter), and Typositor (VGC film headline setter).</em>\r\n\r\nLinotype
    Helvetica Bold was a bit bolder than Haas Helvetica Medium because it was designed
    for smaller size ranges (6pt to 14pt and 14pt to 72pt, respectively, are shown
    in the booklet I have). For circumstantial reasons, the Linotype names are the
    ones that have predominated in the digital type era."

  body: "There is a difference between Helvetica Medium and Helvetica Regular.  Helvetica
    Medium is actually a semibold face that achieved fame in the Modernist era where
    it was used as a display face over and over.  The regular weight is actually more
    of the text weight. Helvetica Medium was frequently specified for signage across
    the globe. The very early personal computers, sometimes would deliver Helvetica
    Medium\" which was named by them as \"Bold\".  Part of this was a screen resolution
    issue since true bold would not resolve well on screen in the 80's.  To get the
    \"True\" weights of Helvetica, go to the Linotype site and see the originals.\r\n\r\nI
    take that back about the Linotype set.  They have since rearranged their naming
    system.  What was popularly known as Helvetica Medium when dozens of 20th Century
    design Standards were written  is seen by looking at the work of Rudy DeHarack
    M\xFCeller-Brockmann, and certainly, Massimo Vignelli. Also see Paul Shaw's book
    on the New York Subway signage.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/026201548X\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Helvetica-Medium_5788.png]\r\n\r\nHere

  body: Swiss 721 is more or less the same as the Linotype version. The only version
    I know of that is close to the old foundry Helvetica Medium (and Typositor version)
    is URW's Nimbus Sans D Bold (the "D" is for "display"--it's the display cut that
    Linotype never had).

    after customer complaints, they used redrawn versions.
