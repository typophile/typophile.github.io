  body: It looks like hand lettering. Notice how the Rs vary. I can&#39;t think of
    any existing fonts which would be similar offhand. That kind of A and K are very
    unusual.

  body: Boy did that lettering artist have a hard time with R&#39;s and A&#39;s. I
    bet he/she had to do it in no time flat.

  body: Part of the charm of hand lettering sometimes is that it doesn&#39;t look
    perfect. Also, I think the Rs were drawn differently to fix spacing problems.
    This is a common practice with hand lettering and something you can&#39;t easily
    do with type.

  body: Its very fun looking and I love that its hand drawn. It makes it more personal,
    just the kind of feeling for that movie.
