  5.0\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bug-1_4339.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bug-2_5720.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhen
  clicking the blue box under the character in the preview window it doesn't show
  'key glyph in class' or 'referenced in class' as it should.\r\n\r\nOh well - back
  to 5.0 again.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody else have this problem?"

  body: To be honest I have never understood what that function was all about since
    it have always been inactive like you show it, so yes I guess I have this problem
    too.

    Adam's link is broken and my search on the Fontlab site turned up empty.

  body: "Adam means the following:\r\n\r\n---\r\nQ: I am having problems with the
    user interface of FontLab Studio 5 for Mac OS X. Some icons are missing or mislabeled,
    or some windows do not appear\r\nA: You can manually reset the user interface
    and the settings of FontLab Studio 5 for Mac OS X. For that, please quit FontLab
    Studio and then remove the files:\r\n~/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio
    5/Workspaces/CurrentWorkspace.rc\r\n~/Library/Preferences/com.fontlab.fontlab5.plist\r\nAfter
    that, launch FontLab Studio and enter your serial number. Note: ~ stands for your
    user folder, e.g. /Users/JohnDoe/\r\n---\r\nOne correction: you won't be asked
    for your s/n but only your name.\r\nIt is also good to trash the CurrentWorkspace.rc
    file after updating or downgrading FLS. ;)"
