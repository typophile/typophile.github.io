  body: "I'd have to say as these are taken from the nameplates of old US cars, they
    were never fonts to begin with.  If someone has digitized them since, you may
    find them, but I've got quite a few script fonts myself and couldn't find anything
    close enough.\r\n\r\nHowever, the closest I can find to New Yorker is Bounce Script
    from Letterhead fonts or Mrs. Blackfort (Sudtipos) and Ed Script by House Industries.\r\n\r\nbuena
    suerte!\r\n\r\nJH"
