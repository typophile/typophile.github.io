  but he&#39;s been very <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/16400.html"
  target="_blank">good</a> to <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16451.html"
  target="_blank">me</a> personally as well. <BR>As an homage, I thought I would reveal
  his little-known alter ego:  <BR>&#34;Little Red Riding Hood&#34;. A strange and
  powerful superhero who  <BR>travels the globe stamping out dull typography by instituting
  crazy  <BR>word-splitting line breaks. The Great Hood lives on mushrooms. <BR> <BR><img

  <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll see that Jared never truly loses his earthly persona - the <BR>Typophile
  shirt is exposed beneath his superhero garb.'

    hell of a guy. Thanks for Typophile! I wish you  <BR><b>a very happy birthday</b>,
    enjoy! <BR>I was going to design you a little Birthday PDF like  <BR>I did for
    Chesh but my sister&#39;s friend is giving birth  <BR><i>right now</i> &#40;two
    weeks early&#41; so I have to get busy  <BR>with the birth announcements. Maybe
    later.

    was shot just moments before both Stephen and Jared were up to their frozen elbows
    digging through bins of old metal type. <BR> <BR>Stephen&#39;s looking serious
    only because he&#39;s trying desperately to stay warm. He left his hat on the
    bus.

    imagine the &#34;Pink Ketchup Boys&#34; to be from Germany. Have to be from Austria
    &#40;At least I hope so for all the German stand owners&#41;. <BR>But the stand&#39;s
    design is very, ahh..., nice. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik
