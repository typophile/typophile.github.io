  to use the following fonts in her books:\r\n\r\nSnell Roundhand\r\nLinoscript\r\nDemian\r\nCult\r\n\r\nNone
  of the PostScript versions of these fonts have the special Turkish characters, and
  my search for OpenType versions that have Turkish support have not been successful.
  Can anyone recommend good lookalikes that are known to support Turkish?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/turkish_5897.png]"
