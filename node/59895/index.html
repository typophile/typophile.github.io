  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I just joined Typophile, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to keeping up with my account!! I&rsquo;ll begin by mentioning a calligraphy-based lettering artist named Luca Barcellona. I stumbled upon his outstanding style via [[welovetypography.com]] - what a lovely little designers' distraction! The lettering styles featured in Luca&rsquo;s Flickr-based portfolio ([[http://tinyurl.com/csvkdq]]) have all found themselves in my research archive, while I struggle to practice a variety of methods on a daily basis.</p>

I know it probably sounds typical, but I feel a bit more than obligated to devote a certain amount of my time to Ooo-ing and Aww-ing  over type. Type of all kinds. Lettering of all kinds. I just relocated from Baltimore to Chicago, and while I unpacked all of my books I found myself surrounded, sitting on the floor, flipping through all the books that I&rsquo;ve neglected over the past few months.</p>
<p>95% of them focus on graphic design; old and new. 90% of them discuss typography. 80% of them were purchased online. 20% of them are annual publications. 10% of them were designed by Abbott Miller. Another 10% of them were edited by, or contributed to by Ellen Lupton. 5% of them are autographed. 3% of them are still contained in shrink wrap. 1% of them are never stacked upon and are contained in a plastic freezer bag, because I don&rsquo;t even trust myself around the Pentagram Bible. There is also a shelf-full that focus more on photography (but that&rsquo;s another story).</p>
<p>Writing is always something I thought I would have more time for, and maybe Typophile will be a nice outlet for that. Looking forward to my next post!
