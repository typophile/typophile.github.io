		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think that this depends on the language. German might have actual rule forbiding it running text, I think. Many old Italian books used it all the time, every &ldquo;and&rdquo; instance; &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; is also written &ldquo;&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think that in English, it could safely be used in headlines and other display applications, and in proper business names, i.e., &ldquo;We decided to take our case to the firm of Reynolds &amp; Reynolds Attorneys, instead of the cheap storefront team around the corner.&rdquo; Otherwise, I would leave it out of <em>text</em>.</p>
<p>Also, I belive that common practice is to remove spaces when initals are used, e.g., &ldquo;Research &amp; Development, Inc.&rdquo; but &ldquo;R&amp;D, Inc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Discussion is a two-way street. In what context do you need an ampersand answer. Are you trying to accumulate some sort of general understanding, or do you have something specific that you are looking for?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dan, sorry for the late reply, I had no idea this question would be so popular and it seems Typophile doesn&rsquo;t email me anymore when people reply. My curiosity was sparked by a recent logo I designed that used a somewhat prominent ampersand. This led me to question its proper use, and this led me to Typophile.</p>
<p>So far, I think I&rsquo;m going to have to go with the Chicago Manual of Style on this one. I agree that the ampersand tends to stand out too much and so becomes distracting, as Eben&rsquo;s post illustrates well (no offense).</p>
<p>Thanks for the great discussion everyone. You&rsquo;ve even managed to spark an interest in another topic: the use of small-caps. But that&rsquo;s for another post.</p>

And it looks so chic in the Cyrillic context. Some ad agencies just love it. Incidentally, the Russian for ‘and’ is the <strong>i</strong> (yes, that ‘inverted N’, U+0418 and U+0438), and the meaning of the ampersand (&amp; = <em>et</em>) is completely lost on the Russians.

It would be great to see in Russian or in Spanish fanciful versions of &lsquo;i&rsquo; or &lsquo;y&rsquo; used in place of the ampersand, or do they do this already?

<p>A lot of the time, we seem to use it for identifying the difference between fonts! My favourite type references always include the numerals and the ampersand, because often it&rsquo;s one of the more distinctive characters in a typeface.</p>
<p>As a young &lsquo;un I was taught the Chicago Manual of Style version, that setting ampersands is only acceptable in company names and common abbreviations. Later on this also came to include (of rare necessity) copyfitting headlines and titles where no other alternative was available.</p>

<p>I had read a very convincing article that made the point that &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; saves space, &amp; that really, like anything cultural the decision to use &lsquo;and&rsquo; not &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; is just a matter of habit or dogma - or put another way - it&rsquo;s use or lack of it is what what people are used to at the time.</p>
<p>The article further argued that culture changes &amp; that really people could be used to using &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;and&rsquo; if we decided that that was what we wanted. Still more, there were aesthetic &amp; economic benefits! I bought that idea.</p>
<p>I like &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;. I like to see it. I like all the variatons in form it offers. The character is one of the most doted on by type designers &amp; is sometimes - often - the most beautiful glyph in a font as a result.</p>
<p>So my view of &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; is nuanced. I want to see it more but I know it isn&rsquo;t widely accepted as a substitude for &lsquo;and&rsquo;. I am in the minority &amp; I know it.</p>
<p>I also know that my opinion is just culture and could change - again. Still, I think in English we just have a body of english majors who have bought the dogma that &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; should not be used in body text &amp; parrot that idea without looking or thinking or feeling anthing much about it. They are just stupidly rigid. Goddam Chicago manual. Fpppht.</p>
<p>BTW - I like &lsquo;&amp;c&rsquo; too.</p>

<p>a) Use an en dash buffered by two spaces on either side – like that. The alternative—em dash—is huge and distracting.</p>
<p>b) Use small caps instead of regular capitals so as to not call too much attention to them. People in the US and in the former USSR can both agree. It allows the reader to flow along the line.</p>
<p>c) The argument that it saves space could also be applied to the percent symbol, as the origin of it came from truncating the fraction 1/100. I would argue that a big fraction is more distraction than the percent symbol and would opt for it 99% of the time.</p>

Interestingly, when a poem is set in a sans serif font, further simplifying the &amp; to a +, a prospect that seems vaguely blasphemous, serves that purpose even more.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, I&rsquo;d agree that probably in Cummings&rsquo;s poetry, and certainly in that of the even more concrete poets that followed him, most typographic choices were likely made with a very conscious <strong>eye</strong> towards the look of the printed poem. However, a lot of poetry is also written with a conscious <strong>ear</strong> towards the sound of the poem recited. And, although this may very well be veering towards an entirely different conversation, I think that typography, especially in the context of poetry, &lsquo;and&rsquo; vs &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; vs &lsquo;+&rsquo; for example, can affect, even if only minutely, the way something is read aloud.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the ampersand is underused (although frankly not by much). Some people (often amateur designers) use it too much, frivolously; but some people want to outlaw its use based on some strange linguistic purism, or worse still, based on Modernism, e.g. &ldquo;as few distractions as possible&rdquo;. Information is not a distraction; information is useful. So if you use the ampersand in a way that helps convey more information (like through disambiguation), that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Examples from my own writing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most obvious way that Latinization affects a non-Latin script is in the imposition of &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; formal elements such as certain serif structures, stroke contrast &amp; stress, modularity, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Letters made to look like animals or nuts &amp; bolts are not uncommon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of its high level of modularity and reliance on the basic line &amp; circle, Futura presents us with much more uniform –therefore ambiguous– word shapes than Gill Sans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the argument for saving space doesn&rsquo;t seem very sensical to me, except in rare cases where the ampersand can avoid an ungainly linebreak (while not being too intrusive itself).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">For me, and this is completely unscientific, when &lsquo;and&rsquo; is spelled out and used in extensive repetition, it begins to feel heavy, to the point where, if I was reading aloud, I would begin to pause before each occurrence, treating the conjunction as an implied comma. The ampersand on the other hand, being a single character, provides a continuous flow between the linked words or phrases. This is possibly a construct entirely of my own—logic would imply that the ampersand, as punctuation would be the more likely to cause one to pause slightly, and not the other way around.</div>

<p>For example, screenplay by &ldquo;Elba Matzoff and Chris Sobrino &amp; Pat Roberts&rdquo; means that Chris and Pat actually worked together on a version of the screenplay, whereas Elba did a treatment or rewrite on her own.</p>

Both because it is distinction with a definite meaning as used by this guild,  And because it shows how arbitrary a choice it is -  It might have been the other way around. An &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; seems to draw two names closer ( to me at least ) not the other way around. Still, once the choice is made, it&rsquo;s done for a while - it&rsquo;s culture. Until culture changes.</p>
<p>When re-reading this I stared thinking about quotes &amp; started imagining how you could have a similar sort of thread about which is better</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>french quotes <strong> &lt; quote &gt; </strong> 
( poor attempt at this for m of quote I know )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or english ones<strong> &ldquo;quote&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One culture goes one way the other another. They certainly &lsquo;feel&rsquo; different, but is one better? Im not sure one is. I think The &lsquo;&amp; - and&rsquo; debate is the same way.</p>
<p>Talking about reading and pauses, I agree an &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; is probably going to make most folks pause a little more just because they see it less often. Sort of like if you set a section of text or a word in some font unfamiliar to the reader.</p>
<p>Of course once the reader gets used to it - then it&rsquo;s different thing.</p>

<p>My intuition tells me that - no - it can&rsquo;t - really it&rsquo;s all utterly relative to what your used to &amp; the fact that these examples feel good &amp; right to me has to do with some shared typographic cultural soup I happen to be in rather than some sort of noncultural aspect of type like maybe this bouma shape we hear so much about.</p>
<p>Then again maybe I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To me it seems to be a balance of the undeniable jarring effect of the &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; glyph versus its -also undeniable- semantic usefulness in adding structural information to a sentence. The big question is, how fast can a person get used to seeing it in text? Like how far into Gill&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essay&rdquo; does the typical reader (not at all the same as the typical type designer) stop noticing the glyph and just absorb the content?</p>
<p>Lacking strong insight into Familiarity (a pervasive issue in type design), hyperconservative people will totally shun the ampersand (since it constitutes a deviation from the status quo), while iconoclasts will overdose on it. The people in the middle are -as always- in the most difficult position, since they actually feel compelled to think about it, to try it out and objectively gauge the effects on the ground.</p>

When an ampersand can save me (and the reader) from an overly-ponderous sentence, or when it unifies things that are really one concept (e.g. &ldquo;line &amp; circle&rdquo; above), I use it. Come to think of it, it&rsquo;s sort of like using parantheses in a math equation to explain what gets multiplied before/after being added, etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So you are saying that to you the &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; tightens the connection. I agree. Hollywood writing standards apparently don&rsquo;t - but I don&rsquo;t care. The fact that the space is decreased is enough for me to have it feel closer. I guess the counter arguement might be that &lsquo;and&rsquo; is natural and common whereas the &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; is exotic - by current use anyway. But I don&rsquo;t feel that way.</p>
<p>The important idea behind all the non-iconoclastic suggestions I have seen here is that the &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; can somehow suggest a different kind of sense of &lsquo;&amp;/and&rsquo;. A different flavor or intesity of &lsquo;&amp;/and&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You &amp; Dan are also suggesting that an &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; after a long string of text helps the flow of reading. So maybe there is some sort of linguistic or visual rule that could be invented. For instance: if the sentance you have is over &lsquo;x&rsquo; number of words/charcters long and no ascenders or descenders come within &lsquo;x&rsquo; number of characters then an ampersad is preferable to &lsquo;and&rsquo; because it aids in reading - or something better thought out - but do you see where I am going? The use could be described. But it would be complicated. Still, I like this direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ampersand usage varies from language to language. In English and French text, the ampersand may be substituted for the words and and et, and both versions may be used in the same text. The German rule is to use the ampersand within formal or corporate titles made up of two separate names; according to present German composition rules, the ampersand may not be used in running text. In any language, the ampersand&rsquo;s calligraphic qualities make it a compelling design element that can add visual appeal and personality to any page.&rdquo; - Max Caflisch</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In the book Finer Points in the Spacing &amp; Arrangement of Type there is a good argument for the use of the ampersand in text, based on traditional practices. But it is more a British tradition.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when Hartley &amp; Marks reprinted the book, and added a new preface, they used ampersands ad nauseum and their setting was awful as a result because they ignored the rationale for the use of the ampersand. It allows for tighter word spacing (which they ignored). And there are usage rules (where they should be placed or not placed, how many to use in a line, etc.). In the context of British typesetting (mid-century) the use of the ampersand is not an aesthetic decision in and of itself, but a technical one, as it facilitates a better looking page.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Peter, I&rsquo;ve always avoided the ampersand, in spite of my affection for its appearance, except in titling where a bond was being implied between two proper nouns or between two things spoken of as a unit. I like the ampersand, but I find it jarring outside of certain contexts. It&rsquo;s faster, more eye-catching, and more space-efficient, which makes it good for headlines, and particularly in ads.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always associated ampersands with advertising/commerce for those reasons, particularly when they&rsquo;re over-used. In fact, I read a book where ampersands were intentionally inserted into the copy when the author wanted to emphasize something he was speaking about and give it a crass, commercialized edge (a sort of sarcastic marker, in a way, that references advertising copy). It would read something like this:</p>
<p>He was walking down the street in his blazer &amp; loafers, showing us all how he had wealth &amp; power now. But it was obvious he had just come into some cash and had no real class whatsoever.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember who did it, though. David Foster Wallace, maybe?</p>

<p>Some ampersands are so pretty it seems a shame to sentence them (no pun intended) to the mired pit of correct usage.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve always been of the opinion that if you feel strongly about something, then play the tune. If enough people start marching, playing, or singing along with it you are a trend-setter, and not merely a rule-breaker.</p>

<p>I had a discussion about this a week ago and based on my gut feeling removed a lot of ampersands from the body text of a resume, leaving some in headings, company names etc.</p>
<p>For me it is an aesthetic decision and I feel that ampersands in running texts are distracting and inappropriate.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I arrived at this thread because I&rsquo;m handsetting a colophon in lead type, Caslon Italic No. 540, and as I was counting the sorts to see if I had enough, the ampersands got my attention. They&rsquo;re very flamboyant and begged to be used. There are only two occurrences of &ldquo;and&rdquo; in the colophon, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was right to use ampersands in what actually was a paragraph of running text.</p>
<p>I looked in Geoffrey Dowding&rsquo;s <em>Finer Points in the Spacing &amp; Arrangement of Type</em> and was happy to find an entire section on the use of the ampersand (pages 23 through 29 of the paperback edition). He begins the discussion by saying that, in hand composition, &ldquo;The judicious use of the short ‘and’ invariably improves the appearance and readability of a setting&rdquo; by providing an additional option in word spacing. But what rang truer to me were some thoughts he passed on from George D. Painter of the British Museum&rsquo;s Department of Printed Books: &ldquo;[the ampersand] is or can be a beautiful object in its own right, and was dwelt upon more lovingly by scribes and type-designers than any other sort except Qu, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should say. I decided to use the ampersands in the colophon but not in the main text, which is a poem and doesn&rsquo;t need word spacing to justify lines, and which will be set in Caslon Oldstyle No. 471, whose ampersands are stodgy by comparison. Now I just have to decide whether to use one in the title, which I would like to set in some sort of casual script. It would fall at the beginning of the second of two lines. Mr. Puckett above says that &ldquo;starting a line with an ampersand would be quite dreadful,&rdquo; but Dowding says, &ldquo;It should be remembered that while the (&amp;) looks quite happy at the beginning of a line it may not do so at the extreme end of a line&hellip;&rdquo;. I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to see it before forming an opinion.</p>

<p>For example, consider the sentence:</p>
<p><em>Some classic railroads of the past included the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe; the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford; the Delaware &amp; Hudson, and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific.</em></p>

Is using an ampersand from a serifed face in a sans-serif headline considered bad tone?
I&rsquo;m trying to establish the limitations to Bringhursts &lsquo;use the best available ampersand&rsquo; rule.
I&rsquo;ve got a sub heading set in National book smallcaps, and am having a tough time finding a suitable, aesthetically interesting ampersand to go with it. Thanks.</div>

<p>In the meantime, it can enhance the faux effect provided by applications.
For a subhead in a regular weight sans, it&rsquo;s not too bad.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>But if Peter is still considering inserting a serif ampersand in a sans setting, I would say not unless there is a bit of a &ldquo;wordmark&rdquo; treatment; otherwise, in a straight setting, the mere use of the ampersand character provides enough interest.</p>
<p>The meme which combines ornate ampersand with block sans is used primarily for titles, and acronyms.

Funny logic. To me stroking type because it&rsquo;s too light seems about as «discerning» as squooshing type because it doesn&rsquo;t fit in the designated space.</div>

<p>Note that I advocate stroking for faking small caps primarily for regular sans serif fonts.</p>
<p>BTW, when faking small caps, it may be useful to increase horizontal scaling and tracking as well.</p>
<p>I stress that this process is for discerning typographers, because it requires subtle massage and a good eye.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>These transformations (adding weight, adjusting scaling and spacing) are the same ones used by type designers when we make small caps &ndash; although we have more subtle tools (allowing different additions of weight to the x and y axis) and also add further manual tweaking. I would imagine that the vast majority of true small caps are created by type designers by thus modifying upper case glyphs. At least, that&rsquo;s the way I always work, and I can&rsquo;t imagine why one would make them from scratch, rather than modifying upper case glyphs.</p>

Nick, I have. I guess we have different thresholds of acceptability. FWIW, I do use tracking differences of a few 1/1000s when it&rsquo;s really unavoidable (as it sometimes just is); but I don&rsquo;t subscribe to distorting type.</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;I stress that this process is for discerning typographers&rdquo;</cite>
And I stress that discerning typographers know when not to fake something. At least in my book, <em>no</em> small caps are clearly better than fake small caps* (and yes also better than stroked fake small caps).</p>
<p>(* Except <em>maybe</em> on the web, where the generally coarse resolution may make the difference less perceptible.)</p>

<p>OK, then please identify which of these are real, and which faux:
(Screen grab from InDesign file.)
<img src="/images/old-images/scaps_5130.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Admittedly, I copied true small caps, then applied stroke, tracking and horizontal scaling to match.
But if one doesn&rsquo;t have true small caps to copy, then one really does have to be discerning to create a good faux small caps effect in InDesign. 
To follow on Hrant&rsquo;s comment, it&rsquo;s a bit like type design.</p>

<p>The usage of ampersand is very rare in Turkey, why? No idea :) On the other hand you can see especially in sports posters in the meaning of versus.</p>
<p>@ As in Tom &amp; Jerry?</p>
<p>Yes sir, we can consider as it is. I do not mean that ampersand means &ldquo;versus&rdquo; in Turkish; it has also a lateral meaning to be careful of use.</p>
<p>Tom&amp;Jerry means &ldquo;Tom and Jerry&rdquo; and also it can be understood like versus.</p>
