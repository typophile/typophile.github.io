  body: "There something wrong with that? Consider doctors handwriting, and a personal
    favourite (I'm english). Lost my thread, because I put the point outside the brackets,
    unlike our American cousins.\r\nA personal favourite is signatures which are actually
    \"Joseph smith, his mark\". As in scribble. I used to be a dispatch rider, and
    a readable signature was something required to be radioed back to the office.
    I cannot count the times I asked someone to put their name to a piece of paper,
    to get squiggle. Yeah well, who signed for it? Squiggle. Did you get a printed
    signature? Yeah. Who was it? Squiggle. Boy did sign a lot of paper."

    By the way, the font comes with Microsoft Office 2011 for the Mac.'

  body: "No offence to Mormons. Hhraff, hurr..\r\nGermans have words for things like
    taking pleasure of others misfortunes. Perhaps, considering it is a good, agglutinative
    language, they will concoct a word for \"one who has driven mitt romneys campaign
    with enormous amounts of superpac money to see him fail dismally unless they invent
    a new chads scam\".\r\nBut I wouldn't put money on it."
