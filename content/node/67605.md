  of text? (like in example, I mean the smallest text). Does it strongly affects legibility
  in longer texts?\r\nThanks for any answer."

  body: I think studies have found that flush left works best, because the eye knows
    the proper point to return to at the end of a line. But this is in comparison
    to ragged left and centered. I suspect that in the case of those slanted, but
    otherwise consistent columns, there shouldn't be a significant difference (for
    that reason).

    Another picture would be great.

  body: "The case made for flush left (aka ragged right, if I am not mistaken) is
    twofold:\r\n1. A consistent beginning of each line, which aids continuation after
    the end of a line\r\n2. Identical wordspaces, which facilitates reading by consistency
    (the eye [brain] knows when the next word starts and how much to \u2018jump\u2019
    to the next word)\r\n\r\nIn your example both points can not be satisfied, hence
    these are less legible than flush left."

  body: "@ bert: Can you cite studies which support these points? Conventional wisdom
    dictates this, but there is little empirical data to back it up.\r\n\r\n@ jarsson:
    try looking at\r\n\r\nStiff, P. (1996). The end of the line: a survey of unjustified
    typography. <em>Information Design Journal, 8(2)</em>, 125\u2013152.\r\n\r\nMiles
    Tinker did a <strong>lot</strong> of work around the 1950's on type and reading,
    but he was more interested in speed and eye movements than comprehension. His
    studies, while not perfect, are quite easy to read and a great starting point."
