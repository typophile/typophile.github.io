body: "Would love it if someone could identify this serif font, I've been looking
  for it for ages. \r\n\r\nI'd describe it as a modern, stylish serif font, with thin
  geometric serifs, used in a lot of youth culture and hipster contexts. I've included
  a photo of it from the Australian counter-culture surf magazine, STAB. Sorry it's
  a photograph so it might be slightly warped but you'll get the idea.\r\n\r\nAny
  similar fonts would be appreciated too.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
