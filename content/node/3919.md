  an admirer of all of your designs for some time, and have been doing my level best
  to be a self-taught type designer. &#40;Uh-oh... :D &#41; <BR> <BR>I have quite
  a few fonts in the works. This is the first one I have publicly shown, although
  I have been using my own fonts in my freelance designing for years. <BR> <BR>While
  Architrave is my own design, it was largely inspired by &#40;and could be described
  as a transporter accident between&#41; Clarendon and Jenson. <BR> <BR>I would welcome
  any comments, as well as suggestions on how to go about marketing and licensing
  some of my fonts. <BR> <BR>Thanks for making such a forum as this possible. <BR>

    I want to ask why who put a hybrid stroke terminal on ur lc b and q? Also the
    serif terminals that you used on your uc and lc &#40;Cc&#41;have differents positions
    which break the visual armonity and unity betten letters. <BR>Congratulations

  body: ' Ricardo: Thank you for your encouragement and comments. <BR> <BR>Regarding
    the lc &#34;b&#34; and &#34;q&#34;, are you referring to the serifs themselves,
    or the spurs? The serifs were taken from the Clarendon model, and the spurs were
    elements I liked and exaggerated from the Jenson model. <BR> <BR>As for the mismatched
    terminals on the uc &#34;C&#34; and lc &#34;c&#34;, that was a personal preference
    call.  In the lc &#34;c&#34;, the obliquely-positioned terminal serif seemed to
    work, to my eye, something like the Clarendon upright serif in the uc &#34;C&#34;
    and the ball terminal of the lc &#34;c&#34;. I also didn&#39;t want the font to
    look TOO uniform, so I incorporated little quirks wherever I thought it would
    work without upsetting the entire font. &#40;Other examples of this include the
    spur on the lc &#34;e&#34; &#91;also borrowed from Jenson, without the slope&#93;,
    the unorthodox lc &#34;x&#34; and the foot serifs on the uc &#34;V&#34; and &#34;W&#34;,
    as well as much of the numeral sets.&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be very interested
    to hear more thoughts on this as well. Do the quirks work together, or have I
    disrupted the balance of the font? <BR> <BR>Thanks very much for the input. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Here is a sample text setting. <BR> <BR>As I was checking the kerning,
    I noticed that the uc &#34;F&#34; was in fact NOT behaving. I made a couple of
    changes, adding a bar serif to the uc &#34;F&#34; &#40;and hence, to the uc &#34;E&#34;&#41;

    numerals: I myself prefer to give them vertical stress &#40;like in some of Gill&#39;s
    work&#41; instead of the traditional horizontal. So as much as I like that zero
    I rarely use it, and have been looking for something nice&#42; with vertical stress
    that is still distinguishable from the letter &#34;o&#34;. Last month I found
    it: look at the one in Berthold Wittingham. <BR> <BR>&#42; The traditional old-style
    solution of making the zero a thin circle with no stroke contrast I find horrid.
    And I think it was made that drastic because back then the &#42;compositor&#42;
    had to be able to easily distinguish it when sorting a type case. We no longer
    have this issue, so there&#39;s no real need to make it so ugly. <BR> <BR>BTW,

    <BR> <BR>Thanks, Marc, and apologies for this much-delayed response. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    made a few more adjustments to Architrave roman, including airing out the lc &#34;g&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also been working on an italic companion face to go along with
    the roman and the sans, as shown here. It&#39;s still very much in the early stages,
    with lower case only so far, but I&#39;m excited for the direction it&#39;s taking.
    Here&#39;s a sample. <BR> <BR>As always, comments are very much appreciated.

  body: ' Joe: <BR> <BR>To be completely honest, I&#39;ve hate a sort of love-hate
    relationship with the shapes of these characters as well &#40;lc &#34;f&#34;,
    &#34;j&#34;, &#34;t&#34;, &#34;y&#34; and, to a lesser extent, the tail of the
    lc &#34;a&#34;&#41;, and for the very reason you mentioned. My opinion pendulum
    swings back and forth from &#34;novel, quirky and interesting&#34; to &#34;odd,
    unfamiliar shape that seems wrong&#34; and back again. <BR> <BR>I decided to take
    the risk of showing them as is, trusting that unfamiliar might just be unfamiliar
    and not necessarily bad. I&#39;m actually surprised that you&#39;re the FIRST
    person to mention it on the forum -- I really thought more would have before now.
    &#40;One of my friends offline mentioned it as well, with the same reservation
    against passing final judgement until I got more of a body of feedback.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>I tried a few alternate forms, such as a &#34;buttonhook&#34; curve &#40;which
    ended up being used instead as the lc &#34;f&#34; and &#34;j&#34; and the smooth-curved
    &#34;t&#34; in Tinhorn, showing elsewhere on the Serif Forum&#41;. I also tried
    forms based more closely on Clarendon and Jenson, but neither of these seemed
    quite right for this font either. The final curve shape could be described as
    roughly similar to Clarendon&#39;s ball-terminal lc &#34;j&#34; with the ball
    knocked off, or a bent-and-thickened Jenson lc &#34;j&#34; &#40;at least, as revived
    in the Centaur &amp; Hightower forms&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, now that it has been mentioned,
    does anyone else have an opinion on these forms? Are they &#34;novel, quirky and
    interesting&#34; or &#34;odd, unfamiliar shapes that seem wrong&#34;? Or something
    else? <BR> <BR>===== <BR> <BR>Sbo: <BR> <BR>Of course, the only glyphs that I
    have completed for the italic set are the dark black ones on the Architrave Italic
    display. The greyed glyphs are merely sloped romans, and will be replaced as the
    italic characters are completed. The italics are being designed generally narrower
    than the romans, sloped to an average of 12 degrees right of vertical, and as
    cursive in stroke form as is feasible.  <BR> <BR>Regarding the lc &#34;g&#34;,
    do you think that only the italic form should lose the &#34;ponytail&#34; ear,
    or are you suggesting losing it in the roman and sans forms also? I considered
    both a horizontal ear and also an abbreviated curve ear for the italic &#34;g&#34;,
    but I kind of like the distinctiveness of the exaggerated ear form as designed.
    <BR> <BR>As for the italic lc &#34;g&#34;&#39;s tail, I modeled it after many
    versions of the triangular-shaped loop of the Jenson italic form &#40;compare
    Centaur Italic &#91;Arrighi&#93;, Bembo Italic &#91;also based on Arrighi&#93;,
    Hightower Italic, and Adobe Jenson Italic, among others&#41;. Architrave is a
    rather heavy typeface in weight, and I know that it does tend to clog in greyscale
    JPEG images onscreen. It doesn&#39;t seem to have that problem when printed or
    in vector-based applications. Getting the font&#39;s hinting done may help solve
    the problem. Still, I&#39;ll look at ways to air out the loop. Some time in the
    future, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get around to doing a lighter weight for book and
    long text applications. <BR> <BR>I have to agree with you somewhat on the italic
    lc &#34;x&#34;, and &#34;y&#34; -- they are the greenest and most unruly of the
    forms I posted so far, as they are only a first draft. I do want them to be distinctive
    and playful, but these currently look like they might throw a disk at any time.
    &#40;Watch me get sued for negligence by my own font....&#41; <BR> <BR>The lc
    &#34;z&#34;, however, looks pretty good to my eye, except for some obvious need
    for careful kerning and hinting. The swash tail was a deliberate design decision.
    What specifically would you suggest for these characters &#40;x, y, z&#41;? They&#39;re
    only a couple of days old, so I know that my eyes are still not seeing them completely
    objectively...  <BR> <BR>The forms for the &#34;0&#34; &#40;zero&#41; were also
    a deliberate stylistic decision, as I have always liked the &#34;sideways stress&#34;
    forms. They serve not only to distinguish the &#34;0&#34; &#40;zero&#41; from
    the uc &#34;O&#34;, but also to provide visual distinction from the &#34;6&#34;
    and &#34;9&#34; figures. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll adapt the form somewhat for the
    italics, but don&#39;t expect a narrower uc &#34;O&#34;, at least not in this
    font. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still working on the italic ligatures, as I naturally want
    to finalize the component characters first. <BR> <BR>===== <BR> <BR>Thanks for
    the comments, all! I hope I&#39;ll hear more. I&#39;ll post again as the fonts
    develop. <BR> <BR>David '
