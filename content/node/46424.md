  body: "I think these letters are not the most distinctive to make an ID from, but
    the short center arm on the E is found in the [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100013|H&FJ
    Knockout]] family, which has many variations of weight and width. No. 68 seems
    fairly close to your sample, I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
