  long last, this book is available on pre-order at Amazon and Barnes and Noble at
  a sweet discount until it is actually in the bookstores.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Engraver-Monograms-Stationery/dp/1616890673\r\n\r\nIn
  this age of emails, texts, and instant messages, receiving a letter has become a
  rare treat. Engraved stationery can make a piece of correspondence, whether a short
  note, formal letter, or business card, even more special. Once an integral part
  of social life, the use of engraved stationery has become a lost art. In The Complete
  Engraver, author Nancy Sharon Collins brings this venerable craft to life-from the
  history and etiquette of engraved social stationery in America to its revival and
  promise of new visual possibilities. Illustrated with gorgeous, original specimens
  of social stationery, calling cards, and monograms, The Complete Engraver also includes
  an instructional section that walks the reader through the engraving process and
  the steps required to commission engraving work today."
