  body: Some sort of OCR I'd think. Not likely a commercial font exactly, since special
    equipment is required.

  body: There are a "free" font called Halter by Apostrophic Lab out there that may
    do the trick. Otherwise if you just want the look and feel of the credit card
    characters I think you'll like Ray Larabie's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/kredit/">Kredit</a>...
