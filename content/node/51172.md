    buried under some amazing wonderfulness mixed with excessive stupidity of late,
    which isn't ready for relating in public quite yet.\r\n\r\nThanks y'all for the
    good thoughts, and yes, Paul, I can't think of a better way to spend one's birthday
    than in Paris....\r\n\r\nMili: I'll be real happy if my Canadiens improve their
    power play, y'know?"

    had almost the next best thing three weeks before my birthday -- I got to chaperone
    Geoffroy de Pennart, a charming gentleman from Paris (who spoke almost no English,
    but writes and illustrates the most amazing childrens books) around Calgary as
    part of our literary festival. My French definitely got a serious workout!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
