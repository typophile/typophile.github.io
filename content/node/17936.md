body: I am taking a class at University in which I must create a font through font
  blending and tweeking it myself.  I will not have a Mac for the remainder of the
  semester, so I am creating my font on Fontographer 4.1 for PC.  While I have been
  able to blend my fonts no problem, I am in search of a tutorial or effective instructions
  should they exist somewhere with regards to all the point and paths?  I've looked
  everywhere!  If anyone could lead me in the right direction it would be much appreciated.  Thank
  you!!!
