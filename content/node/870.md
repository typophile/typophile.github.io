  better here. Can you figure out what it is? But besides that, I&#39;m really wondering
  what you think of it. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/1396.gif"

  body: ' OK, I guess you guys give up. <BR> <BR>So, you know how typophiles cringe
    when they see a monoline sans condensed to fit a measure and as a result acquire
    a highly uncomfortable horizontal stress &#40;because the vertical stems become
    too thin&#41;? Well, I was thinking, what about the other way around? With some
    horizontal expansion you would quickly make a monoline sans acquire contrast,
    and &#42;that&#42; would actually be usable. <BR> <BR>So what you&#39;re seeing
    is Futura Condensed, 150% wider! A nice surpise, huh? It seems to work out fine,
    even in the diagonals. Basically, a completely new style of letter in 2 seconds.
    The only real problem is characters with &#40;necessarily&#41; unconventional
    stress, like that clunky &#34;s&#34;. But still. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Matthew Carter did some investigations into scale-proof lettering around
    1970, essentially trying to see if it was possible to shore up a design against
    horizontal scaling. &#40;I seem to recall that &#34;Video&#34; might have figured
    into the name of the design, but that doesn&#39;t sound quite right.&#41; If I
    recall, Matthew &#40;and Linotype&#41; decided to scuttle the project, but there
    were some interesting proofs published in the Journal of Typographic Research.
    Squarish thing with a bit of contrast, somewhere on the Melior-Eurostile-Folio
    continent. '

  body: ' &#62; Squarish thing <BR> <BR>Interesting. And it implies that the intent
    was to combat distortions from horizontal compression, which is of course the
    most common way users torture type: gotta save that space! &#40;Which makes me
    realize: maybe they should try using vertical compression for a change, at least
    when it&#39;s not a gotta-fit-it-on-this-one-line deal; especially since vertical
    savings always matters, whereas horizontal savings can come to naught when you
    hit a paragraph break, which is very common in a newspaper - a consideration Tracy
    has pointed out&#41;. <BR> <BR>So I guess the features of a font that help preserve
    its integrity/character when compressed are: <BR>1. Good stroke contrast. <BR>2.

    the first image is pretty revealing. The narrowest style &#40;#6&#41; looks usable
    even at 200% I think. And at 150% the lightest weight &#40;#1&#41; sort of validates
    my original suspicion: Olive seems to become a nice monoweight sans. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    I hadn&#39;t realized that in the darkest weights Olive&#39;s lc &#34;s&#34; goes
