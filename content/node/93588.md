  what this typeface is? Here's the website where it is used:\r\nhttp://www.atipo.es/\r\nBeautiful,
  balanced, a nice combination of different styles. Thanks :D"

    should ask them directly.\r\n\r\nIf you use the Edit link to move the post up
    to the main Type ID Board, maybe someone could be able to inspect the flash file
    in order to get a name."

  body: I know they are a design studio but I couldn't find this font on their site,
    which led me to believe that they used another foundry's typeface for their main
    identity. I actually still can't find this font so I wonder if they sell it at
    all. Thanks anyway.

  body: "Their opening page is a flash file. It is possible to interpret a flash file
    (.swf) to determine its components. In this case, it includes the font, embedded.
    \ \r\n\r\nThe rest of the site seems to indicate that they use this font and a
    lighter version for all of their client design work. Doesn't make sense to me,
    but that's how I read it!\r\n\r\nDo move this to the Type ID Board as suggested
    by Riccardo. You  originally posted in the 'solved ID' section. Not your fault,
    the site layout is very confusing! But  only you can move the thread to where
    it belongs, because you originated it.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "From http://tundrablog.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture-52.png, one can conclude
    that Atipo sans exists (at least) in light, regular and bold\r\n\r\nIf you download
    http://issuu.com/corondel/docs/elcorondel_52#download (in Spanish) and have a
    look you will find in an article concerning their font Calendas (on page 22) the
    following sentence:\r\n<blockquote>\r\ndise\xF1aron la familia Atipo sans para
    su propio estudio aplicada en logotipo, papeler\xEDa, web, etc\xE9tera.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nIt
    thus seems rather clear that Atipo sans is  for their own use only.\r\n"
