  them one alternative using a particular font called Agenda (see sample below). As
  I haven't got it and they aren't sure they want to use it anyway I wondered if there
  might be a free shareware alternative which might be similar just to get by until
  they decide what they prefer.\r\n\r\nAnyone know of anything as I've looked and
  found a few but think the curles on some of the letters (such as L's) are quite
  extreme.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nA[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Agenda_6280.jpg]"

  body: That will be tricky, as Agenda is a descendant of Johnston and Gill Sans and
    a relative of Bliss, none of which are free. You might consider P22's Johnston,
    which is not expensive, but note that it doesn't have the variety of weights available
    in Agenda.

    mentioned, is in the same genre. \r\n\r\nEDIT: I could be completely wrong about
    Gill Sans coming with Windows; it might be part of the Adobe Creative Suite."

    Tell the client that it's a low resolution preview. If they approve, you can purchase

  body: "Perhaps Mark Simonson, who has single weights of Changeling and Coquette
    included the collection, will chime in. Perhaps he hopes to drive sales of other
    weights, in seemingly the same way the as designers who contribute fonts to the
    Indie Fonts books?* Or perhaps Ascender pays something approaching a regular royalty
    and uses the package as a loss leader?\r\n\r\n\r\n*Although this makes more sense
    in the case of Indie Fonts, since those books are aimed primarily at an audience
    of designers who are more likely to purchase fonts than the hobbyist crowd to
    whom Ascender is presumably marketing."

  body: 'Never understood this kind of marketing nonsense. And how are the designers/foundries
    then supposed to convince potential buyers to pay a regular price for their other
    fonts? The only message they send out is: "Fonts aren''t worth much", so it creates
    a negative spiral. The same goes for bundling full families of high quality fonts
    with Adobe software. What''s wrong with including just a couple of weights to
    entice potential buyers?'

    What? I'm not sure what's unclear about FontShop sublicensing Font Bureau fonts,
    as they have done with little or no confusion since 1989. I could understand if
    they charged differently than us, or offered a different set or a subset of styles
    but niether of those situations exist. And \"the FontFont range of typefaces\"
    is what?\r\n\r\nYves, 'm not sure what your gripe is either. Where exactly is
    the marketing nonsense of which you speak?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "David - I've been following the business side of type for a little while
    and I have the impression -- I could very well be completely wrong -- that the
    way certain typefaces are bundled and discounted make them look \"cheap\". I often
    have had discussions with end users, trying to convince them that digital type
    is a product of intrinsic value. Basically it's really hard to make them see type
    licenses should be paid for, not just exchanged amongst friends and colleagues.\r\n\r\nWhen
    four weights of Today Sans are lumped in with some other fonts and then sold for
    $19.95, it tends to get difficult to explain why a single weight should retail
    for $39.50. And even more so when InDesign CS comes with a.o. complete high quality
    OpenType families like Adobe Caslon Pro, Adobe Garamond Pro, Adobe Jenson Pro
    and Adobe Warnock Pro. Make no mistake, I'm happy to have those with my software,
    but I suspect this might make the lives of independent font foundries a little
    harder."

  body: "I agree with you, Yves, but I also see something else. I'll try to explain.
    I'm going to generalize and so might step on some toes. I'm not trying to insult
    anyone, I promise.\r\n\r\nPeople who license type are not one sort of people.
    There are many shades of gray. Some people do have an eye for good type but would
    never, ever, pay $39.50 for a font. No matter what. But they would pay $19.95
    for a quickie bundle. \r\n\r\nThen there are those who wouldn't buy an inexpensive
    font bundle because they'd wonder if there were hidden strings attached. \r\n\r\nThen
    there are those who are in the middle somewhere. They know fonts are tools and
    need them for their toolbox. They can't always afford the most expensive and so
    bundles such as this might ingratiate them to a foundry because they were able
    to use some of their fonts for less money.\r\n\r\nI could see using bundling,
    from a foundries point of view, as a way to get the lower end of the spectrum
    to consider using more of their fonts. \r\n\r\nYes, in some ways it makes one
    wonder about the worth of a typeface. But the truth of the matter is that it is
    a success just to have someone licensing the font instead of downloading it. \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    this is clear as mud."

  body: "Stephen, thanks for the clarification...Yves you do more than follow, I 've
    been chasing some of your ideas for years. but...\"When four weights of Today
    Sans are lumped in with some other fonts and then sold for $19.95...explain why
    a single weight should retail for $39.50\"\r\n\r\nBecause, they don't have a license
    for it, that's why.\r\n\r\nExplaining to someone that fonts must be bundled should
    not be too hard: no user of any supported language of the OS should have to go
    out and buy fonts to enable use of the OS and its bundled apps. \r\n\r\nThe fewer
    and fewer applications that come separate from the OS, must come with enough fonts
    so that any user wishing to make any kind of document you've Ever seen before
    will not have to go out and buy more fonts. \r\n\r\nThen there are bundles that
    are not associated with OS or Application, and those are targeted at users of
    other products and or services where people need to make documents like you've
    Never see before.\r\n\r\nThen, and in order to go on, the definition of independent
    font foundries needs to be estabilshed as what? \u2014 those foundries who do
    not involve their fonts in bundling? \r\n\r\nI think perhaps you hear people who
    have an IP-IQ problem?\r\n\r\nHere is a good test: PCs of all kinds from the Huskiest
    Desktop to the Invisiible Nosephone come bundled with music. Do all users find
    themselves content with the bundled music? What are their choices in aftermarket
    bundled music? Does any of this have anything to do with the indy musicman (relative
    to digital technologies effects)?\r\n\r\nIf people think intellectual property
    is not worth 39.95, but want to use it anyways, then they are breaking the law.
    It's not that some fonts are free or cheaper that make them do it is it? \r\n\r\nTiffany
    says, \"People who license type are not one sort of people\" which I heartily
    agree with, and I think it goes without saying that \"People who don't license
    type, are one sort of people.\" :)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
