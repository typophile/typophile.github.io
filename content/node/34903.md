body: "Hello. I am planning to embed bitmaps in one of our fonts to improve on screen
  appearance in very small sizes. However I am wondering how TTF fonts with embedded
  bitmaps behave now in Windows XP and Windows Vista. Does it depend on the Settings
  of Windows whether or not the applications honour the embedded bitmap table of the
  TTF font? \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have experience in which circumstances the bitmaps
  will show in the specific ppem sizes, and when the Windows rasterizer show the rasterized
  outlined instead?  How can one make sure the bitmaps are used, when the outlines
  are present in the font as well? \r\n\r\nThanks, Peter"

    note as they've some experience here. Also you could experiment with Calibri and
    Cambria (shipping versions) as they contain embedded bitmaps at key sizes - these
    were inserted to improve rendering when CT and regular antialaising were turned
    off, or under certain terminal server settings. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

    I'm not sure about how the OS settings affect the selection of the bitmaps - I
    can test on XP if you like (or I can send you Arasan for you to test yourself).
    I'm also not sure about how Unicode and/or OT fonts play into this. Are you doing

  body: "My experiences show that embedded bitmaps work in Windows only when ClearType
    is OFF. If it is on, the embedded bitmaps are not shown. This is, of course, something
    we could expect because ClearType does not use full pixels but instead does subpixel
    rendering. Especially with subpixel (fractional) glyph positioning (where the
    origins of the glyphs are also positioned on subpixels, showing embedded bitmaps
    would be very odd). \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, \r\n\r\nit's not the point. The point is that when ClearType renders
    fonts on fractional widths, then the glyph origin may fall on the R, the G or
    the B subpixel. So then, assuming (in a simplified way) that the left stem of
    a glyph will be only two subpixels thick, it will be then rendered on the RG,
    GB or BR subpixels. In other words, the same character in one line of text may
    be rendered differently if it occurs several times. \r\n\r\nThere is no way that
    this can be done with bitmape, even if they have fixed colors. In theory, for
    a bitmap-only font, ClearType could be smart and render such font on integer widths
    only -- but the problem arises if, say, only 1/4 of the glyphs have bitmaps. This
    is a case the rasterizer would have to consider -- but mixing embedded bitmaps
    on integer widths and outline glyphs on fractional glyphs would be difficult to
    implement and I doubt it would yield any good results. \r\n\r\nThe recent incarnations
    of ClearType do show great potential. The rendering is quite good and more legible
    than the Windows 2000/XP grayscaling (but then, the Windows 2000/XP grayscaling
    is horrible -- Mac OS X shows that pure grayscaling can still yield good results).
    \r\n\r\nHowever, I feel that the implementation of ClearType has gone in the wrong
    way when it comes to how a font can opt in or out to certain treatment. Microsoft
    should have extended the gasp table in a clear, readable way so that a font could
    choose what and when to use: embedded bitmaps, delta hinting, grayscaling, subpixel
    glyph rendering, fractional/integer widths. The ClearType rasterizer could still
    apply its defaults to fonts that don't have any of it specified, but for newer
    fonts for which the developer specifically tuned some settings, there should be
    a clear way to tell ClearType: \"Here, I want pure black-and-white delta-hinted
    outlines for this one\" or \"I want embedded bitmaps\". \r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
