  away from most members on this forum. <BR>For my typography exam I have to make
  a book that has different chapters regarding typography, like history, design, construction
  of the letter, etc... The book has to be based only on one letter of the alphabet.  <BR>I
  chose the letter &#34;A&#34;. One of the sections is about showing the letter in
  every day stuff. For example: a ring could be the letter &#34;o&#34;, or a pair
  of scissors open could represent the letter &#34;x&#34;. <BR>I&#39;m having trouble
  finding the letter A, either big or small &#40;A, a&#41; in every day stuff, so
  any suggestion is greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>thank you. <BR>Jo.'
