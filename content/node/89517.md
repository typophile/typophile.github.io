body: A few months back I came across a book about non-graphic-design typographical
  usage (in architecture, jewelry, interior design, and more). I think the title had
  typo/type/typography in it but I'm not sure. Does anyone know of such a book?

  body: "Justin - it wasn't \"just my type\" but it does look interesting, despite
    the criticism in the thread attached. \"Signs...\" might help too, although it's
    too \"graphic\". Thanks for these wonderful suggestions!\r\n\r\nWilliam - Great
    book about architecture, thanks! and an interesting thread about art - a wonderful
    book dealing with type in art is Simon Morley's \"Writing on the Wall: Word and
    Image in Modern Art\"\r\n\r\nAluminum - What interests me is the use of a graphic
    element, with a past and a personality, within a different realm of design, such
    as jewelry, interior design, architecture etc."
