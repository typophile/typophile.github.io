body: "Hello all. Trying to find an existing typeface as similar as possible. If it
  was a custom type design when created in 1935, it was at least a little expanded
  at some point, evident by its use in the Kodachrome logotype. I found some that
  are similar, but it'd be great if anyone knew of something closer (check out that
  very characteristic \"a\").\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kodachrome_type_4063.png]"

    the serifs are in the right places, except for bottom rhs on _h_ and _m_. General
    match for all letters, including the terminal on _r_.\r\nMinor adjustments in
    weight and width and tinker with some details, such as the bowl on _a_, for an
    even closer match.\r\nDon\r\n"
