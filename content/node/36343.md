body: "I'm working on a website for a client that wants to offer various media options
  with articles in the way newspaper websites often do.\r\n\r\nIs there a single font
  that offers these options as a coherent set:\r\n- smaller and larger text size options\r\n-
  email option (typically an envelope icon)\r\n- print option (typically a wee printer
  icon)\r\n- video camera icon\r\n- audio (typically a little speaker with waves)\r\n\r\n(If
  not, somebody should. I suspect people are nicking these from each other all over
  the web.)"
