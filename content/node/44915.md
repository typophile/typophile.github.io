  body: The only digital Elephany I'm aware of is the Carter & Cone/Microsoft copyrighted
    version that MS <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FID=94&FNAME=Elephant&FVER=1.51"
    target="_blank">bundled with a group of products</a> years ago.

  body: OK. So Elephant (later renamed Big Figgins) came bundled with some <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FID=94&FNAME=Elephant&FVER=1.51">Microsoft
    products</a> until about 2003. Seems to have vanished since then.
