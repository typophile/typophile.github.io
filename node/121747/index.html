		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi, thanks for replying JamesM.
The issue is that I had a slight mistake, try to correct it, but the &ldquo;EDIT&rdquo; button does not aparce on my panel.</p>
<p>Ok. so try to say is this:</p>
<p>-ONE-
Does anyone know of any web site to generate precise combination color?
(the point is that I would like it to be the web the most professional possible)
eg KULER, but a better place.</p>
<p>-TWO-
Does anyone know any technique to generate a colors professionals or colors clean?
ie I&rsquo;ve noticed that colors have a code either RGB or CYMK, but choose a random color in the spectrum I find something wrong,
Is there a mathematical technique to obtain a professional tone color?</p>
<p>Example in photoshop:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Code chosen color palette by default PS</p>
<h1 id="9e9e9e-grey">9e9e9e (Grey)</h1>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code chosen randomly</p>
<h1 id="9f9898-grey">9f9898 (Grey)</h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You may notice that the first code has a order logic, while the second code is messy.
It is what I call &quot;&quot; color professional &ldquo;and&rdquo; color dirty &quot;</p>
<p>I hope you can help me, Thanks!</p>

<p>No one sees the code, they see the color. I tried both colors you mentioned in Photoshop and they looked fine (but slightly different).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>There are books, color wheels, and websites that offer advice if you need it, but it boils down to picking colors that look nice together. Keep in mind that color is subjective — there are some general principals for picking colors but different people have different preferences.</p>
<p>Also you need to choose colors that fit the subject. A children&rsquo;s publication might have bright colors, a serious medical publication might have very muted colors. And so forth.</p>
<p>What are you trying to create? A website? A printed piece?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Plax, as James alluded, there&rsquo;s no such thing as professional colors. All colors are good; they just need to be used appropriately to get professional results.</p>
<p>The color spaces you mentioned, RGB (red, green &amp; blue) and CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow &amp; black), are common color spaces.</p>
<p>With RGB, red, green and blue light is combined to create colors. One hundred percent of each color creates white. Zero percent of each color creates black or the absence of any light. Varying combinations of percentages of red, green and blue light create a full spectrum of colors. Your computer monitor, smartphone screen and television set all use RGB.</p>
<p>CMYK, on the other hand, is what&rsquo;s used in 4-color process printing. Varying the percentages of cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink (black is represented by the letter k),  creates all the various colors that CMYK is capable of making. The percentages of these colors are determined by the size of the small dots of ink printed on the paper. CMYK colors are typically specified in percentages. For example, 80% cyan, 100% magenta, 100% yellow, 18% black will produce a dark red. These percentages might commonly be written out as 80,100,100,18.</p>
<p>RGB percentages require a bit more explanation. RGB is typically specified in hexidecimal, which uses sixteen base numbers instead of the usual ten (decimal) that most people are familiar with. In other words, there are six additional base numbers in hexidecimal, so counting goes like this: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f. The letters represent the additional numbers. The reasons for using a hexidecimal system instead of the more familiar decimal system has to do with the way that computers do calculations, which is a whole other subject. Since working with RGB is primarily done on a computer, it makes sense to specify RGB values in computer terms.</p>
<p>With that explanation out of the way, RGB colors are specified pretty much like CMYK colors are specified, except that it uses the hexidemical system. So that same dark red that I mentioned above, in which I used CMYK percentages, now roughly becomes 9b (red), 1f (green), 17 (blue), or as it&rsquo;s commonly written out, 9b1f17.</p>
<p>The RGB color you mentioned in your post was 9e9e9e. The numbers form a consistent pattern only because equal amounts of red, green and blue were specified, which produces a neutral grey. Changing the values just a bit to, say, 9f9898 simply shifts the balance between RGB to produce an ever-so-slightly reddish gray. Similarly a very bright red would be produced by ff0000, which basically says spells out pure red, with no green or blue. Pure green would be specified as 00ff00. Different combinations of those hexidecimal values will produce pretty much all the different colors of the rainbow. None are more or less professional than the others — they&rsquo;re all just colors.</p>

The color &ldquo;CADRE&rdquo; does not exist, just try saying &ldquo;PROFESSIONAL&rdquo;
Thank you for your explanation as complete.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m a little confused, do not know how to explain what I need,</p>
<ol>
<li>I agree with what you comment and your answer is correct,
but I think there&rsquo;s something more, that I can see something more than just colors.
maybe you have right when he says that &ldquo;need to be suitably used for professional        <br>
results&rdquo; I agree with that.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps I can best explain with the word &ldquo;COLORS FINE / COLORS WITH CLASS&rdquo;
What happens when it comes to &ldquo;One color&rdquo; here there is no combination,
therefore the selection of a single color is very important, continue with the example of you red color.
Is there a technique to define a color fine red?</p>
<p>You mention that depends on the occasion, speaking of a logo &hellip;
red for creche is very bright,
while a red for a restaurant is a darker red
That is absolutely clear.</p>
<p>but both the bright and the dark will have two paths to your choice,
low class  and one with class, two for each.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the closest I can explain.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>As Thylacine mentioned, there&rsquo;s no such thing as &ldquo;professional colors&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for &ldquo;classy&rdquo; colors, then generally you want subtle colors (not bright or vivid), but it really depends on the situation. You might try looking at the websites or catalogs of companies that have the kind of style you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We seem to be having language barrier problems, so we might not be answering the question you are asking.</p>
<p>You mentioned colors that are &ldquo;fine&rdquo; and &ldquo;with class.&rdquo; Those are subjective words or words without precise definitions. When choosing colors, a designer often picks colors that have emotional qualities that speak to the viewer. For example, bright red is a loud, exciting and aggressive color. A dark red still speaks aggressively, but has a softer, relaxed and more comfortable feeling to it. Similarly, blues and greens are calming and cool.</p>
<p>There is no manual or formula for choosing the right colors for the occasion. Choosing colors and color schemes is often a matter of intuition and judgment. Sometimes colors are already chosen for a designer and must match already-existing company color schemes.</p>
<p>As James mentioned in his first post, in the U.S., the Pantone matching system is used most often to specify exact colors. Printed books are available that list all the Pantone colors, along with color swatches of each. Picking which one to use, however, is still a matter of intuition and judgment. Pantone does not tell you which color to pick; it simply lists all that are available in their system.</p>
<p>Most designers also use the Adobe suite of graphics software. Adobe InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator all have similar color choosing features that show the colors and give the values in both CMYK and RGB. This suite of software also contains already-made color swatches that match most of the most popular color matching systems in the printing industry, including Pantone.</p>

<p>You can see how even the top 2 logos have red and blue different, even so these combine &ldquo;PERFECTLY&rdquo; with other colors within its tones of your logo.</p>
