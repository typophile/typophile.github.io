  title=\"Ignite 5\">an Ignite presentation</a> this Thursday (2011.02.10) in Toronto
  on the topic of vertical and RTL text.  It\u2019s actually about how the assumptions
  of the inventors of the original personal computers \u2013 Americans in Northern
  California \u2013 have made it difficult to typeset real-world writing. And just
  forget about having computers run OCR on text that flows in any direction other
  than left to right and top to bottom.\r\n\r\nThe presentation\u2019s title \u2013
  \u201CWhy Can\u2019t Computers Read the Goof Sign?\u201D \u2013\_will be explained
  on site.\r\n\r\nIgnite presentations, incidentally, use 20 slides that auto-advance
  every 15 seconds without human intervention. You\u2019ve <em>really</em> got to
  be organized.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s at the Drake Hotel, Toronto. Doors open at 1900;
  show starts at 2000. <a href=\"http://visualthesis.com/igniteto/ignite-toronto-5-during-global-ignite-week/\"
