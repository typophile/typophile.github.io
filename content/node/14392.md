  www.lancome.com - and in every department store cosmetics counter - and attached.\r\n
  \r\nElegant, balanced, fine contrast. Are there any other faces that share the same
  stylistic cues? \r\n\r\nThanks and regards, \r\nDavid Perkins "

    that've been around for a while --  are hand lettered/custom designed.\r\n\r\nAs
    for typefaces that share the same stylistic cues: do you mean high contrast with
    small, sharp serifs?"

  body: "That style is called Elzevir. It started around the middle of the 19th century
    in France (as a reaction to Didone typography), and was taken up around the turn
    of the century by US foundries, where it was sometimes called De Vinne. There
    are some digital versions of the American stuff, but the original French stuff
    is harder to find. Our J P Knox has been working one on though:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/7596\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
