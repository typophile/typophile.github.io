    I guess having a look to some tags at MyFonts would give you more better suggestions:
    ''[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Aornamental|Ornamental]]'', ''[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Aornaments|Ornaments]]'',
    ''[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Aflourish|Flourish]]'', ''[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Afloral|Floral]]'',
