  for many foundries to create these characters. Is this because they just don\u2019t
  want to support Irish, or because \u201Coccasionally used in Irish\u2026\u201D means
  that they\u2019re only going to see use in the footnotes of books by Morgan Llewellyn

  body: "There are two orthographies for writing Irish. The older orthography uses
    the dot accent to indicate lenited (weakened) consonants, in the newer orthography
    an <em>h</em> is used after the consonant to indicate lenition so the dot is not
    needed. This means that there is a standard way to write modern Irish that does
    not require dots, so they are not strictly necessary. However, both orthographies
    have official status in Ireland -- the constitution, for example, has an official
    text in both orthographies -- and for reproducing older documents the dotted consonants
    are needed.\r\n\r\n"
