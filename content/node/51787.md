  things:\r\n\r\nDisplay Slab Serif -- bold\r\n\r\nRecently designed -- I think the
  original designer died and it was finished up by someone else. \r\n\r\nIt was mentioned
  in Creative Review and there was a photo of the guys desk and all the letters were
  hanging above it on individual pages.\r\n\r\nI've seen it in a lot of fashiony/designy
  pieces lately."

  body: "No you were right!\r\nI must have misread the died part. I always thought
    it had been started by someone and than finished by someone else. I'll have to
    re=read that Creative review thing.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
