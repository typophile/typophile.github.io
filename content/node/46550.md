    its not clear send us a pointer and we'll take a look. \r\n\r\nWhat's almost certain
    is that the client will need a separate license for the font. \r\n\r\nCheers,

  body: "Here's something I've always wondered, is it possible to transfer a font
    license to a client once you are done using it? For example, you purchase a typeface,
    and create the work, then supply it to your client along with the font license,
    and the delete the original from your machine.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "A search will identify threads on font license transfers but the scenario
    you describe seems a bit self defeating. \r\n\r\nA few weeks/months/years down
    the line when the client needs some more tweaks, do you ask them to stop using
    it and transfer the license back to you? \r\n"
