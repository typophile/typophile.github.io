  body: "Nice! I found this style online as a free font about 12 years ago, and chose
    it for my Costume Goddess business. I re-designed the \"T\" though (below) 'cause
    it looked more like a \"C\". \r\n\r\nI just bought this new one and what a pleasure
    to use! Now I have a complete character set. I can especially see the difference
    when I outline it. Very smooth, about 10 times fewer anchor points. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/book#3cover_72_6625.jpg]"

    materials, but at that time I knew nothing about fonts or how to acquire them.
    I had just purchased my first computer. '

    and opportunity. \r\n...Or just indulgence. Being in the midst of a recession,
    spending a lot of time on a rather esoteric style of limited use is probably the
    last thing we should be doing. But sometimes you just have to do things.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
