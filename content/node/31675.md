  body: It was put out by Phil's Photo - which is today <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/"
    target="_blank">Phil's Fonts</a>. It's not the same as their font catalog and
    I think it's been out of print for years. <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&y=0&tn=homage+to+the+alphabet&x=0"
    target="_blank">Used copies</a> always seem to be available, though.
