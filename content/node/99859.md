  body: "Wow -- you all are truly incredible -- thank you defiantone, Josef, gargoyle,
    and Uli so much for your help -- \r\n\r\nI am a total novice, and I have a couple
    of follow up questions --\r\n\r\n1) Uli, when you say that the pdf has the font
    files, does that mean that I can extract the font from the pdf and use it? I imagine
    so, but I didn't know that was possible, so I just wanted to check.\r\n\r\n2)
    Would there be legal issues with me extracting the font and using it for a commercial
    product? I imagine so.\r\n\r\n3) Is there any way for someone like myself to buy
    the license for a font such as this one that isn't currently put being sold through
    regular channels?\r\n\r\nThanks again all for your help."

    that there's no license for it and that it was made into digital format for preservation,
    you can use the link also provided to download the files & use them. no?\r\n\r\n\"In
    1992, a year before the bankruptcy in 1993, had the H. Berthold AG, the original
    1950s metal type or hand-set version of the Palatino, which was sold in the 1960s
    as Diatype font disc and Diatronic font support yet quickly converted into PostScript
    Type 1 fonts. This Berthold Palatino 1992 (= Palatino 1950) in the PDF file Pala92.pdf
    (7 pages, 280 KB) is documented, which can also be downloaded as zipped PostScript
    printer file Pala92ps.zip (1.5 MB)\"\r\n\r\nedit: provided of course, that you
    have the software and ability to use the .ps file that is there"

    legal? no idea. "

  body: "Extracting the fonts might or might not be illegal and/or unethical. But
    <em>redistributing</em> the fonts might very well be both. For one thing, I think
    Linotype (so now Monotype) still owns the rights. So I think you <em>could</em>
    get in trouble, especially in Europe. And not getting in trouble doesn't necessarily
    make it OK...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    or legal gray areas -- I just want to be able to use the font!\r\n\r\nAnd thank
    you defiantone for all your terrific help -- I tried out Palazzo -- the individual
    letters all look very similar (though, to me, the w's are a bit different) --
    but I just tried printing out a page of it and the overall impact seems very different
    from the original Palatino.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, the book that I got the
    text from was printed fairly recently -- it was printed in 1997 -- I wonder how
    they got the font!"
