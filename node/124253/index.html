<p>There may be some call for the option of a &ldquo;barred I&rdquo; for uses that want total monospacing, or for the isolated word &ldquo;I&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The stroke weight across the bottom of the ampersand is unusually shallow.</p>
<p>I might suggest differentiating the zero as a closed loop with an isolated stroke in the middle. And close the loops in the percent too, because really, what are you even hoping to do there.</p>
<p>Cyrillic П is not likely to be recognized at all. You&rsquo;re better off inverting a U for that.</p>
<p>Greek is begging for a lowercase omega. Also consider the advantages of a lowercase lambda.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi! Thank you for your time and your helpful advice. I utilized most of it as seen here:<img src="/images/old-images/Bez%C2%A0tytu%C5%82u_5470.png" alt="">
I was actually thinking at times about the barred I, but I didn&rsquo;t get to it before. I know this one is a little creepy, but it&rsquo;s the only way I could think of.
I&rsquo;m a little unsure about the &lsquo;lowercase&rsquo; omega and lambda. I like them on their own (esp. the omega) but since I don&rsquo;t know Greek I have no idea how they would work among other &lsquo;not-so-lowercasey&rsquo; characters. I can only hope they&rsquo;d do just like their Latin equivalents. One thing that could be done is further case diversification.
I&rsquo;m rather reluctant about the П though. Do you find the Greek pi unrecognizable as well? Whenever a glyph needed an extra stroke to fill in the whites, I seeked inspiration in handwriting, despite the somewhat technical/industrial appearance of the face. I thought it worked well for these two. I&rsquo;m aware I might be alone in this belief, but wouldn&rsquo;t basing the П on an inverted U make it too easily confused with the capital lambda?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Handwriting, glad you mentioned it. Cyrillic cursive and italic forms have a number of interesting peculiarities, and among them is that &ldquo;п&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;n&rdquo;. So I meant to flip your &ldquo;u&rdquo; as it is, and the resulting &ldquo;n&rdquo; with the stem preserved may be the clearest possible solution. What you had was really an &ldquo;л&rdquo; with a swash, which is not unheard of. You may get a number of other useful ideas by studying Cyrillic handwriting, and also a thing called vyaz, which is a historic kind of decorative space-filling blackletter.</p>
<p>As for the Greek &ldquo;π&rdquo;, it is decipherable, but consider squaring off the top, and perhaps even mirroring it entirely.</p>
