  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have been lucky to be able to get Doyald Young&rsquo;s two larger tomes &ldquo;Logos and Fonts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Logotypes and Letterforms&rdquo; from my Library. Hooray for Interlibrary loan! I have enjoyed reading about his fights with spacing issues such as when a logo includes an All Cap &ldquo;LA&rdquo; Combination. He sensibly shortens the lower bar of the L. He also explains that it was for even color that he loses the pot hook on top of the &ldquo;i&rdquo; in a script &ldquo;riu&rdquo; combination. And he extends the lower bar of a &ldquo;z&rdquo; with a swash to fill the void of a &ldquo;v&rdquo; in &ldquo;rendezvous&rdquo;. These adjustments are all in logos meant to catch the eye, although each of these adds some optical evenness to the designs as well. I think these books might be instructive for Opentype display type makers with a mind to make contextual alternates, or maybe with some special care - Opentype text face makers as well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have read only &ldquo;Fonts and Logos,&rdquo; which I also own. It&rsquo;s one of the books I&rsquo;ve learned most from about type.</p>
<p>As to adjusting letter pairs in text type: It is a good idea, but the problem for a font, as opposed to a logo, is that there is no end to it. So it is hard to know where to start and stop, beyond using open type to rectify &lsquo;f&rsquo; problems, such as has been discussed recently in another thread.</p>
<p>The lesson I took away from Young for text type is the importance of getting the letter forms themselves right, so that they color well in context of all&ndash;well almost all!&ndash;the other letters.</p>

<p>Depending on the font chosen that might be okay&hellip; But I am guessing Doyald would make an AA ligature.</p>
<p>Bill, you are I think, spot on where Doyald&rsquo;s sense is as far as fonts and special cases. But then there was no Open type when he wrote these books. It&rsquo;s time to question the tradition. Maybe it will hold up. Maybe it won&rsquo;t. But Doyald insights do ( I think ) show us some opportunities for where we might begin that questioning process.</p>
<p>Also, based on my own experiments so far, the list of combinations that we might consider seriously isn&rsquo;t infinite. It&rsquo;s somewhat daunting, but by no means undoable. And it offers yet another chance to increase quality by letting the eye settle things. Supposing that I could show you a list of say 16 situations and offer a compelling justification for making a contextual alternative for each one. Would you consider implementing it? If this were the case, it would be a smaller job than doing even a single optical size. No?</p>

<p>My take is pretty narrow as reported. I am reading the books with a specific purpose - which wasn&rsquo;t (I am nearly sure) his in writing them.</p>
<p>But outside of my own purpose I am also curious to hear what everybody thinks in general. I had heard some big praise so I had to check them out. I will also admit that while I think his stuff is amazingly strong, the aesthetic he works in isn&rsquo;t my favorite. It&rsquo;s very interesting seeing these styles being done well. I think his stuff was imitated poorly for years.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Some fonts don&rsquo;t even require f ligatures, so I think I think that the benefit of contextual alternatives would depend on the style of the font. In general, I think lower case to lower case should require relatively little kerning, if the letters are well designed. Also I favor a style with slightly looser letter spacing than in many fonts, so again that reduces the likely benefit of contextual alternatives in the lower case.</p>
<p>For other cases, where it will make a difference, I&rsquo;m yet to be convinced that it will make a big enough difference in text to undertake the initiative and put in the work, aside from the &lsquo;f&rsquo; issues. But I&rsquo;m willing to be persuaded by examples you or others may post.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, you are right that wider spacing begins to obviate the need or value of a contextual alternative. I will not be posting the list just yet. But I will show you them in Buffalo I hope. I am not sure I will convince you or anyone. But I will make the best case I have then. I was asking a theoretical question in order to sound out the limits of your potential interest.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not yet Eben. Doyald wrote me (himself, very kind!) that they will be mailed priority either on the 4th or on the 7th morning. Unfortunately I just had a bad experience with stuff being sent priority from the USA. I ordered <cite>Masters of the Italic Letter</cite> by Kathryn A. Atkins from AbeBooks. The ordered was handled by a book shop in New York, but despite ordering it with priority shipping on the 9th of October I only got it last week. The combination of the holiday season and the crappy Italian postage system got in the way, I guess. So I fear it might take a while before I can actually get Doyald Young’s books.</div>
