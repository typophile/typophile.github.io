  body: i can read it, but not too clearly.  the H could be a double T... <BR>and
    the RK is a little hard to read. <BR>overall, i think it looks &#39;off&#39; because
    it slants further and further down, till it about falls off my screen.  it starts
    out straight, and then just degrades.

  body: 'I read, &#34;Pit ttFortz&#34;. My confusion is caused by the following: <BR>
    <BR>1 The &#34;c&#34; curling up, rather than down makes it seem like a swashy
    arm to the &#34;tt&#34;. <BR> <BR>2 Because of the LC/UC type, the &#34;H&#34;
    reads as &#34;tt&#34;, or because of its positioning it reads as an UC &#34;H&#34;
    starting another word. <BR> <BR>3 The &#34;r-k&#34; reads as &#34;rtz&#34;, especially
    as the positioning relates to the dropping &#34;tt&#34; in Pitch. <BR> <BR>I imagine
    the rightbound degradation of the letters that Loren referred to can be dealt
    with if there are any graphics to be associated with the type. <BR> <BR>PS: Thanks
    for the assistance on my So Cal Waves logo.'

  body: 'Thanks for the input!  <BR> <BR>Loren: Yeah, I guess I&#39;ll try aligning
    the PITCH on one baseline, and the FORK on the other. That H really is in limbo.
    I&#39;ll simplify it too. <BR> <BR>Scott: No problem, I hope I have been helpful
    to you. Your input is certainly helpful. The RTZ I will have to rework. I&#39;ll
    post again soon. <BR> <BR>Thanks guys. <BR> <BR>Andrew '

  body: It looks a little like PitchFerk, and Im somewhat distracted by the Capital
    H . I love the k though.
