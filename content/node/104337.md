  sample from 1922 (book cover for Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West - looks like
  gold leaf or perhaps embroidery?)\r\n\r\nIt is a Trajan-style, however Trajan itself
  doesn't match the serifs, which are almost half-serifs. Once I have a typeface that's
  pretty darned close, I can make modifications like the swashes etc.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any assistance you can provide!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/200px-Decline_of_the_West_1922_5722.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02082013-DSCF0758_5366.JPG]"

  body: "Great book full of deep and somber thoughts.\r\nThe cover is an excellent
    example of German Antiqua lettering with micro serifs in early 20th century style.
    I clipped and pasted some of the letters that are repeated. Note the subtle differences
    in proportions [ignore the clipped swash tail on the last R]:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UntergangCompareLetters_6582.jpg]\r\nI
    looked at German fonts from the era but have not yet found one that is particularly
    close. You might have to do a pastiche of several fonts.\r\nDon"

  body: "Here is another font that gives some further ideas on how an Untergang full
    font might work. It was designed few years later by F.H.E. Schneidler and released
    in 1936 with the name \"Schneidler-Mediaeval mit Initialen.\" It is usually called
    Schneidler Initials.  I recommend the version by Castle Type, released as  <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango/\">Sh\xE0ng\xF3</a>. Good
    selection of alternates. The monoline version <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango-gothic/\">Sh\xE0ng\xF3
    Gothic</a> is also useful.\r\nDon "

  body: "Thank you so much, Don - all good insights! I came across Shango in my searches,
    but after a certain point, it all blurs together! I hadn't thought about the specific
    German history of the type, other than classical-revival generally, so thanks
    for these ideas. \r\n\r\nI'm trying to re-draw the lettering/reproduce the cover
    type, but was looking for the best starting point, and perhaps this is it."

  body: "You're welcome. It seems to me that the lettering for Untergang may have
    been intended to have an effect that was monumental & architectural to suggest
    the importance of the subject and Spengler's very structured approach to it --
    thus the use of Trajan as an inspiration, in a very similar way that important
    buildings were graced with neo-Trajanesque inscriptions -- plus a contemporary
    feel that suggested a measured and scientific approach to the subject. Best wishes
    for your redesign. Shango with a touch of Ehmke & Weiss should do the trick.\r\nDon"
