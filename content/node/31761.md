body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt appears that some Typophile forum & wiki headings are rendered
  as plain text, with the aid of a flash script (masthead.swf / block_title.swf).
  Because of this script, the font displayed on screen is not dependent on the client's
  system.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have more info on this, or a similar flash script which
  renders web fonts in this manner?\r\n\r\nI've searched high and low without much
  success :/\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Hi noftus,\r\n\r\nI have been using the sIFR script on numerous occasions
    with success. Version 3.0 is currently in beta but still very stable to use. You
    can <a href=\"http://novemberborn.net/sifr3/r209\">read about / download it here</a>.
    Alternatively, if you prefer using a stable release, you can <a href=\"http://novemberborn.net/sifr/2.0.2\">download
    version 2.0.2 here</a>.\r\n\r\nPlease note though that the use of Flash replacement
    techniques requires quite a bit of resources, so it is suggested you use it sparingly.
    It is my experience that anything over 10 replacements per page will start detracting
    from a user's experience."

  body: Dumb question, and likely the wrong spot to ask, but how do you run the .fla
    file? Do you need to have a Flash developing program?

    Flash editor, which are then exported as .swf, which can be run by the client."
