  Dino dos Santos, and it's a real beauty. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ban_velino04_3491.jpeg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ban_velino06_4111.jpeg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ban_velino03_4895.jpeg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
  thinking about buying the display, text, and sans. What are your thoughts?  A new
  classic or nothing special?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=90"

  body: "I really like Velino since the very first time I saw it and has the potential
    to become \u201Ca new classic\u201D, but IMHO it is too soon for calling it that
    way. For me, that term is reserved for something like Meta or Minion, i. e., a
    relatively new typeface that has been included in the exclusive circle of the
    most reliable and useful fonts according to a considerable number of professionals
    that have been using it for a wide range of projects and, after confirming that
    it works well, it is always one of the first options to do the job. It takes a
    while to get that \u2013 and I am afraid it is not just a matter of quality, but
    a mixing of quality, prestige, marketing, timing and luck (and perhaps other ingredients).\r\n\r\nBut,
    if you really like it, then go ahead! Actually, I\u2019d get a license if I had
    the money or a project for it."

  body: "I totally agree that it's of course too early to speak on its acceptance
    into the parlance of design professionals - I was mostly asking if you think it
    has the versatility, personality, and utility to become one of those elite 'new
    classics' like Meta, Minion, Miller (hmm, maybe Dino should've chosen a name beginning
    with M).\r\n\r\nAll I can say is that I'm excited to see it used, and possibly
    to use it myself one day.\r\n\r\nCongrats Dino, and happy new year to everyone!"
