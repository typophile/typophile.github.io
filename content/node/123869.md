  most leather stamp number kits. I couldn't imagine it being anything fancy. I feel
  like it's right under my nose and could even be a default typeface. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/4904-00-L_4589.JPG]"

  body: "Leatherworking and metalworking are closely related, so it most likely originated
    from something like Engravers Gothic or Sackers Gothic (but isn't a match to either).
    Like the type used in many mechanical/hand processes, it may not have a digital
    equivalent.\r\n\r\nClosest digital typeface I found was Gross (you\u2019d have
    to substitute a capital |I| for the |1|):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/words-pictures/gross/\r\n\r\nThen
    again, you could do the same substitution with Helvetica Extended and come close
    as well."

      you looking into it.
