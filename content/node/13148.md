  body: Pretty sure this is Belwe Roman, a metal face from the 1920s. It resembles
    the Letraset version (<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/belwe/" target="_blank">here</a>)
    which was done around 1980, but I don't think there is a digital version of the
    original. If you have a copy of Encyclopaedia of Type Faces, it's on page 19.
    Judging by the tight spacing, it may have been set from a film font version.

  body: "It is extremely close to George Belwe's design, but the lower case \"a\"
    throws me off a little bit.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/samples/adobe/Belwe.gif\"
    target=\"new\">http://www.identifont.com/samples/adobe/Belwe.gif</a>\r\n\r\nIn
    the late eighties, while at Agfa-Compugraphic, we released six weights of Belwe
    based on his specimens from 1926. It was the first time Belwe was available for
    phototype keyboard composition. If I recall, we still licensed the right to call
    it Belwe from Letraset/Esselte, but I might be wrong, yet it was licensed to ITC
    afterwards.\r\n\r\nIf this is a sample from 1977, then predates Agfa-CG's release.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but not as old as Belwe!"

  body: "I was a little off with the year, my book is second edition from 1979.\r\n\r\nThe
    digital versions of Belwe are close enough, but there are some small differences.
    Maybe it was customised. Or it is a design from the same Georg Belwe."
