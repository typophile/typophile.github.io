body: "Dear all,\r\n\r\nI am writing a PhD thesis in the natural sciences (chemistry,
  biochemistry). After completing the scientific part, I wish to create a professionally-looking
  layout in InDesign. This question exclusively relates to the layout part.\r\n\r\n<strong>What
  are suitable combinations of body and heading fonts for a modern, research-based
  thesis in the Sciences?</strong>\r\n\r\nMy plan is purchase a limited set of fonts
  specifically for this purpose - I do not wish to use Arial/Times New Roman.\r\n\r\nI
  have the following constraints:\r\n\r\n(1) The body font should be a serifs font,
  the heading font a sans-serif font.\r\n(2) Both fonts must contain a full set of
  Greek characters\r\n(3) The body font should read well when printed at 12/18.\r\n(4)
  Preferentially, the heading font should have separate styles suitable for the different
  sizes that it will be used at, such as for captions (8-10 pt), headings (12-14 pt)
  and larger title pages (20+ pt).\r\n\r\nMy initial thoughts were Myriad Pro/Minion
  Pro or Frutiger/Garamond Premier Pro, but I would prefer a more modern/contemporary
  body font.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or comments would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n"

    body: "The University regulations recommend (but do not require) the use of a
      12 pt font, with a \"spacing between the lines\" of approx. 8 mm. \r\nIn practice,
      however, most students are using 12 pt with 1.5-fold line spacing, i.e. 12/18.
      I guess that depending on the font choice, it would be okay to use a different
      spacing, as long as the visual appearance of the spacing is similar to Times
      New Roman set in 12/18."

  body: "Times is small on the body, so 12 makes sense. It's good\r\nto know though
    that you can choose a smaller size if the\r\nfont warrants that (meaning you're
    far less restricted in\r\nterms of font choice).\r\n\r\nConcerning linespacing,
    1.5 is generally a bit much, unless\r\nyour lines have to span the width of a
    letter-size/A4 page,\r\nwhich is not advisable. Also note that the ideal linespacing\r\ndoes
    depend on the font (mostly its x-height).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Serif Pro and Centro Sans Pro might be a possibility."

  body: "Thank you all very much for your helpful responses. \r\n\r\nI am particularly
    inclined towards using Skolar as the font for body text. In terms of capital letters,
    likely I will use full caps for abbreviations (rather than small caps), as this
    is standard in most science publications and people in the field are used to it.
    Personally, I would however prefer small caps.\r\n\r\nDo you have any recommendations
    (or can refer me to a related post) on which heading fonts would work well with
    Skolar?"
