  character sets (glyphs and other characters) need to go into what languages? I'd
  like to work with a setup where I can see what languages contain which characters,
  so that I know how to make the correct documentation for users and purchasers.\r\nIt
  would also help me not to make mistakes and oversee characters that needed to go
  into a font. That way I can work more structured updating my fonts. I will be reworking
  most of them for Fontshop, that will publish my fonts soon. ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance."

  body: Sweet George, that really helped completing the picture. The site from Ondrej
    combines all the info nicely together. If you need more details you can dissect
    it on the other links.
