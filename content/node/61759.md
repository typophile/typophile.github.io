  commercial typefaces-not our designer's old freeware releases (as popular as those
  have proven. One offer is for a copy of Crewekerne Regular in your choice of Truetype
  or Opentype formats.  The other offer is for a fully licensed copy of any single
  face of your choice from our releases to date.\r\n\r\nRead all about the two offers
