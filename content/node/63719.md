  bring it up anyway.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible for someone to add an attachment
  preview feature?\r\n\r\nI definitely appreciate the lean-and-mean spirit of this
  board. And I don't want to sound unappreciative.\r\n\r\nI just want to see if this
  feature has been discussed already."

  body: "Yes, I know how to insert an image. But it would appear that most users are
    attaching images, when they should be posting images inline.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it
    make more sense to have only ONE option for attaching/inserting files? For example,
    if the file is an image, then it gets automatically posted inline, if it is not
    an image, it gets linked.\r\n\r\nThink MyFonts... the other ID spot. WTF only
    allows inline images. No attachments.\r\n\r\nAttachments are good. Typophile should
    definitely support attachments. But shouldn't Typophile do things to encourage
    the use of insertions (when attaching is inappropriate)?"
