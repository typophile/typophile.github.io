  at the niche markets of designers and printers, but toward the population as a whole?  With
  national TV ads and the like?

    font. Does the Helvetica film count? I\u2019m going to spend some quality time
    with YouTube and see what I come up with."

  body: I've never seen a commercial for a font either, and can't seem to find anything
    like that online.  I wonder how successful a campaign like that could be?  Good
    commercials convince people to buy things they don't need and had no previous
    interest in all the time.

  body: I think its a catalogue cover. Just a random image come-across. It <em>does</em>
    remind me of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50BBNZ-ejjU">DVNO video</a>
    however.

  body: I could see Letraset having more aggressive marketing towards the general
    public, as most printers wanted little to do with them.  Makes sense.

  body: "I had that Letraset catalog. I don't remember printers having anything against
    Letraset. It was very popular with designers who didn't have a big enough budget
    to work with a type house (that was me almost always before desktop publishing
    came along). The quality was very good, and with a little skill you could do better
    setting than a commercial type house. That said, Letraset was not considered cheap.
    A sheet of Letraset in 1979 cost about $9, almost $30 in 2012 dollars. And unlike
    a modern digital font, you ran out of letters pretty quickly and only got one
    point size per sheet.\r\n\r\nLetraset advertised in graphic design magazines,
    as did most typesetting houses and manufacturers. I don't believe type advertising
    has ever been directed at the general public. Seems like it would be total a waste
    of time and money, even nowadays, when anyone with a computer is technically a
    type user."

    a font? The mainstream demographic aren't interested in fonts.

    how succesful the campaign could be. '

    typewriter and the interchangeable fonts was nice.\r\n\r\n> The mainstream demographic
    aren't interested in fonts\r\n\r\nWell I think many folks are interested to some
    degree, but since a selection of basic fonts comes preinstalled on their computer
    and tons of novelty fonts are available for free downloads, they probably just
    don't see the need to actually buy one.\r\n\r\nEven if a particular commercial
    font became a hot item with the general public, similar-looking knockoffs would
    be available for free download within a few days."
