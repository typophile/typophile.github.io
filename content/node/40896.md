  body: "L's too narrow for Johnston. Also note that the L's are not the same width
    which suggests that this is the work of a wartime lettering artist. It reminds
    me of a wartime (WW2) poster that was on here a couple of months ago which probably
    wasn't exactly identified at the time either. Hmmmm. Not sure really, but definitely
    'Ditchling-esque'.\r\n\r\nIt raises an interesting proposition, that of an LL
    ligature where the first arm is shorter. Anyone else come across that? Should
    the arm of an L change its length depending on the next character. Is that even
    OpenTypossible?"

  body: Think it's a trademark so all the more likely to be custom. Quick internet
    search reveals nothing to do with WW2 so sorry about that! Can't find that poster
    thread so sorry again.
