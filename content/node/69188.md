body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm a graphic design student researching justified text, and wondered
  if anybody knew of some examples of brilliant (or terrible!) justified text? Previous
  forums have discussed whether it's a good idea or not, but I'm really looking for
  real examples of successful justification (possibly including pre-computers and
  pre-type, as one forum entry mentioned manuscripts written by monks).   If anybody
  could recommend some books too, that'd be great.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "You would be well-served to research not only examples of good justification,
    but also technique, everything from abbreviation to glyph scaling, from Johannes
    Gutenberg to H\xE0n Th\u1EBF Th\xE0nh.\r\n\r\nThere are some useful links in this
    thread: http://typophile.com/node/64375\r\n\r\nYour research would also not be
    complete without noting Eric Gill's dissension as to the wisdom of justified text,
    which can be found in \xA76 of <em>An Essay on Typography.</em>\r\n\r\nIf you
    want to see what a modern justification engine is capable of, you can read the
    documentation for the <code>microtype</code> package in LaTeX: [[http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/microtype/microtype.pdf|microtype.pdf]].
    Even if you read the section headings and nothing else, it will give you the vocabulary
    to describe what such software is capable of.\r\n\r\nThe following figure illustrates
    what can be accomplished with tracking alone (for good or ill).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/microtype_package_4254.png]"

  body: In the case of monk-generated manuscripts, I have seen some that approach
    justification through just ending one line in the middle of a word, and then continuing
    to the next. And then there are the books set entirely without word spacing. I
    tend to think these were do to semi-literate monks who merely copied letter after
    letter, without understanding the concept of words.
