  looking at a minimum of $220 to replace them. I no longer use it for color work,
  it\u2019s loud as hell, and has no postscript support. Can I get a decent postscript
  BW laser for less than what it\u2019s going to cost me to refill this thing?"

  body: "James... HP has the best BW printers in my mind. I started off with them,
    switched to a NewGen/Design XP 1200 dpi printer for 4K and promptly went back
    to the HP when I could no longer afford the refills. Bad investment as the cartridges
    were 250$. I like the black crispness of the HP's and they take a licking and
    keep on ticking!\r\n\r\nP.s. could you give me your addie so I can contact you
    about riding up to Buffalo. typerror@aol.com\r\n\r\nMichael"
