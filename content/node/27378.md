  Typophile forum for it, the closest match that I could find was Dan Reynolds commendation
  on a book set with RdR in its digital incarnation \u2013 at that time, unavailable
  to the public.\r\n\r\nSo how has things progressed two years from then?"

    digital typeface out of it. But it isn't on my plate :-(\r\n\r\nI heard a rumor
    that one of the students who graduated from the Type and Media program in the
    Hague this year made an RdR revival in his spare time there. Don't know who it
    was, though. And I haven't seen the actual thing. "

    it was a part of my research project, now i m working on this typeface, i hope
    that i can release this typeface on my new typefoundry (B&P) in november or december.\r\n\r\ni

    I loved about RdR was how it appeared <em>humane</em>, at least from what I've
    seen on books and papers. I hope that its revival can shine a new light on this
    much coveted type.\r\n\r\nGodspeed, ianp. Godspeed."

  body: "I have some answers to queries about the <em>romain du roi</em> that have
    appeared in several recent threads. Maybe it will be helpful to set them out here,
    even if it means a rather long post.\r\nSo far as I know, no full printed character
    set has ever been formally published of any of the sizes of the <em>romain du
    roi</em> , the type which is currently known at the Imprimerie nationale as <em>Le
    Grandjean,</em>, from the name of the first punchcutter, Philippe Grandjean. \r\nThere
    are 21 sizes of capitals and lower case for this type, for bodies from 4 to 56
    points IN. (The \u2018point IN\u2019 of the Imprimerie nationale is a unique system
    of bodies, being just under 0.4 mm. It is the result of a new set of \u2018millimetric\u2019
    type bodies introduced in 1812 in order to link directly to the metric system.
    The Didot point is 0.376 mm and the US point 0.351 mm) \r\nThere are also complete
    sets of small capitals, in roman and italic, and also figures in roman and italic
    too (perhaps the first instance of the addition of italic forms in both cases).
    And there is a complete and distinct set of \u2018titling\u2019 or \u2018two-line\u2019
    capitals, the largest of which are for casting on a body of 112 points. They are
    very fine types.\r\nThe <em>romain du roi</em> was cut from 1696 to about 1745,
    by Grandjean and his two successors as official punchcutters (Jean Alexandre and
    Louis Luce), and some design features vary considerably from size to size as they
    do in any hand-cut type of the period. (The thick strokes of the larger sizes
    have a relatively heavier weight, which was often normal in the 18th century.)\r\nThe
    <em>romain du roi</em> was still used for some time during the early years of
    the 19th century, and was used to set the big <em>Description de l\u2019\xC9gypte</em>,
    begun in 1809, that was referred to recently in another thread. Perhaps because
    he did not want to go on using the old type, Napoleon had a new one specially
    made by Firmin Didot in 1811, which is known at the IN as the <em>Didot millim\xE9trique</em>.
    It might have become known as the romain de l\u2019empereur if Napoleon had lasted.
    At the return of the monarchy it went under a cloud, but some sizes were recast
    and used for fine printing in the 1970s. The <em>romain du roi</em> was recast
    from original matrices in 1900 and has been used for fine hand printing at the
    IN ever since, and for some quite long texts.\r\nSo much for the type. There are
    two main questions to answer. What has happened at the Imprimerie nationale? And
    what sources are there for the <em>romain du roi</em> ?\r\nThe Imprimerie nationale,
    or IN (which was privatized in 1994, with the state as a majority shareholder)
    was restructured in 2003 and sold its building in central Paris. The main industrial
    plants are now at Douai and other sites in France. For basic information see http://www.imprimerienationale.fr/impnat.asp\r\nThe
    craft-based activities, which include intaglio and direct lithographic print-making
    as well as typefounding, hand typesetting and punchcutting, were moved to a modern
    building just outside Paris, at Ivry sur Seine. This division of the IN is known
    as the Atelier du livre or \u2018book workshop\u2019, and concentrates on fine
    printing and print-making. Christian Paput, chief punchcutter for many years,
    took his retirement in 2005. The moving of the hundreds of thousands of punches
    and matrices that make up the Cabinet des poin\xE7ons and their installation at
    Ivry was organized by Madame Nelly Gable, who is now the official punchcutter.
    (She is the first woman ever known to have entered the profession.) To answer
    one question straight away: no, visitors are not permitted there, for the time
    being anyway.\r\nSources for the <em>romain du roi</em>. \r\nThe last type specimen
    published by the IN was issued in 1990 under the title <em>Les caract\xE8res de
    l\u2019Imprimerie Nationale</em>. I do not know if copies are still available
    from the IN, but secondhand ones should be findable online. It shows specimens
    of many sizes of le Grandjean, but (whether by accident or design I don\u2019t
    know) does not provide character sets of any of them. It does, however, show a
    full character set of the 36 point <em>Didot millim\xE9trique</em>, and in answer
    to another recent thread, my impression is that this may just possibly be the
    source of the unnamed heading font that can be seen at Le Typographe (http://www.typographe.com/),
    a blog that stems from the operation of Jean-Fran\xE7ois Porchez.\r\nThe plates
    of alphabets that were engraved from 1695 onwards have been reproduced several
    times. A small edition (with an excellent introductory essay) was reprinted from
    the original plates in Andr\xE9  Jammes, <em>La r\xE9forme de la typographie royale
    sous Louis XIV: le Grandjean.</em> Paris, 1961. A more affordable reduced facsimile
    of this publication (A4 format) was published in 1985 under a confusingly different
    title, <em>La naissance d\u2019un caract\xE8re: le Grandjean.</em> Paris: Promodis,
    1985. This ought to be findable secondhand. (There is also a set of very reduced,
    and frankly not very good, reproductions of the plates, along with an English
    translation of the essay by Jammes, in the first issue of the <em>Journal of the
    Printing Historical Society</em>, 1965.) I hardly need to say that these alphabets
    are not \u2018type designs\u2019. Maybe \u2018explorations of the possibilities
    for new forms of letters\u2019 would be a better term. The idea (promoted by Fournier
    le jeune, who had his own axe to grind) that Grandjean in some way rescued an
    unreal academic exercise with his practical punchcutter\u2019s skills is more
    than a bit na\xEFf. (I looked at it in a piece in the Reading University journal
    <em>Typography papers</em>, no. 2. http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/titles/typo_papers2/index.html)
    His first set of punches was so bad that it was rejected and dumped.\r\nThe most
    recent source of images and information (in French) relating to the whole project
    is the exhibition catalogue, <em>Le romain du roi: la typographie au service de
    l\u2019\xE9tat.</em> Lyon: Mus\xE9e de l\u2019imprimerie, 2002. This is available
    from Frits Knuf antiquarian books at Vend\xF4me in France (http://www.fritsknuf.com/)
    at 30 euros. There are reproductions of some of the plates of roman and italic
    alphabets, and also of a complete and very rare specimen of the original types,
    issued in 1760. \r\nBy the by. That sloped roman italic was intended experimentally
    as a distinct third type, and not as a replacement for the normal cursive italic.
    It was rejected at the time as too like the roman, but Benjamin Franklin had a
    version of his own made. See the catalogue.\r\nHaving been much involved in its
    making, I can\u2019t be objective about the catalogue, but I think it may be worth
    having, if only for the quality of the images of the original punches and matrices.
    (We did a shoot at the IN, and had a good budget for colour printing.) But it
    does not include a complete character set of the romain du roi.\r\nSome points
    to conclude with. \r\n<strong>Copyright.</strong> Everybody seems to know that
    it was forbidden (under pain of death, wrote Philip Meggs) to copy the <em>romain
    du roi</em>. But that is just not true, or was not in the 18th century. (A quite
    close copy of one size came out within a few years and was on sale in France for
    decades.) However, during the Revolution when it was found that the English were
    faking official posters and sowing confusion with them in order to destabilize
    the r\xE9gime, it was decided to use the old royal type, with its distinctive
    letter l, for all official publications, and the design of this \u2018National
    type\u2019 (as they now called it) was protected by law. At the restoration of
    the monarchy, this protection was retained, and extended to all the special types
    made for the state printing operation. I have a feeling that, despite all the
    many changes of r\xE9gime, this law may still operate in France. So be careful.
    The digital Grandjean currently in use by the IN (and used for the 2002 catalogue)
    was made for them by Frank Jalleau. I have made one of my own, for purely personal
    use.\r\n<strong>The future of the Atelier du livre.</strong> The present setup
    is frankly provisional, and not intended to be permanent. Two representatives
    of the French ministries responsible for keeping an eye on the \u2018heritage\u2019
    side of the IN have drawn up a report with a recommended course of action \u2013
    but nobody has seen it or knows what is in it. For developments as they take place
    it is worth checking the site of the effective watchdog and support group at http://www.garamonpatrimoine.org/\r\nLastly,
    there is a project under consideration at the Atelier du livre for reprinting
    some of the alphabet plates. I\u2019ll post details when I know them.\r\nI hope
    that there is useful material somewhere in all this.\r\n"

  body: I'm at loss for words. Very useful stuff that I'll have to take time to read
    again to digress fully. The 2002 edition that you mentioned was also exactly the
    one that I'm looking for. Thanks for giving me the direct source and shining more
    light into this matter!
