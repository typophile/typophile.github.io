  have noticed to recent increase in spam on Typophile. We are finding that they are
  creating multiple usernames in a very short period of time, bogging down the system
  and filling the forums with garbage.\r\n\r\nSo, for a very short time this weekend,
  we are disabling new user registration for visitors. We'll turn it back on as soon
  as we can find a solution for the spam attacks.\r\n\r\nHope this isn't going to
  cause too much of an inconvenience for anyone!\r\n\r\nEnjoy your weekend :)"

  body: "Zara, that's a good solution for the time being, and I'm glad you did it.\r\n\r\nj_polo9&#8212;that
    doesn't make sense. If somebody was angry about harsh critique wouldn't they want
    to suppress that material? Posting spam isn't an effective way of suppressing
    free speech. It's more likely attention-getting spam in the classic sense of the
    word, you know, spam for spam'sake.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    and it did not increased any sales ... I wonder if there is a r*d guy out there
    with a list, ready to publish ...

  body: "Note to Punchcut&#8212;are you able to block an incoming IP address? That
    would be another way of stopping the spammer. The spammer, being a spammer, isn't
    likely to switch internet service solely for the privelege of posting more of
    their spam at Typophile. More likely they'll move on to the next public forum
    and try their luck there.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
