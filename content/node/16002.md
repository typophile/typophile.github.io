body: "Hey there,i was wondering if anyone has run into this problem before and whether
  ya'll know how to fix it.\r\nMy fonts are all edgy and pixelated within freehand
  so it is a nightmare trying to get it looking nice,the only way i can check it is
  by creating a pdf and viewing it in Acrobat.I have fiddled with the preview modes
  in freehand and also looked at the minimum readability thing in my system preferences.\r\nbah!
  any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n-Al"

  body: This could be stating the obvious, but it looks like you have anti-aliasing
    turned off.

  body: "What type of fonts are in use? TT, Type1, OT? I used to notice that either
    my TT or Type1 fonts looked jagged on screen (this hasn't been the case for a
    long time, so I can't remember which rendered jagged). (I wonder if that had something
    to do with ATM, which I used to use until it became unnecessary.)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I believe it's possible to anti-alias a vector object (the circles) but still
    have anti-aliasing turned off for text, so that may still be at issue. However,
    I'm also speaking from ignorance; I gave Freehand a shot about 4 years ago and
    came right back home to Illustrator. Haven't touched that hand since."

    displaying.

    you print.

    you have copied them into your user fonts folder but are also loading them into
    suitcase? If that is the case it could be a conflict problem. "
