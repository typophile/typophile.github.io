    do better.

  body: "Yes, that IS so terrible. I can dig into deeper with this, cause I know I
    have read about it somewhere, who designed these shirts (I dont believe it\u2019s
    a swede at all but the clothing company that produces the clothes). When these
    sweaters were first seen, almost anyone I know felt it was an embarrasing bad
    design.\r\n\r\nI guess the football-lobbyists havent understood what design is
    all about. cos I never seen a good swedish national clothes outfit in modern ages
    yet... and I am swedish... (but doesn\u2019t play football)\r\n\r\nIf I find the
    article I will post it here, so whoever did it can be ashamed ;-)"

    surprised they can design at all, what with all the hot Scandinavian distractions
    bouncing around in their teeny bikinis. "
