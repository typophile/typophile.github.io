body: "I recently designed a logo for an on-campus publication that will be circulated
  twice a semester to all the teachers at my school. The name for the publication
  is The Spotlight and for now it will be distributed in print with an online version
  coming in a few months. The audience is college professors and the focus of the
  newsletter is to inform them about how they can incorporate technology in their
  teaching. My school is fairly small and as a result so is the audience.\r\n\r\nAt
  this point in the logo design I'm not at liberty to make any major revisions. Still,
  I would like to make the best logo possible and so would appreciate your comments
  (even if they require major revision).\r\n\r\nOur first edition is going to print
  this Monday, so time is short. My main concern before the first printing is the
  kerning, particularly between the \"li.\" I originally had them touching, but I
  thought that reduced legibility too much. What do you think?\r\n\r\nAs a side note,
  print design is still quite foreign to me, so can anyone point me to some good tips
  or guidelines for designing newsletters and magazines? My typographic skill, while
  still on a beginner's level, is fairly solid. I've read [[Robert Bringhurst]]'s
  book, which taught me a lot, but are there any resources (particularly on the web)
  that focus more specifically on designing for newsletters, magazines, newspapers,
  etc.?\r\n\r\nThanks so much. I'm looking forward to your input.\r\n"

  body: I would suggest some enlightenment, as your logo (it's designed to bring the
    light of technology, eh?) looks a little bit too dogmatic, narrow, solidly dark
    and black to my eyes.

  body: "Sorry Peter, that has that early 70's look when they kerned everything so
    tight they turned god into dog. As Stephen said it looks very dark and black and
    that might be because of the lack of breathing room between the characters. I
    seriously doubt the type designer ever imagined his/her work should have the characters
    crashed together like that. Its a good start, but a start.\r\n\r\n"

  body: That is a world better. I think it works well for your newsletter. I think
    it will be well accepted. Good job

  body: "Peter-\r\nI don't know if this will be helpful or not, but a website I think
    is pretty good, particularly for those new to design or who make it just a small
    portion of their job is <a href=\"http://www.ideabook.com\"> Ideabook.</a> It's
    put together by a designer named Chuck Green. Navigate through the site and you'll
    find some great tips on clean, organized and thoughtful newsletter design, logo
    design, etc.\r\nBest of luck."
