  for this logo for an animal shelter and clinic in Arizona. \r\n\r\nI want to come
  up with colors that embody the animals as well as the professional location they
  are.\r\n\r\nThey have had many poor logos created for them in the past. And, unfortunately
  that is the case for most non-profits. This is why I want to make this one GREAT!\r\n\r\nPlease
  help. This is what I have come up with so far.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for all
  your expertise!\r\n"

  body: 'I have definitely seen this concept before, with better execution no less.  The
    sharp taper on the left side of the icon is distracting, and the details of the
    silhouettes are inconsistent.  Why are you using a mark, an acronym, and a full
    name?  Particularly, the acronym seems superfluous.  '

  body: "I agree that the slope on the left edge is distracting. Regarding the general
    concept -- a figure-ground effect using animal silhouettes -- it has indeed been
    used many times, but there are millions of logos in use and any logo you create
    is bound to have resemblances to others. The important thing is that it fits the
    client and is well executed. But I'd check to make sure that other animal-related
    companies in your area aren't using anything similar.\r\n\r\nThe font looks a
    bit corporate to me; you might try something with a friendlier look.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    colors, I'd probably stay away from the blues and greens and try earth tones (maybe
    a rust color?)."

  body: "You might be right.  I have probably been exposed to these kind of images
    way more than the average person.  Still the idea could be one of the concepts
    you have to get past to find a great idea.  To me it still seems too obvious and
    generic, not memorable enough.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.123rf.com/photo_3971198_veterinary-logo.html\r\nhttp://www.prlog.org/10260558-business-logo.jpg\r\nhttp://www.istockphoto.com/stock-illustration-15454470-pet-silhouette.php?st=22a1c1a\r\nhttp://logopond.com/gallery/detail/40114\r\nhttp://logopond.com/gallery/detail/55521\r\nhttp://logopond.com/gallery/detail/139447\r\nhttp://logopond.com/gallery/detail/116481\r\nhttp://www.elkcountyhumanesociety.org/logo.gif\r\nhttp://www.petclinicofneosho.com/images/petclinic.jpg\r\nhttp://ozgeozva301.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/petshop_logo.jpg\r\nhttp://media.merchantcircle.com/25380407/ISAR%20dog%20cat%20logo_full.jpeg\r\nhttp://www.doctorted.net/CatDogLogo2.JPG\r\nhttp://a0.twimg.com/profile_images/508842460/Olathe_Animal_Hospital_Logo_green_bigger.jpg\r\nhttp://amberyanimalhospital.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/AmberyLogo1.png\r\nhttp://www.1stwebdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/helping-hands-for-pets-logo-negative-space1.jpg\r\nhttp://www.byersplumbing.com/images/dog_cat_petfriendly.jpg\r\n"

  body: "Luma, I agree with you that the concept been used a lot. \r\n\r\nAnd not
    just for animal-related organizations; the Girl Scouts for instance use a similar
    figure-ground technique in their logo, and I'm sure there are countless other
    examples, too.\r\nhttp://www.famouslogos.org/logos/girl-scouts-logo.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm
    just saying that figure-ground is a pretty basic design technique. It's been around
    a long time and will continue to be used long after we're gone. But I agree it's
    not the most original solution."

  body: "The major stumbling point here is that there are a lot of elements here,
    and generally they are not working together, or even in tune with each other.
    Introducing the circle complicates things more as it is working more as an independent
    element rather than a mechanism to bring the composition together.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    this is coming across as not being a unique idea, that's ok, as long as it is
    put together well, I am sure the client will be happy, and most small business
    don't have the budget to have a designer spends days and days looking for the
    perfect new solution.\r\n\r\nI would suggest taking a step back, and look at the
    base elements of the design, which to me are fine, just need some thoughts and
    tuning, mainly with the type, layout and colour rather than graphic concept.\r\n\r\nHow
    about working from the perspective of the name, animal rescue has a dynamic about
    it, yet to this point the colours and composition are quite corporate and pedestrian.
    Maybe it should be approached as a badge that someone would wear embroidered on
    a uniform - like, these guys go out and do rescues, not Joes pet shop. "
