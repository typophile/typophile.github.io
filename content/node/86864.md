  3.0</strong> for Mac won\u2019t export <em>transparent PNGs</em> as Images. \r\n\r\nSince
  there is almost no point to export them like this, if there is no option of making
  them transparent \u2013 i\u2019m maybe doing something wrong here? \r\n\r\n<em>Tools/Filter/Remove
  Background</em> and the <em>Glyph Preview Windows</em> or even <em>View/Transparency</em>
  let you assume, that the data itself is layered on a transparent background. \r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would be helpful \u2019cause I\u2019m really stuck here. Thanks! "

    export PNGs with transparency unless I select the 24-bit option...

  body: Hmm... Isn't there some dark magic (some script-fu, a netpbm chain or some
    other hack) that lets you use a greyscale image as an alpha channel in another
    image, thus getting transparency?

  body: 'BTW, I just wanted to point out that, if you decide to store your PNGs outside
    of the PHF file (BitFonter: Preferences / Export / Photofont / Put glyph data:
    Outside of font file), you''ll get a regular PNG which you can then post-process
    in any PNG editor (my preferred one in this case is Adobe Fireworks as it uses
    PNG natively). Any photofont will then "instantly update". No need to open and
    re-save in BitFonter. '

  body: "Thanks guys. Right, the PNGs fo\u2019 sure need to be 24-bit to be transparent.
    The point is, that <em>BitFonter</em> previews glyphs like this, but there seems
    no way to get them outta there. Some <em>PS -Action or -Droplet</em> should hopefully
    keep going where <em>BitFonter</em> dropped the ball. \r\n@twardoch Thanks for
    the tip! Will try that and see how <em>Fireworks</em> will do. Unfortunately there
    are +1000 glyphs that need to be processed. The final result shall be a folder
    full of PNGs, dunno how to use a photofont properly, yet. "
