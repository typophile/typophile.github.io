<p>I&rsquo;m trying to decide which fonts might be have the best readability for this audience. I would appreciate any suggestions.</p>
<p>I am considering Leitura News and Leitura Sans. Both come in four weights, and the the no. 2 weight of each is somewhere between a regular roman and a semibold, which strikes me as ideal, bigger than the usual body text, but not screamingly big.</p>
<p>I also am considering Warnock Pro, but it is a bit delicate looking for my purposes.</p>
<p>Any suggestions from you experts?</p>

<p>The article recommends using fonts that have:
• Consistent stroke widths
• Open counterforms
• Pronounced ascenders and descenders
• Wider horizontal proportions
• More distinct forms for each character (such as tails on the lowercase letters “t” and “j”)
• Extended horizontal strokes for certain letterforms (such as the arm of the lowercase letter “r” or the crossbar of the lowercase letter “t”)</p>

<p>I think the EULA you quoted was also forbidding use of that font in an interactive PDF (for example a survey form in PDF format with blank fields that the user fills in on their computer before returning the PDF to the survey company). You should be safe because it sounds like your PDF will be read-only.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If your readers are blind, I recommend Braille.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re about to undergo eye surgery its probably because they can&rsquo;t read anymore. I had a grandma with a cataract once. She had 10% vision left in that eye. We ended up having to put her down. But that&rsquo;s besides the point. I think you should get a typeface that capitalizes on a 10% reading and recognition level. A big slab serif, like Morgan, Jubilat,or Neutraface. Would work well at 172 pts. Because even when slabs are blurry, like being drunk or almost blind, the definitions of which letters they are still end up being legible. I really think Jubilat looks great in pdfs. Its like the unofficial defacto pdf typeface. If you must go sans, I would stick with blacks. Like they say once you go black&hellip; You&rsquo;ll never go ultra lol. Joke. But seriously, ultras tend to get condensed on the details, like on S especially. And bold may not be as impacting as you need, depending on the typeface. Akagi black is good. So is Alright black. Gotham, may be one of those blacks that just look too thin and open. However, using Gotham ultra retains details better than Akagi black I think. Design the ebook first, worry about EULAS latter.</p>
