body: 'I was wondering a couple of days ago if there has been variations in the size
  of book types trough history. <BR> <BR>I have the impression that typefaces of the
  XV and XVI centuries were printed in sizes of about 14 points, and read somewhere
  that during the XIX century mondern types were frequently printed in sizes of about
  7 or 8 points. <BR> <BR>I know that today nobody would think of setting a normal
  book page in sizes as extreme as 7 or 14 points, but what about 100 or 400 years
  ago? <BR> <BR> <BR>BTW, I just found out that the first fully digital typeface was
  Hermann Zapf&#39;s Marconi in 1976 &#40;according to Gerard Unger: <a href="http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns04.html"

  body: In the book _Counter punch_ there is a reference to the earliest cutting of
    very small text size faces. <BR> <BR>Since book work is determined by conventional
    parent paper sizes, today and to some extent, always, there is only a certain
    range of point sizes that are appropriate. Early paper sizes were regulated in
    regard to size based on previous formats, which were based on the size of animal
    skins, e.g., goats, calves. An elephant folio sheet was one entire animal. Uterine
    calf was used for miniatures &#40;both mother and unborn were sacrificed&#41;.
    The monestaries dedicated to scribal work were mass slaughterhouses, but set the
    standard that we still abide by. <BR> <BR>14-point is hardly an extremely large
    size however. The fine printer-publisher William Everson, who worked in larger
    format, recommended 16-pt as the ideal size for bookwork. Victor Hammer often
    worked at the larger end of the spectrum as well. There is some validity in this
    as most faces do seem to show their form best at larger sizes. This may be more
    a fine press/letterpress thing though. Fairly large text sizes are much more friendlier
    in regard to presswork. And, then there is the market as well; larger format books
    tend to have a higher selling price and are more likely to attract collectors.

  body: Some of the finest printing from small type, in very small pocket books, was
    done by the Elzeviers in the late 16th and 17th centuries. They also produced
    books at larger sizes, using larger type, up to folio size, but their small books
    are justly admired. The body type is usually about equivalent to 7pt or 8pt.

    <BR> <BR>Write in Latin. <BR> <BR>The Latin language looks better in the Latin
    script than any other tongue. There is an eveness of texture in the Latin language
    set in renaissance types that nothing else in our script matches. Jan Tschichold
    makes a similar observation in <i>The form of the book.</i>

    there is a big difference in \"brevier\". I tried to give a translation of some
    of the names (second row). I don't know if the actual size of type has been different
    due to the different units in american type. If this would be true an american
    \"nonpareil\" would differ in size from a german \"nonpareil\". But of course
    an old \"Minion\" with 7 didot-point was bigger in size than our 7 dtp-point.
    To get a \"Minion\"-size we ought to set in 7,44 pt (and of course depending on
    the actual shape of the glyphs on the body)."

  body: John <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve only had one occasion to set Latin but I quite enjoyed
    it. I think though that your point about its typographic colour and the incidence
    of vowels is the result of how easily it can thus be hyphenated &#40;and its differing
    rules regarding hyphenation&#41;, with the consequence that word spacing can be
    uniformly tighter. This is not the case with roman languages derived from Latin.

  body: As an addenda to this I should add that Latin as seen in early printing &#40;incunabular&#41;
    followed the manuscript traditon in regard to the use of word abbreviations and
    associated symbols. There were far more options available to ensure tight spacing
    and uniform color.

  body: Yes, although this had changed by the time of the Elzevier editions referred
    to above, and most scribal abbreviations were abandoned. The point about hyphenation
    and evenness of word spacing is well made, but I think there is also a simple
    pleasantness in the frequency of certain letters and repetition of combinations
    in Latin. I recently set a bi-lingual Mass booklet for a friend&#39;s ordination,
    using the Dante types, and the Latin columns look much more magesterial than the
    English &#40;in part, I admit, because Latin is a more efficient language, so
    I had to use a smaller point size for the English&#41;.

  body: 'Regarding the distinction between traditional and old fashioned. Especially
    in the context of religion, I take an etymological stance on tradition: always
    remembering that it is from the Latin verb <i>traditio,</i> to hand on. Tradition
    is all about passing on of something of inherent value from one generation to
    another. Conversely, old-fashioned implies simply doing something superficially
    in the way it used to be done, without critically considering whether the thing
    has inherent value. The kind of ultramodernism to which you refer is similarly
    uncritical, in that it tends to treat all tradition as if it were merely a matter
    of fashion and taste, and not of inherent value. Some traditionalists, of course,
    make the opposite mistake, and in their fervour to defend tradition against modernist
    or post-modernist assault will adopt a reactionary position that clings to anything
    old-fashioned as a kind of reassurance. It seems to me that the only healthy position
    in all these options is that of true tradition: which requires a critical consideration
    of both past and present, but with dutiful acceptance of what is handed to us,
    maintaining it and handing it on in our turn, <i>and erring on the side of this
    </i>traditio<i> if we are uncertain about or unable to understand the value of

    wrote that, having stayed up the night before to watch the live feed of the Pope&#39;s
    innaugural Mass, itself a study in both tradition and innovation. Watching Benedict
    XVI and the eastern rite patriarchs incense the tomb of Peter before the Mass,
    it was difficult to believe that this is a new addition to the innauguration of
    a Pope, which has never been included in the ceremony before: it is an innovation
    that joins to the tradition without the seams being visible.'

    Masses on St. Peters place are aesthetical, liturgical and medial events of their
    own. For me it&#39;s very interesting how outer symbols of doing, color, textiles
    and rites show inner structures of meaning. And of course as a theologian and
    fellow countryman &#40;I live about 100 km from where Benedict XVI. comes&#41;
    I&#39;m very interested about every move of innovation joined to tradition by
    this Pope. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to start a new thread about Missal and prayerbook
    design next week &#40;for this week my duties do not allow much work on it&#41;.'

    what I can as I go along. I have a basic understanding of grammar, and can often
    guess the noun declension and verb tense from the ending. I can follow the ordinary
    of the Mass very well, of course, and the psalms that we repeat during vespers
    and compline, but beyond that I&#39;m either making guesses &#40;often wrong&#41;
    or looking at the English translation.'
