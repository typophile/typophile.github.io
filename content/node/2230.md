    ALT=":&#41;">  <BR> <BR>FWIW this was started in 1991 using nothing but Fontographer.
    I put it away for several years and started making some adjustments recently,
    but what you see here is hardly changed from what I had almost 10 years ago. '

  body: ' Hmm, this forum has a way of provoking people to dust off their old, partially
    developed fonts. More power to &#39;em. <BR> <BR>Nice font, by the way. I like
    it in general. The serifs seem to need a little work, perhaps. The serifs in certain
    instances seem slightly overbearing: at the apex of the UC A as well as the lc
    e, for example. <BR> <BR>Does the UC M seem a little timid? &#40;Perhaps the middle
    should extend further down?&#41; <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>//joe '
