body: "I'm working on a project at school which requires using The Sydney Opera House
  as a loose theme for a stationary system. I'm having trouble choosing an appropriate
  typeface for this. If you're not familiar with the Opera House- building commenced
  in 1958 and the architect, Jorn Utzon was Danish (his design won a competition).
  The building is described as a piece of expressionist architecture and has become
  an Australian icon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Opera_House). I'm quite
  new to typography and after some research the closest that I've come to what I'm
  looking for is a Kabel by Rudolph Koch- an example of German expressionism, but
  I'm  sure there must be something more suitable. \r\n\r\nAny ideas? \r\n\r\nThanks!"
