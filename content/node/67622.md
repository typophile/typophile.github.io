    commercial photo-type. Closest present day font I can find is Bob Alonso's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/flix/|Flix]].\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I agree that this looks hand drawn. I copied the image and placed it in Photoshop.
    Then I copied individual characters and superimposed them. The F's, N's and R's
    all seem to be slightly different.\r\n\r\nRob Leuschke"
