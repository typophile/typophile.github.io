  recently standardized all exterior building signage as Whitney semi-bold [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100026|[Hoefler

  that university purchased Whitney for the other design consultant to use, should
  my design group have access to that typeface too? Or do we need the university to
  purchase another  license, as we are two separate businesses?  \r\n\r\nI know this

    wishes to use the same typeface, your design group would need to purchase that
    license. Unless the university is kind enough to purchase a license for you, I
    don't think they are obligated to do so.

  body: "I can see Gemma's dilemma: the licensing requirements for the font seem to
    contrast with the client's perception that they are buying the same thing twice
    for only one use. This is an issue that designers deal with all the time with
    all sorts of digital assets: fonts, photos, illustrations, original layouts, etc.\r\n\r\nIf
    a client requires that you use a typeface that you do not have, that may be an
    opportunity to have them purchase it for you (as apparently the other designer
    managed to do so). But no, now neither you nor the university have any claim to
    his font. I would say that most clients that do pay for typefaces don't fully
    grasp that this isn't necessarily something they get to walk away with. \r\n\r\nWhether
    you want to openly press the university to cover the cost or whether you eat it
    as just the price of doing business (and thereby distinguish yourself from the
    other designer) is really your call. "

  body: "Should an agency/studio pass along its font licence costs to the client?\r\n\r\nAlthough
    the agency may get fonts for use on one client's job, it can subsequently use
    the fonts on work for other clients.\r\n\r\nIs it unprofessional to use the same
    fonts on work for different clients? After all, if clients pay for an unusual
    font, shouldn't they get some measure of exclusivity? If the typeface is in more
    common usage, as Gotham is, why should the client pay for something that has little
    exclusivity, and will probably be used by the agency on work for other clients?\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to be a judgement call for the agency/studio, based on the re-usability
    of the fonts, and their cost as a proportion of the initial job expenses.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    it makes more sense to budget a \"new font cost\" factor as a general overhead
    into the hourly rate -- unless one is going to restrict one's practice to fonts
    bundled with applications and OS's.\r\n\r\nThat may seem like padding to some
    clients, if all they want is in fact a bundled font, but in that case they're
    using the wrong agency/studio.\r\n\r\nEven if you decide to make font licensing
    a general overhead cost, it may still be necessary to charge certain clients for
    exceptional font licence purchases.\r\n\r\n"

    of the job.\r\n\r\nUsually, though, If I'm getting a typeface, I want it too,
    so I usually just buy it and treat it as a business expense like any software.
    Then I can use it down the road.\r\n\r\nIf I buy the font and the client also
    wants it for their own in-house use, then they buy their own license in addition
    to the one I bought.\r\n\r\nIn the end, your own billing practices are irrelevant.
    All that matters (ethically/legally speaking) is that all concurrent users of
    the typeface have a license from the type foundry."

    Interesting loophole. I imagine the paperwork involved wouldn't justify it, though.\r\n\r\nBut,
    yea, in theory, one could just keep reselling the license back in forth, uninstall,
    install, uninstall again, reinstall. \r\n\r\n"
