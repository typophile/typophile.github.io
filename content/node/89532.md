    the market?</cite>\r\n\r\nFor language support look at the large encodings of
    successful vendors like Vllg, H&FJ, etc. Display fonts can sell well with a smaller
    character set, for example, you can cash in on American design trends and sell
    well with a stripped-down Latin-1 font. Unless you are being paid to address them
    it is safe to ignore things like old Irish orthography, Esperanto, and Klingon.\r\n\r\n<cite>What's
    the market looking for when buying fonts?</cite>\r\n\r\nThat depends entirely
    on the design of the font. Publication designers, package designers, and sign
    shops buy entirely different stuff.\r\n\r\n<cite>Thoughts on font scalability?
    What is the lowest size do you test your typefaces out on.</cite>\r\n\r\nThis
    is determined by the style, weight, and purpose of the font. A font optimized
    for text gets tested at text sizes. A hairline sans serif has to be tested at
    large sizes because even a 2400 DPI laser printer can\u2019t render it correctly
    below 18 points, and that\u2019s if you have a $30,000 color Xante and the humidity
    is just right.\r\n\r\n<cite>Is there much profit to be made in selling at foundries?</cite>\r\n\r\nSure.
    Especially if you don\u2019t have the inclination to set up a business, create
    an online store, etc. etc.. You can do pretty well selling through vendors like
    Fontspring and Font Bros. that pay a bigger royalty if you can promote yourself.\r\n\r\n<cite>Any
    tips/advice would be greatly appreciated.</cite>\r\n\r\nMost people in the font
    industry are friendly, trustworthy, and not the least bit interested in screwing
    anybody over. That said:\r\n- Read a contract repeatedly before signing it. Talk
    to a lawyer if you don\u2019t understand any of it.\r\n- Don\u2019t sign a deal
    for a royalty rate below 50%.\r\n- Don\u2019t sign a deal that allows the vendor
    to deduct any business costs, including marketing, from your royalties.\r\n- Only
    sign an exclusivity agreement if the vendor is doing a lot of finishing and production
    work that you would never get done yourself. Or if the vendor is willing to commit
    a lot of money to marketing your font.\r\n- Don\u2019t sign any contract that
    never expires. You have no way of knowing what a vendor will be doing in five
    years, or who might own the vendor.\r\n- Never sign away ownership of your copyrights
    or trademarks. "

    good advice, but if it is your one and only font, your not going to do very well
    anyway. At least money wise. There may be a lot of people telling you how great
    it is, but they rarely buy anything"

    whatever that may be?</cite>\r\n\r\nAn OEM license is a license for a software
    maker to include the font in software packages. These licenses are quite expensive.
    The big foundries claim that they do a lot of negotiating for these licenses and
    so royalties on OEM sales are in the 20 \u2013\_30% range. This is one of the
    biggest drawbacks to selling through foundries, and it\u2019s not a bad idea to
    just not allow foundries to sell OEM licenses so that you can keep all of the
    money."
