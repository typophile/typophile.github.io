body: "We see a number of thesis/dissertation fonts discussions. I have never done
  one, and am curious about the underlying assumptions, which never seem to be discussed.\r\n\r\nWho
  is the target audience? Is it a small group of professors who evaluate the thesis?
  Or every one in the design, chemistry, whatever program at the school? Or everyone
  in the world interested in that subject? Or the kind people who paid for the schooling?
  Or other? Is there a primary and secondary audience?\r\n\r\nAre we talking about
  a printed document, or a pdf document viewed on a screen, or both? If both, does
  it get re-typeset for a different medium? Are these professionally typeset or mostly
  done by the student?\r\n\r\nIs it offset printed, or professionally digital printed,
  or printed on a friend's nice printer. Is it a book, and if so how is it bound?
  Is it just a bunch of loose papers clipped together. Or in a bigger document of
  collected theses?\r\n\r\nWhy is this stuff never mentioned in the discussion? Just
  curious. Thanks."

  body: "Generally, the only person you should be concerned about pleasing is the
    person who will be assigning your grade. And, quite frankly, unless your thesis
    is about typography, your professor is likely to give a rat\u2019s ass about what
    font it\u2019s in, as long as it\u2019s readable\u2026IMHO. BTW, ditto for r\xE9sum\xE9s\u2026"

    :-)\r\n\r\nBTW, there is a large cottage industry in thesis and dissertation publishing
    - with some high prices (since most will have only a few copies made). The days
    of submitting double spaced typed 8.5x11 inch copies are over."
