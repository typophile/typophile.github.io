  body: Very well done! I&#39;m a big fan of geometric faces. <BR> <BR>Q&#39;s tail&#39;s
    a bit too small I think. Also your lowercase &#34;k&#34;&#39;s arms are a bit
    ill-proportioned. The upper curve on the figure &#34;3&#34; is a bit dissonant.
    <BR> <BR>Good luck on this one, it&#39;s beautiful.

  body: 'I think this can become a pretty solid font - the idiosyncracies &#40;like
    the &#34;f&#34;&#41; keep it from being too generic. One thing I&#39;d worry about
    though is the vertical proportions: for diagram work you might like a bigger x-height,
    although that will make it less elegant. The caps are somewhat large, but that
    might actually be a good thing for display work. <BR> <BR>In the UC, the only
    problem I see is the &#34;Q&#34;: I agree with it being non-descending, but then
    you should try having an internal part to the tail. Actually, I&#39;d change the
    &#34;I&#34; as well: for technical labeling serifs would help legibility. <BR>
    <BR>In the lc: <BR>- The &#34;a&#34; looks... dorky. Not sure how to fix it. <BR>-
    I&#39;d raise the dots on &#34;i&#34; and &#34;j&#34; &#40;except if you&#39;ll
    be pulling in the extenders&#41;. <BR>- The &#34;k&#34; isn&#39;t working. <BR>-
    The beak of the &#34;r&#34; is big, but if you keep the spacing loose &#40;since
    it&#39;s a light face&#41; it might work. <BR>- The &#34;s&#34; can have a small
    head, but I&#39;d make the whole more circular - like in Futura. <BR>- The &#34;y&#34;
    is too small. <BR>- The &#34;z&#34; is leaning right. <BR> <BR>Numerals: to me
    they seem too mannered. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Darker weights: you&#39;ll have to
    do a lot of modulation at the joins. <BR>Italics: a sensitive slanted-Roman seems

    <BR> <BR>Jon, are you creating this out of a real need for this type of font,
    or is it more of a challenging side-project? Just curious. Can&#39;t wait to see

  body: Thanks everybody! <BR> <BR>Meir, I appreciate the encouragement, and suggestions.
    <BR> <BR>Hrant, thanks for making such a detailed analysis. <BR> <BR>Addison,
    this is a &#39;challenging side project&#39; rooted in percieved need. Of course
    I hope that this can find <i>real</i> use for <i>real</i> need. The definition
    of the problem, the whys and the rules helps me get out of my own way and concentrate
    on the <i>doing</i>. I don&#39;t just want to say <i>I want to make a geometric
    sans</i> because it doesn&#39;t supply me enough traction. <BR> <BR>I am definitely
    going to re-visit &#39;Q&#39; , UC &#39;I&#39; ,&#39;k&#39; and &#39;s&#39;. The
    idea of a more circular whole for the &#39;s&#39; is useful idea and I want to
    explore that. I see the tipping &#39;z&#39; now, funny how that kind of thing
    can disappear on you. <BR> <BR>The &#39;a&#39;... well I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d
    say <b>dorky</b>, but I also don&#39;t think I am totally happy with it. I want
    to keep it two-stories though, that&#39;s for sure. I have a couple ideas I will
    explore. <BR> <BR>Hrant, if my numerals are too mannered do I fix it by encouraging
    them to be ill-mannered? :-&#41; Kidding aside, I suspect this is because when
    I was a draftsman I prided myself on my numerals. I&#39;m not sure I have an idea
    or reference point about where to go with them. Any suggestions? <BR> <BR><i>Can&#39;t
    wait to see a text sample</i> <BR> <BR>Me too.

  body: '&#62; do I fix it by encouraging them to be ill-mannered? <BR> <BR>:-&#62;
    <BR>Well, they&#39;re only mannered in the context of the alphabetics. <BR>And
    maybe &#34;mannered&#34; wasn&#39;t even the right term &#40;except for the &#34;3&#34;&#41;.
    <BR>Looking at them more carefully: <BR>- The zero is a bit eggy but I think that&#39;s
    in character. <BR>- The one and 2 are great. <BR>- The 3 needs to decide what
    number it is. <BR>- Try a bowed diagonal on the 4. <BR>- I guess the 5 is kinda
    mannered too - that point is too strong. At the least make the bar longer. <BR>-
    The 6 and 9 seem too big in the bowl. <BR>- Like the 5, the 7&#39;s point is too
    much. Plus I might pull in &#40;and maybe flatten&#41; the main stroke. <BR>-
    The 8 is squooshed. I know you don&#39;t want to make it too small though. <BR>

  body: I think Hrant and Addison have the alphabet covered, but I&#39;d definitely
    argue for oldstyle figures with this face. I love the small curves on 2 and 7,
    6 and 9 are gorgeous, and 1 is nicely accented. The slight flair on these numerals
    really ask for drop treatment IMO. Maybe concave the hypotenuse on 4 and make
    0 and 8 <i>more</i> ovoid

  body: On the exclamation point and the question mark, you may want to move the bottom
    of the stroke higher up.  That way when it&#39;s printed small, the dot won&#39;t
    morph into the stroke and cause confusion. If that makes sense...

  body: 'There are indeed pros to long descenders, and in some cases it makes great
    sense. But the &#34;limited vertical space&#34; con you mention is sort of an
    extreme manifestation of a much broader functional requirement leading to the
    need to make descenders notably shorter than ascenders in any &#34;real&#34; text
    face: <BR> <BR>Since economy is <i>always</i> a factor &#40;to some extent&#41;,
    and you need the apparent leading to be <i>just right</i> to ease &#34;linefeeds&#34;
    but without waste, optimal usage of the vertical space has a direct bearing on
    functional merit; it&#39;s not really that you want to avoid lines touching &#40;which
    can only happen with very narrow measure&#41;, it&#39;s simply that the space
    you give to the descender zone might be better used elsewhere. <BR> <BR>As you
    say though it&#39;s a matter of balance, as always. It seems to me that the pivotal
    character is the &#34;g&#34;; generally it must look <i>slightly</i> cramped for
    the balance of Cartesian usage versus overall aesthetic integrity to be good for
    text. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    name: john_todoroff
  body: Jon,  I tried to imagine what the typeface would look like in the context
    of a map or library label. All-caps settings tend to be used often &#40;for headings,
    tables, etc.&#41; and I think the uneven width of your capital letters would look
    somewhat awkward. Shrinking the W and M would help; make the narrow glyphs &#40;B,
    P, R, U, V&#41; a little wider so they&#39;ll sit nicer next to the wide round
    letters; but don&#39;t compress the round glyphs or you&#39;ll kill the geometric
    quality. The R needs work -- it looks like a B with the bottom chopped off, and
    a straight leg would suit your intent better. <BR> <BR>The number 1 should have
    a wider &#34;beak,&#34; &#40;and maybe a &#34;foot&#34;&#41; for the same reasons.
    <BR> <BR>I like Avenir but it&#39;s been getting overused, so I&#39;m interested
    to see where you take this. I think there is a niche for a font that has the &#34;flavor&#34;
    of Avenir but is tailored for a certain function. &#40;Hmm, I wonder, what&#39;s
    the flavor of Avenir... does it taste like Cool Mint Listerine, chewable vitamin
    C tablets, a raspberry Stoli &amp; soda?&#41; <BR> <BR>//john

  body: John, Thanks for your input. Perfectly timed as I revisit the many aspects
    of this project. It is very true that all caps is common in labelling on maps
    and in libraries, and your advice makes a great deal of sense in this respect.
    <BR> <BR>When I drew the glyphs it was of great concern to me that I not end up
    with another Futura. I like Avenir a lot, and was making decisions on some of
    the glyphs like &#39;f&#39; and &#39;R&#39; to intenionally diverge from the path.
    <BR> <BR>Your suggestions strike a chord with me and I will give them serious
    thought. <BR> <BR>To my thinking Avenir = Cool Mint Listerine &#40;minty with
    a little hint of medicine&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: "Well I finally carved out some time to return to this.\r\n\r\nI have redrawn
    many of the letters, incorporating many of the suggestions here (an improvement
    for sure). Here's the deal:\r\n- Narrowed the 'W' and 'M'\r\n- redrew the 's'
    which is more geometric now, but I'm afraid is too narrow\r\n- Just noticed that
    the uc 'S' needs to be redrawn too, especially its tail.\r\n- terminated the hook
    in the 'J' and 'j' earlier and they look nicer now.\r\n- K as noted in an earlier
    post\r\n- uc 'i' has bars on it but I got scared and they look knobby. Same with
    'J'.\r\n- lc 'a' is now a single storey (sigh) which works better.\r\n- 'Q' has
    a new tail.\r\n- lc 'L' stroke too thick and 'X' strokes too thin.\r\n- also redrew
    the lc 'y' and shortened its extender.\r\n\r\nI took the drawings into TypeTool
    and generated this font. The sample was made with the newly generated font in
    Illustrator and converted to outlines for the PDF so I didn't run into any weirdness.
    I did some ignorant kerning and spacing but I have never used a font editor before
    so this is obviously crude. No punctuation or numerals have been revised since
    the earlier drawings and are not in the font at this time.\r\n\r\nAre W and M
    narrow enough now? Should I straighten the leg of the R? Please comment on anything
    as you see fit.\r\n\r\nDownload the <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/jon_whipple/pdfs/20060105_KompassSample.pdf\">20060105_KompassSample.pdf</a>.\r\n\r\nA

    problem. Iaadmit that the single storey a is much more pedestrian but may be more
    useful in the intended application of labelling etc.. I think the s is improved

  body: You are correct, and I actually think it's more of a utility thing! When I
    saw your initial post, I thought to myself, "Excellent, someone has <em>fixed</em>
    the <em>legibility problem</em> common to many geometric sans." <em>Especially</em>
    for labelling. Whether at small screen sizes, small print with ink gain, lacking
    one's reading glasses, or just from glancing at it too fast, there is a huge potential
    for 'a'/'o' confusion. If the tiny words in your gif were out of context, on a
    map, for instance, I honestly wouldn't know if I were looking at 'Rambas Tocos'
    or what.
