body: "I'm looking for a font that will be able to translate some text my sensei sent
  me. I'm trying to design a card for him but for the life of me can not find a decent
  Japanese font for it (with Kanji, found a few kana ones). I think I might need unicode
  ?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wazu.jp/gallery/samples/AoyagiKouzanFont2OTF__Japanese.gif\r\nlooks
  awesome. but doesn't seem to work on my computer. I've installed for 20 and none
  seem to translate well, which makes me think I need unicode version?\r\n\r\nfound
  it here http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Japanese.html\r\n\r\nI need to use this
  text:\r\n\u5C71\u4E0B\u6B66\u9053\u3053\u304F\u3055\u3044\u304D\u3087\u304B\u3044\r\n\r\nand
  help/direction would be amazing."

  body: If you have any of our CS5 applications, one of the DVDs should include the
    Kozuka Mincho and Kozuka Gothic typefaces, all six weights of each can easily
    render that text.

  body: Our [[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=KOZK10005000|Kazuraki]]
    font is quite fluid, and includes glyphs for all of the characters in the string
    you referenced.

    of your text has a typo, specifically that it is missing a character, and can
    also be rendered using the appropriate kanji. Click [[http://lundestudio.com/photos/kazuraki-sample.jpg|here]]
    for three renderings of your text, using Kazuraki. The first line is your text
    as-is. The second line is with the missing character added. The third line is
    your text with the hiragana rendered using the appropriate kanji."

    [[http://lundestudio.com/photos/kazuraki-sample-vert.jpg|here]] for the same text,
    but in vertical layout.

  body: "oh wow that is beautiful! I stand corrected. I will have to talk to my sensei
    about the typo. it seems I did not actually try these fonts, they were fonts that
    sounded close to it. Didn't even realize they were on the DVD!\r\n\r\nthank much,
    you saved me a headache and a half."

  body: Wow, that Aoyagi font really is beautiful. What problems did you have with
    it? I installed it and it seems to work fine for me. Thanks for pointing it out.

  body: "oh, is there any way I can get that in plain text, or is this even possible?
    I want to send it via text he's not that great with email :)\r\n\r\napetickler:
    I installed it on OSX, then I pasted the text above, when I pasted the text into
    illustrator, it would just skip to another font, like it didn't exist. HOWEVER,
    I just tried it again but in Photoshop, and it seems to work? Very strange."

  body: "Here is the correct string in plain text: \u5C71\u4E0B\u6B66\u9053\u3053\u304F\u3055\u3044\u304D\u3087\u3046\u304B\u3044
    (a \"\u3046\" was missing).\r\n\r\nHere is the version that substitutes the kana
    with the appropriate kanji: \u5C71\u4E0B\u6B66\u9053\u56FD\u969B\u6559\u4F1A.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    Kazuraki is not included on the CS5 DVDs, but is available on our Type Showroom
    for a very reasonable price of $35 (I provided the link in an earlier post to
    this thread). This font includes glyphs for all kana and 1,483 kanji. It is also
    fully proportional."
