  out in previous ID threads was digitized in the 90s(and quite poorly at that).\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  would like to know the name of the typeface for the subtitles, this is often found
  in dada documents,\r\n\r\nThe words are:\r\nKatalog, Banalitaten, Nasci\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/merz_nasci_6314.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks
  for all the suggestions. Helpful as always :) "

    Block</a> to me. I wonder if it is that. BANALIT\xC4TEN looks like something else
    (the \"B\" doesn't match, and check the \"E\")."

  body: "Yep, Nina is spot on with Block. The minor differences are due to the fact
    that this is metal, of course, and hence not necessarily consistent in the details
    across various sizes. Also, Block offered a wide range of width alternates.\r\n\u2018Banalit\xE4ten\u2019
    is another Berthold face, Berliner. You can get very close with the digital <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/berliner-grotesk-bq/\">Berliner Grotesk</a>,
    by [[Erik Spiekermann]]."

    should then be Block again, right?"
