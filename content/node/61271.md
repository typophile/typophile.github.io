    with, but just having a tiny subset of glyphs makes the whole thing kinda pointless.
    OK, so it's free, but still, who's going to work with copy (signage or otherwise)
    that contains just those letters?\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver

    with the letters in that sign I don\u2019t think Flaminia looks anything like
    Aptifer.\r\n\r\nI was thinking this typeface was more on the order of Zemerstro:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/zemestro/\r\n\r\nExcept
    that Zemestro is a complete design and this is not.\r\n\r\nWell, interesting concept
    tho... but too bad for not having an ACTUAL ALPHABET!!!\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: Damn. I've been hunting around the Internet for the past hour or so trying
    to find an OpenType version of this font... such a shame one doesn't exist. Even
    bigger shame that it only contains a few characters. I really had a use for a
    font like this, too!

  body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI am the designer of Flaminia OS. Sexy? Thank you SuperUltraFabulous.
    :)\r\n\r\nFlaminia is a typographic system that allows its users to test the readability
    of fonts that can be used in wayfinding projects. It is a system not yet fully
    usable for writing (it was started as an experimental thesis), and its aim was
    to create a very fluid system that could have variables added and removed in order
    to always be an up to date research instrument. Although its glyphs are not all
    completed yet, the multiple masters and the variables I dedcided to take into
    consideration are already all present, and the .vfb files provided allowed the
    design of the signs pictured above.\r\n\r\nMr Puckett, how exactly does Flaminia
    OS remind you of Aptifer? The design of Flaminia is all explained in the research
    book readable on my website and the shape of the glyphs designed derives from
    a research of the characteristics of the most common typefaces used in signage.
    Being a multiple master system, Flaminia has many shapes that can be combined,
    and the instances I decided to extrapolate and print on the signs are only a few.\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    whoever would like to contribute to the project is very welcome, I understand
    the limits of an uncomplete system like Flaminia, but really believe that a global
    effort could result in a very interesting and useful tool.\r\n\r\nCheers from
    Italy,\r\na.  "
