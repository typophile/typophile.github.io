body: "Hello everyone.\r\n\r\nI'm making a PHP application to generate text labels.
  The PHP libraries seem to don't support OpenType features.\r\nNow I have no problem
  working with unicode index to display the standard characters.\r\nBut, as far as
  I know, the OpenType features are name based.\r\nFor example: if I want to display
  a ligature \xABmy\xBB I have to replace \xABm\xBB and \xABy\xBB unicodes indexes
  by \xABmy\xBB unicode index.\r\nThe problem now is I don't have unicode indexes
  on this characters and I can't reffer to them by their names.\r\n\r\nThe questions
  are:\r\n\r\nIs there any existing unicode for these glyphs and I am missing them?\r\nDo
  I need to reencode all the glyphs?\r\nWhich is the best way to reencode a font and/or
  generate unicode names for this purposes?\r\nIs there any standard?\r\n\r\nI also
  noted, when I reencode an existing font with many glyphs and generate a new version
  the file size increases almost ten times.\r\n\r\nYour help and contributions will
  be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you can assign unicode numbers to your special characters in the Private Use area.
    However, you should be aware that some folks have already staked out niches in
    that territory...\r\n\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=VendorUseOfPUA\r\n\r\nbut
    you ought to be able to find some unclaimed slots to code your characters so your
    script will work."

  body: If you generate images, Nick's suggestion is good. If you want to create selectable,
    searchable, degradeable text you might want to do some javascript thing similar
    to what I'm working on at the moment. PM me if you're interested.

  body: "Nick: \r\n\r\nActually what i'm trying to do is to get the special characters
    unicode for any font. Because it depends on the encoding of the font I'm trying
    to figure out the more quick and simple method to do it.\r\nFor example, I want
    to use a font with ligatures and stylistic alternates for image generation. I'm
    not sure if there is a way to reffer to the unicode from scratch, i think it strictly
    depends on how the unicodes were asigned to this font. If there is no unicode
    for the special characters (ligatures, alternates, small caps, etc), how should
    I reencode / reassign the unicode numbers in Fontlab avoiding doing it one by
    one? Is there any way to assign them in one movement?\r\n\r\nI tried to generate
    Unicode for a few fonts with many special characters. I realized if I use a standard
    table it seems to work, but many special characters are missing and it repeats
    one of the characters many times in a weird way.\r\n\r\nLast week I could reencode
    one of this fonts and it worked ok, with unicodes for every glyph and it worked
    ok. For some reason I have no idea what I did then and I can't repeat the same
    process. I thought I generated unicode with a Standard Table, but now i'm trying
    to do it again and it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nAlso, and for now, i really don't care
    which unicodes I have in each special character, because it is for personal and
    private use and I don't need to distribute the font. I'm only worried to make
    it work in my image generator.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank: \r\n\r\nFor now, what i'm trying
    to do is to generate images. Are you working on something similar to Cufon or
    SIFR?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "<em>How to assign Private User Area unicodes to all the swashes, alternates
    and ligatures?</em>\r\n\r\nHere's what I did; I'm not sure that it's the approved
    method, but it has worked for me so far.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Program Files &gt;
    Common Files &gt; FontLab &gt; Mapping</strong>, I opened the file <strong>standard.nam</strong>
    in NotePad+ and saved it as <strong>standard_old.nam</strong>. I then made a few
    changes to the file, following this format...\r\n\r\n<code>0xF### glyphname</code>\r\n\r\nthen
    saved the file as <strong>standard.nam</strong>.\r\n\r\nThen, in FontLab, I made
    sure that under <strong>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Unicode and OpenType &gt; Default
    Unicode-Name mapping table</strong>, I selected <strong>Standard Table</strong>.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    in order to generate my new \"standard\" Unicode, after I have composed all my
    glyphs and named them according to MY standard, I select <strong> Glyph &gt; Glyph
    Names &gt; Generate Unicode</strong>. Finally, just for good housekeeping, I select
    Index Mode, Select All glyphs, sort them by Unicode, then select Charmap View.\r\n\r\nAs
    I said, I don't know if this method is kosher/halal, but it works for me,"

  body: "I made an experiment:\r\n\r\nI created a Robofab script that assign an unicode
    to every character without unicode index.\r\nIt checks every glyph, if it doesn't
    have unicode the script will assign a new PUA value, starting from E000 (57344)
    and increasing by one for every glyph.\r\nI generated an Opentype/PS version and
    it works with my image generator.\r\nI'm not sure if this is extremely unortodox
    or if it will take me to new problems.\r\nI tried it and it works. I assume there
    is no problem with these unicodes until I try to use it in other systems.\r\n\r\nNick:
    Thank you for your solution for the Standard Table edition. I didn't try it yet.\r\nAlso,
    if you want the script I made, just let me know."

    Once I do it it seems to work when I reencode and generate unicode, it adds PUA

    the fonts you generate using it...
