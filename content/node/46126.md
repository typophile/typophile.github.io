  body: "Um. I'm not sure it's officially called the White House seal, but assuming
    you're referring to the [[http://media.npr.org/blogs/talk/whitehouse.jpg|blue
    plaque]] that hangs behind the lectern in the WH press center and appears on the
    banner at [[http://www.whitehouse.gov/index.html|whitehouse.gov]], the font on
    the plaque and the seal are not exactly the same -- the capital W, if nothing
    else.\r\n\r\n"
