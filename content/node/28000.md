  body: fine and all, but these are _very_ similar. I'm looking for FRESH alternatives.
    I don't want people thinking "Is that Helvetica?"

  body: "It depends which qualities of Helvetica you are considering as definitive.\r\n\r\nFor
    Preface, I kept the grotesque curve shape, angle of stress, and contrast, but
    changed many of the letterforms -- producing a different colour/rhythm.\r\n\r\nSo
    on the \"curve\" basis I would discount Proxima (too round) and Galaxie (too square),
    and their letterforms are also quite orthodox. \r\n\r\nKnockout 31 makes an interesting
    comparison with Helvetica Regular, as does Maple -- they are both very \"19th
    century grotesques\". Going in the other direction, of minimizing the idiosyncracies
    of letterform, you end up with Frutiger.\r\n\r\nParalucent is a grotesque with
    a couple of novel letterforms, and some interesting details.\r\n\r\nChalet is
    interesting, but it would require taking the \"a\" from 1960 (IMO the a is the
    quintessential LC Helvetica character) and putting it in 1980.\r\n"
