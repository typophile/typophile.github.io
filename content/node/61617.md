body: "I'm running into a problem with the way in which FontLab Studio orders GSUB
  features, and I suspect it is because I don't really understand how GSUB lookups
  are actually implemented. I've got some features which rely on lookups which are
  defined in other feature definitions, and FontLab isn't ordering those features
  the way in which they appear in the OpenType window. The general structure of the
  relevant portion is as follows:\r\n\r\nfeature fea1 {\r\n\t\_\_\_\_lookup A { ...
  } A ;\r\n\t\_\_\_\_lookup B { ... } B ;\r\n} fea1 ;\r\n\r\nfeature fea2 {\r\n\r\n\t\_\_\_\_lookup
  B ;\r\n\t\_\_\_\_lookup C { ... } C ;\r\n\t\_\_\_\_lookup D { ... } D;\r\n  \r\n}
  fea2 ;\r\n\r\nfeature fea3 {\r\n\r\n\_\_\t\_\_lookup B ;\r\n\_\_\t\_\_lookup E {
  ... } E ;\r\n\_\_\t\_\_lookup D ;\r\n  \r\n} fea3 ;\r\n\r\nfeature fea4 {\r\n\r\n\t\_\_\_\_lookup
  B ;\r\n\t\_\_\_\_lookup F { ... } F ;\r\n\t\_\_\_\_lookup E;\r\n\t\_\_\_\_lookup
  C ;\r\n\t\_\_\_\_lookup D;\r\n  \r\n} fea4 ;\r\n\r\nThe problem which I am running
  into is that FLS is determined to place feature 'fea2' after 'fea4' despite the
  order in which I've placed them. I'm assuming that this has something to do with
  the fact that lookups are being called across features, but I don't understand why
  I can call features defined in 'fea1' and 'fea3' in 'fea4' and have them ordered
  as I've requested, while 'fea2' is bumped to the end. All of the lookups involved
  are contextual substitution rules (GSUB type 6) except for lookup A which is GSUB
  type 1.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to simply redefine each of the lookups in
  each of the feature blocks, but this seems rather inefficient. Can someone give
  me some pointers on where I can get an explanation of what's going on here? If there's
  something in the FSL manual or in Adobe's OT spec I seem to be missing it.\r\n\r\nTIA,\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Andr\xE9, \r\n\r\nthe feature definition syntax used in the Adobe FDK for
    OpenType (AFDKO) library version 1.6, which is used by FontLab Studio 5, allows
    you to specify lookups inside of the feature definition clauses. Yet in the OpenType
    Layout tables, lookups are stored in a sequence, and then are mapped to the features,
    which are not ordered in any way. So by defining the lookups inside of feature
    descriptions, what you actually do is you define the order of lookups. \r\n\r\nBut
    also note that when FontLab Studio opens an existing OpenType font, it decompiles
    the features code into the AFDKO syntax, and sometimes does not give you a perfect
    representation of what is inside of the font file. I recommend using a tool such
    as FontTools/TTX or -- especially -- DTL OTMaster to look at how the lookups are
    ordered inside of the final font file. This will give you a reliable insight into
    the actual font structure. \r\n\r\nThe case you're describing is strange. I suggest
    reporting a problem directly at http://www.fontlab.com/problem\r\n\r\nThe AFDKO
    version 2.x syntax allows to define lookups outside of feature definitions, so
    you have perfect control over the lookup order, and can even do things like interweaving
    lookups (so when two features are applied at the same time, the 1st lookup of
    the 1st feature can be applied, then the 1st lookup of the 2nd feature, then the
    2nd lookup of the 1st feature, then the 2nd lookup of the 2nd feature). \r\n\r\nFontLab
    Studio does not yet use AFDKO 2.x. So if you need this functionality, you need
    to build your OpenType font using the makeotf tool that ships with AFDKO 2.5.

  body: "Adam,\r\n\r\nThanks for your detailed reply -- this does clarify things quite
    a bit and I suspect I now understand where the problem lies. I've been thinking
    about the cross-feature lookup calls in the same way as I think of procedure calls
    which is apparently not a good metaphor. Your response makes it clear that I'll
    simply have to duplicate the lookups in each feature since what I was trying to
    do was essentially alter the order in which lookup C, D, and E were applied in
    the different features.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
