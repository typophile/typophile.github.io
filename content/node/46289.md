    useful than the one before. Second, I never go by the name of the designer alone,
    I always look. I've found two errors in the specimens that are being published,
    (never, ever, track or let ultra open via justification), and those will be corrected
    this week. I don't think there is anything amiss in the well-drawn department,
    but considering all the things I've said in my life about various versions of
    you-know-what-ica, I'm always interested in a Swiss point of view. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "I think it is a fair observation that this version does vary in feeling from
    the original to such an extent that the voice, feeling or sensibility of the font
    can be regarded as definitely changed. This might be what be what Tiff meant by
    \"<cite>with an industrial blower</cite>\". I can only assume this was David's
    intention. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong BTW! The clearest sense of the
    change would probably come from looking at an ATF book and then at the FB material.
    \r\n\r\nI hold the metal franklin gothic in very deep esteem* so I admit it's
    is a bit disconcerting to see this new one. I'll have to let you know in time
    if I still cling to my sacred cow or not. If you asked me today I would probably
    have to cling.\r\n\r\nIn any event, if what you want is a fairly pure continuity
    with the old metal face but with more weights etc; then this release is probably
    not what you are looking for. But then that's not everybody...\r\n\r\nCeratinly
    if ITC wants to name it \"Franklin Gothic\" then I think that's their right. \r\n\r\nAnd
    if you would have preferred it otherwise I suppose it's your right to complain.\r\n\r\n*
    Maybe too deep. On the positive side though I can definitely say that pondering
    the mystery of why FG looked so very fine to me was one of the first steps I took
    on the road to designing type."

    clear decision was made not to call it Franklin Gothic, because it was felt, as
    observed here, that it isn't. If one thinks Franklin, is too close a name, I'm
    not going to argue. On the other hand, it is not in fact, ATF Franklin Gothic
    in format, face or name, so I'm not sure if there is a question.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
