  like line tops are clipped in the Page View, it looks OK in Normal View, and it
  prints fine. What is more, my font is not the only one, huh :|\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clipping_4923.png]\r\nMost
  other fonts (TNR, Helvetica, etc.) do not share this problem.\r\nWhat is going on,
  please?"
