  or (more likely) [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheltenham_%28typeface%29|Cheltenham]],
  but I haven't been able to locate a version of either of these fonts that matches
  the samples I've seen \"exactly\" (although the version used in the type specimen
  on the Cheltenham Wikipedia page seems quite close).\r\n\r\nHere's a sample (from
  an ad for a lawn tractor):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Example of font

  answers) would be appreciated."
