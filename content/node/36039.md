  mine.  I started it a few years ago as a hybrid between blackletter and roman, before
  I knew anything about blackletter.  The revision has ligatures, alternate characters,
  upper and lowercase numerals, small caps, Cyrillic and Greek alphabets, and the
  kerning and metrics have been fixed. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. Should
  I keep working on it?  I'm especially interested in feedback from people familiar
  with blackletter typography. \r\n\r\n-matt\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample2_1.png]"

    a less sharp angle... unfortunately the whole font is made around that angle,
    so it'll be a lot of work.  But if it looks better, it's worth it.  :)\r\n\r\n-matt"

  body: "I want to encourage you not to treat it as a mechanistic job. EG - don't
    assume that the same angle works best for all the letters. On one maybe it stays
    the same on another maybe you move it 20 points down on another 22 on a yet another
    5 etc. \r\n\r\nThe variation may give you a richer more interesting feeling, and
    you may be able to make better letters that way too.\r\n\r\nFor instance my guess
    is that the i could maybe stay the same whereas the r will benefit from a lower
    angle.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I saw was that the lc s looks a little thin compared
    to the other glyphs. Maybe the middle can be fatter."

  body: It seems better to me. What about a cut a ball terminal on the lc r? also
    a Think I would begin the connextion further down on the stroke. I think the lc
    g could have a more complex/weighty ear. I would jet the j descend further before
    making the slash cut. The lc z is strangely wide compared to it's fellow letters.
    What if you let some letters like the q have the slash angle in the opposite direction?
    Can you see why I would think of that?

    think you were right about the j... I've pulled it down, along with a number of
    other characters. I made the z narrower too.\r\n\r\n@mr: I've fixed the Xi. \r\n\r\nThanks

    the second is the same ball terminal from the 'c' and 'e', the third is a squished

  body: I encourage you too keep tweaking & trying new things with that such as making
    the angle of the cut on the ball not match the cut on the stem by even more &
    maybe in the other direction too. A cut ball might look nice on the lc s as well.
    What about lowering the pint at which the arm of the come out from the stem?

  body: "It's little details like the top of the arm of the r. At smal sizes you might
    not notice but big you can see that the curve is lumpy. The bottom of the e and
    it's end need a little more weight. The aldine style diagonal on the echoed in
    the s is a different angle from the diagonal cut of the descenders. I wonder if
    it would be good to reduce it in the descenders to that of the s & e. The s falls
    over backwards. It needs a wider base. I wonder if the r would benefit from starting
    the crotch of the r deeper down. What if the s had it's terminals out just a little
    more so the end s might be heavier? What about lettering the ascenders be a little
    taller? I think that might make the face read better & help make the teeth at
    the bottom less of an impediment to reading. The bottom of the d seems like a
    make do solution. In general it is the joins on the letters that need the most
    help. Look at Cooper Black and maybe the bold weight of DTL Fleischmann, and Freight.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Fleischmann_rdrct.html\r\n\r\n(pull
    the the weight\r\n\r\nhttp://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freighttext.php\r\n\r\n
    I might comment further but I don't have a full glyph set with the cut-ball terminals.\r\n\r\nOn
    some level it's a spit & polish thing. Are all the details the way you want them?
    Obviously you don't have to do any of this. You may decide that I am mistaken
    which is quite possible. Or that it's good enough. But what I like about the face
    is that it's outrageous but it nearly works - very well. I see potential. The
    ball terminal for instance work better than I thought - even. I would hate to
    see it be less than it can be. If you are sick of it maybe put it away & come
    back... But that's just my 2.5 cents.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?  "
