  body: "There are at least four, and possibly as many as six different typefaces
    used in that image.\r\n\r\nThe large \"BILLION\" might be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/poster-sans/bold/|Poster
    Sans Bold]].\r\n\r\n\"ONEBILLIONRISING\" might be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-twentieth-century/|TwentiethCenturyMedium]]
    or a number of others. Not much unique there.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any font
    with that particular 'R' in the vertical \"RISING\", which is likely a condensed
    variety. \r\n\r\nThe resolution makes it difficult to determine if \"FEBRUARY\"
    and \"STRIKE DANCE RISE!\" are in the same face, but not condensed, as the vertical
    \"RISING\".\r\n\r\nThe numbers and the \"V\" in the flower could be from different
    faces again.\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"1 BILLION\": no match but (more) very close, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/cst-berlin/|Cst
    Berlin East Bold]] (/N looks off), [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100002|Champion
    Gothic]] (very close but /1 is off too and not rounded) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/garage-gothic/|Garage
    Gothic Bold]] (squooshed but /1 is off). Something's bothering me though, the
    apparent slight irregularity of outlines, may be the result of post-treatment
    like emboldening/rounding treatment? May be starting with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/49-light-ultra-condensed/|Univers
    Ultra Condensed Light]] or  [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100002|Champion
    Gothic]] and emboldening and rounding it could do the trick...\r\n\"14 2013\":
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/49-light-ultra-condensed/|Univers
    Ultra Condensed Light]]\r\n\"ONEBILLIONRISING.ORG\": most probably [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/|Avant-Garde
    Gothic]]\r\n\"FEBRUARY\", \"STRIKE DANCE RISE\": could also be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/com-59-ultra-condensed/|Univers
    Ultra Condensed]]\r\n\"RISING\": close are [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013|Knockout]]
    and [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100002|Champion
    Gothic]] (the closest I guess)"
