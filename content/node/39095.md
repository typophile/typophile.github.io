  body: "Indeed. ScanFont 5 works great with FontLab Studio 5.0.3/5.0.4, or TypeTool
    3.0.0, and it's a really major upgrade for Windows (since ScanFont 4 only existed
    on the Mac). \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "The demo wouldn't talk to my FontLab Studio 5.0.4 install at all. Is that
    a restriction in the demo version?\r\n\r\nScanFont 3 allowed you to save out a
    working font file didn't it? Taking that feature out could be considered a bit
    of a downgrade."

  body: "Is it Windows or Mac problem? If it is on Windows, please, reboot, then run
    FLS, then run ScanFont 5 and try to export the font. Let me know if it works or
    not.\r\n\r\nScanFont can save VFB (format supported by FontLab Studio or TypeTool)
    if there is a problem with live communication. You can turn it on in Tools > Options
    > Outline font editor. "

  body: "SparkyType, \r\n\r\nScanFont 3 was $198. ScanFont 5 is $99 and it can plug
    into TypeTool 3 (also $99). So the bundle costs the same as ScanFont 5 alone (hence
    no downgrade at all), and TypeTool 3 is much more of a full-blown font editor
    than the crippled ScanFont 3 font editing part. Instead of TypeTool 3, you can
    use FontLab Studio 5. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Also, for users who have problems running ScanFont together with FontLab
    Studio or TypeTool -- in ScanFont's preferences, in the Outline Font Editor section,
    choose \"Export outline font into VFB file\".  You will then be able to save the
    ScanFont output into a .VFB file that you can open in FontLab Studio or TypeTool
    using conventional means (File / Open). \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Hi Yuri\r\n\r\nI had that problem with the Windows version. After rebooting
    and loading FontLab Studio first I still got the same error (something like 'Unable
    to connect to FontLab server').\r\n\r\nThanks for the .VFB exporting tip. I'll
    download the demo again and have another crack at it."
