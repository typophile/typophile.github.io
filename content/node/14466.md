  of them, and my designer is threatening hari-kari.\r\n\r\nHere's what we are working

  why he's ready to commit hari-kari?\r\n\r\nWell I like #15 on series 4, as well
  as 8,12,16 from the same set.  \r\nBut none of them make me think 'hey, lets draft
  up the site, the cards, and the letter head now' \r\nI'd appreciate any and all
  feedback.\r\n\r\n-Matt"

    doesn't have a concept to work on.\r\n\r\nGive your designer more input on the

  body: Hector, is right, these are good examples of design for design sake. Questions
    I have are who is your target audience, what are you trying to sell (hosting?,
    design?), What does hidef mean? Even IBM was International Business Machines before
    it became IBM. You need not just a mark but spell out your name and create a positioning
    line (even if you don't use it with the logo). This isn't a logo project its a
    CI (Corporate Idenity) project and takes a lot more work than just torturing your
    designer.

  body: "Is it hidef as in high definition? If so, I think you need to split the word:
    hi-def, as 'hidef' just looks a little odd (hedef? hide f? hid def? I also think
    the variations where 'web' is on a separate line work much better.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the options, it looks like the shotgun approach. You need to start narrowing things
    down. Personally, I like the simplicity of series 3."

  body: "Our audience: 100k/yr-20m/yr businesses.  Web design, hosting, consultation,
    custom programming, software development, some IT, and some print design.  We've
    had the name for 3 years and it would be tricky to change at this point, we are
    just hitting a big growth spurt right now and we want to get our brand up to that.\r\n\r\nOur
    designer is a gifted and wonderful fellow, and we treat him well.  I was trying
    to steer more toward a text based logo rather than merely a brand mark.  I think
    that would allow for greater growth, and a more serious look.  I've told him this,
    though we disagree some.\r\n\r\nWe are doing identity, we have the colors picked
    out, we are narrowing down fonts (this will depend partly on the logo), and we
    are getting ideas for cards and everything else.  We are just trying to stick
    a logo to use as the basis for what is to come.  He knows it's a helluva project,
    as do we.\r\n\r\nWe've gone from more marked logos to more text logos, so we are
    certainly going in a direction, but I am trying to guide it to something I like.\r\n\r\nAluminum,
    I like your thoughts about splitting it up.... except our company name is \"hidef
    web solutions llc\" so I think legality might bind us a bit.  And (not sure if
    I can post this) www.hidefweb.com is our domain.  Of course if I were to name
    it it would be the core members last names, or conflict design (since my business
    partner is Iranian and I am Jewish)."

    without substantive reason.\r\n\r\nDoes your designer know you're posting his
    work here? He might be interested to read this stuff directly/defend his decisions/benefit
    from the idea exchange."

  body: Personally, I feel that any of the choices in the very first link you provided
    will fill your need for a strong, text-based logo. All are simple, clean and direct.
    My favorite in that series is 3rd from the bottom. The font fits well within the
    web development community. It's modern and technical...without looking geeky.
    :) It's been said before, but I also feel that it is a matter of personal preference.
    Just find the right color combo and you are all set.

    shape which contains the name.\r\n\r\n2.) Visual treatment done to the \"e\".\r\n\r\nI
    would advise you to pick one and stick to it.  To use both\r\nis conceptually
    confusing and visually competitive within itself.\r\n\r\nLastly, I ask what is
    the concept behind that semi-geometric shape?\r\nIt looks akin to a trend... "

    now...not complimenting. Pick one and go with ti.\r\n\r\nI like the 'e' but I'd
    stay away from the 3-d sphere logo as that's very stereotypical of the dot-com
    bubble/crash era.\r\n\r\nThe only issue I have with the shape (and I'm admittedly
    REALLY stretching here...) is that it looks like a lemon. Lemon is usually a bad
    connotation unless you are selling lemonade. "

  body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nSorry to be negative, but I think Aluminium's nailed it...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.e3direktiv.com
    are a .com, web agency. It's v. similar.\r\n\r\nI actually like the lemon shape
    but I'm unsure of the reasoning for it, it looks a bit like a stylised leaf to
    me. Nothing really seems to say 'high-definition' - I'm assuming that's what Hi-Def
    stands for. Maybe something along the lines of clarity, quality, sharpness, high-end,
    upmarket - these are all adjectives that might associate well with High Definition.
    Conceptualise the brand first. Dress it up second... it's just an exercise in
    style otherwise. If you revist that, you'll give yourself the chance to hit on
    a concept that can then permeate everything associated with your brand - i.e.
    web, brochures etc., which will aid brand recognition and give it a cohesive look.
    Just as long as you've got a clear idea propping it all up, it'll be fine.\r\n\r\nMy
    tip would be to switch off your Apple Mac and logically work out your ideas on
    paper first. Logos that aren't great look better when they've been through Adobe
    Illustrator, so finding the one/s that work is a bit trickier if you're just making
    everything look slick - it's easy to convince yourself that a logo works because
    it looks slick.\r\n\r\nSorry if it's all negative sounding, it wasn't meant to
    be. I'm trying to back up any criticism with constructive comment - it wouldn't
    be a critique otherwise.\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: 'What bothers me a little about all of the designs is that they seem to be
    focusing more on image/trendiness and less on communicating what this company
    is about. It seems to me that these designs would be just as well suited for a
    clothing line as a dot com. What''s your company''s unique trait that you''d like
    to convey? Customer service? Quality work? Defining this will help you make a
    selection. If anything, HiDef, as in high-definition, suggests top-of-the-line.
    Your previous logo separated the words more, using upper and lowercase to break
    them into understandable chunks, I think this was a good start. All lowercase
    letters, as in your current iteration, doesn''t do much to communicate the concept. '
