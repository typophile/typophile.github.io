  designed Salvo Sans & Salvo Serif (originally called Boomer Sans & Boomer Serif)
  as one series to tie the design of <em>AARP The Magazine</em> to <em>AARP The Bulletin</em>
  and <em>AARP Segunda Juventud</em>. Together the Salvos illustrate the guiding sentiments
  of the design director Courtney Murphy, \u201CHopeful, informative, alive, embracing
  and delightful. The right words draw people in, but on a subconscious level the
  typeface does that first.\u201D FB 2007, 2011\r\n\r\n\r\n30 styles each: Light,
  Regular, Medium, Bold, and Black, all with Italics, in Normal, Condensed, and Extra
  Condensed Widths\r\n\r\nSalvo Sans & Salvo Serif are available as OpenType fonts
  with both proportional and tabular figures plus arbitrary fractions."
