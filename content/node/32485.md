  is intimidating.\r\n\r\nI'm having a problem with the way Trade Gothic Oblique is
  printing from PDFs I create in InDesign CS. The Oblique is getting an extra slant,
  but only when I print from the PDF. The extra slant is not visible in the PDF on
  screen. It does not have the extra slant when I print directly from the ID file
  to my Epson 4000 (non-Postscript). When I set the Oblique in a Quark 6 doc and create
  a PDF file, it prints fine. It seems to be a problem only with the PDFs created
  in ID.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea how to fix this problem? Thanks in advance."

    is attached now. I should have changed the name from Italics to Oblique, but this
    was just a test file."

    screen.

    body: Miguel, does it look like it's properly slanted? Or too slanted? I wonder
      why my Epson is interpreting that PDF so strangely... the Oblique type is angled
      way too much on my print-out. Thank you for letting me know how it printed out
      for you.

  body: "I suspect is is something to do with fonts that were originally style-linked
    in suitcases, which is the way things were done in the good old days before OS
    X.\r\nPerhaps new versions of Acrobat do not recognize the suitcase, within which
    linking was required to cause italicization to happen.\r\nBut now, the italicization
    happens due to other font information, however Acrobat thinks that it hasn't happened,
    so applies a mechanical slant as well.\r\nSame thing for bold...\r\nJust a theory.\r\n"
