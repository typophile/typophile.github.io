body: "I am using [[Adam Twardoch]]'s rename [[glyph]] macro to change glyph names.
  It does a great job with the glyphs but it does not change any references to the
  glyphs in the [[OpenType|OT]] features.\r\n\r\nIs there a macro that will do that?
  I want to design my fonts and features with easily understandable names, and then
  convert them to the unixxxx format in the final stage only."

  body: There isn't a python script for FontLab that does this, as far as I know (I'd
    love to be corrected). Instead, I would suggest having a feature and class file
    for development, and a feature and class file for production. It may be a pain
    to set up the first time, but it would be something that you would only have to
    do once. Feature and classes do not need to be built inside of FontLab, any text
    editor (or Excel) will do. Once you build the two sets, you just import them in
    the class pane and features pane in FontLab. When it's time for production, run
    Adam's macro to change the glyph names and then load in the production versions
    of your class and feature files.
