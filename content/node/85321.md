  to create UFO files? I'm aware of Area51, but that only seems to convert UFO to
  OTF, not the other way round.\r\n\r\nI've run into some problems with the RoboFab
  UFO macro in FontLab (partial UFO created, script gags on a particular glyph, does
  not continue), which I've written to Erik about. And Glyphs seems to mess up the
  glyph order in the UFO, which is not the end of the world for my current needs,
  but is unnerving.\r\n\r\nWhat other options are there for creating UFOs?"

    managed to get Glyphs to export one imported OTF as a UFO. It messed up the glyph
    order apparently, but it will load in UFOstretch. But Glyphs gags on the other
    OTF: it becomes unresponsive and I have to force close it eventually."

    export to work perfectly.\r\n\r\nRestoring the /con/ glyph and changing its name
    to /uniA76F/ also enables UFO Central to export properly.\r\n\r\nSo the problem
    is with this one glyph and is something to do with the name of the glyph.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    got any ideas why the name /con/ should be so objectionable?"

  body: "Aha!\r\n\r\nWhile using my Windows machine to delete the mixed up UFO that
    I generated from Glyphs from a USB drive, I was suddenly confronted by this message:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/conn_5239.png]\r\n\r\nThat's
    weird, I thought, I should take a screenshot of that and post it on Typophile.
    So I did so, and when asked to name the image file I tried 'con.png'. And then
    I got the really weird message:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/conno_3468.png]\r\n\r\nSo
    it turns out that 'con' is one of the file/folder names that have been reserved
    as device driver names by Microsoft since the days of MS-DOS. <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/74496/en-us\">Here's
    a full list of such names.</a>\r\n\r\nThe moral of the story is: if you're trying
    to generate UFOs on Windows, or trying to open UFOs created on another platform,
    make sure that none of your glyphs are called /con/ /prn/ /aux/ /clock$/ /nul/
    (/NULL/ is thankfully okay) etc."

  body: "Thanks, James. Unfortunately I hit the same bug with UFO Central as I do
    with the RoboFab export script.\r\n\r\nAnd...\r\n\r\nAaaaaaaargh! Another aborted
    RoboFab script just saved my VFB for me -- which I did not ask it to do -- and
    did not create a backup, leaving me with a VFB in which all my composites have
    been decomposed.\r\n\r\nAll I'm trying to do is generate two UFOs to use as masters
    in UFOstretch. Yes, the fonts are large; yes, I'm using some unusual glyph naming
    structures; but really there's nothing in here that any of my other tools have
    a problem with."

    see what was going on in this thread till you spelled it out.  I assume DOS's
    \"copy/b filename con\" capability was borrowed from Unix -- perhaps OSX is better
    at hiding such details.\r\n\r\nDavid"
