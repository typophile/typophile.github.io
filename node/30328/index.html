Just wanted to ask if anyone has done any site signage of 50x60cm board before. 
I wanted to ask what font size did you use. At the moment I have 100pt, myriad. 
I think I may need to use something more condensed and bold though. 
It is to be visible from the road, say about 50-80m away, driving at about 50km.
Cheers.</div>

Rule of thumb: take the size of the type (cap height), go to the next unit of measurement (say from cm to m) and the multiply by 3 for difficult reading conditions (like from a driving car) or by 2 for normal conditions. Or divide the distance by 3 and take the next unit below (you could also simply divide by 300, but people often have problems with all those zeros). For 60m that would be 20m, next unit down is 20cm. There's your cap height, and that's roughly 800 point! 100 point would be visible, but not legíble.

And never use bold faces for signage. Bold is not better, as the counters fill up and obscure characters. Regular weights are best. When [[Adrian Frutiger]] designed the signage at Roissy airport, he made a weight between [[Frutiger]] 55 and 65 for black on yellow. For reversed-out signs that would have been the 55 weight. Our [[FF Transit]] gives different weights for positive and negative applications, plus back-lit and front-lit varieties. And with [[FF Info]], the weights are designed to be close enough together to chose neighbouring weights for different lighting conditions.</div>

Thanks for the equation on how to handle the size of th efont, only problem with using 800pt on a 40x50cm board is that I want get much text on the board, but there could be the problem, maybe a board of this size is expecting to much to have eliable type for driving past.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Right on, sister! One of the first jobs I ever did was a billboard for my uncle, who was a realtor in a small town here in New Hampshire. I set up the whole thing and even wrote the headline:

"When you want the lowdown on a New England town, ask a native."

It looked so nicely-balanced and serene taped onto my drawing board. Only trouble was, when it actually got put onto the giant surface, I drove past it at 45 mph and was horrified to realize that you could only read the first five words before you'd gone past the sign!

So Stuffy, in terms of your mocking up something, perhaps print it out on paper, tape it to the wall, and then (I'm not kidding) run past it to see how much of it you can see in one gestalt.

One of my favorite tricks learned from Friedrich Neugebauer is the use of a reducing glass -- very handy to see something brought down enough in size to judge if its line weights are strong enough, details too fussy or not discernible, and so forth, when it actually goes into a newspaper column or other given space. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">The simple answer is that your board is way the hell too small! You'll need a sign of about 3x6 meters to hold all that text and keep it legible, and at that point you're getting into the small billboard category. It is still way too long of a slogan for roadway signage.</div>

That is probably not a good idea to begin with. People are not even going to bother trying to read lots of text while driving along.
So you should probably rethink your strategy on this. :)</div>
