body: "I am selling my 1912 American Specimen Book of Type Styles.  I would love to
  see it end up in a loving home.  \r\n\r\nThe condition is incredible for such a
  old heavy tome.  The cover is discolored, but very much intact.  I've seen other
  copies where the hardcover is falling apart, but not mine.  The binding is excellent.
  \ The pages are bright white, with very little yellowing from age.  There is one
  page that I know of that has two very small images cut out, and one page with a
  few notations.  Almost every page is in very good to excellent condition.  It appears
  that it originally belonged to the Tribune newspaper in Wakarusa, Indiana, as indicated
  by the pencil inside the front cover that says \"Tribune Wakarusa Ind.\"  Please
  PM me for photos or with any questions.  Asking $1295.  I also made a video of me
  flipping through it that I plan to upload to youtube.  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SDC16646_6118.1.jpg]"

  body: I am into old books, and while the binding is in very good shape, I would
    not call that binding "excellent"....There are lots of very obvious wear signs
    in many places on it, some heavy wear like at the bottom of the book at its spine.....Your
    a bit to generous there I feel in the use of the word excellent.

  body: 'Thanks for the input.  Kind of was hoping for that as well.  I did change
    the term excellent in another place I listed this, but forgot to in what I wrote
    here.  I agree.  I listed at that price compared to two other copies on amazon
    at or over $1000, that seemed to be in worse condition than mine.  '

    body: Weren't some of those type books bound in leather? I would imagine the leather
      versions are quit rare........The hard binding yours is in is very common for
      that time period for many books that size...I have a 2 volume set of a famous
      Philosophy text book made in 1894 that looks very much like that same binding
      material.

  body: I recommend checking the Completed Auctions listing on eBay and see what that
    edition may have sold for there. I have the same edition as well as several older
    ones and didn't pay anywhere close to what you are asking.

  body: "Aaron, you should never use Amazon's used book prices as a guide to market
    value. There is a whole subset of Amazon sellers who float ridiculously high prices
    for books that they don't even have copies of; then they wait for a bite from
    a na\xEFve buyer before locating a copy at a much lower price and selling it on.
    These people are scumsucking parasites on the book trade enabled by Amazon's indiscriminate
    seller registration policy.\r\n\r\nJackson is right about the average price for
    that book, and that price is only so high because it is relatively rare. From
    the perspective of content, the 1923 ATF specimen book is the one to own, and
    it can be had for $125."

  body: Thanks for the perspective.  If anyone would like to make an offer much lower
    than the price I initially posted, please do.  I will not price it so high now.  Thanks
