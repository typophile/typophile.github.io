body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am working on an OpenType font for Latin and Cyrillic and
  after I generate the font it works differently in InDesign CS3 and Illustrator CS3
  (for MAC). the problem in InDesign is that the fractions do not work. In Illustrator
  the fractions work but the Superscript, Subscript and Denominator don't work. When
  I try it on PC the kerning and ligatures do not work. Interestingly enough, when
  I try it on (MAC) InDesign CS1 and Illustrator CS1 everything works perfectly.  What
  could be the problem? Any suggestions?"
