body: I work on an internal magazine for a large company. The CI typeface is Frutiger.
  I would like to keep this typeface for headlines and pull quotes, but not for the
  text. I cannot find a typeface which works great together with Frutiger. Times seems
  to be good, but I don&#39;t want to use it. Tooooooo many magazines use Times as
  a text typeface in the Czech Republic and I think the use of it is very ordinary.  <BR>
  <BR>I don&#39;t want something too extravagant. The typeface should be rather invisible,
  but elegant. It should be economical in space and legible in small size.  <BR> <BR>Thank
  you for any idea...

  body: '&#62; Times still a good font, special in 10pts, but i agree whit you. &#62;
    Because of massive use, Times became a little bit vulgar. For that &#62; propose
    i think Filosofia [from Emigre] it&#39;s a nice and elegant &#62; choice. &#62;'

    in space. The combination with Frutiger is balanced.  <BR> <BR>The Minion and
    Seria are good options to. '

  body: What about Meridien? Also by Frutiger. Very nice legible face. Really lovely
    italic. Sympathetic in form to Frutiger. No os figs or small caps so far as I
    know, though.

    :-&#41; <BR> <BR>What about Clearface? Somewhat old-fashioned, but a nice balance
    between interest and invisibility. The question is if it matches Frutiger. But
    note that Clearface has a sans, so maybe use that instead? <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s
    Whitman. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    text face also by Frutiger, and it includes small caps and os figures -- not sure
    if it&#39;s equipped for Czech...

  body: What about Charter? Good at small sizes, not too contrasty. Maybe not economical
    enough in width? <BR> <BR>Jon <BR>

  body: Actually, narrowness is only stricly economical for settings of one line -
    width can actually gain you more economy! By allowing a smaller point size, and
    less waste through line-breaks. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: We just did a project pairing John Baskerville with Frutiger, and it worked
    very well. <BR> <BR>&#43; John Baskerville was drawn by Storm &#40;who last I
    checked is Czech&#41; and is fully equipped with all of the necessary CE variations.
    <BR> <BR>But I am not sure if you want a serif for your text face...

  body: Thank you all for the suggestions. I think some ideas are great and I hope
    my client will be satisfied with the result. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t need a font
    with CE characters, I am experienced in font editing and I do the localization
    very often.
