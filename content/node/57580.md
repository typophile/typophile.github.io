  an interim logotype for my personal website, <a href=\"http://untu.ms/\">untu.ms</a>.
  It used to include the dot from the address as well, but I couldn't make it work,
  so I took it out. The word \"<em>untums</em>\" means \"whimsy\" in Latvian. I'd
  be very grateful for any critiques."

  body: Well it's certainly different - I really like your u's and how they connect
    to the other letters - those shapes definitely have a sense of the whimsical about
    it. I'm not sold on the offset colors. It's a touch disturbing and detracts from
    the whimsical mood. Just some thoughts.

  body: "I see the 3-d thing you are doing. But to me it comes across as jarring,
    not pleasing. I don't think a logo should ever frustrate someone's eye.\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of the actual mark, the u-n and u-m connections are nice, but I feel like
    the \"t\" and \"s\" need a lot of attention to make them feel similar. right now
    they stick out as being different."

  body: "I don't mind the 3-D thing but I agree with Chriss the T and S are the odds
    one out still. \r\n\r\nWhat's missing in those is the rounded inner corner that
    the other letterforms have. \r\n\r\nIt'd be easy to add to the S by connecting
    it to the M. The 't' will be tricker."

  body: Sorry for not following up. I feel like I've painted myself in a corner with
    this concept. I tried some of the suggestions like connecting the letters or punching
    a hole in the corner, but it either still looked boring or was unreadable. I guess
    I need to just start over.

  body: "To me, the effect you have on the type looks like bad registration on a printed
    piece. As for the letters themselves, not really my style, but I can't say that
    it\u2019s done poorly."

  body: "The treatment is actually more accidental than intentional, since I took
    this version of the logo from my blog design. The shape is the part that interests
    me. I guess I should have spelled that out. Here's a version with less distractions,
    the \"t\" merged into \"um\" and a hole punched out:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/own_logo2_4438.png]\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I still read it as \"untums\", but I'm not so sure it'll be as clear to others."

  body: "Ew, that's unfortunate. I have earrings, but piercings elsewhere aren't my
    thing.\r\n\r\nLooking at the merged and non-merged version again, I'm pretty sure
    the problem comes from the letter \"t\". The merged one (lacking the \"t\") seems
    much better."

  body: "It's kind of hard to read it as \"untu.ms\" and not \"untums\" without knowing
    it's a quirky domain name. I mean if I were to see on a website, then, yeah, I'd
    know what the punched out hole is about. But if you were to show me this printed
    on a paper, no way I'd read it as a web address. \r\n\r\nNice wordmark though.
    I can read the merged version OK, it's legible enough."
