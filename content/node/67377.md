    is the most contemporary in your opinions?

    Genre FontList</a>.\r\nIt depends on the application, of course: Fry's Baskerville
    is great for display, but the high contrast makes it unusable for text.\r\n<a

    and <a href=\"http://fountaintype.com/typefaces/baskerville-1757\">Fountain</a>
    both have interesting and fresh renditions \u2013 the former being way more versatile
    than the latter."

  body: "Also check for kerning. Some foundries have lousy metrics.\r\n\r\nIf you
    deal with European customers frequently and elect to purchase an OpenType font,
    check the effectiveness of the Context Sensitive Layout functions with a text
    sequence such as this:\r\n\r\n\u2039abc\u203A \u2039ABC\u203A  \r\n\xABabc\xBB
    \xABABC\xBB \r\n\xA1abc! \xA1ABC!  \r\n\xBFabc? \xBFABC?\r\n\r\nalso, \r\n\r\n[abc]
    [ABC] {abc} {ABC} (abc) (ABC) \r\na-b\u2013c\u2014d A-B\u2013C\u2014D\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t
    settle for a font that does not have small caps either. You might not use it this
    job, but it will come in handy for the next.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
