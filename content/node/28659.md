body: "I'm working on a few very rough comps for a Book Design class I'm taking. Right
  now we're working on Book Jacket design and I've run into a wall. If you look at
  the image, you'll see that I need to make the type distort so it looks like it's
  actually running on the 'tape' My thought was to use Envelope Distort but that just
  sends the type to funky town and it's totally unreadable. Right now it's just running
  Type On A Path with the same path I've used to create the tape. Any suggestions
  would be awesome!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vespers_6217.png]"

  body: "My personal opinion is to redo your concept so that you don't have to distort
    the type at all. That's a typography no no in my books.   Also, right now it's
    reading \"The Vespers A Novel Tapes\"\r\n\r\nConceptually this seams like the
    simplest solution to your book cover problem. Think this way: what other types
    of tape are there and how can they be used? Video tape, scotch tape, duct tape...etc
    etc....I'm guessing this is video tape you're trying to convey? Maybe showing
    video tape is too obvious then.  Also think about mood. What type of book is this?
    Comedy? Mystery? Horror? I have no clue from this design. \r\n\r\nAbout book covers...whatever
    your design, think about how the viewer is going to see it and how many different
    situations. The rule of thumb I use is to think how it will still look when reduced
    to an itty bitty postage stamp size, like when sold in catalogs as well as on
    book shelves. All that text you are trying to wrap isn't going to read at a small
    catalog size. \r\n\r\nI have some great ideas but I think you should work it out
    on your own. Good luck!\r\n\r\nAnyone else agree?"

  body: "I said it's a rough concept because if I can get the type to do what I want
    then I'll be able to execute my idea. Also, the project is front, spine and back
    cover, my idea spans all three to create one idea. Basically I'm just looking
    for possible solutions, if I end up using this concept I'll post the whole idea
    in a comprehensive layout.\r\n\r\nIt's a book about a mafia boss who is dying
    and hires a teacher to record his lifestory on tape and how the rest of the mafia
    responds and how it puts the teacher in danger.\r\n\r\nThanks for your critique,
    but it's not really what I was looking for."

  body: "The best way to do it is photographically, create a flat mock-up, position
    it and shoot it with a copy camera setup, and then do a bit of Photoshop to clean
    it up, you <em>could</em> illustrate it but the effect involves a lot of work
    to achieve a believable effect.\r\nTim"
