  and I'm a last year student in Graphic Media Technology at Artevelde Hogeschool,
  Ghent. \r\nSubject of my thesis this year is designing fonts and the technology
  around this process, how this all happened in the past and in todays time. \r\n\r\nBut
  I'm still looking for a dutch speaking (Belgian) 'external promotor'. \r\nAn external
  promotor is a professional that only has an advisory role. Who could give me interesting
  sources or objectives for my work. \r\n\r\nMy question for everyone here is: if
  someone knows, or better if you are a person that fits this description please share
  his/her or your e-mail or other information with me. \r\n\r\nYou can always contact
  me at: lowie.wellens@student.arteveldehs.be or send me a pm on my typophile account.\r\n\r\nThank
  you all for your support\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nLowie"
