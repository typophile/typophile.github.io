  body: "Wow, Florian, what a memory you have to dig this thread up!\r\n\r\nBTW, Markus
    contacted me a couple times about his frustration (which I totally understood).
    I did e-mail him directly a week or two ago to inform him that these were finally
    available. I don't know if the contact info I had is still current. So hopefully,
    one way or another, he now knows about this. ;-)\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
