body: "This is my first font. \r\nIt is an optical sizing font with 6 masters. The
  reason for this is the dots do not change size but multiply with sizing up.\r\n\r\nIt
  is 6 individual sizes from 80pt to 180pt, with 20pt intervals. The lettershapes
  are based on railway thin, with some variation here and there.\r\n\r\nSome of the
  letters look a bit odd/ugly to me (the A, the Q, the B and P) I\u2019m really after
  help mostly with the kerning  (but please feel free to comment on any aspect)\r\n\r\nLooking
  forward to some feedback. Thanks.\r\n\r\n<a href=http://www.filedropper.com/pinpointstest><img

  body: "Nicer than I expected actually.\r\n\r\nTo me two things jump out:\r\n- The
    density is not constant (smaller = darker). This is usually avoided.\r\n- You
    typically need more sizes on the smaller end - not equal steps.\r\n\r\nIn terms
    of letterforms I think only the \"W\" is unhappy. And the \"S\" is leaning backwards.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I know what you mean about the density not being constant hrant - for the
    use of the font it wasn't possible to resize the dots, but rather to reduce and
    rearrange them for each size - so I have to live with the darker smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nI
    made a few adjustments circled in red. Fixed some of the S's and other letters,
    haven't touched the W's - not sure whats wrong with them.\r\nhttp://www.filedump.net/dumped/pinpointstest21357532333.jpg"

  body: "The \"W\" is too open in the top half. If you don't want to make the lines
    more vertical (to avoid making it way too wide) then you're going to have to cross
    over the inside diagonals (or at least extend one of them).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
