body: "Polyester is a 'blended' sans that came about through experimenting with interpolation.
  I took two other fonts I'm working on and did a 50% blend, tidied up the stray points
  and here's the synthesis. (Top is untitled techy sans, bottom is Carnet, also up
  for crit in this section.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Polyester-Blend_4348.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Polyester

  body: "To me, the top one is nice but not fantastic. Carnet on the other hand IS
    fantastic. So, blending it with a 'nice but not fantastic font' is not really
    worth it. Sure, it's a quick way to get an extra typeface, but I don't think it
    actually adds something. Just something I notice in Carnet:\r\nBecause the descenders
    are so short, there's little room for your g. It looks to me as if it has a smaller
    pnt size. Maybe try to make it wider, or just go for a single story g. Hope this
    helps."

    somewhat cramped) otherwise it means something more serious is out of whack somewhere
    else. This is a classic dark paradox in text face design.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think you mix is very interesting. It's a little quirky, but looks like
    a \"neutral\" between two mediums.\r\n\r\nAs far as I go, I like the top one,
    in terms of creative coolness. It's one of those fonts I like to stare at all
    day. I have the same problem with Eurostile, but not quite so much. Carnet would
    be a very good text face.\r\n\r\nThe synthesis is quite tasty indeed. Something
    about it reminds me of 1940s or 50s design."

  body: "Yeah, Carnet's /g/ could have the right counter sizes only by taking this
    slightly 'pressed' form.\r\n\r\nThe top font was a pretty quick experiment, and
    hasn't been properly tuned (yet) so the widths and colour balance are off.\r\n\r\nDo
    you have any suggestions for improvements? "

  body: Here we go with the first draft of the extrabold.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SentosaII_5734.gif]
    The slightly pinched terminals are reminding me of the heavier weights of de Groot's
    lovely <a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/sun/sun/">Sun</a>.

  body: I like it. Although the 'a' in 'pizzicato' seems to be too wide around the
    bend at the top.

  body: "New PDF attached to original post.\r\n\r\nGlyphs are all drawn for the Medium
    weight. Still working on spacing and kerning then this one looks like it  might
    be 'finished'! (Though crit is always very welcome of course.)\r\n\r\nOn a sidenote,
    can anyone with a knowledge of different foundries suggest which ones I should
    contact regarding publishing some of my fonts? I was considering selling myself
    through MyFonts but it seems there's a lot to be gained by being released through
    a respected foundry that can make any final tweaks, check compatibility and guarantee
    quality. Maybe I should start a new thread?"

  body: "Looking great! I really really like the idea of a \"techno\" font that has
    some subtlety to the drawing.\r\nDiacritics on the caps both tall and high - no
    problems with crashing?\r\nWhat's up with the f-ligs at the end that aren't ligs?\r\nIs
    $ a little wonky?"

  body: "Thanks, Craig. Do you mean the f-ligs should be connected or kerned closer
    together?\r\n\r\n$: Maybe that's one of those familiarity problems. What do you
    see wrong with it?\r\n\r\nDiacritics: I think the specimen is set at default leading,
    and the marks aren't crashing. Would you prefer shallower shapes on the caps anyway?"

  body: "I just couldn't tell how the f-ligs differed from /f/ and /i/, and wondered
    if they actually got turned off in the specimen. If they're intended to be unconnected,
    would a contextual-alternate /f/ serve you better than ligatures?\r\n\r\nOn the
    dollar, the issue I see is the closed counterspaces being so small compared to
    the open counters on the other side of the bar. This (it seems to me) can be an
    issue with this glyph when the bar is bold, or when the apertures of the /S/ are
    open, and in this case you have both going on. Did/would you consider a dollar
    with the bar not passing through the /S/?\r\n\r\nOn the diacriticals, I suppose
    if there's no crashing there's no problem. \r\n\r\nA couple other notes: I wonder
    if your breve is too shallow. Will your pound get read as an /E/? Is the end of
    the ampersand that comes up too closed-looking compared to the open apertures
    of /S/ etc.?"

  body: "Oh, right. I'd read a thread somewhere that said best to draw f-lig glyphs
    even if they're no different from their component parts, for maximal compatibility.
    What benefit do you see in a c.alt?\r\n\r\n$: You mean just the spurs at the extrema
    instead of running through? Or I could rotate the bar round?\r\n\r\nI like your
    other questions. I was wondering a similar thing about breve...again a familiarity
    thing...I've never needed to use one and the open counter style of this face seemed
    to fit a shallow one, but I think I'll make it a bit more pronounced. I'll look
    at those other two glyphs. I'm not quite happy with ampersand myself."

    a difference between the /f/ and the /f/ in /fi/fl/ffi/?"

    because fi and fl are maybe the only ligatures which have their Unicode codepoints.
    But, IIRC, Adobe deprecates their use in favour of the proper Unicode feature."
