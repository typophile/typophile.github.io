  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been reading here for some time now and finally decided to register and participate. So I&#39;m posting something to be criticized, as a start. <BR>Explanation: sulPET is the annual meeting of all PET - Programa Especial de Treinamento, &#34;special training program&#34; from universities in southern Brazil. PET is kind of a study/research group made up by really good students &#40;you need high grades to get into a PET&#41; and professors. There are PETs about all areas of study - Architecure, Engineering, Literature, Biology...  <BR>So this is the 8th sulPET, and the three small sentences on the right are this year&#39;s subject: &#40;from top to bottom&#41; Sharing Knowledge, Science and Society, Constructing Paths. <BR>We&#39;ve tried to stay away from &#34;pictorial&#34; logo because the budget is very low and we don&#39;t feel it makes much sense to create a logo that will be lost as soon as the meeting is over. <BR>This year&#39;s meeting focuses on the relationship between PETs and society in general, in opposition to other years which were generally about inside-PET discussions. We tried to convey that by putting the subject lines as outgoing lines that start from the word PET. That&#39;s the main idea we think should be passed to the participants: that this year is about an outgoing thought, not restrictive on the PET.  <BR>Oh, the font is Helvetica, in it&#39;s Bold and Black variations. We tried to keep it straightforward and simple so we tried with different sans-serif fonts, but Helvetica has such a nice balance we decided for it. A classic&#39;s a classic, eh? <BR> <BR>Anyway... we&#39;re open to all king of suggestions, concepts, typographic details, etc etc. Thank you all <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52539.png" alt="here&#39;s the image"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">My only thought is to make the type on the rotating divisions the same size. By making them different sizes it &#40;one&#41; looks like a mistake or &#40;two&#41; you are making some more important than others.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here&#39;s the new, updated version! We&#39;re trying to reinforce the &#34;getting out&#34; idea, and thought that to communicate it we had to show that things were getting out FROM somewhere. The great thing about this is that it&#39;s still a two-color job, but feels like there&#39;s more.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53359.jpg" alt="new logo"> <BR>&#40;the orange doesn&#39;t look so nice in RGB...&#41; <BR> <BR>Any suggestions, critique, ideas, anyone?

		<div class="commentbody">the legibility on the angled words is lost now. <BR> <BR>the black outlines on all the orange words are making it look like desktop publishing.  not very professional. <BR> <BR>can the VIII look a bit more like roman numerals. &#40;ie - add horizontal bars?&#41;  it gets lost for me, blending in with sul. <BR> <BR>the box isn&#39;t really needed.  the older version was better.  maybe try making a &#34;box&#34; out of the other elements?</div>

I think evolving a logo by making it more illustrative and less legible are the wrong directions. <BR>Maybe try rearranging all of the same elements as the year before, stacking, turning, scaling, until it&#39;s similar but unique.  <BR> <BR>aaron</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Normally, I don&#39;t think continuity is a bad thing either. However, according to the people who are organizing this event, this one is a turning point in terms of content - it&#39;s a new direction. So they don&#39;t want it to look like it&#39;s a sequel of last year. Also, there was no previous continuity, every year it&#39;s hosted by a different university and a whole different groups works on it.  <BR> <BR>Steve: that&#39;s an interesting idea, maybe it would have problems when reduced, but I&#39;ll try it anyway. Thanks <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>&#40;I should be posting something here, but there hasn&#39;t been much improvement...&#41;</div>
