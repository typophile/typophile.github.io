  body: It seems like it's derived from Eurostile. As if they just clipped the curves
    at the corners of some of the letters, or maybe a bit more fiddling. When is it
    from?

    Athlete. Published in 1969.

    which I designed as a sort of "angular Eurostile".

  body: Thanks Tim. I like Mashine, but it feels a little Russian Constructivist versus
    the sample. It's for a documentary about the Black Power movement in the late
    '60s and early '70s, so that's what we're going for.

    wow you get a lot of bang for your buck with United Sans.

  body: ">bang for your buck with United Sans\r\n\r\nYeah, Tal Leming is one of the
    awesome double-talents in type design, being a programming maven and a very good
    designer. See also [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=565|Burbank]],
    where he makes a well crafted animated-cartoon style font and then multiplies
    it with a dizzying variety of styles. Being able to multiply styles is where being
    a techno-wizard gives you an edge.  \r\n\r\n>thanks\r\n\r\nYou're most welcome!"

    It must be an old phototypositer face. It isn't quite loose enough to be a FontDiner
    retro so I don't know if it was ever digitized. It has that industrial look mixed
    with college letter sweater feel.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
