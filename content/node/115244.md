  PM.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nI posted some of the characteristic letters that most font searches
  will ask for... I've tried searching myself and the closest I've found is \"Leitura
  Sans Grot 3\" or Leitura Sans Grot 4\" It isn't quite 100 percent though.. The corners
  seem to be a bit \"softer\" and a few letters are different (lower case \"g\" has
  a slanted bar in leitura but a horizontal in this font I am searching for)\r\n\r\n
  Any help is greatly appreciated "
