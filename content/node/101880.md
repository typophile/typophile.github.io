  body: "The proprietary font is named 'Easyjet'  (surprise!). It comes in both rounded
    and plain extended families.  The family includes at least Book, Light, Demi,
    Bold, and Headline variants, as well as matching italics. In some instances the
    font is simply named EJ.\r\n(Information from fonts used in PDF's on their website)\r\n
