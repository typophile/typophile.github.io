		<div class="commentbody"><p>The most basic reason I can think of is to help the reader find his or her place in a book, especially if the title is on the verso and the section or chapter name is on the recto. Another reason would be if a page gets separated from a book, to easily identify it.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s an article on running heads, by John D. Berry, which goes into a lot more detail: <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/article/dot-font-running-heads">How to deal with those little scraps of text on a page that tell us what document we&rsquo;re reading, and where we are in it.</a></p>
<p>Why at the top? Berry writes, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a practical advantage to keeping both the running head and the page number at the top of the page. If the text may end at different points on different pages, or if you might need to add a line or cut a line at the bottom of the page to avoid a widow, then a running foot would draw attention to these variations; a running head would not.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The John Berry article noted above pretty much says it all. That&rsquo;s a good place to start.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that each book&rsquo;s needs have to be considered; there&rsquo;s no one-size fits-all way to handle running heads. I&rsquo;m looking at a recent book done here. On the verso we placed the part-title rather than the chapter title. No folio on the verso. On the recto, only the folio. Why? I&rsquo;m not sure. Probably as Berry remarked: sometimes we just do these kinds of things to running heads for something &ldquo;different&rdquo; or &ldquo;noticeable,&rdquo; to prove we are designers.</p>
<p>The content of running heads is primarily an editorial decision, rarely a design decision. When an editor hands over a manuscript for design, there should be a separate file with the contents for running heads. The appearance of running heads is primarily a design decision, often done in consultation with the editor.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I didn&rsquo;t read the Berry article, so if I repeat, forgive me. But I think Will has it about right, it is an editorial prerogative.</p>
<p>BTW, in journals, the article title is often on the verso, author on the recto.</p>
<p>When done best, the running heads often mirror the contents page. There are books where the A-level subheads are listed in the contents. In such cases, the best running head structure would be chapter title on the verso, current A-head on the rightie.</p>
<p>If subheads aren&rsquo;t on the contents, but there are part titles (&amp; they&rsquo;d be on the contents page), then it would be part title on the verso, CT on the recto.</p>
<p>The contents page and running heads work best as a sort of mini-index, that is, helping the reader find what they are interested in in the book/journal. Seems to me a lot of contemporary editors forget this &ndash; or I&rsquo;m out-of-date again.</p>
<p>Repeating the book title for 300 pages sort of implies you think the reader is too stupid to be reading the book anyway. But come to think on it, that&rsquo;s how a lot of editors seem to feel, so maybe it is appropriate.</p>

The tradition lives on in anthologies, and it pays to have the name of the book as a running head in such projects.

<p>I suspect the very stingy book buyer might have several smaller books bound together to save costs. In such a case a tradition of putting the title on the running heads may have developed.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">True Bert. But the serialization was not normally in book sections, but in magazines of the day, where one episode of the Dickens tale would be a portion of the content of the magazine. Initially Dickens worked for other publishers, and eventually he published magazines in which his own works would appear. I doubt that the magazine sections would be suitable to binding, but never having seen any, I cannot attest to this.</div>

<p>If you have decided to use only one folio per spread, you should just decide where you want that folio for design reasons. In a few pages readers will be accustomed to its placement, and when they need folios they&rsquo;ll find them with no problem. Don&rsquo;t make too much of a scientific quest out of this question.</p>
<p>I have seen single-folio spreads with folios in just about every conceivable position. I doubt readers had trouble finding them. With the exception of the following:</p>
<p>One always wants to be wary of placing folios too close into the bind gutter. Depending on how the book is bound, you risk losing folios in the bind. &amp; if the book is ever re-bound, good-bye folios.</p>

<p>I find your sample feels unbalanced. I keep getting the idea that the recto folio isn&rsquo;t finished. I have seen some folio arrangements where a single title is split, half on each side of the folio, and omitted when a verso chapter end means the second half will not appear on the recto.</p>
<p>As was said before, there are no rules.</p>

<p>@Don: I think it feels unbalanced as well. That&rsquo;s not final. I was just trying different approaches. I have some more traditional versions as well.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>most pictures are put on the recto.  why do you think that&rsquo;s so?</p>
<p>when chapter-headers are intentionally placed only on one side,
it&rsquo;s the recto side:  why do you think that&rsquo;s so?</p>
<p>however, if by &ldquo;folio&rdquo;, you mean page-number,
then if you made an &ldquo;editorial&rdquo; decision to only
place it on the recto or the verso, then i think
the functional thing to do is to kill the &ldquo;editor&rdquo;
who made that &ldquo;editorial decision&rdquo;, and the <em>most</em>
functional thing is to do it as quickly as possible&hellip;</p>
