body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Paperback</strong>\r\n\r\nDesigned by
  [[John Downer]] for [[House Industries]], Paperback is a sturdy serif type family
  designed to work well in the most taxing of printing conditions. Paperback is not
  an imitation or revival of any existing typeface. \"The romans have a [[rationalist
  axis]],\" says Downer; \"the italics a [[humanist axis]]. Individual letterforms
  were constructed according to my own design philosophy and aesthetic sensibility,
  deliberately avoiding major historical influences.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Additional Articles:</strong>\r\n<a
