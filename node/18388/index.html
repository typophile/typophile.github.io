<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/National-nab.jpg]</p>
<p>Yet another rendered 3D icon with all lowercase text. All l/c seems to be the first stop for convincing people you’re ‘friendly and approachable’ these days. Or has it always been that way? What is it about lowercase that’s so friendly? Is it just the variations in character height creating a looser feel, in the same way that ragged text creates a less formal look than justified text?</p>
<p>If they are trying to be more friendly, the &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; type seems at odds with the strong, bold colours, and I don’t think the rendered logo and flat text fit with each other. Can’t a logo be good anymore without being all 3D?</p>
<p>I know the old type’s Futura, but what’s the new one?</p>
<p>Typographical issues aside, I find it bewildering that a bank would choose to identify itself with a word that means, ‘to take or grab suddenly’ and ‘to catch and arrest a criminal’. I mean, their candour is refreshing, but none the less surprising.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, I really like a lot of the ANZ advertising stuff, but he hasn&rsquo;t got me with this one. I don&rsquo;t mind the seriousness of the colours; I think too many banks are trying to portray themselves as your best mate from next door, and it can come off as too casual and unprofessional. I want my bank to be focussed on business, not heading out with me to the pub. I think it&rsquo;s just the lowercase and the fact that it now says &lsquo;nab&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone say &lsquo;nab&rsquo;, only &lsquo;National&rsquo; or &lsquo;N.A.B&rsquo;, so I find it strange that the bank&rsquo;s encouraging people to use a name with such an obvious alternate meaning.</div>

<p>I know a few people who work for &lsquo;nab&rsquo; and they refer it as &lsquo;nab&rsquo; not &lsquo;N.A.B&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not sure if the NAB scandal is completely forgotten, but I think changing to &lsquo;nab&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t play to their favour since their image isn&rsquo;t squeaky-clean.</p>
<p>As for the colour, perhaps they bought in more black to differentiate NAB from Westpac. I can get confused between the two from a long distance (i.e. signage/atm).</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It could be much, much worse.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Exactly. It really isn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>
<p>The font is Lucas De Groot&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Mix<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ve been waiting about five years for this variety of progressive type design to graduate to mainstream use with major corporations. All power to Lucas.</p>
<p>3D&mdash;what 3D?</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re overeacting to something new, simply because it is new and not the same as its predecessor. Try not being so cynical. Accept things at face value and avoid projecting your personal values onto them.</p>
<p>People who work inside the corporation and industry insiders refer to it as &ldquo;nab&rdquo;, but that phraseology does not&mdash;has not&mdash;filtered into common parlance, so the perjorative meaning of &ldquo;nab&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a big issue. Certainly the new ad campagne on television does not call it &ldquo;nab&rdquo;.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I’ve never heard anyone say ‘nab’, only ‘National’ or ‘N.A.B’&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is what I mean.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;the ‘friendly’ type seems at odds with the strong, bold colours&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how. How is it that those forms are at odds with the bold color scheme? Give it a break.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think combining nab and red/white on black is a bad idea, it looks absolutely criminal.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>How does it evoke &ldquo;criminal&rdquo;? I think you guys just don&rsquo;t want to like it, without coming up with good reasons why its bad.</p>

Is it just the variations in character height creating a looser feel, in the same way that ragged text creates a less formal look than justified text?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Partly, yes. But fundamentally, Latin capitals are synonymous with iron-fisted authority, officialdom and rigid social formality. They&rsquo;re an invention of the ancient Romans, who too often valued pompousness and grandeur above human concerns. The roman Latin capital forms draw on the formal, constructed, component-based nature of classical architecture&mdash;Roman &amp; Greek temples and official public buildings. They&rsquo;re based on circles, squares, triangles, straight lines and right angles&mdash;perfect Euclidian geometry the ancients assumed was indelible and unalterable, imune to any fault or criticism.</p>
<p>All of that stuff was deeply concerned with authority, and an even more inflexible idea&mdash;the all-powerful will of the ancient gods who supposedly ruled people&rsquo;s lives. Latin capitals have been employed ever since by people in positions of power to assert their dominance and authority.</p>
<p>In the present political atmosphere where corporations and govenments are held accountable, scutinized for corruption and abuses of power, even the tiniest failure to account for their liabilities, a typographic depiction of authority is the last thing a powerful corporation like a bank wants as its public face. So yes, it is a determined effort at appearing human and freindly. For a large bank that&rsquo;s paradoxical, since large banks are extremely powerful and noted for their inflexibility towards customers. But that&rsquo;s marketing.</p>
<p>Start with the assumption that all advertising is a big fat lie. Too bad the intention is phoney. Expect nothing and you can&rsquo;t be disappointed. Nevermind the insincere will of those who fabricate these lies. Separate politics from design. I know, I know, they&rsquo;re related&mdash;the first causes the second. But it is possible to ignore that aspect and appreciate art &amp; design, however commercial, for its own sake, for what it is rather than the company it represents.</p>
<p>There is much more to typographic design and this logo design than may be first realized. It isn&rsquo;t just a matter of lower case versus caps. Significantly, the lower case forms in this logo are of a humanist design. Humanism started in the Renaissance period; the movement symbolized the rejection by scholars and artists of the oppressive empirical governance of the Holy Roman Empire and the Church, and the rise of the independent city states in Europe, the exemplary model being the very first&mdash;Florence.</p>
<p>With the rediscovery of ancient knowledge, in particular Aristotle&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Organon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ldquo;The tool&rdquo; (a philosophical device that allowed ordinary people to demystify all that baffled them), along with the architect Brunelleschi&rsquo;s discovery of central perspective (in painting), the seven liberal arts and with the study of nature became separated for the first time from state and church, prompting the humanists to place man at the center of the world, in place of God, man as determiner of his life as an individual and of his own destiny.</p>
<p>The creators of the new N.A.B logo may not have had all that in mind when they chose The Mix as the font. But humanist cultural values are ingrained in the letter forms regardless, and they do carry specific meaning thru their visual sense. This humanist aesthetic is not present in Latin capitals or geometric sans serifs. The Mix has serifs too&mdash;a reference to the humanist antiqua type model. That is the kind of rationale I would use to select The Mix instead of a traditional book roman or a geometric face. You want good public relations? Avoid industrial art &amp; design as well.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know it could be worse. They could have used the colour palette for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Commonwealth Games<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. As I said before: I like the colours and I don’t really mind the star; I’m mostly concerned with the lowercase text.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How is it that those forms are at odds with the bold color scheme? Give it a break.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I think the strong colours and the gleaming star create a look and feel that is almost militant. Can I scoot around Godwin’s Law by saying a certain well-known political party selected those colours for a reason? ;-) Then you glance down and there’s this informal, hello!, da de da, bit of text that - for me - just doesn’t quite fit. It’s too casual in contrast to the other elements.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->3D—-what 3D?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Sure, it’s not all singing, all dancing 3D, but it still has a bevelled effect. Maybe I’m wrong, but I feel like it should be one style or the other. Render both or neither.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m being cynical or projecting too much, but if I’m the only person who double-takes at ‘nab’, well, good luck to them. Many happy banking returns, etc, etc. :-)</p>
<p>So it’s not The Mix. Is it a custom job then?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it looks okaaay. It is easier on the eye than the old one. The eye takes it in faster ( recognizes it ) too. Thats a major consideration. I think that it might have been smarter or cooler to use a warmer red to play up the australianess (sp?) - but then I am a yank &amp; I don&rsquo;t know how aussies feel about colors. Also, having to color match all the time might be too expensive. As far as &lsquo;nab&rsquo; goes - I think people are getting more &amp; more used to acronym-homonyms of in media. For instance for me, &lsquo;CIA&rsquo; brings 3 organizations to mind readlily. The US gov arm, Culinary Institute of America, and the Cleveland Institute of Art ( <a href="http://www.cia.edu">http://www.cia.edu</a> ), if I was Canadian the list would no doubt be longer. Now, is the design wonderful? No. It isn&rsquo;t. But It will probably serve the company better than the old logo which was was a pig&rsquo;s breakfast. Also, if they decide to reverse black &amp; white later it will be easy &amp; no one will notice very much.</div>

Which, now that I reread it, says:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The seven-pointed red star remains, but its two lines, originally intended to mark the merger of Commercial Bank and National Bank of Australasia, have been tapered to look more &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>&ldquo;Our task was to translate their strategy and positioning into a compelling brand identity and look and feel.
The new logo is just that. Friendly lower case NAB. A bolder brighter star. And a striking black background provides the stand out that distinguishes NAB from the other red and white banks in Australia.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yves, I&rsquo;m curious what fault you find with the type? How is The Mix better?
It seems well constructed to me. I might add a little contrast, but it seems like preference.</p>
<p>In gereral I think it&rsquo;s nice. The disadvantage I see is that they&rsquo;ve lost their grid. Before, the star&rsquo;s parallel sides framed the N (never noticed that about a 7 point star). Now it&rsquo;s balanced, but not as tight. They still use it horizontal (<a href="http://www.national.com.au/About_Us/0,,175,00.html?ncID=ZBA">http://www.national.com.au/About_Us/0,,175,00.html?ncID=ZBA</a>) but the proportions feel a little too equal between mark and type in this format. But overall &hellip; workable. No reason for outcry IMO.</p>

<p>If the new logo is intended to be a signifier that the National Australia Bank is reinventing itself as a new and different bank from its old incarnation, then I think it falls short. The change is so subtle it just says to me &ldquo;we are re-doing our stationary&rdquo; not, we are the new NAB.</p>

<p>I live in Australia and I was not even aware &ldquo;nab&rdquo; was the National Australia Bank. It just goes to prove that the logo retouch seems to be an impatient upgrade.</p>
<p>Take for example the Shell and Ontario Trillium upgrades. Slow, decade and generational changes. When you fidget too much with your identity too much, especially for a Bank (stable, secure, professional), it obviously signifies trepidation amongst its upper ranks.</p>
<p>As for the lower case phenomena. THANK GOD!</p>
<p>Lower case feels balanced in this case. Why should there need to be a hierarchy suggested in the logo?</p>
<p>Not that I mind upper case in logos. But their absense does not painfully harm a good branding.</p>
<p>As for the use of the acronym NAB. Sounds like a very comical choice. Perhaps the designer knew he could get away with providing a diservice for the client.</p>

<p>OK. 
If a business has been around long enough that its original logo is in danger of coming back into fashion, then it’s time to nip that retro cachet in the bud. A well-established corporation shouldn’t look hip, but bland and mainstream, because it is.</p>
