  Club\" some time ago.\r\nAs I was playing around with the logotype I had a sort
  of new look for a type.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/friends1_5447.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  have created the other letters and here they are.\r\nI would like to know your opinion
  on it. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_4664.jpg]\r\n\r\nI would
  like to create the font and use it so before I go on I would like to know what you
  think.\r\n\r\nThe logo is here: [[http://www.florin.reel.ro/folio/logos.html#friends]]\r\n\r\nPlease
  comment/critique.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Florinf, I hope you are trying to get to something that appears \"carefree\"
    and \"friendly.\"\r\n\r\nThe diagonals of the y, and perhaps the other l.c. diagonal
    features seem a bit light for the rest.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the k should be an alternate.
    \r\n\r\n>...to do some serious type design, modifying an existing font is not
    a good place to start.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Nick means \"to begin your education in
    doing some serious type design\" ? I've counted, and 96% of the serious type design
    I do begins with modifying an existing font. If I had to start digitizing from
    scratch every time, I'd be dead by now. It goes without saying that the vast majority
    of those modifications were to my fonts which might be the other thing Nick means.
    \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: If you want to modify a font...go for it! But...don't sell it a brand new
    font either. Sure, a lot of people try to recreate parts of fonts...and they end
    up EXACTLY like one they were modifying. It's annoying and stupid. You can start
    with a basic font, like Helvetica...or something similar to what you are going
    for. But, have a plan. The current font you have brought forth....is just a change
    to an existing font. It looks like you sat down and said "I want to change Times."
    Ok...well, you changed it! But, was there a purpose in changing it, or not? From
    what I'm seeing...there was no purpose to changing. That to me is the difference.
    Change with a purpose is cool because you can explain what you changed and why
    you changed it. Change for the sake of change...is just an experiment. Experiments
    aren't bad, but they should never be sold, or passed off as anything but a small
    change to an existing font.

  body: "Janek: <em>As sure as shit some of them are modified versions of Frutiger,
    nay?</em>\r\n\r\nI very much doubt any of them were made by opening up the Frutiger
    fonts in a font editing application and modifying the BCP paths. Not only is that
    illegal, it is not something a professional type designer would want to get caught
    doing.\r\n\r\nDavid: <em>I've counted, and 96% of the serious type design I do
    begins with modifying an existing </em>[my]<em> font...</em>\r\n\r\nI do that
    too, though not quite so much.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is what I said; if you want
    to do some serious type design, don't start by transforming someone else's font
    files.\r\nThis is a pedagogic principle; it's like, do life drawing rather than
    tracing over photos.\r\nThe habits you start with form semantic grooves that inform
    your work, just as the school you go to and the companies you start working for
    color your subsequent career. \r\n\r\nI don't deny that there are skills to be
    acquired in cut-and-paste and morph and tweak &c., but learning how to construct
    a font from scratch is the most solid foundation. It especially gives you a grasp
    of the underlying mechanics of a font: vertical metrics, stem widths, sidebearings,
    overshoot, &c."

  body: "Thank you all for such a long debate.\r\nActually I didn't expected to get
    a reply after more than a year since posting.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, I had to
    do a logo (in 2001) and wrote the name of that club. \r\nI wasn't satisfied with
    it and did some adjustments to the letters.\r\nEverything was fine and the logo
    was approved and maybe the year after, I thought it would be nice to have a font
    like that. \r\n\r\nI took Times, indeed, and modified the letters in CorelDraw
    and then exported them as a font. It's a font since then, but I never sold it,
    or offered it for free, so it's more like a set o letters in an image. Never used
    it again.\r\n\r\nAs I did it long time ago, I forgot how things started and developed,
    but it's my mistake, I should have mentioned it was based on Times."
