body: I just recieved a copy of Counter Punch by Fred Smeijers. I am very excited
  about this book and have been ejoying reading it. <BR> <BR>I have found his type
  - Renard - difficult to read and was wondering if I am alone. I keep finding myself
  looking at the lower case &#39;w&#39; and hanging on it as it appears in the text.
  Also, the black color of the text is distracting for some reason. The overall feel
  I have is that the reading is choppy. <BR> <BR>I am no type expert and am not discounting
  Mr. Smeijers&#39; work. I am just wondering if others have some experience with
  Renard and some input. <BR> <BR>Thanks.

  body: Although I don&#39;t have your strange experience with the &#34;w&#34;, to
    me Renard is indeed a bit mannered. And even though I like my text a bit dark,
    I think Renard goes a bit too far. That said, one could see Renard as a mild experiment
    of sorts, and I think it&#39;s largely a successful one, so in the overall it&#39;s
    a valuable font. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    easy to read. In that sense, they both remind me of Janson. <BR> <BR>On inspection,
    yes, that w is a bit wide. <BR> <BR>But to tell the truth, these are plain typefaces
    that I didn&#39;t really notice as I was reading -- they did their job, and I
    didn&#39;t derive any extra pleasure from them.  <BR> <BR>Quadraat, however, is
    a Smeijers typeface that I sometimes find myself savouring, rereading a line of
    text. Its forms have an organic coherence and an evenly distributed personality.

    of Mr. Smeijers&#39; work, as I do not feel qualified to make a judgement of it,
    other than how I am finding myself intereacting with the type as used in the book.
    <BR> <BR>The contents of the book are amazing and I only wish I did not have to
    work a job, so that I could spend a week or two reading and re-reading Counterpunch
    and maybe even playing with some of his ideas.

    really goes beyond aesthetics&#41;. Inautheticity does two bad things: it harms
    a culture, and it reduces functionality. <BR> <BR>Interestingly, some people think

    Me? <BR> <BR>I also wondered about English and the Latin alphabet. I can see a
    strong argument for French, Italian, Spanish and Portugese to mention a few Latin-based
    languages. They, in my mind, should be best suited for the Latin alphabet - assuming
    the culture that developed the Latin alphabet did a good job of creating a symbol
    system that matched their language well. <BR> <BR>Anyway, Hrant, do you have any
    samples of Irish written with the Latin alphabet that I could look at?

    is an interesting thread <BR> <BR>Officially &#40;in other words, according to
    our beloved government&#41; dots and dodgy characters have been considered backwards
    since the 1960s and Roman <b>must</b> be used in all cases &#40;unless of course

    I&#39;m not the only one&#41;, there are a few problems with this. <BR> <BR>1.
    Does the government actually know what it&#39;s talking about ? Or did it just
    go along with the cheapy printers who wanted to eliminate the cost of maintaining
    two alphabets? And as the present government is allowing/ helping the Irish language
    to disappear, why should anyone listen to anything they say about typography?  <BR>
    <BR>2. Nobody has designed &#40;or even customised&#41; a Roman font with the
    letter frequency and general uniqueness of the Irish language in mind. It&#39;s
    all very well to say that Roman works but, to be honest, setting GAelic text with
    it can be a bloody nightmare. The very poor quality of modern gaelic typography
    is shameful.  <BR> <BR>Chris, h-es are just grand but you wouldn&#39;t believe
    how practical dots are. <BR> <BR>Check out what Vincent Morely is doing here:

    government did away with the dots and the bizarre, backward characters that were
    upsetting Ireland&#39;s printers, there were no national Gaelic language newspapers.
    Now there are two and one of them&#39;s just gone daily. Modern Irish Gaelic is
    notoriously difficult to set in justified columns because of its relatively very
    long words. Very often, you end up with two words per line with an enormous, eye-catching
    space in between. With up to 5 h-es in some common words, dots are extremely useful
    for this sort of work. <BR> <BR>All the same, because of the high &#39;h&#39;
    content, this particular letter does play a big part in  Gaelic&#39;s visual personality.  <BR>
