  for some information regarding the best open/free font to use on my ebooks.\r\n\r\nI
  have a handful of ebooks I would like to share in a mini library on my website,
  but would also like to have them available in word and plain text as well as PDF.\r\n\r\nI
  set up one of the books and layed it out to the best of my ability in Indesign,
  everything converts well to the PDF with the Minion Pro font I am using.  \r\n\r\nBut
  disaster strikes when I try to convert the file to word in Acrobat X, I have made
  sure there are no errors and that the fonts are all formatted properly.  I have
  noticed that this font is a bit funny about the conversion if the size is 12p, much
  of the other text is ruined also, super wide letters, really skinny lettering, just
  a bit mess.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if anyone has any good recommendations and
  experience with a flexible font that can handle the converts, I also tried embedding
  the fonts to no avail.\r\n\r\nI am just looking for a classic font with a roman
  flare, that is easy on the eye, and sits well in ebooks that people will spend a
  while reading, or print off. \r\n\r\nYour help in advance would be great, thanks"

  body: "Hmm. Not sure if I understand what you are trying to do here. Why are you
    converting <em>to</em> Word? Can't you just copy-paste the plain text? Can you
    perhaps show some samples of what goes wrong? \r\n\r\nAll these formats are wierd
    choices for ebooks btw. \r\n\r\nYou <em>can</em> embed fonts in Word, and from
    what I remember Adobe's fonts allow this.\r\n\r\nAs for a good libre (or commonly
    available) text serif for (mostly) reading on screen: Droid Serif, Times New Roman
    and Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    and fonts in Google Web Fonts by Cyreal. \r\n\r\nwww.google.com/webfonts\r\n\r\nAdd
    them all to your collection and then there's a download link in the top right
