    modularly. I'd say so far I've probably put about 10 hours into it.

  body: "I agree with Hrant. This needs a lot more work.\r\n\r\nTo me the basics of
    typography are proportions, balance and great detail. I understand your intent,
    but I think it's just not working. The wobbly appearance of your font keeps me
    from seeing the good elements in there.\r\nTry fixing the unbalanced curves and
    only than take it to the next level."

  body: "Hi Rian,\r\nThis is nice.\r\nI like the wide proportions, and the almost
    semi-bold weight.\r\n\r\nOf course, still needs a lot of polish here and there.\r\nHere
    are some recommendations:\r\n- In your /n and /m, the top of the curve are too
    close to the first stem. Move them to the center, or closer to the second stem.
    Also, the transition from curve to stem looks unnatural. \r\n- /m and /w are too
    wide.\r\n- Maybe you can remove the spur on the /w last stem (and, why not, also
    in the /u)\r\n- The /c has to much weight on the middle, move the outer curve
    4 or 5 units closer to the inner curve.\r\n- The ending angle on the /e and /s
    mach each other, but the /c looks like its from a different font.\r\n- The /g
    and /s are unbalanced, try to find a better balance.\r\n- The bottom curve on
    the /k need more work.\r\n- The /y descenders is to much, make it shorter.\r\n-
    The dots inside the dots doesn't make sense at small sizes\r\n- The angle cut
    on top of the /l should mach the angle of the others (/b, /d, /h, /k)\r\n- The
    /f crossbar should be shorter in the outside and larger in the inside (more like
    the one in the /t).\r\n"

    looking better, not great.  g looks a lot better, imo.  Scaled the e and o down
    vertically to facilitate solid x height and baseline better.  Started some punctuation,
    large rounded squares.  Scaled back the overhangs of f and y slightly.  Extended
    lower leg of k, and lengthened primary stroke of f.  Tightened spacing a bit (wondering
    if too much?)  Didn't like the way the 'humps' of the u and w sloped to the right,
    but the m and n sloped to the left, so centered up the humps on the w and u.  Other
    small fixes and changes unremembered...\r\n\r\nhttp://nonbookfonts.com/xtra/DetroitAFspecimen.pdf\r\n\r\nCritical

    spacing is too tight, but the proportions shall stay.  Looking at making the period
    something like 1/3 xheight.  Yes, they will be oversized, and likely, to your
    eyes, ridiculous.  I might try to proportion them up to the size of some of the
    counters.\r\n\r\nThe overhang was waaaaaay off.  Thanks for pointing that out."
