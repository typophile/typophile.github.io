    of Oxford, and Yale. So I don&#39;t want to pack again.  <BR> <BR>But thank you.

  body: sorry for bing such a jackdonkey, but that&#39;s how i learned what russian
    i know and the little spanish i have command of.  <BR> <BR>For Russian and Arabic,
    you can probably find decent books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071396748/qid=1095805481/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/104-0239347-4615163"
    target="_blank"> this one</a> in the Teach Yourself series. I have the Polish
    and Hindi books from this series, but haven&#39;t been that diligent in studying
    them. But they seem to take a good approach. I dunno where to start for Hebrew,
    Latin &amp; Greek , though. I&#39;m sure there are some good books out there for
    those ones too, but I couldn&#39;t make any recommendations.  <BR> <BR>hope that&#39;s
    of some help at least! <BR> <BR>oh, and nothing helped my russian more than living
    in St. Petersburg for 3 months, but if you don&#39;t wanna pack yer bags i guess
    that&#39;s outta the question.

  body: 'I don&#39;t know much about resources for learning those specific languages,
    but one piece of general advice I can give is that <i>sound</i> is where it is.
    Unless you&#39;re only going to use a language to read stuff &#40;which is valid
    for Latin though&#41; lean more towards hearing and speaking, rather than learning
    rules. Trust your brain to sort things out over time, &#34;naturally&#34;. For
    one thing, that will help your accent a lot. So after you lay a basic foundation
    &#40;like getting familiar with the elemental sounds of the language, and understanding
    some basic words and phrases&#41; jump right in: find a local community who speaks
    the language &#40;restaurants are always a good starting point&#41; and strike
    up conversations. Don&#39;t be self-conscious, people generally love it when you
    want to learn their language, especially when you do it with gusto, as opposed
    to using a &#34;clinical&#34; approach. <BR> <BR>For history, culture and art
    though, books and websites can be much more helpful. <BR> <BR>For type, lettering
    and calligraphy, the LCT book is a must, and then there&#39;s these specific works:
    <BR> <BR>Arabic: &#34;Arabic Script&#34; by G M Khan. <BR> <BR>Hebrew: &#34;The
    Book of Hebrew Script&#34; by A Yardeni. <BR> <BR>Greek: Nothing like the two
    above that I know of, but &#34;Greek Letters: from tablets to pixels&#34; is chock-full
    of great insight. <BR> <BR>Russian: I don&#39;t know of any, but I suspect there
    must be something decent. Adam Twardoch once pointed out a great 4-part web resource
    about Cyrillic type design, but I forget where it is. It was in Russian however
    - although an automatic online translation managed to make it 90% intelligible
    to me... and 100% entertaining! <BR> <BR>Latin: I don&#39;t think there are any.  ;-&#62;
