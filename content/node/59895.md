  I'll begin by mentioning a calligraphy-based lettering artist named Luca Barcellona.
  I stumbled upon his outstanding style via [[welovetypography.com]] - what a lovely
  little designers' distraction! The lettering styles featured in Luca's Flickr-based
  portfolio ([[http://tinyurl.com/csvkdq]]) have all found themselves in my research
  archive, while I struggle to practice a variety of methods on a daily basis. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Luca_4195.jpg]\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\r\nI
  know it probably sounds typical, but I feel a bit more than obligated to devote
  a certain amount of my time to Ooo-ing and Aww-ing  over type. Type of all kinds.
  Lettering of all kinds. I just relocated from Baltimore to Chicago, and while I
  unpacked all of my books I found myself surrounded, sitting on the floor, flipping
  through all the books that I've neglected over the past few months. \r\n\r\n95%
  of them focus on graphic design; old and new. 90% of them discuss typography. 80%
  of them were purchased online. 20% of them are annual publications. 10% of them
  were designed by Abbott Miller. Another 10% of them were edited by, or contributed
  to by Ellen Lupton. 5% of them are autographed. 3% of them are still contained in
  shrink wrap. 1% of them are never stacked upon and are contained in a plastic freezer
  bag, because I don't even trust myself around the Pentagram Bible. There is also
  a shelf-full that focus more on photography (but that's another story).\r\n\r\nWriting
  is always something I thought I would have more time for, and maybe Typophile will
  be a nice outlet for that. Looking forward to my next post!\r\n</br>"
