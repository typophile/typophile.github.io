  formats that can't be read on the PC. I am using a program called TransType (version
  3) to change the font for use with Windows. I wanted to know what is the best format
  to change the font files to? The options I have are:\r\n\r\n-Win Truetype/Opentype
  TT\r\n-Win Type 1\r\n-OpenType PS\r\n\r\nI am not sure what to change the font to
  at the moment I'm using the Opentype PS setting, As I know Opentype is multi Platform.
  I would be primarily using these fonts with Adobe CS5 programs.\r\n\r\nI use type
  a lot in my work but am quite naive to the formats and there pro and cons any help
  would be great.\r\n\r\nI have just started using Suitcase Fusion 3 (trial on Windows)
  as my Font Manager.[I am open to suggestion on a better font manager for Windows

  body: The only kinds of fonts you might need to convert would be the old-school
    Mac suitcase format (which may contain either TrueType or PostScript outlines)
    or (less likely) the dfont TrueType format. In TransType, Mac TrueType format
    fonts have an icon with a blue capital 'A,' while Postscript format fonts have
    a red lowercase 'a.' To preserve the integrity of the outlines, you'd want to
    convert Mac TrueType to Win TrueType. With PostScript, might as well go with OpenType
    PS, since it preserves the outlines and Type 1 fonts aren't supported by the newer
    WPF rendering system.

  body: Thanks Gargoyle, Yes these fonts are in the old Mac Suitcase format. Thanks
    for the heads up. Most are in Postscipt format so I'll change them to the OpenType
    PS format.

    in them, may cause errors in the conversion process. Clean m up.'
