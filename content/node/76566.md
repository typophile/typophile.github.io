body: "I thought this would be the right place to share my project:\r\n\r\nI'm working
  on a typographic wall calendar, made of two thousand and eleven keyboard keys. Last
  year I did one made of 2010 keys.(http://typophile.com/node/65810)\r\n\r\nThis year
  I turned the design into a Kickstarter project. Kickstarter is a public funding
  platform for design and art projects.\r\nHere is the link to the project-website
  with a little video: http://kck.st/20eleven\r\n\r\nI also was invited to a lengthy
  interview about my design process:\r\nhttp://blog.kickstarter.com/post/1360375408/creator-q-a-harald-geisler-of-typographical-calendar\r\n\r\nOn
  my website i wrote a bit more in depth about the piece:\r\nhttp://haraldgeisler.com/2009/12/31/typographic-keyboard-wall-calendar/\r\n\r\nAnd
  there is even a concept text and picture as downloadable PDF:\r\nhttp://2011.haraldgeisler.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Harald-Geisler-Typographic-Keyboard-Calendar.pdf\r\n\r\nI
  hope you enjoy the work. \r\nTypographic or non-typographic feedback either directly
  or through mail is welcome.\r\nSpreading the word is appreciated (since i need to
  get backers to fulfill the typographic project.)\r\n\r\nYours Sincerely,\r\nHarald

  body: "<strong>Thanks for the nice replies, and especially for the promotion to
    frontpage!</strong>\r\n\r\nThe last days(feels like months) have been busy. But
    I wanted to share the final product with everybody on Typophile, by posting some
    pictures of the production and of course the finished calendar!\r\n\r\nHere's
    the link to my Homepage with more details and background infos to the project:\r\nhttp://haraldgeisler.com/2010/12/30/2011-typographic-wall-calendar/\r\n\r\n<strong>Still
    in need for a wall calendar for next year? // Delayed Christmas/Holiday/New Year
    presents:</strong>\r\n<em>Since I like Typophile a lot (just like August), I would
    like to offer everyone who likes to get a copy of the print a <em>Typophile<em>
    discount. \r\nSimply send me a mail after purchase via PayPal, saying that you've
    read about it on Typophile and you'll get 10% off, \r\n+ And to make it exciting:
    everybody who posts a picture here in this thread of the received calendar in
    your studio or kitchen (or where you'd like to place it) and get additional 15%
    (25% in total)  )\r\n\r\nHere is the link to order prints:\r\nhttp://haraldgeisler.com/order-prints/\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
    you have extra time and a twitter or facebook acount - it would be great if you
    could share the link along your followers.\r\n\r\nThanks & a happy new year!\r\nHarald\r\n\r\n\u2193

    already bought the calendar?\r\nCan I get the discount first, and then post the
    picture. My word is my bond :)"

  body: "@Bloodtype - Good Question: I tried to find out how to setup discount codes
    with PayPal - seems impossible. It is just possible to send a part of the transfered
    money back via PayPal - that's how it normally works.\r\n\r\nIf you like to get
    the discount ahead - send me a mail to \" mail [at] haraldgeisler.com \" and I
    send you a reduced money request through paypal - (and I will nag you until you
    post the picture - you got my word on that ;) )\r\n\r\nCheers - Harald\r\n"
