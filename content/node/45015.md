body: "I recently finished both upper and lowercase letter forms for a new geometric
  sans-serif I'm working on. Similar to Gotham & Futura.\r\n\r\nI've included two
  alternate character ideas on the third line. I kind of like that Univers inspired
  Q, wasn't as fond of the R (it was just the first one I made), I think I might just
  delete it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/handgloves_3958.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  intend to complete punctuation marks, some common ligatures where they may be needed,
  then different weights\r\n\r\nLooking for tweaks to be made, specifically on some
  of the lowercase letterforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://i29.tinypic.com/21j4qvp.jpg\">view

  body: "First off, I'm not a type designer, so take what you will from my comments.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I find the pointy M and N don't match the flat A, V, and W. They look like
    they are from different typefaces.\r\n\r\nIt's weird, but as I read left to right,
    it seems like the letters have different influences from other typefaces. I see
    a little Gotham next to some Avant Garde, then some DIN.\r\n\r\nThe \"g\" looks
    like it has an underbite.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "thanks David. I think you make an especially good point about the M. Looking
    at it now, i think the pointed N works, but I feel like I should rework the M
    to flatten just the top points.\r\n\r\nIt's true the face does have a few different
    influence, mostly Gotham and Futura as I mentioned, but I don't think that's a
    bad thing. Do you?"

  body: "you're having some problems at stroke joins. take lc \"a\" for instance.
    The top and bottom joins are too heavy compared to stroke weight. Same thing woth
    \"G\". <strong>Very</strong> obvious.\r\n\r\nAny you also mix styles. Sharp tappered
    M (second version) compared to flat top A. K and R (second version) too different...
    etc."
