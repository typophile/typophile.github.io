  have a new imac intel and i am trying to install robofab but for some some reason
  i can not make python work. I probably did a mess:\r\nfirst I installed python 2.5.1.
  Then I realized that robofab needs the python 2.3.3, I installed it but it didn\xB4t
  work. So then I trashed everything and then re-installed python 2.3.3 but during
  the installation I got an error message about preferences that I should delete first
  in order to use robofab, but I can't find this preference archive.\r\nIs there any
  way of going back to the beginning?\r\n\r\nhope someone has any idea about it. thanks! "

  body: "Check and see where RoboFab's \"robofab.pth\" file was installed, it may
    have been installed in the Universal install of Python in HardDrive/Library/Frameworks/
    but since FontLab isn't a Universal Binary it is going to be using the older install
    of Python in HardDrive/Library/Python/\r\n\r\nGo ahead and copy the robofab.pth
    file to a location that looks more like this one:\r\nHardDrive/Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/robofab.pth\r\n\r\nAndy"

    recall to have followed these instructions to make it work with FL5: http://just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/RoboFab_2fFontLabStudio5"

  body: "I got it working now. What I did was just to type \"python2.3\" in the terminal
    when installing except for only \"python\". I guess it didnt want to work under
    my 2.4, and by writing python 2.3 it activates the right python when installning...
    eh... or something.\r\n\r\nI read it at the Robofab installation instruction."

  body: "Dario,\r\n\r\nI have an update, a colleague of mine was having this same
    problem and found that it was a permissions problem. Check the directory that
    it's trying to install the robofab.pth file to and see if your user has permissions
    to write there:\r\n\r\n<code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/site-packages</code>\r\n\r\nLocate
    that folder and Get Info on it and in the details at the bottom of the Info window,
    if it says that you only have read access, click the lock icon and give your user
    Read & Write access.\r\n\r\nThat'll at least get the robofab.pth file installed,
    but you may still need to copy it into the site-packages folder for an older installation
    of Python.\r\n\r\nAndy"
