body: "Hi, everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm working on understand the terrible and heavy world
  of some (and just some of them) Opentype features. And the most disturbance thing
  which I haven't understand already is the exception that makes possible to the \"end\"
  feature (in some of the Stylistic set) to work only in the last character, not in
  the middle of the word. After that, I discovered the *fina feature, I don't understand
  how it works, but it does what I was looking for. But at Myfonts.com there are just
  eight fonts with that feature, is not very common. Isn't it? Why?\r\n\r\nSo, looking
  inside other fonts, like Minion. I've seen that it doesn't use the fina feature.
  It uses a combination between classes. Just that? The \"space\" character is included
  in the class, but how it works? Where's the script that allows that?\r\n\r\nIn basic
  script some options would be (without classes)\r\n\r\nThis is what it would not
  work:\r\n\r\nfeature ss01 {\r\n     sub e by e.end;\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\nThe way that
  I've thought to work with some characters:\r\n\r\nfeature ss01 { \r\n    sub e space
  by e.end; \r\n    sub e period by e.end; \r\n    etc.\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\nObviosusly
  I'm sure that it's not the way to do it. (It would be a lot of unnecesary work)
  \r\n\r\nAny idea? \r\nThanks!"

  body: End is not an OpenType feature, it is just an suffix used in whatever example
    you saw. Minion probably uses CALT rather than FINA because <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support">only
    five applications even support FINA.</a> Doing this with CALT checks to see if
    any glyph in (class of glyphs with terminal forms) is to the left of (class of
    glyphs that are spaces or certain punctuation marks) and if so, swap in the .end
    form of the letter.

  body: "<code>fina</code> feature is generally used in Arabic and similar scripts
    and the Engines does the word analysis needed to determine where to apply it (in
    Arabic final forms can occur in the middle of the word), so it is implemented
    in the font as simple substitution lookup.\r\n\r\nSome engines (Adobe's only,
    I think) support in other scripts to mean end of the word, and the engine still
    have to do the word analysis. Some consider this an abuse as you can't then use
    it to mean end of word in Arabic which have it legitimate uses apart from the
    current use of <code>fina</code> in Arabic script, a different feature should
    have been added for that.\r\n\r\nSince the use of <code>fina</code> in Latin script
    not supported by most engines, fonts do use a bit more complex <code>calt</code>
    rules to implement it, searching typophile you should find several threads discussing
    this."

  body: If <code>fina</code> is <cite>partially</cite> supported, should we put any
    final forms in <code>ss01</code> and then call ss01 from the <code>fina</code>
    feature for full compatibility?

  body: "I wouldn\u2019t bother with stylistic sets for the purpose of compatibility
    because they are also poorly supported. And end users are usually clueless about
    how stylistic sets work. I dealt with this in a recent font by calling all positional
    forms from AALT so that they can be accessed in any application with a glyph palette.
    Of course, that does not solve the problem in crap software like Photoshop that
    has no glyph palette for using AALT, but it\u2019s all I can really do."

  body: " Thank you guys!\r\n\r\nAfter taking a look to the Adobe OT feature spec:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html\r\n\r\nI
    made classes for every alternate characters, and then use the ignore script.\r\n\r\nSomething
    like this with the swashes feature:\r\nFor example M has a swash for beginnings
    on the left. To avoid the cross with the right swash of Q in uppercase words and
    also to make M.swsh only shown in beginnings, I wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature swsh
    { # Swashes\r\n     ignore sub @allswsh @swshl01';\r\n     sub @swshr01' by @swshr02;\r\n
    \    sub @swshl01' by @swshl02;\r\n} swsh;\r\n\r\nQ is in swshr01 / Q.swsh is
    in swshr02\r\nM is in swshl.01 / M.swsh is in swshl.02\r\n\r\nWhile uppercase,
    lowercase, numbers and other characters are in allswsh class.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt works
    fine for me, some better ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n"
