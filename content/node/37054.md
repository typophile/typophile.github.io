  place to ask. Anyone have any idea what the National Media Museum logo typeface
  is?\r\n\r\nI guessed it might have been DIN but the M drops down to the baseline
  in the logo.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/images/Logo_Big.gif\">Logo
  can be found here - http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/images/Logo_Big.gif</a>\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help!"

  body: "Cool, Yea I had a hard time distinguishing it because of it's size. I ordered
    a catalog from them to see what it looks like in print. \r\n\r\nThanks for the
    suggestions Stephen! I am actually looking for the type used for an identity project
    (school related) for that museum and am writing up an outline that documents their
    current identity.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help"
