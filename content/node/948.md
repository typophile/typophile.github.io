    I cleaned, but that&#39;s not happening in the near future. It&#39;s not messy
    so much as it&#39;s just plain squalid. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/15388.jpg"

  body: After I&#39;ve cleaned it, my current studio looks remarkably similar to Nathan&#39;s
    living room &#40;perhaps we are kindred spirits&#41;. My previous studio, however,
    had another type of charm. This photo is taken from the studio, looking East toward
    Mt. Baker, at about 6:00 in the morning during Summer. The strip of red/orange
    near the bottom is Haro Strait, which separates Vancouver Island from mainland
    Washington state and the province of British Columbia. I was encouraged to send
    this in after seeing John Hudson&#39;s beautiful studio view. No aeron chair,
    no apples, but loads of inspiration. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/15398.jpg"

    interested in precedents, you might like to look at Oxford/Monticello and ATF
    Clearface &#40;the original metal, not the later ITC version&#41; for that extremely
    rare feature. In comparison, the Baskerville and Kelper forms are almost apologetic.

    the Latin alphabet as a whole. </i> <BR> <BR>When I am deciding, if a g should
    have an open bowl or not, this depends on the design. I am more a subjective designer
    than a theoritical one.  <BR> <BR>For example, I would probably prefer a closed
    bowl for a design, based on expansion strokes. But that depends on the given problem,
    for which the face is being made. Like sometimes making an italic g in a roman
    face is the better solution. <BR> <BR>--Jacques
