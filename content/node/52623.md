  specimen or sample sheet and then apply it automatically to many fonts to generate
  a sample book or printing/PDF.\r\n\r\nI've tried a few, the best I've found so far
  is FontCat. However it doesn't seem to be able to provide the ability to mix styles
  from one font on the same page, not to mention that on my mac at least it is unstable
  and crashes randomly.\r\n\r\nFor example the Univers font has many, many weights
  and widths. I don't want to print out a new sheet for each style of that family.
  I want to make a single page sample sheet that shows me what the five main weights/widths
  are like in different sizes.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations or advice on this subject
  would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks"
