body: "Hello, I've been working on some custom lettering that could potentially be
  used for our agency's corporate identity (if it turns out good enough). I'm at the
  point where I've been tweaking it and staring at it way too long, and can't tell
  what's working and what's not. Any feedback on overall balance, consistency, weight,
  color, etc. would be much appreciated. I'm not a type designer, so please don't
  omit any obvious issues!\r\n\r\n(Don't pay any mind to the words themselves. They
  are just randomly chosen so I'm not showing everyone who I work for.)\r\n\r\n-Ed"

  body: "This is looking nice \u2014 only a couple things that stick out to me:\r\n\r\n\u2013The
    right leg of the 'R' seems like it should slide back toward the stem a bit; its
    stance feels rather wide.\r\n\r\n\u2013The 'M' feels quite wide; there's a big
    hole of white space in the central valley. I want to pinch the two sides in toward
    the center."

  body: '^ yes, but don''t narrow the entire /M/, just squeeze the "V" in its middle
    closed a bit (the horizontals at the top vertices will lengthen and the corners
    of the side counters will rise). '

  body: "Thanks for the feedback! I knew there was something off with the /M/. I first
    tried narrowing the entire letter, which, as eliason pointed out, wasn't the correct
    solution. Proportionally, I believe the /M/ should be about 120-130% wider than
    the /D/ or /E/. I'll have to try closing up the \"V\" in the middle, as you said.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the /R/, I typically like a wider stance, but that's just my preference. I'm planning
    on doing a bit of customization to a few of the letters after I get the general
    forms designed (once they are in the context of the logo) -- one of which may
    help out the /R/."

    the terminals of the \"C\" horizontal, for better match with the \"M\".\r\n\r\nPublish
    complete character set for more."

  body: "Thanks, Alexander. I'll give that a try. I was trying to stay away from anything
    that would make it resemble Eurostile, but maybe the /C/ seems forced.\r\n\r\nI'd
    like to do a complete character set, however I don't think I have the talent and/or
    patience. Just thinking about trying to design a nice two-story lowercase /a/
    drives me insane."

  body: "Nice one, \"industrial superellipe design with nice quirks\".\r\n\r\nFirst
    of all i must say i'm no type designer at all!\r\nI really do like the existing
    C, M, A, E \u2013 but don't like the R (something should be changed).\r\nThe legibility
    of the D could cause problems, if it's shown small (I resized your sample with
    PS to watch it smallish).\r\n\r\nRegards T."

  body: Good stuff so far! Have you considered making the curve of the /D/ more consistent
    with that of the /C/ and /R/? It would balance it better as a letter I think for
    it to be slightly rounder.

  body: Sorry if this is dredging up an old topic. Things got crazy with actual paying
    client work and this internal project fell by the wayside. I'm hoping to revive
    it soon though and wanted to thank everyone for their input. I'll be considering
    it as I move forward.
