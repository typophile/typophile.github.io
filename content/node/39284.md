body: "Hey guys\r\n\r\nI need your opinion. I am currently in the process of completing
  a booklet. It contains mainly photos and illustrations, with some text explaining
  the photos and legends for my illustrations.\r\n\r\nMost pages contain a headline,
  which I've set in \"Bliss Pro Extra Bold\", size: 23pt, leading: 18pt.\r\n\r\nThe
  text is set in \"Vista Sans Book\", size: 10pt, leading: 12pt.\r\n\r\nAll settings
  in InDesign.\r\n\r\nI'm no professional in type, but you are ;-) - what do you think?
  I've experimented with \"Agenda\" for my headlines but found it to be too strict
  and too strong a contrast to my illustrations which mostly consist of natural shapes...
  I've also tried \"The Sans\" for the text (I guess it's a faux pas to set small
  text in TheSans anyway) and although I like the typeface itself, I found it kinda
  hard to read.\r\n\r\nI want the text to look modern and contemporary but not soulless.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think - it's not another Gill/Frutiger booklet ;-)\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\njan"
