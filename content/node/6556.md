  body: yeah, a good book is &#34;hey whipple, squeeze this&#34; or something similar.
    By a famous ad man, but don&#39;t let that put you off. Very good read, excellent
    tips for &#34;books&#34;. Pretty much says that there is nothing better than excellent
    work. But read it for yourself. Helped me a lot.

  body: 'In my portfolio I designed on 2000 I used a spread <BR>for each work/research;
    the semi off-topic text <BR>on the right, and the related images on the left.
    <BR>I used A4 as spread, for economical reason. <BR>The book has been binded with
    hard cover, <BR>my name and the title &#34;Antologia Grafica&#34; <BR>letterpressed
    with Quirinus, silver on dark blue. <BR>To design it, I read the application for
    UIAH, <BR>&#40;<a href="http://www.uiah.fi" target="_blank">http://www.uiah.fi</a>&#41;
    that is why I designed it, <BR>to study in Finland. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>AS <BR>
