  for a tv studio, but they're looking for a graphic designer, so I assume its all
  print.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid to ask what this is, but I'm not entirely sure.\r\n\r\ncan
  anyone explain what it might entail?\r\n\r\nthanks"

    that, I'm thinking one can figure out what reformatting a pitch might entail...
    but I don't think it would be bad to ask.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Well, I would *think* it's safe to assume that in this case, the pitch would
    not be verbal. But it might also mean taking a verbal pitch and turning it into
    a visual one! Which is why it might be good to have a dialog about what the input
    and expected output of your work might be. Why not simply ask for an example of
    something in both input and output formats? Preferably the same pitch, but even
    one pitch in \"input\" format (the kind of thing you're supposed to fix) and a
    different one in \"output\" format (the kind of thing you're supposed to deliver)
    would be helpful.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I'd second Tom's suggestion. Ask for the "template" and before/after examples.
    Who knows they may want you to reformat using a "bad" font. :-)

  body: "I must say this sounds like fun because of all the wacky material you'll
    get to read. I can just imagine some of the pitches now:\r\n\r\n\"It's like 'Lolita'
    meets 'E.T.'!\"\r\n\r\n\"This would be the perfect vehicle for a Tom Green or
    Sylvester Stallone type.\"\r\n\r\n\"Imagine 'Henry V' crossed with 'Snow White'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tarantino
    directing a Merchant Ivory production! What's not to like?\"\r\n\r\nHmmm, all
    that actually gets me thinking. What about a Quentin Tarantino \"Macbeth\"?\r\n\r\nT"
