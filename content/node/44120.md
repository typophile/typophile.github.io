  Non of PStyles have underline checked in. Any idea, what went wrong here?"

  body: "I only have CS2, but it should be the same. Click on the problem paragraph.
    If there is an asterisk next to the PStyle name, that means something is over
    riding it. Click on the triangle near the top of the palette. A pop-up menu should
    appear. Select Clear Overrides.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, check to the actual PStyle to
    see if what, if any, Chararcter Styles are applied to it. If there are, then check
    those CStyles.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid"
