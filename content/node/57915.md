body: "I'm working on my PhD thesis and it struck me that I have been using Times
  New Roman for years without ever questioning the almighty manuals that most brazilian
  academics follow. Most ABNT (the brazilian ISO or DIN) manuals say that fonts must
  be either Arial or Times New Roman, but I'm willing to break this rule.\r\n\r\nAfter
  considering using a typewriter or a DOS font, I began more serious research on what
  substitutes could I use to make my text look exciting and smart.\r\n\r\nI started
  to research the subject and discovered that Yale solved the problem in a very simple
  way: they designed their own typeface:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.yale.edu/universityprinter/typeface/\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to ask you all for more sugestions on what typefaces could be used for a PhD
  thesis, and if you know the rules used my other universities. Maybe even what faces
  were used in certain famous works, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDan"

    preferred\" but not required.  In the end though, I just submitted it in Times
    for the university purposes and made my own copy to be bound to test my own Coru\xF1a.\r\n\r\nRemember,
    a dissertation will (most likely) eventually be published, so unless it's a design
    or art-related one, I personally wouldn't worry too much about it (I know, I know,
    blasphemy on this forum)"

  body: "It is a mistake to think there is an \"academic look.\" Different typefaces
    work well with different subjects. Even in your field, (Cinema?), I would choose
    different fonts depending on the subject. For example, if your thesis is \"Romantic
    Comedies starring Doris Day,\" it would likely get a different font than \"Film
    Noir, 1955-60.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Times Roman, It too has appropriate and inappropriate
    uses, though today, it seems few think it has any appropriate uses.\r\n\r\nI think
    it is decried for two reasons. The first is it is used a lot, and boredom sets
    in \"The Designer's Bored and the Reader Pays\" might make a good dissertation
    topic. The second and more important reason is the font hasn't moved gracefully
    from metal to photocomp and digital. Probably because everybody who's capable
    is bored with it."

  body: "Thank you all very much for your input. I printed test pages of around 30
    fonts to compare them, and will add Andron and Skolar to the tests.\r\n\r\nBut
    so far I'm sticking to Palatino. First of all because I prefer my text to be in
    serifs, both for faster reading, and also to make it look \"old school\". Besides,
    when compared with the other serif fonts I chose, it was the only one that looked
    slightly wider. Times New Roman printed in size 12 looks a bit thin to me: the
    thinner lines almost vanish.\r\n\r\nI was amazed to see how much different the
    line space differed from face to face. Even among fonts of the same foundry: Adobe
    Jenson looked way more compact than Adobe Caslon, even tho both showed the same
    line width.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks all again for the tips."

  body: Well readability is or course important, but for academical texts it's also
    necessary that the typeface has certain specific characters -- at least in my
    opinion -- to name one example, superscript digits from 0 to 9 (and not only 123,
    like lots of typefaces) for footnotes. But preferably also optical sizes, so you
    can use a proper optical size font for footnotes at 6 to 8 points or so. Since
    these kind of texts potentially contain lots of numbers, like years and dates,
    old style figures would also be nice. But also tabular figures for things like
    tables.

    atrocious. Don't double-space after punctuation (if that's how you learned to

    spaces for indents, etc. Learn to use the paragraph formats pane, and make adjustments

    typography from Word requires twice the effort one needs to expend if one works
    in XPress or InDesign. And most Word users don\u2019t or won\u2019t expend the
    effort; instead of setting a tab in the required location, they\u2019ll just hit
    <em>tab, tab, tab, tab</em>, until they arrive in the approximate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAnd
    people like bowerbird (e-book posts) seem to value content above all else; he

    your thoughts into a single bottomless page that Word offers (much like an ancient

    the whole thing properly.\r\n\r\nBut most important of all, it helps you manage

    You should check your department rules (which might not follow ABNT). Actually,
    I learned that ABNT rules even accept numbered citations (which most people in
    Brazil don't even know). The choice you have to make is if you want to use free/opensource
    fonts or commercial ones, or if you will use a real typesetting software (like
    InDesign or Latex) or Word. I use latex with Xetex (for fonts) and the ABNT package,
    which does all the dirty formatting work for me (biblio, citations, quotes, front
    page, etc.), and so far I've been trying Arno Pro for text and Hypatia Sans Pro
    for titles, with good results."
