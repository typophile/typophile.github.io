  body: The headline refers to Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, who in November
    of 1975 chose not to run for reelection as President Gerald Ford's running mate
    in the 1976 US presidential election. (Ronald Reagan was governor of California
    from 1967 to 1975, and he ran against Ford in the 1976 Republican primaries.)
    Oh, and the font is Kabel Heavy, horizontally compressed. In 1975, it was most
    likely done in Photolettering.

  body: "Thank you Mojo. I thought of Kabel, because of the \"R\", \"C\" and \"E\".
    But \"Y\", \"S\" and \"e\" look quite different to Kabel Heavy. Kabel Black has
    similar proportions in \"S\" and \"Y\". Does anyone know of a special version
    of Kabel Heavy?\r\n\r\nSince you know the political context of the headline, maybe
    you know as well the newspaper that used the font? I took the screenshot from
    Errol Morris documentary \"The unknonwn known\" where he often layers microfilm
    headlines over the images. There are more passages where the font can be seen,
    so i assume they must have taken them from a quite bit national/international
    newspaper.\r\n\r\nDpane, which duplicate do you mean? The entry on http://typophile.com/node/3673
    that goes to Tempo? I cannot see the original image, plus Tempo seems not right
    either.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KabelRocky_4243.jpg]\r\nRolf, this is
    a rough approximation of what was done, using a screen capture of a modern digital
    Kabel Heavy and compressing the width to 75%. In the 1975 headline, some characters
    (for example, the <strong>O</strong>) are more compressed than others, but since
    headlines set on a Visual Graphics Phototypositor were manually imaged one character
    at a time, it would have been possible for someone to adjust the width of the
    characters individually. There are some differences between the modern digital
    version and the sample (the stroke ends on <strong>C</strong> and <strong>S</strong>,
    the bowls on <strong>R</strong> and <strong>P</strong>, the apostrophe), but those
    may be variations between the old Photolettering design and the new digital design.
    \r\nI\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t know any more about the source of the headline
    in the documentary."
