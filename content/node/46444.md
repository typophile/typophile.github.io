    planets corresponding to elements, processes, chemicals etc.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol\r\nhttp://www.iridius.info/current/info/alchemy-alpha.html\r\n\r\nObviously,
    these started out with a practical purpose, and became more 'mystical' as the
    scientific bits of alchemy split away into chemistry, astronomy, etc. The planetary
    symbols are still occasionally used in astronomy."
