  and/or from the hispanic community in the US).\r\nA client wants to make a book
  on artists of color, and the whole project is very conscious about that topic. (Un)fortunately,
  I have never ever paid attention to the font designers\u2019 color up til now \u2026\_(not
  much of a debate over here in Europe). But in this case I have to be prepared to
  be asked about these things or to present alternative font choices from font designers
  of color.\r\nAll hints are welcome!\r\nCheers"

    attention, correct a media presence that is dominated by \"whites\", make them
    stand out in their individual brilliance, give them a stage, provide a space where
    they can discuss about what it means being \"of color\" \u2026 That\u2019s as
    far as I understand the briefing."

  body: "Thank you for the clarification. Since I favor collectivism over individualism,
    and feel that Design is about helping others and not designers themselves, I'll
    have to pass. But good luck to you in any case.\r\n\r\nBTW if you asked me for
    type designers of Armenian descent, I would adopt the same stance. But if you
    asked me for people who design fonts for the Armenian culture, I would trip over
    myself to help."

    can help suss that out.\r\n\r\nBTW let's keep this discussion going!"
