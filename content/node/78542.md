body: "I need to automate the creation of a 16-bit font file. Each glyph is available
  as a PNG or SVG file.  I can reconvert to PS if needed.\r\n\r\nWe have released
  the 16-bit file based font under the Open Font License: ISWA 2010.  I have 37,811
  glyphs with codepoints from 1 to 62,504.\r\nhttp://www.signbank.org/iswa\r\nhttp://www.signbank.org/iswa.zip\r\n\r\nEach
  glyph is available as an individual PNG or SVG file.  Each glyph has a unique codepoint.
  \ Not all codepoints are assigned.  The glyphs do not share a common height or width.
  \ The glyphs should always be displayed left then top.  The glyphs do not rotate
  or morph.\r\n\r\nThe character map should be automated from a few simple rules.
  \ There is one formula for a sequence of 3 characters and an algorithm for individual
  characters.  The characters are proposed for plane 1 of the UCS.\r\nhttp://www.signpuddle.net/plaintext\r\nhttp://www.signpuddle.net/plaintext.zip\r\n\r\nIs
  this possible to automate?  Anyone have a suggested process flow with command line
  tools or custom programs? \r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any advice on an individual, company,
  or software package that could help me get this done quick.\r\n\r\nI need a version
  that will work with the proposed Unicode characters and display the correct glyph
  rather than the empty block characters."

  body: "Sign <em>writing</em> -- the literate pendant of sign language? I have worked
    with Hamnosys, and I wasn't duly impressed. Sure, single hand signals translate
    great to static single images of a hand & fingers in a certain configuration,
    but to add <em>movement</em> I had to coax various \"accents\" in place over the
    images. What a drag.\r\n(Besides, this also seem to cater for non-manual signs:
    nose wiggles, eye blinks, smileys. Everything to make a story lively, I guess.)\r\n\r\nIt
    seems you have a set of <em>glyphs</em> and associated <em>Unicode codepoints</em>
    to store them in. Is your target a Unicode compliant font, where entering the
    Unicode, through software that supports this, yields the correct character?\r\nIn
    that case, all that's needed is a (relatively) easy font creating software, where
    you can import your images into, assign arbitrary codepoints, and save as an OTF
    or TTF. I <em>do</em> know that you should stick to vector files -- no PNGs. I'm
    not sure about SVGs -- perhaps these can be imported or copied into the regular
    software, perhaps not. (With FontLab, I've read here, you can copy/paste from
    Illustrator.)\r\n\r\nSince it looks like you're not after heavy-duty Opentype
    features, you could try FontForge (which is free, so it's easily tried; but it
    has a steep learning curve), or FontLab's beginner's package <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/\">TypeTool</a>.\r\n\r\nIf
    there is any way of converting your outline data to another format, you could
    look into <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/\">TTF</a> -- this
    is based around a human-readable XML format, but (downside) it needs the actual
    outlines to conform to standard font outline formats -- Type 1 or Truetype."

    the glyph names are "uniXXXX" and for 5-digit Unicodes "uXXXXX" where XXXX(X)
    is the hexadecimal Unicode codepoint written using uppercase hex digits (but "uni"
    and "u" need to be lowercase), then the tools should automatically build a correct
    character map for you. '

  body: "There are two sets of commandline tools that come to mind: \r\n* FontForge
    [1]\r\n* Adobe FDK for OpenType (AFDKO) [2] combined with ufo2fdk [3] and the
    UFO format [4]\r\n\r\nThe easiest path would probably be to construct an SVG Font
    [5] and then convert it into OpenType (OTF or TTF) using FontForge. Another approach
    would be to convert the SVG drawings into the UFO format (which is a simple, high-level
    XML-based format for font data representation), and then use ufo2fdk and AFDKO
    to build an OpenType (OTF) font. FontForge can also be used to convert UFO into
    OpenType (OTF or TTF). \r\n\r\nFontForge can be run on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
    AFDKO can be run natively on Mac OS X and Windows, it can also be run on Linux
    using WINE. \r\n\r\n[1] http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/\r\n[2] http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html\r\n[3]
