body: "Hello. I have a friend in Spain that started working for a new company there
  called Ip2-TV\r\nwhich provides broadband services, telephone service and cable.
  She suggested I help them\r\nby providing a visual / creative analysis of their
  branding and I thought perhaps posting the\r\ncurrent logo here could be a good
  start. The work that is posted was created by their designer\r\nin Spain, whose
  name I do not know. \r\nA thorough honest critique would be much appreciated.\r\nLinked
  are two versions of their logo.  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ip2-TV-Logo_6640.jpg]\r\n\r\nole"

  body: "The orbital swoosh (I forget the technical term) is really out-of-date and
    cliche. The mouse on the end doesn't help either. I'm not sure I get the symbolism
    of the two interlocking TV screens - it would be clever if they spelled out the
    name of the company, but I can't see anything in them. What are they supposed
    to represent?\r\n\r\nOverall, the logo looks very \"Year 2000\".\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I never even thought of that, but you may be right. I'd say it's redundant,
    as the TV screens already signify \"TV\". Also, if this is the case, the stem
    of the 'T' isn't centred properly.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
