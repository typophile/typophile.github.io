body: "I have just released  the Hebrew Font Shuneet Version 2.0\r\nwhich now includes
  a family of different weights. These are Shuneet Light, Shuneet Thin, Shuneet Book,
  Shuneet Normal, Shuneet Demi and Shuneet Heavy. Each has a matching set of Latin
  and numeric characters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hebrew_font_shuneet_v2_face_of_the_waters_589x330_5097.jpg]\r\n\r\nThere
  has been some discussion in this forum as to what 'matching' should mean in this
  context.  I take it to mean that a block of Hebrew text and a block of English text
  should look well together.  Also foreign words or sentences embedded in a block
  of Hebrew text should not detract from the appearance of the Hebrew.\r\n\r\nI have
  also worked on improving the fonts that were included in Shuneet Version 1.0 with
  the goal of making achieving greater family harmony.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hebrew_font_shuneet_v2_499x585_4879.jpg]\r\n\r\n
  \ Take a look at my web site :  [[http://hebrew-font-shuneet.com/]] where there
  are many examples.\r\n\r\nThese fonts are available for free download.\r\n\r\nMike"

    body: "The matching Latin fonts are in the same files as the Hebrew.  I have designed
      the Latin so that it looks 'just like Latin font should' but at the same time
      does not clash with the Hebrew.  For instance I toned down the vertical emphasis
      that most Latin has. However I avoided any 'faux' Hebrew shapes.\r\nMike"

  body: The Latin seems a little lighter than the Hebrew. It's also much more rounded
    than the Hebrew. Perhaps a more technical and angular latin would be a better
    compliment to it.

    wondering why. \r\n\r\nPrevious versions were shared with a CC-BY-SA license.
    According to your site, the new license you chose to distribute with your font

    body: Were you able to look into this yet, Mike? On your site, it still says the
      new version of the fonts are shared with a CC-BY-NC-ND license -- the most restrictive
      Creative Commons license there is. I remain hopeful for good news that your
      Unicode Hebrew fonts will be shared with a free/libre and open source license
      like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL%2BFE">GPL+FE</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIL_Open_Font_License">SIL
      open font</a> license.

  body: "Michael,\r\n\r\nShuneet is very good, but the English still doesn't match
    it yet, not in weight, but in design. Notice how the Hebrew has many diagonal
    elements, but the English is more block-like, with only vertical and horizontal
    strokes.\r\n\r\nIs the name 'Shuneet' from 'm'shuneh'. different?"

  body: "As you requested, Hrant, here are a couple of parallel texts  with Hebrew
    and Latin.  Note that I have assumed that the purpose of using the Hebrew Font
    Shuneet is to present the Hebrew text and that the other text is of less importance.
    \r\n\r\nIn many fonts, such side by side presentation would have the English dominate
    simply because of the shape of the letters - the English having more verticals
    and more complex shapes.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hebrew_font_shuneet_v2_feeding_street_cats_684x153_4327.jpg]\r\nThe

  body: "Shuneet is my wife's name. Hebrew for coral.\r\n\r\nMy goal with the Latin
    and Hebrew is that they should coexist.  As it a Hebrew font with merely a matching
    Latin, I have the Hebrew dominate.  The Latin is a little lighter and to reduce
    the visual impact of the verticals, some of them are tilted slightly.\r\n\r\nThere
    is still a lot to do!\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n"
