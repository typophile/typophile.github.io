  body: "Hi Ina, \r\n\r\nI think the closest you can come in the Adobe Font Folio
    is Myriad Semi Condensed. A little further away is Frutiger. \r\n\r\nA couple
    other thoughts could be Din Mittelschrift if you want to focus on the industrial
    road signage concept. I also have to suggest Trade Gothic because it's the only
    Font Folio sans-serif I like. \r\n\r\n "
