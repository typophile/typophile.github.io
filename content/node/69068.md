  It is still very much a work in progress, and is intended to copy Aspen Magazine
  - the Minimalism Issue, 1969. I have attached two images of it.\r\n\r\nI chose to
  go with Franklin Gothic: Franklin Gothic Condensed medium for headings, and Franklin
  Gothic Book for the bread. I usually try to match sans serifs with serifs, but want
  to this time get as close to the original as I can. I also tried a version where
  I had Franklin Gothic Condensed for bread and heading. Attaching images of both.
  Is it too boring? \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I am on the wrong path! Thank you!\r\n\r\nSara"

    Yes, that is the Aspen issue! \r\n\r\nHere are 4 of my pages. I am curious about
    what typeface is in the original and if my design passes as an almost copy (and

  body: Sara, do you have any images or scans of the original Aspen no. 5+6? It's
    impossible to match the typeface based on what is on UbuWeb.
