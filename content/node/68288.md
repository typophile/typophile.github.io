  body: "It's what I would class as a Bauhaus-style font, of the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces4.html|Oblong
    kind]]. Tantalus, with its alternate (from T-26), is sort of similar, but there
    are differences. Your sample's 'a' could have been made from the Tantalus 'o'(almost),
    but still the s and r are not the same in either face. I suppose it might be a
    customization of Tantalus, but more likely it's a new font I haven't met yet.\r\n\r\n-
