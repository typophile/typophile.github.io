  from http://www.maxwanger.com/\r\n\r\nLooks a bit like Arial Rounded MT Bold but
  a touch sharper.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm here, the reason I'm asking is I'm looking for
  a similar soft, light to medium in colour typeface to set a page of prose (550 words)
  in next to a lomo picture of Max Wanger-like style. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions? I think
  Din is ok for its lightness but is lacking in character; so far nothing has been
  hitting the mark.\r\n\r\nTa,\r\nSteph :)"
