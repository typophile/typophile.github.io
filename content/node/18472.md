  and thinking of setting it in Aldus. The character and the feel is good but the
  whole thing seems a little tight. Of course it's less efficient than setting in
  Bembo for example but the book isn't really heavy, like a novel, it's more illustrative.
  I may have to track it out a little to get a better flow. Yes I've looked at Palatino
  light but I hate it.\r\n\r\nAnyone had experience in using vast amounts of Aldus?\r\n\r\nThanks,
  James."

  body: I think that taut, textured look is what Aldus is for; it's much my favourite
    Zapf type, remarkably successful, unusual and subtle, and I recently read a whole
    Divine Comedy of it with pleasure. But MT Dante is more cheerful and civilised,
    if that's what you'd prefer.

    this purpose. The craft and ruthelss lookng cut in Aldus seems appropriate. So
    if it's easy enough to read like you said, I might stick.\r\n\r\nThanks guys."

  body: Yeah thanks William. They've opened it some and given it a shave... but as
    a result they've cut the ascenders! I can't seem to win on this one.

  body: I agree that the short ascenders seem a disaster - can you not just lengthen
    them yourself? Presumably Aldus Nova's proportions had to match Palatino Nova's.

    ascenders are bad, actually try them at the intended size. Seeing stuff on screen
    can be very misleading as to how it will work at small size. '

  body: Fair enough, but the old ascenders were such an important part of the face,
    nicely counteracting the characteristic vulgarity of the Zapf look. Perhaps I'm
    not a suitable judge, not being a fan of his own favourite, Optima. And Aldus
    Nova does seem better made than its predecessor in all other respects, really
    superbly shiny and convincing.

  body: "mmm... seems sensible to match the Aldus \u2014 Palatino proportions for
    the Nova range doesn't it. But I'm looking to use my Palatino for titling. As
    well as giving a nod to authenticity it offers a subtle difference against the
    text without being a world apart or stepping too close, I like the differences
    between the two.\r\nGranted, Palatino Nova looks nice in print, but I think the
    way they are brought closer together with Nova wouldn't work for me.\r\nAs for
    lengthening the ascenders myself... it's a time issue, the 'f' would be especially
    difficult.\r\n\r\nAm I arguing myself into a corner here."

    found that combinations such as s-a and p-o, etc., needed opening up.\r\nThat
    relieved the tightness which you spoke of.\r\nThe problem was that the bowls were
    too narrow and squarish to be fitted so tight.\r\nPalatino was the corporate face
    I had to work with. Aldus was my cheat for text, I used Palatino for Bold, and
    display. If I were doing the same job now, and had free rein, I would use a contemporary
    face. Seria, perhaps, has a similar cut and proportion.\r\n"
