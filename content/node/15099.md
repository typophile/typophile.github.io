  are your opinions? Ive never had to do a logo like this before.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nS"

    Its distracting. I think your next step is to try the designs within the context
    of how they will be used and see if they still hold up. '

  body: "i sorta like the third option. seems more balanced than the other two. the
    drop shadowy effect distracts me from the delicate nature of the word head in
    the face you chose and almost verges on looking like a bad accident you might
    not have caught.\r\n\r\nmy only suggestions would be try rounding the inner boxes
    of the h inside the main green box to matach the corner radius and keep consistent
    with the curvature of the edges\r\n\r\nbtw, what is this for?\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: "Stephen, it's a good start.\r\nThe weight difference between \"head\" and
    \"way\" are very close and on the drop shadow versions difficult to see. I'm not
    sure of the company or their intent, but the word-play should make sense.\r\n\"Headway\"
    has a positive sense of making progress, and \"Head Way\" either connotes cerebral
    activity or a brand of headphones or hats.\r\n\r\nAlso, try treating the \"y\"
    as if you rotated the \"h\" 180\xB0. That way the design looks completely symetrical
    with the \"d\" as centerpoint. Lose that little sliver of white between the stems
    of the drop shadow \"h\" since it is too thin and becomes bothersome.  Good luck.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm making headway!"

  body: "It is of the genre, which can be viewed as positive or negative. It really
    depends on the reaction/or initial brief of the client. Personally I find the
    familiarity breeding indifference, further, I don't find the icons add to the
    type or to the identity of the club. Sorry this is negative and the client might
    be of the opinion that the genericism is what they\u2019re looking for and the
    fact is I don't have any immediate solution to offer. Let us see any further evolutions.\r\nTim\r\n\r\nbtw

    the Headway web site, I think you might try another approach. The severity of
    the subject and the degree of professionalism they should portray may require
