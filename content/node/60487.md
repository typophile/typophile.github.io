body: "Hey there!\r\nWell, I'm new here so maybe I should introduce myself.\r\nMy
  name's Filip \u0141ysyszyn and I'm young <em>(typo)graphic designer wanna-be</em>
  from Warsaw, Poland. I'm not a design/art student (I study english philology).\r\nI've
  recently started working on a new typeface that I hope to be my first \"serious\"
  one. However, I'm still very unexperienced and I really would appreciate professionals
  help (that means you, guys). \r\n\r\nSo, let's get it on:\r\nThe typeface name is
  July, probably because I started it in July.\r\nIt's meant to be a roman type with
  rather big aperture, small contrast and strong but short sherifs.\r\nThese weird
  acutes you see are a polish diacritics \"kreska\". These strange accents in \"a\"
  and \"e\" are again polish diacritics called \"ogonek\". The \"l\" with a diagonal
  line in the middle is a polish letter \"\u0142\" (lslash).\r\nI haven't put it in
  a font file yet, because some glyphs need corrections - that's why I can't show
  it in a paragraph here.\r\n\r\n<strong>Work In Progress Specimen:</strong>\r\nhttp://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen01.png\r\nhttp://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen02.png
  - lowercase\r\nhttp://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen03.png - uppercase\r\nhttp://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen04.png
  - small caps\r\nhttp://lysyszyn.pl/projects/specimen05.png - ligatures\r\n\r\n<strong>PDF
  PREVIEW</strong>\r\nhttp://lysyszyn.pl/projects/preview.pdf\r\n\r\nAgain, I would
  appreciate any help and critique!\r\nYour's sincerely,\r\nFilip \u0141ysyszyn\r\n\r\nPS.
  If I violated any rule of etiquete around here, please forgive and let me know."

  body: "Hi Filip,\r\n\r\nYour typeface has a nice feeling I think. Congratulations!\r\nIt's
    hard to look at the details in these images - you should rather upload some pdf
    samples. Don't use colors or any effects in the samples, keep them simple, black
    and white.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nice work. This has appealing character, and I especially like the ligatures.\r\n\r\nYou
    should definitely move it to a font design program so you can evaluate it in more
    settings. Once you do that, here are some questions I would ask:\r\n- Is the top
    of 'c', 'q' too light? 'C'?\r\n- Are the lumps of 'm' too pointy? 'n'?\r\n- Do
    the 'f's in the 'ff' ligature match well?\r\n- Is the transition from thick to
    thin in 'S'/'s' too abrupt?\r\n- Is 'N' too narrow? 'M'?\r\n- Is 'J' off balance?\r\n-
    Is the space under 'Q's tail within the bowl serving well at target sizes?\r\n-
    Are some of the small caps too dark (for example 'M')?\r\n- Should the right foot
    serifs of 'f' and 'r' be extended to help balance the letters?\r\n\r\nHope that
    helps."
