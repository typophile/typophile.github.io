  body: "What is the intended use of the font?\r\n\r\nUnless technical limitations
    require a single font to support all scripts and languages (for example in an
    interface font), the best and really the only solution is to match different fonts
    for each of the scripts.\r\n\r\nEnglish and Turkish use the Latin script, as does
    Somali nowadays. Arabic and Urdu use the Arabic script, although they are usually
    written in different styles (Nasta'liq for Urdu, Naskh for Arabic).\r\n\r\nThe
    Somali Latin alphabet doesn't seem to require special diacritics, so I would say
    you need a Latin design that supports the Turkish characters (\xE7, \u011F, \u0131,
    \xF6, \u015F, \xFC) and Arabic designs for the Arabic and Urdu languages that
    are compatible with each other. Then you'd be set.\r\n\r\nThe Latin and Arabic
    scripts have different metric requirements and are written in different directions,
    so there really is no reason for you to use a single font to support them both.
    In fact you really shouldn't use a single font for both. I'm sure other Typophiles
    will point you to some good Arabic-Latin combinations, but even those combinations
    that are designed to work together side by side in multi-script settings usually
    come in different fonts, as far as I am aware."

    be safe bets on both Mac OS and Windows. Of course supporting a language doesn''t
    necessarily mean native-readers like reading them.  '

    only ONE font that supports all the languages is that I want the different languages
    to look the same - and have the same feel. It's for a magasin that comes in five
    different languages, so they should look similar.\r\n\r\nThanx again\r\nJsbr"
