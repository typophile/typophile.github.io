  superiority effect]] (WSE).\r\n\r\nI have noticed facebook and other sites are starting
  to use real words more often (as opposed to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoword|pseudowords]]
  &c.) thus making them significantly easier to recognize. Does anyone know if this
  is on purpose?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Using words do make it easier for people to solve the CAPTCHA, but it also
    makes it much easier for a computer program to solve. Using words is a terrible
    idea if a site is trying to stop frequent attacks from computer programs, but
    probably just fine if the site isn\u2019t expecting someone to write custom programs
    to break your CAPTCHA.\r\n\r\nI worked on a project where we investigated how
    to build a CAPTCHA that would be recognizable by people, but not by computer programs.\r\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kumarc/pubs/chellapilla_chi05.pdf\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    computer programs recognize single characters at a higher rate than people. To
    build an effective CAPTCHA you need to make it difficult for the computer program
    to segment the location of each of the characters.\r\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kumarc/pubs/chellapilla_ceas05.pdf\r\n"

    of using scanned texts, so that the decoding can not only verify a human reader,
    but also as a side effect advance the deciphering of scans. See [[http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html|this

    trivially and guarantee a site becomes inaccessible to blind people.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a general trend toward asking mild skill-testing questions instead (\u201CIs
    fire hot or cold?\u201D), though this does not solve the problem of hiring Third
    World workers to solve CAPTCH\xC6 en masse. It is somewhat amazing we\u2019re
    still using these relics.\r\n\r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe Clark\r\nhttp://joeclark.org/"

    attack, where people would answer a CAPTCHA in order to access free porn. While
    this kind of attack on CAPTCHAs is frequently discussed, no one seems to know
    of this actually happening. Real attacks do come from computer programs that try
    to recognize CAPTCHAs.\r\n"
