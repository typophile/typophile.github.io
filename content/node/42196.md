    to work.\r\n\r\nThere have been som threads about this some time ago.\r\n\r\nTry
    and make a simple liga feature (or something else) and generate \u2013 see how
    it works."

  body: "Hi, thank you for your answers.\r\n\r\n1.I tried to generate on TrueType
    (.ttf) and opentype (.otf). The result it is the same.\r\n2. I show you a screenshoot.\r\n3.
    I tried on Photoshop cs2, illustrator cs2, word 2003,and Indesigncs2. But while
    I am writting the email I tried test in Freehand Mx and fantastic, the type run
    perfectly with the kerning! but.... why don't run in other software?\r\n\r\nThank
    you,\r\nIv\xE1n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshoot2_5501.jpg]"

  body: "CS2 applications have a bug that require at least one substitution feature
    in an OpenType font in order for the kerning to work. So you could add something
    like \r\n\r\n<code>feature ornm { \r\n  sub bullet by bullet; \r\n} ornm;</code>\r\n\r\nto
    the OpenType panel. It doesn't really matter so much what substitution feature
    the font has, but of course it would make sense if the feature would be somewhat
    meaningful and somehow related to your typeface. \r\n\r\nA."
