  body: As for books, if you're near a good library you could check out the 2005 and
    previous D&AD Annuals and Graphis Design Annuals. If my memory serves me right
    there is some good examples in there.

  body: I would definitely check out the Graphis Books. Also some of the David Carter
    books have letterhead samples. Oh and I believe it is "stationery", with an "e"
    not an "a". My old AD used to get on me about that all the time.

  body: "Cheers guys. \r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is that I love stationery but it always
    seems to be the part that takes me the longest to produce and I am least happy
    with in the end.\r\n\r\nAlso are there any rules that may help me?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    site and now iti's completely generic. But yes, you could check out their Letterhead
    5 and 6 books. They ain't bloody cheap tho. \r\n\r\nRockport also publishes Letterhead
