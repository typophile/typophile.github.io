  missing it since CS2 then I am just a hapless clown but I was working on a spiral
  logo shape and had scanned it in at a high resolution then in a matter of seconds
  selected and created a working path. The tool is under the \"Magic Wand\" tool bar
  and its labeled the \"Quick Selection\" tool. Anyone else found anything good?"

    the Adobe Studio Exchange download site. Just insert one into your document then
    you can manipulate/transform it to your taste. Easy!!! If you have Freehand, it
    comes with a spiral pen tool also.\r\nNo drawing from scratch required with either
    of the above!\r\nDB~"

  body: "The spiral tool creates a simple spiral on one line. It does not create a
    thicker to thinner spiral shape. Im trying to figure it out via just the computer
    but havent gotten to that yet. I was merely commenting on a new tool in Photoshop
    CS3 . . . The \"Quick Selection\" tool and the \"Refine Edge\" tool.\r\n\r\n"
