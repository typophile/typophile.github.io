  body: It's indeed a Didot, very similar to H&FJ Didot, Mike, but the nameplate is
    actually custom drawn.

  body: "Bald>\r\n\r\nNameplate = the Harpers Bazaar Logo?\r\n\r\nI would expect the
    logo to be different from the rest of the type family but isn't it HFJ Didot font
    used through out the 'rest' of the publication? On Hoefler's site it says 'originally
    drawn for Harpers'... does this mean HFJ Didot is not necessarily used in the
    publication 'now'?\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "Oy, you're right. The only typeface I could make out clearly enough was the
    nameplate (that's indeed the \"proper\" name for the logo on the cover of a magazine).
    You're most probably right about H&FJ Didot being used for heads. Sorry'boutthat.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I <em>am</em> bald, using that as a nickname for my online persona, so you're
    entitled to call me Bald if you wanna. :^P"

  body: "Thanks Bald- Yves- whatever- heheeheheee. \r\nAbout being bald... I still
    have my hair but it looks like its not staying for long- genetics suck!\r\n\r\nThanks
    for elucidating the word 'nameplate' too. HFJ have interpreted Didot's work nicely-
    very sexy proportions. \r\n\r\nAlthough if Jessijohn had a mac, she would probably
    be satisfied with the version of Linotype Didot (interpreted by Andrian Frutiger)
    that comes standard with Mac OS X and save herself $299.00. Linotype Didot comes
    standard with small caps- something HFJ Didot does not have. However, a thorough
    compliment of optical character sizes is standard equipment for HFJ Didot.\r\n\r\nMikey"
