  the \"less\" and \"greater\" characters really don't belong, but when editorial
  says they do, that's that; you set them. In most fonts, the less & greater glyphs
  may work OK with numbers, but look awful in text. It is easy enough to make up an
  alternative pair that work with such text.\r\n\r\nBUT:\r\n\r\nAs best I can tell,
  there are no greater or less characters in the Mathematical Operators portion of
  Unicode (2200-22FF), or in the supplement (2A00-2AFF) -- or anywhere else. All we
  have are U+003C and U+003E, so that rules out using the ASCII greater and less for
  text, and another pair for math.\r\n\r\nNor can I think of a contextual substitution
  that is foolproof. You could switch them to less.alt and greater.alt when preceded
  by or followed by an alpha character or punctuation, but there are cases where alphas
  are a part of an expression that should take the mathematical form.\r\n\r\nMy current
  notion is to put them in a stylistic set, but that means the typesetter will have
  to remember to switch it on for such citations, and that too has its perils.\r\n\r\nAnybody
  have a better solution? \r\n"

    can't say if it's theirs or just that I was careless with some macro. This is
    what hyperref gave me with the \\href macro, because when I write a url, I want
    it to be clickable, even in a pdf file. This is badly kerned indeed.\r\n\r\n[edit,
    the morning after...] By the way, I have never spent time trimming an otf font.
    Personally, I would format the bibliography without those \"less than\" and \"greater
    than\" that are not part of the url. I  would just choose a font for which the
    url does not look too awful. I have never seen them look right. I would probably
    make do with something like this, though I would have to check for the weights
    on paper. Here the serif is light, maybe the regular would have been better. This
    being said,  all I do is for personal or class use, and it always ends on a laser
    printer or just as a pdf for the web; I am no editor. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/biblio_5139.jpg]"

    that would be nice. Unfortunately, in book publishing the typesetter can't make

    a combination of design & editorial acting in concert to get any change.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I finally came up -- with for this time anyway -- is modified greater & less symbols,
    to be used only with text. They are switched on by a stylistic set, and using
    InDesign paragraph styles, you can do this for the entire bibliography without
    having to manually search & replace.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/less1_4143.gif]\r\nFor

    I have a problem. A book is frequently \"repurposed.\" It is important that the
    character names stay the same. For example, we just had an inquiry from a publisher
    who had bought the rights for a book from another publisher. To bring out the
    new edition, the text will either have to be rekeyed, or extracted from an exiting
    PDF file. This extraction isn't an automatic process, and I guess you could argue
    that whoever is doing the work could be on the lookout for this sort of thing
    -- angle brackets or guillemets that really should be greater/less. But it is
    best not to add to the problems of whoever is extracting the text (probably us
    in this case).\r\n\r\nI suppose by now I'm just back on my tired old horse of
    trying to inform the type design world that they cannot dictate things; that  aside
    from any preferences of end users of type, editors <cite>really</cite> rule the
    roost.\r\n\r\nWhat I was looking for was a better way to code a features file,

    That is one reason I like TeX and LaTeX. All you need to do is define a macro
    at the top of the file, say \\starturl and \\endurl and then use the macro in
    the text. You are then free to change the shape of those characters at will. When
    you \"reprocess\" the text, you need only redefine the macro. Years ago, many
    math characters were done that way. "

    AAUP Book Show books, see\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tsengbooks.com/\r\n\r\nOver the years,

    other reasons, but the final problem was that publishers wanted \"applications
    files,\" and wouldn't accept TeX. That is still the case. The only thing we won't
    cave on is when they also want the fonts. \"Nope,\" I say \"not allowed with the

  body: "Nick, when I'm designing -- as opposed to just setting type -- I'll use oldstyle
    figures for \"math\" as long as (1) there aren't multilevel equations, (2) there
    aren't many expressions with exponents, or (3) I think the audience would be upset.
    There are any number of books that use simple \"math\" constructions with plus,
    minus, equals, greater/less, etc. I'll use oldstyle numbers, and also make up
    a set of plus-minus-equal-divide-greater-less etc. glyphs to match them. With
    that set, the \"greater\" and\"less have to match the other conjunctors, and are
    still too long for a good URL delimiter.\r\n\r\nBut when, as most of the time,
    we're setting books designed by the publisher's designer, they specify figure
    style. Some will use old style figs as above, some switch to lining as soon as
    they see an equal sign.\r\n\r\nMoreover, publishers have house rules, too. For
    example, one allows small caps in the text, but requires full caps in the back
    matter (notes & bibliography). There is a certain rationale to this, notes and
    bibliographical entries are almost by definition \"interrupted.\" Further, the
    editors don't have to go through them & worry about GmbH, MoMA, etc.  Frequently,
    when I design for this publisher, I switch to lining figures in the backmatter,
    so you don't have citations from newspapers with a cap for the section coupled
    with an old-style number <cite>New York Times,</cite> C1.\r\n\r\nAgain, the point
    is the type designer can think up all sorts of neat tricks that work in some idealized
    world, but won't work given the practices of publishers.\r\n\r\nThe beginning
    of a URL is http. You also see ftp & a few others -- easy to identify. If you
    could somehow jump to the matching \"greater than\" from the beginning \"less\"
    in a OT feature, this is a solvable problem. Easy to do with regular expressions,
    but I don't believe you can use them."

    \"Bracket\"</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite>The mathematical or logical symbols for greater-than
    (>) and less-than (<) are inequality operators, and are not punctuation marks
    when so used. Nevertheless, since true angle brackets are not available on a typical
    computer keyboard, the \u201Cless than\u201D and \u201Cgreater than\u201D symbols
    are often used instead. These are often loosely referred to as angle brackets
    when used in this way. For example, the symbols < and > are often used to set
    apart URLs in text, such as \u201CI found it on Example.com &lt;http://www.example.com/&gt;\u201D.
    It may also often be found to indicate an e-mail address, such as \u201CThis photo
    is copyrighted by John Smith &lt;john@smith.com&gt;\u201D, and is the computer-readable
    form for such in message headers as specified by <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822\">RFC
    2822</a>.</cite>\r\n\r\nFrom the same entry we read:\r\n\r\n<cite>True angle brackets
    are available in Unicode at code points U+27E8 and U+27E9 (for mathematical use)
    and or U+3008 and U+300[9] (for East Asian languages). A third set of angle brackets
    are encoded at U+2329 and U+232A, but officially \"discouraged for mathematical
    use\"[5] because they are canonically equivalent to the CJK code points U+300\u2026
    and thus likely to render as double-width symbols.</cite>\r\n\r\nContrary to \"less
    than\" and \"greater than\", code points for angle brackets are thus numerous
    and the use of \"less than\" or \"greater than\" for URLs comes from our limited
    keyboards, or so it seems.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\n\r\n"
