  body: "Well, here is your answer: \r\n\r\nyou can create new sections of the Metrics.txt
    file (or best, put a copy into your user data folder first) by the following pattern:
    \r\n\r\n<code>%%CLASS_BEGIN\r\n#<em>name of your section</em>\r\n<em>names of
    classes as defined in the Classes panel</em>\r\n<em>separated by new lines</em>\r\n%%TEMPLATE\r\n<em>one-line
    template definition using the /glyphname or \\uUnicode notation, where @ is the
    currently active glyph and \\n is the place of the line wrap</em>\r\n%%CLASS_END</code>\r\n\r\nFor
    example, if you have classes \"onum1\", \"lnum1\", \"pnum1\" and \"tnum1\" defined
    in your Classes panel that contain all the various figure types, you could define
    a Metrics.txt section as follows: \r\n\r\n<code>%%CLASS_BEGIN\r\n#figures\r\nonum1\r\nlnum1\r\npnum1\r\ntnum1\r\n%%TEMPLATE\r\n/zero/one/two@/three/four\\n/five/six/seven@/eight/nine\\n/dollar/sterling/Euro@/cent/currency\\n/H/O/H@/n/o/n\\n\r\n%%CLASS_END</code>\r\n\r\nThe
    \"onum1\" etc. class names here refer to what is defined in the Classes panel
    as \"OpenType classes\", without any glyphname prefix. \r\n\r\nBut you can also
    use names of Metric classes here (named e.g. \".A\", \".O\" etc., with dot as
    the prefix) or Kerning classes (named e.g. \"_A\", \"_Y\" etc., with underscore
    as the prefix). \r\n\r\nAlso note that in kerning mode, \"@\" stands of the currently
    selected kerning pair, and that in such case, for both glyphs from the kerning
    pair the appropriate left or right part of the template is selected. So if you
    have a section defined for uppercase and another section defined for smallcaps,
    then for kerning pairs such as /T/y.smcp the left part of the template will be
    shown from the #uppercase section and the right part will be shown from the #smallcaps
    section. \r\n\r\nAlso note that in Metrics.txt, there are some internally pre-initialized
    glyph classes such as \"uppercase\", \"UPPERCASE\", \"LATIN_UC\", \"lowercase\",
    \"LOWERCASE\", \"LATIN_LC\", \"smallcaps\", \"SMALLCAPS\", \"LATIN_SC\". If they
    are not defined in the Classes panel, a default pre-initialized definition will
    be used for them but if you define classes with those names in your Classes panel,
    that definition will be used. Of course you can also have additional class names
    that you add to the appropriate sections for Metrics.txt, e.g. \"UC\", \"LC\",
    \"SC\" if that is how you choose to name your classes in the Classes panel. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
