    have you now decided to design the logo for your company yourself? "

    with a logo. In Romania spending money on a logo is out of the question now.\r\n
    \      We should be happy to have a company to fit a logo.\r\n"

  body: I like the match you have. Of course the font reminds me of Copperplate and
    that might be a good complement as well...

  body: I much prefer the contrasting sans serif. But not really happy about the relationship
    between mark & name - explore!

  body: 'I also think contrast would work better. I like the sans you used. My critique
    would be that the dot in the logo without a space looks a bit awkward, it probably
    should make it more recognisable, but I think it distracts and makes it harder
    to read. Maybe you could try a version without the dot? About the font: I think
    with the sans the whole thing gets a kind of art-deco flavour. Is this appropriate
    for you? Somthing slightly less extended might work better, or at least make it
    more contemporary. Something like Freight sans or Alright sans, perhaps.'
