  for the course I teach on part time 'Interactive Design' at the University of Lincoln.
  (We're promoting a show which is uses obsolete handheld tv's to showcase student
  work.) I love this visual for the familiarity and distinct/unique look it can provide-
  I want to develop the chromakey blue and the aesthetic of this typeface but for
  the life of me I cant identify it. I think it might be freeware as its so universal
  for interface design. \r\n\r\nAny ideas would be very welcome\r\n\r\nTake it easy.
  Cheers \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/INTERFACE_5159.jpg]"

    under a number of names.\r\n\r\nOne that's close is Raster Gothic:\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000204\r\n\r\n...or
    try Googling \"Pixel Fonts\" or \"Pixellated fonts\""

  body: "Hi View, welcome to the forums! : )\r\n\r\nThe typeface your after is [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/mondosearchresults.htm?st=12&kid=CHUNKFEEDER|Chunkfeeder]]..?\r\n\r\nThe
    sample you have supllied would have a much smaller pixel ratio and so would slightly
    blur the characters, and as a result, 'soften' the appearance, as with your sample.
    Chunkfeeder is a variant of an OCR typeface, a monospaced, used with such HUD's
    and displays, VHS for example. Chunkfeeder is a versatile family of 6 fonts -
    3 different weights, each with an italic.\r\n\r\nBest of luck with your project.\r\n__\r\nRez\r\n"

  body: As much as I'd like to sell another Raster Gothic license (I'm its designer),
    it's not going to match your sample very well since it is not a fixed-width font.

  body: "The VCR menu sample isn't fixed-width either, Mark. Note how each <cite>I</cite>
    fails to line up, for example.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Raster Gothic isn't a close
    match. Both Screener and Chunkfeeder are much more similar to the VCR menu sample.
    (And for what it's worth, Screener isn't fixed-width either.)"
