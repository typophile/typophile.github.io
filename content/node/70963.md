  design agency in 3 days. It's my first time and I would appreciate if more experienced
  ones could give their advice on thing that I should have on my mind and do on the
  day of interview. For example the dress code, how many works should I present, should
  I do a screen presentation, put thing on a cd for them and etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

  body: "The last interview I went to, I was so nervous that I downed a whole bottle
    of Rescue Remedy before going in. Just be polite, smile, have questions ready
    about the company - express interest in what they do, with examples. Whatever
    way you show your work, make sure it's clear and works properly (have back-up
    if need be). Don't show anything you're not proud of, and can't defend under expert
    scrutiny. Be prepared for tricky questions such as: how long do you think you'd
    need to be working here till you'd be making a contribution to the company?, how
    much do you think you deserve to be paid?, how will you adapt to very tight deadlines
    for sometimes dull projects, after the relatively easy creative freedom of college?\r\n\r\nJust
    dress like a smart version of your everyday self (not for a wedding but not for
    screenprinting). Wear something you really like and feel comfortable in. Good
    luck :)"

  body: 'Another important point: if you don''t know something, admit it. Ignorance
    is curable, but lying about your ignorance will not score points, and could sink
    your prospects. The best response to "do you know how to [such-and-such]" is:
    "No, I don''t, but I''m looking forward to learning about it." This would also
    include the above-mentioned question about "how much you <em>deserve</em> to be
    paid." A good answer: "I don''t know: you''re the experts, and I''m new to all
    of this. But I''m sure that, if you offer me this job, the pay will be fair."'

    of their work and philosophy?\r\nPerhaps not.\r\nSo do your homework.\r\n"
