  Client says it's called \"CGA\" but there's no such font AFAICT. MyFonts.com WTF
  couldn't pick it. Is it a custom face?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nPAUL\r\nSkyRocket Design

  body: "I think this is an old Casady & Greene font from their \"Fluent Fonts\" collection,
    one of the earliest sets of third party PostScript fonts. I don't know the name
    of it, though.\r\n\r\nSince they closed their doors a couple of years ago (after
    selling their SoundJam MP3 player to Apple as a basis for iTunes), I don't know
    what's become of their fonts. Their former web address (http://www.casadyg.com/)
    is now one of those horrible generic web portals and has nothing to do with the
    original organization (not unlike http://www.typographi.ca).\r\n\r\nEdit: Actually,
    the collection was called \"Fluent Laser Fonts\" and the font in question was
    called Calligraphy. More about them <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/index.htm\">here</a>,
    including the actual fonts which are apparently in the public domain now."

  body: Incidentally, C&G's Calligraphy is, in fact, a poorly drawn copy of El Greco,
    a face designed for H. Berthold in 1964 by Gunter Gerhard Lange. If you want the
    real thing (which is about a hundred times higher quality) you can get it from
    <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=AB80395003P1">Phil's Fonts</a>.
