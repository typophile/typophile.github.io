  body: "If that's the vintage (1950's) then it seems like it can only be a custom
    designed typeface produced as a decal. It is a simplified 'blackletter' design
    that doesn't look much like any digital blackletter font I can find. The J and
    T, for example, are not typical blackletter shapes at all, and the 's' is quite
    simple, by comparison to most blackletter fonts.\r\n\r\nA few candidates for simple
    blackletter styles are: SkyClad Gothic, Brauhaus and Kingshead (all at MyFonts).
    If you want it to look exactly like this you may need to hire someone, or break
    out the Illustrator/Photoshop software.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
