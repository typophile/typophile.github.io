    similar for the script, [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/CAC-Champagne|CAC
    Champagne]].\r\nFor \"ROSES\", part of makes me thinking to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/chevalier/|Chevalier]],
    I've tried to consider it as \"base font with handtooled post-treatment\" but
    wasn't able to find any match. Would really like to know for this one too."
