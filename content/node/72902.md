body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nI'm sure this has been asked here before, but the Search function
  turned up nothing. To make a long story short, I'm making a German propaganda poster
  (from WWII) for a group project, but I have no idea what font I should use.\r\n\r\nSince
  I'm short on money, I would appreciate if you could refer me to some free fonts,
  and if they're not free, than the closest free font.\r\n\r\nHere's some pictures
  of what I'm looking for (I apologize in advance if they offend anyone). They're
  different fonts, but I wanted to give myself as much choice as possible:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/38742t_5800.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nazi-propaganda-poster-during-war_5239.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WWII_Nazi_Propaganda_-_Waffen-SS_3581.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/40-49
  german propaganda 3_5665.jpg]\r\n\r\nOf course, if you guys have any recommendations
  of other fonts, it is greatly appreciated as well!\r\n\r\nThanks for all your time
  and help!"
