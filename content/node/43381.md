  edgy, feels like perhaps it has a 70's feel...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uma_type_3633.png]"

    problem is more widespread than some might think. And does the world care? \"Public
    awareness\" is the oxymoron of our age."

    it.\r\nIt's custom and I think that there some post in the past about Another
    Magazine's fonts.\r\nI think [[http://www.buero-newyork.com|these Guys]] are making
    the typography of Another Magazine."

    thanks for the advice- how does one try the 'expand and stroke' filter is that

  body: "Anyone know how to try and reproduce this sexy font, have been playing around
    with stokes (reducing the weight), using Cheltenham Ultra as suggested which seems
    to be the closest...but no luck. Client really likes the distorted feel of the
    typeface.\r\nIdeas? "
