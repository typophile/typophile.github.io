  body: I agree...as a lefty, when writing, I have always had troubles with not only
    Ss, but also <BR>5s and 8s. <BR>Now in typography, it is even a bigger issue.

  body: I used to have a lot more trouble with the &#34;S&#34; particularly in really
    heavy weights. <BR> <BR>One trick that has helped a bit is to get rid of the on-curve
    points at the inflection points on the spine of the S until the shape is perfect
    and finalized. Using only the vertical control points to control each side of
    the spine curve helps immensely. <BR> <BR>I think that Leslie Cabarga may have
    mentioned this in his &#34;Logo, Font &amp; Lettering Bible.&#34; <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T

  body: Leslie does mention it. <BR> <BR>That book is awesome, chuck-full-of-info/insights/tips
    and a definite must to the budding designer like myself. &#40;No, I&#39;m not
    a paid endorser. I think you have to be well known for that sort of thing.&#41;  <BR>
    <BR>Oh, and I agree about the &#34;S&#34; thing.
