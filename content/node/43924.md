  I had all of my fonts neatly collected into the folders in which they should  be.
  House industries,  Carson.... yada yada...\r\n\r\nApparently when I activate them
  in font book it pulls them from that folder. Does anyone know a way to recollect
  them from font book and put them back into the folders they were pulled from?"

    I'm surprised it's still doing it that way as there used to be many tales of woe.
    I can't suggest how to restore the sets, but you might like to look into better
    font management software for future happiness. I use [[http://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX|Linotype's
    free FontExplorer X]]. Which is fantastic at everything bar printing specimines.
    The built-in iTunes like shop is brilliant too -- you can quickly search for most
    things and get good (though usually brief) historical information really quickly.
    \r\n\r\nThinking about it, on first run I think you can have it organise everything,
    so it might solve your Font Book mess if you point FontExplorer to the directories
    Font Book moved things into."

    copy not the font in its sorted folder. Now using Version 2.03.  I remember the
    first version did as you describe. '
