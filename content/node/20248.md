body: Why does IE6 ask me if it wants to remember my account log-in password for Typophile
  but when I say yes, it never does...?

  body: "Why not just ditch Windows? Mac OS X not only stores you names and passwords
    properly, but stores them from all your applications in the same place \u2013\_a
    128-bit encrypted database that's searchable/usable only by its owner. That way,
    regardless of what browser you use, your name and password will always propagate.\r\n\r\nBut
    if you're stuck on Windows, then get rid of IE6 and immediately install Firefox."
