body: "I just started working on a typeface for personal use and I want to design
  it work at a specific point size (11 pts to be exact). For this specific type project,
  it doesn't matter to me if it works at any other point or if it works in print,
  just on screen at 11pts.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, how should I get started? I've
  been playing with UPM and different cap, x, ascender and descender heights in Fontlab
  but I haven't been able to settle on the right starting point. I guess my big question
  is, how would you get started on a project like this and what should I keep in mind
  to optimize a font for one really specific situation like this?"

    a 125 x 125 unit grid, and set the font at 8 pt (72 dpi)\r\nno matter how big
    it actually is.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I think yo want to make a new font \r\n\r\nset units per em to 256, so as
    not to waste precious units per em.\r\n\r\nset grid step to 256/11, or 23 units
    per em, per pixel x and y.\r\n\r\nset metrics window to 11 pt.\r\n\r\ndraw...
    look... draw... look... until generation time. \r\n\r\nIt is true that the optimization
    may not always appear when any user selects \"11\", but this is just for you,
    and you are not just \"any user.\"\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Andreas, as long as the dpi is fixed a\r\ngiven point size maps to a specific
    PPEM.\r\n\r\nWindows can change the dpi (although it's very\r\nrarely actually
    done). Can MacOS do that now?\r\n\r\n> set grid step to 256/11\r\n\r\n1)What about
    systems that assume an EM of 1000?\r\nAre those safe to ignore these days?\r\n\r\n2)
    Since that's not a whole number, doesn't it all\r\nend up looking blurry?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBTW,
    my view of good vertical proportions for an 11 PPEM font are:\r\n\r\nx: 7\r\nascenders:
    9\r\ndescenders: -2\r\ncaps: 8\r\nlining nums: 8\r\nOS* nums: 7\r\n\r\nIf you
    want a smaller x-height you can go to 6, but then I'd leave the\r\nrest the same
    (in fact that makes the ascenders nicely longer than\r\nthe descenders - a good
    thing).\r\n\r\n* No room for hybrids.  :-(\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hrant, the problem is, not every screen has the same dpi. I'm not sure the
    OP knows what he means by <em>"just on screen at 11pts"</em> Many web designers
    are not really aware of how different their stuff will look on other computer
    screens. I for one have 97 dpi on my desktop and 133 dpi on my netbook.

  body: "Oh, but the OS's dpi is what determines if the pixels in a pixelfont map
    correctly or not. It's just that on a higher-dpi display the pixels are smaller;
    so we're not (or rather, we shouldn't be) talking about actual height in inches.
    That's why it's less confusing to use \"PPEM\" instead of \"point size\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
