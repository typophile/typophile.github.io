  body: "That's what I thought at first...  I have Bauer Bodoni and Bodoni LT Standard.
    Bodoni SEEMS fairly close but upon closer inspection, it's not quite a 100% match.
    The capital \"A\" has a flat top and the lower case \"a\" seems curvy-er (for
    lack of a better word) on the title tx versus the font.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's another,
    more obscure version of Bodoni?"

    the \u2018e\u2019 and the \u2018o\u2019. One has a straight line in the counter,
    the other doesn\u2019t.\r\nAnd then there\u2019s a whole lotta squooshing goin\u2019
    on."

  body: "Humm\u2026 Jan's probably right. But the uppercase and lowercase As are definitely
    Bodoni LT (uppercase is squeezed and lowercase is smacked, both squooshed in different
    directions). The Y seems like Bauer Bodoni, because it seems to have a curve on
    the left stroke. Uppercase Ss seem different\u2026 lowercase Us could be lowercase
    Ns rotated and with the top serifs chopped off on the right side (just because
    that lower serif seems to have a curve, which is a trait of Bodonis, but the picture's
    too small too make some things out clearly)\u2026 uppercase Ls are also different,
    may have been edited. Lowercase B is Bodoni, I think, again, because it seems
    to have a curve on the upper serif.\r\nDon't you think?\r\n\r\nruD"
