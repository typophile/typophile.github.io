  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, I have to redesign a restaurant&#39;s logo for an assignment, and I would love to get some feedback.  <BR> <BR>The restaurant I chose offers fine dining as well as a more casual cafe in the front &#40;although you can dress pretty casually in either part of the restuarant&#41;. It serves contemporary French cuisine, and the decor is very art nouveau, saying that the main restaurant is set in a turn-of-the-century, restored ballroom. Since the space is so &#34;grand&#34; and the gorgeous chandeliers inside left a lasting impression with me, I wanted to incoroprate the grandness of the space, its art nouveau roots and of course the chandeliers. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve done many versions, but this is the direction my teacher liked best. I&#39;m not exactly crazy about it &#40;I think it may be a little too bulky and unversitle&#41;, but the other solutions I had didn&#39;t seem &#34;grand&#34; enough. <BR> <BR>Please let me know what you think! Some good, constructive feedback would be wonderful! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/52753.jpg" alt="grandcafe"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Do you have photos of the chandelier? The illustration seems a little off, particularly the perspective of the bottom part.  <BR> <BR>Also  the size of the chandelier is overwhelming your logo. I know you want to express the grandness of the space, but I do not get an impression of the space nor the size of the chandelier. Maybe if you juxaposed it with another object in the room &#40;without adding too much clutter&#41; you could get a better relational idea of the space. Or even cropping the illustration asymetrically might give some interesting white space.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sara: <BR> <BR>I like the direction you are taking with the bizcard. It might make sense to take that direction with the logo itself, meaning use the logotype as &#34;the logo&#34; and use the chandelier liberally as a supporting graphic element. <BR> <BR>Have you tried reversing the positive/negative treatment? In other words, have you tried making the chandelier a lighter color and the negative space the darker color? I ask because my first impression of the graphic was that it was an upside down 3-layered chocolate cake &#40;which made me hungry&#41;. When I saw the photos in your last post, I thought that the graphic might resemble the chandelier better if it were reversed</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Something that might help to more easily identify the chandelier is adding the support rod on top. If you do try that, you might also try moving Grand Cafe above the chandelier.

		<div class="commentbody">I like the abstracted chandelier shapes, but right now they are also evoking other imagery: cakes, orange sections, wheels, etc.  <BR>The image is so abstract, people might not see it. It&#39;s an interesting shape, but I doubt anyone but us would make recognize it as a chandelier.  <BR> <BR>I also like #3 as a card, but not as a logo. I made a quick rough for the card and added a smaller chandelier for perspective; tring to give a sense of space. I also adjusted the bottom parts of the chandelier that I mentioned was &#34;kind of off&#34; in my previous post. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53337.gif" alt=""></div>
