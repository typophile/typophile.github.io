body: "ok so the wiki has been opperating a bit erratically. here are some general
  comments by James Grieshaber that may help understand some of the issues:\r\n\r\n<em>OK,
  about the \u201Caccess denied\u201D thing, this is what I have figured out so far.
  It appears that the Wiki is making up incorrect addresses for some of the links,
  and the addresses are case sensitive. For example, when you click on the \u201CIndicies\u201D
  link, it uses this address - http://typophile.com/wiki/indices. But it should be
  this - http://typophile.com/wiki/Indices. The difference is the cap \u201CI\u201D
  on \u201CIndices\u201D in the address.\r\n\r\nAnother example: This link to Blackletter
  - http://typophile.com/wiki/Blackletter, should have a lower case \u201Cb\u201D.
  So there doesen\u2019t seem to be any rhyme or reason to the link names case.\r\n\r\nI
  have also found this kind of link - http://typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif, which
  dosen\u2019t work. the \u201C%20\u201D part of that address represents a \u201Cspace\u201D,
  so that is OK. But if I change the first \u201Cs\u201D to a \u201CS\u201D then it
  works. Hmmm.\r\n\r\nI have also found this oddity. In a Wiki link to a string like
  \u201D Barnhart Brothers & Spindler\u201D, it will truncate it to \u201CBarnhart
  Brothers\u201D, ignoring everthing after the \u201C&\u201D\u2026 sometimes\u2026
  not all the time.</em>\r\n\r\ni think that there may also be certain browser issues
  as some users are not able to follow the same links to wiki entries as i am. it's
  all rather confusing, but please don't give up trying to contribute! it just takes
  a bit of fiddling..."

  body: "The Man doesn't want anyone reading my Typowiki entries! It's a conspiracy!\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe it's just that I created those entries early on and the links have gone
    bad due to upgrades to the wiki after I wrote them.\r\n\r\nNah, nah, I think it's
    The Man."

  body: "I am in Firefox, and haven't had problems earlier.  \r\n\r\nAnother issue
    may have to do with links to the indices, and stuff not being consistent where
    there are links to links--I'm not sure. For example, the recent 'Souvenir' link
    that I contributed to should, it seem be listed under 'Typefaces' on the index
    page, but it's not. Are the links to links causing erratic behavior?\r\n\r\nIt
    was after I posted that I got blocked, so another hypothesis is that when you
    post it sometimes changes the case or something. If so, hopefully this is fixable!

  body: william, entries have to be added manually, so the only way that [[Souvenir]]
    would be listed in [[Typefaces]] would be if someone added it manually (which
    i did earlier today, have a look)
