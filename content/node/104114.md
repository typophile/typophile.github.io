  body: "Seems like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-avant-garde-gothic/bold/\">Avant
    Garde Gothic Bold</a>. The words \"This Infinite World\" seem to be stretched,
    or there is another vendor with an expanded version.\r\nDon"

  body: Thought also to Avant-Garde but I don't think that's it. Too many details
    look off to me (digits, /e...) and the Bold weight is far not enough bold. I thought
    also to [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik|Graphik]] and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/fakt_complete_pro|Fakt]]
    but even after playing with alternates, that's not it either. Still searching.

  body: "Before posting the suggestion of Avant Garde Gothic Bold I ran the letters
    & numbers through Identifont, which suggested only Fakt. I checked the same link
    you posted and rejected Fakt mainly on the width issue, as its widest version
    was even narrower than Avant Garde Gothic Bold. I found nothing else that matched,
    even on some sites such as Hoefler & Frere Jones that don't show up at MyFonts.\r\nSince
    this was a sign for an artistic event, I went with the possibility of Avant Garde
    Gothic Bold expanded by the sign designer.\r\nSo I wonder what else is out there.
    A \"free\" font? An in-house font by the museum? Something by a German foundry
    that I missed?\r\nThe image posted by July has excellent detail but is hard to
    read without a kink in the neck. Here it is, rotated  90 degrees, and rearranged
    so it's easier to check letters. Ignore the jagged letter edges that appear in
    parts of the image. They are artefacts from a quick & dirty geometric distortion
    correction.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FotoB_6166.JPG]\r\nPerhaps
    this will prompt some other suggestions.\r\nDon"
