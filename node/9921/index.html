  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey,</p>
<p>I am wondering what [[blackletter]] faces are usually used for. I should mention that I am from [[New Zealand]], which is a very, very young country. The only time I see blackletter faces around here are for fashion labels (on the goth bandwagon) and heavy metal record covers. Or not-heavy-metal-record-covers that are being ironic. The covers are mostly foreign (i.e. American, British) anyway.</p>
<p>Oh right, and on newspaper titles.</p>
<p>So, where else arethey be used?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Looking at that Reebok site, I got this idea: why not marry a revival of blackletter with all-lc setting? This might make sense on a number of levels: blackletter UC is (traditionally) illegible (to those who only know the Roman structures); German text has too many caps (at least many Germans think so); one reform will keep the other company, so to speak*. Noting that Otl Aicher set the German text in his Typographie in all-lc. &lt;preempt&gt;Yes, and in Rotis too&hellip;&lt;/preempt&gt; <BR> <BR>* Although I'm personally a huge fan of mixed-case text; I'm just thinking of an angle to break the ice (faster). <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi,
As I just recently stumbled about this forum, I hope there is still someone&hellip;
Now my Question:
I am doing now the final project in my graphic design studies and my theme is treating the 
recognition and usage of blackletter typefaces in our times.
As I am german it is pretty clear to me how it is in the german speaking area.
What I am more interested in is how other cultures see and &ldquo;feel&rdquo; those typefaces.
What associations are made and so on&hellip;</p>
<p>So, I am really interested in other points of you, far from the beer and nationalist cliché.</p>
<p>@diego m: Maybe I could contact you to get to know the latino point of view?</p>
<p>I am happy about all replys, Thank you</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Welcome to Typophile, Don! <BR> <BR>I certainly agree with you that Blackletter is a rich, and varied medium, which can be used just like any other tool for the right purpose. However, I disagree with two other things that you mentioned in your post. <BR> <BR>First, the second world war has everything to do with the decline of blackletter as a used typeface style(s). Blackletter today serves a number of decorative roles in design and society. But pre-1930, it was used for a wider scope of design roles. Today, most Germans avoid Blackletter like the plague, because they associate it with Nazism (and people's assumptions are often more powerful and convincing that the truth). This reaction is especially true in younger Germans, in my experience, even among graphic designers (who should know their type history better).  <BR> <BR>Books just aren't printed with Blackletter types anymore, neither in Germany nor elsewhere. Blackletter may still be seen the world over (even in Germany, especially on things that are supposed to look old, or on beer labels), but it has been relegated to a much less significant, and more superficial place. <BR> <BR>Secondly, it wasn't Claude Garamond in c.1540 who struck the death-blow to Blackletter as text in non-Germanic countries, but rather the duo of German printers and Italian patrons in the 1460s and 70s. Especially Nicholas Jenson (okay, he wasn't really German, but he was a Gutenberg apprentice in Mainz, I think). <BR> <BR>The Italians never embraced Blackletter printing. Even their more-native Rotunda hands didn't get much press. The Renaissance Humanists wanted &quot;Roman&quot; looking letters. They actually got Frankish letters, but they couldn't tell the difference <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>They never took to Textura or Schwabacher, like patrons in Germany (and Holland, England, Scandinavia, etc) were doing. And by the time that the Holy Roman Emperor commissioned the design of Fraktur, there was a stylistic split across Europe which would soon become ideological: Luther's works were solely printed with Schwabacher and Fraktur types, making them &quot;Protestant&quot; type. A southern Catholic would have used those letters for his books at his peril.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In my above post, I generalized with the term &quot;southern Catholic.&quot; I really meant the countries south of Germany, from 1517 onward. <BR> <BR>I should point out as an additional aside that, in Southern (i.e., Catholic) Germany, Textura was still used during the Reformation and Counterreformation to set religious texts in Latin, and that was OK. After a certain point (I can't put a date on this), there wouldn't have been any &quot;Protestant&quot; stigma attached to any sort of lettering style within the German-speaking countries; I suspect that this was after the Catholic Church in Germany felt comfortable enough with the relative success of their Counterreformation. <BR> <BR>However, were I a printer in Rome in the 1600s, I would not have tried printing anything for the Pope with Fraktur</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Jenson and company (not Garamont) did indeed have more influence on the demotion of blackletter than WWII. It's true that the Nazis were most responsible for reducing its usage (after having hailed it as the &quot;true German typestyle&quot;), but think about why they really dumped it: it was unsuitable to the needs of Empire; and only because of the pre-existing typographic situation, due to&hellip; the Italian Humanists!

The three parameters are translation (movement in the Cartesian plane), rotation (of the pen) and pressure (which releases more ink, with the correct type of pen). In fact, even in hands that are based on a fixed angle you get the occasional exception (depending on the letter &quot;skeleton&quot; - think of the &quot;z&quot;), to avoid ungainly results. <BR> <BR>BTW, there's quite an uncanny similarity between certain Celtic manuscript motifs and certain Armenian ones, including the famed knotwork&hellip; And from what I understand there are at least two scholars working to figure this out. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

I wasn't going out on a limb here, merely reporting what is a commonly recognized bit of typographic history. And I wasn't just talking about France, but the majority of Europe.

Many more can be found without much effort. <BR> <BR> <BR>CLAUDE GARAMOND'S EFFECT ON BLACKLETTER: <BR> <BR>&quot;His roman letter forms won general acceptance in France and elsewhere and were a chief influence in establishing the roman letter as standard, in place of the gothic or black letter.&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello everyone. I’m new here. I’m a mexican graphic designer studying an MA in Graphic Design in London. I’m so happy that I found this blog, because I been thinking on making my thesis exactly on fraktur type in Mexico!!!!!! This idea has been in my mind for a long time, but I always thought that no many people would agree. I would like to know why is such a Germanic element taken by Mexicans and completely changed in terms of what it imply. 
Certainly by reading all your comments I been inspired. Thanks, and hope this conversation continues.</div>

<p>Hi, in response to your post below (and hopefully there are still people checking this forum):</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;&ldquo;&ldquo;Hi,
As I just recently stumbled about this forum, I hope there is still someone…
Now my Question:
I am doing now the final project in my graphic design studies and my theme is treating the
recognition and usage of blackletter typefaces in our times.
As I am german it is pretty clear to me how it is in the german speaking area.
What I am more interested in is how other cultures see and “feel” those typefaces.
What associations are made and so on…</p>
<p>So, I am really interested in other points of you, far from the beer and nationalist cliché.</p>
<p>@diego m: Maybe I could contact you to get to know the latino point of view?</p>
<h2 id="i-am-happy-about-all-replys-thank-you">I am happy about all replys, Thank you&rdquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</h2>
<p>Glad to hear your from Germany. I&rsquo;m a New Zealander and also doing a final year project on Blackletter:</p>
<p>Central Question
&ldquo;Can validity be restored to blackletter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How do German&rsquo;s view blackletter today (I will wait to see if anyone active on here before answering your quesiton).</p>
