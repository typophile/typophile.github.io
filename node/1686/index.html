		<div class="commentbody">Is the UK part of Europe? <BR> <BR>I agree, from my limited and largely anecdotal knowledge, that the situation in European universities and colleges is not so dire as it is over here, but there was a period of creeping American influence at least in UK universities, although this may have abated. It seems to me to be a cultural issue: not so much the ideas but the implementation of ideas within a particular framework. Matha noted in the previous discussion that the French educational system was quite conservative, despite having produced so many radical thinkers. This is a cultural difference between French and American academia, and indicates why the same radical ideas might have a different impact in different countries.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Is the UK part of Europe?</i> <BR> <BR>Everyone apart from the UK government seems to think so. I've come across a few strange research projects in the UK but nothing too scary. <BR> <BR><i>the same radical ideas might have a different impact in different countries.</i> <BR> <BR>I think you've hit the nail on the head, John. I would go further and suggest that there is a lack of proportion and definitely not enough scepticism in the American handling of French philosophy. Baudrillard, for example, is considered a bit of a nut by a lot of French scholars. <BR> <BR>Also, I'm half-way through Eco's book on the search for the perfect language and the way he describes it, European Academia has been absorbing all sorts of craziness for centuries. America doesn't have enough experience yet, maybe. <BR> <BR>M.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">[ducking for cover as I enter the thread] <BR> <BR>Has anyone read Alan Bloom's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671657151/qid=1066168854/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-1579554-2009616" target="_blank"> Closing of the American Mind</a>? It's somewhat dated by now, but does it have any relevance to this entire discussion? Frankly, I've not read it - I picked up a copy in grad school and it's been gathering dust since. I'm thinking it might be the time to break the spine finally&hellip; <BR> <BR>As far as the current discussion goes though, I'm sure that Dan's right - that there are exceptions in various institutions throughout America - but in my mind Hrant's insight that <i>overall trends are more relevant than exceptions</i> is a good one. <BR> <BR>I, fortunately or unfortunately, spent two years at the University of Chicago and I wouldn't count it as one of the &quot;exceptions&quot;. Seemed plagued by quasi-French-intellectualism. Of course that's a blanket statement which isn't meant to discount everyone there - Jim McCawley (r.i.p.) was perhaps the most amazing thinker I've come into contact with. Always seemed to eschew whichever current trends and styles happened to prevail. After all, who needs Optimality Theory or Minimalism or Government &amp; Binding, when you can have The Syntactic Phenomena of English :-) <BR> <BR>I must say that I'm disturbed at myself for feeling I have to put disclaimers like that after my (obviously) generalized comments.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I didn't take up John H.'s comment as I didn't have time, and this thread isn't about it. But I will comment.  <BR> <BR>Non-Americans pontificating about America - and I include John Hudson here - often miss large parts of the picture.  <BR> <BR>It is perfectly true that the American mass entertainment media pander to the lowest instincts of people, including flattering the average consumer by assuring them that everone more intelligent or learned is contemptible in some way or other.  <BR> <BR>But they sometimes also rise above such pandering and do wonderful stuff. And, more important, America is not to be identified with the American mass media.  <BR> <BR>Many parents and teachers are constantly waging intellectual battle against the debased tone of the mass entertainment media. And there are huge communities of thoughtful people that totally ignore such drivel. They are vibrant and vital and behind the most dynamic economy in the world.  <BR> <BR>Judging America only by the mass media is like those people outside the US 50 years ago who used to think that we were full of cowboys, Indians, and rich people in mansions - because that is who was in the movies.  <BR> <BR>Of course there is anti-intellectualism here, and it is a despicable American tradition.  <BR> <BR>A pretty accurate assessment was given by Alistair Cook, who observed the US through British eyes for most of the last century. He said that in the US there was a constant struggle between forces that were powerfully creating a better society, and forces that were causing the decay of civilization. The last time I heard him on TV (5 or more years ago) he thought that the forces of decay might be getting the upper hand. <BR> <BR>I think it is a pretty near thing.</div>

I don't think I said much more than what you report Alistair Cooke saying: 'the forces of decay might be getting the upper hand'. Only a fool would assume that mass media youth culture represents all American culture, but it is important to guage the extent of its impact, which is <i>very</i> considerable. But we're getting away from John Butler's original question regarding academia. <BR> <BR>Yes, English departments seem to be the worst afflicted, but as reported in the previous thread, even disciplines like geography have accepted the critical theory approach to epistemology. Yes, we all had a good chuckle when physicist Alan Sokal's hoax 'Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity' was accepted for publication in a humanities journal. I was less amused last year when Igor and Grichka Bogdanov successfully published <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000017.html">four physics papers</a> that peer reviewers admitted were incomprehensible and probably  nonsense.

I was a fine arts major [the shame, the horror] - and the presence of it was thick. So I feld to the linguistics department as much as possible. And psychology/anthroplogy where it was much less. It's become pretty common for 'artists'  to fob off their work as some sort of meaningful cultural analysis. Mostly without content - just a giant exegetical playground that we can well do without. Powerpuff Girls have become our Venus of Urbino. <BR> <BR>I blame it on Duchamp :-)</div>

I got overheated from Hrant's provocation. <BR> <BR>One thing I think you overdid, though: <BR> <BR>&quot;kids, in particular, are encouraged not to think, by their peers&quot;  <BR> <BR>In American high schools there are typically different groups and the kids mainly take their group of friends as their reference group.  <BR> <BR>I have had my three children go through American High Schools over a period of 11 years, up to 3 years ago. I don't really think any of my kids felt these pressures very strongly.  <BR> <BR>I know among groups and some schools the pressures are there, but it is misleading to make it a blanket statement. Also academically less accomplished kids may put up a front of indifference or hostility while actually envying the academically adept. And many kids figure this out.  <BR> <BR>I don't know what exactly the truth is here. Anti-intellectualism is an important problem to be combatted - and from what I read this is particularly so in the Black community. But it needs to be understood to combat it, and it is not necessarily all it seems on the surface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;some amount of salt during reading. <BR> <BR>Well, since you encourage me I'll be blunt. Wittgenstein made philosophy into a pointless academic game. As I understand it - and you doubtless know more here - the linguists didn't find him particularly innovative in so far as he got on their territory.  <BR> <BR>The authors of 'Wittgenstein's Poker' in my view did a great disservice to Popper by assuming the conventional view of Wittgenstein as great, so Popper couldn't be right. Incidentally, I think the two authors probably disagree because there are contradictions left the text.  <BR> <BR>Also by not understanding rightly the poker incident they ended up accusing Popper of lying, which really is not so plausible if you understand really what was going on.  <BR> <BR>Popper is the real thing - a powerful, innovative thinker on important issues. If you read those amazing essays in 'Conjectures and Refutations' you will see what I mean.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oi. Cross-posted. <BR> <BR>&gt;'Conjectures and Refutations'  <BR> <BR>I'll be picking that one up this week. Thanks. <BR> <BR>[disclaimer: I'm not a real linguist, but I play one on the internet] <BR> <BR>I don't think that linguistics got much from Wittgenstein. Certainly not from the whole 'picture theory' bit. But the later stuff - the 'ordinary language' stuff - has it's impact. Even if every linguist isn't proclaiming the name of Wittgenstein.  <BR> <BR>I don't think much from the early 20th century has much impact on contemporary linguistics - not even the 'proper linguists' like Bloomfield and Sapir. Transformational synatx and generative semantics didn't really come about until the 1950s - and that's more or less the [general] model for what people are doing now. <BR> <BR>The ideas of people like J L Austin are pretty well respected and, as far as I'm aware, they deal with similar things to later Wittgenstein (e.g., <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>). It's still the whole 'ordinary language' idea. And, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674411528/qid=1066178604/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1579554-2009616?v=glance&amp;s=books" target="_blank"> Austin's book</a> says, they're both dealing with how language really works, and how we do things with it. But those ideas are all from around the 1950s - the birth of modern linguistics. <BR> <BR>That's my understanding, for whatever it may be worth. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, I enjoyed <i>Wittgenstein's Poker</i>, but I did feel like Popper got the crappy end of the stick. &quot;LW is a charismatic &amp; powerful thinker full of prescient thoughts while EP is a snivelling twat clutching the skirts of Russell.&quot; Somehow I doubt it was quite like that :-/ <BR> <BR>Stanley Cavell actually has an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0631192719/qid=1066180376/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/002-1579554-2009616?v=glance&amp;s=books" target="_blank"> essay about another philosophical argument</a> - this one between Austin and Derrida (ordinary language vs. infinite slippage or whatever). Shamefully it's another book I have on the shelf and haven't read. Might be a real gem in this conversation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On anti-intellectualism in American high schools: <BR> <BR>Well, on this point I'm prepared to admit that I am wrong about how dominant the anti-intellectual attitude is - but not quite yet. I would like to read more about it, because it doesn't correspond to my experience or that of my children.  <BR> <BR>If you were in the South - the South does have a reputation for not having the greatest of schools.  <BR> <BR>My point is if you have friends who are academically good and you have mutual respect with them, the carping of others doesn't affect you much.  <BR> <BR>If you went to U. of Chicago you were first rate academically, and you may have had the misfortune of not having peers in your high school. <BR> <BR>My son, for instance, went to a magnet high school for science, such as exists in some major urban areas, and they had as much math as almost any kid could handle. <BR> <BR>On Wittgenstein (and Austin): <BR> <BR>It may be that some stuff that they said in linguistics was valuable, though I haven't heard what it is. Their idea that by analysing ordinary language you would disolve philosophical problems was wrong, and that is the heart of their philosophy.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally, I am not denying that Wittgenstein was a genius and powerful writer. It just that he was fundamentally wrong, and is a dead end path in philosophy.    <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

At this point, I believe that if I was a philosopher instead of a painter-cum-printer-cum-linguist-cum-journalist-cum-typographer I wouldn't think that Wittgenstein was as interesting as I do.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;&gt;the crappiness of humanities and social science scholarship in modern Western universities. <BR> <BR>My direct experience is as an undergrad, grad and lecturer in humanities and social science depts in English universities (old &amp; new). <BR>I think this problem is complicated by some important background factors which haven't been mentioned. <BR> <BR>1. There is a debate within the social sciences and humanities about the extent to which these disciplines should attempt to be 'scientific'. <BR>2. To answer the above question we need to know what we mean by 'scientific'. If we mean that the thought processes behind an investigation, the methods of an investigation and the interpretation of the results of an investigation have to be intellectually rigourous and meaningful, then we would need to extend our discussion to the crappiness of science departments in western universities. <BR> <BR>Believe me, I despise the sh1te-spouters who pollute academia, but its simply not good enough to tar all  humanities and social science departments with the same brush, while assuming that physics and chemistry departments are all shining examples of academic rigour. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I've scaned through the posts above (there are too many to read in the ten minutes i have left on my lunch) and this is what I've got to say. I live in Ireland, i've lived in San Francisco and I've been to Cuba. In San Fran your schoools look like prisions and I bet they feel like them too. This is not a point you can disregard, knowing how things look especially  fonts can radically change the feel of something. We in Ireland supposedly have one of the best education systems in Europe, but having said that I went to a school where 4 out of 120 students made it to college. And college here is free&hellip; In Cuba it is free also and a privilge. Most people who are first born Irish and living in the US return hame to educate their children. You have to wonder why they would choose to do that. In the US it's the System, the way education is taught that's the problem, not what is taught. You sing the national anthem every morning before school for god's sake. To me that sounds like brainwashing. That's the type of thing a dictator would make the kids do. <BR> <BR>Socially speaking, give me Cuba over the States anyday. Friendly, and perhaps the safest place I've ever been in my life. Party wise it's Ireland, but the States is the place to be if greenbacks you are after.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As regards U.S. vs. European universities (I'll keep Wittgenstein out of it ;-) <BR> <BR>My sister-in-law is from Poland, now living in Boston where my brother is in grad school. They're both architects, have worked professionally for about 6 years now, so she was attempting to get her license. Apparently, her BA from Poland doesn't fill the 'education requirement' for the licensing board. Which pisses her right off for this reason: <BR> <BR>Her degree program is said to lack the proper amount of 'humanities' courses. From my understanding, after her year of study in the states, she thinks U.S. schools are bollox (thanks Matha and Ian). In Poland they spend their time studying in architecture, maths, engineering, etc. In America we spend our time studying psychology, creative writing, music, etc. - things tangentially related to architecture at best.  <BR> <BR>Those are my misrepresentation of <i>her</i> views - not necessarily my own.
