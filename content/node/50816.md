body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nI would like to post a question.\r\nWhat is the best way to
  \"move\" vector drawings (sometimes with images), from freehand to Indesign?\r\n\r\nI've
  tried the following:\r\n\r\n1. Basic \"copy paste\"\r\n2. Export as eps and import
  into Indesign\r\n3. Build a pdf, and open in InDesign\r\n4. Use Illustrator as a
  \"buffer\" between the two apllications using \"copy paste\" method.\r\n\r\nDidn't
  get any conclusions and i still have problems mainly in files with images.\r\nHow
  can i preserve all atributtes such as color, stroke width, fonts, image size and
  position, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nRegards"

    could do that.\r\n\r\nFreehand has serious issues doing anything Adobe related,
    your on the right lines using illustrator as bridge between the two though. Have
    you tried exporting your freehand file as an illustrator 7.x file, and then opening
    that in illustrator? You should be able to find something inDesign friendly that
    way.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and much respect for holding up the freehand quarter!\r\n\r\n"

    you can, at least from FH11 to Illustrator CS3. The oposite it's way much different,
    triyng to paste something into freehand from any adobe apllications it's aparently
    impossible! Right now i'm having trouble even in pasting things from FH to photoshop.
    Freehand can be a pain sometimes.\r\n\r\n<cite>Have you tried exporting your freehand
    file as an illustrator 7.x file, and then opening that in illustrator?</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    didn't try that one, perhaps it will help. \r\n\r\nThanks for your reply"

  body: "I constantly move between applications (in various release versions), but
    just for vector images (not including bitmaps).\r\nProbably the most reliable
    way is:\r\n\r\nFreehand to InDesign:\r\nCopy using \"copy special\", with the
    option \"EPS\" format ticked.\r\nPaste in an Illustrator document / Copy\r\nPaste
    into an InDesign document.\r\n\r\nInDesign to Freehand:\r\nCreate a PDF file.\r\nOpen
    the PDF file in Illustrator / Copy\r\nPaste into Freehand.\r\n\r\nPlease note
    these important things: the copy/paste settings of the applications should be
    correctly set (in Illustrator you should choose to preserve paths, I don't recall
    the option precisely\u2026)\r\nNote also copyng and pasting text blocks results
    in an inconsistent behavior. In general, text objects can't be properly copy-pasted
    from an application to the other.\r\n\r\nAlso, using the \"EPS\" format with \"copy
    special\" allows to copy vector data from Freehand into FontLab without problems."

    but this approach may flatten things depending on your PDF Distiller settings
    and Freehand.

    behaviors as well.\r\nAlthough you can't copy into FreeHand direclty, I have discovered
    you can actually copy from InDesign to Illustrator, and it seems it goes for text
    objects as well\u2026 (I tried in InDesign CS2, but I suppose it's the same for
    other versions)."
