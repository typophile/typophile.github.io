body: Is there a way to find out ascender height, either as a percentage, or in points
  for a given point size?

  body: "Lots of ways, and different ways for different font formats, for different
    programming languages/environments/font editors, and different levels of expertise.\r\n\r\nOne
    such way would be to open an associated .afm file with a plain text editor, find
    the string \"Ascender\", and divide the number right after it by 10 to get a value
    as a percentage. Will of course only work for Type 1 fonts, but on the plus side,
    it's so easy anyone can do it."

    TTF/OTF <code>hhea</code> table, where you can find various measurements, but
    then again I know where to look for them.\r\n\r\nWhat is your ultimate purpose?
    Your platform? Programming language or other way or means you intend to use?"

  body: "Also: are we talking about the numeric value in the font file, or the actual
    height of the ascenders? Noting that (unless it's an RdR revival) you can't be
    totally sure of the latter.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: What I'm trying to do is align text to baseline grid in InDesign, but also
    have the ascenders touch the top of the text frame.

  body: "I think you can only do this reliably by going into the font. And if the
    ascenders have slanted head-serifs, you're going to have to decide where their
    <em>visual</em> top is.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "inktrap: InDesign lets you choose the top offset for a text frame. See \"First
    baseline offset options\" on [[http://help.adobe.com/en_US/indesign/cs/using/WSa285fff53dea4f8617383751001ea8cb3f-6fb2a.html|the
    online Help]].\r\n\r\nFor this to work, you cannot use a document-wide baseline
    grid (unless you \"manually\" set its starting position). Since the position of
    your first line is going to depend on the ascenders in the first line <em>of your
    current text frame</em>, they may differ from frame to frame; and hence, the position
    of the baseline grid, which starts at the bottom of that same first line.\r\n\r\nStore
    these settings in an Object style, so you can apply it to every frame where you
    need it."
