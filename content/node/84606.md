body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been working in indesign that has couple of same images repeated
  on page. The buzzar thing is that everytime I export it as a pdf but the images
  that was in the middle of the page dissapears wehere as other images are still there
  even theough all the links are from same file and is off the same image. \r\n\r\nIve
  tried many different things like\r\n- saving that link as jpg or tiff and relinking
  it. Still does the same. \r\n- The overprint has been checked \r\n- The layers have
  been checked. \r\n- I also thought of copy and pasting the whole page in photoshop
  and it pasted without that particular image in the middle. \r\n- Ive also checked
  the effects are all same. The links are all flattened files. \r\n\r\nPlease help
  Its driving me crazy. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Did you check the non-printing option in the attributes window?\r\nThis would
    hide the object when you create the pdf even if the link is\r\nthe same as on
    the other ogjects.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nIf the object is on its separate layer it
    could be that the layer is\r\nset to non-printing (usually the layer name would
    be in italics)"

  body: 'If I understand correctly, you''ve got other photo boxes that link to the
    same file and they are acting okay. So I''d suggest that you delete the photo
    box you''re having trouble with, then select (click on) one of the other photo
    boxes that''s acting properly and select Duplicate from the Edit menu to make
    a duplicate of that photo box,  then slide the duplicate box into position and
    make whatever adjustments are needed to the cropping and so forth. '

  body: Glad to be of assistance. I've occasionally had text or photo boxes act weird
    for unknown reasons, but replacing them with a new one usually fixes the problem.
