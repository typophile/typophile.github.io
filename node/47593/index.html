<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi!
I'm redoing the map to my college campus and the signage system in the college campus itself. The map is to work across a variety of mediums (Print, Web etc etc) and the Signage System is to work across a 4 disjointed campus. I'm looking for a font that's distinctive, readable when small, readable when large and of course, suited in style to a design college. Any ideas? Also looking for pics of an existing signage system (London underground, Charles de Gaulle Airport) smart enough to inspire.
Some fonts that I've thought of :
Satero Type system
Meta Type System
Century Gothic
Thanks in advance,
Arjun

<div class=commentbody>Some of the bigger metros are actually somewhat dull (although well done) if in part because their use by larger numbers of people and sheer number of sations starts to impede originality.
For example, comparing the Madrid and the Lisbon metro, the Madrid one uses Helvetica almost religiously, has gray or blue backgrounds for everything except the line colors, and is obviously designed to be efficient and easy to understand but very much in the background. The Lisbon one, with only four lines, has a much lighter feel to it, using more whites, curves, and a much more modern sans.
Are the campuses separated by fields? Or essentially distinct universities under one name? I would think you could make some interesting design decisions based on that.

<div class=commentbody>hi guifa,
My college has 4 campuses each one holding a different specialization... ie graphic design, film, experimental media etc... All of which are in different directions... Each campus also has a distinctive architecture different from all the rest (this wasn't intentional from what i can gather... it just happened that way)
I have a couple of interesting ideas like using 'super graphics' painting lines of color along the walls of each campus. Each line originates from entrance where a visitor would be able to find an index Key that would give him the line he ought to follow.
My real dilemma now is the font. What should i use that would have enough flexibility for both print and web?!?
