  releases-Stannard (a 1920's advertising inspired small caps face), Slattery (a  horizontally
  shaded fun face), and Vectis (classic Roman elegance, another small caps face)-
  on Greater Albion's [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]].\r\n\r\n"

    of ancient advertising typefaces but regarding your image sample file, why do
    you shade the type? It's totally not my concern, but I feel like it's wrong.\r\n\r\n
    \       Nice though :)"
