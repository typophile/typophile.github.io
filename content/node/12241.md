  Twardoch was 14 years old, Pope John Paul II laid a hand on his head, somewhere
  in a field in Poland. Since then, Adam has been on a holy mission to improve global
  typography. Especially the way that western designers draw their ogoneks.\r\n\r\nAdam
  currently works for [[FontLab]] Ltd. He lives in Germany, on the Polish border in
  a small town named Frankfurt an der Oder (not to be confused with the larger west
  German city with a similar name: Frankfurt am Main).\r\n\r\nAdam is also on the
  board of directors for the [[ATypI]], whom he also serves as the country delegate
  for Poland.\r\n\r\nwebsite: www.twardoch.com"
