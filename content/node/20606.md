  looking for so many different typefaces at once :)\r\n\r\nim planning to do a photographic
  book about systems, a research about visual systems and different degrees of chaos
  coming into organized, clean structures.\r\n\r\nmy initial thought was <a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Categories/Text+Fonts/Simple/\"
  target=\"_blank\">simple by norm</a>, but it was used SO often for cultural projects
  in switzerland that i'd like to find something else. the texts will be short, mainly
  captions for the photos.\r\n\r\nany ideas? thanks!"

  body: "thanks alot already for the suggestions. i should've written more about what
    im looking for.\r\n\r\nunivers was built systematicaly as a family, but not the
    glyphs itself - and thats what im looking for. simple consists of a few curve-segments
    that were used throughout the font, and its monospaced which adds to the \"systematic\"
    feeling.\r\n\r\nit doesnt have to have round terminals, it can have serifs or
    not, i really havent made up my mind. but the glyphs itself should be constructed
    with a system.\r\n\r\n\r\n(oh, and please do not suggest the normal din.. :))"

    starting point for the design was the angular font, so you have a kind of modular

    \r\n\r\nAll typefaces ARE systems, and they appear to be designed systematically,
    and some are done that way, but typefaces that look overtly systematic and rational
    are usually not very functional. Consider choosing a high-quality text typeface
    with some systematic \"feel\" to it, like ITC Tyfa, or Warnock, or Melior, or
    Proforma, rather than one derived literally from modules. The type in a publication
    doesn't have to refer so literally to the subject; it can simply evoke or sympathize
    with it.  \r\n"

    sure. but functionality isnt always the most important question, especially if
    you are making maybe 20 copies or so for friends and portfolio. its way too early
    to decide on a typeface anyway - i started this thread to get some fresh ideas
    i didnt think of. thinking about the typeface helps me getting more ideas for
    the photographic part. \r\nthe other way would be to make my own typeface, which
    im also making sketches for at the moment. opentype would be lovely for adding
    a chaotic part to the typeface."

    small audience of your friends represents a slice of the general public. Their
    feedback will be useful to you, especially if they are not designers. Any employer
    who interviews you will be able to comment on the project as well. Good luck!"

    Between his choices I would say Proforma is a totally \"rational\" masterpiece.
    If you still want to adhere to a grid concept more than a more functional design,
    Sys by Fabrizio Schiavi would be excellent, but it's too light. So I'd say Stephan's
    and Rodrigo Cavazos' Sophisto: fantastic and one of their best works.\r\n\r\nBTW
    Carl, I just realized I share with you a fascination for certain letterforms (see
    Reliq). In your \"about me\" page I see an image saying \"Photocopied tests\":
    could you tell me if you took inspiration from a specific source and if they led
    to a final design?"
