  to take on one of this years d&ad briefs. The one I have chosen is set by Research
  Studios and is to relauch Fuse Magazine and its 20th issue.\r\n\r\n<code>The brief\r\nRe-launch
  FUSE magazine by designing its 20th issue.\r\nMandatory requirements\r\nFUSE was
  seen as a revolution in both typography and the format it chose for publication.
  This re-launch should further this FUSE heritage.\r\nThroughout your concept and
  design you must feature a new, original font created specially for this issue. Your
  final presentation must include:\r\n\u2022 Format and examples of layout\r\n\u2022
  Complete font display\r\n\u2022 Promotional poster for the re-launch\r\n\u2022 Anything
  else you think is relevant\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIt can be read in full here: http://www.dandad.org/studentawards08/briefs/pdf/GRAPHIC_RESEARCHSTUDIOS.pdf\r\n\r\nResearch
  for this project has been fairly hard as I have not yet been able to even view a
  copy of Fuse Magazine.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where I can get hold of on? I am
  located in the United Kingdom. If not, any additional information would be appreciated.
  Or if someone has a copy at home a few scans would be great. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGustaf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeville

  body: jupiterboy, that's a different FUSE... Gus is talking about a set of experimental
    fonts that came in a box (on floppy disks), along with a poster. Each issue had
    a theme, and the guest designers had to make a typeface using that theme as inspiration.

    scanning in some sample or something if you have access to a scanner? Would be

  body: "As I have been working with this project for the last week I have come to
    the conclusion that I really need to set myself a theme to be able to define within
    what area my work will land. \r\n\r\nMany themes that I have thought about has
    come back to some type of geometics etc.. although I would like some theme that
    is just something completely different. An earlier competition set by Research
    Studios was \"Security\" which I thought was a pretty good one.\r\n\r\nThe themes
    that I have thought of sort of feels pretty pointless so far, <strong>anyone got
    any ideas for a good theme?</strong>\r\n\r\nCould be pretty much anything! Whatever
    you can think of, write it down!"

    be a better project if you come up with the brief. Don't cheat yourself."

  body: "Yeah, I pretty much would just like to see on what level what I have written
    down so far compares.\r\n\r\nA war theme is something that has been poping around
    in my head for a while today. Could be a good way to go ahead considering the
    uk's participation in the iraq war etc.. Its a way I think could have been handled
    a bit differently, if that is even possible for someone who has not been there
    to say, at least from what has been displayed in media here, also considering
    the different things that the media has reported in this country and some of the
    issues that has been completely disregarded (Media from other countries has aired
    some other stories which seems to have been blacklisted here).\r\n\r\nAs It might
    end up as a pictogram typeface, the items of war and geometrics would work nicely
    together.\r\n\r\n<strong>Edit:</strong> If anyone knows what typeface was used
    for the FUSE logo, that information would be appreciated. I have used this image
    to check in What-Is-The-Font etc as well but without any good matches. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fuse
