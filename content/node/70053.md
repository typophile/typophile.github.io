  a string replacement via opentype programming? you know, it's possible to replace
  ligatures \r\n\r\n<b>sub f f by ff;</b>\r\n\r\nhowever is it possible to do something
  like this?\r\n\r\n<b>sub a b by c d;</b>\r\n\r\nSo if i type \"ab\" i get \"cd\"?\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your help and your tips."
