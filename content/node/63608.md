  frequently, but I had no luck searching within the forum.\r\n2. My lack of knowledge
  about this subject makes it virtually impossible for me to be very specific, so
  I would just like some general estimates/guesses in response to my inadequate question.\r\n\r\nI
  am setting a book using InDesign. My client is undecided about self-publishing or
  using a publishing company. (My client has several agents who are interested in
  handling the book.) I need to get a rough estimate of how much it would cost to
  print a professional quality paperback book in standard format, (about 5\"x8\"),
  approximately 300 pages in length, with back and front cover in color. My question
  involves only printing production costs for 1000 copies. Artwork and typesetting
  will be provided by yours truly.\r\n\r\nI fully realize that my lack of details
  will result in less-than-happy responses, but all I need is a very rough approximation!\r\n\r\nThanks
  Much!\r\nDK~\r\n"

    should come to, well, no more than a few hundred dollars -- an hourly rate is
    fair <em>if</em> you know your way around InDesign.\r\n\r\nBiggest part of the
    printing costs is setting up and get started; only with more than 300 or 400 copies,
    time and paper are going to kick in. Binding sheets into real books is mostly
    a flat fee, though.\r\n\r\nWhy not ask a quotation from one or more printers in
    your neighbourhood? They are a friendly lot, and when given the opportunity, they
    will tell you what to ask next time."

    print-on-demand, as Chris links above.\r\n\r\nAnother to consider would be [[http://www.bookmobile.com/|BookMobile]]."

    sell in the multi thousands. I find Theunis' price estimate may be a bit low.\r\n\r\nA
    Canadian company that specializes in books (yearbooks, history texts, etc.) is
    http://www.friesens.com/. They would be willing to provide a more complete quote.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "<cite>I find Theunis\u2019 price estimate may be a bit low.</cite>\r\n\r\nAh,
    right. That would come out to a production cost of about $2.00 per 300 page book
    -- a bit on the low side. I'd change that to an estimate of $5 to $8 per book,
    retailing for something inbetween $50 and $80.\r\n\r\nI don't think a 1,000 copy
    run can be done with Printing-on-Demand for that price."

    love lulu, but\r\nyou use lulu for one-offs, not a run of 1000 copies.\r\n\r\nyou
    should also consider _distribution_.  unless you\r\nactually _want_ to handle
    the distribution, or unless\r\nall the books are going to just a handful of locations,\r\nit
    might be good to go with a printer (like lightning,\r\nor createspace) which is
    willing to handle fulfillment.\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n"
