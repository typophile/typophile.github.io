body: "I was looking at how arabic type designs have been using metrics today. I was
  wondering what you all think is best practice for various non latin designs. In
  my case I am most concerned with Arabic but I don't see what this thread has to
  be limited to that.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I have seen ( my sample size is far
  too small for this to be representative of an industry approach) is that Arabic
  type that includes latin glyphs will use x and cap height values. But those that
  do not don't. Or more accurately they make the value for both cap & x heights near
  the baseline. The idea I have about this is that rendering engines use x heights
  & cap height to normalize the presentation of latin type for screen and in print
  and so maybe taking these values out of play by dropping them to -1 prevents undesired
  \"normalization\" of the Arabic shapes which vary in height quite a lot.\r\n\r\nBonus
  points for talking about working outside the em square vs keeping all marks including
  diacritics within it."

    really. The first thing to note is that the set of metrics to which you refer
    are PS-specific, and not of significant impact in OpenType. They are useful to
    set in FontLab primarily for design and vertical alignment setting (BlueZone or
    corresponding TT hinting alignment). But it is those alignment zones, not the
    metrics, that affect rendering.\r\n\r\nYou shouldn't make Arabic-only fonts. For
    technical reasons, every font should support at least one complete 8-bit codepage,
    which implies at least a subset of Latin characters. If you look at the Linotype
    Arabic fonts, for example, you'll see that they all contain a set of best-match
    Latin glyphs from other fonts in the Linotype library, scaled to harmonise with
    the Arabic.\r\n\r\nIf you do have only Arabic glyphs to work with, my inclination
    would be to set the cap height to match the ascender height, and to set the x-height
    somewhere around the top of the middle-band of the Arabic, e.g. at the top of
    the bowl of the tah.\r\n\r\nFor bonus points:\r\n\r\nSince most Arabic text uses
    few marks -- only shadda is used with some frequency in non-vocalised text --,
    I consider it quite safe for mark heights to be beyond the em. Users working with
    vocalised text will know to increase the leading. What the marks should not do
    is extend beyond the OS/2 WinAscent and WinDescent heights, or they will be clipped.\r\n\r\nNote,
    however, that the OS/2 Win metrics values will be used to determine default linespacing
    in almost all Windows apps, which means that the default linespacing of Arabic
    fonts tends to be very loose in order to accomodate marks that most of the time
    will not be present. You can get around this by using a version 4 OS/2 table and
    setting fsSelection bit 7 to have applications use the Os/2 Typo values for linespacing
    instead of the Win values. This requires editing the OS/2 table post-FontLab.
    [Note that a version 4 table also requires you to make decisions about fsSelection
    bits 8 and 9.]\r\n\r\n[This discussion probably belongs in the Build forum.]"
