<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi Everyone, <br> <br>It was great to meet so many of you for the first time and to catch up with TypeCon friends who I had fallen out of touch with. I'd like to echo some of you who have already stated just how informative and friendly the conference is. I'm simply amazed at how well it has progressed. The very first one set the tone and it is still ringing true. Okay, that's a bit cheesy but you know what I mean.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mike Parker tells the story: <br> <br>Once a young salesman was peddling new-fangled <br>dictation machines that worked by recording speech <br>for playback later. He managed to gain entrance to the <br>Mergenthaler offices on Ryerson Street in Brooklyn and <br>was shown to C.H. Griffith's office. The young man <br>recorded a brief conversation with Mr. Griffith. He then <br>played it back to CHG. Upon hearing the voice issue <br>from the machine, Griffith declared gruffly, "I never <br>said that!" <br> <br><i>>too busy looking for photos of Kent Lew on the dancefloor.</i> <br> <br>I never did that. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, I'm slowly getting back to reality. <br> <br>TypeCon was great and it was wonderful to meet so <br>many of you. I think, for the most part, I was able to <br>express to you just how much I admire some of you <br>and what wonderful inspirations you are. If I didn't <br>get the chance this year, I'm <br>hoping for the next. I'm planning to be there and <br>I hope you will be as well. <br> <br>The highlights were many and the biggest was of course <br>being in the same room as all of you. <br> <br>Other great points, for me, were; <br> <br>1) <b>Peter Bilak's presentation</b> <br>2) <b>Stuart's LazyDrinker</b> <br>3) <b>Some great spacing and kerning files <br>from Bitstream</b> <br>4) <b>Knowing I can only do better on next <br>years type quiz.</b> <i>( I actually won the most <br>typographically challenged prize. Thanks Keith and Tiffany, <br>for humoring me and grading my test. )</i> <br> <br>There are way to many good things to talk about. <br> <br>I should try to post later when I am more together. <br>It is actually a little hard to get my head around it all. <br> <br><b>The biggest surprise;</b> Kent on the dance floor. <br> <br>Kent, you can really tear a rug up!

<div class=commentbody>Glad to meet and talk to many of you. Because of TypeCon, I have about four new projects (both design and research) I want to pursue. I rarely ever write anything down, but I kept digging out my pink pad to jot down what was running through my head. For a young guy like me, this was a great experience. It was very inspiring. Thanks, everyone.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, Hrant -- <br> <br>Matthew was commissioned recently to create a new <br>design to be cut in wood type by the Hamilton Wood <br>Type & Printing Museum in Two Rivers, WI. (Carter says <br>the invitation caused him to realize that wood was, in <br>fact, a technology that he had never created type for <br>before.) His design is an all-caps, chunky, latin-serif <br>design and is called Carter Latin. One of the more <br>notable aspects of the design is that it has two variants <br>-- a positive and a negative -- which can be combined <br>for interesting figure-ground interrelationships. The <br>typeface is done, but the font is still being manufactured, <br>I think. Matthew confessed that last weekend was the <br>first time he's actually seen it. It will be available in <br>wood, one size only for now, I believe -- 12-line (about <br>2 inches). <br> <br>There's nothing about this project on the <a href=http://www.woodtype.org target=_blank> Hamilton website</a> yet. <br> <br>Matthew has the rights to produce a digital font, but says <br>he's not inclined to do it any time soon, so that the <br>Hamilton can have a measure of exclusivity for a while. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>Speaking of Hamilton, did anyone notice that Chank sells a digital version of the Offset face that was presented? <br> <br>Yes. Hamilton Offset was presented in the Goldstein Gallery at the University of Minnesota earlier this year. I had the pleasure of admiring the type at that time and after a quick google search discovered that the font was already available digitally. Unfortunately I missed 98% of Carter's presentation, but it's exciting that the Hamilton Woodtype Museum is undertaking the creation of new typefaces in wood.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The process for creating the Hamilton Offset typeface was interesting. It reminded me of the deconstructed type in the 90s, but it's far from it. I think it's great that they are still interested in making new woodtype. Matthew Carter's design is great. And as expected, he did something that's just a little bit different!

<div class=commentbody>The funniest thing at TypeCon: <br>When Si introduced himself as moderator of the Blog and <br>Communities panel and said, "I'm Si Daniels and I work for <br>Microsoft. Sorry about that." <br> <br>The most frustrating moment: <br>Scoring a 6 on that *lousy type quiz (okay 8, if I give myself <br>2 points for getting my name right). I had to second <br>Stephen's assertion that it needed some questions from <br><i>this</i> half of the last century. (*No offense Kent, it's just <br>that you have to come down to the rest of our levels to <br>speak to us. Haha. I guess next year I should do some <br>homework.) <br> <br>The warmest fuzzy: <br>Realizing that the people you've looked up to forever are <br>genuinely warm, friendly people. (Awww.) <br> <br>The truest prediction: <br>Jill Bell lamented that the Mac OS Finder should be able to <br>recognize and activate fonts by double clicking them. The <br>guy from Apple granted her wish 4 hours later when he <br>gave a demo of Apple's Mac OS X update, Panther (Mac OS <br>X 2.6). <br> <br>The strangest moment: <br>Sitting at lunch with Delve Withrington, hoping he doesn't <br>notice me staring, thinking <i>Is he really an immortal vampire?</i> <br>By the end of the conference I still couldn't tell... <br> <br>The second worst moment: <br>Realizing that our room did not have high speed internet <br>access. <br> <br>The worst moment: <br>Realizing that, not only did our room not have high speed <br>internet access, but that the hotel's "business center" <br>consisted of a single PC and a single chair in a closet-sized <br>space that was constantly occupied. (I humbly suggest that <br>TypeCon '04 be held at San Francisco's wireless enabled <br>Herbst Theater or similarly equipped venue for us tech- <br>spoiled kids.) <br> <br>Biggest regret: <br>Flying on Priceline. Leaving Sunday morning. Essentially we <br>missed the one day of the conference that was dominated <br>by people of my own generation -- Test Pilot, Miniml, <br>Aesthetic Apparatus among others. <br> <br>The simplest pleasure: <br>Watching Jim Parkinson beaming like a proud parent over <br>the pages of Indie Fonts 2. The book itself was a catalyst <br>for a pile of his recent releases. I'm sure he was both <br>relieved to have the work done and proud of the showings. <br>Note to self: invite Jim over for Sunday dinner sometime. <br> <br>Funnest time: <br>Sharing a panel with Si, Jon, Armin, Stephen and Jared. <br>There were some genuine good laughs. I'm glad we could <br>pull off a smoke screen so that not everyone realized <br>that we were sitting up there modeling the emperor's new <br>wardrobe.</div>
