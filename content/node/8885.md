  body: Jacob, first off, I&#39;d ditch 3a-4b. I&#39;ve seen this design a million
    times and it doesn&#39;t say &#39;landscaping&#39; to me. <BR> <BR>Right now,
    I&#39;d say 1a and 1b are stronger, as they are, than 2a and 2b. Only because
    the grass in the 2 versions looks more like hair to me. Otherwise, I prefer the
    visual concept in the 2s. Push the grass more towards blades, rather than spikes.
    <BR> <BR>I think 1a and 1b are a bit generic, but workable. Try to make the type
    and leaf feel like more of a unit, rather than type and a leaf. Also, the central
    vein in a leaf is just an extension of the stem, so you should draw them as one
    central curve. It&#39;s the &#39;spine&#39; of the leaf, so be conscious of that
    when you draw it. <BR> <BR>And finally, ask the client how they want to be perceived.
    Right now you&#39;ve got a heavy bias towards modern, clean type, which makes
    me think that&#39;s what you&#39;re shooting for, but that will help the other
    decisions fall into place. <BR> <BR>Oh, and that secondary green/screen is too
    light. <BR> <BR>Generally, the 1-2 ideas aren&#39;t bad, they&#39;re just not
    great. Keep refining.

  body: 'Cris the reason you see the cliches in landscaping is that landscaping is
    more than plants its more about the whole environment including walking paths.
    I don&#39;t think they should be resorting to cliches, but I feel more research
    is needed. Questions like: Is it a family business with a good name? Is the business
    well known? What is the competition doing? I think less work more research is
    in order.'

  body: If it was a terraced hill or something then I wouldn&#39;t mind so much. The
    path/river between two hills receding into the skyline says a whole lot of things
    to me, but not landscaping. I agree though, more research is a good bet.

  body: Thanks for the input guys, this is great!  <BR>I have made some changes to
    the &#34;grass&#34; logo, made it look a little more like grass. My only concern
    with it is that it looks like an unmaintained &#40;i dont think thats a word,
    but oh well&#41; Lawn and that isnt exactly the image they want, let me know what
    you think. <BR> <BR>i have also modified the leaf logo and made it interact with
    the type. i have a feeling that the type isnt dense enough though.  <BR> <BR>Also
    I have attempted to add some colour as it seemed very drab. <BR> <BR>once again
    any input would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64133.jpg"

  body: I like 3 a lot. The leaf could perhaps be a bit smaller. <BR> <BR>As for the
    grass, I&#39;m just seeing magnified close-ups of body hair. Grass doesn&#39;t
    actually taper, and it&#39;s much more thick &#40;or, at least should be if your
    landscaping company is doing it&#39;s job ;o&#41;

    where i thought it might.  <BR> <BR>I really want to introduce some colour but
    not sure how to go about it, the client Definetly wants green in there <BR> <BR>Here

  body: Jacob, I agree with you that the grass looks unkempt. Also, it still reads
    as hair to me in 1a, 1b, and 2. Check out <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/rush723/school/home1.html">this
    image</a> to see what I mean by a blade of grass. Grass is essentially just long,
    narrow leaves. Like leaves, they start thin, swell, and come to a point. Your
    grass starts thick and comes to a point, more like a hair. The curve in 4 looks
    more like grass to me than the grass does. <BR> <BR>As Daniel pointed out, landscaping
    is not just about plants, but about <i>shaping</i> the land and the plant life
    on it. It&#39;s design as well, so more overt rhythm and pattern are probably
    ok as long as the forms feel natural. I&#39;d pull away from your specific ideas
    and return to sketching and research for a bit.

  body: Also, it might be good to look at a sans with a bit more organic grace, particularly
    in the strokes. Something like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=FF.1536.2.7">Advert</a>,
    for example. <BR> <BR>Futura feels too Constructivist and geometric for landscaping
    and natural forms. It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s something you need to counterbalance
    when designing the logo.

  body: Maybe it&#39;s just me &#40;and it usually is&#41; but I think that the original
    post&#39;s v 1a is awesome, just ditch the leaf. I see the two flourishes against
    &#34;landscaping co&#34; as a hill, on which that type sits. I don&#39;t think
    that you need such a literal leaf and grass approach. This is a perfect chance
    to experiment with type and it&#39;s ability to create illusions of depth and
    allusions to other imagery. Push it! <BR> <BR>aaron

  body: The last one looks better. It still have some problem with the word - landscaping.
    May be the problem is his weight or his color or his position. You could try a
    darker green for landscaping. <BR> <BR>Other solution. Have you try a ligtht or
    a darker green  large line &#40;to look like the ground or the underground&#41;
    under the name and reverse landscaping in white .
