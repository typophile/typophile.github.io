  Mostly to devise and establish annual event, and sponsorship plans, as well as public
  relations and conference organisers. Most of their clients are corporate sector.\r\n\r\nThe
  client wanted a logo with cingularesque look, like abstract views of a meeting or
  people communicating. They also wanted an appealing and charismatic shape.\r\n\r\nThe
  logo: The clients wanted a personality / human feel, not just another marketing
  firm or a brand management not as they exist on data sheets but in peoples minds.
  The two shapes an ascending joined piece, meeting or people communicating...facing
  each other on positive right direction, only to show ascension, growth, positivity,
  forward etc. \r\n\r\nI'd appreciate suggestions on how can I tighten it up the logo
  so it holds together as a unified form? I feel something is missing or how can I
  infuse it with a bit more energy? "

    I've in mind. I'll drop the colours then and I've updated with amended concepts.
    I still feel something is missing or how can I infuse it with a bit more energy
    without looking like Bahamas Logo?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opts2_3671.gif]"

    the approach of the logo...they're sticking to their cingularesque look, like
    abstract views of a meeting or people communicating. I'll try and play around
    and I'll see what I'll come up with.\r\n\r\nThank you DOGG for pointing out Moen."

    isn\u2019t a unique shape, although it is rarer than a regular polygon, it is
    will turn up now and again \u2013 the treatment is the key. Rather than point
    out similarities (I don\u2019t think Moen really counts) the type will benefit
    from better kerning, \u2018ener\u2019 and \u2018communicates\u2019 are very tight
    and in the case of \u2018communicates\u2019 too small. It is crucial to test logos
    at the sizes that they will be used at \u2013 start with a business card up to
    the side of a van or exhibition panel. The g and y are currently a bit wide and
    light compared to the density of \u2018ener\u2019, whether they should be adapted
    or the \u2018ener\u2019 altered is up to you. I enjoy the two storey g versions
    although both the characters are facing in the same direction, perhaps the bottom
    storey could be reflected.\r\n\r\nTim"

    the letter g is  still wide and I've reduced the width of Y. I'm aware the \u2018ener\u2019
    and \u2018communicates\u2019 are very tight and in the case of \u2018communicates\u2019
    is too small.\r\n\r\nFor now I just want to focus the logo itself and get it right
    of abstract views of a meeting or people communicating.\r\n- the the two storey
    g versions\r\n- reflected the two storey g versions.\r\n- four shapes all in the
    same direction except the green one to give the impression of public relations
    and conference. \r\n\r\nI'd appreciate your thoughts on modified concepts and
    which one work the best?\r\n\r\nThe logo wil never be on a van or on a TV!!! Most
    definity on printed stationery, website, company literate, promotions, ads, pull
    up stands & t-shirts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opts_3704...gif]"

  body: "Alma,\r\n\r\nI don't think you are ever going to see \"energy\" in these
    current iterations.  Everything here is very static and sedate.  If you want energy,
    look at size relationships and interactions between the elements in the logo and/or
    the type.  The lowercase 'g' could be revised so the point in the counter points
    up to the right, then maybe you could have some of your other elements extend
    from that, almost like it was sparking or something.  It'll require a bit of work
    to get there, though.  And while color can be part of the equation here, it shouldn't
    be the only one.  The form itself should give off enough energy and dynamism that
    a lack of color won't undo it.\r\n\r\nAlso, \"communicates\" is still way too
    small to be readable on a business card. Your original lockup is better, albeit
    still too-tightly letterspaced."

    Try a less geometric typeface, something warmer and friendlier. Also the difference
    in type size between "energy" and "communicates" is too great - meaning the smaller
    text isn't legible when the logo is printed small.

    looks OK by itself, but it appears too static for the word "energy".
