  body: The best measure of a bitmap font is from top of lc ascenders to bottom of
    lc descenders, so this is best called an &#34;8 point&#34; &#40;or &#34;8 pixel&#34;&#41;
    design. Anyway, it&#39;s nice! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    But actually, that bit was opinion more than knowledge. In fact some people &#40;including
    me a few years ago&#41; would have counted one pixel of &#34;internal leading&#34;
    as part of any bitmap font &#40;so Micromorph would be a 9&#41;, but then I realized
    that: <BR>1&#41; The &#34;big boys&#34; &#40;like the MS core fonts&#41; measure
    it flush. <BR>2&#41; It&#39;s rare for the descenders of a line to run into the
    ascenders of the following line, so it&#39;s not worth &#34;wasting&#34; the measure.
