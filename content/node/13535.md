body: Established in 1996, Larabie Fonts features more than 250 fonts designed by
  [[Ray Larabie]] of Ontario, Canada. "It started out as a hobby and people seemed
  to enjoy the website," says Ray and he can't be wrong judging by how well it has
  been reviewed in magazines, newspapers and on television. He designed the site to
  make viewing and downloading the fonts fun and easy. Donations keep the site online
  and ad-free.
