  body: I was thinking along the lines of <i>letter shape simplification</i> when
    I made the comparison to the bauhaus. However, I can see how the word shapes in
    Hrant&#39;s sample do show the concept of which you speak JF. It is interesting
    that this is so apparent. I&#39;m going to look through some books. Although the
    visual tie to the bauhaus is still there for me, perhaps it is not Massin whom
    I am really reminded. <BR> <BR>Hrant, do you have more samples? Are you working
    on more?

    of other strange diagrams and such too. Stay posted! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    What might be relevant in this thread is a comparison of the two alphabets made
    by Dreyfuss for Javal &#40;although it&#39;s not clear how much direct guidance

    I had to look up a couple of words but still can&#39;t extract any possible reasoning.

    Although the more I look at this design the more I want to do it myself! :-/ It
    seems to represent that &#34;missing link&#34; even more than I originally thought.
    I realized this in looking at the italic &#40;for which I was happy to find a

    target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Javal_italic.gif</a> <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s a slanted roman of the highest order - the best I&#39;ve ever seen.
    Not a result of saving money &#40;like the ATF slanted romans&#41;, but an ideology
    tempered with typographic intelligence &#40;unlike the fanatical approach of Morison&#41;.
    I thought my Patria italic was progressive - this is much more so. And it was
    designed over a hunder years ago! <BR> <BR>But the roman is no slouch either.
    The whole seems to be what the Grandjean/Jaugeon effort was <i>supposed</i> to
    be, without the sterility of the Didone class. A new well of possibilities! <BR>
    <BR>-- <BR> <BR>The thing is, Chris, I&#39;m not sure you even need me. There
    <i>must</i> be good specimens of this design. I think you should ask JFP for help
    in tracking those down &#40;and in making sure nobody already has the rights to
    it - which I highly doubt&#41;. What you&#39;d be looking for is Maison Deberny
    specimens from the late 19th century, or very early 20th. <BR> <BR>But let me
    know if you have other preferences of how to do this. Hey, maybe we should make

    as AMG seems fascinating, I don&#39;t need anything from it right now if you have
    actual Deberny specimens of the fonts in question. The fonts were made under the
    direction of Tuleu some time between 1878 and 1905, but I guess they were still
    selling them in 1923. They strike me as the sort of thing Charles Peignot wouldn&#39;t
    have liked, so maybe by the next specimen they got rid of them? Anyway, that&#39;s
    just a side question. <BR> <BR>&#62; switches to a one story &#34;g.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>First: switching to a monocular &#34;g&#34; for the display sizes makes perfect
    sense to me &#40;it&#39;s great to see some people had already realized that and
    actually implemented it long ago&#42;&#41; because the binocular &#34;g&#34; is
    great for readability, but lacks harmony with the rest of the alphabet during
    conscious appreciation. I will be doing what Tuleu did in my own text fonts from
    now on. <BR> <BR>&#42; I also like that old French style of old-style figures
    &#40;with the 3 and 5 ascending&#41; more than our general convention. <BR> <BR>That
    &#34;g&#34; is actually why I thought the #17 was the one I wanted. In the Javal
    book &#40;which uses the #17 and the #18&#42;&#41; he shows a sample of the #16
    at 30 point, and it has the mono &#34;g&#34;. So I thought the #17 was the one
    I wanted. I&#39;m still a little bit confused though because he also shows a 5
    point sample of #16, and that has the mono &#34;g&#34; as well&#42;&#42;. So I
    would most like to see samples of #15-#16 I guess. What do you see as the differences
    between them? And what are the chances you could provide a hi-res scan of the
    full character set? <BR> <BR>&#42; Javal mentions the #18 as being a variation
    on the #17 &#40;with longer descenders, bringing the 9 point forms to 10 point&#41;.
    Not sure where it ended up. BTW, he also mentions the 8 point #17 as being a short-descender
    version of its 9 point - which would make it a nice cheap method of optical scaling.
    <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; Could they have switched to a mono &#34;g&#34; at the bottom
    range as well, to cater to legibility?! That would rule even more. <BR> <BR>In
    case you&#39;re wondering why Chris and I like this design: <BR>I think Chris
    likes it because he likes it &#40;the best reason!&#41;, while I like it mostly
    because of its evolutionary singularity: it&#39;s like a &#34;missing&#34; offshoot
    from the Romain du Roi. I&#39;ve been reading up on Fournier, Baskerville, Bodoni,
    Luce and Didot, and none of them are even close to it. Not even Grandjean had

  body: "I have been studying this work by Emile Javal, so naturally have ended up
    here.\r\n\r\nI should mention that the reference to page 226 makes more sence
    if you look on page 225 where M. Telu gets a mention as does the beginning of
    the turned paragraph thanks \u2018La maison Deberny\u2019.\r\n\r\nI think seeing
    the series 16 type as the missing link is interesting.\r\n\r\nAs I try to transcribe
    and create a gist translation of Chapter XVII, I see that some of M. Javal talks
    about is a typographic missing link. He is making many observations some of which
    I have not specifically had related to me before, but were more inert understandings.
    \r\n\r\nHe does have a somewhat methodical approach conducting his own experiments
    (apparently at home) and takes those results as a basis for his criticism.\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if M. Javal consulted with M. Telu at Deberney et Cie in the development
    of series 16 (He and M. Telu definatly communicated), or that his finding are
    much based on what was relayed to him by M. Telu. M. Javal taking it upon himself
    to push typography further. \r\n\r\nIt has been good to see that kakaze continued
    with research and developed \"Telu\" - Good!\r\n\r\nhttp://home.cfl.rr.com/kakaze/type/tuleuspecimen.pdf\r\n\r\n/u1\r\n\r\n"

    they are not exact replicas - M. Javal insists that there is room for improvement
    as noted by Hrant - it is for you to judge if indeed M. Huot-Marchand has succeeded
    where M. Drefuss probably began to find the criticism tiresome and gave up! (Conjecture)."

  body: "Notes accompanying my previous post:\r\n\r\nUntitled \u2013 Size 5, (Experimental
    typeface proposal), 1905 [Charles Dreyfuss/\xC9mile Javal].\r\n\r\nDrefuss and
    Javal produced two sets of experimental letterforms embodying the principles set
    out in \xC9mile Javal\u2019s book. The following study looks at the \u201Csize
    5\u201D, the larger of the two unless direct comparisons are made. The font lacks
    typographic niceties, so looks unusual compared to other more refined typefaces
    like Fleischmann and Didot. Indeed the letters look like caricatures or cartoons
    of letterforms where their visual features are exaggerated. \r\n\r\nThe bold nature
    of the design means that it will still be visible at very small sizes. Shapes
    are used with non reliance on the counters. Other ways have been introduced to
    differentiate characters from each other. The act of identification of the letters
    is more important than the act of reading, therefore the set of letters lack cohesion.
    Because the letters are made up of even width strokes and geometric forms, the
    tops of the characters tend to have the same appearance density. Javal himself
    points out that the top half of the letters are important in identifying the character,
    however the type developed from his ideas lacks adherence to this observation.\r\n\r\nIn
    the type example given in the book [particuli\xE8re se (fig. 68) p.229] some of
    the more challenging letters (in terms of structure) are omitted. These include
    the letters  k, j, y and z. This means that the Javal \u2018Size 5\u2019 proposal
    lacks a full set of characters which would have gone a long way to prove his case.
    Non completion of the character set possibly have contributed to a negative effect
    on the popularisation of his ideas.\r\n\r\nIt is noted that the s looks very similar
    to the lowercase Didot s, which looks out of place with the other characters.
    The s does seem to be one of the most challenging letters when it comes to reduction
    and exhibiting it at a small size. The s could look to the proposed z from the
    smaller character set as a potential solution.\r\n\r\nBibliography:\r\nJaval,
