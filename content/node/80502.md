  body: In Valerie, I read the 'V' as 'N' and the 'r' as 'n' initially.

  body: I agree with Aaron. Maybe the circle above the 'i' should be slightly (and
    only slightly) smaller? Apart from that I quite like the feel. It's romantic and
    modern.

  body: "Thanks guys! Is this better?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Names2_5770.gif]\r\nLegibility
    is definitely improved now, but since it's an invitation that'll only be send
    to friends & family it's ok if aesthetics have the upperhand as long as the names
    remain recognisable enough."

  body: It's much better now. The only thing I don't like is Roland's n which I think
    should match the a and d more.

  body: "Changed the n, but also changed the V back to its original tilted version
    (though slightly adjusted) since I feel it works better in the total design.\r\nI
    used some fleurons I made about a year ago to add a little elegance while still
    keeping it very simple & clean. Also played with 2 different stroke weights to
    add a little depth.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Example_6072.gif]\r\nDid
    another version of the n that fits the a & d better as well, but that makes it
    look too modular in my opinion.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlternateN_3685.gif]"

  body: I think the ascenders on /l/ and /d/ look a little stunted relative to the
    rest.

  body: Try moving the circle part of the V higher up - it might make the V less N-like;
    maybe match it to the height of the R. Overall it looks great! Love that ampersand.

  body: Maybe you could lighten the swash of the V, like you did in the ornaments.
    Personally I don't like the first n in Roland. Noone would actually write it that
    way. The second one is much better. Also the o is a bit elevated, was this intentional?

  body: I actually had to abandon this approach. The initial 'carte blanche' I was
    given had to make room for an idea from the couple to be wed. They found a text
    online they want to use for the invitation & want the design to match it. The
    text is something along the lines of 'the front door is still the same, but inside
    something has changed'. They now want that to feature on the front of the card
    along with a picture of a door (preferably having the card itself resemble the
    door) :-S

  body: "Oh yes. Good idea! Double flapped card. It will be hard to make it so the
    \"doors\" will align perfectly, but it would seem really good. You'd then open
    up with all the wedding info inside.\r\n\r\nReally nice but hard to create.\r\n\r\nJust
    make sure that you open a new thread because it won't have anything to do with
    this custom lettering that this thread is for. (actually if you'll need a thread
    for it)."

    that they liked. I ended up leaving the typography to the experts & only used
    the ampersand & fleurons in the final design.\r\nIt's a three-fold in B/W with
    a coloured patterned back.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Invitation_6513.jpg]"
