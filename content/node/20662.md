  body: "You guys are fantastic!\r\n\r\nThanks for that. By any chance could you offer
    your opinions on the attached.\r\nFor legibility and aesthetics do you think it
    is better to break the name (my design business) apart?\r\n\r\nAre there any similar
    fonts that you could recommend or prefer to this font, that I could look into
    also? I really like the \"I\". One thing that is concerning me is the overall
    length of the line (obviously business name is long) and I guess this goes with
    the script font style, any suggestions on a more compact script perhaps.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help, cheers\r\n\r\nJason\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a33e50040ca61efe6232fdda2b206aed-1_5899.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/a33e50040ca61efe6232fdda2b206aed_6739.png]"

    it subconciously off putting to see such a\r\nlong word.\r\n\r\nPhil"

    some time! \r\nNot to keen on the Capital \"M\" of that font, maybe it's a little
    hard to interpret. May look for a different font or refine the M to my tastes.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    doing that anyway, as you will then have \r\na custom marque for your company.

    of legibility, partly because the word 'mechanics' \r\nis fairly recognisable
    anyway. \r\n\r\nPhil"
