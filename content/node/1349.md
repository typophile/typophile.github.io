  body: yes. I did. But I still like to have a &#34;consumer&#34; perspective before
    I give out my cc#. I&#39;ve had my number &#34;borrowed&#34; off the net before
    &#40;and it was from a secured site&#41;. Guess I&#39;m just a little sensitive
    these days about unknown sites.

    Do not redistribute <BR>the fonts you purchase from Professional Fonts, we will

    this is from the About Us... <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>About
    Professional Fonts <BR> <BR>How can we bring you quality fonts at such low prices?
    <BR>The answer lies in our three operating principals. <BR> <BR>Volume <BR>We
    negotiate with the owners of existing font libraries for <BR>the rights to distribute
    their fonts. These &#39;block sales&#39; mean <BR> large chunks of money for the
    library owners up front, in <BR>exchange for us being able to bring the individual
    fonts to <BR>market at whatever price we choose. If you are the owner <BR>of a
    font library &#40;at least 100 fonts please&#41; and would like <BR>to receive
    a signifigant one time payment for the rights to <BR>distribute, contact Alicia
    in our acquisitions department. <BR><a href="mailto:Acquisitions@ProfessionalFonts.com">Acquisitions@ProfessionalFonts.com</a>.  <BR>
    <BR>Simplicity <BR>To keep our costs low, we cannot offer technical support on
    <BR>the fonts you purchase from us. If you need high quality <BR>technical support,
    may we suggest purchasing your models <BR>from Fonts.com. You&#39;ll pay a lot
    more, but you&#39;ll also <BR>receive great tech support. Also, we only distribute
    the <BR>most popular fonts, and only for the PC platform. <BR> <BR>Automation
    <BR>Our system of font packaging and distribution is totally <BR>automated. This
    allows us to bring you fonts quickly and <BR>efficently, without raising our prices.<!-/quote-!><hr
    size=0></blockquote> <BR> <BR> <BR>this site is embarassing on so many levels...
    <BR>I&#39;ll refrain from commenting further, but yes <BR>I did notice the misuse/misspelling
    on two <BR>key words, &#34;principle&#34; and &#34;violators&#34;... <BR> <BR>hmmm.

  body: Added note. When I sent the fonts I wanted to the shopping cart not only was
    there a $5 discount as stated on font screen, but there was an additional discount.
    It showed that I could get the 4 fonts I needed for $35 instead of $99 at Phils
    or FF. I do all my work at no charge for non-profits so I guess sometimes I do
    need to be a sucker. But if it works, its okay by me. You can call me a sucker
    anytime I save a $ and get a good product. Again, I really appreciate your time

  body: I&#39;m thinking of starting a website called &#39;Under the table fonts dot
    com&#39;. When a designer like Dawn finds a great deal like $35 instead of $99
    for fonts that some type designer has in good faith licensed to some vendor, in
    the belief that he&#39;s going to make some money in royalties, the designer can
    come to &#39;Under the table...&#39; and send a confidential message to the original
    type designer asking if he or she will accept $35 to buy a license under the table
    &#40;confidential and under the table because so as not to undermine the value
    at which the type designer would prefer to be selling his type&#41;. If the type
    designer agrees, he or she gets the full $35, instead of a percentage of a percentage
    of a percentage of a discounted discounted price, and the designer gets the fonts
    with the added joy of putting his or her money in the hands of a type designer,
    with the only caveat that he or she agrees to keep quiet. <BR> <BR>Of course,
    the long term solution, for the type designer at least, <i>is to stop signing
    contracts that allow vendors to cross license and discount prices.</i>

  body: Isn&#39;t it odd that all the fonts they sell seem to be from the Adobe Type
    Library, or fonts that <i>used</i> to be in the ATL, but aren&#39;t any more &#40;i.e.,
    fonts from Berthold such as Formata&#41;? It all seems a bit fishy to me. I mean,
    did they actually negotiate with Adobe and pay them a &#34;large chunk of money&#34;
    for their entire library &#40;as they suggest on their about page&#41; to allow
    them to sell Adobe Garamond or Minion at a discount? It seems rather implausible
    on the face of it.

    they licensed them from either Agfa Monotype or Linotype. <BR> <BR>They would
    have to have a separate deal with Berthold Types Ltd., since &#40;as far as I
    know&#41; neither AMT nor Lino resells those fonts any more. <BR> <BR>I have inquired
    to them where they license our fonts from. It will be interesting to see what

  body: Hi Daniel, <BR> <BR>&#62; How&#39;s the OpenType library coming? <BR> <BR>Well,
    we finished converting our existing type library early in the year &#40;we were
    almost done last year, except for a handful of stragglers&#41;. There are about
    35 fonts we can&#39;t ship in OpenType format because our licensing doesn&#39;t
    allow for it, but the other 2250 or so are all out there. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have
    a presentation at ATypI this weekend that&#39;s a &#34;technology preview&#34;
    of Unicode and OpenType functionality in a future version of Adobe Illustrator.
    <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    for a Mailboxes N More in Everett, WA and the phone # is not a valid phone # &#40;several
    reverse searches on the big guys revealed no such number&#41;. The Sec of State
