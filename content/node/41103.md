    I would probably consider choosing a sans serif and setting the line straight,

  body: "I have to agree with dav. The lettering is very nice, but the tagline would
    indeed look better if you use a sans serif in a straight line, probably aligned
    to the right of the lettering or otherwise next to the B below onkers.\r\n\r\ndav(2)"

  body: "Thanks Stephen. Ignore the email I sent you. Sharon, and the two Davs, Thanks.
    \ I actually did not care for having the tagline. I showed her 6 options. Some
    were as you mentioned. But I must say I sure had fun lettering this :) \r\n\r\n"
