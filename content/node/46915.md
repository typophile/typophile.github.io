    don't recall if they specifically talked about typefaces, though.

    in a tissue to put her fag out as utterly revolting as I did?\r\n\r\n\r\nHmm..
    that's strange - I entered the English colloquial for cigarette; Eff Ay Gee, and
    it was censored!  Ha ha ha - so prudish you Americans!\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: It was a great movie overall. Any designer will enjoy the GUI graphics of
    the watch. And hey, Wreckless Eric was in the soundtrack!

    \ I thought that was indeed disgusting, but I thought it was devilishly clever
    of her as well.  She was playing the part of a reclusive tragedy writer who seemed
    to have no penchant for public display.  I thought the spitting, while putrid,
    was fitting.\r\n\r\nfag...Reminds me of Michael Scott in the American version
    of The Office:  \"I would never have called Oscar faggy had I known he was gay.
    You don't call retarded people \"retards\". That would be in bad taste. You call
    your friends \"retards\" when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar to
    be my friend.\""
