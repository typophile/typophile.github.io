  is used as part of the layout in  a magazine for American Airlines. Probably the
  one onboard the planes. Could anyone else confirm this? Have anyone else seen it
  lately? I would be most eager to lay my hands on a copy. Any further info on this
  is helpful. TIA. ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers"

    Airline have a magazine called NEXOS, which is the onboard magazine for all their
    Spanish speaking destinations (mainly Latin America and Central America). Coes
    out six times a year, in about 236.000 copies each time... so it can't be to bad
    to have Sophisto featured could it?! :-)\r\n\r\nhttp://nexosmag.com/Default.aspx?tabid=193\r\n\r\nAny
    additional info could come handy though, TIA."
