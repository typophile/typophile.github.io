body: "Hey all!\r\nIm looking for the font from the attached picture. Sadly my predecessor
  deleted the original .ai file so either I find the font and edit it, or I have to
  redraw the whole thing. Yeah, the font is not very compicated, would be easy to
  redraw the logo, but later on the client might need the same font for who-knows-what,
  so its better if I can figure out what is its name...\r\nHelp is very much appriciated!\r\nCheers!"
