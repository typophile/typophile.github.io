body: "Hello all!\r\nDue to the logo being printed on numerous things, all from a
  jpg from a screenprinting company that our athletic department once had make (and
  did give us usage consent), I am trying to recreate it.  I am using illustrator
  to make a new vector layer over the actual emblem, but the font is throwing me.
  \ Instead of trying to trace the font, I'd rather just type it in again.\r\n\r\nThe
  E has a little swish up that I cannot seem to find.  Any help would be appreciated!"

    It's part sans, part serif, and part calligraphic. Glad to help out.\r\n\r\n-
