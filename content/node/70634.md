  in the word \"HALLOWEEN\" point to an older alternate set, as all those characters
  are unique.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if there is a digital version available anyplace
  that features these characters?\r\nthanks in advance\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/halloween_3903.gif]"

  body: Although it looks a lot like Serif Gothic, I think it was probably custom,
    at least for the "HALLOWEEN" part. The weight is somewhere between Serif Gothic
    Heavy and Serif Gothic Black, and the serifs are larger.

  body: Yes, although it didn't have a "W" like that. I suspect what they did was
    start with Serif Gothic Heavy, clipped off the center stroke on the alternate
    "W", made it bolder (using an optical effect, analogous to adding a stroke to
    a digital font), and touched up the serifs to make them more pronounced.

  body: Here is a related Post about the very cool alternates for Serif Gothic. http://www.typophile.com/node/1745
    I was just wondering if in fact someone has built the font for the alternates
    yet, but it sounds like not to this point in time, bummmmmer.

  body: ITC (now part of Monotype) has re-released some of its classics with the alternate
    characters restored, but not Serif Gothic yet.

    list?

  body: "The W might have been made from flipping the M and spreading the arms. The
    rounded E can be made using the C. The N is another matter. I also notice that
    the font <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/liberty/\">Liberty</a> has
    some of these features already, but would need bolding with added stroke. In many
    ways Liberty's letters are  closer shapes than Serif Gothic for the HALLOWEEN
    lettering, but JOHN CARPENTER does look like Serif Gothic, with that R.Another
    possible alternative: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/xavier/\">Xavier
    Serif Black</a>, with some serif tweaking (at least for the letters except E).\r\n\r\n-

  body: I thought of those, too, Mike, but I still think it's most likely that it
    was based on Serif Gothic one way or another.
