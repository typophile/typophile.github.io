  body: Whatever font it is, it&#39;s a mess. The stroke widths and serifs are all
    over the map. It looks like someone cut and pasted a bunch of different weights,
    condensed some, bolded others. I like the 1973 series much better.

  body: Are you serious? They don&#39;t use typefaces on stamped license plates &#40;I
    mean for the actual license number&#41;, though they do sometimes resemble existing
    typefaces. In my opinion, the two at the bottom most closely resemble Caslon.

  body: Maybe he&#39;s talking about the face that &#34;VIRGINIA&#34; is set in, which
    I think is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/caxton/bold/testdrive.html?s=VIRGINIA&amp;p=48">Caxton
    Bold</a>, though it&#39;s hard to be sure at such a small size.

  body: Sorry, Mark.  I frequently use &#34;font&#34; and &#34;typeface&#34; interchangeably.

  body: What I meant was that they don&#39;t use what we would call fonts or typefaces
    on stamped license plates. They use special dies of letters and numbers created
    for making license plates. I guess you could call them typefaces in a certain
    sense, but usually a typeface means something you can buy from a font foundry
    for setting type. License plate dies are similar to type in that they involve
    letters and numbers and have a modular way of arranging them to make words or
    numbers, but they have a separate parallel history from type, and they are not
    the same thing.  <BR> <BR>A better way to ask would be, what fonts look like the
    letters and numbers used on these license plates?
