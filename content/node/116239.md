body: Hi, all. Long time lurker, first-time poster. I'm working on a font project
  that includes an integrated set of Hebrew characters (actually, the project started
  out as a Hebrew font that grew to include a harmonious Latin script). Recently,
  the Hebrew characters (including the Shequel, but none of the other currency symbols)
  began "falling back" to TNR or some other default font, but only on Microsoft applications,
  including Word and Character Map. Other, non-Microsoft applications display the
  Hebrew characters correctly. I've done nothing to the OpenType script or any of
  the other "under the hood" stuff; I've just been drawing contours, adjusting bearings,
  etc. as I have been all along. Any idea what's triggering this?
