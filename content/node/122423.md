  Chinese character \"Ren\" which means man/people. It was amazing!\r\nI was stunned
  by it because i think it's rare for western logo / designer using chinese character
  as the inspiration or element. Please anyone who knows some references about this
  kind of logo(type), would you like to tell me?\r\n\r\nP.S: anyone guess know the
  logo i had viewed on Behance? Bacause i have an all night seaching on Behance and
  i can'f found it again because i forgot anything but the logo looks like (see bellow)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ren_5598.jpg]"
