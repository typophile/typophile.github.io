  photoblog. There isn't really much in the way of text, but what there is I've tried
  to make structured and pleasing to the eye, in order to complement the photos.\r\n\r\nHave
  I succeeded? The logo in particular is pretty lacklustre I know, but I'm not really
  a designer, I'm much more into the backend of web design. Help is appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/disc_scr_6713.jpg]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.discretised.com]]"

    The rainbow top and logo doesn't add much, though. You might want to consider
    adding a bit of \"letter-spacing\" to the images titles (\"4 \u2013 Potsdam market
    square\")!"

    darkened it just a shade. I have to admit that the header and footer were sort
    of last minute; I guess I just sot of ran out of ideas. Perhaps back to the drawing
    board.'

  body: '@pennANDink: I deliberately went for large text, since I knew I wanted to
    have large images. I don''t want to have a `click-to-enlarge'' behaviour. I guess
    it might depend on the screen resolution that you view the site with, but I personally
    like that this is a photoblog, and the photos are really the main element, not
    some thumbnail that you can barely see and have to zoom in on.'

  body: "1. This is a [[http://www.alistapart.com/articles/settingtypeontheweb/|minor
    suggestion]] and just a matter of personal taste, but I'd love to see \"This is
    the corner of...\" aligned with \"Canon EOS 450D.\"\r\n\r\n2. Why is the header
    and footer narrower than the content width? :D\r\n\r\n3. You could provide an
    alternate layout switcher for visitors with lower screen sizes/resolutions. Or
    even better, auto-detect their screen widths. Setting the &lt;img> dimension using
    CSS."

  body: "Wow, great article, and thanks to CSS, it took only 30 minutes or so to get
    everything looking better! The description text and the metadata table now line
    up properly, but if I make the table rows the same height as the line-height,
    they look a bit crowded, so I had to open them out a little bit.\r\n\r\nActually,
    going back to what penn said: it there a practical reason why one shouldn't use
    large text and images? I'd like to know more about what the disadvantages are.
    I loosely based the format of the site on the boston.com link at the bottom of
    the page. Do the large images also not work there?"

    or mathematically?\r\n\r\nEDIT: oh wait, do you mean why are the header and footer
    <em>wider</em> than the content? Possibly because I make poor design decisions?
    I'm going to see how it looks with the header and footer the same width as the
    content."

  body: "I guess I can understand the desire to have large images for a photoblog,
    but I still don't get the large text. It makes everything seem like a headline
    and therefore loses hierarchy of importance. It also will help most people viewing
    your page who don't have giant widescreen flat panel graphics displays. It's better
    to let your pictures speak for themselves rather than make them do battle with
    the text around them.\r\n\r\n*edit* Having the pictures this big also forces people
    to do a ton of scrolling. I think that even if it isn't the main page, there should
    be a link to an index page that allows you to look over the entire collection
    on one page. I think you'll find that once you get enough pictures on there, it'll
    be a pain to have to find certain ones through clicking to certain dates then
    scrolling.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "I sought out a 1024x768 format screen to view the site on, and have to say
    that things did indeed look mightily large when compared to my 24&quot; screen
    at home. I decided to take up mk2 suggestion of having two layouts controlled
    with CSS that the user can choose between. Here is the new reduced-size version
    of the site.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/disc_scr_2_5537.jpg]\r\nEDIT**
    Hmm, I seem to be having some problem with uploading the image. Sorry to followers
    of the thread... **EDIT\r\n\r\n[[http://www.discretised.com]]\r\n\r\nOne can toggle
    the two layouts using the link in the top-right (this will probably be changed
    to something nicer). I also added a small thumbnail viewer to the top of each
    post so that one can quickly jump to photos as penn recommended. This also shows
    up on the archive pages.\r\n\r\nThere's still a bit more to be done, but I'd appreciate
    any new feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the helpful comments!"
