All the systems ran Quark 4.1, and in my case it was not a Quark problem, because I got the same result with other programs and because Quark could handle the font properly on the older system. The problem was with an Adobe font (and just one weight and style) and I ended up having to replace it with the new open type version. Hope you have better luck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The issue with font format support primarily has OS vendors, not application vendors, calling the shots. I can't tell you how long Type 1 fonts will be viable, because (even if I knew) I can't say when Apple and/or Microsoft might choose to drop support for them. I just think it's worth keeping in mind that neither company has much affection for Type 1. <BR> <BR>Beyond that, Gerald's nasty insinuations seem almost contradictory at times. Apparently problems creating PDFs from QuarkXPress 4.1 are some sort of deliberate Adobe plot against its opposition, while similar problems with PageMaker are incompetence? <BR> <BR>Beyond that, I'm not going to dignify Gerald's comments with responses. I expect they are based in reality in the sense that they doubtless stem from actual problems people have had (though never described by Gerald in enough detail to allow an answer), but his insinuations about them being deliberate plans by Adobe are unfounded paranoia. <BR> <BR>If somebody has a specific problem, and wants to talk about it and see if it can be resolved, I'm happy to go there. Maybe they can get the folks who just want to rant to go start another thread. <BR> <BR>Sigh. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Heh. <BR> <BR>I meant a problem with making something work that involves font technology, such as the two messages that started this thread&ndash;not just another complaint. <BR> <BR>One could just as easily ask, why are so many people still using Illustrator 8? One rather suspects that they found it did all the things they needed, and that the new features were not sufficiently compelling. Perhaps many of them are running older hardware or OSes as well; upgrading would mean upgrading everything, and that gets expensive. Like Gerald, they have the attitude that &quot;it ain't broke, so why fix it?&quot; <BR> <BR>Generally, at some point the incremental advantages of the newest version will get large enough to entice these folks.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Speaking of ranting, threatening Nick and what not with lawsuits. <BR> <BR>That is a lie&ndash;although as usual you have made your accusation harder to rebut by making it as vague as possible (&quot;and what not&quot;). <BR> <BR>The other quote you keep on citing was written by some random writer. Not me, nor by anyone directly associated with OpenType or with a good understanding of it. Should I hold Quark responsible for your statements about what QuarkXPress is capable of? <BR> <BR>As for Tom's problem, I asked some questions, which have not yet been answered. I'll probably ask more questions. That's how one troubleshoots things. Your random rants have not aided him one bit. <BR> <BR>&gt; I thought Quark could not handle &quot;Open Type Fonts&quot;. What's that about? Lots of secrets going on. <BR> <BR>So secret that they are clearly explained in the OpenType User Guide. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype">http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype</a></a> , link on the right. Basically almost all applications work with OpenType fonts, it's just a question of whether they support Unicode, and whether they support the added typographic functionality of OpenType. <BR> <BR>&gt; Furthermore the &quot;big gains&quot; in Open Type&quot; are illusionary see original sales pitch.  <BR> <BR>See my previous comment. <BR> <BR>The big gains in OpenType are the option of  extended language support (compared to Type 1, anyway), cross-platform single-file fonts, and advanced typographic features. <BR> <BR>You don't have to care about any of these, and that's fine. However, all the large type foundries, most of the medium sized ones and many of the small ones are actively developing OpenType fonts. <BR> <BR>Moreover, whatever Tom's problem is, it certainly has nothing to do with &quot;conflicting font formats.' <BR> <BR>In fact, &quot;conflicting font formats&quot; has NEVER been a problem outside of Apple's short-lived GX universe. GX aside, formats per se don't have conflicts. Font NAMES may conflict and cause big problems, but that's independent of format. <BR> <BR>Later, <BR> <BR>T</div>

I recently ran my fonts through font doctor. Gerald, your fonts had errors just like any other foundries. But, perhaps Font Doctor makes mountains out of molehills. <BR> <BR>Opentype is a wonderful thing. However, I still use PS1 fonts because I still use Quark &hellip; and I also think Suitcase has trouble when I activate too many Opentype at once.

I can see that optical scaling could be a feature of opentype, but what does optical scaling have to do with someone having problems with a typeface?! I can see that optical scaling is a good feature. Any typographer would appreciate that. I licensed ITC Bodoni because it is available in different optical sizes. But why piss on (excuse my unlady-like term) on opentype? If a foundry chooses not to do PS1 anymore that is their choice. Yes, past customers will have problems with this choice. Yes, perhaps Adobe will hit a snag. But, why piss on the technology? If you don't wish to make opentype that is ok too. I don't license type by the format I license type by how it looks and is it something I need for a job &hellip; and then I question format. If it is a job in Quark (etc) then obviously I can't license Opentype, but that is the only program I use with the problem. <BR> <BR>Kudos for having offered optical scaling. But not every job needs optically scaled type. <BR> <BR>Kudos for being so stalwart toward PS1. <BR> <BR>But the time and energy you are putting into attempting to get people to boycott opentype could be spent in creating more type.</div>

Sorry, my mistake, I should have made myself more clear. <BR> <BR>Look, I don't think you know what optical scaling is about. Never having had it you simply don't know what you are missing. <BR> <BR>I just love cliches. <BR> <BR>Optical scaling is very important. I am not sure if you followed, but I am not the only one interested. <BR> <BR>I am sure you remember &quot;Ink Traps&quot;. <BR> <BR>Some of the most typographically tuned contributors have had lengthy discussions about it. Names, Kent Lew, John Hudson, Gerald Lange and my good friend Hrant. In fact Hrant and I do not agree on much. Optical scaling is one of them. <BR> <BR>Forget optical sizes in type. That is strictly boutique font material. For instance &quot;Founders Caslon&quot;. <BR> <BR>Optical sizes can arrive at the same look, I agree. But it is not the same solution. So this is just a smoke screen. <BR> <BR>Optical scaling is just what it says, scaling-on-the-fly, you pick a point size in the menu. It is the same font, not some separate pick. Font menus are confusing enough. <BR> <BR>Think of it this way. If you were going to insist as Hrant does that points are too crude and fonts should be in fraction of points your mouse will have to go down through a hole in your floor to pick your point size. For that matter what if you pick the wrong font for the point size? Are you suggesting it would be elegant to eliminate scaled fonts altogether. <BR> <BR>You like bitmaps? That's all you would need. <BR> <BR>So what do you see as elegant. <BR> <BR>Thomas told me in the Open Type Forum, that optical scaling would never, ever be part of the Open Type Format. So what is your take on that. <BR> <BR>Before you answer I want to remind you of something you said about Albertan by Jim Rimmer. You said it was tooooo sparkly at small point sizes. Well if you say that you have already move well beyond agreement that optical scaling is important. So please do not decide against agreeing with me, just because it is me.  <BR> <BR>Anyway if you do, I obviously have nothing to teach you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eesh. I'm kind of sorry I spoke up. My problem was with univers 45 italic, in which the right side of the W was cut off in recent versions of Windows (XP and 2000). I suppose it was some issue with the inf or pfm file (which came straight off the font folio CD) relative to the newer versions of Windows. <BR> <BR>But I'm not blaming Adobe because when the font was created XP and 2000 didn't exist, and I don't see how they can be held responsible for all its vagaries. Nor was the problem with Quark, because the font also didn't display correctly in ATM. (My thread about the problem was called something like &quot;univers font problem,&quot; but no one had any thoughts to offer.) <BR> <BR>It was frustrating but I think it's more of a Windows problem than anything. If I had stayed at Windows 98 I would have been fine. <BR> <BR>Just hope it doesn't start happening with all my fonts &hellip; or shouldn't I mention that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tom: <BR> <BR>Right, I remember that problem now. <BR> <BR>I have been giving it some thought, and I suspect it is a problem with Windows GDI using the ATM driver that is built into Windows (2000 and later), when dealing with synthetic obliques. My guess is that GDI isn't realizing that it has to allow for the fact that the fontmatrix has been slanted, changing the effective bounding box of the glyph, when it decides how much space to reserve for drawing the pixels onscreen. <BR> <BR>So, by this theory, it would be a Windows bug. <BR> <BR>Some readers may wonder what the heck a synthetic oblique and a fontmatrix are. If you want the full technical explanation of the gobbledygook, keep reading&hellip;. <BR> <BR>Type 1 fonts were originally developed to be built into output devices back in the early to mid 80s, when printer memory (ROM or even RAM) to store fonts was in short supply. So Adobe came up with the notion of having &quot;synthetic&quot; fonts that were just transformations of an initial font, and could refer to the original font and take up hardly any space. This was mostly used for oblique versions of some sans serifs, although it's also responsible for the horrid Helvetica Narrow, which was just regular Helvetica mathematically condensed by 18% (if memory serves). The &quot;transformation matrix&quot; is the bit of a Type 1 font that specifies any slanting or scaling of the outlines. It's in the header portion of the font, so it's plain text if you crack it open in a word processor or hex editor. <BR> <BR>So, why does this matter for fonts on your computer instead of in a PostScript printer? Well, when making the computer-based version of the font, it was done the same way, except that the base font would be replicated, as well as having the transformation matrix applied. So the outlines for Univers Oblique in Type 1 are actually identical to the outlines for plain old Univers; the only difference is that transformation matrix specifying the slant. <BR> <BR>Thus the theory that maybe Windows wasn't being quite smart enough to take that into account. It probably only affects cases where the transformation matrix is sufficient to stick something out past the end of the advance width of the glyph, mostly glyphs that are rendering right near the top right&hellip; like the cap W. <BR> <BR>PostScript flavored OpenType fonts also support this same stuff. But when converting the Adobe Type Library to OpenType, besides the big stuff, we did a lot of minor improvements to how the fonts were built. One of them was to eliminate the synthetic font transformations using the fontmatrix, and instead change the actual font outlines. <BR> <BR>So, if the Type 1 font has the problem, and the OpenType doesn't, well, given everything else, that sure seems like the probably culprit. It would be possible to fix the problem on the Windows side by fixing their bug, or by rebuilding the font to not use the synthetic oblique. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

Maybe that's just the capitalist in me coming out tho&hellip; go ahead and fault me for that. <BR> <BR><i>It is the same font, not some separate pick. Font menus are confusing enough.</i> <BR>If I am correct on this&hellip; originally in the days of metal type each point size was a separate font, right? I don't see why we should complain about scrolling down a simple menu (don't know what's so confusing about that) rather than lugging out a big case of lead just to change the point size. Personaly, I'd rather switch fonts for size than when i want small caps or OSF or alternates or expert ligatures, etc. etc.  <BR> <BR>I think OpenType is pretty cool, and I avoid using Quark whenever I don't have to.

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, please provide a direct quote to back up your latest lie: <BR> <BR>&quot;Thomas told me in the Open Type (sic) Forum, that optical scaling would never, ever be part of the Open Type (sic) Format. So what is your take on that.&quot; <BR> <BR>To the best of my recollection, and based on my reviewing of my posts in that forum going back to July of 2000, I do not believe I ever said any such thing. Do you have an actual message that I wrote, which you interpret as saying such a thing? If so, please provide it. <BR> <BR>In any case, optical sizes, as discrete designs for specific point size ranges, are already part of OpenType. The framework was specifically designed to allow the fonts to be automatically selected without showing individual size-specific fonts in the font menu. Apps have not yet supported this mechanism, but the infrastructure is part of OpenType, and has been for years. <BR>See &lt;<a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/appendices/features_pt.jsp#size" target="_blank"><a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/appendices/features_pt.jsp#size">http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/appendices/features_pt.jsp#size</a></a>&gt;. <BR> <BR>This has been pointed out to you before, Gerald. Yet you continue to make misleading statements about what is and is not possible in OpenType. I'm sorry you don't like the newer technology, yet I am not disturbed by your irrational prognostications. It's the demonstrably false claims and absurd innuendoes that bother me. <BR> <BR>It is true that continuous optical scaling, as was possible with MMs and some proprietary implementations in Type 3, is not feasible in OpenType as OpenType does not support axis-based fonts. Some folks have claimed that one could accomplish it with TrueType hinting, but I believe that is so impractical as to be virtually impossible. <BR> <BR>Even in this latter area, I do not recall ever saying that axis based technology would &quot;never, ever&quot; be part of the OpenType format. In fact, I would not be totally shocked if some day in the distant future some sort of axis based technology returned to OpenType. I just won't hold my breath, as it certainly won't be any time soon. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of course I understand. You can't provide evidence to support your claim, so you'll resort to other kinds of attacks to divert attention from the falsehood. It's often an effective tactic. <BR> <BR>I will admit that my frustration level grows when people make absurd, false claims. Even more so when they make apparently false claims about things I have said. I had actually gone and edited my message prior to posting it to try to remove the more inflammatory comments, but unfortunately I missed the word &quot;lie&quot; in the opening line. It was excessive. I can imagine that I may have at some point said something which you could have misinterpreted to mean what you claim I said. That's why I'd like to see what it is I wrote that you think supports the claim. I took the time to do my homework to try to find a statement that could have been interpreted that way, somehow, and found nothing that I posted in the last four years (which is as far back as my email archive goes, unfortunately). <BR> <BR>I did find a statement from Paul Nelson of Microsoft saying something to the effect that Multiple Masters were dead in OpenType and weren't coming back. Perhaps that's what you were thinking of? However, please note that I am not Paul Nelson. <BR> <BR>As for my job security, I am not overly worried. About the worst thing that I could see happening is that I might get told to quit hanging out and posting so much in public forums. That would give me more time for real work, and would not be such a great loss for me. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, every time I call you on one of your false statements, you change the subject. Nice try, but it doesn't wash. <BR> <BR>As for my comment on competition in the type industry, I was simply saying that nobody has ever made a statement like the famous one attributed to Microsoft about Netscape. If you were unfamiliar with it, do a Google search for &quot;microsoft netscape air supply&quot; and see what comes up. <BR> <BR>You keep on trying to read between the lines of my statements to find some innuendo in my comments to Nick. The thing is, I meant exactly what I said, no more and no less. Anybody who knows me well can tell you that. It's folks like you who argue with insinuation and implications, but that's not my style. <BR> <BR>So, let's see, according to you, it's not okay to actually call you out on things you say that aren't true, and of course it wouldn't be okay to sue you for libel, either. So I guess the virtuous path is to just let you say false things and not contradict them? <BR> <BR>Nope. If you claim I said something that I never said, and the statement you are wrongfully attributing to me is in fact the opposite of what I have said and believe, then I am going to call you out on it. <BR> <BR>One last time, for the record, I do NOT think and have never suggested that any font-bundling application vendor should sue Nick for libel&ndash;but I was concerned that he might have opened himself up to such activity. I also have NEVER WRITTEN that &quot;optical scaling would never, ever be part of the OpenType format.&quot; <BR> <BR>Then there are all the untrue statements you've made about OpenType itself, but those were already dealt with. So I'll shut up now, until/unless you say something else that is blatantly false about things I've said or have worked on. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul Nelson is a Microsoft employee, not an Adobe employee and certainly not an Adobe spokesperson. I am not, and have never been, Paul Nelson. Is that clear enough? <BR> <BR>Although I may have more hope that something like MM might return some day, in the really long-term prospects, there is not much space between Paul's views and mine on MMs in OpenType. It's dead for now, and it's certainly not returning any time soon. <BR> <BR>However, multiple masters or any axis-based solution are not the only way to achieve optical scaling, though they are certainly the most elegant. I have already pointed you to the information on how it's done in OpenType. Typically a foundry will make some lesser number of discrete optical sizes. Adobe generally does four. Each is intended to cover a range of sizes. (for examples see <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/topics/opticalsize.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/topics/opticalsize.html">http://store.adobe.com/type/topics/opticalsize.html</a></a>) <BR> <BR>Note that just because the optically sized faces are packaged as separate fonts does not mean they have to be designed separately. Adobe uses MM technology in designing many of its typefaces today, including virtually all of those with optical size variants (although our upcoming Garamond revival has separately designed optical sizes, it's a special case). <BR> <BR>Meanwhile, yes, you are wrong about the size of OpenType fonts. Is there some reason you can't read Adobe's OpenType User Guide, which I have pointed you at repeatedly? It's not that long, and written in plain English. Or my article on font formats, which is slightly more technical, but not too unreadable. Current version can be found here: <a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/Typography/1092" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/Typography/1092">http://www.adobeforums.com/Typography/1092</a></a> <BR> <BR>Anyway, with regard to OpenType font size, I have about 2500 fonts in my main fonts folder, including the entire Adobe Type Library in OpenType, which is most of that. The folder also has various supplemental files (PDFs, source files for some fonts, whatnot). The entire size of the folder is 550 MB. <BR> <BR>OpenType fonts with PostScript outlines are generally considerably smaller than equivalent Type 1 fonts. They don't usually have the bitmaps at all, for starters (like Windows Type 1 fonts in this regard). CFF is simply more compact than Type 1, plus you can have subroutines to reduce the size even further. Compared to Windows Type 1 (which is smaller than Mac Type 1), one knocks off about 45% of the size. <BR> <BR>Of course, depending on the size of the glyph set in the font and the extent of OpenType layout goodies involved, that can add a fair bit back. <BR> <BR>A typical OpenType font from the Adobe library that was converted with no merged fonts and only minimal added extras is 28-45K, with 30-35K being most common. <BR> <BR>A Pro font that adds CE language support but no extra typographic goodies might average 50-60K. A Pro font with CE support that also merges lots of typographic stuff averages around 100-150K. If it has really extensive language support as well (say Greek and Cyrillic, as well as Latin+CE), it might be in the 160-220K range. But it's not like your whole library will magically sprout CE, Greek and Cyrillic support. People still have to design this stuff. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald &amp; Gerald, was everything really Vne at your printing oWce a decade ago? Type 1 was an incredibly limited format even for English typography, let alone any of the world's more complex scripts. But everything is supposed to stand still because a couple of guys who would by happy to set all type by hand or on a Monotype caster thought messing around with expert sets to get their V, W, X, Y, and Z ligatures was Vne? A decade ago it didn't matter that the font format was limited to 8-bits, because so was most text processing and page layout software unless you happened to be Asian. But the idea that a font format limited to 8-bits has any future, or even much of a present, in 16- and 32-bit text environments it just laughable. You might also have noticed that a rather large percentage of the text you read every day is not beautifully printed on nice creamy paper: <i>it's here on this screen.</i> Something like OpenType happens to be <i>necessary</i> for the majority of people in the world to be able to read their own languages, particularly in electronic media in which, unlike print, the text remains live and the publisher has little or no control over eventual display. It happens that the companies that developed OpenType to meet this need also saw a use for it in making it easier to apply Vne typographic features, but typographers shouldn't be so parochial as to think this technology is all about them, or that just because they might have been satisVed with Type 1 &ndash; and I certainly wasn't satisiVed with it and wish it a speedy death &ndash; this has any bearing on the ability of billions of people to read their own languages in their own writing systems.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, <BR> <BR>Almost 40 years ago I went to sea on Greek ships. Livanos, a tramp steamship line. <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/GiampaIntroduction.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://lanstontype.com/GiampaIntroduction.html">http://lanstontype.com/GiampaIntroduction.html</a></a> <BR>I still get mail from Greece. My family get phone calls when I have gone missing in action. I learned about Greek foods aboard the ships. Let's just say I know what I like. I can still Greek dance, not so good at smashing glasses at the end of the night. I quit drinking several years back. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately I never cooked until later in life. I have published my Saganaki recipe on the web. Lower right hand column. <BR> <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/Saganaki.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://lanstontype.com/Saganaki.html">http://lanstontype.com/Saganaki.html</a></a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, <BR>Surely you are joking? You must know what John means. 8, 16, 32 bits are the amount of information addressable by the computer.  With each step up, the amount of information addressable increases by a huge amount.  The first step is from 256 to 16,000,000.  This means a font can contain not only enough information for the small Latin set of characters and so-called expert sets but for every known language including Kangi. It also can do a better job of kerning and smart replacement of glyphs giving type designers options they never had before.  Surely you can see the value in this?   <BR>Every new technology comes in with bumps and bruises which take a while to repair.  Remember when movable type came in?  It pissed off a buch of caligraphers who had perfected the art of writing far better than any printing press at the time could come close to.  Now measure how much your own company's metal types have improved upon typesetting since then.  The hard part is for us old geezers. We have done the heavy lifting through earlier &quot;new&quot; technologies and remember the sigh of satisfaction of seeing improvement. To now see it all starting again and perhaps realizing that we don't have the energy of our youth and fear the task ahead may outlive us.  Fear not, the young bit&amp;byte mongers of this day will have their chance to finish the job and later lament the next wave of new technology to decend on them. <BR>Gerald, keep making the beautiful type you are making and let the young tech jockeys of today ready it for the next &quot;new&quot; thing.  It is like turning your drawings over to a punch cutter, you get to challenge them and speak your mind but they have to do the dirty work of cutting steel. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>
