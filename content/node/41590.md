body: "I'm looking for suggestions for a body copy typeface that saves space but doesn't
  seem condensed, similar to Times New Roman, but not Times New Roman. \r\n\r\nEfficiency
  and legibility over long, dense content is paramount followed by versatility and
  lastly a feminine quality (not overly important).\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Use <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1345/plantin-family.html\" target=\"blank\">Plantin</a>,
    Times New Roman is based on Plantin and I think Plantin's italics and caps are
    a bit feminine. It's being used by Monocle magazine.\r\n\r\nYou can also try <a
    href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-27-lido-stf\" target=\"blank\">Lido</a>,
    Frantisek Storm's try at TNR. And it's free.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: How about <a href="http://www.garagefonts.com/typespecimens.html?key=bannerfam&thename=Freight&link=T&formsubmit=T">Freight
    Text</a>? It's a great face, and its space efficiency is almost exactly the same
    as that of Times New Roman.
