  medium and light versions of a typeface and also what are the differences between
  the versions, besides the fact that they look different.

  body: "Hey froot, there are lots of motivations for picking a style for it's weight.
    The color on the page is one likely motive where the design, designer and/or production
    methods demand one over the other. Another motive is to get an appropriate contrast
    between the lighter and the bolder at the same size. And this same quest for contrast
    is often pursued in the relationship between text and headlines, different kinds
    of text, and betweeen headline faces.\r\n\r\nThere is no hard rule on which to
    select, but when a single \"regular\" is all that is available, one must hope
    that it's color beside the bold, or in relation to other fonts in a particular
    design or production process, is \"just right\".\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Those terms are now used as weights, except in this context \"Roman\" isn't
    quite right, and should be \"Regular\".\r\n\"Roman\" is the style default for
    a typeface family, in opposition to Italic, whereas Regular is the weight default
    -- so you can see how the default font Regular Roman may become abbreviated to
    either Regular or Roman (which are, strictly speaking, incorrect), ignoring the
    possibility that what's being described might be Bold or Italic. But in practice
    Regular (or nothing), not Roman, is used to denote the default of a typeface:
    regular weight, roman style.\r\n\r\nThe weight designations are actually given
    numbers and positions in some software schemes -- Thomas Phinney posted a link
    to a file which shows a chart of this, in the Build section of Typophile, some
    time ago. Anyway, AFAIK, certain software applications recognize a scale of weights,
    and this is included in FontLab, so that when type designers such as myself are
    making fonts, we follow the scale which includes:\r\n300 Light\r\n400 Regular\r\n400
    Book\r\n500 Medium\r\n600 DemiBold\r\n600 SemiBold\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there
    is some confusion there -- quite understandably, as \"book\" is not really an
    adjective and doesn't describe weight in the way the others do.\r\n\r\n\"Book\"
    has occasionally proved to be a useful typographic term, although these days it
    can cause problems if both Book and Regular weights are included in a font family.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThe
    first instance of a type family member named Book that I came across was Bodoni
    Book, and this would be at least 25 years ago. It was a regular weight Bodoni,
    but with slightly heavier hairlines than Bodoni Regular from the same foundry.
    Presumably they named it Book because they needed a word to let people know it
    was different from Regular, but not a different weight, despite its extra heft.
    Anyway, the memorably alliterated Bodoni Book proved to be a very durable general
    purpose font, without some of the problems that the fine hairlines of Bodoni Regular
    would cause when photographically processed during production. \r\n\r\nIt also
    had a classy tone, as it sounds upscale to be using a \"book\" font in a mere
    pamphlet or brochure.\r\n"

  body: "Nick -- Bodoni Book is actually the name given to one of the Bodoni series
    in the 1923 ATF catalog. It is actually a lighter weight than the undesignated
    Bodoni cut (which is the typically heavy weight of this style at that time).\r\n\r\n--

  body: "Book was used much more often in the metal type era. I don't think it was
    applied with a given strict standard accross foundries. This is pure speculation
    but it seemed to be that it was more a designation that could combine anything
    from fit to weight. Perhaps since books tended to be  printed at higher quality
    than newspaper or simple jobbing work, the refinements in \"Book\" weight would
    come through best under good printing conditions.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: Hi

  body: "Typically \"book\" means that the contrast is lowered compared to the regular
    weight. A lot of digital type came from the original display masters, etc., thereby
    making a beautiful typeface less usable in a long running text.\r\n\r\nBembo is
    a classic example. A beautiful typeface, but something was missing when you used
    it for text.\r\n\r\nEnter Bembo Book, a slightly heftier, less contrasty typeface
    much more suitable for setting text.\r\n\r\nYou see the same thing when you peer
    into the optical sizing of the Adobe fonts."
