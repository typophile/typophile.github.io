body: "I've decided upon the classic Minion Pro for my PhD thesis (human geography
  / cultural studies).\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that Minion Pro is a pain to read
  on screen at 11pt\r\n(I'm writing the thesis using OpenOffice, but it's the same
  in MS Word or Acrobat Professional and even the windows font preview)\r\nAlignments
  and spacings are really off (the dots on the i appear between the letters, the first
  arc of the m is half the width of the second and the r huddles up against the next
  character, and so on...)\r\n\r\nI can, of course, use a different font for writing
  (I'm currently using DejaVu for screen readability) but I'm required to submit both
  a paper and electronic copy of the thesis. (And I imagine my examiners may be reading
  the electronic version)\r\n\r\nIs my experience of Minion Pro & screen reading a
  common problem, or is something wrong with my screen / font setup?\r\n\r\nIf it
  is a common problem, is there a decent screen-readable Minion version available?
  Or any suggestions for a similar font which is readable on-screen?\r\n\r\n(I'm loathe
  to use completely different typefaces for both versions of the thesis, because of
  the extra editing that will inevitably entail...)"

    about making it look nice after the writing is done.

  body: ">I'm not sure a PhD thesis is ever 'done'. \r\n\r\nYou seem alarmingly unclear
    on the PhD concept. You need, in collaboration with your supervisors, to get a
    clear idea of \"done.\" The font is the least of your worries. Finish the thesis,
    then worry about the font. \r\n\r\nOn screen, say with a PDF, people can always
    zoom in on the text. "

    This can be stimulating or motivating.\r\n\r\nBut that Minion Pro is looking as
    you describe seems odd."

    Thanks for the concern, but it is all in hand and at a fairly advanced stage. '

    As I say, if this is in a PDF zoom will probably solve the problem. Personally
    I write everything in [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|Williams
    Caslon Text]], as you might suspect :) '

    Minion does that in Word. Don't know about other software."

    of the m I think would be hinting problems, which surprises me on an Abobe font.
    You need one of the screen rendering mavens here to tell you more. \r\n\r\nIs
    this from Windows? If you and those who evaluate you are working on Windows, you
    might try John Hudson's Constantia, as this is more literary in look and should
    render well on screen. It is one of the relatively new \"C\" fonts that comes
    with Word.  "

  body: Does your Minion Pro also look so terrible in Adobe Reader? I think they have
    a different render. And I don't believe they have a reason to render their own
    fonts in a bad way.....

  body: "My thesis will also turn up in Minion, eventually. The rendering of Adobe
    fonts in Windows is generally terrible; it's not just you. It seems more unusual,
    though, that it's also happening in Adobe Reader. You're not, perhaps, using Microsoft's
    PDF exporter for Word, are you? It will export the page as an image rather than
    type, with generally disastrous results.\r\n\r\nLaTeX still seems to be the cool
    software for writing a thesis, but I really think that it's simply too complicated
    for most people. For better typography, then, my plan is to write the thing in
    Word and import the files into InDesign for final submission. Perhaps this is
    overkill, but I'm somewhat addicted to real small caps."

  body: "CFF rendering on Windows is generally pathetic if applications are relying
    on the system for rendering. If you were to use Adobe's Creative Suite applications,
    I'm sure you would not be seeing the same issues. Also, if the final electronic
    copy will be in PDF format, it is doubtful that you will face the rendering problems
    you are seeing in OpenOffice (depending on what reader application you are using
    and how it handles CFF rendering).\r\n\r\nFor full disclosure I am an Adobe employee.
    However, I have tried to objectively characterize the problem as I see it (even
    if 'pathetic' might seem too emotive)."
