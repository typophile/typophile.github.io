  a sentence on something (pillow, caps, table, tree, cup, paper bag) by using foundation
  hand. And i have about 0 ideas that is easy to perform as well as good looking.
  Any ideas / inspiration links?\r\n\r\nI`ve got http://www.lettermade.com/photos/
  http://typographi.com/\r\n\r\nI`m not asking you to do this for me. Well, that would
  be impossible anyways :)"

  body: Ive got this IKEA lamp thats square at the top, maybe make something to lay
    on top of it that will project letters.. its simple, but perhaps cut out "We only
    come out at night" in plastic and put it on top. I dont know how well it will
    project, but if it blurs, it may also be nice.

  body: "I don\u2019t think a lamp will project without a lens, but you could get
    it to cast a shadow from some type on a piece of acetate, which would probably
    distort, you could experiment with distorting your type to counteract that. Let
    us see how you progress though.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: 'Im thinking that damping the light, isolating the sides and adding the cover
    will give a nice blur, and seeing the top directly would be an answer to this
    assignment. If i get this togheter fast, i would be cool to work with different
    colours and overlays. And solutions for focusing using a lens. '
