  body: Not only can I completely recommend this book, I can also say that I&#39;ve
    used it many times in my own personal bibliographies. It is, by far, one of those
    books that serious typohiles must own. And if you don&#39;t own it, you should
    question your level of seriousness. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Buy it <a href="http://www.typophile.com/books/archives/1%20Type%20Design:%20History.html#000081"

  body: Very good book, but the quality of the reproductions in the new edition leave
    something to be desired when compared with the original.

    something to show-off. '
