body: "Recently I embarked on a project analysing different copies of A Clockwork
  Orange, the novella. Here is a question about book publishing that has started to
  baffle me; which might actually turn out to be quite general knowledge, so here
  goes.\r\n\r\nI purchased an old Penguin copy of which inside reads:\r\n\r\n\"First
  published by William Heinemann Ltd 1962\r\nPublished in Penguin Books 1972\r\n40
  39 38 37 36\"\r\n\r\nIgnoring the fact that I don't know what the last line of descending
  numbers mean, I got the impression that this was a copy from 1972, as was listed
  by the Amazon seller from whom I purchased it. However, on the very first page,
  it references events in Burgess's life in 1975 and 1982. \r\n\r\nAgain the same
  happens when I look at a W. W. Norton copy which says it was published in 1986,
  and is yet able to tell us that Burgess died in 1993. \r\n\r\nI guess what I'm really
  wondering, is whether there's a way to track down the dates of paperback reprints,
  as many non-fiction books will list and date these. \r\n\r\nMany thanks!"

  body: "The numbers at the bottom are reprint numbers.\r\n\r\nSo, your copy is the
    36th printing of the 1972 edition. Obviously, they didn\u2019t go back on press
    35 times in the first year; so your copy was certainly printed much later. \r\n\r\nBut
    if there are no textual changes, then there is usually no change to the publication
    date. The only indication of the new reprint is to scrub another number from the
    plate.\r\n\r\nUsually, a new foreword or introduction to a reprinted edition should
    have a date of its own attached to it, I would think.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to
    find the exact actual printing date of a specific paperback edition, you\u2019d
    probably have to find some business records of the publisher. I doubt this is
    something that anyone except the production director really cares to keep track
    of."

    3 2 1  - the next edition reprint would be the same minus the one etc. - when
    ten editions is reached they would go to 20 19 18 etc. for the next set.

    which printing it is, instead of the more laborious process of composing the page

  body: "I don\u2019t believe the practice existed when books were set in metal and
    printed letterpress. I believe it only came about as the confluence of two things:
    offset lithography and when it became practical to hang on to the plates for future
    reprints.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think it was practical (certainly not common practice)
    to store the galleys for an entire book in metal.\r\n\r\nBut with offset lithography,
    at a certain point it was more cost-effective to store the aluminum plates (or
    at least the photographic page flats) for a book with expected longevity, than
    to reshoot the flats or reburn the plates.\r\n\r\nAt that point, it made sense
    to set a string of reprint numbers, where the only thing required when going to
    reprint would be to either opaque out the previous number (if working with the
    films) or scrub/degrease the number (if working with the plates). Easier than
    remaking the page (or, more likely, the entire form).\r\n\r\nNowadays, the practice
    is probably more a matter of convention than practicality, since plates are no
    longer saved and pages are archived as files (either source, or imposed sigs)
    and it\u2019s a relatively minor matter to make an adjustment to the copyright
    page on the way to re-plating.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know, I suppose maybe there\u2019s
    some minor advantage to being able to just delete the previous number, over resetting
    the line. Seems minor, compared to the origins of the practice anyway.\r\n\r\nCharles
    E will set me straight if I\u2019ve made any incorrect assumptions or misstated
    anything."

  body: If the publisher anticipated demand for reprints, books were often stored
    as stereotype or electrotype plates back before offset litho. But I don't know
    whether reprint numbers were in use yet before the end of hot metal. Can you just
    chisel a number off those plates (or would electrotype plates have had hollow
    backs)?

    metal.</cite>\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been trying to find an example in my collection
    of older books and have not run across any. If there is any reprint information
    at all, it is an expressed date \u2014 e.g.: \u201CThird Printing, August 1966\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe
    earliest example of a reprint number sequence that I\u2019ve found so far in my
    [modest] collection happens to be a Penguin book, from 1967 (printed offset)."

    and Printing. The Penguin book that you have was published in 1972 and your copy

    as the added historical information you mention, error corrections, etc. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "The practice of using reprint edition numbers started when offset printing
    became the principal means of book printing. Only a simple rearrangement in one
    line was needed (remember doing that in film?) to adjust the line. In case of
    a symmetrical placement the numbers were blocked out or scratched of (depending
    on the base being a pos or neg).\r\n\r\n@HVB: In principle there won\u2019t be
    differences between printings \u2014 except the number of the printing. Any changes
    would require it being named a new edition. \r\nMy guess is that the correction
    of a small number of (typographies) errors would not warrant it calling a new
    edition. There would probably be a kind of indication on the full printing forms
    to inform the printer and the publishers, maybe in the fold or in the bleed. Example
    (slightly out of the field): the different printings of the Tintin comic books
    are coded vy the publisher to reflect changes etcetera."

    you wouldn't have had pages stored. More likely it was stereo mats, that could
    be used to cast a new printing cylinder. I wonder if the system was in use then
    ... and if so, how did you cancel out a number on a mat? I like to imagine an
    old printer filling the mat with some chewing gum before casting it ... but really
    I have no clue.\r\n\r\nDon"
