body: "I'm laying out a newletter/magazine, and the client recently asked to remove
  all hyphens from the text (which is  left-justified).\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that
  hyphens improve legibility by leading the eye and allowing for a more even and less
  jumpy rag. I was thinking about my  rationale today and realized I have no proof
  to back up the legibility angle. Was wondering if anyone knows of any studies that
  have been done on the topic or if there is any science (psuedo or otherwise) that
  I could use to defend my preference for hyphenating text. If I can make the case
  for improved legibility I think it will be easier persuade the client. \r\n\r\nThanks,
  eh! \r\n\r\n"

  body: I've had the same problem with some clients who insist on no hyphenation,
    or who nit-pik the hyphenation so much that I end up eliminating it. Drives me
    nuts.

  body: "Obviously, rivers in text are a bad thing.\r\n\r\nSo, back when text was
    fully justified, and columns were narrow (there is a little research, but a lot
    of rules of thumb, on column width), hyphenation made sense.\r\n\r\nNow that computers
    do it, they make mistakes.\r\n\r\nAnd when text is ragged right, do the line widths
    need to be still close, or can the right side be more ragged without harm? I don't
    know of any research on this point."

  body: "Perhaps someone knows of a study, but my guess is that hyphenation is used
    more for a better visual appearance.\r\n\r\nAnd if your client has a preference
    for no hyphenation, a dusty old academic study won't change their mind anyway.
    Your best bet might be to show them examples of popular, well-designed magazines
    that use hyphenation. "

  body: "Thanks for the suggestion. I was thinking the same thing yesterday... showing
    them some nicely design publications which use hyphenation might make them feel
    more comfortable about it. I've got some narrow columns which are especially hard
    to typeset without hyphenation. \r\n\r\n"

    And pretty much every magazine would use hyphenation so you won't need to look
    hard.\r\n\r\nThere is a previous thread http://typophile.com/node/30235 which
    will give you various viewpoints."

  body: "With no hyphenation in ragged text, both pseudo-justi\uFB01cation and great
    disparities of line length will randomly occur in adjacent lines, which is more
    intrusive and disruptive to smooth reading than hyphenation."
