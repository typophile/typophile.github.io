body: I have to go on an internship this (school)year. I was thinking about going
  to London, but amazingly enough I can't seem to find that many. London is known
  for it's high concentration of design firms i believe. I've bought and looked into
  some books, but I was also wondering if anybody on this forum knows some good firms.

    awards]]. \r\nThey do tend  to have a few Londoners as recipients. \r\nSee if
    anyone suits you.\r\n\r\n\u0192\r\n\r\n"

    never seen the magazines you mentioned anywhere. I guess they're english, but
    i'm sure there are some other mags i can find that could be useful. Thanks again.\r\n\r\nAny
    more suggestions are always welcome of course"
