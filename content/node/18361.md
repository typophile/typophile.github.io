body: "this post is more of a question, i suppose, of technique and purpose, than
  of a normal character set.\r\n\r\nwhich of the following samples do you like better?
  A, or B? my eye seems to glide over B better, so even though A is slightly more
  sophisticated in its 'curve bending', i think i like B better, with its more consistent
  color.\r\n\r\ncan anyone post a quick vote one way or the other?\r\n\r\nas for my
  earlier 'purpose' comment, please feel free to jump in and offer your thoughts:
  a pixel font such as this, is at its core, functional as opposed to decorative.
  as such, shouldn't i always design with readability in mind? that is to say, forego
  touches that i might personally like on a glyph level, in favor of flow once they
  are set into blocks?\r\n"
