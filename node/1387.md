body: Hello Typodudes &amp; dudesses, <BR>Can anyone ID this typeface used in a winery
  logo? Looks like a mish mash of 2 fonts to me. Closest I get is ITC Garamond bold
  italic but that&#39;s wrong for the cap &#39;R&#39;. The &#39;v&#39; is different
  too. Any help appreciated... <BR> <BR>&#92;newurl{http://www.fontfactory.com/font_id/Rothvale.jpg,http://www.fontfactory.com/font_id/Rothvale.jpg}{Rothdale

  body: Good morning, Paul <i>&#40;just arrived at work&#41;</i>. The main  <BR>type
    seems to be mechanically stretched <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times/bold-italic/testdrive.html?s=othvale&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Times Bold</a>. <BR>The swash capital is from another typeface.
    I&#39;ve seen  <BR>it before, but I&#39;ll have to look into it.

    that swash R from a system font,  <BR>Cursive Script or Corsiva or something like
    that?  <BR>Some standard Microsoft TrueType font? It would  <BR>make sense, as
    the stretched Times Bold Italic  <BR>points to amateurish self-made design.'

    the &#39;a&#39; doesn&#39;t look like Times though - does it? Had to laugh about
    the &#39;amateur hour&#39; line. It is a bit cheesy. Not my work folks! '
