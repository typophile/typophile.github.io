		<div class="commentbody">I like the logo very much. I like the colors very much. But...

There's too much going on that distracts from these great elements. The rounded corners of the logo's frame square don't match the style of the logo, and frankly, it's altogether unnecessary. If it were me, I'd scrap the square altogether or use it to encompass both logo and logotype (perhaps knocking out the logotype in white or a lighter color?)

The yellow knobs on the barbell need a smidgen more air to match the logo's other spaces.

The multicolor logotype isn't working for me. I'd use the darkest gray (only) from the logo square for the logotype. The scale is off, too - why is it so small compared to the logo? If you're going to have the barbell crushing the logotype, it needs to be look more intentional. :)

Have you searched for a font with more character? Perhaps something with more width (something burly like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/dienstag/black/|Dienstag]] or even [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/thinkdust/taku/|Taku]]) may compliment the logo better. Right now, the logotype looks wimpy and disconnected -  like an afterthought.

Now that I've torn it apart, let me add that I think it's pretty cool and headed in the right direction. The colors are especially pleasing, and work well to attract men and women to a fitness store, which I think can be quite hard. Well done. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rather than adding your newest draft in a new comment (in this thread of the forum) you edited your first comment, and removed the original draft. My top comment and James's comment refer to a logo that's been deleted -- and we can't edit our comments. Anyone who reads this thread will be confused. 

The whole idea of this forum is to critique the progression of a logo, and you won't get any feedback if people can't figure out what's going on.

Your new version needs some air. The logo is too close to the logotype, and the scale doesn't feel right. The two elements are competing with each other rather than working as a unit.

does this work better? i've added more air, but i don't know about the colour of 'HEROES' is that maybe why it might still seem like its competing? is the type better as well?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry, I did not see the first draft of this logo but hope I can make some helpful comments on what has been posted.

1. The newest version is now too spread out; The size of the letters is better but I would keep the kerning you had previously and move the type closer to the logo.

2. The white between the handle and the darker weights is smaller than the other spaces. My eye also goes to the rounded corners on the crossbar as they are the only thing not geometric about this logo and type.

3. There are too many gray's for my taste. Keep this version but make another that uses the darkest gray for the type and the weights (crossbar can stay orange).

Hope that helps. Good luck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What if you merge smaller weights (light gray disks) into the dark gray ones ? The concept behind the mark is a solid, but in its current form it looks too much like a weight and too little like an H. If the H were more obvious and the mark were a bit simpler, it'd look much better.

Also, agreed with Nachos regarding letter spacing. I think spacing in [[http://typophile.com/files/heroes_3973.jpg|this version]] worked really well.</div>

I’ll also mention that, through experience, I have bumped into a soft rule on this board that it is generally perceived as being more constructive to verbally direct than to offer a concrete visual solution. The exception is if a visual solution is requested. The thinking, I believe, is that it preempts the designers chance of arriving at the solution and puts them in the position of possibly using someone’s work other than their own.</div>

I wouldn't put the logo in a box.
I wouldn't worry about putting the type under the logo.
I would concentrate on the mark. 
Keep it simple.

The version posted at 10.19 (pst) has several that are good. I prefer no box and the type to be less dominant. But again, I don't think having the type weighted heavier than the logo is good.</div>

Interesting idea and it's good to test all your ideas, but the earlier posting had stronger designs. I'd like to see the type come down in size a few points to add more contrast the mark and give the overall design more interest. I enjoyed seeing your progression on this, nice work.</div>

I wholeheartedly agree here. Your issues with the form are being confused by the use of color and grayscale. Nail it down in black and white, then add color back where you want it. It helps tremendously.

As much as I love Avenir, the cap R is feeling a bit awkward. To make this work more as a logotype, I think you need to adjust it, lowering the crossbar of the R a little. I find it distracting.</div>

just throwing these out there:
it's feeling pretty clearly masculine - does that affect the female audience?
if masculine is the approach perhaps a different approach can be found ... with a different execution of the same concept ... it's just so ... plain. the simplicity is great, but the plainness is ... boring.<br />
