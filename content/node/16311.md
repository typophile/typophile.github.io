  body: "I think this is custom. It's the logo of the Baltic contemporary art centre
    in Gateshead, yeah? As far as I remember they had a full new typeface designed
    for use throughout their ID system. All of those suggestions are very close matches
    though.\r\n\r\nRobert\r\n\r\nEDIT: quick bit of Googling reveals <a href=\"http://www.spiked-online.com/Printable/00000006D98C.htm\">this
    article</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite>The Baltic is being branded to such an extent that the
    three-metre high ceramic letters that have been affixed to the facade for 50 years
    have now been made a protected typeface 'BALTIC Affisch'. Its font now adorns
    everything, from the B.Open banners to the B.Crew t-shirts worn by the designated
    helpers. It's all part of the crusade for City of Culture 2008, with Newcastle
    and Gateshead trying to develop a cultured identity.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nSo I guess
    it's based on the vernacular lettering originally used on what was the Baltic
    Flour Mill ... interesting.\r\n\r\nAnd another <a href=\"http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:dW_5eZV1ysEJ:www.balticmill.com/learning/downloads/B_INFO.pdf+baltic+affisch&hl=en\">here</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite>BALTIC
    Affisch\r\nThe letters are based on an old design form from the 1940s and\r\nnow
    form a protected typeface called BALTIC Affisch. The font\r\nwas based on old
    wooden blocks, used to print posters and\r\nnewspapers. The basic original design
    was produced by Ulf\r\nGreger and Henrik Nygren.\r\n\u2018BALTIC was an old industrial
    building, rough, black and white and\r\nsimple. So that is the basis of the choice
    for the graphic identity.\u2019\r\nSune Norgdren, Director.</cite>"
