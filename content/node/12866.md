  body: "I just received a reply from an email I sent to http://castcraft-software.com/\r\n\r\n\"We
    do have these fonts. These are two of our best selling fonts.  But base on your
    sample, there are two fonts that were used, Its OPTI Bookman Bold Italic Swash
    & OPTI Bookman Bold Italic Swash with Supplement. We have it in True Type or PostScript
    for MAC or PC.  The fonts cost $67.50 each plus $10 for handling.  We can email
    or shipped it to you.  You can call us at (847)675-6530 and look for Harry or
    Felix for your payment information.\""

  body: "You are one of the first people I ever heard from that actually got a response
    from them.  I looked after seeing your post, and found images of these to confirm
    that all the characters are there in those fonts. It looks like they gave you
    the right information. The non-swash italic letters are in the first font, and
    all the swash letters, including the 'y' are in the Supplement. That allows them
    to charge for two fonts, and at such hefty prices too. In all fairness I should
    say that there are two versions of most of the upper case letters in the Supplement,
    as well as a scattering of swash lower case letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Do these fonts come on solid gold CD-ROMs?"

    handling such fragile items. One misstep and you've got yourself a useless, shattered
    font.\r\n\r\nYa know, I wouldn't be surprised if Castcraft shipped the fonts on
    floppy disks."

    the $67 type. I found a similar style and used Illustrator to edit it. All I needed
    were a few letters.\r\n\r\nthanks again."
