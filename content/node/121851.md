  script used in this piece by April Greiman [img:sites/default/files/old-images/edd6fe5e01447577147182dfcb4bd3db_5905.jpg]\r\n\r\nA
  rounded version may also have been used for the 'Working Girl' film titles.\r\n(may
  be another typeface though)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aa4bf1607b68211c8339f0669339ad80_4128.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nJ"
