body: "Dear typophiles, \r\n\r\nHalf a year ago I wanted to make a logo for myself.
  After drawing the required letters, I thought: \"Maybe I should complete the alphabet.\"
  It evolved into quite an obsession from there on. I am now at a point where I'd
  appreciate some honest feedback on where this got me and push me in the right direction
  concerning neccessary refinements. \r\n\r\nI would be very thankful if you could
  take a look at it and tell me what you think. I myself am quite happy with the Thin
  to Regular weights and not too shure about the Heavy one (the bold interpolates
  between Regular and Heavy). I plan to add matched Italics once I have finished (if
  possible) the upright versions. A (friend of mine told me that the contrast in character
  width from Thin to Heavy might be too big. I find it acceptable, because I wanted
  to preserve the form of the counters and I think it looks like a condensed if I
  reduce the characters' widths.\r\n\r\nAlso, only aside: Is the naming acceptable?
  I like to set body text in lighter weights myself so I called the lighter-than-regular
  weight \"Book\". Is this confusing? Also: Is the Heavy really Heavy or rather Black?\r\n\r\nI
  have attached a specimen which is far from finalized (the typeface is NOT going
  to be called Handgloves, i have not found a proper name yet). The texts in it are
  not to be taken too seriously, I just filled the empty space with what came to my
  head. If you need additional samples I'd be happy to provide them.\r\n\r\nI think
  my girlfriend thinks I am gone mad by now. She gives me a quite pitiful look when
  she sees me sunken in \"my world of letters\". \r\n\r\nI also want to thank you
  guys on Typophile for the input you gave me without knowing. I have been reading
  here now for weeks and it is very rare to find a place where such intelligent folks
  talk about this kind of nerdy (in a good way!) matter in such a professional yet
  civilized and friendly tone. Always honest, never snobby. Keep up this spirit!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Specimensample_5453.jpg]"

    g to the single-storey one, so I will see into this and try to make it a bit lighter
    in the middle part.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In the Heavy weight, you might investigate
    more use of ink traps and/or subtle tapering of strokes leading in to the acute
    intersections. Otherwise it looks fine to me.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI have thought
    about ink traps. Tapering may help, but I didn't want to move away too far from
    the more uniform look of the lighter weights' lines. But then the Heavy one would
    probably only be used in display applications like headlines. I personally don't
    like the whole \"ink traps as design features in display sizes\"-craze. Maybe
    I am going to add ink traps to the Regular version and call it \"Text\" for print
    applications.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>You need more overshoot on curves and sharp angles.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis
    was something I really wasn't sure about. The type was a bit \"squarisher\" some
    time ago and I did never change the overshoot. I had 5 units of overshoot on round
    characters (the x-height is 500, so it's 1%). Is there any rule of thumb in which
    region overshoot would be unit-wise?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Is the bold intended to

    thought to serve as a weight for highlighting body text. I'll see how to proceed
    with that. Maybe I'll just add a bit of weight to the bold. Or throwing out the
    regular alltogether and bolden the Book version a bit. But then the regular is
    one of the three the interpolation is based upon, so it would be a bit of a waste..."

    amounts of overshoot. "

    to the club! Just one thing: you can't leave.\r\n\r\nIt's actually quite nice
    I think, especially considering you've only been doing type design for half a
    year! However it will be hard making it stand out in this crowded genre...\r\n\r\nI
    agree with Alex about the \"g\" - it's the only big sore spot. It's trying too
    hard. Simplify it, especially the bottom-left terminal. You might even try a Danish
    \"g\" or a Koch \"g\". Also, the \"x\" is too geometric - try staggering at least
    one pair of opposing arms. Capitals: The \"C\" seems too wide; the \"K\" is too
    bland. BTW, that's one of the nicest \"5\"s I've seen.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Book\":
    People use it to mean both lighter than Regular, and heavier! So label the weight
    you think is best for text Regular, and the other one Book.\r\n\r\nOvershoots:
    You do indeed need more (and don't judge it by the screen... unless it's a screen
    font, in which case however there's a whole different mindframe to factor in).
    There's no formula for ideal overshoot, since it depends on a number of things;
    I use 10-16 for text. BTW darker weights need more overshoot (otherwise they look
    short); try a difference of 4 between each weight.\r\n\r\nWeight separations:
    As Craig said, think in pairings. Looking casually I would say that the darkest
    two (especially the Bold) need to be darker.\r\n\r\nTrapping: Do do it, but not
    for any display-centric styles. BTW:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html\r\n\r\nItalics:
    Please don't make a boring traditional one; in fact that could be where this stands
    out from the crowd.\r\n\r\nLastly, the name... Something nicely cold. What about
    Alpina?\r\n\r\nOh, and whatever you do, keep it up! One day your girl will be

    don't indent to leave. Yet.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>However it will be hard making

    excentric when I started. With a kind of broken-script look. But then I wanted
    to really learn something doing my first typeface. I thought I should learn from
    what to abstract before doing anything too fancy. Then I find that there aren't
    <em>that</em> many geometric sans text faces with decent language support and
    matching italics apart from the classics. When I began I never thought about selling
    this. After studying the Myfonts <em>New Fonts</em> lists for some time I think
    I'll try to offer it there at a reasonable price and see how it works out.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I

    then, if two persons tell me on first sight that something's not right about it,
    you are propably right. I changed it to a more classic type (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B8upnx-TIQeYdWczd1cyX25hVHc\">Click
    here for a new specimen</a>). Maybe I'll include a revised version of the old
    one as a variant, along with a more \"contemporary\" symmetric \"K\", because
    I like the current \"K\" in it's blandness. As for Koch and Danish \"g\"s: I had
    to look them up first. I consider the Danish one, but personally don't like the
    Koch one too much. In my own design work, I have more than once encountered great
    fonts in which single characters were deal breakers for deviating too much from
    \"standard\" letterforms. Therefore I rather go on the side of boredom in the
    default stylistic sets and include everything else as alternates. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>BTW,

    \"non-traditional\" Italics:\r\nI guess my stance is more relevant to serif fonts,
    where I value the slanted-Roman concept (albeit with more sensitivity than is
    typical) much more than most; in sans designs it's harder to stand apart without
    being too unorthodox. So I'm not sure specifically what to recommend... Just follow
    your own original logic instead of repeating bad precedents.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    InDesign, letters are much closer, but it looks a bit unbalanced, especially in
    the thinner weights. I roughly followed the spacing advice in Karen Cheng's <em>Designing
    Type</em>.\r\n\r\nAlso, what is the best practice spacing the lowercase |i| with
