  body: i meant the quality of the letters in the sample. thought they were inconsistent
    due to editing of small sample. but nah.

  body: So then no idea of the font? I thought it had similarities to Fraktur but
    I am of course looking for an exact match :)

  body: Given the fact that not a single letter has the same proportions or features
    like another, I suspect it is all hand lettering, most likely even with a pen,
    not a quill.

  body: "and pre-digital i'd say. even though you might be borderline with the dates
    when fonts were being used digitally stuff like this was not likely available
    for a few years. If you want exact, start drawing :)\r\notherwise find an available
    blackletter font and enjoy!"
