  a pop culture moment, which somehow both irritates and entertains many. I'd be curious
  to hear any reactions here on Typophile, or perhaps any historical insights. One
  commenter asked when the practice stopped being used for movie posting titling,
  such as:\r\n\r\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ec_bXQZWE2E/ScFbNCk9xBI/AAAAAAAAC7Q/ZVbNRPWZSIg/s400/771968773_44dc6a38c1_o.jpg\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nhttp://www.movieposter.com/posters/archive/main/21/A70-10700\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Some of the uses people are labeling as abuses seem perfectly fine to me,
    the target ads in your post for example. It seems obvious to me that they are
    being employed to identify a faux-testimonial, customers thinking the prices were
    "unbelievable" or "surprising," i.e. doing what quotation marks are for, quoting.

  body: "Andr\xE9 - Thanks for reading and very good point. I struggled with that
    idea before finally posting because technically you're correct by some definitions.
    The term \"scare quotes\" though seems to have been expanded a bit from how it
    was originally coined. For example, when <a href=\"http://micusp.elicorpora.info/micusp-kibbitzers/1-scare-quotes-in-micusp-some-prelimin\">studying
    scare quotes in collegiate writing</a>, the researchers laid out a set of characteristics
    that defined scare quotes as \"uses of quotation marks that are not standard in
    the same way.\" (see link) It's possible I misunderstood them, you're welcome
    to double-check. I felt as though that practice was repeated elsewhere, however.
    When Greil Marcus was talking about scare quotes at the Harvard University Press
    Blog, he didn't define them, but did use the term in a variety of ways that I
    believe exceed how \"scare quotes\" are defined in a strict sense.\r\n\r\nIn the
    end, I didn't think it was my place to invent a new, unused term for different
    kinds of quotation marks, but rather simply discuss them as they are currently
    being used in design using common language. As I point out in the article, a lexicographer
    did attempt to invent a new term -- \"shout quotes\" -- but received a lot of
    hateful comments for it; and that's his job.\r\n\r\nYou're welcome by all means
    to call them \"emphasis quotes\" or \"shout quotes\", I just used language that
    I felt was commonly being used to describe them. \r\n\r\n"

  body: qualitycontrol - I applaud your open mindedness. Perhaps I should not have
    described the article above as the "The use, misuse and abuse of quotation marks"
    because in no part of the article do I describe any of the examples as an abuse.
    However, they are certainly perceived that way by some. The Target signage using
    made up quotes within quotation marks is not exactly an acceptable formal practice.
    More importantly, typographically, it strikes me as really intriguing, not just
    because it's a trend, but also because of the way the meaning and perception of
    the phrase is so easily shifted.
