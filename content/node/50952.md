  body: "Futura, of course... look at the f's. I'm deeply ashamed of myself for not
    picking up on that myself, the stretched width 'M\" just completely threw me.
    What is even more embarrassing, is that on the cover, 'SOLARIS' is set in Futura
    Thin as well. Oh my, I must have been having a proper dense day indeed.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again fella. :o)\r\n\r\nG"
