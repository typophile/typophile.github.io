body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nSo I work in-hose for an architecture firm, and we have some
  of our people doing business in Abu Dhabi. We need to print up business cards with
  english and arabic translations on them. Although I consider myself very discerning
  of roman characters in typography, i have no clue what I\u2019m doing in arabic.\r\n\r\nMy
  company won\u2019t spring for any new fonts, as this is pretty much a one-off thing,
  but my computer has six arabic fonts (i believe they are Mac Standard, yet I can\u2019t
  seem to find samples on the web...). I would like to avoid the middle-eastern equivalent
  of comic sans, and (as closely as possible) match the Avenir that already appears
  on the card. We have an architect in-house who can translate.\r\n\r\nMy choices
  are:\r\nAl Bayan\r\nBagdhad\r\nDeco Type Naskh\r\nGeeza Pro\r\nKufi Standard GK\r\nNadeem\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate any help that I could get...\r\n\r\nA"

  body: Kufi Standard GK is probably the best choice of the mentioned typefaces. The
    geometric  appearance of the typeface slightly matches the appearance of Avenir.

  body: I was looking at that, but I wasn't sure if it was really forced. That is
    to say, I've heard people talk about trying to make Arabic type (or any other
    language system) "helvetica-ized", and completely losing the forms in the process.
    It looked to me like it would be the equivalent of a "techno" font, with really
    forced curves and lack of contrasts. I think that first, I want to make sure that
    the letters look good, then matching avenir comes next...

  body: "It is true that Kufi doesn't look like a traditional Arabic typeface due
    to its geometric nature. However Dubai doesn't have the appearance of a typical
    middle eastern country. I have recently seen a lot of Arabic geometric typefaces
    in use, most memorable was during the recent Bahrain f1 gran prix and this years
    TDC winning text family Al Rajhi. I personally really like them. I can understand
    why many Arab nations believe they are an insult to their cultural traditions.\r\n\r\nI
    am guessing Arabic geometric inspired typefaces haven't been around for a long
    period of time. It is only a matter of time before they become more accepted in
    certain countries like Dubia and Bahrain. The west had similiar acceptance issues
    with grotesques and early geometrics during the early twentieth century because
    of the radical change.\r\n\r\nI would give it a test setting to see if it works.
    If it does still feel to \"techno\". I would use Nadeem or Geeza since they appear
    slightly minimal but still have an element of Arabic calligraphy to them,"

  body: "You might try UKIJ fonts, a wide variety there. Also, SIL puts out Lateef
    and Scheherazade, both nice looking. Finally, there are the Paktype fonts. Any
    of these may suit you. Check the license first.\r\nPersonally, I'd go for a nice
    Nastaliq, or Sulus face for any names.\r\n\r\nWhy aren't you using whatever service
    others use in-country? There likely is some \"standard\" font, layout, etc., and
    it might be better to fit in rather than splash in."
