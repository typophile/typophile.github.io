<div class=commentbody>Have/had this problem over here in Germany too, whenever i wanted to go to fontshop.com i got redirected to fontshop.de. Being grown up (well, almost) i usually know where i want to go and why (much better preview option. in this case…).
For me it always worked to just enter the FS.com-url again after having been redirected to FS.de, hit enter, done.
And yes, i find it truly annoying too, the internet is an open, international kind of thing and websites that redirect me elsewhere simply because of my IP-address or browser language are somewhat out of order in terms of usability, compliance with user expectations, etc. Plus it just doesn't fit in the general picture i have of FS as a very helpful, customer oriented company.
I truly hope FS will do something about that, soon.</div>

I can't. In HTML there is no other use of a double-click, than bypassing a FontShop redirect. ;-)
But it works for me in any browser or newsreader. I don't know enough about FontShops redirect mechanism to tell you why this works. Maybe it's just a bug and the redirect doesn't work if you fire multiple calls to the website, or maybe they included this trick on purpose as a backdoor, so the guys in Berlin can look at their international sites once in a while ...

We feel your pain. FontShop is working on a solution for keeping content open to all, while still directing customers to their local FontShop when necessary (purchasing). Unfortunately, this will take some time. In the meantime, Ralf's trick should work.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The FSI network is organized so that local FontShops can serve (and sell to) their own region. This comes with some drawbacks, but mostly positives. Where there is a local FontShop, marketing materials and support services are appropriate to each region's needs and language. Tangible goods cost less to ship. Events, like <a href=http://www.typoberlin.de>TYPO Berlin</a>, strengthen and engage the local design community.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Stephen, I see that this is useful in some way.
But concerning fonts (and the above stated articles, see as well e.g. http://typophile.com/node/34986) I think this policy works counterproductively. At least I have meanwhile ended up buying the fonts/font families I needed at other vendors.
Double clicking or hitting "enter" several times doesn't work at my computer either. But alas, there seems to be hope :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Spy software, Uli? Seriously? Having worked at FontShop and been involved directly in oversight of web development projects there, I can attest to the fact that trying to find out what fonts users have installed on their hard drives was never on the extremely long dev wishlist. The good people at FontShop have more important things to think about, like how to market typefaces, service customers, and take care of designers who choose to work with them.
Cookies are a fact of internet life, and not typically intended for nefarious purposes (at least when browsing the online shops of reputable companies).
With regard to the issue of being directed to your home country/region's website for font purchases, the folks at FontShop have struggled with that and are really trying to build a good user experience while adhering to contractual agreements with the various local FontShops. The global market is not always as easy to implement as we would like, but rest assured, these people really *are* trying.

<div class=commentbody>The purpose of cookies is to hand over information from one pageview to the next (or one visit to the next visit). This is necessary because the client (browser) and the server have no persistent connection.
If a website wants to monitor the user's fonts (which is possible), cookies won't help.

http://www.fonts.info/local-fonts-in-html/
<cite>"With Flash a webdesigner can access the user's fonts with the command getFontList();"</cite>
Cookies and Flash are only the first step for Linotype, etc.
The important step is to embed into your fonts
- your first, your middle and your last name,
- your street name and your street number,
- your city and your zip code and your country,
- your email address and your phone number,
- your bank account and credit card number,
- your private identification number
(for sample see http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/lino17.pdf)
so that all other commercial websites that you visit can easily access all your private data by simply reading the fonts on your computer.
The fonts personalized by the Linotype method are labeled by hackers as "PIF fonts" ("Private Identification Fonts"), as such PIF fonts can be easily used for gleaning all your private data.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Fontshop.com has a drop down region selection menu, why do you even need the auto redirect. You could easily make that more prevalent and add it to the european country pages. And if people in Austria want to read and purchase in English, then maybe add the region selector in the shopping cart section as well. Like before you can pay you have to choose your region, so you can still retain the marketing information.
