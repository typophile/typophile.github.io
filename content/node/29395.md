    like an after thought, I mean having the color picker set in RGB mode? come on.
    Sorry off topic\u2026\r\n\r\nTo answer your question, yes the ability to punch
    in a number and have it go to the right swatch is buggy. If you type all the numbers
    in really fast it will jump to it, if you mess it up and try with the mistaken
    numbers it won't go to the correct swatch. I've found hitting one and letting
    it go to 100 then going back to the start of the numbers and trying again will
    yield good results. "
