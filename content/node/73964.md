  body: "According to the Hoefler & Frere-Jones [[http://www.typography.com/ask/faq.php?faqID=107#Faq_107|website]]
    in the FAQ section:\r\n\r\nWhat font is used in the \"H&FJ\" logo? The ornate
    \"H&FJ\" in the background of our logo isn't a typeface, it's a piece of lettering
    created by Jonathan Hoefler. The words \"Hoefler & Frere-Jones\" in the foreground
    are set in Tobias Frere-Jones' Gotham Bold typeface.\r\n\r\nAlthough what you
    posted isn't the logo, I would assume the response might still apply."

  body: I thought it would be something like that. I was asked if I could find it
    by a colleague, I don't even know where she got this. I'm going to point her to
    the website. Maybe she can hire Johnathan?
