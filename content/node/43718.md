body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nWe were having a discussion at my agency about the Helvetica
  movie. All in all, it's a nugget and we dug it.\r\nBut do any of You esteemed colleagues
  here at Typophile know of any movie about <em>graphic design</em> done in the same
  vein? Not an historical account of design per se, rather a more contemporary view
  on the different aspects of the corporate identity. Preferrably featuring brilliant
  sound bite men and women like Erik Spiekermann, Michael Bierut or Paula Scher. Or
  something such like?\r\nIt could be shorter, it could have a less attractive soundtrack,
  it could be made by you. I'm curious to see what comes to mind.\r\n\r\nKind regards,
  \r\n\u0192.\r\n"

  body: Typomania is great, unfortunately it's a bit, um, type-centric. I'll bump
    this thread up a bit. And considering the day, no documentaries on the fair life
    on the island San Serriffe are really what I had in mind either.
