  know, but it's not !\r\nI'm stuck with a font ID and without my special tools I
  just can't find what it is !\r\nI hope you guys can help.\r\n\r\nIt has Font Bureau's
  Eagle look and feel, but the G is more like Futura's\r\n\r\nThe Q has a vertical
  queue\r\n\r\nIt has a uppercase \xE7\r\n\r\nIt's beautiful... What else ?"
