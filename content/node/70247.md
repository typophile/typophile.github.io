body: "I have a corporate client whose font is Calibri.\r\nThis was chosen because
  the majority of their communication is on-screen and also because they like to generate
  their own documents from word (god help me).\r\n\r\nThey have now come to me with
  a book design project and have expressed a desire to use Calibri throughout.\r\n\r\nAny
  opinions regarding this will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n"

  body: "Calibri is a good typeface per se. As for its suitability in a book, it obviously
    depends on the type of book.\r\nIf there\u2019s lot of running text, you could
    suggest to use a more \u201Csafe\u201D serif typeface, and use Calibri just for
    headers and such."

  body: 'Yes, it depends what sort of book, and also what kind of layout. If the design
    is more like a magazine or an annual report, then Calibri is a possibility: give
    plenty of leading and set text in columns. If they layout is more like a traditional
    book, then use a serif face for text and limit Calibri to headers.'

    for you.

  body: It's a small company in AUstralia. I'd give you their name, but their website
    isn't a great example of quality design. sorry.
