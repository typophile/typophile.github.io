  is, I decided to find out the typeface involved to utilise it for a few of my own
  projects.\r\n\r\nI cant quite put my finger on the name, though, and I'd be most
  greatful if any of you could help me along:\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n[EDIT]:
  It appears the file upload service isn't working -- the image can be found <a href=\"http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/7809/rubygrandlogode2.jpg\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    \u2018techno\u2019 or \u2018geometric\u2019). The archetype of those geometric,
    extremely simplified fonts is Herbert Bayer\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/bayer-universal/\">Universal</a>
    (digital version by P22)."

    Sans</a> but the arches look rather different to the original.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    your suggestion Florian, its a fantastic typeface nonetheless, something I'll
    definately be keeping in mind for future endeavours!"
