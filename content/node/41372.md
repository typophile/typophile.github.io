  find. I'm wondering about the font used for \"Millennial Harbinger\"--that's the
  large, woodcut-looking font. \r\n\r\nI abjectly apologize for the poor image resolution.
  I'm thinking that the font is so distinctive, though, that someone might recognize
  it. Again, it's from an 1831 newspaper. \r\n\r\nAny leads?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nChris "
