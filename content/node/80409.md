  body: "You will not find a symmetrical \"L\". However, you could go for lowercase
    (but then, it would be very narrow.\r\nYou could try with an upside-down \"T\"."

  body: With a slab, it might be easier to optically center the L because you can
    counteract it's asymmetry with a heavy serif. Also a monospaced font might be
    worth trying, and also a grotesque of some kind because they usually have rather
    uniform widths in the capitals. All suggestions for stacking. Rotating is another
    story. I highly suggest you consider employing some of thetalent lurking around
    here. Most of the long timers are type designers that would be able to produce
    a tailor-made product for your needs.

  body: The problem I have noticed is with the 'M'(and sometimes 'N' also) as its
    width is visibly more than the other letters in the word. Considering squishing
    it. But if you know of any font/s that already have all 'same width' letters,
    pls name them.
