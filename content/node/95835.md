body: "Hello all--\r\nI've got an in-progress here that needs your eyes. It's based
  on a hastily designed logo for a paper sculpture artist that I thought had some
  potential as a full set of letters. It's a bit of a mash-up of different elements
  but here's the main points I want: display face, high contrast, flared serifs and
  abrupt wedge serifs, large x-height, and some other thin, swashy elements and unconventional
  forms are ok with me since I envision it being used at large sizes. I'd also like
  to make light and ultra weights too.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Papreo_01_4213.png]"

  body: "I don't think these new thin joints would cause any substantial conflict.
    The letter shapes are well defined and distinct. But I would trust my own eye,
    esse est percipi ;-)\r\n\r\nDitto, I like the new /k/. The top has more stress
    than before, it became almost a bit squarish. I suppose you wanted the squarishness
    of the capitals to recur. \r\n\r\nThe bottom left of /s/ seems too thin.\r\n\r\nI
    would have liked an /O/ more in keeping with /C/ and /B/. Generally, I notice
    two different curve styles in your capital alphabet (and both work as seen in
    the mixed-case setting). Right now I like more the vibe of the lowercase than
    the uppercase, I don't know why, but it may be because of the two divergent styles.
    I like how /c/ and /C/ relate to each other. In short, my question is if the all-caps
    setting works as well as the mixed-case.\r\n\r\nThe triangle serif of /K/ looks
    too big.\r\n\r\nI like what you did with the /q/.\r\n\r\nKeep up the enjoyable
    work!"

  body: I don't know if the disconnected stems of /M/,/N/,/V/,/W/ are working for
    the regular weight. In the light weight they definitely look weird to my eyes,
    however. They don't disappear smoothly like the thins of the lowercase. I can
    understand it does not make much sense to thin out those stems "smoothly", as
    they are already hairlines as they approach the diagonal. Not sure how one could
    solve this...

    slightly thicker, they appear too thin to me (in comparison to the other lines).
    The /A/ crossbar disturbs me a bit with its geometrical straightness (it makes
    the left \"overshoot\" I guess).  \r\nMaybe I would add some extra volume to the
    legs at /R/ and /K/ letters to compensate missing ending serifs in order to add
    more stability.  (light version)\r\nAnd one more point:  The dollar sign is missing
    contrast at upper right and lower left side (the ending swashes) (for me)\r\nThat's
    all from my side :)\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nJan"
