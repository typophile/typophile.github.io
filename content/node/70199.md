  trying to help someone identify this font she wants to use for her wedding announcement.
  She asked someone at the shop and they told her it's \"Roman E Script,\" but I can't
  find anything by that name. She took these photos of the signage. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nFor
  extra credit, I'd also like to know what the font is used for CHILDREN'S SELECTION
  that is cut off at the top in the second shot."

    distinctive information in the lower portion of some of those letters to make
    an ID."

    of the 'R', I'd say it's a hand-painted representation of <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/new-yorker-type/\"
