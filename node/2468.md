  body: Those are from the posters. I think he&#39;s looking for the fonts used in
    the titles.

    they&#39;ve been redrawn.'

  body: The O, E, and Q are definitely Koberger. The T is also  <BR>Koberger, but
    the curved stroke has been chewed on. The I  <BR>looks like they took the one
    from Koberger but cut it in half  <BR>and flipped a copy of the top half for the
    bottom. The A  <BR>just looks made up, maybe from parts of other characters,  <BR>but
    it&#39;s hard to tell.
