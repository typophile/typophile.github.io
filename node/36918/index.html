<p>No, that isn&rsquo;t a correct characterisation of the Hague programme. So of the instructors likely utilise Gerrit Noordzij&rsquo;s stroke theory in their approach, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be confused with calligraphy. I don&rsquo;t know very much about details of the the Hague programme, so can&rsquo;t speak in its favour or against it.</p>
<p>I can, however, pretty unreservedly recommend the programme at Reading in the UK. Among other things you should note is that a remarkably high number of Reading graduates get jobs in the type business pretty immediately after graduation. Past graduates are currently employed at Adobe, Cannibal, Dalton Maag, Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones, House Industries, Linotype, Monotype Imaging, Porchez Typofonderie, etc., and we&rsquo;re interviewing a couple of the current students for a job.</p>

<p>They try to get a good variety of people at Reading, which seems to work out pretty well. Of the 14 of us graduating this year, I think only half had ever tried making a typeface before. We have a few people just out of undergrad programs, a part-time architect, and a lot of graphic designers with with different levels of experience looking to shift our careers into type design or just add it to the mix of what we do. There&rsquo;s almost a thirty-year age difference between the youngest and the oldest, too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is difficult to paint a typical profile, but we are looking primarily for demonstrable experience in document design, over lettering and typeface design: how existing typefaces are used, rather than how new ones are made. This reflects a strong view that typeface design is inseparable from its contexts, and that it is through these that one can best enter the discipline. In practical terms, a brief for a typeface is incomplete without some thought going into document types and genres, text modes, scales, and usage scenarios.</p>
<p>We are also looking for evidence of visual skills, good working practices, and the ability to sustain a long project with fluid milestones. And the ideal candidate will be a thinking designer, interested in reflecting on the process of design as much as explaining it. Age and background are no issue, so long as the typographic skills and the intellectual curiosity are there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Type &amp; Media course at the KABK in The Hague embraces the philosophy of ‘learning by doing’, and will very much appeal to people who are looking for a practical study. A number of tutors (Petr van Blokland, Peter Verheul, Erik van Blokland, Frank Blokland) are former students of Gerrit Noordzij and his theories about stroke and contrast are utilised in the course.</p>
<p>The first semester is dedicated to learning the basics of type design and covers a wide variety of topics including letter sketching, Python programming, calligraphy, design philosophy, letter carving, type history and much more. The second semester is dedicated to the graduation project where students are guided individually by the tutors.</p>
<p>The Type &amp; Media course is short, but very intense - students are required to attend the course for at least four days a week during the whole year. Next tot that visits to the Typo Berlin conference, Plantin Moretus museum in Antwerp, the Enschedé archive in Haarlem and other typographically interesting places are organised yearly.</p>
<p>Former students of the course have found jobs in the type industry, won international awards, or have published typefaces since. For instance - Artur Schmal designed Parry for OurType, Pieter van Rosmalen runs his own CakeType foundry, Andy Clymer found a position at Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones, Nikola Djurek designed Amalia (for OurType) and Porta (for Dutch Type Library), and Ian Party is a tutor in type design at the ECAL and runs the B&amp;P Typefoundry. Laura Meseguer won a TDC award for Rumba, as did Christina Bee for her typeface Olga.</p>
<p>Concerning what type of students are admitted to the course, like Gerri already wrote for his course in Reading: it’s difficult to define a typical profile. Affinity, passion, sincerity, personality and skill are all important.</p>

It is hard to calculate exactly how much time is spent on calligraphic exercises during the first semester. Both Erik van Blokland and Peter Verheul cover it in their classes, but this is combined with exercises in drawing type on paper, exercises in spacing, contrast and more. These classes are not about mastering calligraphy, but about understanding the principles of type design by practicing and looking at calligraphy. I recommend looking at Gerrit Noordzij’s book ‘The Stroke’ if you want to know more about this subject. It’s widely available online, including [[http://www.amazon.com/Stroke-Theory-Writing-Gerrit-Noordzij/dp/0907259308|Amazon]] and [[http://www.typotheque.com/books/the_stroke/|Typotheque]].</p>
<p>These two classes combined take one day a week, and students can (voluntarily) attend Frank Blokland’s calligraphy classes as well. Considering the total amount of classes add up to four days a week, I’d say that calligraphy amounts to approx. 1/4 of the first semester. The second semester has virtually no classes in specific subjects.</p>
<p>@Marilyn
Naturally, it helps when applicants have experience in designing type but it does not guarantee anything. And the same applies vice versa. Applicants need to show excellent design skills in general (a BA in a design discipine is highly recommended) with their portfolio. And next to that they need to be able to explain clearly the motivation for applying at Type &amp; Media.</p>
<p>Portfolios and motivations can be sent by e-mail or regular mail to Jan Willem Stas, the Type &amp; Media coordinator. Or you can approach me (Paul van der Laan) or Erik van Blokland personally when you catch either one of us somewhere.</p>
<p>Visiting the KABK Open Day on 26 January 2008 is highly recommended too.</p>

I would still really like to apply for the 09 session, however. In a few brief e-mails with Jan Willem Stas, he said sending a portfolio, CV and motivational letter by the end of the year would be safe &ndash; since I&rsquo;m in the U.S., I need time for my Visa to clear.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate it if you could send me more information about the Type Media program &ndash; any curriculum, case studies of projects, etc. Thanks for your help!</p>

I would like to have more information about that Open Day of the KABK on 26 Jan 08.
I&rsquo;m wondering about what time the Open Day starts, and things like that. I have searched for it on the KABK-website, but I could not find anything about it. I&rsquo;d appreciate it.</p>

That would be nice, a typophile invasion in Den Haag. ;)
And thanks for the compliment. About my BA, I&rsquo;ve already finished a 4 year study in graphic design, before I started the one I&rsquo;m doing now, but that was not for a BA (I would have to explain the Dutch educational system, but I think that would be boring). The fonts on my site are actually the first ones I ever did, not very good, but I learned a lot while making them.</p>
<p>And I think the classes on Type&amp;Media are usually given in English.</p>

Would love to hear about the Dutch system some day though. Maybe I should apply for a teaching position there some day. It&rsquo;s a very interesting country from a typographic/design point of a view (Probably the most interesting at the moment and has been so for a while)</div>

I can explain the system a bit sometime, but I don&rsquo;t think I should hijack your thread for it. ;) I make it sound all difficult, but it isn&rsquo;t, really.
And usually theres indeed all kinds of things designy happening overhere.
Teaching position sounds good, I&rsquo;ve had teachers from several different countries in the last two years, currently one from Poland (he incidentally also teaches at the KABK, but not a type designer).</div>

<p>Traditionally, the KABK Open Day is from 10.00 till 17.00 and I don’t expect that the next one will be different. When you’re planning to come, please let us know by sending an e-mail.</p>
<p>To find more examples of work and projects of (former) Type &amp; Media students I’d recommend to Google for &lsquo;type media kabk&rsquo;. We hope to include more examples of work and projects on the official KABK website in due time, but luckily some of our former students have published their work on personal websites.</p>
<p>The official language for the Type &amp; Media course is English, since the majority of students (90%) are from outside The Netherlands. During the last five years we’ve been host to more than 25 different nationalities. The KABK website has quite an extensive section with info for international students. Although this is aimed mainly at exchange students for the BA courses, most of it applies to Type &amp; Media too: <a href="http://www.kabk.nl/English/index.xml">http://www.kabk.nl/English/index.xml</a></p>
<p>The tuiton fee for last year was 1519,- Euros for EU students. For more info about current tuiton fees, and fees for non-EU students I’d recommend to send an e-mail to the student administration.</p>

In addition to what you can read about the Reading program on the [[http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/home.html?courses/postgraduate/type.html|university&rsquo;s site]], it would be worth having a look at [[http://typefacedesign.org|typefacedesign.org]] to have a look at current work and the program&rsquo;s wiki, which links to lots of design and writing work by graduates, as well as some more info about the program and life in Reading.</div>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be paying the overseas fees at Reading, but like UK students (and Swedes, it seems), I can at least borrow the necessary amount in US student loans. I noticed last year that it is not possible to get US Stafford or PLUS loans for study at KABK, even though some other Dutch schools are listed with the US Department of Education. Do American students at Type &amp; Media just not take out loans? Or do they rely on higher-interest private loans? Not really a deciding factor when deciding where to study, but still interesting…</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Note also that the Swiss seem unwilling to let the English and the Dutch have type design education all to themselves!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how far off the ground this is yet. It seems that they want to create a two-year MA program. Unlike Reading and KABK, the language of instruction in this program is German, but they explicitly state that they will accommodate French-speakers as well. I anticipate that this program may rise to become a central European juggernaut at some point. Who knows what the future will hold. There was a time when Reading and KABK were just the University of Reading and the Royal Academy of the Arts in The Hague, i.e., not yet international brand names in the niche market of higher education typeface design ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Paul, it seems so. I don&rsquo;t know much about this program in Zürich at all. But they were advertising it with flyers and brochures at TYPO Berlin in May, and I met with some regular undergraduate students from Zürich in Berlin who were talking it up. I think that this is intended as just the foundation for a future Masters course, i.e., this isn&rsquo;t on the same level as Reading or KABK (yet). However, as far as Graphic Design programs go, I&rsquo;ve heard that the reputation of Zürich is very high in German-speaking countries. The competition for undergraduate spaces is also said to be very fierce. Despite having heard about this potential future program, I&rsquo;m still quite happy to be starting the MA course at Reading in three weeks ;-)</div>

<p>On the topic of tuition costs for non-EU students, I don&rsquo;t recall exactly how much I paid but as an American student at the KABK I don&rsquo;t belive the tuition was much more (or anything more) than the figure Paul van der Laan quoted, which is truly a bargain for what you&rsquo;re getting. The total cost of supporting myself for a year of living in The Netherlands including tuition, living expenses and a resident permit for being non-EU, came out to far less than the tuition alone would have been at an art academy in the states.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, about every ten minutes there is a train ride from Reading to London which takes about a half hour to get at Paddington station. If you leave from a town somewhere in between you will have to catch a slower train and I&rsquo;m not sure how often they go an hour. So&hellip; Reading is actually well connected (same for some airports).</p>
<p>Expenses (either tuition fee as living) are quite a lot higher in the UK than they are in the Netherlands, but it&rsquo;s worth it.. At least it was for me&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanks Endre for starting this great thread and everyone else&rsquo;s input, I guess I should work on my portfolio for the rest of this semester to line up more with Typography.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul, how large a written component is there in the Hague programme? At Reading, in addition to their type design projects, MA students also produce a research dissertation and a ’reflection on practice’ that documents their design process.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In the first semester students do a project where type history is involved and for this project a paper must be written. In the second semester – where students work on their graduation projects – they are required to document (and annotate) their design process. This project book (together with additional material required for the examinaton) must be presented at the graduation show.</p>
<p>That being said, I do have the impression that the course in Reading puts a higher emphasis on the written part, whereas the Type &amp; Media course is more focusssed on the practical part of type design.</p>

<p>H&amp;FJ has the kind of environment where everyone has their hands in a little bit of everything, but in the past year or so I spent some quality time with a custom font for Wired magazine, strained my eyes on the lightest end of the spectrum in our latest release Archer, and I handle a lot of technical/production matters (final font mastering, python tool development, etc) among other things. I feel very lucky, indeed!</p>
