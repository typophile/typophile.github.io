body: "I just heard Wim Crouwel, mastermind of many typefaces as you all well know,
  will hold the first in a new series of ISTD lectures on 3rd June at the Royal College
  of Physicians, next to Regent's Park. (great location!) \r\n\r\nHe's going to talk
  about his graphic design work, 50 years of experience and pioneering design - and
  Mr Crouwel will tell us all about his relationship with his clients. \r\n\r\nThis
  insightful talk will be accompanied by an introduction by Hamish Muir (8vo),who
  will reveal everything about working for Crouwel in his role as director of the
  Museum Boymans-van Beuningen.\r\n\r\nI had the chance to meet Wim Crouwel back in
  October during the opening of \"80 20 100\" a show of Crouwel posters at vivid gallery
  in Rotterdam - http://www.vividvormgeving.nl/page/crouwel2008.htm - which was great
  and I'm looking forward to going to this event as well. \r\n\r\nTickets are limited
  and can be purchased in advance only at http://www.istd.org.uk/wim-crouwel \r\n\r\nO
  yes, there is a complimentary drink included in the ticket price - it's the celebration
  of ISTD's 80th birthday - and one lucky winner will be given a special prize presented
  by Wim Crouwel."
