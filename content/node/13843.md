  body: "Bitstream's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/big-limbo-bt/\"
    target=\"new\">'Big Limbo' </a>is pretty similar to the first sample, and several
    of Brian Bonislawsky's fonts are in a similar vein, if close is good enough.\r\n\r\nI
    was looking in Part 14 of the Script Font ID Guide when I found that, and there
    may be better matches, but I stopped looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Bowfinpw - "Big Limbo" does look close and may work. No one has responded
    about the broken up font. I was wondering if anyone was familiar with a font called
    "crack house" I seem to remember a font with this name that was broken like the
    smapel I posted.

    target=\"_blank\">Crackhouse</a> is broken, but doesn't contain the outline that
    your font does.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
