  a rough mock-up of a web page and would like to know any things that you think could
  look better or i should include.\r\n\r\niv tried to use lots of greys and have kept
  the whole design including the logo simple, i wanted to do this because from research
  i have done with other social networking sites i have seen that they are very simple
  and get straight to the point.\r\n\r\ni would like to also know your thoughts on
  the type.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    / Myspace or professional networking like Linkedin or Behance? Or maybe something
    totally different?\r\n\r\nAt first sight everything looks too bold and dominant,
    you must be aware of different screen resolutions. Never make the layout wider
    than 960pixels and remember to keep in mind some people still run 1024*768 which
    means you have to think about the vertical space aswell. The menu can't be too
    thick, and the content need to get pushed to towards the top so users on low resolution
    will be able to see content instantly."

  body: "hey, thanks alot if you could try and pick out what type you think is a bit
    bold and dominant. the websites is meant for general networking, it will be a
    service which users sign up to use they get a profile the big thing about the
    website is the function of a big calendar which bands, charities, organizations
    etc can post upcoming events effortlessly and where public users can tick (rsvp)
    easily an event to go to.\r\n\r\ni did more designs last night they all have the
    same fonts but today, i have decided to change the font to a more easy readable
    one.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_5410.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nhere
