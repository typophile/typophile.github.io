body: 'Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>does anyone have experience with ttf fonts under Linux?
  I&#39;m rounding up a typeface with a ttf version. I had 3 different people test
  this under Windows and it works perfectly. But someone under Linux has major problems
  with it. This is what he said: <BR> <BR>- The typeface is visible, he can select
  it but there is no preview <BR>- He tried to use the font with the following results:
  <BR>    &#42; terminal program crasher irreparable <BR>    &#42; mozilla webbrowser
  renders all the texts invisible <BR> <BR>This person is running everything under
  Linux and has a substantial amount of windows ttf fonts that he runs without any
  problems. <BR> <BR>I created this font with Fontographer 4.1.5 on a Mac with OS9.2.   <BR>The
  encoding under Font Information is set to Windows. <BR> <BR>Does anyone have an
  idea what happens?  <BR> <BR>Thanx, <BR>Ren'
