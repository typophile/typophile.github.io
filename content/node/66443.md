  may be a custom font...\r\n\r\n...checked the myfonts.com font id mechanism first,
  and it turned up nothing close. \r\n\r\nLooks similar to House Fonts 'Chalet Tokyo',
  but not quite right with the 'k' and 'm' extenders.  \r\n\r\nHas anyone seen this
  type before, or have a best ballpark guesstimate? Any/all tips appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTnx,
  Dave"
