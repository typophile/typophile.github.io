  body: This Firefox 4 Beta is great. Oh wait, IE 9? People still use IE? Are they
    the same people who keep showing up at Sarah Palin rallies or something?

    but more that half of people who use the internet use IE, regardless of their
    levels of education, position on any political spectrum you choose or their views
    on shooting Bambi, so, like it or not, you can't dismiss it just because you don't

    Microsoft's new browser is as popular as the company hopes, it may reverse Internet

    running Vista SP2 or higher seems like a foolish move that is likely to inspire
    millions to find an alternative browser, such as Firefox or Chrome. This could
    further damage IE's current supremacy of the browser market. All versions of Internet
    Explorer combined currently dominate with 60.4 percent of the Web browser market.

    It might reverse as Win7 continues picks up steam and IE9 provides an experience
    comparable - or superior - to other browsers. (There are some things IE does better.
    There are.)\r\n\r\n3) There might be some user experimentation going on as a result
    of the EU decision. Just remember that old habits die hard and the blue E is always
    there to fall back on.\r\n\r\n4) Microsoft is perfectly willing to lose some browser
    market share overall. I've sensed this for a long time. I could be wrong but I
    don't think so.\r\n\r\nBecause a 30% market share gives them as much clout and
    veto power as 70% does. With much less flack, much less pressure.\r\n\r\nLosing
    some browser share is no threat. But having a browser that sucks in comparison
    to others, most definitely is.\r\n\r\nLastly, remember that they are still defining
    the environment in which other browser makers must work.\r\n\r\nThat's my take,
    FWIW.\r\n\r\nRich"

    on a 20 year old Apple box. It won't happen. Or any Phone's OS on a mobile phone
    from 2001. again, not going to happen. The kernel grows over time to accommodate
    for complex operations (and larger bit systems) therefore more computing power
    is required (and higher GHz doesn't necessarily mean more computing power.) Operating
    systems of today are built to be used by the technology of today. Why would they
    waste time optimizing a modern OS to function <em>faster</em> on something that
    an infinitesimally small amount of people would attempt?\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Why the

    of the new OS's look and functionality. That aside, what company has ever stuck
    to one look, especially in the OS world? MacOS has gone through its own evolution
    with a ride range of aesthetic differences. OSX looks great, too, but they didn't
    just pop that out of nowhere. It's been evolving for the past few decades to what
    it is today."
