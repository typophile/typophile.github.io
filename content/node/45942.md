  the formatting window shows) is Times New Roman 12pt, but the text on the screen
  and when it is printed out is so small it's almost illegible (maybe a 4pt).  Does
  anyone know what to do about this?  (Tried Font Finagler - no luck; cleaned caches
  - no luck.)\r\nI'm new at this, so if it's an easy fix, be kind!\r\n "
