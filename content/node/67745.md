  Fontographer?  My entire font needs to be enlarged by 149% to meet the publisher's
  technical requirements.  I find that I can enlarge one character at a time using
  Fontographer's Transform function, but when I select multiple characters they not
  only enlarge, but turn upside down.\r\n\r\nThere must surely be a simpler solution
  to this problem.  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nTom Lincoln\r\n"

  body: "It's been years since I've used Fontographer, but here's a trick I figured
    out way back when for scaling an entire font:\r\n\r\n(Be sure to Save first in
    case you make a mistake.)\r\n\r\n1. Choose \"Element > Font Info...\"\r\n\r\n2.
    The \"Font Info\" dialog box is displayed. There are two checkboxes near the bottom,
    \"Retain path coordinates...\" and \"Automatically compute...\". Make sure both
    of these are <strong>unchecked.</strong>\r\n\r\n3. Note the current \"Em Square:\"
    value and multiply it by your scaling amount. For example, if the Em Square value
    is 1000 and the scaling amount is 149%, then 1000 x 1.49 = 1490. Enter the calculated
    value in the \"Em Square:\" field and hit \"OK\".\r\n\r\nAt this point, the paths
    are all scaled up, but the Em Square value is wrong. So,\r\n\r\n5. Choose \"Element
    > Font Info...\"\r\n\r\n6. <strong>Check</strong> the box next to \"Retain path
    coordinates...\"\r\n\r\n7. Enter the original Em Square value (in the example
    above it would be 1000) and hit \"OK\".\r\n\r\nYour font is now scaled."

  body: "That will work, Mark, but I think there's an easier way:\r\n\r\n1. In the
    main window press Ctrl-a to mark all glyphs.\r\n2. In the menu, choose Element/transform.\r\n3.
    In the popup window choose\r\n   a) Center transformations around: Character origin\r\n
    \  b) First transformation: Scale uniformly 149 (or whatever) percent.\r\n   c)
    then: do nothing\r\n   d) click on the button \"transform\".\r\n\r\nStep 3 a)
    is important, otherwise the smaller characters will sit somewhere in mid-air if
    you choose Center of selection instead.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: The advantage of my method is that it also scales the kerning.

  body: Good point. Mine doesn't (just checked it). I think the reason that I never
    thought of that is that the fonts I scaled were in such a rough state that they
    didn't have any (proper) kerning at all.
