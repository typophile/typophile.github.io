  body: "Stefan, we often locate fonts there, and link to them, because we get many
    ID requests for things that are obviously made from amateur/freeware fonts. Dafont
    organizes their fonts by categories, and lets you set a test phrase and search
    the entire category -- one of the most useful capabilities for IDing fonts. They
    have also been very good about removing any font that you tell them is a rip-off.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Sorry, but If you ask me to be a supporter of Dafont, That will never happen.
    They used to have a rip-off of Oxtail (called Cleopatra) up before. I have to
    be quite angry before they removed it. And of course the rip-off is still around
    in other \"free-fonts sites\"...\r\n\r\nI could imagine a site with all the \"official\"
    free-fonts from respectable foundries in one place. With a clear definition of
    the usage etc. Maybe with registration etc. But to me sites like Dafont is and
    will be sites with low morale and respect for all of us that are trying to make
    a living on type design."

    or respect was probably not considered when they gave their fonts away. They just
    wanted to share. A simple innocence. \r\n\r\nThe quantity of quality fonts that
    come out as freeware isn't enough to have much impact on you, I would imagine.\r\n\r\nI
    personally thin dafont rocks! Big time. Without having to search, I can get enough
    new toys to play with that I don't miss downloading almost any commercial font
    I want, for free on the web. A sort of methadone for recovering fontaholics. \r\n"

    that it is not always just innocence. Especially here on Typophile where most
    (if not all) of us know that it is wrong. Continuing to say it is innocence is
    also, in a way, brushing it under the carpet and letting the practice continue.
    \r\n\r\nI think sites like DaFont, who have been removing fonts when they are
    told about their questionable origins, should take a stronger stance if they wish
    to ever be considered a reputable source for free fonts. Otherwise, I cannot in
    good conscious and without hesitation recommend them as I'll never be able to
    guarantee the true origins of the fonts. \r\n\r\nThe dafont links are left on
    Typophile as Stephen has said they are doing what they can to remove links when
    told to do so. "

    you don't really care how it looks then DaFont "rocks". But if you are a serious
    professional designer or typographer, looking for quality fonts with which to
    create quality designs, you are not likely to find them on DaFont or any other
    freeware site.

    misconstrue what I said. I was referring to newbie fontmakers giving their fonts
    away. If they want to do that, who's to say what their motives are? I prefer to
    believe it is a joy of sharing their work.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, I am on the
    side of the commercial fontmakers (except when they are jerks). Which is why I
    hang out here instead of where I used to hang. Unfortunately, I no longer have
    the money to buy fonts for no purpose other than to enjoy them. \r\n\r\nA few
    commercial fontmakers send me copies of their fonts (I think because I supported
    them early on), and I feature them gladly. And I make a point of referring people
    to Myfonts if they want a copy.\r\n\r\nBest wishes to all from soggy So. Cal.\r\n;

    I made a quick search for \"Cleopatra\" + \"free fonts\" and found the ugly as
    ever rip-off from my own OXTAIL on two different sites. One of them proudly stated
    it had been downloaded over 8000 times. Now I could be spending loads of time
    trying to have them removing it, but I don't think it's worth all of the effort.
