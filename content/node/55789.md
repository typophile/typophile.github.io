  easily readable at smaller ( < 14pt) sizes. Marker Felt fits the bill, though I'm
  personally not a fan. I was wondering if anyone could answer the following questions...\r\n\r\n1.
  Marker Felt comes packaged with my OS (OSX), but I can't seem to find any licensing
  information associated with it, and have found earlier versions available in numerous
  places for free / donation. Apple don't seem to offer it for sale and neither do
  any of the major internet font sellers. So how does my use of it stand? Can I use
  it for free?\r\n\r\n2. If anyone has any alternatives to Marker Felt they think
  I might prefer, I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot."

    suggestions.\r\n\r\n@sii - Will be sifr (or similar) and maybe a graphic or two.
    Are you thinking the embedding will be a liscencing issue?\r\n\r\n@aluminium -
    Felt Tip is nice, but a little bit too scribbly for my purposes. It needs to be
    clean and consistant. Problem is that most of the handwritten fonts I've looked
    at are a little bit too handwritten (I know that probably sounds absurd)."

    - last time I checked they don't have a font specific section in their EULA -
    I would say that web graphics are fine, sifr may be borderline. You could always
    try asking them.   \r\n"

  body: "@ B3N \r\n\r\nThanks for those. Nice, but as you said, not really handwritten.\r\n\r\n@
    eliason \r\n\r\nI like that a lot. Especially at a smaller size.\r\n\r\n@ sii
    \r\n\r\nEmailed them and got no response. Contacted the guy who designed it and
    got no response from him either.\r\n\r\n@ lauren d. \r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions.
    I think Graphite has too much modulation. Compur is kind of close but caps only."
