  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hey everybody,

I'm designing a logo for 'perron 20'. This is dutch for platform 20. They advise addicts about financial and social things by people who have been addicts themselves. 'Wij leven met je mee' means something like 'We feel empathy for you'. Keywords: professional, positive, open and warm. I used Livory by HVD fonts because it seems to radiate warmth and comfort. I like the look of it, but I think it needs an icon to symbolize what they do. Any commends are welcome! I've thought about something with a train or platform for an icon, but that's not what I'm looking for.

Thanks for your help,

Jasper de Waard

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not sure about that 'p' opening with the gap; it tends to be a saccation (stopping eye movement) with that gap from the stem. And '20' is way too tight in that circle, and they seem too thin. Does that font have lower case numbers?

Apart from those, the overall look is friendly and inviting.</div>

The Livory serif is handsome, but it still seems a bit aloof to me for something that is supposed to be inviting and familiar. Have you looked at sans?

Orange is a nice choice, too. But Orozco's idea is quite smart and could make a good case with the client. I don't mind the circle, but it certainly isn't doing much for balance.

Just a couple of thoughts...take them for a grain of salt.</div>

I'd argue that <i>most people</i> in Holland aren't your audience. Recovering addicts in Holland are your audience, and they are also your clients. I don't know anything about addiction treatment in Holland, but in Germany there's even a song by an artist called Blossom (Blümchen), "Pink Cloud" ("Rosa Wolke," a bad little techno number, but the lyrics seem pretty clearly about the addiction recovery denial phenomenon to me, in either tongue).

You seem to know what you want, and I applaud that, but I'd still tell you the same. Livory is a handsome oldstyle face. But the invitation it sends to me is one from authority, rather than from a peer. Just things to consider. There are messages in our fonts...!

Good luck with the client!</div>

Yes, I agree. I've been looking at this a few times and while it does look nice, the «tone» seems slightly off for the audience and situation you're communicating in. Consider that communication doesn't only involve <em>what</em> is being said and <em>how</em> the tone/voice feels to yourself, but there's also the question of <em>who</em> is speaking to <em>whom</em> (and how those people are made to feel). In the situation you describe, I'd also expect something that communicates more from peer to peer. Livory is beautiful, but it does evoke the old age of book wisdom, a printed æsthetic, where knowledge – and help – was a much more hierarchical and authoritarian affair. This tone of «authority» is one you would exactly want to avoid, I guess – it might feel ever so slightly patronizing (I'm assuming your target audience might be very sensitive to how their situation is presented or referred to). You need something that communicates at eye level; something that's fresher and straighter without being cold, something honest and strong, not this artistic/«bookish» and soft. Warmth is good, but not condescending warmth – warmth at eye level.

On a more «surface» level, one thing that makes me find Livory a wrong choice in this context is that if you look at the actual shapes of the characters, it seems sad rather than strong. There are a lot of «frowning» shapes. The top-left instrokes of the "p", "n", and "r" all droop down. The opening of the "p" also makes it look sad to me. The overall softness (which looks eroded, like something was washed away) says everything <em>but</em> freshness, strength, youth, and being able to rebound from something that's as hard to overcome as addiction.

In case I sound harsh: I like the font too, but I'm trying to look past my own taste and think into what it needs to communicate in this case, and I think it's miscast, like a good actor in the wrong role. 

BTW, what's with the railway metaphor? Is that important to the client, should it be played off? (You don't need to draw a train icon, but maybe use a font that could be used in railway signage or something?)</div>

Don't be afraid to go back to the drawing board. It's quite a complicated organisation to sum up in a logo. For this reason I think your interpretation of warmth and approachability is appropriate. Now you must choose how to communicate these ideas. Beyond emotive choices it is a graphic exercise, weight, proportion, relationship, essentially creating a kind of neatness or harmony.

Consider the regular demands of a logo; must work at different scales, possibly in black only.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd suggest that it looks too formal for what the organisation does... it speaks to me of financial planning, but it doesn't fit well with the intended audience.
