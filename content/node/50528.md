  has me stumped. \r\n\r\nI'm modifying an Indesign file that was made in Europe (I'm
  not sure which country but non English speaking) and my spell check isn't working
  now. Simple words like file, spell, word aren't coming through as spelled correctly
  even though I have my dictionary as USA English. \r\n\r\nAny idea what's going on? "
