  tips from this forum for the past year now and I feel that I'm coming to the right
  place for help here. \r\nIt's my 1st post and I desperately need help in redesigning
  a company's stationery set. \r\n\r\nHere they have a logo which unfortunately are
  against the idea of a new concept but what they require is a complete revamp of
  their stationery. \r\nI'm trying to give them a \"wallpaper\" look . Strong images
  accompanied with a clean layout. meaning to say lots of breathing space. \r\nI just
  can't for the life of me figure out what font would suit it best. \r\n\r\nI've tried
  going with the norm of sans for headers and serif for body copy but it just doesn't
  suit it for some reason. So far the best that works for me is segoe light(free font)
  and frutiger/myriad. Here's what I have so far. Would appreciate any critique or
  any suggestions for matching fonts. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/egmes_6540.jpg]"

  body: Sorry forgot to include that my clients really want a fresh look.. They're
    land developers so their stuff needs to be totally corporate but now infused with
    something a bit more modern which compliments their grotesk logo. Somewhere along
    the lines of Apple. Anyone know what fonts apple uses besides myriad anyways?

  body: "Well, one way would be to not have a serif at all and create hierarchy by
    using different weights and versions of the same sans. Sharon suggests a great
    option with Apex. The new featured face Clan may also work for you; as would some
    of the [[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl|DTL]] faces like Argo and Prokyon.\r\n\r\nThe
    other safe way would be to look at some of the supefamilies like Quadraat or Fedra
    that have sans and serifs in a wide range of weights and variants. [[http://typophile.com/node/39833?|This
    list]] may be helpful. \r\n     \r\nAnd if it's just a serif that you're looking
    for to match with Myriad/Frutiger, [[http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns08.html|Swift]]
    should work real well."

  body: "Hey thanks. Apex looks real sweet. I'll try convincing my clients to stretch
    a lil more on the budget to get it but for now I think I'm stuck with segoe. Gonna
    take writingdesigning's suggestion on the weights. So far it's looking ok with
    dialog light. Looks a lot like myriad except for a few characters, the loops are
    open, not closed. \r\nWould have used myriad itself but I think it's getting a
    bit too over-used. \r\n\r\nThanks for the tips! I'll drop a preview of the next
    draft soon. "
