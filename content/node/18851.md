  pretty much finished with a typeface. Everything works fine in Adobe, but when I
  try using it in word, or previewing it in character map, I get what you see below.
  (just square boxes where there should be characters) I am pretty sure it has to
  do with the unicode encoding. What am I doing wrong? Thanks for any help you may
  provide.\r\n\r\nI am using Fontlab 5 and windows XP."
