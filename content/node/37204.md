  deficit disorder and their families. The design was remarkable\u2014it was extremely
  attractive and attention-getting visually, but had a well-developed\u2014and followed\u2014hierarchy
  that was clearly designed to make it easy on readers with ADD. This got me wondering\u2014are
  there more magazines out there <em>designed</em> for readers with visual, reading,
  or learning disabilities?"

    here (I saw it in a waiting room and couldn\u2019t take it), but our magazine
    offerings are weird in DC. Chris, you might have more luck out there in Reston
    where there are a lot of people with kids. \r\n\r\nWe should get the designers
    to speak at Typecon next year. Of course, this all assumes that they actually
    design the magazine with ADD in mind, and that they don\u2019t just handle hierarchies
    especially well."

    the visually/hearing impaired: you might also want to check out the mag shelves
    at Gallaudet, which should have a range for you to investigate....\r\n\r\nIn doing
    my Masters, it was pretty obvious that when one sense was atrophied, others took
    over: folks who were hearing-impaired needed more obvious visual clues, and the
    visual-impaired needed both aural and touch-sensitive materials."

    And I have to find me a copy of that magazine. Oh, look over there!

  body: "I've got a profound hearing loss and therefore have a disability. I've got
    no issues with the word \"disability\". However if people asked me the question,
    \"are you disabled\", I'd simply answer \"no\" purely for political or social
    reasons. There are people who equate disability with \"crippled\" or someone with
    an inability to achieve anything substantial at all. This is a complete nonsense.
    A disability is simply an obstacle in life, if you can't hear, see, taste, feel
    or walk, you gotta work around the problem like anything else, that's all. It's
    disappointing sometimes how people perceive disabilities but it's improving all
    the time with increased understanding and also support for braille, captioning
    etc.\r\n\r\nI'm all for magazines about disabilities."

  body: "I'm not against the term disability, but the problem I have with it is that
    it focuses on people with 'lesser' ability rather than focusing on the fact that
    people, in general, are all different. I prefer terms like 'universal design'
    as it is more inclusive of all people rather then exclusive.\r\n\r\nBut, that's
    just me. No biggie either way.\r\n"

    have all sorts of tools to help the disable learn. My stepson is legally blind
    and during his time at school, the Lighthouse was fantastic. Getting him schoolbooks
    in large type, on records (yep in those days it was still record albums) helping
    where they could. It's a wonderful organization - and extremely helpful. They
    were located on 58th or 59th Street - and are probably still there plugging away.
    It's been years since I've been in touch with them."
