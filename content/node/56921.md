  body: "It looks like Belizio has a small notch near the tail of the y that the sample
    doesn't have. I think Marc is right about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/clarendon/|Clarendon]].
    The bold or heavy weights are both quite close to the sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    as a generic answer. :)\r\nCheers!"

  body: You were on the right track, David. My "Clarendon" was a lazy way to ID the
    font without actually digging to find the exact make and model. :)
