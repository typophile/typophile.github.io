  national team soccer jerseys. \r\n\r\nThe typeface used for writing NARODNA BANKA
  SRBIJE is an ellegant serif font but its serifs are very much reduced. It reminds
  a little bit of roman capital letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/serbia-yugoslavia-50-dinara-2005-pnew-wpmm_3802.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5000_front_6678.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/200rsd-front_4410.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank

  body: If anyone recognizes the sans-serif it would be great. If not, help with Optima
    is more than enough!

  body: Are you thinking of the one that says "pet hiljada dinara" on the 5000-dinar
    note? That's Helvetica. The numbers are set in something else entirely, though.
