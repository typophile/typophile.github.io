  certain the \"Seaside\" is hand-drawn, so I'm already retracing that in Illustrator;
  however, I'm sure I've seen the font used for \"Sanitation\" somewhere before, but
  darned if I can place it right now. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nOh, and if anyone could ID
  \"Commercial, Residential, Industrial\" as well, I'd be tickled pink."
