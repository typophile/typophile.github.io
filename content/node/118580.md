  body: "There may be something closer, and the logo may be an edited version of the
    letters in a font, but its difficult to spot differences with this font [img:sites/default/files/old-images/DeVinneTextInUse_3441.gif]\r\nDe
    Vinne Text by Bitstream. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/\r\nA
    revival of a font cut by  Gustav F. Schroeder for the Bruce Type Foundry circa
    1890 and sold by Bruce under the memorable name of \"No. 11.\" The digital De
    Vinne is a completely different design from the fonts sold by most foundries under
    the name De Vinne from the 1890s onwards.\r\nNote the hairline serifs in the Modern
    style of Didot and Bodoni. \r\nClose alternatives include the Scotch Roman designs
    available as Benton Modern Display Regular and Semi Bold \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BentonModDispInUse_3705.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/BentonModDispSemiBoldInUse_4626.gif]\r\nand
