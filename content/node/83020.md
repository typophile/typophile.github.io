body: 'Hello, i received an old vision acuity test (wecker''s) that i need to receate.
  The problem is that i can''t identify the font.. I''n made some research but i don''t
  find it... It''s similar to Memphis and Kaine from Linotype but they''re not enough
  as I really want to make it like the original. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in
  advance '

    of the B and R etc. which look amateurish as style is not a factor in its creation.\r\nDo
    you just need the letters on the model? I suggest you just create the letters
    you need from scratch. "
