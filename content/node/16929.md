body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Point</strong>\r\n\r\nA standard typographic
  unit of measure equal to exactly 1/72nd of an inch (1/12 [[pica]]). \r\n\r\nPrior
  to the advent of [[postscript]] the typographic point (Anglo-American) was only
  roughly 1/72 of an inch. Prior attempts to standardize the typographic point were
  put forth by [[Pierre Simon Fournier]], [[Francoise-Ambroise Didot]] and [[Morris
  Fuller Benton]] which resulted in a split standard between the European Didot point
  and the Anglo-American point."
