  this new CD? it looks so much like a cut of Baskerville to me, but i can&#39;t match
  it.. <BR> <BR>also, i can&#39;t find a picture of it and can&#39;t scan anything
  right now, but the liner notes for this CD contains one of the most beautiful double
  daggers i have ever encountered.. [it is ..er.. twisted? in the middle.. it looks
  like a combination of... the Option-6 symbol [?] and a double dagger] if anyone
  could tell me what font it is, that would be awesome.. i&#39;ll post a picture of
  it when i get a chance, but for now:  <BR> <BR>?? <BR> <BR>thanks in advance <IMG

  body: I&#39;m suprised to see Mrs. Eaves on a Radiohead album. Their <BR>previous
    releases combined Yorke&#39;s art with unexpected  <BR>typography. They took chances
    and tried something new.  <BR>Mrs. Eaves is more of an easy bet - pretty, but
    overused. <BR> <BR>The painting is wonderful, though.

    of that diesis.. i guess i didn&#39;t check all the sets well enough? sorry..  <BR>
    <BR>and i&#39;ve always been completely drawn to the artwork on the radiohead
    albums..  <BR> <BR>thank you so much.. you just made my night

  body: Radiohead actually credits Emigre in the liner notes, if you read &#39;em
    closely. I _love_ the city grid/words painting as well, but Mrs Eaves seems like
    such a trite choice for this album because it&#39;s so ubiquitous. <BR> <BR>Then
    again, it&#39;s still lightyears ahead of the typography on some of their early
    albums like The Bends &#40;their best, IMO&#41;. <BR> <BR>C
