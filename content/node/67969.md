    it runs an end-of-life dog shelter in a small town, i.e., a place where terminally
    ill animals can receive a humane end. You make it sound like they shovel them
    into ovens. Newkirk has explained this at length, but people like you trot it
    out all the time as if it exposes deep-seated hypocrisy and deception.\r\n\r\nHow\u2019s
    them fonts goin\u2019, Cerulean?"

    flame-baiting, which, if you want to do, you're going to have to be a lot more
    subtle.

    are as I described them. PETA is not a secret front for animal genocide. Now,
    what do you think of the reassociation of blackletter type with the Nazis? Lots
    for you to plunder there if you\u2019re rabidly anti-PETA. Were you rabid, though,
    I suppose we\u2019d put you down. Best for everybody."

    associations, and it is the qualifier, in this case a toothbrush 'tache and the
    text, that determines what it's going to be.\r\n\r\nYou would find that out in
    a hurry if you attempt some kind of nasty fascist blackletter vibe in a page design,
    but it ends up looking more like a Christmas card. \r\n\r\nIMO the type in the
    PETA ad is a little too rotunda for the message."

    fascism! Dang!</cite>\r\n\r\nDream on, Joe. :o) \r\nThat one will not die in our
    lifetimes.\r\n\r\nIn the tiny pantheon of broad typeface categories, recognizable
    by the average person with no particular knowledge of typography\u2014those non-designers
    who make up literally all of a designer's actual audience; <cite>serif, sans serif,
    blackletter </cite>(most commonly referred to by non-designers as \"gothic\" or
    \"old English\"), <cite>script </cite>and <cite>\"fancy\"</cite>, there really
    isn't a case for any one of them to be considered to be emblematic of anything
    ideological.  Never the less, that is the sad lot of blackletter. We know it's
    wrong, but that's just the way it is.\r\n\r\nThese \"categories\" are too big
    to be forced into small boxes and their number is too small to get very far with
    that sort of ideological categorization. I.e., calling blackletter a<cite>Nazi</cite>
    font, or <cite>non Nazi</cite> font. But it's hard to avoid if somehow the whole
    category managed to pick up some heavy baggage somewhere along the way. The facts
    don't necessarily matter to any but a few and there's not much to be done about
    that. (education? Women have been trying to teach men to put toilet seats down
    for a while now, and we all know how that's going, don't we? :o)\r\n\r\nThere
    are often be contextual references to cultural, historic or social assumptions
    and baggage associated with any part of a design element. Red says \"danger\",
    (except when it doesn't). Yellow says \"caution\", (except, when it doesn't).
    Type that looks like melting wax will always say \"hippie\" and \"1960's\". Type
    that is a bit wonky, looks like it is could be made out of banana leaves or has
    zig-zaggy  patterns in it says \"Africa\". And there are enough people who, rightly
    or wrongly, associate blackletter with Nazism that it is too effective a way of
    not so subtly telegraphing \"evil Nazi\" in a way that no other style of type
    can, for designers not to use it in that way (Well, some designers). Even so,
    without the comb and the dogie bangs the association isn't there in the ad. It's
    just a cute dog with \"fancy\" \"olde English\" letters above it. If it was an
    ad for pretty white pure-bred doglets, with no comb mustachio and no dogie Hitler-bangs,
    people would read something entirely different into the choice of font. Context
    rules, because at the same time people associate blackletter with Nazis, they
    also associate it equally with knights in shining armour, Friar Tuck, the Bible,
    street gangs, ye olde Germany, funeral parlours, a certain brand of potato chips
    and fancy monograms. \r\n"
