body: "Looking for a source to purchase Condact by Dimitris Perdikopoulos, or suggestions
  for a similar font. It looks like it was on Ten Dollar Fonts at some point, but
  the links to purchase seem to have been removed. I've really been looking for a
  set of numerals with a 3 like contained in Condact, but also love the rest of the
  Condact design. I found it on Behance. Here's the link:\r\n[[https://www.behance.net/gallery/3702706/Condact-Typeface|https://www.behance.net/gallery/3702706/Condact-Typeface]]"

  body: "Great suggestions. Thank you!\r\n\r\nAnd Fvilanakis, I've been hesitant to
    join Behance just to send a message, but will probably do so. Good stuff happening
    in Athens; must be something in the water."
