		<div class="commentbody">Nick, <BR> <BR>You raise a very good point! My quiz sheet is a scribbly mess, the epicenter of which lies on that very question. With regard to Bell, I first dated my answer to that of John Bell's specimens; then I recalled, just as you have written, that &quot;Bell&quot; wasn't released by that name until 1930 by Monotype, and so I changed my answer. In a moment of blind panic combined with nightmarish PSAT recall (&quot;your first answer is usually the right one&quot; &ndash; whatever the hell that means), I changed my answer back. <BR> <BR>That question was indeed make-or-break, and I just happened to get fairly lucky.  <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">With regards to the ordering of fonts, the stated rules were that one was supposed to use the date of the original design, not the revival. Of course, on that basis the quizmasters goofed in marking Interstate as 1993. As Nick says, they were inconsistent. But they did say how it was supposed to work. (Of course, it was a pretty noisy environment, so it's not a shock that Nick didn't hear this rule being explained.) <BR> <BR>I *think* I would have gotten three more points had this question been marked correctly. But that would only have tied me with Kent for second, and who knows how many other folks would also have gotten more points&hellip;. <BR> <BR>Oh well! I think this just goes to show that we shouldn't take it too seriously. <BR> <BR>Oh yeah, there *were* a bunch of repeat questions from previous years' quizzes.

Didn't Mark and Stephen <BR>have 35 or 36? <BR> <BR>Changing the &quot;correct&quot; order might have <BR>had some Impact on Mark and Stephen <BR>and you could've moved up. <BR> <BR>However, lots of others had scores in the <BR>low 30s, too. <BR> <BR>There was a group in front that shared <BR>answers <i>shhhh.</i> and they finished with 32, I think. <BR> <BR>Keith Tam had a 32, too. <BR> <BR>So I don't think you were robbed, per se. <BR> <BR>In fact, you didn't seem all that bothered <BR>once the dance floor opened for business. <BR> <BR>Way to bust a move, man! <BR> <BR>And for the record, there were two correct <BR>answers on the David Carson question. <BR>Carson wasn't just a regular joe surfer,  <BR>but a Professional Surfer, ranked as high as <BR>eighth in the world. (And a sociology teacher.) <BR> <BR>So I'll take my 32 and know that I was only <BR>a few away from some of the Type ID linchpins.  <BR>There's always next year. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR> <BR>for the record, Jon scored a 42, pretty <BR>much snapping the serifs off our collective stems,  <BR>with luck playing absolutely no role. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>
