		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments, my partner felt that the 2nd logo looked somewhat dated, which isn't exactly what we're going for the 3rd one is definatly more fun feeling but still isn't quite what we were looking for, the 1st one is remenicent of another logotype for a company that i can't put my finger on, i'm not entirely sure about a serifed typeface for the monogram, as it stands it really makes me think of some sort of roman alphabet chop mark. i'm somewhat at a loss about how to integrate the whole name with it effectivly</div>

If you must put the name next to the box, give it some space - some poise - and put it on one line if possible. Then you can use the logo with and without the logotype. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">by the way, i'm jared's &quot;business partner&quot; as he mentioned in the first post.  I'm the one who did the first fairhouse logo, knocked out on a black rectangle, and i also did the silos thing.  those silo ones were done pretty quick and were meant to just throw out more possibilities.  and yes i stretched the typeface on that first one (which i dont normally do, but i thought Geneva was just too common of a font and had to be changed, and the computer i was on didn't have all the fonts in the world) <BR> <BR>anyway, i really appreciate all the visual modifications everyone has done, and even the sketches which were not based off of the first post at all&hellip; it's great that everyone is really thinking and helping. <BR> <BR>i think we've got to do something different here.  i don't know where this is all going, but i hope it stops in a good place.  now here's another idea i threw together today&hellip;it's intended to be just a mark;  a logotype could go next to it, or under it, or inside it&hellip; please tell me what you think of it&hellip; thanks <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13790.gif" alt="ffff logo"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is an interesting direction. What do you think of softening it to something of a pinwheel shape? The squareness at the center is reminiscent of a swastika (This may be just me). You might try breaking the circuit to alleviate this feeling as well. <BR> <BR>In any case, in my tinkering I came up with an interesting, and I believe more pleasing alternate. What if you extend both the ascending and descending small tips flush with the tops of the f's, delete the left and right tips. and break the box into an F character and an H. (note you will also need to extend the hook of the f.) The result is an FH melded into a pinwheel. <BR> <BR>I hope this makes sense.  <BR> <BR>Andrew</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ignacio's (halfway up the thread) is very good, as far as working with your original monograms. <BR> <BR>However, you may be putting the cart before the horse. There are a million ways of combining F, H, and D. What you need to do first is identify the look and feel you want, because this will characterize your company. <BR> <BR>Do you want an edgy, techy &quot;new media&quot; look? Would you like a clean, European feel? A muted, subdued, professional look? Do you want to portray energy or steadfastness? Fun or seriousness? Cheap or expensive? Common or elite?
