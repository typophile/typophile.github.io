  logo uses Edwardian Script ITC\r\nI used Adobe Garamond Pro for a headline and it
  looks (goes together) okay but I would like to know if there is a better go-together?
  \ Continuing with Edwardian Script ITC doesn't seem like a good idea (too fancy).\r\n\r\nAlso,
  for website copy, I need to select a default, would you use Verdana or ?\r\n\r\nYour
  guidance will be appreciated.\r\nLinK"
