  editing mode which I find very interesting. <BR> <BR>What are these groups? Please,
  post here your suggestions. One that comes to mind is &#34;COGQ&#34; but I&#39;d
  like to know more of them. <BR> <BR>Are these groups &#34;absolute&#34; or there
  are different combinations for different types of font?

  body: 'This is a very interesting topic to me, and gets addressed once in a while
    in the literature. <BR>Tracy&#39;s &#34;Letters of Credit&#34; gives these groups:
    <BR> <BR>With a straight upright stroke: <BR>BDEFHIJKLMNPRU bdhijklmnpqru <BR>With
    a round stroke: <BR>CDGOPQ bcdeopq <BR>Triangular: <BR>AVWXY vwxy <BR>Odd: <BR>STZ
    afgstz <BR> <BR>The first thing you&#39;ll notice is that some letters &#40;like
    &#34;P&#34;&#41; go in more than one group. This makes sense of course, and leads
    me to think that more than groups, what you&#39;re looking to categorize are base
    components, and each letter would have a list of components it uses. The tricky
    thing here I guess is deciding how detailed to go in the choosing of base components;
    since the forms of letters are defined very carefully, and deviate gently depending
    on many things &#40;like the heads of the &#34;B&#34;, &#34;P&#34; and &#34;R&#34;
    are generally different&#41;, it will be hard to come up with a list that&#39;s
    both useful and accurate. <BR> <BR>The other thing is that the applicability of
    such grouping depends a lot on the &#34;style&#34; of the face - like the &#34;M&#34;
    could have straight stems in a Modern, but splayed stems in an Old-Style. So typeface
    categories can help here - the grouping can be different for each category. But
    this isn&#39;t so clear itself... <BR> <BR>So really, grouping can only serve
    as a basis, and it will almost always need exceptions for a given font. This might
    mean it wouldn&#39;t be a <i>huge</i> help to a designer, and might in fact encourage
    modularity - which I think we have too much of already! But it can sometimes help,
    and it&#39;s a definite plus in <i>comparing</i> the glyphs in a font, as opposed
    to helping designers copy-paste quickly. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'I asked because I just added this feature to FL so it is time to fill it
    with some group data.   <BR> <BR>Shape group should be small, not more than 5
    glyphs or it will take too much resources to draw. <BR> <BR>I tried to combine
    &#34;bdpq&#34; in the group, doesn&#39;t work well to me, looks that it is better
    to split it to &#34;bp&#34; and &#34;dq&#34; pairs maybe adding &#39;o&#39; to
    both for visial balance. Also I don&#39;t think that &#34;AV&#34; is a good combination
    for &#34;V&#34; which works better in &#34;VWY&#34; group. However, &#39;V&#39;
    is a good companion for &#39;A&#39; which doesn&#39;t have other friends. <BR>
    <BR>Let me explain how it works now: you list groups in some text file which FL
    loads on startup. When feature is active and it finds that glyph selected for
    editing is a member of a group, it will show other glyphs from that group in background
    on top of each other.  <BR> <BR>Other idea that is close to this is &#34;neighbours&#34;:
    one or two glyphs that appear on left and right sides of the glyph selected for
    editing, like &#34;Hao&#34; where you only can edit &#39;a&#39; but see &#39;H&#39;
    and &#39;o&#39; all time. It will be nice to have list of these triples for all
    top ASCII characters.  <BR> <BR>In short: what glyphs you want to see on left
    and right sides of every single glyph in 33-127 range?'

    <BR> <BR>&#62; &#34;bdpq&#34; <BR> <BR>I think you might need subgroups, and/or
    an easy way for users to choose to turn members of a group on/off. For example,
    when making a &#34;d&#34;, it might be nice to have just &#34;q&#34; and &#34;o&#34;
    showing. <BR> <BR>&#62; &#39;A&#39; which doesn&#39;t have other friends.  <BR>
    <BR>Yeah, probably because he always wants to be first. <BR> <BR>&#62; one or
    two glyphs that appear on left and right sides <BR> <BR>This might actually work

    <BR> <BR>Yuri, if you can&#39;t do this all in-house, do you have a budget for
    this task? :-&#41; <BR>Because it can get pretty complex, I think. Like that chart

    it years ago! I made very simple list of &#34;triples&#34; for &#34;A-z&#34; and

  body: Yuri, this is very interesting.  <BR> <BR>If the neighbors concept is meant
    to provide similar shapes for comparison, then I don&#39;t think kerning is important
    or necessary. I don&#39;t see this feature as a spacing feature, but only as a
    shaping comparison feature. <BR> <BR>I use something like what you&#39;re working
    on in my workflow, but manually; however, what I do is sort of a cross between
    the two. I rarely stack the similar forms &#40;too busy and confusing&#41;. Instead
    I arrange them, sort of like your neighbors, in a row at equal intervals in a
    mask layer &#40;well, actually, in Fog the template layer&#41; and keep moving
    them back and forth into position behind the current outline so that I can compare
    the glyph I&#39;m working on first with one and then another. <BR> <BR>For instance,
    while I&#39;m working on G, the template/mask layer may contain C and O. I can
    then keep switching first the C and then the O into position, to compare things
    like width, curve, top serif. I may also  keep making copies of my G and transferring
    them back into the comparison row, to save iterations and move them in and out
    of position for comparison.  <BR> <BR>This is my version of &#34;onionskinning&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>For some glyphs, there may be long rows of comparisons and iterations
    stored in the template/mask layer. <BR> <BR>One thing I appreciate &#40;and rely
    heavily upon&#41; in Fog is that it keeps the undo memory for each layer &#40;and
    glyph&#41; separate, so that even after several actions in the Outline layer,
    I can go back to the Template and command-z, command-y to toggle the C and O movement
    back and forth into position. This will still work even if I&#39;ve worked in
    other glyphs for a while. When I return to a previous glyph and go to the template
    layer, my last actions are still retained in undo memory. I don&#39;t think FLab
    can do this in the Mask layer. Someone can correct me if I&#39;m wrong. <BR> <BR>The
    key shortcuts for performing these actions of copying various characters and pasting
    into the Fog template and switching back and forth between layers and moving them
    into and out of position are ingrained in my fingers and it&#39;s just like breathing
    now. I haven&#39;t trained my subconscious to do this as easily in FLab &#40;as
    I recall, the key commands are more complex, and it involves mousing to activate
    the Move input in a palette, which interrupts my flow&#41;. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: 'Yes, &#34;neighbors&#34; seems to make more sense than overlays here. What
    about this: when you open the window it starts with the neighbors arranged laterally,
    but you can click&amp;drag them sideways, putting them underneath if desired.
    <BR> <BR>Kerning: I agree with Kent that it&#39;s not necessary, <i>unless</i>
    it might be worth it to combine many editing abilities into one window: point
    editing, neighbor viewing, spacing, etc. But it might get too confusing. <BR>

    editing which will not yet be implemented in the next FontLab. However it is on

    new feature perfect. <BR> <BR>Hrant:  <BR>I will think about making an option
    to shift glyphs in the shape group by some fixed amount, but I will not allow
    to manually position them, at least not in the next update. <BR> <BR>I tried to
    support kerning in neighbours. It just looks better, but it also makes spacing
    editing more difficult to preview. It means that kerning for neighbours will be
    optional and Preferences panel will add new page :-&#41;'

    an important thing to include, especially for instance when working on a connecting
    script. The adjacent glyphs would not need to be editable, just visible either
    in preview or outline. This could simply be an optional layer in the glyph editing
