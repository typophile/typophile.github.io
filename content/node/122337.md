  typeface, I've used it, but I cannot remember the name of it and it's killing me!\r\nThe
  Js, Fs and Es are quite narrow, and there's a distinctive G.\r\nHopefully this is
  a simple ID for someone with better typeface ID expertise than me. Thanks in advance."

    the ampersand appears to be from Calibre:\r\nhttps://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/calibre/\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of the text is rather small and low-res, but perhaps Platform has a sufficiently
    narrow |J|:\r\nhttps://commercialtype.com/typefaces/platform"

  body: "Hmm, yes, I thought of all of those \u2014 but I thought it was all one typeface.
    Now I see that the W in the smaller typeface is very different and the ampersand
    too. \r\nDefinitely looks like Neutraface for the Will and Co. It's that smaller
    face I can't figure out. Thank you!"
