  body: "what I like:\r\n- white space, correlates conceptually with outer space\r\n-
    the upside/down, reverse idea in the titles\r\n- mrs eaves for main text\r\n\r\nrecommendations:\r\n-
    too much white space, it gets to boring all along, try to alternate it with full/half
    size color/photo pages (or clipped elements)\r\n- the elements on most of the
    spreads look cluttered, try to compose them in groups, and handle them consequently
    (for example the chapter titles are not on the same height)\r\n- that the title
    on spread 55/56 is crossing the photograph in an unelegant manner\r\n- mix of
    justified and unjustified setting in the main text, try to handle the main text
    only in one form of setting\r\n- mix of main text sizes, try to get along only
    with one size, same for paragraph length\r\n- mrs eaves for the titles, maybe
    you can find another font for the titles, which could be more related to ufos/outer
    space etc. ( maybe a sans serif with a slightly technic/constructed character)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
