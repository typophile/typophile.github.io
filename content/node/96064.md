body: I've narrowed my business logo down to 3 favorites. I'd like some critique.
  Favorite and why; colors complementary, too dark/too light; kerning too tight/loose;
  design element too much/dark/light; design element size; so, basically anything
  I need to do that would make it better, etc. Be brutal, but constructive. Thanks
  so much :)

    \u201CPHOTOGRAPHY & DESIGN STUDIO\u201D as the byline (with the same length of
    \ \u201Cfocus of grace\u201D)."

  body: "Whenever a logotype consists of a string of multiple words, all the same
    size, style and color, it runs the danger of looking a little dull. Is there some
    way to have more of a focal point? \r\n\r\nThe dot/dots over the \"i\" are maybe
    a step in that direction, but they are pretty subtle and I don't think that \"studio\"
    is the word that should be emphasized anyway. And the word \"of\" is the least
    important word and perhaps should be made less prominent.\r\n\r\nRiccard0's suggestion
    might be a good approach too.\r\n"

  body: Thanks for your comments. My registered company name and domain name is, however,
    focus of grace studio, would that cause confusion or not if I truncated the logo?

  body: "No problem with the domain name. And, as long you also spell it as registered
    in any legal document, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem. An alternative would
    be keeping just the \u201Cstudio\u201D as part of the logo proper, and add the
    \u201Cphotography & design\u201D were appropriate, depending on the context."

  body: "You have posted an image with a transparent background it seems. For me the
    background appears black on one system and white on another - of course giving
    a totally different look.\r\n\r\nI think the above comments are right on. Drop
    the subtitle, it shouldn't be part of the logo. Then let studio be secondary in
    hierarchy. The details of the lettering need some help too. The /u sticks out
    as strangely shaped compared to the strict geometry of the rest. The overly tall
    /f, /f, and /d are not working for me. They are too exaggerated and lack a refined
    balance that I would value in design and photography work. The watermark in the
    background is just cluttering things, and not adding anything. Maybe either go
    back to sketching and ideation if you have a solid brief, or consider consulting
    with a branding expert (i.e. hire a logo designer). The film strip is just too
    obvious for photography. Good luck!"

  body: "Thank you luma I appreciate your comments. And I'm going back to the drawing
    board. And after I asked the question, I went, duh, stupid question. I do it all
    the time. I do logo design, but for some reason I'm having mind block and doing
    stupid things on my personal logo. That's why I posted it here just to get this
    type of feed back. I'm forgetting all the rules of design it seems because it's
    personal and I'm panicking trying to get something put together and not finding
    what I want and like which is something clean, unique, simple, yet elegant. I've
    been doing non-profit/volunteer work for ages and now that I'm setting up something
    where I'm getting paid, everything I know is going out the window.\r\n\r\nSo thank
    you. I needed to hear the comments so I'd get my head back in the game where it
    needs to be and stop forcing it to work. I've been working on it in-between photo
    edits & other design work and so I'm behind which adds to the pressure. So, I'm
    just going to take my time and do it right and start all over for the bazillionth
    time :).\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: OH, thanks for the link riccard0, just what I need :) Yep, self-branding makes
    me feel stupid and incompetent, while I'm making logos for others made one woman
    cry she liked it so much... go figure! Must be over-right-braining :)
