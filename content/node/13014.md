body: "100 Hackford Road, London SW9 0QU\r\n\r\nHoldings include a large amount a
  material from the Stephenson Blake and Co., Wood type from Robert DeLittle, York
  and hot metal from the Monotype Corporation as well as the working papers of Walter
  Tracy.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typemuseum.org/index.htm\r\n\r\nIn May 2006 this Museum
  was closed due to lack of funding. A campaign and supporting Type Museum Society
  has been launched which you are invited to join.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typemuseumsociety.org/\r\n\r\nJuly
  2008 After two years of closure and no public discussion the NMSI has apparently
  proposed a plan to the trustees to put some or all of the Type Museum's collections
  into storage at the NMSI facility at Wroughton in Wiltshire. Supporters of the museum
  are campaigning against this in the belief that this will spell the end of hopes
  for a full development of the educational potential of this incomparable type collection.\r\n\r\nSue
  Shaw (a Museum Trustee, the Founder and first Director) launched a petition and
  \ comments in a local newsletter article downloadable from http://www.stockwellpark.com/pdf/spark-2008-05.pdf\r\n\r\nIn
  addition there are two online petitions running against these developments please
  support them both:\r\n\r\nOn the Number 10 website:\r\n\r\n    http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/typemuseum/\r\n\r\n\"We
  the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to stop the\r\n    proposed move into
  storage of the Type Archive, from its\r\n    present home at the Type Museum, London\r\n\r\nThe
  Type Museum has successfuly collected a large proportion of\r\n    all the definitive
  historical materials relating to the art,\r\n    design & manufacturing production
  in Britain of the typefaces\r\n    in which the world's languages are communicated
  and recorded.\r\n    This collection has been closed for two years and needs\r\n
  \   re-opening to public access, educational and scholarly use \u2013\r\n    not
  broken up or put into storage as is curently being\r\n    proposed. The Type Museum's
  \ collections need exhibiting,\r\n    curatorial & conservation development and
  educational workshops\r\n    - not storage. This legacy is vital for the quality
  of\r\n    education of future generations of communicators in which\r\n    Britain
  has frequently led the world. We appeal for resources\r\n    to restore and safeguard
  educational access to these\r\n    collections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is of course
  the pre-existing online petition to the Trustees which has gathered upward of 680
  signatures:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ipetitions.com/petition/typemuseum/\r\n\r\n\"The London
  Type Museum is the most comprehensive type museum in the world. Its collections
  are vast, representing nearly all of the world's written languages in their historic
  printed form. It is a timeline in letters, a record of printed history from the
  earliest days through the present. It is also the last place where Monotype technicians
  continue to manually cut typefaces.\r\n\r\nVisitors to this unique working museum
  have been able to watch as type is cast, view presses in action and engage in hands-on
  workshops. The importance of the museum as an educational resource and source of
  inspiration for today's designers is immeasurable.\r\n\r\nThese valuable collections
  are now in danger of being broken up and dispersed to the Science Museum and the
  V&A, where they will likely be placed in storage.\r\n\r\nThis petition will be presented
  to the Trustees of the Type Museum as evidence that the public does not want to
  see this unique museum closed.\r\n\r\nPlease show your support!\"\r\n\r\nDecember
  2008\r\nA Freedom of Information Request to DCMS reveals 2006 Consultants Report
  for NMSI entitled [[http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/foi_requests/5529.aspx|'Type
  Museum Otions Appraisal']] Delineates many of the Type Museum Society\u2019s supporters
  fears. DCMS points out it is out of date and implies NMSI has to be approached to
  find out what is currently planned. But it remains as one of the most detailed documents
  discussing the options being considered for the Museum - That it needed in 2006
  a gift of a \xA31M and an \xA38M Endowment to secure a future but that this would
  probably require an enhanced trust management.\r\n\r\nThe report vindicated the
  value of the collections. It is particularly noted that the authors suggest an intensive
  documentation project option. To be conducted before any shutdown, removal or dispersal
  of the collections - and in particular emphasises the need for some sort of documentary/oral/process
  history approach to record the skill and knowledge embodied and still practised
  by the Monotype engineers who continue to work on site.\r\n\r\n\"It is museological,
  culturally, and professionally unethical to allow these intellectual assets to be
  lost, even if the museum has to close.\"\r\n"
