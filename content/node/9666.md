body: Now for one that requires a bit more thinking about. How do you typographically
  encompass the word &#39;Citizen&#39; without specifying a certain place of belonging.
  <BR> <BR>&#40;Which typeface do you believe most encapsulates the word &#39;Citizen&#39;.
  I am doing a study into typographic reactions to words, there have been some great
  responses so far. All the results will be published on my website with an accompanying
  conclusion.&#41; <BR> <BR>It would be fantastic if people could respond, there were
  some great responses to fear. I&#39;d really appreciate it.  <BR> <BR>Thanks

    would be nationality specific. <BR>Perhaps Caslon fits the bill. <BR> <BR><img
