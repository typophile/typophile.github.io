    They are both made for primary use in book. Pdf-booklets are available for download
    on my site;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.macrhino.com\r\n\r\nRegarding sizes, 9.5 to 11 points
    is about the optimal for body copy in books."

    size."

  body: "Since there is much from where to choose, I believe you should try to identify
    the personality of the written text and kind of speech, because there is much
    difference between setting text with Adobe Garamond and Swift, for instance. I
    usually choose body text between 9 and 11, with a difference of 2,5 or 3 pts leading,
    that is, 9,5/12pts. Beware of the proportion! Why 2 columns?\r\nA very good setting
    can be achieved with Slimbach's Minion 10x12,5pts with a 21 pica line length single
    column. It's a elegant typeface and also quite condensed.\r\nDid that help?"

  body: "Thanks for all your suggestions Pieter, Stefan, patttyfab it was helpful.\r\n\r\nSeml
    the text is about Medical Professors talking about a certain medical condition,so
    it is a Medical Textbook where doctors are going to use it,you also have a lot
    of text & graphs/tables.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted to say is that I am splitting the
    text in to 2 columns per page rather than 1 single long coloumn, I felt that would
    help reading\r\n\r\nRegards"

  body: "Whether or not 2 columns is more readable depends on the trim size. Since
    it's a text book I'm guessing it's at least 8 x 10 in which case 2 columns probably
    is best. You don't want too many characters per line, but not too few either.\r\n\r\nHowever
    I'm not sure about Goudy for a medical text, it is such a warm friendly face.
    I might go for something simpler such as Adobe Caslon or Garamond or Minion, and
    then use a sans serif for the graphs and tables."
