  body: Hmmm... tough one. The serifs are Latin, but the character shapes are anything
    but. I wouldn't know if there's anything similar.

  body: "I'd license any heavy face with small-ish serifs (latin or not), as long
    as the basic forms mixed with the logo well enough. That \"C,\" with it's flat
    horizontals, is the distinctive feature that I get hung up on most. If it weren't
    for that, almost any woodtype-inspired display face would do\u2026"

  body: OK, I take that back. Type hunting is almost as fun as drinking. I should
    combine the two. But it will have to be longdrinks; I'm out of beer.

  body: <a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/oneliner14.html">TF Margate</a> is not
    very close, not so wide and without those serifs and that kind of "C", but take
    a look.

  body: Several years back, I did a freeware face called <strong>Franken's Stein</strong>,
    which applied the unusual inline treatment used in the Beck's logo, but not the
    letterforms themselves.

  body: Me thinks Gerard Unger's Swift has certain characteristics that makes it compatible,
    esp. the heavier cuts.
