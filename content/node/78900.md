  | Fontspring]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/flapper/ | Myfonts.com]].\r\n\r\nFlapper
  is family which embodies a great deal of fun and more than a little spirit of the
  roaring 20s.  If ever a set of typefaces could dance a high kicking Charleston,
  these are they.  Flapper is offered in regular, condensed, oblique and outline forms,
  and they all bring a great deal of fun and life wherever they are used.  The Flapper
  family (yes, think of one of those dancing 20s girls with a long string of pearls...)
  is ideal for casual heading, bold captions, poster work and anywhere else a sense
  of fun is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Flapper-1_6170.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Flapper-2_4100.png]"
