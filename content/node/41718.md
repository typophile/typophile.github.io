  I have a client who wants a t-shirt graphic that uses the same typeface that is
  used in their logo, but unfortunately they don't know what it is and I've tried
  unsuccessfully to identify it myself. Here's a sample of the type in question;\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/watersplash_5475.jpg]\r\n\r\nJudging
  by the 'l' and the 'h' I would guess that it's been customized a little, but you
  can still clearly see how the characters are formed. The lowercase 's' is quite
  distinctive, hopefully this might help somebody to identify it.\r\n\r\nThanks a
  lot!\r\n\r\n- M"
