  body: I've seen it used both ways. I don't think it has a convention. I personally
    like Email.

  body: Both are correct. However, "email" is probably more contemporary than "e-mail."

  body: While either version of email/e-mail may be considered correct (although I'd
    go with the OED), "Im" without an apostrophe is not.

    of brand name.

    some sort of brand name.</em>\r\n\r\nWeb is an abbreviation of 'World Wide Web',
    which is a proper noun, so it should be capitalised. As for being a brand name,
    I'm not sure what the status of the full name is, but I wouldn't be at all surprised
    if it has been trademarked for protective purposes by the W3 Consortium."

    our house style (read: AP + internal counsel [I don't really get why he gets to
    decide it, either]) still has us using \"Web sites\", I'm glad our editors don't
    apostrophize decades. (And considering <a href=\"http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/\">it's
    all about cars</a> and it would be everywhere? <em>phew!</em>)"

    because the pronunciation simply changes when you lose the hyphen. Not only that,
    compounds like that just need the hyphen. I'm sure there are many examples of
    neat hyphenated compounds, but can't conjure any up at the moment."

  body: "The general tendency in English seems to be for these compounds to close
    up over time (so 'space ship' became 'space-ship' became 'spaceship') except where
    the closed-up versions would cause potential confusion - looking like an existing
    word for example. At the moment, Oxford's <em>Dictionary for Writers and Editors</em>
    suggests 'website' (and, by the way, accepts both 'email' and 'e-mail' but prefers
    the former).\r\n\r\n______________________________\r\nEver since I chose to block

    used to be capitalized when it was new too.\r\n\r\nAs everyone stated, it really
    doesn't matter how you write it. Consistency is the key. Personally, we've been
    on the web long enough where I consider all of these generic nouns: web, email,
    website, internet. \r\n\r\nas for e-mail, that was ALWAYS an odd one to me. Doesn't
    seem to follow any established english language rules. But, since when did english
    make that much sense to begin with. ;o)"

    any established english language rules.\"\r\n\r\nWell, it does follow the compound
    rules where two words aren't easily joined. Spaceship is the one side of that
    where they grow towards each other, e-mail is the other. Because \"e-mail\" has
    an inherent defined pronunciation, it has my preference. In Dutch, it's mandatory
    because the pronunciation changes an awful lot without the hyphen. I won't be
    one to tell English people how to do it on this topic, however. I'm still foreign
