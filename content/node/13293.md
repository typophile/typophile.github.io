  the long texts written in it unreadable. What are your comments? The boss has asked
  me to give 1-2 printed pages using different fonts. Which fonts should I choose?
  I am thinking aout Garamond and Palatino. What leading I should keep for these fonts
  at 11pt and 12pt? I am planning to write the text on typography. Do you have any
  suggestions for the text? Thank you very much in advance.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nRahul.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Rahul, my suggestion for the text is to use something that will have your
    boss looking at the legibility of the text not the content. I suggest something
    like a chapter of Alice in Wonderland or Through the Looking Glass. \r\n\r\nDepending
    on the font I'd look at 9 or 10 pt type. I think 12 pt type is way to large. Think
    of your local newspaper or common magazine. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of Garamonds,
    specify which one you were thinking of using. Take a look at Plantin as well as
    Palatino and Melior.\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts"

  body: "Trebuchet: Ick!\r\n\r\nRahul, can you purchase fonts, or do you have to pick
    a system font? Are you restricted to certain sizes? Different fonts look bigger
    or smaller at the same sizes. Digital Palatino works better than Trebuchet for
    text, but it's so expansive, it looks best at about 8.5 - 9 point, and frankly
    clumsy at 12 point. I suspect the Palatino on everyone's system was made from
    9-point drawings. \r\n\r\nIf you are picking a single type family for use in all
    documents, make it something very quiet and serviceable, like Minion, Sabon, or
    the robust <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11069.7.27\">Clifford
    Nine</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/verdigris/pk_verdigris.htm\">Verdigris</a>.
    Those last 2 would allow you to use a smaller size, like 9 point, without anyone
    complaining, and you might save a tree.  Then there's the elegant and economical
    <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=414154\">Laurentian</a>.
    There are many useful text faces that are better than Trebuchet out there. It
    depends on how hard the typeface has to work and what kind of budget you have. "

  body: "Palatino was foundry type, and was adjusted for different sizes. Unfortunately
    the one everyone sees is from a small master. If you look at signage, often you
    will see the more refined, slender display version. For some reason every parking
    garage in SF uses it. Hrant's point is good; Aldus performs quite well in text,
    and is more economical as well. It's likely, though, that few people in the typical
    office will be able to tell Aldus and Palatino apart.... \r\n\r\nDoes anyone offer
    the Palatino Display in digital version? "

  body: "I have to agree with Hrant on Aldus. It probably depends also on size \r\nand
    paper, but I have seen Palatino looking great and awful as text. \r\nI suspect
    that the 'great' was actually Aldus. \r\n\r\nHere is Linotype on Aldus:\r\n\r\n
    \"Designed by Hermann Zapf for D. Stempel AG, this typeface was \r\noriginally
    intended to be the book or text weight for his  Palatino\u2122 \r\nfont family.
    It was instead released as a separate font with the name \r\nAldus\u2122 in 1954.
    Aldus has the distinction of being lighter and \r\nnarrower than Palatino, which
    makes it a good choice for book \r\ntypography, though Palatino has also gained
    popularity as a text \r\nface.\"\r\n\r\n>Depending on the font I\u2019d look at
    9 or 10 pt type. I think 12 pt \r\ntype is way to large. Think of your local newspaper
    or common \r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nI think the 'depending on the font' needs clarification.
    It may be \r\nthat Palatino will work much better at small sizes, because it is
    \r\ndark and wide - but others will be worse at small sizes. In general \r\nyou
    need to consider your page dimensions, number of columns, the \r\nmeasure (width)
    of the columns, the possible leading, and the \r\nx-height of the face. Some 12
    point type will look fine and others \r\n(maybe Palatino) bad.\r\n\r\nIt is the
    combination of size, measure and leading and face that are \r\ncritical for readability,
    not one by itself. The width, x-height and \r\ndarkness of the type, as well as
    the measure, affect the leading. \r\nBringhurst says that 45-75 lower case characters
    is the generally \r\nagreed-upon acceptable range, with 66 lower case characters,
    or about \r\ntwo and a half lower case alphabets ideal for single columns. I think
    \r\nthis is one of the most important and too often neglected variables. \r\n\r\nIn
    my opinion don't even think about a sans serif for extended text. \r\nBut you
    can get away with it to some degree if you have narrow \r\ncolumns and enough
    leading.  \r\n\r\n "

  body: "<em>Does anyone offer the Palatino Display in digital version?</em>\r\n\r\nVery
    soon, Linotype will release Hermann Zapf's Palatino nova, the most extensive digital
    Palatino ever. It will have two display weights, both based on more old metal
    Stempel Palatino alternates, Michelangelo and Sistina. An Aldus nova is also part
    of the overall release (although I think that Palatino nova works well in text
    sizes, too).\r\n\r\nMany here may remember Akira Kobayshi's presentation of Palatino
    nova at TypeCon last year. There, he also announced that a Sans family has been
    designed by Hermann Zapf as well.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: Trebuchet is good for screens. I am using it in my papers which is supposed
    to be readed online and I made my text small paragraphs because  if they printed
    it .. I don't think it can handel huge text. And all what I got from what you
    said is that you want a font for several amounts of text.. alot of fonts are good
    but it depends on the layout and the porpose of your design. if you gone for 9
    pt -12 pt avreage I advice you to use serif fonts.. because serifs help the conception
    of reader to remember recognize the letter shape faster, at this point you have
    alot of fonts to select.

    all come out at once, within the next few months. The sans faces will then come
