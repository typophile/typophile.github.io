  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings,

I'm currently developing an OpenType font that contains two sets of figures -- Lining Proportional figures as the default and Lining Tabular figures activated with the "tnum" feature. 

The Lining Tabular glyphs are named in Adam Twardoch's suggested form of "number.lnum_tnum" and are in the class "@FIG_TAB_LINING", the Lining Proportional figures are in the class "@FIG_FIT_LINING" but the problem also occurs without using classes.

The problem is that InDesign labels the glyphs in the tnum feature as being both tnum and onum even though there is no onum feature in this font. This is to say that in the Glyph palette rolling over the Tabular glyphs shows that they are "Tabular Figures (tnum) + Oldstyle Figures (onum)", and the OpenType submenu of the character palette gives the option to select "Tabular Oldstyle".

I understand that the pnum and tnum features are modifiers for lnum and onum (applying tnum could change lnum_pnum and onum_pnum to their tabular counterparts), so I'm not sure if there's a way that I can or should specify that the glyphs in the tnum feature are *only* lining, and never oldstyle.

To fix this problem I've tried adding an onum feature with a different set of glyphs in from font with the idea that it might draw InDesign's attention away from thinking the tnum group could contain oldstyle figures. I've also switched to using the tabular figures as the default and creating a pnum feature instead, but this ends in the same result of InDesign thinking that the glyphs are both proportional lining and oldstyle.

I've been able  to reproduce this in more than one font and I'm using FontLab 4.6 on the Macintosh.

Has anyone else see this? Any thoughts would be much appreciated!

Thanks,
Andy Clymer</div>

Your Default Figures (DF) being Lining Proportional (LP) might be confusing InDesign, as most fonts have Lining Tabular (LT) as default.

Here's what you need to have as your feature:

feature tnum { # Tabular Figures
 # Latin
    sub @classDF by @classLT;
} tnum;

And this should be in your classes:

@classDF = [zero one two three four five six seven eight nine];
@classLT = [zero.LT one.LT two.LT three.LT four.LT five.LT six.LT seven.LT eight.LT nine.LT];

What I had written after the above was that you should name your LT glyphs as above: zero.LT one.LT etc. This scheme allows the Glyph Panel to see the "children" glyphs and offer them under the pulldowns for the "parent" glyphs.</div>

As far as I can tell I'm writing the feature code the same way that you are, for testing I've stripped the font down to just the "tnum" feature that I posted above.

InDesign switches from the default Proportional Lining figures to the Tabular Lining figures without any problems with this code, it's just that it also still thinks that the glyphs that are in the tnum feature are also in an onum feature.</div>

Did you know that you can access OT features using Text Edit. Here's how:
Type some text.
Select it.
Hit Command-T for the Font Palette.
Change the font to your OT font.
Click and hold the little "Tool" cog icon button in the bottom left corner of the Font Palette.
Select Typography...
A new palette will pop up which gives you access to your font's features. (Even SSes!)

		<div class="commentbody">About the ".lnum_tnum" naming, I was following Adam Twardoch's suggestions from <a href="http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/general.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=4966&LastModified=4675540745632224845">this Fontlab Forum thread</a>, he breaks things down pretty well for building a font that's going to take advantage of all four figure substitution possibilities, but that's not a concern with this font.

His explanation is good (and I'll respond to that thread with this question when I've been approved to be added to the FontlabForum) in explaining that "tnum" isn't Lining or Oldstyle specific. I'm sure that InDesign just sees that a class can be switched from any kind of proportional to any kind of tabular and just assumes that the glyphs within could belong to either or both.

I'm wondering if anyone else has tried to build an OTF with Prop and Tab Lining figures and see what comes up?

Here's what InDesign shows for a glyph that is only in the tnum class and feature:

Or maybe I'm thinking of something else. Just a hunch. <strong>Edit:</strong> Never mind. I <em>must</em> be thinking of something else.

FWIW, I built Proxima Nova with proportional lining figures as the default without a problem. I did not give them any special names, just one, two, three, etc. For the other three variants, I used .tnum for tabular lining, .onum for proportional old style and .tonum for tabular old style. I don't thing the naming of the variants matters, but the naming of the default figures probably does.</div>

As for the glyph name suffixes, they are fully arbitrary. You can call your lining tabular one "one.LT", "one.lftf", "one.ltf, "one.lnum_tnum", "one.liningtabular", "one.mylefteyebrow" etc. What is important is the use of the period and the suffixes. 

At Fontlab Ltd., we recommend using four-letter suffix parts that are derived from OpenType feature names due to consistency. The glyph name suffixes are not standardized in any way but the OpenType Layout feature tags are (lnum, onum, smcp). The only way you can have industry-wide consistency is to use consistent suffixes, and the only way to do it is to use suffixes based on standardized strings -- that being the OpenType Layout feature tags. So a small-caps A should be "A.smcp", but it can also be "A.sc" or "A.small" or whatever, but not "Asmall" (since there is no period and no suffix). 

Whenever there is a suffix where a glyph is accessed through a combination of features (like onum+tnum), we recommend sorting the suffix parts alphabetically and concatenating the suffix parts using underscore (e.g. "one.pnum_smcp" and "one.smcp_tnum"). 

But really, the only advantage of this approach is that it's systematic. If you don't care for being systematic, you can use any glyph suffixes you want. 

Andy, 

something is probably wrong with your OpenType Layout feature code. The glyph naming doesn't really matter so much. Contact Fontlab Ltd. support at http://www.fontlab.com/problem/ for that and we'll take a look. 

Regards, 
Adam

As for InDesign and the features, this is essentially a limitation of the way InDesign's UI is set up to access the figure styles in pairs: one of [lining, oldstyle] and one of [tabular, proportional]. If you have even one of the two features in the pair, InDesign will give people the option of turning on both features. The reasons for this have to do with InDesign not knowing what your default figure type is, and the fact that you might have one but not both features of one of the pairs, even though you are in fact supporting the desired result.

One option would be for InDesign to go to a model where you set oldstyle vs. lining with one toggle and tabular vs. proportional with another. But for most cases that would mean two trips to the menu where today one gets by with one. So it's not an attractive option with the current UI. If some day InDesign gets a palette approach like Illustrator, it might be a little easier to go down that path.

So, your figures are all lining, and the distinction 
is tabular vs proportional only.
Which means, you decide which set of figures shall 
be the standard figures (say, tabular ones) and name 
them zero one two three ... plus according class.
The other ones will be proportional, with appendix
.pnum (or whatever else, I confess my appendices
are quite arbitrary too) plus according class.

The tnum feature now substitutes zero.pnum one.pnum 
two.pnum three.pnum ... by zero one two three ...
The pnum feature replaces zero one two three ... by 
zero.pnum one.pnum two.pnum three.pnum ... 

As long as you would not add oldstyle figures, you
don't need lnum (lining) and onum (oldstlye) features
at all.


Chester -- DF/scotch as default is a VERY nice
solution! 
(And the I-hate-doing-figures me says, oh dear, one 
more set of figures ...)

... which is true. And now I am curious:
(1) In which way are figure styles offered in TextEdit/10.4?
(2) And, even more interesting, in what about Windows 
Vista applications?

No, it would not. If you have a selection between two options (proportional vs. tabular, old-style vs. lining) or even a selection between four different versions (proportional old-style, proportional lining, tabular old-style, tabular lining), checkboxes are the worst UI implementation you could choose. 

Karsten writes: 
> (1) In which way are figure styles offered in TextEdit/10.4?

Two groups of radio buttons, one for the proportion (tabular vs. proportional), and the other for alignment (lining vs. old-style).

That depends on how you write your XAML file.

So there probably isn't a problem with the way I'm building the features for this font, it's just because there's no way to describe to InDesign that in this font the tabular figures are always lining and never oldstyle?

I'm curious though, the only figure related feature in this font is tnum but in the glyph palette when I mouse over a glyph from the tnum feature it says that the glyph is <a href="http://www.andyclymer.com/temp/featurepopup.gif">"Tabular Figures (tnum) + Oldstyle Figures (onum)"</a>, but why wouldn't it also assume that the glyph could be Tabular and Lining? If there isn't even an onum feature in the font I don't think we should be seeing "Oldstyle Figures (onum)" here, do you agree?

Much appreciated,
-- Andy

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Andy;
What you see in the glyph palette in InDesign is the possible features the glyph could be a part of. I just generated Tabular Lining, Proportional Lining, Proportional Onum and Tab Onum.
I wrote the features:
feature tnum {
  sub @linfig by @tablinfig;
  sub @onum by @tabonum;
} tnum;

&
feature onum {
  sub @linfig by @onum;
} onum;

if I choose Tabular Oldstyle in InDesign I get it, even if I have Proportional Lining Figure.
When I mouse over the glyph palette I see possible actions between existing glyphs with names similar to my features and after adding Old Style figures the choise tab onum is no longer listed by the Lining Fig as you have it. But now I see pnum by proportional oldstyle though its actually in tnum feature and lnum by Lining Figures though its actually in the onum feature. So its the same naming, but not the feature on and off, it's the action.
And then until you have defined that default is lining you can get tabular figures by both tab Oldstyle and tab lining
