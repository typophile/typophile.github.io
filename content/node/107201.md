body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nThis is my first post, so I apologize if I miss some typophile-related
  etiquette. :)\r\n\r\nAnyways, I need to design a book of eight theater plays. They
  are adaptations of kids' classics like Mary Poppins, Robin Hood, Adventures of Huckleberry
  Finn and the like by a croatian author. However, the book is not targeted (only)
  towards kids, but to anyone interested in making these plays come to life---actors,
  directors, etc---and friends of a local town theater these plays originate from.
  The editor would like for the book to be as inviting as possible to read.\r\n\r\nPlays
  are cheerful in tone and have a bit of a rural and/or 'retro' feeling to them. There
  is a subtle environmentalistic message which expands through all of the plays in
  the book.\r\n\r\nI chose somewhat traditional, or classic, layout for the book,
  because of the classic character of the plays. One font for the whole book---Adobe
  Caslon Pro---for its cheerful (and retro) character. It will be 13,5cm x 21,5 cm,
  so it should be easily handholdable and it'll be printed on recycled cream toned
  paper. I chose this type of paper because of the environmental overtones and also
  cream-toned paper should be more pleasant to read.\r\n\r\nSince plays have very
  few paragraphs in a traditional sense, there were many cases of single lines (how
  do you call them -- orphans, widows?) going to the next page. This called for a
  flexible lower margins -- every now and then, I had to expand the text box a leading.
  This is the prime reason I put page numbering on the outside margins. If they were
  in the lower marging, that 'breathing' text box would be much more perceivable.
  Also, when working on a play, people often have to search for their line in the
  script and I think that page numbering right above the thumb of the reader is easier
  to track when in hurry.\r\n\r\nCharacter names are in red because actors from this
  local theater often underline their character names. This makes for a nice contrast
  between blue or black pen strokes if they want to do that. It also gives a bit more
  depth and a sense of uniqueness to the text.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you think? Do you
  have some suggestions? Do you think that two ink colours are a bit too chaotic?
  Are inner margins a too large? Maybe something else doesn't seem right? I'd very
  much like to hear your critique since this is my first try at book designing in
  a more traditional sense.\r\n\r\nAlso, you'll have to excuse my English, I'm not
  a native speaker and the book itself is in Croatian so chances are you won't understand
  a word. O:)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nVedran\r\n\r\nP.S. Gray rectangles are places for
  the illustrations -- this book is stil a work in progress."

  body: "Very nice work, Vedran. Just a couple of things:\r\n\r\n1. printing in two
    colors, of course, will cost you more - by the way, I haven't understood if the
    book is only aimed to standard readers or if the actors will actually use it for
    rehearsal?\r\n\r\n2. in the text layout - which is very well done - put more than
    one space (three white spaces should work) between the character's name and the
    beginning of his/her dialogue (eg. TIANA I tako je Huck...) This is a standard
    setting in plays book.\r\n\r\nBy the way, which size is the text set in?\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps,\r\nNicola"

  body: "How is this going to be bound?  If it is perfect bound (a paperback book)
    the inner margins may be too small, particularly on the right hand (odd number)
    pages. The character names may disappear into the gutter, the binding of the book.
    Having enough inner margin is important.\r\n\r\nWhy is the right inner margin
    different than the left inner margin? This would not be my choice.\r\n\r\nI would
    put the page numbers where the audience expects them to be.\r\n\r\nThere is not
    much advantage to having the names in red, since the names are already differentiated
    by small caps and by indenting. The red looks okay, but maybe it's not necessary.\r\n\r\nI
    do not look at books of plays very often, but these are my opinions."

  body: "Looks good, Vedrane! \r\nI like your approach that quite traditional typeface
    choice may also lead to an inviting reading experience! Perhaps you could increase
    the leading by 1pt to make it look even more open. \r\nMore horizontal spacing
    after the character names has already been mentioned by Nicola, that is standard
    also in the German-speaking drama typography (ne znam, ali pogledaj neke knjige
    klasi\u010Dne drame kako to radi u hrvatskoj). \r\nThe idea with putting the page
    number in the outer margin is also nice, and I even understood they are on the
    same line as the chapter heading. Yet, this also has drawbacks: 1) your page numbers
    might be mistaken for line numbers (which are common especially in critical editions,
    but that might be my bias as a philologist), 2) they might be harder to find than
    if they had been in traditional places \u2013 head or foot of the page \u2013,
    and you might even put your fingers on top of them. \r\nWhen working with such
    projects I always created a dummy by printing variations of the layout, cutting
    them to size and sticking them into a book of the same size to get a simulated
    hands-on on what works best. \r\nJust another hint: On page 76, there are some
    straight quotes, check with your editor/publisher how they want them (I\u2019d
    go for \u201Etik-takanje\u201C). \r\n"

  body: "Thank you for your feedback!\r\n\r\nnicolacaleffi; I pointed out to the client
    that printing in two colours will cost more, but they don't seem to have a problem
    with that. On the other hand, there is a cost problem with hardcover vs. paperback
    binding. Do you think that setting text in one colour would be that much cheaper
    to allow the clients to go for hardcover? At this moment, I should mention that
    there are eight full colour illustrations, one at the beggining of each play.\r\n\r\nThe
    book is primarily aimed at regular readers but some actors, and directors especially,
    will use it for rehearsals, as well. Unfortunately, reading habits are rather
    low here in Croatia so the majority of people will buy the book because they were
    either somehow involved in the work of the theater or they have (or had) someone
    in the family who is involved with it. I'm afraid that many buyers will buy the
    book just to have it sit on the bookshelf.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of using more
    than one space after the character name but it looked somehow odd to me when set.
    Could be because of the red-coloured names. Didn't realize it was standard. I'll
    give it a try again.\r\n\r\nType is set in 11 point size with 14 pt leading.\r\n\r\nJ.
    Tillman; you have sharp eyes -- you're adressing to almost all layout-related
    problems I have.\r\n\r\nBinding is not yet clearly defined with the printing company.
    I'll try to insist on sewn binding - both for paperback and hardcover. The printing
    company showed me some of their earlier work relevant to this book and they had
    the type of binding where gutter expands almost completely. I lack proper knowledge
    and nomenclature in technical aspects of bookbinding so I may be talking nonsense.\r\n\r\nText
    boxes are symmetrical on both pages but I have negative indent on character names
    which makes right inner margin smaller then the left one. It also makes the left
    outer margin smaller then the right one, too. If I off-set text boxes to the right,
    then I have a problem with continuous text which then looks off-set to the right.\r\n\r\nIf
    I put page numbers to the usual place, how can I solve the problem of 'breathing'
    text box I described in the initial post?\r\n\r\nThe red isn't necessary, that's
    for sure, but I think it gives a bit more expensive feel to the book. Which seems
    important to potential buyers who aren't necesserily intereted in actually reading
    it.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for your opinions and suggestions -- means a lot!"

  body: "Stephan Kurz; your croatian is quite good! Do you have some relatives here
    or know someone from Croatia? :)\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with book length --
    it's almost 450 pages long and the editor insists on smalller format. I tried
    to keep the text as dense as possible and still retain the 'open' feel. If the
    book were thicker, I'm afraid it would look bulky and heavy and uninviting to
    easily intimidated croatian readers. I'll try putting an extra point of leading
    and see how it will affect the number of pages.\r\n\r\nYou have a good point on
    page numbering. I'll definitely try putting them on the foot of the page. This
    could bypass the 'breathing text box' problem while retaining traditional layout.\r\n\r\nI
    also print out my layout and cut them to size but I never got my mind to putting
    it in an existing book! That's a great trick -- thanks!\r\n\r\nThe text is still
    not completely proofed and I'm sure the editor will adress the quotes and similar
    mistakes.\r\n\r\nThanks again! :)"

  body: "Vedran:\r\n\r\n1. Hardcover vs softcover: here in Italy, an hardcover binding
    is still  *much* more expensive than a softcover one. Also, if the book must be
    kept in hand by actors, it should be easily handy, and in this case a softcover
    book could be preferable. It is also true that an hardcover book will look more
    \"classical\". As a sidenote, a very nice hardcover binding is the \"Bodonian\",
    where the open spread pages really lie flat. And yes, binding must be sewn.\r\n\r\n2.
    If illustrations must be printed in colors, and they are just 8 on a total of
    +400 pages, consider the possibility to print in four colors just the 8 sixtodecimos
    where the illustrations appear (in this case, you will have to set  the characters'
    name in black, keep the illustrations in color, and thus reduce the total cost
    of printing while mantaining the colors in the drawings).\r\n\r\n3. Another factor
    to consider with the client and the printer is the quality of the paper - if you
    choose the right one (a cream uncoated one is the first that comes to mind for
    this project) the book will gain in quality. And if you want to keep it small
    enough and portable, look for the right grammage - the printer could set up a
    mock up of the book before printing it.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\nN"
