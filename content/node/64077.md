body: "Fellow members,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for some advice to pick the right type to
  set a book with. The book is an anthology of articles about activism.\r\n\r\nThe
  idea is to mimic the publications from the Situationist International, which was
  a primarily French movement from the 1950's and 1960's. What would a French typographer
  from that period typically choose for body text? And no, I will not use Avant Garde
  ;-).\r\n\r\nThe style of the situationist is very lo-fidelity, cut'n'paste and much
  like an underground newspaper. It's rather elitist and cares little about optimizing
  for such things as legibility.\r\n\r\nWhat would you go for?\r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International|Here's
  a link for some context on Wikipedia]]"

  body: "That sure is an interesting project!\r\nThe problem is twofold: for one,
    if all you want is to mimic the typographic choices of a french publication from
    the early sixties, you risk to end up with something bland (as in the example
    shown in the page you linked)*.\r\nThe most important side, though, is that in
    so doing you would betray the very spirit of situationism.\r\nSituationism is
    about what works <em>now</em>. It's about subverting conventions and conventional
    wisdom. And using them to attain a political goal. Art is the primary political
    weapon of the situationists.\r\nA trivial suggestion would be, for example, setting
    an article about animal rights/anti-fur activism using the poshest didoni** available.
    \r\n\r\n\r\n* Which, to tell the truth, is italian, but you got the point.\r\n**

    and Vend\xF4me - not really fitting here I think.\r\nI'd go for something \"international
    style\": Akzidenz Grotesk, Helvetica, Folio, Recta, Forma, Mercator ... well,
    maybe Antique can look interesting."

  body: "Yes, interesting!\r\n\r\nHowever I'm confused concerning \"elitist\" vs \"underground\".\r\nPlus
    the typographic examples in that Wikipedia article are\r\ncompletely docile and
    unremarkable. Could you elaborate?\r\n\r\nRiccardo, is it possible you're recommending
    Italian Fat Face?  ;-)\r\nhttp://www.woodtyper.com/wp/uploads/2009/09/caslon-italian.gif\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
