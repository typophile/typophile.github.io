body: where do you buy your fonts from? are you loyal to any one retailer? what do
  you base your considerations on? convenience? customer service? marketing? selection?
  licensing arrangements? <BR>i know that there are many considerations for each individual
  purchase, but is there one &#40;or two or three&#41; place&#40;s&#41; that you keep
  going back to again and again? <BR>who do you think some of the more successful
  retailers are? why do you think they&#39;re successful? <BR> <BR>just some questions
  i&#39;ve been wondering about.

    or book or while checking out foundry sites and I just have to have it for my
    collection. <BR> <BR>I guess I am just a sucker for a great typeface. <BR> <BR>In

    fonts from designers on my own site whenever a project suits one of our collection:

  body: I have bought from Adobe, MyFonts, FontBureau, and FontShop. I buy from whomever
    has what I need or want.  <BR> <BR>The fact that I can rely on Adobe and FontBureau
    to be of a high standard of craftsmanship does makes a difference to me.  <BR>
    <BR>I really wish there were some technical way to preview a font fully, and then
    decide to buy it or not. I really can&#39;t tell how good a font will be for what
    I want without trying it out.  <BR> <BR>The MyFonts and other previews are good,
    but only for something very brief. PDFs are also very helpful, but there is nothing
    like setting at the size and measure and leading you want, and seeing what it
    looks like.  <BR> <BR>Now that I think of it, maybe the vendors could have a program
    where you could fill in specs, and automatically get sent back a PDF short paragraph
    - now that would be helpful!

  body: When you buy from MyFonts, which foundries do you purchase? Are there any
    foundries on MyFonts that you avoid? If you see that a typeface is being sold
    concurrently by several foundries, which one do you chose?

  body: Checking MyFonts, ITC New Baskerville is $21 per weight for the Linotype version;
    it is $22 per weight at Linotype, 25.99 at Adobe and $29 per weight at ITC Fonts.
    I think &#40;am I right?&#41; these are identical, so it makes sense to get them
    from Myfonts, whose site is also very user-friendly. Myfonts seems to license
    the Linotype version of classics, and these are I think reliable and cheaper than
    competitors for the same thing, so I will go for that option, other things being
    equal.

  body: I&#39;ve purchased from Font Bureau, Emigre, Phil&#39;s Fonts, FontFont, and
    Adobe. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not loyal, per se, to any of them, but I like a lot of
    offerings from all of them. <BR> <BR>My first and foremost consideration is the
    fonts themselves. The next is the collection as a whole. However, if I can&#39;t
    get a good, fast overview of the offerings &#40;usually in print form&#41;, I
    am less inclined to remember and therefore think of buying.
