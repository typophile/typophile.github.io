  Foucault etc. in English and whose books are nicely designed and produced. I live
  in Amsterdam, and there seems to be plenty of nicely designed philosophy books in
  Dutch (in particular Uitgeverij SUN \u2014 stiched binding, nice typography), whilst
  all the English publishers' efforts are dire. I just can't bring myself to spend
  \u20AC20 on a book that looks like it is printed on toilet paper and bound with
  pritt-stick, let alone attempt to read it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be great\r\n\r\n\u2014
  Phil"

    prices, a book club like <a href=\"http://www.eastonpress.com/intro2.asp\">The
    Easton Press</a> is a good place to get well-printed editions of all sorts of
    \ classics. You can often buy large lots of these books on eBay at a big discount
    because they\u2019re quite popular with elderly readers, but not with their heirs. "

  body: "Start with abebooks.com and look for English translations -- we had tons
    of articles photocopied into my \"Philosophical Directions in Environmental Design\"
    by Derrida et al that were in English.\r\n\r\nNot that most of them were well
    designed, but they were, at least, half-decent translations, not to mention the
    other candidates (Heidigger, Nietzsche, Foucault, Johnston, Wittgenstein, etc.).
    In particular, you might want to check the bibliography in Jan Zwicky's <em>Wisdom
    and Metaphor</em>, which has some excellent English sources of philosophical translations.\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer:
    Jan and I went to high school together, and she's one of the more interesting
    philosophers I know. She's also a professional musician, and a rather good poet
    -- she's won the award as Canada's top poet, actually -- as well.)"
