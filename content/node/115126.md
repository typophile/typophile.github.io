  body: "OK, I understand now.\r\nI still have a problem with recommending a font
    that you feel isn't very good.\r\n\r\nBTW, I think the \"x\" might actually be
    fine, since it's a \"crowded\" letter; in the same way that an \"s\" (in a text
    font) must look slightly too light \u2013when you look at it large\u2013 for it
    to end up balanced.\r\n\r\nPalatino: I think John might be worried that outlines
    might have been re-used, but that's just a guess.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "No hrant, I'm not being dismissive at all. Sorry if it come out sounding
    like that.\r\n\r\nWhen you said that the /z was too dark, I honestly agreed. And
    also added that the /x was too light, and etcetera (meaning that there are also
    a lot of things to tweak or improve).\r\nThings that I'm able to see \"now\",
    but wasn't able to see \"back then\". Things that I've learned to see in the time
    it has passed since the release. If I have to redraw this font again, of course
    there are a lot of things I will like to improve. I loved them at the time of
    release, but now I see lots of things that can be fine-tuned.  I have talked to
    a few colleagues about this feeling, and many share similar feelings with their
    own initial typefaces, since as time passes, you learn to see things different/better.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the Palatino comparative: I see Quattrocento much more closer to Basilea, Friz
    Quadrata and Alexon (Monolines, low contrast). But if someone else sees it similar
    to Palatino (more calligraphic, showing the contrast and the strokes of the nib
    pen) then I'm happy. Palatino is a masterpiece."

  body: "Usually, when I ask MyFonts for similar faces, the results are not too good,
    but today at least a couple of the results actually had some resemblance to the
    target:\r\n\r\nQuadrat Serial\r\nSeptimus\r\n\r\nAlbertus came to my mind; Identifont
    concurred, and added ITC Elan, presumably related to the first one noted above.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and don't forget Flareserif 821 (an Albertus lookalike).\r\n\r\nLooking around
    among the recommended similar faces on Identifont, I came across one that wasn't
    really similar to Friz Quadrata, but was of interest because it was by our own
    Nick Shinn: Paradigm Pro."
