  body: ..just wondering if the back of 12.001 fits into the printable area..? it
    looks very big.. [funny that it is followed by a &#39;less is more&#39; statement
    on 12.002.. heh]

  body: 12.0001 is not yet top shelf, imo, because of that <BR>P. Clever idea, but
    the second P stands out too much. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: 12.001 is one of the best i&#39;ve seen so far as well. just a little bit
    more fine tuning.

  body: Vivian, that rectangle <i>is</i> the printable area. <BR> <BR>I agree about
    12.001, it&#39;s a good concept but the <BR>execution could be refined a lot.
    I&#39;d also dump the T2 on  <BR>the back, it&#39;s not needed.
