  body: "The best thing would be to study what Adobe and MS are doing with latest
    fonts, and read Adobe's <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Feature File Syntax</a> document which describes the syntax
    as used in FLS5 or FM.\r\nI suggest that you also download Adobe's <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/\"
    target=\"_blank\">example roman fonts</a> (in the smaller box there is a link
    \"ExampleRomanFonts.zip\") and have a close look at the files with \"feature\"
    in the name; these are very up-to-date models and cover almost all features currently
    supported in applications.\r\nIn the end, you have to tailor features so they
    match your fonts' glyph sets and glyph names anyway.\r\n"

  body: I think I would not recommend the old fonts as examples any more. Adobe has
    changed a few things, as described in Thomas Phinneys <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/Facelift.pdf"
    target="_blank">Facelift</a> presentation. The sample font provided alongside
    the AFDKO represents current best practice.
