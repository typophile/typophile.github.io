body: "I've been designing flyers, posters and brochures for a company for a while
  and they have now asked me to design a lifestyle guide book/ brochure. \r\nThe book
  is to be fun and flirty but easily approachable and aimed at men and women of  a
  fairly broad age range (18 - 55 year olds) It is a handbag size guide (think the
  small version of a fashion magazine) so space is at a premium.\r\n\r\nThe book will
  be split into chapters and within each chapter include 2 distinct page types:\r\n1.
  Pages which include various product images and reviews of that product (the brochure
  bit)\r\n2. Pages of lifestyle features and guides (the book bit)\r\n\r\nI have never
  before had to deal with such large areas of body text (The features and guides)
  and this is what is giving me nightmares! \r\nI am in 2 minds as whether to use
  a serif font (so it is warm, readable and inviting) or a sans serif font (for it
  clean crisp lines, although I am scared this will end up looking like a text book!)\r\n\r\nI
  need to decide on a font (or group of fonts) that will fulfil my needs and seem
  to be going round in circles so some fresh suggestions from you guys would be much
  appreciated!"

  body: "I would take the opportunity to consider the typography of small caps and
    old style figures in body text.\r\nAlso the integration of italic and bold into
    running text.\r\nBringhurst's style guide is a good reference.\r\nPick fonts that
    you like the look of in sc&osf, and would like to work with. \r\nFor both, spacing
    and height vis \xE0 vis x-height are significant.\r\n\r\n(Some faces with a large
    x-height and short capitals may not require small caps.)"
