  to know the font above ('Carnaval 2012' and 'Itajub\xE1 - MG').\r\n\r\nI used \"What
  the Font is?\" but return me that is a font called TPSalut. But I`m pretty sure
  that not the name of the font I used a time ago to make this layout.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/camisetacarna_2012_final_5629.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you."
