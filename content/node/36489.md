  they used for the Top Chef logo. The closest I've found is Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk
  Extra Bold, which is extremely close, but this logo is just a little more squared
  off.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/topcheflogo_4852.jpg]\r\n\r\n(had
  trouble attaching the file, so I just included the image)"

    kill yourself. At most, a small bodily indury will suffice."

  body: I had tried that along with regular BE Extra Bold, and the two of those looked
    practically identical to me. (I laid them over the logo to compare.) It just seems
    like both of those have larger corner radii, for lack of a better term, than the
    logo has. Where you really see it is in the bowl of the P. It seems odd to me
    how flat that is in the logo, whereas the tops of the O and C don't really flatten
    out at all.

    kick out of your trajan and 'behind the typeface' videos."

  body: "Thanks, Chuck! Sorry, no new animations in the works -- other commitments
    have consumed my life.\r\n\r\nHowever... I've had \"Behind the Typeface: Apple
    Garamond\" in mind for some time. First Apple squeezed her into a size 0, then
    they squeezed her out when they were done with her. Just like with Hollywood actresses,
    body weight and \"typefaces of a certain age\" are issues in the world of corporate
    typography. I look forward to doing this hard-hitting investigative piece someday..."
