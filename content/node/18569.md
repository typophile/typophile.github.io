  done with the font on a MAC and would like to incorporate it into more every day
  use. I am having some issues finding it for  PC.\r\n \r\nDo you have any other suggestions
  as to where I might find this font?\r\n"

  body: "Hi - this \"font\" comes from something called the MacSoft collection, copyright
    CompuWorks 1994. To paraphrase, this collection \"is both good and original -
    but the parts that are good are not original, and vica-versa\". I expect that
    this outfit are out of the type business - a quick search not fruitful, but all
    it's worth - you could use something like TransType to convert it to PC TrueType
    http://www.fontlab.com/Font-tools/TransType/ \r\n\r\nWell done getting design
    and this font into the same paragraph."

      have any experience using it? I sent the link back to my designer to see what
      can be done. \r\n\r\nIf we can't find this font for a PC we will need to look
      for a replacement. \r\n\r\nThanks again! "

    like that font, right down to the weird filled in G. I believe Riverside is freeware
    at several sites. '
