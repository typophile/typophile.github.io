  body: Marlboro-- I guess it was originally a custom lettering. <BR>But I think I&#39;ve
    seen a free font that simulates it. <BR> <BR>McDonald&#39;s ads-- Try Akzidenz
    Grotesk, or some of Grotesques.

  body: This is just an example of how some of this stuff sticks in your mind, and
    pops up when you least expect it. I was looking for a different font ID, and saw
    Red Rooster&#39;s &#34;Hancock Bold Condensed&#34; and thought it looked a lot
    like URW Marlboro &#40;which is apparently really called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/marlboro/"
    target="_blank">Neo Contact D</a>&#41;. I can see now when compared like this
    that the URW font is the identical look to the logo type, but if I was trying
    to &#39;fake&#39; the Marlboro logo, the Red Rooster font was awfully close, and
    might have been the real inspiration for Marlboro&#39;s typeface, since it is
    a digitization of a 1917 Keystone Type Foundry  typeface. I suppose the URW font
    must have come after the cigarette brand was developed. <BR> <BR>None of this
    means anything for this ID, except it shows the lengths this obsession makes me
    go to, just to see how close something else might be. The game called &#39;what
    else could I use?&#39;<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18604.gif"

    implies you may want to be careful when using.

  body: The guy who designed the McLawsuit font actually got threatened with a lawsuit
    from McDonald&#39;s Corporation about a year ago. He had to take the font out
    of his site. Looks like McD&#39;s lawyers didn&#39;t see dafont, eh?
