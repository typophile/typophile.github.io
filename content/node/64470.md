body: looking for a drop cap which can work with some serif typesetting I'm doing.
  3 line single character in conjunction with some DTL typefaces (paradox) and the
  drop cap just comes in so strong. Trajan is the only one I can think of which is
  very light but even that comes in very fat when blown up 300%; anyone have thoughts?
  I'm looking for a light and airy look for the entire piece.

    you need light fonts, instead of really thin ones it's usually better to use \"inline\"
    ones: fonts that have the insides cut out. And if you're using a DTL face, Cristal
    pops into my mind:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/bielerpress/258240026/\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe something even lighter (not\r\nto mention more accessible!) like this:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/lidia/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
