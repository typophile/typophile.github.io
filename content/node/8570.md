  body: The overall look is very nice. The only glyph I doubt about, is the &#39;y&#39;
    letter. I would suggest making both arms equally slanted because now the glyph
    looks a little skewed to the left.

  body: Andriy <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comments, I think you are right about the &#39;y&#39;
    <BR>There are similarities with Neo Sans, I started drawing this font about a
    year ago so hopefully its a matter of great minds thinking alike. <BR>I had to
    change my server, so here is a link to the address. <BR> <BR><a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/c.dickinson40/Alwyn.pdf"

  body: This is great. My only comment would be that the family is a bit biased to
    the light end - any plans to add a black/extra bold weight?

  body: Mmm... As for me, I still don&#39;t like the &#39;y&#39;. Its left arm is
    so falling out of the general image <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR>Also it seems to me that the descender of &#39;Q&#39;
    looks lighter than everything else in Light and Regular styles. <BR>I like the
    weights very much. Overall opinion - great!
