    older thread</a>, Mike Yanega assumes that NuSwift might be the former name of
    what is now available as Swift 2.0.\r\nHere\u2019s a PDF: http://www.gerardunger.com/pdf/swift2.0.pdf\r\n"

    completely different as Mr. Unger confirmed."

  body: "Jan, I doubt that there is a font called NuSwift. That name has been mentioned
    a couple of times on Typophile, but almost always by a single poster, mondoB.
    In <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/29655\">this thread</a>, he wrote \u201CSwift
    and NuSwift, its counterpart with oldstyle figures.\u201D Hence, I assume it is
    just another (unofficial/made-up/wrong) name for Swift 2.0. I posted the link
    to the PDF, so that Mads can confirm if that is the typeface he is looking for."

    Mr. Ludvigsen,\r\nThank you for your interest in our products and services.\r\n\r\nNuSwift
    is a custom corporate font that we have produced for the dutch energy provider
    Nuon; the font is exclusively in use by Nuon and Nuon affiliates.\r\n\r\nIt is
    based upon Swift 2.0 designed by dutch type designer Gerard Unger (www.gerard-unger.com);
    we have also produced these Swift 2.0 fonts.\r\n\r\nAttached I'm sending you a
    type specimen of Swift 2.0; the fonts are available with extended character sets
    (both Latin1 and Latin 2 - central european and baltic), in PostScript Type1,
    TrueType and OpenType formats.\r\n\r\nYou can obtain a licence for the standard
    fonts with us, but we can also provide you with a custom or corporate version
    of the font(s); (custom) font production is our specialty.\r\n\r\nIf you want
    me to make you a quotation, please let me know which styles/ weights you would
    like to have, for how many cpus/ users, and at how many locations/ adresses, if
    more than one.\r\n\r\nMet vriendelijke groet,\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nBien
    \xE0 vous,\r\n\r\nHans van Leeuwen.\r\n"

    to know about the NuSwift. And the reason someone outside Nuon uses NuSwift must
    come down to piracy. Someone should spank the Euroman magazine if things indeed
    as they seem."

    avid collector of typefaces who worked at a certain location of the dutch equivalent
    of Kinko\u2019s, in the mid nineties. The guy swapped all kinds of coporate fonts
    he came by in his job with other collectors. \r\n\r\nI know this because I used
    to moderate a DTP/Quark-forum in that period.\r\n\r\nOT: Maybe the corporate version
    was licensed by LinoType & Mr Unger was not too happy about that.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert
