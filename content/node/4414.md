  body: Romulus Greek is also shown in Fig.27, page 18, of <i>Greek letters from tablets
    to pixels,</i> but the reproduction is pretty poor. The text sample is too poor
    to be of much use, but the figure includes a large showing of the uppercase, apparently
    from van Krimpen&#39;s drawings for R

  body: 'Thanks! Considering the better paper stock, the one in &#34;Greek Letters&#34;
    would have better than LoC&#39;s, but it&#39;s really garbled, unfortunately.
    I was tempted to trace an outline of my LoC scan, but decided to just enlarge
    it then lean on Levels. The edges became rough of course but the color is good.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; Hideous typeface. <BR> <BR>So much so that it&#39;s the first illustration
    I&#39;m using in an essay I&#39;m finishing about the dangers of Latinization&#42;.
    The caption is: &#34;Alleged Greek lowercase xi from Jan vna Krimpen&#39;s Romulus.&#34;  :-&#62;
    <BR> <BR>&#42; To be published first in German. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I&#39;d never heard of Karmeli - I&#39;ll look into it. But wouldn&#39;t you
    call that more of a <i>Romanization</i>, rather than Latinization? Hard to say,
    since there are a number of new symbols added - although that&#39;s in fact been
    the case with some Romanization schemes &#40;like Azeri&#41;. I guess sometimes
    the line is blurred. <BR> <BR>BTW, you know this one? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/34134.gif"

    <BR>Nadine Chahine showed me some photos of Latinised Arabic signage from Dubai,
    some of it very funny, and more interesting than the extreme example you show
    in that people are actually using it.
