body: I went to see the Rick Griffin exhibit at the Laguna Art Museum this weekend;
  it was amazing to see the texture and detail of the originals. And how does he get
  that light in the water? The [[http://www.lagunaartmuseum.org/current_exhibits.html|exhibit]]
  was supposed to close Sunday, September 30, but the catalog and a limited edition
  poster are still available from the [[http://www.lagunaartmuseum.org/cart/|museum
  shop]]. The museum shop also has a variety of Griffin posters that aren't shown
  on the website.

    that was exhibited.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myraltis.co.uk/rickgriffin/galleries1.htm\r\n\r\nCarl
    Rohrs, who did a presentation on Griffin at TypeCon2004, lectured at the museum
    on Griffin's typography. I might try to contact Mr. Rohrs to see if any of his
    presentation is available. Any chance he hangs out here?"

  body: Gus, message me privately with your contact info (phone and email). Carl doesn't
    hang out here, and I know he's been traveling lately. I can send him a message
    with your info and ask if he wouldn't mind getting in touch about the wonderful
    Mr. Griffin.
