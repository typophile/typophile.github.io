body: "Hello\r\nI have been a designer for several years with a great interest in
  typography, but my experience is almost entirely with using existing typefaces...
  i.e. I have no experience drawing my own letterforms. Over the last couple of years
  I've become more and more interested in the work of Herb Lubalin, Tom Carnase, and
  Tony Di Spigna. What I'm particularly interested in learning is hand lettering /
  custom-designing typographic compositions for the purposes of logo design and individual
  type treatments (like the images I'm posting below), rather than designing entire
  typefaces.\r\nI've done a fair amount of research on this kind of custom lettering
  (i.e. I've found tons of examples, which are really inspiring), but I have no idea
  where to start to learn something like this. I'm quite comfortable in Adobe Illustrator,
  but I have no tools or knowledge about actual hand lettering with tools like pen
  and ink. \r\nI have some resources I could devote to this, in terms of taking classes,
  buying books, equipment, etc. but I don't know how to go about it. Does anyone still
  teach this kind of thing? Should I start with calligraphy? \r\nIf anyone has any
  guidance or suggestions, I'd be very appreciative.\r\n(Also, if you think this would
  be ridiculously difficult to learn, tell me.)\r\n\r\nThx,\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AyWzJclyucvuympdYilGtgld_400_4351.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DiSpigna_2_6079.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_1949_6112.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_1954_thumb_4284.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tom_Carnase_01_4153.jpg]"

  body: "A good way to start is through learning the basic letterforms, so calligraphy
    is always helpful. It helps to understand how negative space (at least the space
    between the letters) relates to the letters themselves. But of course the work
    you list here is highly diverse, in letterform and the ability to use it. So yes,
    learning to perfect this takes a very long time.\r\n\r\nAn important key in all
    the examples that you list is understanding contrast. In that aspect calligraphy
    helps as well, since you learn to build contrasts naturally (because of the tool
    you use, the pen, creates this automatically)\r\n\r\nYour question is so 'huge'
    that it's difficult to answer, but if you enjoy hand-lettering, an calligraphy
    course is always nice to do. Of course finding the right calligraphy course is
    also problematic, but I'm sure other people from around New York will have some
    pointers."

  body: "I'm not sure learning calligraphy will be of much help for doing lettering
    like these guys. All of this stuff is what is known as \"built-up\" lettering,
    in which the letters are drawn, not written as in calligraphy. The spencerian
    examples are like a certain kind of calligraphy, using a split nib pen, but I
    highly doubt that these were done that way, in spite of how they look.\r\n\r\nThere
    are as many ways of making built-up lettering as there are people doing it. Here
    are some books I would recommend to get you started:\r\n\r\n<em>Logo, Font, and
    Lettering Bible,</em> by Leslie Cabarga.\r\n\r\n<em>Dangerous Curves,</em> by
    Doyald Young.\r\n\r\n<em>Lettering for Advertising,</em> by Mortimer Leach.\r\n\r\n<em>Lettering
    for Reproduction,</em> by David Gates.\r\n\r\nCabarga's book is probably the most
    comprehensive, and covers using computers for lettering in great detail. Young's
    book addresses design more than technique, but does give you a good idea how he
    worked. The other two predate the digital age and would give you a good insight
    into the way the old guys did it. Mortimer Leach was Doyald Young's teacher.\r\n"

    her own, contemporary style.
