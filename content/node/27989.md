body: I'm about to start working on a logo for a tween girlie brand (in the Limited
  Too/Club Libby Lu/Justice for Girls vein). I'm looking for something pretty bold
  and in your face that would do well on signage, but that isn't so expected. Any
  suggestions of type I could start with would be much appreciated!

    various apparel? I also am having problem visualizing something both girlie and
    in-your-face. My general thoughts are that it be a bold weight casual font but
    not too scripty to be used as signage.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    it has a brand, but Copperplate Gothic?!\r\n\r\nIf you're going for a hand-drawn
    looking wordmark, why not hand draw it?\r\nYou could start with a typeface as
    a model though, say Typing with Rudolf (from Font Bros) and draw over it, \"girlifying\"
    it with curves, tendrils, and general frou-frouishness."

  body: And, yes - - instore signage, exterior signage. I'm doing a whole brand identity...I'm
    hoping for something pretty weighty. Maybe a semi-script? Something with lots
    of style and attitude. Maybe thinking teen, to be aspirational for the younger
    ones?

    nitty gritty details like prices and catalog copy."

    Maybe not bold enough.\r\n\r\nOmnes would be a lot of fun. The face has more character
    than any other rounded sans that I know of. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Asphalt\">Asphalt</a>
    is very bold and it is playful. It plays well with <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Cafeteria\">Cafeteria</a>

    like..com.... no..\r\n\r\nhttp://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/custom/clients/sneak\r\n\r\nbut
    I think your going for a younger market. but Paris in 'That's Hot' is a bit in
    your face. \r\n\r\nSofty girly or condensed hard newspaper headlines in the Akzidenz
    Grot style? "
