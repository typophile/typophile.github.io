  body: "What would be of even greater help is looking into the sources of inspiration
    for these posters. Check out [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_M%C3%BCller-Brockmann|Josef
    M\xFCller-Brockmann]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carson|David Carson]].
    In my opinion, there's far too many people simply emulating styles from ffffound
    without even knowing who they are referencing."
