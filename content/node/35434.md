body: "Hi. Long time listener first time caller.\r\nI would like to receive some feedback
  on this font based on my handwriting.  The original has been on 1001fonts.com for
  a couple of years now but I decided to clean it up a bit to make it more usable.
  I like to think it's worth saving. My intention is to make it look like I actually
  spent time on it while keeping the same feel as the original. It's obvious from
  the sample that I have no design background whatsoever. The capitals are too embarrassing
  to include :)\r\nThanks for your time."

  body: It looks good to me. I like the trail-of-ink look, but it looks more natural
    with the lighter face.

  body: I see what you mean and I do agree. However, the lighter face is only readable
    at 20+ points. In the sample, I had to set it much bigger than the new version
    so as to appear roughly the same size. (I'm sorry I left this information out.)
    Hmm. I should aim for a thickness middle ground. Thanks, popluhv.

  body: I'd correct the too thin lines to avoid user problems at decently small sizes.

  body: "I like it;  I like the juxtaposition between the thick stroke and the very
    thin trailing lines.  That said, I would be curious how it looked when the think
    trails were three-quarters of their current lengt -- it might look better and
    it might look worse. \r\n\r\nThe lowercase s is too tall, I think -- it should
    descend way less and ascend just a bit less. "

  body: "Five months later...\r\nThanks for the feedback. I shortened some of the
    ink trails and kept the 's' (I put an alternate instead).\r\nI named this 'James
    Paul' and is now available on MyFonts.com.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fajardo/james-paul/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jptypophile_5602.JPG]\r\n"
