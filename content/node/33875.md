  body: 'One other possibility: When Adobe first released Eras as a PostScript font,
    they included two versions: The normal version and a modified "low res" version
    which didn''t have the slight slant or subtle stroke tapering. The low res version
    was meant to be used on (then common) 300 dpi laser printers. Perhaps this is
    what they used.'
