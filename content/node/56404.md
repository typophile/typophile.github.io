  know another font that has a nice compressed '@' that i can replace this one with?
  \r\n\r\nor will i have to fudge/draw it? :) \r\n"

  body: "Hmmm... Does Stephen's suggestion mean that Trade Gothic character could
    just be replaced here with Solex?\r\n\r\nI keep looking at these too and wondering:
    wouldn't it be awkward to use them together - Solex for copy; Trade Gothic Condensed
    for headlines for example?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ad augusta per angusta.\"\r\n"
