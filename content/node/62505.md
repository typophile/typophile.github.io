  alphabet and I was wondering if anyone knew of helpful resources, academic or otherwise,
  that could help me along. Specifically I'm looking for info on the early development
  of the characters of the alphabet, particularly the onset of lowercase letters.
  \r\n\r\nI've already got Bringhurst's ETS, Allan Haley's Alphabet and am skimming
  through David Sacks' Letter Perfect.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\njr "
