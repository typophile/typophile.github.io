body: "There's something pure about good type design which attracts without being
  needy or loud. This could go some way to explaining Erik Spiekermann's early involvement
  with hot metal. \"I was given a small printing press (a desktop platen) by a neighbour
  when I was 12,\" he says. Although this kind of gift might not go down well with
  a typical youngster today, this was the late 1950s and the young Spiekermann was
  besotted. \"I taught myself to set type and print,\" he says. It's not so much the
  fact of his enjoyment but its purpose which distinguishes this episode, as he explains:
  \"I used it mainly to print envelopes for letters to prospective girlfriends.\"\r\n<em>in</em>

  couldn't stop smiling when I read that paragraph :)\r\n\r\nThis issue also contains
