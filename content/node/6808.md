  body: I would suggest another of Hermann Zapf&#39;s sans serif designs, since he
    is the designer of Palatino Linotype. Unfortunately for this case, most of his
    designs are serifs. The closest to a sans serif that he has in digital form is
    Optima. <BR> <BR>Optima is his most well-known non-Palatino design, but it isn&#39;t
    <i>exactly</i> a sans serif. <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/54142/optimanova-family.html"

    <BR>If you can wait ahile, Linotype will soon release <b>Palatino Sans</b>, a
    completely new typeface from Hermann Zapf and Akira Kobayashi that was previewed
    at TypeCon in July. <BR> <BR>If you need something now &#40;which you probably
    do&#41;, and Optima doesn&#39;t get your boat sailing, I would suggest any of
    Adrian Frutiger&#39;s designs as a good starting point

  body: Palatino Sans is amazing, really amazing. I think it will firmly establish
    Kobayashi as one of the very top craftsmen in the field. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: '&#62; it sounds like you think that Palatino Sans is more Kobayashi than
    Zapf. <BR> <BR>Yes, and to be honest I think that&#39;s why I like it so much...
    <BR>Plus the fact that it&#39;s &#34;confident&#34; - not a subservient design.

  body: Yes, he did show it at TC. While salvaging conference photos for Joshua &#40;by
    going through my browser cache&#41; I&#39;m pretty sure I saw something - give
    me a minute, or 60. <BR> <BR>hhp
