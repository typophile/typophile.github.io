  body: If you pop the &#34;Gals&#34; font that comes with sample file <BR>you&#39;ll
    notice the outlines match Gill Sans exactly. <BR>&#40;At least to my license of
    Gill Sans from Linotype&#41; <BR>The file says it was created by A.Kustov for
    Type Market Ltd. <BR>in Moscow. It contains some cyrillic too. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll
    also notice Myriad, Officina and Conduit among <BR>the availabe logos. &#40;not
    to mention many others&#41;

  body: I&#39;m listening, just kinda busy today. Well, generally in fact. <BR> <BR>ITC
    is owned by Agfa Monotype. I&#39;m not sure who I&#39;d pass this on to with AMT.
    Maybe Brian Kraimer? <BR> <BR>T
