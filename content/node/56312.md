body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI want to share a thought I had at this moment.\r\nWell,
  I know, I am quite alone here, thinking that digital creation has some major general
  problem that Design in any analog form (hot metal, drawing ecc.) had not.\r\nLets
  take it from another side ;-)\r\nDoes anyone know the problem either in design with
  Bezi\xE9rpoints or also in spacing letters that one unit to the left is too left,
  or one unit to the right, too right? Do you know what I mean? That sometimes it
  seemes that we just can\u2019t find the solution we wanted because we always only
  have the choice between two ways, and not EXACTLY the one we wished to have. I hope
  I explained that.\r\n\r\nNow my thought: In wikipedia (yet German version so it
  makes no sense joining this here) I read that the number that is the result of the
  \u201Cgolden section\u201D is an irrational number (1,618033988...) impossible to
  come close to with two rational numbers (so in the text).\r\nWhat does this actually
  mean?\r\nBingo.\r\nIf one knows that everything we are doing in a digital surrounding
  is down by 1 or 2, i.e. 1+1=2 and so on.. so that we always ONLY have sections (doesn\u2019t
  matter in the end how fine they are) that are divided by rational numbers, or if
  you want 1+1+1 and so on. We can never have 1,618033988...!\r\nThis may be philosophical
  but I truly believe it has some meaning.\r\n\r\nAre we able to do beautiful things
  within a world that isn\u2019t in fact able to catch the irrational (number)?\r\n\r\nSalute\r\nStefan\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For something to be repeated it needs to measured.\r\nA mathematical concept
    like a circle can never be perfectly implemented because we are constrained by
    the media we wish to represent it with. So even if I use a compass to draw a circle
    on paper, I can zoom in further and further until I can see the very un-round
    graphite scattered around the paper pulp. A circle is just an idea.\r\n\r\nUltimately
    we lop-off the bits that are deemed to small to distinguish, which hopefully conveys
    the idea without too much scrutiny. So if you are going crazy over a pixel here,
    a pixel there, maybe it's best to zoom out a little and look at it the way it
    will be presented to another person.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Design isn't about number theory, it's about what looks good and solves the
    problem.\r\n\r\nOr, differently put: applying the golden section won't necessarily
    make a design successful, even if you could be perfectly accurate with the measurements.
    It's a silly thing to get hung up on, IMO."
