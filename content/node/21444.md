  body: Oh my. Are you sure you want to match these? We can find you fonts that emulate
    the same character but are of much higher quality.

    look like these.

  body: i think the header-text is possibly a clumsily manipulated version of an eps
    version of the fedex logo. 'Your pet...' could be anything, you could possibly
    get this result by modifying helvetica/arial in illustrator with gloves on. Handwriting
    font, I'm not sure of

    because this is what I have to do at work. People pay for this kind of things.
    Amazing. \r\nSo there are no matching fonts? Anything similar to the handwriting
    one? Pleeeeez"

  body: "Hi Misa, sorry'boutthis. It seems that everyone was flabbergasted by the
    \"creative\" use of type in your sample. I'm sure nobody wanted to annoy you or
    anything.\r\n\r\nI realise what a difficult situation you are in, having to recreate
    this, but maybe I can help a tiny bit. The main logo is based on <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.107997.0.7&attributes.sampleSize=96&sampleText=PetEx&sampleSize=74\">Helvetica
    Black</a>. The type in the middle I haven't got a clue about, and the comic book
    font suspiciously looks like <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=action_man&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=PET+FOOD+SUPPLIES+%26+GROOMING&nb_ppp=10&classt=alpha\">Action
    Man</a> by Iconian."

    section</a> on Dafont but couldn't find anything. Maybe look for it in other categories
    that make sense to you.

    usually against animal torture and if I had a pet, I'd probably show at least
    some degree of love towards it, so I also wouldn't buy something from a pet shop
    that looks like that... I think you should consult your client/boss a little.\r\n\r\n[The
    comic font is a free one from <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/index.htm\">Apostrophic
    Labs</a> \u2014 I believe it was Komika something (you find the alphabetical nav
    at the top).] <cite>EDIT: Oh, this was already identified. It is \"Action Man\"
    indeed.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe logotype is equivalent to a bad horror movie."
