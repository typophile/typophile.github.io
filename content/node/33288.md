  body: "John,\r\nThanks for posting the link to the white paper.\r\nI was asked a
    few questions offline on this, and I would like to share the answers with folks
    here.\r\n\r\nQuestion 1: Are 'name' table IDs 21 and 22 now \"official\"?\r\n-
    The new \u2018name\u2019 table IDs were agreed upon with our partners, and their
    meaning is now well defined. Font manufacturers are encouraged to test their fonts
    with WPF font model, and I recommend adding the new \u2018name\u2019 table IDs
    for non-WWS families to resolve potential ambiguities and to make sure localized
    names are available for international clients. Please note that WWS families don\u2019t
    need the new \u2018name\u2019 table IDs, they should set the \u2018OS/2\u2019
    fsSelection bit 8 instead.\r\n\r\nQuestion 2: Should Oblique font faces that set
    the new \u2018OS/2\u2019 fsSelection \u201COblique\u201D bit 9 also set the old
    \u201CItalic\u201D bit 0?\r\n- WPF font engine doesn\u2019t depend on this decision,
    but I believe setting the old \u201CItalic\u201D bit is useful for compatibility
    with other platforms that don\u2019t make distinction between Oblique and Italic
    font faces.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are concerns about changing the layout of
    a document when a new \u201CItalic\u201D face is added to a font family that already
    has \u201CRegular\u201D and \u201COblique\u201D variants, or a new native \u201COblique\u201D
    face is added to a font family.\r\n\r\nThere are several things one can do to
    alleviate these concerns:\r\n\r\n1. WPF applications should use FontStyle = \u201COblique\u201D
    or FontStyle = \u201CItalic\u201D along with the appropriate FontFamily value
    (e.g. FontFamily=\u201DMy Font Family\u201D) instead of specifying both family
    and face information in the FontFamily string (e.g. \u201CMy Font Family Italic\u201D
    or \u201CMy Font Family Oblique\u201D.) The former ensures that the application
    behavior will not be affected by Oblique faces that specify \u201CItalic\u201D
    in their subfamily string for compatibility with older platforms.\r\n\r\n2. Since
    adding, removing or modifying font faces on the system can generally change the
    layout of a document, applications or documents that would like to preserve the
    layout of a flow document are encouraged to embed relevant fonts, assuming the
    font licenses have appropriate permissions, of course. WPF has full support for
    font embedding for both fixed and flow documents.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback,
    and best regards,\r\nMikhail\r\n"

  body: "David: <em>Guidelines for font manufacturers\u201D doesn\u2019t contain anything
    that we don\u2019t already do...</em>\r\n\r\nWell, it contains two name table
    fields that didn't previously exist and which are not yet documented in the OT
    spec, so presumably you're not already using those. But if you are only building
    WWS families, you don't need these new fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikhail, if I understand
    the documentation correctly, a WWS family member should have fsSelection bit 8
    set (i.e. to 1) in the OS/2 table. But this is just an efficiency mechanism, yes?
    Because of course there are huge numbers of existing WWS fonts out there that
    do have this bit set. If I understand correctly, these fonts will be subject to
    WPF font differentiation, but fonts with the fsSelection bit 8 set will not be,
    since they will signal to WPF that they are WWS fonts. Is that right?\r\n\r\n"

    body: "John,\r\nyes, your understanding is correct. Setting the WWS flag will
      bypass the font differentiation algorithm, and WPF will trust 'name' table strings
      and 'OS/2' values from the font file without trying to adjust them for consistency.\r\n\r\nBefore
      one ships a font with the WWS bit set, I recommend making sure names and style/weight/stretch
      values in the font are correct and consistent.\r\n\r\nWe tested the WPF font
      selection algorithm with thousands of existing fonts, and it is amazing how
      many fonts out there have inconsistent values. In particular, discrepancies
      between 'OS/2' usWeightClass and preferred 'name' IDs 16/17 (or 1/2 if 16/17
      are not present) are very common. The goal of the WPF font differentiation algorithm
      is to correct these discrepancies for existing fonts, so that they can participate
      in the new font selection model.\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies why the new WWS
      bit is an \"opt-in\".\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have further questions,
      and best regards,\r\nMikhail"

  body: "\"Well, it contains two name table fields that didn\u2019t previously exist
    and which are not yet documented in the OT spec, so presumably you\u2019re not
    already using those\"\r\n\r\nThat is correct, thank you. The main object I have
    is that I do not define my fonts so they can be substituted for (even from within
    the family). The second concern I have is that my fonts never be confused with
    fonts that cannot be removed from the system. (as I continue to chase the need
    so many express every single day, and as was expressed at the last Typecon, Users
    Need Better Font Management Tools from the \"Source of the Problem.\")\r\n\r\nThis
    document, beside ignoring the basics of reportage, (the \"W's\"?) says:\r\n \"Fonts
    should set typographically appropriate and unambiguous stretch, weight and \r\nstyle
    values in the \u2018OS/2\u2019 table.\" (meaning I hope, within a family)...\r\n\"Fonts
    should support the same set of name table localization languages for all faces
    in \r\nthe same font family.\" like anything else is even intentionally possible?\r\n\"Fonts
    are encouraged to include native bold and oblique faces to achieve better \r\nappearance
    compared to the simulated bold and oblique.\" I'm all over this \"duh\" point.\r\n\r\nIt's
    2007 now: my publisher font menu (when I'm composing for print) starts with Arial
    Unicode, Batang, BatangChe, Dotum, FangSong, Guli, Gu l imChe (che(ck) it out,
    lol) Gungsuh, GungsuhChe, MalgunGothic, Meiro... it goes on like this for another
    4-5 inches, before I reach a font name I can \"use\", Agency FB. This problem
    is partly solved if I compose for the web, i.e. all of the non-Latin (and all
    but 11) font families vanish from the menu. (one wonders if non-latin users are
    allowed to publish web documents with non-latin fonts, lol,) but thanks that one
    font menu filter!\r\n\r\nSo while I appreciate the need to catch up for developers
    who might have thought it was a good idea to name or otherwise identify their
    fonts ambiguously or incorrectly design or not, members of a family, 1994 was
    the last year I thought this was a problem for users. (I mean really, John, if
    someone has taken the time to compose a document in NeueHelvetica, do they want
    it to be substituted by Arial!? EVER?) Since then, of course many new problems
    have arisen that don't seem to get any attention. \r\n\r\nFont management, Size
    management, Quality management - ?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDavid Berlow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    If you look at a typical Windows Vista box, and navigate to the system fonts directory
    in Windows explorer, there will be a font named \"Franklin Gothic Demi Italic\".
    The file name is FRADMIT.TTF.\r\n2. The typeface numbering systems recognized
    by the WPF font selection model are indeed the ones used in Frutiger and Univers
    font families. The white paper provides appropriate links: [[http://www.linotype.com/6-1823-6/neuehelvetica.html]]
