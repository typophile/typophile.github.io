  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Okay, I think I&rsquo;ve talked about this before, but I do like Helvetica. That&rsquo;s right, the H word. But while I like its look for certain layout tasks, I&rsquo;ve never actually designed with it before. As in a logo.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my question: can Helvetica be used to communicate a message, without the fact of its usage overriding that message?</p>
<p>I have a property I&rsquo;m developing that combines the word plan and connect in its name. Plannect. Plan as a word feels to me to be rather impersonal, unattached. In fact, a common use for the word is to separate one&rsquo;s self from responsibility for a thing: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m planning on doing that, yes,&rdquo; which means I may or may not do it, depending on how I feel or how dificult it turns out to be.</p>
<p>Hence, Helvetica.</p>
<p>The word connect, on the other hand, is going to stand for friendship and sharing and family. So here&rsquo;s the logo as I&rsquo;ve played with it so far; the two n&rsquo;s seem like the logical place phonetically and graphically to illustrate the act of connection.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me if this is a horrible idea or not?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>my opinion: use of helvetica is fine. i&rsquo;m not hater of the font; if it works, it works.</p>
<p>but i&rsquo;m not crazy about the joining devices. they seem forced and redundant. the word is already joined. a joiner spanning all the letters might work, if you can make it seem natural and not some sort of helvetica/sanskrit hybrid.</p>
<p>but, my unknown friend, the real bad news is that i don&rsquo;t like the word itself. it&rsquo;s awkward and hard to say, creating an impression of mild confusion - exactly the opposite of your intent.</p>
<p>i think because the &ldquo;pl&rdquo; leads you to one mouth form and then the &ldquo;ect&rdquo; suddenly forces another. somehow the n or nn doesn&rsquo;t really bridge comfortably. it also reminds me of too many other arbitrary words: planet, yech, heck, etc. the &ldquo;ect&rdquo; sound is unpleasant when isolated from its familiar source. again, it feels forced.</p>
<p>i suspect i would respond better without the graphic nn bridge being so emphasized.
understatement can be more powerful.</p>
<p>sorry, just my reaction. what about a more elegant design of the two complete words combined ? i know the HEAVYlite combo is used a lot, but something along those lines might work here. best of luck with your venture, however it may be logo&rsquo;d !!!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris,</p>
<p>Thank you for putting so much thought into your critique. I have no problem at all with your distaste for the design and the word. It helps me a great deal.</p>
<p>I agree that phonetically, the word&rsquo;s beginning and ending sounds conflict. But that brings up an argument I&rsquo;ve been having internally: does the word, regardless of phonetic grace, conjure the message that the brand allows people to connect with one another through their plans?</p>
<p>In other words, if a web user were to come across the word Plannect in an article, would it give that reader a plain idea of what the brand&rsquo;s service was?</p>
<p>Normally, I am a huge persuer of aesthetics, and that includes the way words combine in speech. But in this case, I tried to put communication above that.</p>
<p>As for the connectors, I was using Helvetica&rsquo;s own &lsquo;u&rsquo; in condensed form, for just the reason you describe the logo violating: a natural, family of curvatures.</p>
<p>That said, I certainly don&rsquo;t want to turn people off with the name!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I thought &ldquo;Plannect&rdquo; was a portmanteau of &ldquo;planet&rdquo; and &ldquo;connect&rdquo; so I didn&rsquo;t get the &ldquo;planning&rdquo; connotation (it almost rhymes with &ldquo;planet&rdquo;). I also don&rsquo;t like the connectors in the logo. I would suggest trying a connected script rather than trying to add connections to Helvetica.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Lex, if you&rsquo;re looking for connection Helvetica is not the most &ldquo;connected&rdquo; type.
I&rsquo;m with Chris on the redundacy topic, if the &ldquo;connection&rdquo; has a priviledge in the verbal expression, maybe you can focus the graphic into another, complementing concept, and not just make it redundant.</p>
<p>I would suggest either making the verbal more &ldquo;plan&rdquo; like, and show the connection graphically, or viceversa. OR work on a clearer verbal expression and compliment graphically with a different concept (not plan or connect, which is what you do, but a concept based on the particular way you do those things).</p>
<p>As is, maybe the one I like most is C, beacause as I see it, the treatment is in much more accordance to the typeface than the others.
Be aware that the way you are proposing this &ldquo;connection&rdquo;, sacrifies some legibility, just have that in mind.</p>
<p>Also, maybe the particular weight of Helvetica you chosed doesn&rsquo;t favor some movent you are trying to generate. Think for instance in the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; of the lowercase &ldquo;a&rdquo;, it is caracteristic of Helvetica and its better observed in regular to light weights; here it is almost invisible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not against the verbal solutions you came out with, but I do think it could be clearer.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
