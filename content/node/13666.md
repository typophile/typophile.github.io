  (like a \"Disney Dollar\") and after a few hours of researches we still dont know
  what fonts are used on the original \"One Dollar\" bill. Would be great if you could
  have a look at the picture and may help us.\r\n\r\nThanks, Flo.."

  body: "I don't think that the lettering on the one dollar bill is type. I think
    that it is all hand-lettered, that is, invented by the engravers. Maybe they looked
    at some printed specimens to get the letter proportions right, but I don't think
    \ that it is based off of any font.\r\n\r\nFederal is the only thing available
    that matches the effect. But a lot of fonts have the same letter-style (without
    the 3D or hatched effects). Would one of these be ok?\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    has an engraved version not a match but similar and half the price. Alternatively
    you could try <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/engravers/\">this</a>
    and work it over with Illustrator for a cheaper method.\r\nTim"

    banknotes (<a href=\"http://graphicssoft.about.com/b/a/056023.htm\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>).
    \ Adobe seems to have removed the restriction from Photoshop CS2, but you might
    run into problems trying print them out."
