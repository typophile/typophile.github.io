body: There&#39;s something in Adobe Illustrator CS that drives me  <BR>absolutely
  freakin&#39; <i>NUTS</i> and that&#39;s the fact that text anchor  <BR>points seem
  to have lost their &#34;snap to&#34; ability. I hope this is just  <BR>a setting
  and not due to the completely reworked type engine. <BR> <BR>I often have short
  bits of text as independent units &#40;without text  <BR>box&#41; and used to snap
  the anchor point to corner or center  <BR>points of objects. Now this doesn&#39;t
  seem to work anymore. <BR>Anyone knows what happened? I&#39;ve looked in the preferences  <BR>and
  couldn&#39;t find any setting that might be responsible for this.

  body: I did some reading on this in Adobe&#39;s forums. <BR>Other people are pretty
    upset about it too and <BR>it doesn&#39;t seem like there is much of a fix yet.
    <BR> <BR>The way it works is that the arbitrary place in <BR>which you click your
    cursor inside an object is <BR>the spot that snaps to guides, not the outside
    <BR>bounds of the object itself. So, short of <BR>grabbing as close to the edge
    of an object or <BR>text unit as you can, there isn&#39;t much you can <BR>do
    with Snap to Guides. <BR> <BR>Try turning on the Snap to Grid. That is the only
    <BR>way I could get what you are attempting to work.

  body: Well bugger me senseless! When I click in the near vicinity of an  <BR>anchor
    point, I want that precize anchor point to be selected and  <BR>&#34;magnetized&#34;,
    not the near vicinity. What kind of reasoning went  <BR>into that daft decision?!

  body: Doesn&#39;t turning on &#39;Smart Guides&#39; allow you to select the point
    directly? I use them all the time, because they tell you what you&#39;ll select
    and snap to &#40;point, line, intersection, etc.&#41;. <BR> <BR>Cmnd &#43; U should
    turn them on. Although, I admit I use AI 10 at work more than CS at home, so this
    may not be the solution.

  body: Adobe should have stopped at Illustrator 8.0 and simply add the transparency
    and the wrap envelope features. Everything else has completely mocked up the program.
    <BR> <BR>At work I still use OS 9.2 with Illustrator 8, at home I have Illustrator
    10 only because I have OS X only. I de-installed all CS applications &#40;except
    InDesign&#41; because they suck. <BR> <BR>Sorry, end of rant.

  body: 'I have the impression I haven&#39;t made myself entirely clear about  <BR>what
    exactly I meant, so please bear with me while I try to explain  <BR>it in a better
    way. From the Illustrator Help File: <BR> <BR>When dragging objects, the Snap
    to Point command helps you  <BR>align your cursor with anchor points and guides
    in the document  <BR>window. Snapping occurs when the cursor is within 2 pixels
    of  <BR>the point or guide. <BR><i>Important: Snapping alignment depends on the
    position of the  <BR>cursor, not the edges of the dragged object.</i> <BR> <BR>To
    snap to anchor points and guides: <BR> <BR>1. Choose View &#62; Snap to Point.
    A check mark indicates that  <BR>snapping is turned on. <BR> <BR>2. Select the
    object you want to move. <BR> <BR>3. Position your cursor on the exact point you
    want to align with  <BR>anchor points and guides, and hold down the mouse button.
    <BR><i>For example, if you want to align the corner point of a rectangle  <BR>with
    a guide, click down exactly on the corner point.</i> <BR> <BR>4. Drag the object
    to the desired location. When your cursor  <BR>comes within 2 pixels of an anchor
    point or guide, it snaps to  <BR>the point. <BR><i>The pointer changes from a
    filled arrowhead to a hollow arrowhead <BR>when a snap occurs.</i>'

  body: Now point 3 is utter bollocks when it comes to text anchor points.  <BR>When
    I want to have the anchor point of the text snapping to an  <BR>anchor point of
    an object, I click the text object anchor point,  <BR>drag it till it snaps to
    that anchor point. One would assume that  <BR>both text anchor point and &#34;snap-to
    point&#34; are then positioned  <BR>perfectly on top of each other. BUT when I
    enlarge it appears  <BR>that this is <i>never</i> the case, even if I try at 6400%!
    <BR> <BR>If I try it the other way round and drag an object by its anchor  <BR>towards
    the anchor point of the independent text object, it does  <BR>not snap. So this
    means text anchor points have completely lost  <BR>their &#34;magnetic&#34; abilities!
    For what reason? It worked fine and it  <BR>was a really helpful feature. <IMG
