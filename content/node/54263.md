body: "Three designs include: Surrealism, Nouveau Realisme, and Fluxus.\r\n\r\nFor
  Surrealism, I used the painting \"This Is Not A Pipe\" by Rene Magritte. Surrealism
  uses unexpected juxtapositions. Although the painting is of a pipe, Magritte wants
  the viewer to know that it is not a pipe, but a painting of one. Magritte likes
  to repeat this same type of style throughout many works.\r\n[[http://www.artinthepicture.com/artists/Rene_Magritte/pipe.jpeg]]\r\n\r\nFor
  Nouveau Realisme, I found this image that was collaged by the artist Raymond Hains.
  I really liked the use of the primary colors, really draws the eye in. Primary colors
  are so bold, and because the blue is so focused, the spaces where red and yellow
  are used, really brings the viewer in. I also liked that the text was only on the
  yellow and red areas, rather than having it on the blue space. I feel that if it
  were in the blue areas, it would just be too chaotic for the eye.\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hains-TravailleursCommunistes.jpg]]\r\n\r\nFor
  the Fluxus time period, I really liked the cover of An Anthology of Chance Operations.
  I like the interesting way of covering the entire area with text, and experimenting
  with the text in different ways; either by breaking up the word, or by having some
  words in bold, capitalizing different letters, etc. The Fluxus period really encouraged
  a diy, simplistic kind of way, which I tend to enjoy.\r\n[[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/25/Anthology1.jpg]]"
