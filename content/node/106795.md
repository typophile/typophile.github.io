  Worse?\" LP label.\r\nI'm having trouble with the song titles and text below them
  as well as the catalog number, \"331/3 RPM\" and  \"SIDE A\" fonts.\r\nI have found
  similar fonts in my hunting, but nothing that's \"exactly\" the same.\r\n\r\nDon't
  need the (c) & (p)\r\nI'm guessing \"STEREO\" is Helvetica bold?\r\n\r\nThank you
  for you time, any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nTT\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BR_LabelSample_6090.jpg]"
