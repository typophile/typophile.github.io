  to the forums and get some help with a font.\r\n\r\nhttp://idisk.mac.com/jcjdoss/Public/Pictures/Skitch/mm.psd_%40_25__%28M_Flat%2C_RGB_8%29-20090116-114653.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
  is a logo I am working on for my dad.  I like the icon but am getting some hassle
  about the font from other designers.  I'd like something similar to the M's in the
  logo but a lot cleaner than the rest of the text.  Any help is appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: How much cleaner? If you're basically going for a wide sans with a splayed
    "M", [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-sans|Aviano Sans]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/dienstag|Dienstag]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/montag|Montag]] are all nice choices.
