body: So how about it? A subject that I find myself currently debating. That is the
  fact that I am designing a tattoo &#40;for myself&#41;, and trying to decide what
  face I want to use. So far mantinia is winning. I am having some latin text tattooed
  across both of my forearms. <BR> <BR>Anyone have typographic tattoos? or Photos?

  body: I was looking through a book in Foyles earlier this week on Helvetica, and
    noticed that someone had had the name tattooed along their forearms in the typeface.
    I remember thinking it looked &#34;ok&#34; but not much better. <BR> <BR>Problem
    is that it is fairly unlikely that a tattooist will appreciate some of the subtly
    in your chosen typeface, and may have difficulty replicating its dimensions and
    spacing in ink under your skin. <BR> <BR>Also bear in mind that the skin on your
    arm moves and distorts quite dramatically. I have a geometric design that runs
    from shoulder to wrist, and a twist of my wrist distorts the design greatly from
    wrist to elbow. I knew this would happen and designed it in such a way, with the
    help of my artist, to make it part OF the design itself. I think that typographic
    tattoo are inherently going to risk looking <i>wrong</i> due to distortion for
    large periods of time. That is not even taking into consideration how your body
    will age with time. Take this into account, and try transferring a design to your
    arm to see what happens in normal movement. <BR> <BR>Another thing to take into
    consideration is trapping. Ink <i>can</i> spread slightly under your skin over
    time, and different parts of your arm may be liable to spread at different rates
    &#40;this is especially true if you are going to have a multiple sitting with
    your artist - their mood and therefore the execution of their craft will vary
    between sittings&#41;. Be careful therefore when choosing serifed typeface with
    fine detailing, and bear this in mind when deciding how large your tattoo will
    be overall. <BR> <BR>Remember to take into account how your tattoo will fade too,
    especially if you are having shading or colour work. <BR> <BR>Check out this site
    - you will find loads of stories and photos, and I believe there galleries have
    a specific section on typographic tattoos. Those here of a nervous disposition
    may not want to follow the link, by the way. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.bmezine.com/"

    noticed that someone had had the name tattooed along their forearms in the typeface.
    I remember thinking it looked \"ok\" but not much better. \r\n\r\nProblem is that
    it is fairly unlikely that a tattooist will appreciate some of the subtly in your
    chosen typeface, and may have difficulty replicating its dimensions and spacing
    in ink under your skin. \r\n\r\nAlso bear in mind that the skin on your arm moves
    and distorts quite dramatically. I have a geometric design that runs from shoulder
    to wrist, and a twist of my wrist distorts the design greatly from wrist to elbow.
    I knew this would happen and designed it in such a way, with the help of my artist,
    to make it part OF the design itself. I think that typographic tattoo are inherently
    going to risk looking wrong due to distortion for large periods of time. That
    is not even taking into consideration how your body will age with time. Take this
    into account, and try transferring a design to your arm to see what happens in
    normal movement. \r\n\r\nAnother thing to take into consideration is trapping.
    Ink can spread slightly under your skin over time, and different parts of your
    arm may be liable to spread at different rates (this is especially true if you
    are going to have a multiple sitting with your artist - their mood and therefore
    the execution of their craft will vary between sittings). Be careful therefore
    when choosing serifed typeface with fine detailing, and bear this in mind when
    deciding how large your tattoo will be overall. \r\n\r\nRemember to take into
    account how your tattoo will fade too, especially if you are having shading or
    colour work. \r\n\r\nCheck out this site - you will find loads of stories and
    photos, and I believe there galleries have a specific section on typographic tattoos.
    Those here of a nervous disposition may not want to follow the link, by the way.

  body: "I know a lot of people that went to my college who had type tattoos, and
    they are collectively the reason I doubt I'd ever consider getting one.\r\n\r\nCan
    anybody guess what typeface this one's in?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n502517205_4906_9150_3494.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    answer is: it was originally Garamond, but it sure isn't anymore.\r\n\r\nI figured,
    although I'm not terribly anxious to go out and get a tattoo (I'm way too over-cautious
    and afraid I'd regret it at some point) I could not get a tattoo from anybody
    who had <em>less</em> typography sensitivity than me.\r\n\r\nIf I got a tattoo
    with type, and there was a shape or kerning issue, it honestly <em>would</em>
    bother me literally every time I saw it.  I figured if I were ever to get a tattoo,
    because of my high standards I'd want to go to the best tattoo artist I could
    find, and I imagine it would be very very expensive and require me to travel some
    distance to get there.\r\n\r\nFor my conscience's sake, do you know your artist
    has decent typographic sensitivity, enough to accurately reproduce your chosen
    piece?  It's a fact that 40% of a tattoo parlour's business is covering up another
    tattoo artist's mistake.  Those odds are just too high for me."

    who truly deserve the name. \r\n\r\nBtw, this sad \"create\" tattoo looks like
    the ink is too deep in the skin, causing extra bleeding, apart from being crooked
    to begin with \u2026 \r\n\r\nWhat you said about kerning is certainly true. I
    have a very abstract tattoo, actually in the same spot as on this image (inside
    of left wrist), which is basically a line of dots in varying sizes. One dot is
    quite a bit too far on the left, which used to bug me a lot (now it's just 'the
    way it is'); the tattooist had it even further out of line first, & when I complained,
    she protestingly got a ruler, measured it, & then looked at me and said, \"Why
    do you see this? Nobody sees this! It was like HALF A MILLIMETER off!\" I'm not
    going there again.\r\n\r\nThe Helvetica tat looks really nicely done, though.

    use one that's 500 years old?\r\n\r\nAlthough in retrospect I should have used
    the regular weight instead of the semibold. I thought the regular wouldn't have
    been hearty enough to hold up, but the bleeding of the tattoo causes it to thicken
    out a bit. So I guess I should have used the regular weight of the caption cut.
    But retrospection does not equal regret. I probably would have more regretted
    not getting a tattoo because I was agonizing over the font."

    for others too.\r\n\r\nMy number one suggestion would be to talk with your artist.
    (or better yet, several artists to see who has the best understanding of type-centric
    pieces) Take several printed examples of the type you're considering and explain
    to them what it is about each typeface that you especially like. This way they
    can tell you how it's not really going to be possible to keep the integrity of
    the very fine lines in Bodini at 12pt but that perhaps going larger or with a
    similar, slightly heftier face will give a similar outcome.\r\n\r\nTrust a good
