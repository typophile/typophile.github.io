body: "A recent medical study compared subjects spending the same amount of time in
  front of a computer: one group did so with relatively few interruptions, the other
  splitting the time into smaller segments. Those who spent long periods seated at
  the computer had a worse record for heart conditions, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd today another
  study in the news, comparing sitting with standing. Needless to say, you're better
  off standing.  (Winston Churchill, he of the cigars, brandy, and 90-year lifespan,
  is the poster boy for standing \u2014 he wrote all his many books standing, and
  pacing, at a lectern.)\r\n\r\nSo if you're inclined to hunker down on a font (or
  whatever) for many hours at a time, beware.\r\n\r\nI can also add my personal experience.
  I always thought I was pretty fit\u2014worked out regularly, ate sensibly, good
  body/mass index. But last year I had a coronary problem (thankfully fixed with a
  stent), which I now attribute to all those dusk-to-dawn sessions at the computer.
  \r\n\r\nSo my advice, take lots of breaks. And get your 8 hours sleep."

  body: I don't know how much is from sitting in front of a computer (before that
    a drawing board) or just bad family history on my part. In 1995 (at age 51), I
    had a quadruple bypass and in 2007, I had 4 stents put in after a minor heart
    attack.  Having said that, I am the first male member of my family to live beyond
    the age of 55. Thanks to modern medicine. My older brother had his first heart
    attack at 39 died at 51, my father at 55, his father at 52 and even his mother
    at 48. All were heart related. I still do my fair share of 16 hour design sessions
    in front of the computer but I don't have anywhere near the stamina I did even
    5 years ago.  I just completely loose track of time when I am working and often
    forget to eat.

    using a computer is that a lot of your distractions from work are on the computer
    also, so you might be having a break from working but you are still sitting in
    the same place. I don't spend much time with a computer as I draw on paper, and
    breaks from that tend to involve doing things in the garden or going for a swim.
    Also, I work part-time in a bookshop so I am always standing there, although that
    is a possible cause of some of the foot problems I have."

    it. My back is happier and, as I work at home, I can crank the music and dance
    like an idiot to get a bit of movement back into my day. \r\n\r\nStudies over
    the past year or so have shown that there's no magic chair...it's the act of sitting
    that's hurting us. So, standing, at least for part of the day, is going to be
    a good thing.\r\n\r\nOn my to-do-list is to rig up a laptop stand on the treadmill
    to make good use of the hour-long conference calls I'm on. "

  body: "Standing is better than sitting, but frankly I'm a bit dubious about that
    first study mentioned. Standing provides very minimal exercise, and it certainly
    isn't the kind of aerobic exercise that benefits the heart. I wonder if maybe
    the study just found a correlation, rather than an actual cause-and-effect relationship.\r\n\r\nIf
    the two groups in the study were identical in every respect other than the frequency
    of standing, the only medical connections I can see offhand might be 1) a possible
    reduction in blood clots that can be caused by long periods of sitting (deep venous
    thrombosis), or 2) a reduction in pressure ulcers (often called \"bed sores\")
    which are caused by remaining in the same position for long periods of time, and
    can sometimes lead to more serious health problems, especially with folks who
    already have health problems (elderly, diabetic, paralyzed, etc).\r\n\r\nDon't
    get me wrong, standing is a good idea. I'm just a bit dubious that standing, by
    itself, can be statistically linked to a reduction in cardiac disease."

    At 82, dad's still going strong, flying sailplanes, which he began at age 70.\r\n\r\nMy
    mom smoked for 47 years, then in 1996, woke up 3 days in a row with pain in her
    chest. My dad told her it was her heart. She said it couldn't be, because she'd
    always had low cholesterol and clear x-rays. But on the third day of waking up
    like that, she had my dad take her to the hospital. The admitting physician said,
    \"Well, you don't usually have had pain like that without some damage to the heart,
    but I'm not a cardiologist.\" After a cardiologist ran tests, he said, \"I don't
    know how you did it, but you beat the odds. No damage to your heart, but you have
    one artery blocked 90%, and one 55%.\" Angioplasty took care of it. My mom asked
    how it is possible for her to have great cholesterol numbers, but have blockage.
    The doctor replied that they hadn't connected the dots yet, but had a staggering
    amount of information pointing to a link between smoking and heart disease in
    people with good cholesterol. Remember, this was '96--they probably have it figured
    out now.\r\n\r\nWe all have to go some time from some cause, butwhy rush it, or
    make the quality of our own lives less than what it could be? That said, I suppose
