  from [[Linotype]] as part of their [[Platinum Collection]], was designed by [[Werner
  Schneider]] and [[Helmut Ness]].\r\n\r\nIn 1988, Schneider designed a proposal for
  a universal European signage typeface. This typeface was adapted together with [[Helmut
  Ness]] of [[Fuenfwerken]] at the [[Fachhochschule Wiesbaden]] in the late 1990s
  for use in the new Munich transit system. Ness, among others, would go on to completely
  redesign the city of Munich's transit authority system. Vialog would be used for
  everything, from large signage down to tiny print on pocket-sized maps.\r\n\r\n<a
