  body: 'Answers to three main questions, as well as any other comments would be appreciated:
    <BR> <BR>1.&#41; Is the Typeface too distracting? :/ <BR> <BR>2.&#41; What do
    you think of it&#39;s balance, reducability, recognizability.. <BR> <BR>3.&#41;
    Does it feel Spanish or Baroque to you? <BR> <BR> <BR>Please really let me have
    it in this critique. I&#39;ve never been good at logos and I need to learn the
    hard way. My professors are way too nice and I need some harsh words from astute
    individuals. <BR> <BR>Thank you!'

  body: Hi there, <BR> <BR>I guess I&#39;m not the kind of astute person you&#39;re
    looking for to critique this, but my personal opinion is that the vector ornament/logo
    is very centered and symmetrical, but your choice of the enlarged caps kind of
    breaks that symmetry, I&#39;d be interested to see what it looks like in uniform
    caps &#40;all of the same either totally small caps or all caps&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not too sure if the typeface says &#34;Spanish Baroque&#34; either, but then again
    I haven&#39;t seen a font that says &#34;Spanish Baroque&#34;. I like the colors
    you&#39;ve used but if I had composed this I would have shrunk the text to about
    85-75% of it&#39;s current sized and moved it a little closer to the graphic,
    however that may be personal taste with tight compositions. <BR> <BR>Hope this
    helps in someway. I know what it can be like to work in a feedback vacuum!

  body: Linus, <BR> <BR>Thanks so much for your comments! I would have to agree with
    you about the type being too large. I actually did this on accident- I had a previous
    version with smaller type that got mixed up before I posted.  <BR> <BR>As far
    as the typeface goes, I don&#39;t think it needs to be Spanish Baroque as long
    as it complements the design. I actually want the whole mark to be very clean,
    simple, and contemporary. The challenge with this is that everything from the
    Baroque era is very ornate and complicated. My struggle is going to be one of
    balance I think.

  body: If you are keeping the design/logo above the type I would suggest keeping
    to simpler forms below for better contrast with the form above. If you were integrating
    them that would be different. It&#39;s an iteresting shape above &amp; works to
    suggest a stage in a way - interesting, albeit baffling. If you do keep the Small
    caps thing Loose some of the space between L &amp; O in &#39;Los&#39;!

  body: Sarah, make a decision what is most important the name or the dingbat. Right
    now they are equal importance. Create a level of importance to each element.

  body: I tend to agree with Daniel. Perhaps you shouldn&#39;t worry about a Spanish
    baroque typeface and instead select a type that is more &#34;neutral&#34; -- possibly
    allowing your mark to be more dominant &#40;and baroque&#41;.
