  body: "The upper case font is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/divine/\">Divine</a>
    from T-26. The lower case lettering is quite similar to Mark Simonson's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/felt-tip-roman/\">Felt
    Tip Roman</a>, but not identical. Brian Willson's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/3ip/oak-street/\">Oak
    Street</a> also has a very similar feel.\r\n\r\nThose were the closest I found
    in the Script Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
