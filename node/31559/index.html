<p>I just graduated from a graphic design school that heavily stressed art history and typography, so don&rsquo;t get me wrong &hellip; I love type and type history. But my question is this: in our visually hyperstimulated culture, how important is the background of a typeface in its use? Would it really matter if I used an Arts &amp; Crafts typeface to promote a large factory? In your experience as typographers and designers, how much does the message of the client and the history of the type line up?</p>

<p>It depends on the factory. Using Eccentric for a factory that produces semiconductors would lead to some really stupid-looking marketing materials.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hmmm&hellip; <em>How relevant is type history?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so tempted to write an article on this, but it&rsquo;s Sunday and we&rsquo;re going out to dinner soon. So here are a few responses off the top of my head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Designing and/or using type is not very different than any other applied art (fine art, music, literature, etc.), cultural or professional craft. Observers and critics often group or <em>define</em> the movement or style, while the individuals who created them often pursue what they feel is their own course of development. Some studied history or the work of their predecessors and some did not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re genius enough, you need little to stimulate progress or a line of development. If you&rsquo;re like me, I needed to see and learn as much as possible in order to move confidently forward. With that said, <em>history</em> of any sort can contribute to your overall knowledge and awareness of apsects that it would take years to accumalte from individual practice and exploration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>how important is the background of a typeface in its use?</em>
It&rsquo;s not as important as understanding it&rsquo;s relevance and potential for contemporary usage. What origially worked as a superlative text or titling face during the eighteen-hundreds or mid-nineteen-fifties is less important than it&rsquo;s impact in current usage. In other words, you can draw from the past if it can influence today&rsquo;s viewers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Understanding certain details about the historic development of type can give you a higher awareness or aesthetic sense in regards to specific typographic solutions or refinements. Few graphic designers under the age of thirty even know that many type styles were originally modified in design for specific point sizes or ranges. Today, using a single font for small, mid-sized sub-heads and titles produce much less of the highly balanced and refined typography seen in quality hot-metal book publications. Knowing this history and then training your eyes to <em>see</em> such refinements can only lead to improving your skills as a professional.</p>

<p>Its the same with types.
When I saw one of Dan Reynold&rsquo;s fonts, I said &ldquo;Typical american&rdquo;.
And if you know (I am sure you know) which type is coming out of which epoche, you can learn a lot of this types. About the idea of its designer and about what it told the people who saw the adds and publications produced by these types.</p>
<p>Everytime I identify a letterpress font for someone, I tell him the foundry, the year of its first production date and its designer. For me its a general part of the information I was asked for.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">knowing the history of a typeface (both it&rsquo;s usage and design) gives us designers a good place to start when considering how audiences will perceive our message. for me, it helps balance out my personal tastes with something more objective and proven. most of the associations people have with typefaces comes out of their history.</div>
