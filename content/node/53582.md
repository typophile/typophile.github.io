  Dr. Suess's evil twin brother, Dr. Sinister! It just caught my eye when I was looking
  around the library. I also like that they used the paint brushes and pencils to
  make the XX's to represent the roman numeral 20 .. that's pretty neat-o. Do you
  think they used the pilgrim hat to symbolize America? hm... Either way it's got
  some really cool stuff in it if anyone wants to check it out, it's in the art section.
