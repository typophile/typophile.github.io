<div class=commentbody>Hi Uli. Thanks for this informative post. (Perhaps you can check out an old thread to answer a couple of questions I posed: http://typophile.com/node/36478?page=1 )
As for James Montalbano's statement: From what I can tell, most of the people making fonts are "garagistes" - passionate amateurs - and the likelihood that they will ever produce anything of great value is small. Just look at the flood of dross which is MyFonts and I think you'll agree that while there is money to be made in typography, that's not the place to do it. Unless you are the director of MyFonts, in which case you probably do very well on the basis of economies of scale.
Doesn't mean that people shouldn't keep doing it. It's like being in a bar band; you can make pocket money doing it and have a lot of fun, but most bar bands are simply not interesting enough for "the big time".

I don't know if you care, but the link to Terminal Design on your user info page is messed up a bit, it seems. It links to:

As an aside, I love Tangent. Although the kerning on the sample page seems to be turned off. See 'ly' in sample below.

<div class=commentbody>Dennis, the missing http:// appears to be an issue with many profiles on Typophile.com: my guess is that it’s an artifact from the migration from the old forum system to the current one since you see it mostly on old profiles (James has been a member for 4 years 11 weeks at the moment). </div>

Its my feeling that the majority of TypeCon should address this issue. The business side of type always gets short-changed at TypeCon. 4 hours of Dwiggins vs 45 minutes of Q&A with Frank Martinez.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm sure there are many, many fonts on say, MyFonts that will never 'bring back' $600, and others may take between four and twenty years, so to be conservative I would say the average is forty-two years.

<div class=commentbody>I'm going to state something very obvious here, although I'm not a type designer, but a type user, and enthusiast... the amount of money you make is dependent upon the typefaces you offer. The independent foundries and designers that do well, are doing well because they are producing something that people want. You can make money doing almost anything if you do it well. Look at LucasFonts. How much do you think he has banked off his Thesis family? I remember getting a specimen back in '95 and thinking it was an awesome achievement, and it is. It is still going strong. Look at H&FJ, their typefaces are solid designs that are seen everywhere.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>On average, how much time on the market does it take for a font to bring back six hundred dollars?</em>
There are so many variables (IE a single sloppy font that took a day to make or a complex family that took years) The time spent often shows in the design. Also the end price, if the font is $600, then one sale does it)
Bottom line is, some fonts sell and some do not. There is only so much market research and weighing investment on return that can go into it. Most people make fonts to fill a perceived void (in the type world in general or personal achievement). Going into it for financial gain is a very risky proposition but not unattainable.
I am curious how the seemingly arbitrary figure of $600 came up?

<div class=commentbody><em>and don’t give it all away to a foundry or reseller.</em>
I agree with the foundry part, although it might not be a bad way for some to start out in the business.
However, I don't see what's wrong with having distributors. Typically they take 50%, but they provide access to markets a foundry will not find otherwise.
Also consider the increasing (and long overdue) sophistication of online retailers, driving traffic to their sites. It takes a heck of a lot of effort to generate traffic to one's own site for direct sales, and to provide constantly refreshing content.
I'd say that in future things will go well for foundries that are able to co-ordinate font development, direct retail sales, and integrate marketing across the board with a variety of distributors -- which is a pretty straightforward business model going way back in time.
I have a number of distributors. I do find it difficult to produce a campaign they all can use. Everyone has their own standards for things like the size of banner ads, and most do not even use co-op (supplier-generated) marketing material, which seems to me a missed oportunity, because everyone benefits from synergy.</div>
