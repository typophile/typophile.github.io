body: "After utilising a graphically-intensive (and indeed slightly overwhelming)
  style for my <a href=\"http://www.paulwilsdon.com\">portfolio</a>, I've decided
  to go with something in line with <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com\">ALA</a>
  or <a href=\"http://www.markboulton.co.uk/\">Mark Boulton</a> for my latest version.\r\n\r\nI've
  asked around, and some have compared it to a letter rather than a website, but I
  think it'll make a nice and refreshing change for the layout.\r\n\r\nThe content
  requirement of the site is as any other portfolio: Bio, Work, Blog and Contact -
  however - there is a 52-week <em>daily</em> entry to be filled for my industrial
  placement for University, and I'm attempting to make it as legible as possible (something
  which definately does <strong>not</strong> happen with the current style).\r\n\r\nAny
  comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and with that I'd like to
  introduce myself as one of the latest additions to this fantastic resource's arsenal
  of designers!\r\n\r\nIt seems the file could not upload using T's submission tool
  - the image is hosted at <a href=\"http://img178.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture1sy7.png\">Imageshack</a>\r\n\r\nRegards,
  \r\n\r\nPaul."

  body: "So is this the updated site we are looking at? I'm very inexperienced at
    web design, but from a general design perspective, you need to establish a grid
    and some better hierarchy.\r\n\r\nYour text flows across the entire page, making
    it difficult to read. That would be the first thing I would address.\r\n\r\nDavid"

    it even thinner) background. You need a lot more black-(uhm, white)space.\r\nThe
    texttype is to small and the lines are much toooo long. \r\nAnd i don't get why
    you format the navigation like this.\r\n\r\n "

    is indeed the old version.\r\n\r\nI've established a grid and used less neon-esque
    colour for the <a href=\"http://img178.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture1sy7.png\">latest</a>
    version.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\nPaul"
