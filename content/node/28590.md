body: So what's the deal with Arial Rounded? It's now part of the Mac OS X system
  fonts, is MS planning to make this a standard font for Windows users, too? Are we
  going to (finally!) see a new font to use with web sites? Or was Apple just too
  cheap to license Helvetica Rounded from Linotype?
