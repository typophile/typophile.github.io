body: "I'm using avant garde as purely display. small uses of the extra light weight
  and majority usage of the extra black/bold. My keypoints for using this is for it's
  geometric simplicity in the letters I've used (mostly e, c, o etc)\r\n\r\ni'm looking
  for a good serif pairing to use as body text. any thoughts? i'd post a pic of the
  mark but it's a dead giveaway as to the company it's for\r\n\r\n_will"
