  Horne</a> ladies. They want somthing a bit more special than the <a href=\"http://www.theletterheads.co.nz/content/thework/eh_02.html\">seasonal
  flyers</a>, and what they are using at the moment is, well, terrible. So I think
  I have it nailed, I am just wondering whether I am on the right track.\r\n\r\nAll
  feedback will be taken into consideration!\r\n\r\nKa kite.\r\n\r\nKris.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Kris,\r\n\r\nThis is <strong>really</strong> nice.\r\n\r\nThe colours and
    the fades into and out of the aubergine are really neat, and the shapes that bracket
    the shop name at the ends of the banner are great.\r\n\r\nTo my eye the dotted
    marquee looks a bit too intense and I notice the lower right hand corner, probably
    because the distribution of the dots kind of jams up there and the upper-left
    is a bit off too.\r\n\r\nThe only other things is that the centre bundle/burst
    feels a little too stiff. I see how it derives from the vertical stripes in the
    other designs but for some reason it feels to me either not curved enough, or
    perhaps needs to be more vertical terminating in almost a  hook?\r\n\r\nOut of
    curiosity too, I was wondering what criteria you're using to choose whether you
    use the swash R or the short-legged R? Using the swash R may add somethng \"...a
    bit more special than the seasonal flyers\"* maybe.\r\n\r\n*These are great too.\r\n\r\nJon"

  body: "Thanks Jon! This was created in Illustrator CS, and I usually make the flyers
    in InDesign, because the dots are much more even for some reason. They are too
    intense, I am yet to match them to the others.\r\n\r\nI think I see what you mean
    about the centre lines. I will try to soften/curve them.\r\n\r\nThe swash R? I
    use that purely when it feels right. It felt right for the summer flyer, but not
    the winter flyer. Don't ask me why! I am also cautious of over-using it, as it
    is integral to the original EH logotype. In this voucher, it looks odd, the words
    \"GIFT VOUCHER\" need to align horizontally, beacause they are in such a tight
    strip.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback! \r\n\r\nThe rest of you lurkers could leave
    a comment, that would be nice\u2026\r\n\r\nKris."

    that's required.\r\n\r\n<em>I am also cautious of over-using it, as it is integral

    can see you're right.\r\n\r\n<em>This was created in Illustrator CS, and I usually

    have always noticed this tendency on patterned lines in Illustrator which I have
    used since version 5.5. You may find yourself back in Indy to do the dots. The
    other alternative is to divide the line legth by the width of a dot and gap and
    then place a dot, copy it to its new position and cmd-d it across the width.\r\n\r\nThat
    is, if you're obsessive compulsive about that kind of thing, which I am sure you're
    not, as it would be unhealthy. &lt;grin /&gt;\r\n\r\nDo show your progress, I
    am interested in your work.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJon"

  body: "I find the elegant shapes combined with the colour choice, type design and
    gradation very appealing. The dots are distracting for me, perhaps because they
    don't have the gradation, or maybe they are superfluous or too frequent or the
    wrong shape. I also expect to see some kind of denomination, is that too commercial
    for the client's position? \r\nTim"

    Luckily I am not, and don't spend countless hours pondering the signifiance of
    dotted lines, whether the printer will get the damn colour right, adjusting the
    letter-spacing, asking people what they think, changing the gradient from this
    to that, apple- \u2018s\u2019 ing just in case, changing stroke weights from .5
    to .3, and finally stressing about whether anyone cares about a damned voucher
    in the first place. No, not obsessive in the slightest! \r\n\r\n\u201CThe dots
    are distracting for me\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\nYeah, I think that I made them too big
    in this instance. There is a usual size that I make them, and they aren't distracting
    at all. Rather they add a certain \u2018plink\u2019 to the final effect. \r\n\r\n\u201CI
    also expect to see some kind of denomination\u201D\r\n\r\nI know what you mean.
    But the ladies tend to write the amount on it, which  will be on the back (as
    yet undesigned), as they don't write out too many vouchers in a year. But Having
    said this, I may ask them whether they would consider creating a range of denominations\u2026"
