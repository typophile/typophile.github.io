  body: given that it's an illustrators site, it looks like handwriting, and each

  body: "I thought that at first, bu the E's look very similar, so do the I's and
    maybe the A's too. Looking through his portfolio it seemed that he used it consistently
    in several other places, which made me think that it may digital. \r\n\r\nIt reminds
    me a lot of the font \"Tree\" which has several interchangeable characters.\r\n\r\nthanks
    again for the comment!  "
