  body: "rockberto... All your threads have similar titles... It would help everybody,
    yourself included, if you used titles that were a bit more descriptive.\r\n\r\nFor
    example, this one could have been titled, \"Help identify heavy metal blackletter\"...
    \r\n\r\nJust a friendly suggestion. And please take the time to read the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq\">Type
    I.D. Board's FAQ</a>, too."

    text in your image says. For example, this could have had the title \"Erik Norlander\".\r\n\r\n

    you have already created.  :-)
