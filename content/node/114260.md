  body: "Unless you've made arrangements with the original author or current copyright
    holder, or the font license allows for this kind of reuse and modification, you
    have to do some inspirational cleansing to avoid running afoul and making a plagiaristic
    copy.\r\n\r\nErik Spiekermann said something about this on these forums some time
    ago. I'll paraphrase what I remember, but I welcome correction. Really, paraphrasing
    what you remember is at the essence of what he said.\r\n\r\nStudy the font you
    intend to revive in great detail. Examine whatever existing copies you can find.
    Sketch out the glyphs by hand, and become familiar with every curve and corner.
    Then, lock it all away for a month. Don't look at it. After the time has passed,
    sketch it out, from memory, on paper, without looking at your references. Build
    your font from these sketches. \r\n\r\nI'm sure I left out a step or some philosophical
    point or something. Apologies for what I got wrong."

  body: "There is a continuum from the outright illegal -- copying and editing digital
    outlines generated by a computer program without the permission of the copyright
    holder either via the license or by individual arrangement -- to the perfectly
    legal -- reviving or adapting a printed sample in a foundry specimen book from
    the 19th century. For everything else laws vary from country to country. There
    are a few legal cases for guidance but most situations are not properly resolved.
    Best to be cautious. If in doubt get competent legal advice that applies in your
    jurisdiction.\r\nDon"
