body: "Hi folks, \r\n\r\nSomeone has asked me if Wexford (see attached sample from
  the Bauhaus Guide) has ever been digitized. That sample was shown in the 1985 Phil's
  Photo \"Homage to the Alphabet\" book. Apparently it was used back in 1981 for a
  company logo that they want to update with the same typeface, if possible.  I did
  a number of Google searches, and only found an unrelated font and a couple of non-vendor
  links. I'm wondering if OptiFonts ever digitized it, or if an amateur version exists
  under another name?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help you can provide.\r\n\r\n- Mike[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WexfordXB_5725.gif]"

    regarding this particular font.\r\n\r\nSearching the web for it, I found this
    website: http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/revival/index.html\r\n\r\nClassic fonts
    digitalized, among them Wexford! However, I couldn't find any information regarding
    purchasing/downloading these beauties. Perhaps another member can shed some light
    on this?"

  body: "Daylight fonts is run by a person named Shinya who has written to me in the
    past for information about some of the fonts. I have just sent an e-mail to find
    out more about how fonts can be purchased/downloaded. One of the purposes of that
    site according to Shinya is to be a reference guide for some of the obscure fonts.
    Apparently he/she is also digitizing some of them to revive the designs.\r\n\r\n

    work for Jansson (the invitation company) and they had it there. I have attached
    a sample of it :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eton_4283.jpg]"
