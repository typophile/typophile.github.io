  body: Adam - I think those tips are great. The problem is that they are  <BR>on
    an MSN Groups page which &#40;besides spawning an enormous <BR>URL that pushes
    you to use Tiny URL&#41; requires that you register <BR>as an MSN user and sign
    up for the group. This is just lame. <BR> <BR>Basic tips and instructions for
    FontLab should appear on the  <BR>FontLab website and in the FontLab manual. I
    hope they will be  <BR>as wise about this as they were when they brought you on  <BR>board.
    Perhaps you can make better use of their <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/faq.html"
    target="_blank">FAQ page</a>.

  body: 'Here is &#40;I hope&#41; a quick answer: <BR> <BR><b>1. In Illustrator, set
    your ruler zero point to the intersection of the baseline and the left sidebearing
    of the character you want to copy.</b> The zero point in Illustrator corresponds
    to the base point in the FontLab glyph window. The default zero point in Illustrator
    is the upper left corner of the page. If you leave it that way, your artwork will
    be placed below the baseline in FontLab. <BR> <BR><b>2. Point coordinates in Illustrator
    are converted directly to em units in FontLab, rounded to whole numbers</b>. For
    instance, if you want your cap height to be 500 em units in FontLab, make it 500
    points tall in Illustrator before copying. If you have to scale your artwork after
    pasting into FontLab &#40;especially if you have to scale up&#41;, you will get
    rounding errors and distortion, so it&#39;s best to scale it to the right size
    in Illustrator first. The thing to remember is that Illustrator is accurate to
    1/1000 of a point but FontLab can&#39;t work with any measurement smaller than
    one em unit, equivalent to 1 point for imported Illustrator artwork.'

  body: Er.... guess it didnt work that good after all.. <BR>Pasting from FontLab
    to Illustrator works fine, the size in em-units corresponds directly to points.
    But the opposite &#40;Illustrator to FontLab&#41; makes the letter enlarge almost
    twice as much ....?

    crash....
