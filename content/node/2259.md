  body: It could have been made from Avenida, which has the flattened stroke endings
    &#40;see <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces6.html" target="_blank">Bauhaus
    Guide</a>&#41;, creating the A from an inverted V and backing the arms of the
    E into the stem &#40;using outlines in a graphics application&#41;. BTW, notice
    how much Font Diner&#39;s &#39;Guest Check&#39; looks like Newport Classic with
    the G chin height changed?

  body: Mike, Avenida&#39;s G &amp; N would need to be modified as well. <BR> <BR>Quite
    right, I see, about Guest Check, um, &#34;borrowing heavily&#34;, shall we say,
    from Newport classic.
