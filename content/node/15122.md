body: Hi, I'm a newbie here although been a member (watching occasionally) for nearly
  2 years. Don't even know if I am posting this topic in the right place, if not then
  you'll have to forgive me... I just acquired a copy of FontLab and to be frank with
  you, I am completly lost in there but I'll sort it out. I was wondering if some
  of you would be kind enough to answer a few questions. What sort of timeframe am
  I looking at to complete a good quality font, let's say in 'Latin 1' to reduce the
  size of it. I know this could depend on several different things, but an approximate
  time in hours would be scary enough. Since I often read critics about typefaces,
  most of the people giving their personnal opinions about changes that should be
  made to certain characters appear to be experienced designers, then what style of
  fonts is most likely to be a good one. If you have a font name that is a good example
  this would greatly give me a head start to the design I should look forward to.
  How should a font be designed, by this I mean character witdh compared to certain
  ones, let's say the 'a' compared to the 's' and such, in caps and lowercases. Thanks
  for all the help, Reg
