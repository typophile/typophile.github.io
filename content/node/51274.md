body: Hey guys, I've recently been getting more into font collection and would love
  to know what you guys think are some of the best foundries. I really like the Hoefler
  & Frere Jones work and have purchased a couple of there fonts. Anyone else have
  any favorites that I might be interested in checking out?

    looking to use the fonts or just collect them? Someone who for example might collect
    spoons, would approach things differently from someone who was primarily interesting
    in eating soup. "

  body: Yes, I'm using them in a variety of web/print work. I would love to build
    a strong library, from all the classics to new modern foundries. I have a bit
    of a modernist style but also really respect the classics.

    it's more useful to start by looking which \"foundry\" is offering the best conceived
    digital typefaces. If you are looking fos strictly typographical styles, I would
    start by looking at which types you like more, and then see which renditions and
    stylizations are among the best available as digital type.\r\nFor example, with
    Garamond types, or Jenson and Caslon, you may have a lot to evaluate, and then
    see what works best as a digital version, which is more carefully rendered, which
    is more solid, or more complete in terms of glyph coverage, etc."

    up in your life every now and then and eat pancakes for dinner? Any opinions on
    the unspoken, underlying paternal theme existing in the complex Batman-Robin relationship?\r\n\r\nOh,
    wait a minute ... ah, I get it now. Silly me - all you wanted was for people to
    provide you with names of their favorite type foundries because you've got a developing
    interest in typography! I wonder what made me think you were looking for a intrusive
    psychological profile?\r\n\r\nAlright, so then just the foundries: Mr. Shinn up
    there already has provided a great start. I would especially recommend checking
    out \"Brown\" and \"Worldwide,\" my personal favorites there.\r\n\r\nSome others
    to see, with special emphasis placed size, quality and most of all, diversity:\r\n\r\nwww.textaxis.com\r\nwww.gestalten.com\r\nhttp://andreubalius.com\r\nhttp://fontsmith.co.uk\r\nwww.daltonmaag.com\r\nhttp://blambot.com\r\nhttp://www.felicianotypefoundry.com\r\n\r\nThese
    will get you started; if you've seen 'em, raise the flag and I'll toss out some
    more. Disclaimer: These are not my \"favorites\" nor do they represent what I
    consider the \"best\" ones; however they are all very good and not what I'd call
    particularly mainstream like, for example, \"fonts.com.\" Let me know what you
    find."

  body: "Well, with that term I tried to compensate my lack of immediate expression
    in English language\u2026\r\nI used it to describe the state of typography (simply
    seen as the mechanization of the process of setting lettering, not as \"fine typography\"
    as commonly used) as it was hit by the tornado of the so-called \"digital revolution\".
    Many designers (mostly graphic designers) generated a true \"avant-garde\" movement
    on international scale, as type design stopped to be \"a brave and arcane business\"
    in the hands of a few, a notion expressed by Matthew Carter in an interview around
    1993.\r\n\r\nHmm\u2026 Try to locate the article \"The Digital Wave\" by Robin
    Kinross, from an old issue of Eye Magazine, to look at Rick Poynor's articles
    in the first issues of the same, and at his book \"Typography Now\" (issue 1).
    Locate some Cranbrook or CalArts catalogue, the narratives behind the works of
    Jon Barnbrook, Miles Newlyn, Jeffery Keedy, Frank Heine, Sue LaPorte, P. Scott
    Makela, Barry Deck and others in earlier issues of Emigre, and then you may have
    an idea of all the earthquake these caused in my mind of self-taught designer

  body: "My comment about Alias was because I see a lot of David James & Gareth Hague's
    intutions (but others as well) in letterforms picked up by the designer(s?) of
    Textaxis.\r\nFor example, the typeface Borneo has a lot of forms influenced by
    Alias' MetSys (which, in turn, was based on James' lettering for the early 1990s
    album covers of Steve Hillage's band System 7).\r\nInercia and Suite owe a lot
    to FF Dax (1995-1997) and the previous Barmeno (1983) by Hans Reichel;\r\nOneline
    is heavily influenced by Alias' Progress (2002);\r\nLatina Italic owes an lot
    (in terms of stylization) to John Downer's Triplex (1985), and so on\u2026"
