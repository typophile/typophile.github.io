body: A small bug seems to exist in the 'timezone' feature of 'My Account'. Although
  I've set my account to British time, no comment anywhere shows the correct time
  for me. I'm writing this at 13:15 on Sunday 21 November but the timestamp shown
  here is 5.15am.

    about comment timestamps, loosely related, it would be nice to have a simple way
    to refer to single comments on a thread <em>especially</em> if the timezone feature
    will work eventually* (what if I refer to the comment posted on 5.15am, but others
    see it with a different time?).\r\n\r\n* That is, if it will work in the way I
    think it should: giving each user a way to see threads timestamped according their
    timezone. Timestamping comments with the timezone of the poster would be crazy."

    \"lives\" - but I agree, having those timestamps shift to meet each user is how
    it's supposed to work, so there's clearly a bug. I'll look into it.\r\n\r\n"

    are not as simple as they seem. Thanks Jared.
