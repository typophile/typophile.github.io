  body: "It actually would appear to be primarily a font, albeit with the 'A' modified.\r\nThere
    are paragraphs of text in the font as a raster image in a PDF.  Insert image doesn't
    seem to be working, and the only way I could access the pdf was through Google,
    searching for\r\n  site:uefa.com filetype:pdf 2012 logo\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "I created the logo for the UEFA corporate body. \r\n\r\nRyuk is correct it
    was custom drawn from a sketch, with the modification of the E reflecting the
    U curve. The letter forms were very generic to start with, and whilst is was easier
    to create the straight version, the curved versions (which are the primary versions)
    involved a bit of optical correction. The F was modified later on the development
    to help harmonise the letterforms on the curve.\r\n\r\nThe Euro 2012 logomark
    and guidelines was created by another branding agency. All the fonts mentioned
    above do look as though they fit the style though."

  body: "Custom job to me. Only 4 letters so could be easily reproduced using any
    generic sans (you could even start with Helvetica). \r\nSome similars: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-beau-sans-pro/|Beau
    Sans]] (officially used during UEFA Euro 2012, very easy job with this one, only
    needs to recreate /U using the Beau Sans /U left half part and mirroring it then
    cutting /A horizontal bar and making /E top left corner squared), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/layarbahtera/layar-bahtera-doomsday/|Doomsday]]
