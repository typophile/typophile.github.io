  body: Thought we just talked about this one. The actor&#39;s name is &#39;Serpentine&#39;,
    but I don&#39;t remember the other answer.

  body: It was you who asked about another version of this just <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/54821.html?1101951789"
    target="_blank">a while ago</a>. <BR> <BR>Still Serpentine Oblique, but now used
    for actor&#39;s name.  <BR> <BR>This Johnny English lettering also looks a lot
    like something else we ID&#39;d recently, but at my age I can&#39;t be expected
    to remember all these fonts.

  body: YES, indeed I was the one who ask the Johnny English font a while ago, but
    as I work on my project I notice there were at least 4 different poster with 4
    different fonts.  <BR> <BR>So I end up with the wrong poster with I guess also
    wrong font used. <BR> <BR>I personal like to thanks all of you, who help me to
    identify the font. <BR> <BR> <BR>Jinile
