  up on a font that was ID'd here:\r\n\r\n[[http://dv3.typophile.com/node/72910]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow
  would I go about getting that faded effect on the font. Not sure what that would
  be called - grunge, eroded, faded. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if I could do that
  in indesign, but not sure how.\r\nI have CS5 so I can use other programs as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    white.\r\n2. Create a new layer, fill it with 50% black.\r\n3. Add a lot of noise.\r\n4.
    Use Gaussian Blur to create clumps.\r\n5. Copy this layer, load the type as a
    Selection, and Paste your clumps Into the Selection.\r\n\r\nThere are many other
    methods, of course..."

    in whatever fashion you prefer. Scratch...ink...wrinkle...\r\n1a. You can photocopy/print
    textures onto acetate too...\r\n\r\n2. Scan this in and adjust the colour and
    the levels until you get the image some black and white griminess\r\n3. Import
    into illustrator and Live Trace, expand and release the paths\r\n4. Scale this
    until the crappy pathing is acceptable\r\n5. Punch cut across your glyphs\r\n\r\nUsually
    I can't condone illustrator live tracing, but as your willfully distressing the
    face, it seems acceptable. You will get a horrendous amount of points in play
    using this method.\r\n\r\nEdit. \r\nThinking about it, I bet there's already prepped
    distress illustrator textures on the interweb. Although you will miss out on the
    fun destruction of acetate."
