    weight monospaced 'typewriter\u2019 face, originally created by Dutch designer
    Wim Crouwel in the 1960s. <strong>Crouwel's devotion to grids and systems led
    to his affectionate nickname of \u2018Mr Gridnik\u2019, </strong>and this inspired
    the new typeface family name. Foundry Gridnik\u2019s distinct geometric design
    has been described as \u2018the thinking man\u2019s Courier\u2019. Crouwel said,
    \u2018I am a functionalist troubled by aesthetics\u2019, and although Gridnik
    is based on logic, rationality and strict adherence to the grid, it also has a
    human dimension that sets it apart.\""
