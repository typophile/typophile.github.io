body: "I recently received a note a a unique handwriting style that would make a good
  font, I think - for very short texts. I've never seen one like it.\r\n\r\nNote the
  2 styles of lc \"f\", with and without a loop and the signature reverse-loop descenders.
  When a z precedes a big looped decscender as in \"amazing\" the z has a mini-loop
  so as not to have two giant loops overlapping.\r\n\r\nAnyone agree with me? I'm
  not a font designer, so I can't give it a try. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beccas-letter_6559.jpg]"
