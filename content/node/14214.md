    see http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf \r\n\r\nLooks like U+0360 and
    U+0342 \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\nPS we just added support for the double mark
    in the Windows core fonts and UI fonts."

  body: Wow, nice guess tim. I had forgotten this FontFont. I still don't think this
    sample is a font, but <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.11045.1.9&attributes.sampleSize=144&sampleText=mng%7E&sampleSize=96&attributes.paraSize=14&paraSize=14">FF
    Elementa</a> is close.

  body: "The marks are confusing because they've been rotated 180\xB0 -- if you orient
    them properly, you'll see that they're emoticons for \"Don't bother me, I'm sleeping\"
    and \"By Jove, dashing monocle, eh whot?\""

  body: "Taken from http://diacritics.typo.cz\r\nAnunaasika\r\nHistory and examples
    of use\r\nUsed in Sanskrit, the anunaasika is a dot above a letter. It is used
    by the devan\u0101gar\u012B script to represent vowel nasalization. When the letter
    is romanized, the anunaasika usually becomes a tilde.\r\n\r\nTilde\r\nHistory
    and examples of use\r\nTilde above the character softens n in Basque. In Spanish,
    the \xF1 is used as a separate letter roughly corresponding to the \"ny\" in \"canyon\".
    In Portuguese, it denotes nasality in a and o. Tilde above o was introduced into
    Estonian in 1818 by Otto Wilhem to denote pronunciation somewhere between \xF6
    and \u014D. In Vietnamese, the tilde (or d\u1EA5u ng\xE3) is used to specify a
    steep, glottalized, dipping and rising tone.\r\n\r\nSo I guess the answer is Vietnamese
    or Sanskrit\r\n\r\nor an emoticon involving John Lennon and a bad trip, dashing
    monocle indeed\r\nTim"
