  body: B seems hand lettered. Richard Beatty's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/richard_beatty/childs/?sample_text=Proprietario&sample_size=60">Childs</a>
    set has some similar styles.

  body: B is Utopian, an old typeface. Don't think there is digital version, at least
    with that name.

  body: I was agreeing with Stephen on this, the variations on the r especially sold
    me on hand drawn. But I guess it could also be a really distressed or greatly
    enlarged sample.

    new in this and have a big learning curve ahead.\r\nThe text below its just draws,

  body: "Couple of points:\r\n\u2022 The pen angles on the <em>d</em> and <em>q</em>
    are different from the rest of the font; did you just mirror the <em>p</em>?\r\n\u2022
    The <em>k</em> is just odd but almost works.&nbsp; (What does it look like in
    the source text?)\r\n\u2022 The <em>s</em> is too light in the main stroke of
    the letter.\r\n\u2022 The <em>t</em> is very awkward; note the height of the cross-bar
    and the rounding-off of the bottom of the stem in the original.\r\n\u2022 Where
    the original <em>o</em> has full-width stroke at either end of the stroke, yours
    just looks like somebody bit into the letter.\r\n\u2022 The <em>v</em> is a bit
    too wide, the <em>y</em> and the right half of the <em>w</em> much more so.&nbsp;
    (Yes, I see that they're all the same width; they shouldn't be.)\r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand\u2026\r\n\u2022 Good job on replacing the teardrop dot on the <em>i</em>,
    though the height and shape could be improved.&nbsp; (Maybe a slightly curve-y
    teardrop, almost a comma, a bit higher up?\r\n\u2022 Love the <em>m</em>.&nbsp;
    This font needs more such flourishes\u2014why'd you drop the dangling bit on the
    <em>r</em>?\r\n\r\n\u2014Joel"

    24pt. and 36pt. The strokes also appear irregular as the repro I have was done
    from an old antique hot metal shop."

  body: Why does m get a fancy terminal, and not n. (Have you thought about offering
    the fancy shapes as swash characters, and having them on the regular cut. I notice
    you didn't buy into the fancy r of the sample.)

  body: "Thanks all!\r\nWell... some letters are diferent is by the fact that I dont
    want to \"copy\" the font! Not sure how this works legally.\r\nCan I create (and
    register) a font call Utopian? That someone draw it 100 years ago?\r\nAt least
    moraly I dont think is correct... unless if you state it the \"author\".\r\nSo
    now I need the opinian of you all:\r\nDo I create it, and do an \"exact copy\"
    of it? or\r\nDo I adapt to my taste?\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    Ignacio. You're right again as usual.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio: my samples just show
    the word \"Utopian\" in 20, 24 and 36 points, very limited but it was enough for
    me to identify your sample. I can post or email during the weekend. Ignacio's
    link may serve you better."
