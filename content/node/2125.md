  body: Coincidence. The Hasbro is more clever, but not as adorable. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the headsup, Grant. I&#39;ve not been keeping up <BR>with Coudal like I should.

  body: Wow! What a great site. One of my big interests outside of type is animation.
    <BR> <BR>About the Terrytoons logo... The guy who did that--Gene Deitch--has had
    a pretty interesting life. You can read <a href="&#34;http://genedeitch.awn.com/index.php3?ltype=cover&#34;">his
    autobiography</a> online. &#40;This was one of the links I contributed during
    my little stint as a guest contributor at Coudal. Happily, it&#39;s still up.&#41;
