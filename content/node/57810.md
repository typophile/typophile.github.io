  is my first post ever here, :) (exciting) and I'm wondering if anyone can help me
  out with identifying this typeface:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo
  nc_6201.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've tried Identifont.com and What The Font.com but they failed
  to give me an accurate result that contained these three special elements: the lower-case
  trident 'w', the sans 'n', and that special 'e'. \r\n\r\nThis is part of a company
  logo so the typeface they chose might have gone through some alterings and interventions.
  \r\n\r\nIf anyone can identify it I'll greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks Typophiles!"
