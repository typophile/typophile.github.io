  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Is anyone interested in collaborating on a set of astrological glyphs? I was directed to this forum by a successful young designer who did not want to undertake the project and thought I should roll my own (maybe a 30-something dynamo is not aware of how daunting learning curves can be to a 70-year-old).</p>
<p>Although I have loved typography all my life, have several reference works on my shelves, and used to handset poetry for a small press, the discussions here have left me shorn of all confidence. At the very least 62 characters would be involved - most likely more because it would be good to provide alternatives in a few cases, particularly the tiny number in which I would insist on (I hope easily justified) departures from convention. But I am aware that the choice of glyph forms might be the smallest problem, compared to such questions as portability, which glyphs to design as both fixed- and variable-width characters, etc.</p>
<p>There was a discussion on astrological and astronomical symbols here a while ago. The participants seemed as lost in the astro world as I am in the typographic; but I think I can be a sound bridge between the two cultures.</p>

Almost all available astrological characters are either ruler-and-compass stick figures, clumsy glyphs drawn with no feeling for type forms, or self-indulgent fancy inventions. Those that are truly elegant lack many necessary characters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>riccard0: Zapf made elegant planet and sign symbols to go with Palatino. Many symbols are missing and a couple should be reworked but, anyway, I am hoping for a set that would be more consistent with a good workhorse typeface - one that could fill a heavy textbook without tiring the reader (for which Palatino is ever so slightly too mannered imo). There are beautiful and valid models in Renaissance books and even in Hellenistic manuscripts, but of course that is not what you mean.</p>
<p>I have a workhorse or two in mind but I hesitate to start with that idea when I am asking if someone will want to work with me. There is also the question of how transferable to other contexts a set of symbols could/should be - I have no clue.</p>
<p>cuttlefish: You are thinking of the Unicode astrological symbols listed in Wikipedia? The set is almost complete (the main lacuna is a complete and consistent set of 36-degree aspects) but the execution is ghastly and in a few cases absurd.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_symbols">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_symbols</a></p>
<p>(And don&rsquo;t take their explanations of the symbols too seriously!)</p>
<p>By the way, the order and code assignments of astrological symbols I have seen vary from one design to the next. I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter, though it might be clever to adopt the Unicode range. At this point it&rsquo;s the least of my worries.</p>

<p>altaira: That is a great way to display a font, with mouseover for italics. The set is almost complete but not very successful imo.</p>
<p>Jongseong: I like Koch&rsquo;s signs very much - they can be blown up, framed, and admired on a wall. But their faux-primitive style is too distracting for a font meant to accompany text.</p>
<p>quadibloc: Yes, Q seems to be what people use for the quintile. The others are improvisations. I have an idea for a rational design that would represent the entire series with minor but easily learned differentiations - including the tredecile (108°) which everyone seems to ignore.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m too critical to collaborate with anyone, should stop kvetching and just do this myself. But to misquote Groucho Marx, I wouldn&rsquo;t approve of anything I could do.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The general point of Unicode is to assign a number to every written mark used in human language. These numbers are useful in developing fonts among many other applications. The specific design in the code charts is not prescriptive, but the meaning generally is, e.g.: the snowman at U+2603 could be drawn differently but still recognizably be a snowman; you&rsquo;re not supposed to put just any random symbol in that spot.</p>
<p>You can submit a request to add glyphs that you feel necessary to complete the astrological/astronomical symbol group to the Unicode consortium, but that can be a complicated process. [[http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html]]</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t get you the font that you need in short order, a very different question indeed.</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Unicode is a standard for which character has what code, just like ASCII. ASCII just says that the number 64 stands for the uppercase letter A, not whether that A is in Courier or Times Roman. And, in fact, the Unicode document warns people against stealing the typefaces they were graciously allowed to use to print the thing as a way to create a Unicode typeface.</p>
<p>ISO 8858-1, the 8-bit code that added accented characters to the &ldquo;high bit&rdquo; range, was &ldquo;official&rdquo;, but not compulsory. One could put Japanese katakana in the high bit range instead, or different accented letters to support Hungarian and certain other languages. Even ASCII had &ldquo;national use&rdquo; positions.</p>
<p>To be Unicode-compliant, you would not replace the hammer and sickle with the biquintile&hellip; instead, you would put the biquintile &lsquo;way up in the &ldquo;private use area&rdquo;. To be usable on some older systems, you might prefer to make an 8-bit font, not a Unicode font, and replace the accented letters by the aspects instead.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@AxelHarvey: Judging by your posts, I think I know and have what you are looking for, that is, at least the symbols which are included in the Unicode chart, but it should not be too difficult to design a couple of more – based on the already existing ones, to preserve the stylistic unity and the ’weight’ – and put them somewhere in the PUA, so they can be accessed even in the non-OT-savvy text appliances, such as Word, for instance. As for the style, they are part of a Garaldesque bookish font I’m working on, which is what you seem to prefer anyway, so that’s already one thing we have in common; and the other being that I’m also too critical to collaborate with anyone – well, it can’t go wrong, can it?</p>
<p>Perhaps we should get in touch outside this forum, as there seems not to be too much interest for your proposal anyway; only, I don’t know how it’s done, there being, understandably, no e-mail addresses here, and this is the very first time I take part in these jolly ado’s (which I silently relish for some years now).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry for my absence - it&rsquo;s been hectic (including a furnace breakdown now fixed).</p>
<p>As for the Andron astrological characters there are two types of consideration. First, there are what I would call &ldquo;substantive form&rdquo; issues which have to do with preferences and taste, so there one&rsquo;s decisions are as good as anyone else&rsquo;s. For example I would prefer a Z shape for Jupiter rather than a curve for historical and symbolic reasons, but that is a personal matter.</p>
<p>Then there are &ldquo;execution&rdquo; issues. For example, I find there are too many serifs, and they are too strong. Here I think one&rsquo;s inspiration should be numerals. The Andron digits 0 to 9 - which I like - have serifs on the 1, what might be called half-serifs on the 2, 4, 5, and 7 (only one on each), and a discreet finishing tick at the top of 3 (if I am seeing correctly). The same restraint should apply to astrological symbols. As it is there are right-angled full serifs on the Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Virgo, Scorpio, Sagittarius, and Capricorn glyphs, and I find them annoying. The angled half-serifs, as on the Libra glyph and the lower end of the outer vertical strokes of Uranus, are fine. The Neptune glyph has three harpoon barbs instead of serifs. I know this is a reference to Neptune&rsquo;s trident and it is often done that way, but to me it is sliding from typography towards illustration.</p>
<p>All the above is &ldquo;sous toute réserve&rdquo; since I feel like a snail criticizing a football team. I can&rsquo;t comment on the weight and shading because I have not seen the astro characters blended with a block of text.</p>
<p>The new 116-character Unicode block is good news.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I honour your detailed discussion of design details!</p>
<p>First, [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=218|on this page (scroll down a bit)]] everyone can see an actual piece of text (by I. Newton) which contains astrological and measurement signs.</p>
<p>This is it what we are talking about:
<img src="/images/old-images/andron_astro_3870.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <em>coining</em> (dt. Ausprägung) – or “execution” – of those signs is a matter which indeed raises some questions, for me too. Is it about taste only – or can justified decisions be made here?</p>
<p><cite>I would prefer a Z shape for Jupiter rather than a curve for historical and symbolic reasons, but that is a personal matter.</cite>
– if there are historical and symbolic reasons for this preference, this is certainly not a matter of mere personal taste. I know both the pointed and the rounded Jupiter sign and found the latter more appropriate to accompany a Venetian-style font, mostly from my knowlegde of old prints. But if you have deeper insights in the nature of that sign I would be obliged to learn about it.</p>
<p><cite>… too many serifs, and they are too strong. Here I think one&rsquo;s inspiration should be numerals</cite>
Maybe you’re right with this, maybe not. The Venus often gets serifed crossbars which I omitted. Maybe the Jupiter and the Sagittarius would do with less as well. But the Uranus and Pluto signs definitely relate to Latin Capitals and an ‘archaeological’ glyph shaping ought to make this visible, in my opinion. (You’ll notice a second Pluto glyph, I’m not entirely happy with both).</p>
<p><cite>The Neptune glyph has three harpoon barbs instead of serifs. I know this is a reference to Neptune&rsquo;s trident and it is often done that way, but to me it is sliding from typography towards illustration.</cite>
– the path you’re sliding on is inherent in typography! You can’t escape. – What are you then to make of the arrow point of the Mars? Also too illustrative? At least my Neptun glyphs have no serifs on the crossbars, which you can see often elsewhere.</p>
<p>As for the Virgo I know of an interpretation as a kind of m_r ligature (“Maria”), therefore the resemblance of the Latin m. The same element in the Scorpio sign, I don’t know of any such interpretation as yet. But for reasons of visual consistency the respective parts of both glyph have to match.</p>
<p>Twelve sixpacks of fine beer to him or her who writes a profound historical-typographical survey upon “The shapes of astrological signs”.
(– Or is it existing already??)</p>
<p>(And good luck with your furnace! Mine one is lousy too.)
A. St.</p>

<p>Point taken, John. I was aware of the issue, and differentiated Capricorn from Scorpio in that regard, but perhaps not enough.

After I posted my comment, though, I checked around on the Web for images of the Capricorn glyph, as I could only find one of the two forms I was familiar with in specimen books I was looking through.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I&rsquo;m not aware of any standard for the zodiac symbols. I think a number of artists have added their own flair or style. I know of three different symbols for Capricorn, which tend to be regional.
Andreas, I don&rsquo;t see any astrological symbols in your character map. You present a nice and consistent style, rather than the one displayed by Unicode.org and others which is inconsistent with some glyphs appearing to be a rip-off of ones I created and some being butchered&ndash;I&rsquo;m referring the the thick-nib pen style symbols.
A bit off-topic, but while alchemy can transform, it is akin to basic chemistry with one notable exception: Alchemists consider the life force in any cell, while chemists do not generally take this position. The original Order of the Rosicrucians use alchemy even today. The symbols used in alchemy have changed over the centuries, due mainly to certain individuals defrauding people with the use of the symbols, once they were known.</div>

<p>yeep … right. This image shows the new 1F7xx Alchemical block. But the new font will contain all relevant astrological signs as well. The two subjects are intertwined in many ways, so the respective characters do form a sort of a set, i.m.o.</p>
