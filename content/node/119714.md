    a circa 1900 type (W. Grauneau, Berlin) could work with some serious modifications:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/berolina/\r\n\r\nSame
    goes for another Solotype option, Mural (Boston Type Foundry, 1889):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/mural/\r\n\r\nSome
    letters also bear a strong resemblance to Windsor (E. Pechey, Stephenson Blake,

    Hermann Ihlenberg also made a fancy mortised version which Paul Hunt has transformed

  body: "Edited:\r\nPerhaps not a font. At least I don't recall seeing a font that
    looks quite like this. The sign could be lettering based on a free interpretation
    of some late Victorian era designs. The arrowhead terminals on the swan neck _S_
    and other letters,  were a common design solution. The boxy high waist design
    was fairly popular. The swirl decorations were sometimes applied to letters. \r\nVery
    little of this is found in digital fonts. \r\nMural, suggested by Kevin has boxy
    high waist design.\r\nAnother is Yolanda countess by Rian Hughes. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/YolandaCountessInUse1_3863.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/YolandaCountessInUse2_6483.gif]

    digitized Monopol in 2000 and used to offer it in several formats. Today, he only
    offers it in FontForge format (FontForge being a font editor he created). It can
    be found in TrueType format elsewhere on the Web.

  body: "Thanks for reminding me Mike. Seems I now forget old facts when I learn new
    ones. As Philip K. Dick said \"overdrawn at the memory bank\"  :)\r\nBTW anyone
    wishing to replicate the lettering could do worse than to start with Monopol by
    George Williams. \r\nAlso, onn closer examination of the the letters I can't be
    certain if the letters have swirls or bullet holes. If they are swirls Ringlet
    digitized by George Williams, follow the same link, is a good source for them.\r\nDon"
