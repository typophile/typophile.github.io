body: Hey folks, <BR>I came across a dingbat font of army men &#40;like the childhood
  toy&#41; a couple years ago, but now I can&#39;t find it or even remember the name.
  Is anyone familiar with this? It kinda had the same feel as Swifty. Any help would
  be appreciated. <BR> <BR>Cheers!

    target="_blank"> WW2 Soldier Font</a>. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not really like those
    old plastic figures &#40;these are mostly in at-ease, <BR>relaxed poses&#41;,
    but it&#39;s all I could find. <BR>

  body: 'thanks for the effort, but it&#39;s not Army Boy.  It&#39;s a dingbat font
    where each letter shows a toy soldier in a different pose. there are no actual
    aphanumeric characters in the font. '
