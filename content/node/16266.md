body: they have a teeshirt that is a benefit for the huricane affected people of New
  Orleans. Good for them. We might need a teeshirt benefit for the riots in France

  body: "as the designer of said t-shirt, i'm pleased to say i hear they've been selling
    really well.\r\n\r\nit's an odd thing though; after receiving the call to help
    out for this one, the earthquake in Kashmir struck, and ... well, it just seems
    to be one disaster after another in this old world. it would seem we need a lot
    more t-shirts to put a lot more pennies in those big wells of misfortune.\r\n\r\n-marian"
