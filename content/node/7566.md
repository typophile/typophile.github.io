body: I am thinking of drawing a script font based on someone&#39;s handwriting. The
  writing comes from an old document, it&#39;s a registry that was maintained by a
  general store owner, a long time ago, to see who bought what and how much they owed
  him, etc. I have access to photocopies of this document. All rights on it were donated
  by the family of the owner to a historical society in my area. I was thinking of
  naming the font after his name. <BR> <BR>I have a lot of questions regarding this
  type of project.  <BR> <BR>What are the standard guidelines regarding copyrights
  or commercial royalties on these types of fonts?  <BR> <BR>When someone is dead,
  are there any types of rights on their writing? &#40;Or are there even rights when
  they are alive?&#41; If there are, would they belong to the family or to whoever
  is the owner of the source inspiration for the font?  <BR> <BR>Has anyone done this
  and gotten in trouble before? If so, what kind? :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Em

  body: I forgot to write that I am in Canada. How do laws work on that matter? Do
    laws apply where the font is designed, where it&#39;s distributed, where it&#39;s
    sold..etc? <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Emilie

  body: 'Emilie, I did something similar to that for a Uni project. Except in my case
    all I had to work off was the TO: address on the envelope. However, the idiosyncracies
    in the handwriting intrigued me... I will post in the critiques section sooner
    or later, so we&#39;ll see what kind of legal issues this brings up then. <BR>
    <BR>P.S. This letter was not personal, and was sent from a company in New Zealand,
    so it&#39;s simply called Kiwi Casual, but I&#39;m not final on that name.'

  body: Emilie, first thing I would do is contact the historical society in question.
    Explain exactly what your intentions are, and make clear that you want to make
    a commercial font for sale. This is very important, especially because you&#39;d
    like to use the person&#39;s name as well. Definitely keep a paper trail of all
    correspondence.  <BR> <BR>One other thing about doing it together with the historical
    society is that they may be willing and able to provide some form of promotion/exposure
    for your endeavour. <BR> <BR>BTW, how did you obtain the copies? If they are available
    to the public, there&#39;s a chance they may be in the public domain &#40;i.e.
    copyright-free&#41;. <BR> <BR>I designed a typeface based on a person&#39;s handwriting,
    after we signed a contract to split the proceeds from the sale. Now that font
    is going to be released by Bitstream &#40;hopefully, this summer&#41;.
