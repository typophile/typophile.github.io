body: "I am new at font creation, as will be apparent by this post, and was wondering
  how to go about making bitmap fonts.  Allow me to give you a bit of context...  I
  am working with php dynamic imaging, specifically the GD Library.  I want to create
  custom bitmap fonts in order to load with the imageloadfont() function.  It may
  help you answer my question if you take a look at the following page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.widgnet.com/gdf_fonts/\r\n\r\nFor
  a small library of these fonts to play with or at least take a look at in order
  to help answer my questiong, please take a look at the following page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.widgnet.com/gdf_fonts/fonts.html\r\n\r\nApparently
  the creator of this site was able to convert TTF fonts into GDF fonts fairly simply,
  but he does not explain how, or perhaps I am overlooking a key part of the site.\r\n\r\nEssentially,
  I want to be able to create a small bitmap (maybe 8 by 13 px or something similar,
  that's not the important part...) for each letter/symbol and compile these bitmaps
  into a font file.  This font file then has the following information:\r\n\r\nbyte
  0-3  (int)  number of characters in the font\r\nbyte 4-7  (int)  value of first
  character in the font (often 32 for space)\r\nbyte 8-11 (int)  pixel width of each
  character\r\nbyte 12-15 (int)  pixel height of each character\r\nbyte 16-EOF (char)
  \ array with character data, one byte per pixel in each character, for a total of
  (nchars*width*height) bytes.\r\n\r\nAnd while I may understand what this information
  is saying, I'm not sure how to go about using it.  Any and all help is appreciated.
  \ Thank you =)\r\n\r\n-Trevor"

  body: Hmm... I found a <a href=http://puremango.co.uk/cm_fontmaker_114.php>PHP font
    converter</a> which converts a *.png file into a *.gdf file, but is this the only
    way to go about creating a *.gdf file?

    Hmm."

  body: yo, I'm the puremango dude; if you're talking about the example font on the
    png2gdf app, I can change the font or link to you if you want? sorry if you're
    annoyed; I know how it feels when your work gets passed off as someone else's
    and I promise that wasn't the intention here.

  body: and to antiaverage, if you know PHP, the font convertor tool goes through
    the process step by step, alternatively if you're looking for other ways of creating
    GD fonts, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philiplb.de/index.php?showdownload=63&p=Downloads">philiplb.de's
    TTF2GDF tool</a>

  body: "user24--It's okay, but it would be nice if you could credit the source somehow.
    Anonymous\u2122 is a free font, but not free-as-in-free-beer."

  body: "mark; actually on further inspection, the font I used was Arial - I couldn't
    remember because it's been a while since I wrote the app.\r\n\r\nWhen you said
    <cite>One of the bitmap fonts that guy did is based on my Anonymous\u2122 TrueType
    font</cite>, I thought you meant me, but I think you were actually refering to
    the widgnet URL, not the <a href=\"http://puremango.co.uk/font.png\" target=\"_blank\">example
    PNG</a> on my site.\r\n\r\nAh well, if I had used your font, you can be assured
    there would now be a link to you. ;-)"

  body: I've been struggling with GDF fonts lately, too.  Apparently, the fonts are
    architecture-dependent.  I need to use them on a Sun Sparc machine, so the tools
    mentioned earlier in this thread don't really work for me.  Is there anywhere
    I can get step-by-step info on how to create these fonts?  Or, is there a tool
    out there that works for Sparc machines?
