  body: Given the time period, I would say this is likely to be Hellenic Wide. While
    this may not be new information, it may help to find out that we&#39;ve discussed
    this recently <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64212.html?1107078643"
    target="_blank">here</a> and not so recently <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/2866.html?1035468607"
    target="_blank">here</a>. The above suggestion of FF Zapata is a great one and
    there is a wealth of information about Hellenic Wide in the links above, including
    a non-commercial version called Stereo.
