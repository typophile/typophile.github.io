    so like all styles, it will come in and out of fashion. Personally, the proportions
    are distracting to my eye. You can start with the \"geometric\" /OCDGQ/, which
    all feel uncomfortably wide. Why are /EFLPST/ so narrow and /AN/ so wide?\r\n\r\nJust
    what on Earth is going on with just-barely-broken /K/? The pointy vertices on
    /AMNVWX/ stick out in more ways than one. And the /S/ commits multiple offenses
    in my book.\r\n\r\nWithout seeing your design, it's hard to recommend anything.
    Avenir was designed as a riff and \"improvement\" on Futura, but it has exploded
    in popularity in the past two years thanks to Apple, so it may be temporarily
    played out. Maybe give LL Circular a try?"

    for its basic modernistic concept. It's perfect for big titles.\r\nMeditation
    and Modernity are opposite matters.\r\n\r\n\xB6 <em>Futura</em> is irrelevant
    for the nature of your book and your client's judgment is understandable. Your
    client wishes a neo-humanist typefaces. Try to explore this thread in which I
    and members draw list of neo-humanist ones that 'may' fit your assignment.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/116746\r\n"

    the book title. It is following on with a design feel that has been previously
    mapped out for some other books. The design standpoint of the books is actually
    deliberately modern in their intent with very clean logo-like vector graphics
    in place. This is one of the other books which I think used Helvetica:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Mindfulness-Health-practical-relieving-restoring/dp/074995924X/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1406747164&sr=1-6&keywords=mindfulness+a+practical+guide+to+finding+peace+in+a+frantic+world\r\n\r\nIn
    any case I will take Fourneirs advice and look at neo-humanist typefaces maybe.\r\n\r\n"

    would you want to use a 1920's typeface for a \"deliberately modern\" book anyway?
    Do you tend to use steam engines to communicate the modernity of mechanics?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    when thinking of meditation, geometric typefaces don't come to mind. I strongly
    suspect these associations would differ per person, but I would likely look for
    a more vivid typeface. Not organic, but definitely more alive than Futura.\r\n\r\nI
    personally like to see Futura on the street; for some reason I always enjoy recognizing
    it and every time I see it I have to think of how prolific that /S is. I wouldn't
    call it a great typeface though and I would be hesitant using it myself."

  body: "Thanks Martin,\r\nAs ever, typefaces seem to bring out some quite strong
    opinions (which is a good thing). They are very emotional creations after all.
    This is a matter of opinion of course, but I personally like to believe that a
    typeface that was designed in the 1920's can still be thought of being modern
    in it's personality. \r\nFutura to me will always look modern and a bit confrontational.
    It is quite brutal as the author says!\r\nSome book cover designs are still seen
    as modern and contemporary even though they were designed many years ago. I guess
    this is the same for most things really.\r\nI am of course interested in what
    you believe is a suitable typeface for a book on a book about meditation?\r\nIf
    you look on amazon you will see designers in the past have pretty much chosen
    every type of typeface out there. I do want to keep it sans-serif (though maybe
    a slab serif could work) as I think this suits the vector illustrations that are
    going to be used on the cover. I just dropped Meta onto the cover and this font
    to me just has too much character. I need something fairly plain (less difference
    in stroke widths) etc as boring as that possibly sounds.\r\nFonts that could maybe
    work to my mind are: Gotham, GilanGothic, or Myriad. Also just tried Kievit and
    that looks pretty good in fact."

    that a typeface that was designed in the 1920's can still be thought of being
    modern in it's personality.</cite>\r\n\r\nYes, they still have their place, but
    don't confuse modernism with contemporary faces. Examples of typefaces I would
    truly consider modern in the contemporary sense are Beau Sans, Beleza, Exo 2.0,
    Hackman, Klaus FY, Proxima Nova, Riccia, Telcel, Zarina Sans etc.; not dusty old
    typefaces like Erbar, Futura, Kabel, or the newer but god-awful Avant Garde.\r\n\r\nWhat
    we consider to be modern is minimalism and spaciousness. As such, Futura is often
    seen as modern as it's clearly minimal. I think the mistake people make here is
    that there is a great distinction between a clean, neutral typeface and what was
    considered modern in the early 20th century, which were constructed typefaces
    rather than designed typefaces. Typefaces in the Bauhaus style are not considered
    to be modern because construction is regarded higher than optical design while
    contemporary modernism is all about clarity. Many of these early geometric typefaces
    have more to do with construction than design. I don't consider it a good practice
    to equate Futura with contemporary modernism.\r\n\r\n<cite>So I opted for what
    I thought would be a clean crisp san-serif font with good legibility.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    would consider Futura to be minimal; clean and crisp a bit less so. Whether Futura
    has good legibility I do question though. Also, the dimensions of Futura are just
    not modern to me in the contemporary sense. The x-height is too low, the ascenders
    too tall, the bowls of P/R too high and small, many of the capitals are too condensed,
    there are too many abrupt horizontal/vertical cuts in the terminals, the /t has
    no terminal (which looks very Bauhaus to me), the capital /J has a descender and
    M/N are reminiscent of glyphic Roman lettering.\r\n\r\n<cite>Some book cover designs
    are still seen as modern and contemporary even though they were designed many
    years ago.</cite>\r\n\r\nYou're absolutely right, but I would be careful with
    what typefaces you select for the job anyway. Thinking Futura is modern may lead
    to problems. It's true that by using Futura in a modern way, people get the impression
    it's true modernism but I think you confuse the whole style that way. For example,
    ITC Avant Garde has been considered a modern typeface up to 2000 or so, but I
    cringe every time I see it as it takes me back to the 90's. The very tight spacing
    is also an example of this outdated sense of modernism. While Futura still works,
    I don't think ITC Avant Garde should ever be used again.\r\n\r\n<cite>I am of
    course interested in what you believe is a suitable typeface for a book on a book
    about meditation?</cite>\r\n\r\nI'm pretty good at offering criticism but I must
    admit I'm not a great typographer. I'm not even sure which style would fit a book
    about meditation exactly. Perhaps something very clean would work but it depends
    on many things. What aspect of meditation is talked about, is it a scientific
    interpretation of meditation and its effect on human psychology or is it a guidebook
    or speculative new-age stuff? What kind of art or design are you using and what
    colors? What's the layout like and which typefaces are you using in combination?\r\n\r\nYou
    don't have to answer these questions to me because as I said I'm not a great typographer
    so I probably wouldn't make a great choice. However, I can offer you the names
    of typefaces from specific styles. If you're still looking for something clean
    and crisp, I might consider Benton Sans, Libertad, Museo Sans, Proxima Nova, Samo
    Sans or Variable. If you want something modern (yet arguably less crisp) you might
    consider Adelle Sans, Centro Sans, Geometrica, Scala Sans or Urban Grotesk. If
    you want something more vivid you might try Andulka Sans, Auto, Foco Corp, Gentona,
    Gloriola, Karmina Sans, Oksana Sans, Oksana Text, Quire Sans, Sensato or Sentosa.
    I personally think you may find something suitable in the last bunch I named.
    Search for modern humanist typefaces. I think you might need a typeface that is
    clean and modern yet vivid and friendly. But again, I don't know what exactly
    you want to convey with the design of the book, so you might need something else
    entirely. I can imagine certain serif typefaces working well for this job as well.\r\n\r\nGotham
    is probably a better choice than Futura when it comes to its design, but it's
    probably too prolific. I always try to find alternatives to typefaces which are
    overused when it comes to commercial projects. I do use Gotham for school presentations
    at times because it's very clear, but I'm more hesitant about using it when it
    comes to branding or book design."

    font used is a variant of Avant Garde.</cite>\r\nOkay, those books look quite
    attractive. I guess I will have to elaborate on my opinion of ITC Avant Garde.
    I absolutely hate capital ligatures. I consider this to be the devil:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/42189_4391.big_.png]\r\n\r\nJust
    like Futura, ITC Avant Garde has some odd proportions, which lend itself well
    for display use such as on the Penguin Modern Classics. I think it works for a
    book series because it's general branding, rather than branding of a specific
    book. For branding a specific book the typeface you use should be a lot more telling
    about the content of the book. I have to say though that I still feel ITC Avant
    Garde is used in a bad way for the Penguin book series. The spacing is very tight
    but I can see the appeal here, but some characters are kerned way too tightly.
    Kerning Tr and Te this tightly is not something typographers tend to do nowadays.
    It's very obtrusive to me. The kerning in \"Ayn [Rand]\" is absolutely horrendous.
    I also feel the /t is so condensed it almost disappears. The /s is also very condensed
    (as is Futura's /s) but it still has some presence. Also have a look at the Jean-Paul
    Sartre cover and notice how \"Jean-Paul\" is not optically aligned due to the
    gap on the left side of J. Usually you don't get that issue when the spacing is
    looser because you compensate for big gaps in between letters such as A, J, L,
    V, W and Y. With very tight spacing you get all kinds of problems. The capital
    letter ligatures have been added to compensate for some of those spacing problems."
