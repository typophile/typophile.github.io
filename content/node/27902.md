  body: "Yes I put the whole serial number in and it didn't work. Then I tried it
    with just the 3K441 and it also didn't work. So Maybe I'll go down to the Apple
    store and show them the battery and see if they can sort it. \r\n\r\nEver since
    I had this laptop I was always worried it would catch on fire since I never trust
    Apple laptops since the Powerbook 100."

  body: "you should remove the battery by turning the screw thing on the bottom to
    release the battery.\r\n\r\non the back of the battery will be the battery model
    and serial number.\r\n\r\nCheck your numbers against the ones on www.apple.com/support/
    \ Then select the link from 'Exchange and Extensions' and 'Battery Exchange' \r\n\r\nThere
    you will find the models affected and the serial numbers affected.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/battery_12inch_pbook_large_4852.jpg]"

    they miss the opportunity to get a new fresh battery! The recall involves registering,
    waiting to receive a new battery and sending the old one back, so there's no down
    time. By the way, I beleive Sony's paying for the whole thing\r\n\r\nhttps://support.apple.com/ibook_powerbook/batteryexchange/index.html"

    batteries were sold worldwide from October 2003 through August 2006 for use with
    the following notebook computers: 12-inch iBook G4, 12-inch PowerBook G4 and 15-inch
    PowerBook G4.\r\n\r\nI actually bought mine before this date so I guess I won't
    self-combust."

    the battery serial number was invalid is because it is not affected and not one
    of the recall batteries. It has been made by somewhere else.\r\n\r\nSo 3K441 is
    ok."

    with Sony parts.\r\n\r\nIe. 3K428 - 3K611 is the range for my PowerBook battery.
    My battery starts with 3K441 which is in the Apple recall range. The website said
    the number was invalid. Calling Apple they said that even though it is in the
    range some batteries in the range are made by different manufacturers and not
    affected. \r\n\r\nAlso a Dell we have is also in the Dell recall list and the
    battery is listed but the Dell website also says the battery is not affected even
    though it is in their recall list....."

  body: "When I first tried to enter the info on Apple's Battery Recall page it didn't
    work. I think this must have been because so many people were trying to access
    the site at the same time because the battery I was checking fell in the s/n range.
    Then a few days later I tried again and it worked. I am now waiting on a new battery.\r\n\r\nAt
    first the pages wouldn't load completely. Then, after I entered the information
    and clicked continue, the link timed out. Later, the link worked but it said the
    battery s/n was invalid. A few days later I tried again and everything went through.\r\n\r\nThe
    point is, if your battery s/n is within the specified range, but you got a message
    declaring it invalid, perhaps you should try again."
