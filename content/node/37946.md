  read about a new \"Adobe vs. Linotype\" lawsuit:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"On October 30, 2006,
  Adobe Systems filed an action in the United States District Court of the Northern
  District of California against Linotype alleging that Linotype breached its obligations
  under agreements between Linotype and Adobe by failing to pay all royalties due
  under those agreements, submitting inaccurate royalty reports, and using the fonts
  licensed under those agreements improperly and without authorization. Adobe requests
  unspecified money damages, a declaratory judgment, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.
  On March 2, 2007, the court entered an order staying the action. The parties have
  moved jointly to extend the existing stay until November 15, 2007. We intend to
  vigorously contest the action.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nWho has more details concerning this
  new lawsuit?"

    disagree. Further below in above document, Monotype writes:\r\n\r\n<cite>An unfavorable
    outcome in this lawsuit could result in an increase of the amount of royalties
    we have to pay Adobe. Any royalties paid as a result of this or any successful
    challenge would increase our expenses and could negatively impact our relationship
    with such licensor, including by impairing our ability to continue to use and
    re-license technologies or fonts from that licensor. ... ... We have been in the
    past involved in litigation with third parties, including Adobe, to defend our
    intellectual property rights and have not always prevailed.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    \"end user\" as ordinary font buyer, who reads such statements made by Monotype
    alias Linotype, will think: Why should I want to pay for fonts, if even Monotype
    and Linotype do not want to pay for fonts?\r\n"

    foundries and designers are using the Euro or British pound as currency, both
    of which are now worth a lot more than the US dollar. Currency fluctuations can
    dramatically affect revenue and profit when contracts and sales are made internationally.
    Just think of how happy the Brits are when they purchase from myfonts - what a
    bargain!"

    comparisons because all the fonts I've browsed are the ones I've seen the prices
    before and their prices are much higher. Because why? Because they can. \r\n\r\nIts
    unacceptable because its not incremental. In other markets it has to move slowly.
    Other markets, we're generally referring to are manufactured goods, but fonts
    are made once and sold over and over. So economy or not I think its a rip off.
    If it was just localized to Monotype I wouldn't care too much, but since they
    are the Microsoft of the type world they set market price everywhere else. I'm
    just glad that I really don't care for much of the output coming out of Monotype
    these days. The indies get my business. There is better value (and quality) there.\r\n"

  body: "Without knowing which fonts you're talking about, Mikey, I couldn't possibly
    do any historical pricing comparisons. Having worked for several type foundries
    and distributors in the past decade, I know for a fact that a number of fonts
    under the Monotype Imaging umbrella have been priced in the $40 range for years.
    Before I started working in the type business, I managed font libraries and licensed
    a lot of type for a variety of companies from many different distributors. I'm
    familiar with pricing from both sides historically speaking, otherwise I wouldn't
    comment.\r\n\r\nEven some typefaces that are the same design but licensed from
    different sources can have different pricing. It can get kind of complicated to
    be a typeface distributor, and I understand that it might be confusing to someone
    who has no knowledge of the business side of type.\r\n\r\nI see a lot of markets
    moving quickly in price increases. If one doesn't like the prices at one foundry/distributor,
    there are myriad other choices. Monotype does not dictate the pricing in the worldwide
    font sales market - many factors go into determining pricing. With so many type
    designers and foundries operating independently, I don't think you have to worry
    that all font prices are going to unilaterally double or triple in the near future.
    Since you prefer indie type, it seems like you are in good shape."

  body: "Other hidden costs: While you don't always see this, anyone running a web
    store has costs that can change; they might have to migrate to a new server, they
    might have to completely switch their web merchant software, their server might
    have raised their prices, the site might have become so busy that the costs to
    run it are going up. It's a little simplistic to say \"making fonts doesn't cost
    more, so the font prices should never go up\". There's the matter of where the
    type comes from, is it licensed directly or resold? Is the OT version something
    that was generated automatically, or painstakingly made by a person? Is the PS
    version actually the same one generated in 1989, or has it been updated several
    times, improving overall reliability? Have the royalty arrangements changed between
    foundries? When you buy Minion from Adobe, there have probably been several versions
    of what appear to be the same exact file. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure why you think price
    increases like this aren't incremental. If the price actually doubled every year
    after not changing for a decade, that would be unexpected. From $40 to $42 isn't
    what I call exhorbitant. "
