  body: Back in the day when there were proprietary output systems for setting photo
    composition, vendor A would not allow vendor B to use the "real" font without
    a substantial fee. Vendor B often made his own version to run on his own equipment
    so he could offer the "hot new face". They also came up with a nice pseudo name
    that, with a wink and a nod, told you which face it was masking as :-)

  body: God knows who's in charge for the Conference Proceedings but it must be a
    big job, being an important international conference and all that. My guess the
    gig has been assigned to some graphic design office in Sao Paulo and someone there
    thinks it's fun to read an academic text, full of all sort of citations, dates,
    notes, references etc. in Helvetica. Plus such a Modernist type for a conference
    on Urban planning history when we should be  trying harder to distance ourselves
    from all the damages that such an ideology has produced in terms of town planning.
    A bad choice in many aspects. Brazilian architects, designers and planners are
    still very much attached to all things Modern.

  body: No designer uses the fonts supplied by an author or editor. They just want
    the text with as little formatting s possible.  My guess would be that they were
    eyeball copyfitting.  At a quick glance, they could judge how much space the text
    would occupy.  They could have chosen any easy to get font.  This kind of a thing
    is a holdover from the old University days of standardized thesis and dissertation
    writing.  Some folks never change ;-)  When I was in Grad school in the early
    70s, the only way you could get the Dean's approval was if you hired one of the
    3 approved typists to match all the specifications to a T.  Thank god for the

    one or two typefaces in his career so he was more of a typographer and graphic
    designer) in a manner which made it sound both magical and tedious. There's something
    to be admired for the craft and manual work that was involved, but I'm glad I
    can skip that part. However due to this lack of insight in the old methods I think

    IPHS Conference</a> in S\xE3o Paulo. What I found is Word templates so that all
    submitted papers look about the same when they open them. They expect those submitting
    papers to replace the existing text and match the style. And indeed,  when I open
    the file 15IHPS-example.doc (for instance)  I see  that the font used is Swis721
    Lt BT. That is misleading because I don't have that font on my computer, probably
    nobody else than the organizers does, and word will just apply some standard substitution
    for display; you can't rely on what you see on the screen to deduce what your
