body: "I suppose this is silly, but with all the programmers around, it seems important
  to get the terminology correct.\r\n\r\nSo, using Fontlab Studio 5.0.4, when I enter
  the correct Unicode index for the terminal sigma in Greek (U+03C2), and hit the
  little green diamond by the \"name\", I get \"sigma1\" for the name. I had always
  termed it \"sigma.terminal\". Now I know at some level the \"name\" doesn't matter,
  but it seems wise to get it right.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens with the script
  theta (U+03D1) and alternate phi (U+03D5) -- FontLab names them \"theta1\" and \"phi1\".\r\n\r\nThere
  is also a terminal iota (used in some ligatures), which I've named \"iota.terminal\",
  which would seem at variance with calling the terminal sigma \"sigma1\" -- should
  it be \"iota1\"?\r\n\r\nWhat's going on is that we're making up, for our own use,
  an OpenType version of Wilson Greek (with Matthew Carter's permission). Since there
  are a lot of ligatures in Wilson Greek, it would be nice to get the names consistent
  so I can figure out what in the world I've done wrong as I go back & fix all the
  mistakes I make in the features code.\r\n\r\n& BTW, just from a historical perspective,
  since this Greek is more of a script, I wonder why the script theta isn't the \"default.\"?
  I notice the Greek Font Society used Wilson Greek in their English volume, but used
  the U+03B8 theta.\r\n\r\nI'm putting a lot of the ligatures in Stylistic sets; Carter
  indicated that the ligatures that were used originally were the alpha_iota combinations,
  alpha_upsilon combinations, alpha-final sigma, and epsilon-iota combinations at
  the beginning of words.\r\n\r\nFollowing an idea of Nick Shinn's, lower-numbered
  stylistic sets will have these; higher numbered sets the less-used ligatures.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nCharles "

  body: "Names like sigma1, theta1 and phi1 are old Adobe Glyph List names, which
    means that they are mapped to the corresponding Unicode codepoints by Acrobat
    glyph name parsing, but you can also use uniXXXX form names for the same result.\r\n\r\nI
    usually call the terminal sigma 'sigmafinal' during development, and switch to
    'uni03C2' for font generation. 'sigma.terminal' is not a good idea, at least for
    font generation, because Acrobat will parse that as the regular sigma character,
    not the final form, since it treats the dot as indicating a glyph variant.\r\n\r\nThe
    final sigma is a distinct character in Greek text. But the variant forms of theta
    and pi, etc. that are included in Unicode are symbol characters, for mathematics
    etc., and not intended for use in regular Greek text. So my advice is to treat
    these forms as glyph variants, accessible via discretionary or contextual OpenType
    Layout features. In that case, you would name them e.g. theta.alt, phi.alt, etc.\r\n\r\nFor
    ligatures, use the _ convention, e.g. delta_alpha_uni03C2."

  body: "John,\r\n\r\nGood point on namimg the terminal sigma. I don't anticipate
    anybody taking the text from a PDF file with one of our jobs (we'll furnish XML
    for a nominal fee), but one never knows.\r\n\r\nAs to the theta: Well, yes, the
    script theta is used in mathematics, but there was a time when it was the favored
    for text -- see, for example, <cite>LES GRECS DU ROI: graves par Claude Garamont
    de 1544 a 1550 -- Tableau des Ligatures</cite>.\r\n\r\nI had rather thought the
    script theta appropriate with Wilson Greek.\r\n\r\nBest"

  body: "Thanks Adam,\r\n\r\nOur PDF files are suppose to go to the printer, and be
    a back-up archival copy of a book in case the publisher sells the rights to another
    publisher & the second publisher, for some reason, wants to try & get the text
    from the PDF file -- which requires a lot of cleanup, when you consider that all
    the footnote calls come through as regular numbers, etc. Far easier to work from
    an XML file.\r\n\r\nBut I take you point. I don't approve of sloppy fonts, and
    these days, even simple code like character names are more than a transitory part
    of the font. We are long past the Type 1 days when you had to come up with your
    own name just to encode & set the character (\"Let's see, did I name that aacutehook
    or ahookacute?\"). "

    saying that the form should not be used, but that it should be encoded as the
    theta letter character code, not as the symbol character code, and any variation
    in the form should be handled at the OpenType Layout level, not at the encoding
    level.\r\n\r\nAccording to Yannis Haralambous, there is a tradition in French
    publishing of Greek to use the open (scribal) theta at the beginning of a word
    and the closed form within a word. As far as I can tell from my analysis of older
    Greek books (e.g. Aldine or Stephani publications) the forms are mixed pretty
    freely. Indeed, I wonder if they might have been mixed in the same case compartment
    and the typesetter just used whichever he grabbed."
