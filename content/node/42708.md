  be a modified Trump Gothic East Bold for the logo.\r\nAnyone read the magazine?\r\nhttp://www.goodmagazine.com\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/good_4516.jpg]"

  body: I am not certain how the logo came to be, but cut a section out of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/alternate_gothic_no_one/?sample_text=GOOD&sample_size=144">Alternate
    Gothic No.1</a> and you're there.

    Os) = custom design\r\n\r\nThe magazine might be Good; the logo is not."

  body: "I am working at the design studio that does the design of the good magazine,\r\nWe
    didn't do the logo though. \r\n\r\nIt is custom made by a design studio called
    Area 17 ( http://www.area17.com ) and it's not a typeface, it is loosely based
    on Trade Gothic Bold Condensed No. 20 and of course some Alternate Gothic is there
    too.\r\n\r\nTrade Gothic Bold Condensed No. 20 is one of the typefaces we use
    in the magazine."

  body: Could you please ask Area 17 that they'd better pay a little more attention
    to the optical correction next time they design a logo? THX ;^)
