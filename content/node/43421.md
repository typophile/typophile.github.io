  a display face and we pretty much have freedom to do whatever we want in terms of
  design approach. I had a crazy idea of mixing Helvetica Neue with Adobe Casslon
  - Since I've always wanted a serif that's close to Neue (after working on it I realize
  how crazy this sounds). \r\n\r\nAnyhow I've continued working on it and have a very
  rough version of the lower case, perhaps you could guide me in the right direction.
  I know the last five letters don't match at all (v,w,x,y,z).\r\n\r\nAlso have a
  rough version of the uppercase but not in Fontlab yet.\r\n\r\nThanks very much :-)"

    more balanced, my eye keeps getting stuck there.\r\nAlso the tail on the a could
    do with some toning down"

    uppercase letters and updated a bit the g,p, and q.\r\n\r\nAny feedback would
    be great!"

  body: "The lc \"e\" has too thick a cross bar. \r\n\r\nThe K is WAY too heavy. Compare
    it to the Q and O. The Wi is too wide. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou might get a better result
    from drawing out the letters so they make sense as a complete shape. This feels
    a little too copied & pasted.\r\n"

  body: "I think you have a great start, but there are some elements that are throwing
    me. I think that some of the serifs on the caps are very angled. They need to
    point less out and more down. The stroke contrast seems to be too strong right
    at the top of the bowls of most lowercases.\r\n\r\nThe terminus of the lc g is
    a little odd. Maybe since its a serif, you may need to make it an eyeglass (two-story)
    g.\r\n\r\nI would love to see how this turns out."
