  body: These type-ID&#39;s sometimes suspiciously look like quick-drawing contests
    in the Old West. For a moment there, I had a vision of Cheshiredave spiralling,
    then stumbling to the ground, his pistol dangling from his hand. <BR> <BR>I think
    that&#39;s why Stephen wears a hat, so the setting desert sun doesn&#39;t blind
    him.

  body: That is exactly what happened. Of course, then there&#39;s that id in the
    latin casual thread that was started today. Nearly two hours of procrastination
    gone from my life forever, and I still can&#39;t find that damned font. I don&#39;t
    even want to go into that thread anymore.

    done.
