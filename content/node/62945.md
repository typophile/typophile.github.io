  think is the best out of the three in this image... http://onenine90.deviantart.com/art/80s-typography-139685261\r\nthe
  bottom type of the image: I couldn't find a font that closely resembled the typography
  in this (in terms of the shape, not colour): http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.ljplus.ru/img4/k/i/killacat/tb_logo_transparent_500.png
  so had to draw it myself. Does it pretty much look like the same typeface/style?\r\n\r\nAny
  help is greatly appreciated (especially constructive criticism)! Thanks!"
