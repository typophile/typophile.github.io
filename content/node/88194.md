body: "I would like to implement oldstyle kern table in order to support non-OT apps.
  The oldstyle kern table is limited to 10920 pairs. Is there any way to override
  this? \r\n\r\nAlso, when I expand class kerning, I get some pairs from different
  languages, that would never occur like /Tcaron /Aring. Is there some elegant (as
  opposed to search and delete) way to filter the pairs? Thanks!"
