  I have developed a very keen proofreaders eye. I have always been one to notice
  typos and inconsistencies in formatting. I'm not claiming to be an expert writer
  or anything of the sort, but I am usually able to pick up on mistakes that go unnoticed
  by others. I feel that this is a valuable skill and something I should play up on
  when applying for marketing and communication positions. I do not want to be a professional
  proofreader, I would just like to stress that this an \"extra\" skill I have and
  something that a might give me a leg up on another candidate.\r\n\r\nDoes this seem
  like something I should really emphasize or is it not as unique of a skill as I
  think it is? If anyone has an opinion on this or a good idea of how to incorporate
  this into a r\xE9sum\xE9 I'd appreciate the feedback."

  body: "As one that must do both for a living, I can feel the issue.\r\nUnfortunately,
    in my experience, people tend to feel uneasy in front of skills that they perceive
    as unconnected. As if one diminishes the other.\r\nThat said, your kind of skill
    becomes essential if you manage to climb the ladder and work as art director or
    similar position (not my case, unfortunately ;-).\r\n\r\nP.S.: it should be \"r\xE9sum\xE9\"
    ;-)"
