  body: "Sorry, but it's a long-standing pet peeve of mine: it's Nordstrom. I see
    they redirect nordstroms.com to nordstrom.com, but there is not and never has
    been an s at the end.\r\n\r\nAlong the same lines, I've had clients for years
    who think my company name is \"Maxgraphics.\" Ah well.\r\n"

  body: I get that sometimes with the "Mark Simonson Studio" moniker, where an "s"
    is added to make it "Studios". Makes it sound like I have dozens of employees
    over several locations, when it's just me in a single office/studio.
