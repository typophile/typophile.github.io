  body: "Edit: A Photo-Lettering specimen book from the 70s calls this typeface Graphique
    Shaded. Fast forward to the digital era: as far as I can tell from a little reading,
    Corel distributed it as Griffon. I also have an old Image Club font from 1994
    called Graphik Shadow that is almost identical.\r\n\r\nA variation on Griffon
    is available as freeware, but after my reading I'm doubtful of its legality. I've
    removed the link I originally posted (to save the moderators the trouble!).\r\n

  body: "Thanks very much for your input guys! Graphique shaded is what i've been
    looking for. I found it in an old photo-lettering book too. It's not digitally
    available though. Griffon comes pretty close, is unfortunately badly drawn. I'm
    probably looking at the free dl version as i don't have Corel. \r\n"
