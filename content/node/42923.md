body: "Hi Guys!\r\n\r\nI've been wondering for quite some time whether there is a
  satisfying solution for syncing fonts on two macs. I'm currently using FontAgentPro
  to keep my Fonts organized and I know that there is the possibility of a FontAgentProServer
  but that might be a bit over the top unless you're a design agency with 10+ employees
  imo.\r\n\r\nSyncing the FontAgentPro Folder in the Userhome directory didn't work
  since the files have to be imported in FontAgent to appear.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  any solution for this?\r\n\r\nkind regards,\r\nmike"
