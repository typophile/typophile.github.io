  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">When i export a pdf from indesign, the 'i' in the logo stands out. In the Indesign document, the logo is a vector object (not type  or placed eps). This is how the pdf looks  like in acrobat pro.

Is there a way to avoid this eyesore?

thanks,

But, if you zoom in/out, usually such glitches disappear?
It shouldn't show up in print, anyway. I'm not sure what you can do about it on screen.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Jelmar is right -- it's just an artifact of viewing a vector object at a zoom other than 100%. If you're concerned about whether the problem will occur in the real world when the logotype's at something other than actual size, you may want to make several rasterized (pixel) versions of it at a few different resolutions. Then, if any of those seem odd, you can manually adjust them in Photoshop.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you open the pdf with Illustrator does it render as a stroke? Not that I know the answer, I have had similar happen though and at some scales it looks fine. Could it be down to how you make the pdf, have you tried alternative ways of making them or alternative types of pdf (press quality, small file size, default etc.)?

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I guess the one-million-dollar question is... Does it show when you print it? It looks like your screeen shot was taken at 100%, which usually means one is seeing a fairly accurate representation of how the document will print. But I'd rather see a raster image of the .pdf transported out of Illustrator and cropped.

If it still looks ugly when you print it then there are one-million more questions that need to be answered, such as: Exactly what you mean when you say "vector object?" Was the logo created in InDesign using the vector drawing tools, or was it created in some other program and then transported in somehow? If so what was the logo's original format? I don't mean "vector", there are a bunch of different vector formats, .ai, .eps, .wmf, .pic, .myd, even .pdf itself (just to name a few). Each have varying support in Acrobat. Which one was the file originally saved as? Which version of InDesign are you using? Which version of Acrobat are you using? Which version of Distiller are you using?

There are probably more where that came from, but see how it prints first :) Good luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I had a similar problem today, added a 0,25 pt outline to a vector object (copy-pasted from Illustrator). In pdf it really stands out, but when I zoom closer it's ok. The same when the pdf is opened in Illustrator, no problem there. Could it be just that the screen doesn't show it correctly?
I haven't actually tried printing it yet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Try printing it, but it's never a good idea to copy/paste. Imports (file/place) are really the only way for InDesign & then Distiller to handle the vector algorithms correctly. If you've done that and still have problems then, as I said above, there are one-million more questions. BTW, are you sure you're using distiller and not a pdf writer?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I believe it really is just a glitch in the PDF or Acrobat rendering engine. I see it too every now and then, but I can't remember that it showed up in print.

That said, you are probably safer off if you <em>do</em> place an eps or something similar, instead of actually pasting the vectors in InDesign,  as Elizabeth already said.
At least, I always find that the conversion that takes place when pasting, is somewhat crude. I'm sure it is probably okay most of the times, but I always feel a bit uncomfortable with the results.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've noticed the same thing happening in PDF's created from Illustrator.

So far I've not had a problem with the final printing of any design that's done this on screen though.

I'm pretty certain it's a result of Adobe Reader's raster engine's preference to whole pixels for straight edges. Overall it's probably a good thing as it's possibly the only reason the address is still readable in the image you posted.

I guess it's similar to font hinting in a way, but for screen pixels instead.

If it changes at diffent zoom levels then I dont' think you have anything to worry about.

If you are using PDF's to proof the job with the client and you don't want them to see the glitch then I think converting the logo to high res pixels is the only option.</div>
