    and _R.J Laggren_ are in Unique Celtic, a font produced by W. Jackson for ATF
    in 1889. The broad top A -- us used for example in Grant Antique/Sheridan Gothic

    were popular around 1900. Still looking.\r\nDon"

  body: "No luck so far, but here is a substitute that has the angled cross strokes,
    Charcuterie Block http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/charcuterie/
    Patch the  angled cross strokes from this to a sans with letters with a compatible
    width/height/weight to the Victorian sans, perhaps PT Reforma Grotesk http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/reforma-grotesk-bold-e/
    which is based on very similar proportions of a Grotesk of the era. Widen the
    top on the _A_, clip the spur on _G_, and you have a passable substitute.\r\nAn
    alternative is Monopol http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/monopol/ which is
    not as close, but has more weights.\r\nBTW note that there are minor differences
    between your two images. Note particularly that the cross stroke on G slopes in
    the  image of the bold version but in the lighter weight\r\nDon"
