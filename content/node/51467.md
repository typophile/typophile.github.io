  used to have a scooter called a \"Zoot scoot,\" with some very fat lettering, although
  it was highly made of geometric shapes. There's some very popular fat sans-serifs
  right now (think Cooter), however they're not as easily recognizable as they should
  be.\r\n\r\nI want this to be instantly recognizable. All counters are square, or
  highly angular. Most counters are about about 75% of the size of hairlines, although
  I'm thinking about making the hairlines slightly thicker still.\r\n\r\nThe \"\xFA\"
  is replacing \"oo\" because I happen to think it looks cooler. The pronounciation
  should come out similarly, right? (not completely sure, somewhere I read that it
  makes a close sound... or maybe I assumed that from the spelling of F\xFAtbol?)"

  body: 'I really like it overall. I think some of the letters are a bit conservative,
    and some have a bit too much personality. The "T", for example, seems a bit too
    plain, like the top should be heavier. The "E", "F", and "O" seem a bit extreme
    in comparison to the T. The humps of the M are fun, but not really echoed in any
    other shapes, so I might think about making these humps less pronounced. The "R"
    and "G" are the most interesting to me, because they look genuinely wonky, in
    a good way. '

    I plan to rework this font soon, so it would probably be helpful if anyone has
    any comments or critiques.\r\n\r\nI am aware the BVXY and others are clearly too
    skinny. There are also other issues which are obvious to my eyes now.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
