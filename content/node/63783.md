  body: I feel sorry for this guy/gal. Having a badly kerned tatoo on your back forever
    must be painful. If you like tatoos (I don't), I recommend reading sang bleu.

  body: Do you call this "kerning"? I would call it bad letterspacing or just metrics.
    "Kerning", according to my use of the word, applies to instances where between
    two characters the standard metrics need to be overrided. How do you use the word
    "kerning"?
