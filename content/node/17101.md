  body: I'm going to second Tiffany's motion, both of these sites produce images in
    proper resoultion for the Mac OS which is nice. Also, if you're running dual monitors
    Mandolux is definitely the way to go!

    PowerBook's resolution just wouldn't be right :-/ (1440x900) A pity that they're
    not in Mac resolutions."

  body: "I'm always interested to see what people have on their desktop. I think it's
    a subtle statement about someone's personality & work habits. \r\n\r\nI have an
    artsy, simple photo I took and as few icons as possible -- just shortcuts to folders
    of work in progress. (Hooray for the OS X dock that hides itself away! No need
    to keep application icons on the desktop). Interesting and functional, but not
    distracting.\r\n\r\nThen there's the \"I need to keep my head clear\" school that
    goes with the blandest possible solid color to minimize visual interference. \r\n\r\nAnd
    of course, let's not forget the people who (I think) must be secretly schitzophrenic
    -- a screenful of icons over a visually detail-packed image of their children/pet/last
    vacation/over-stimulating-fill-in-the-blank."

  body: I have 0 icons on my desktop, if there are any they're only temporarily in
    that location as downloads from the internet/PDFs/etc. Any other environment annoys
    the designer-side of my brain.

  body: I keep my desktop as neutral gray as possible because if I have a color image
    to work on I don't want anything to compete with the colors in the image. As for
    screen savers I sleep my Mac.
