  body: ' Congratulations with your release! <BR> <BR>To my knowledge, this is the
    very first font in  <BR>these forums that has gone from critique to  <BR>actual
    market. &#40;If there are others, they haven&#39;t  <BR>let us know.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>I like this, however it performs much better  <BR>in limited quantities &#40;e.g.
    for navigation or  <BR>headers&#41; versus the way you show it on your  <BR>site
    as body text. <BR> <BR>You may have success including a  <BR>sample on your site  at  2x
    or even 3x scale. I  <BR>know Matthew Bardram has had success with  <BR>his bitmap
    fonts selling as display faces for  <BR>print. <BR> <BR>Good luck with it. '

  body: ' thank you... <BR>yes, i also think that it may work better for <BR>navigation
    / headlines than for body text... <BR>hopefully, people are still interested in
    those <BR>kind of fonts... '
