body: "As part of what seems to be a growing consensus around the co-existence of
  both scalable color font proposals (SVG and COLR) within the OFF/OT specs and possibly
  in some fonts as well, we\u2019re looking into having both technologies share the
  same color palettes (i.e. literally use the same color palette table \u2013 CPAL
  \u2013 in the font).\r\n \r\nThis way, CSS markup (for example) can simply refer
  to the palette-index to be used for the text, instead of separate COLR-palette-index
  and SVG-palette-index values. \r\n\r\nThis kind of abstraction of course is what
  OT is very good at, with the cmap and GSUB for example being shared across glyph
  technologies and the text engine dispatching the positioned glyph IDs at the very
  last moment, as it were, to either a CFF or TT (or SVG) renderer.\r\n\r\nAnd the
  CPAL could be extended to include name IDs that function as user-facing labels for
  color palette entries (e.g. \u201Cfloral fill\u201D, \u201Cleaf fill\u201D, \u201Coutline\u201D),
  as in the SVG table\u2019s current spec for color palettes.\r\n\r\nHowever, would
  font designers indeed want the same set of color palettes if they had both SVG and
  CPAL in their fonts? (Why both in the same font? For instance, a website could use
  a font with SVG descriptions including gradients and animation, but also include
  COLR versions of the glyphs (rendered static in flat colors in well-defined edges)
  in order to render in browsers that don't yet support SVG OT.)\r\n \r\n1. For example,
  a static SVG description of a floriated initial cap may include gradients for the
  flowers (e.g going from maroon to red to pink, with each of those colors with a
  color palette entry), whereas the \"fallback\" COLR description might simply have
  one or two of those colors as color palette entries.\r\n\r\n2. Or an animated SVG
  glyph may have more colors not in its COLR version, e.g. the dot on top of the \"i\"
  would change colors with time, each color being a palette entry, whereas the COLR
  version of the glyph would only choose one (or none) of those colors.\r\n\r\n3.
  Also, at the color meeting at TypeCon, John Hudson mentioned he could imagine a
  client wanting both COLR and SVG in a font, each for *different* ranges of characters.
  This might mean that entirely different sets of palettes are needed for different
  ranges/subsets of glyphs in the font, much like the hints in CID CFF's multiple
  dictionaries (e.g. Cyrillic vs kanji hinting). However, this complexity may not
  be worth it at this point in time.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that both technologies should
  simply share the color palettes if possible, and that fonts having both SVG and
  \"fallback\" COLR glyphs is at most a transitional necessity.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nSairus\r\n"

  body: "I think the more relevant question might be Why Not? Is there any good reason
    (technical or otherwise) that the two should have separate palette tables if they
    coexist in the same font/spec?\r\n\r\nI can only think of advantages to a single
    shared table, many of which you already touched on, including simplicity, file
    size, and end-user interaction. From the development side, I imagine a single
    shared table would be <em>much</em> easier to manage in source data.\r\n\r\nAre
    there really any potential disadvantages to a single CPAL table? Are there any
    real advantages to separate color palette tables?\r\n\r\n"

  body: In talking to other stakeholders here at Microsoft they generally agree that
    extending CPAL to make it more useful for general purpose color palette specification
    is a very good idea.
