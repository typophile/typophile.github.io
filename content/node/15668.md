  faces). Like Pringles,   Sch\xF6ffehofer Beer, etc. I am searching my memory and
  googling all around myself, but, as they say, two heads are better than one (and
  twenty two are better still!).\r\n\r\nI appreciate any help.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlexey"

    go to courts because somebody uses their faces without asking them. :/ So this
    part of the question is ok. :)\r\n\r\nThe other one \u2014 a \"graphic\" face
    as a mark, still needs more research. <a href=\"http://brandsoftheworld.com/catalogue/P/7526.html\">Paulaner</a>
    and <a href=\"http://brandsoftheworld.com/catalogue/J/107367.html\">University
    of Frankfurt</a> represent more or less what I am looking for. I have a face (3/4),
    which I want to draw using a single colour. :/ A challenge much harder that I
    thought it would be."

    for you. Just an interesting story about faces. But as you brought it up. Even
    saints have medical bills, gambling debts, money-grubbing relatives etc., ;-)
