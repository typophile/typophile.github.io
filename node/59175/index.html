I'll be in Atlanta, of course. Looking forward to seeing everyone there.

		<div class="commentbody">Program information is going up as we speak. Speakers, too.

Tuesday evening there will be an unofficial pre-conference kickoff at Creative Circus, including an open house, some nibbles, and a presentation on drawing scripts and flourishes that everyone can get involved in. Bring your sketchbook.

Paul Shaw has indicated that he may do a typographic walking tour in Atlanta (free). We're thinking it might be Wednesday morning. But he's not arriving until Tuesday, and we probably won't have a commitment before boots-on-the-ground. So this will be ad hoc.

Pre-conference workshops start on Wednesday (all this info is up). 

On Tuesday and Wednesday, all us volunteers will be busily landing and putting things together. If you're around and want to pitch in, come find me or Michelle Hill, introduce yourself, and we'll see what we can do to plug you in.

Official conference registration won't start until sometime on Wednesday.

Hope this is helpful.</div>

Will Powers can tell us how he feels in Mexico City, but from my perspective is like visiting New York: tourists must be careful, keep away from potentially dangerous zones, etc. But it’s not that hard, and both cities are plenty of marvelous things to see and to do.

I’ll be very glad to see you in October.</div>

I don’t like to continue talking about Mexico security in a TypeCon thread, but…

I insist: I’m not saying we don’t have security problems, and to be honest the problem you are talking about is real, but again: I’ve never been kidnapped in a taxi after 30 years of taking them (and I hope this good luck will continue in the future).

If you’re interested, I can provide you with some telephone numbers to get a safe taxi service. If you are kidnapped in a taxi in Mexico City after this, I pay the rescue. ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@ Cristobal and James: There are in many peoples' minds strong worries about visiting Mexico City. Many of these worries have some validity, and are hard to dislodge. But I think James over-states the case a bit. To attend ATypI in the historic center of Mexico City, and to be in the streets in groups, and to pay attention to your surroundings will keep almost all risk at bay.

I'm not well-traveled, so I cannot offer any comparisons with other big cities. Outside the USA the only big cities I've been to are Halifax [not all that big], Montreal, Vancouver, and Mexico City. I do not like cities, but in Mexico City I feel relaxed and calm; and safe. My wife and I walk all over the city or take the metro and busses. Very late at night we have friends or a maitre d' call us a safe cab.

I've never met Cristobal, but after a side comment I made in a thread somewhere a while ago about a long walk we took across Mexico City on a Sunday morning, he must think my wife & I are gringos locos. In October I'll tell him about our late-night walk from Tlalpan to our hotel on Periferco Sur. Then he'll know I'm loco.

Hell, James: I even worry about being in Minneapolis at times. You survived that trip.

I wouldn't go so far as saying TypeCon represents the typography industry. Except for a few major players usually in attendance, I think it would be more accurate to say that TypeCon represents the hobby arm of the typographic world. My last attendance in Boston bore this out. 4 hours of Dwiggins, and 20 minutes on Font Licenses.

		<div class="commentbody">James, you have a point, but "hobby arm" is not a correct characterization. My impression is that the vast majority of those attending are either professionally involved with type, or are students planning to be. Most, it is true, are graphic designers, with an interest in type, maybe having drawn some type themselves, but not full time type designers. That reflects the name of the society: "Society of Typographic Aficionados". 

However, full time type designers are there in significant numbers, and a good chunk of talks are by and of interest to type designers. For example, I am looking forward to the Gerard Unger & Friends panel, and to Gerry Leonides on "What I have learned about Type", as well as the panel on fonts for the Web, which seems to be the current hot issue for the type design industry. 

So while it's true that TypeCon doesn't have the technical and business issues of professional type designers as its primary and exclusive focus, it does include those issues, and it brings type designers together with their customers. And that is a service to type designers as well as graphic designers.

Be happy to introduce you to anyone I know. Also, you will find that everyone there is very approachable and happy to talk to you. I am sure your wife will find friendly people to talk to--even about other things than type! :-)

		<div class="commentbody">I'll be at Typecon this year, and I cannot wait for it to begin. I have only been once before, but my impression has been that it is industry enough. Sure, there are conferences that are more industry, insider, and specific. But Typecon is well-organized, interesting, and quite enjoyable. But if you are interested in the specifics of the type business or finding font work, the best discussions at Typecon--just like any other conference--are most likely to occur offline, not onstage in the main hall. </div>

I couldn't disagree more Bill. I doubt there is much real business getting conducted between type designers and all those type design customers you seem to think are there. Like you said there are a lot of type designers in attendance. Type designers are not other type designers customers. 

It is a social occasion, not much more. And there is nothing wrong with that. But is very little to do with type designers getting in touch with their customers.

That counts for something! I guess you disagree?</div>

Wow. I assure you such business does occur. Perhaps whether one is involved in those discussions or not has something to do with one's attitude.

Really, James. Did representatives from SOTA and ATypI each visit your home and urinate directly in your breakfast cereal? Your distorted view of reality is surprising, not to mention a bit offensive to the hundreds of speakers and volunteers who bust their asses each year.

I was going to list all the TypeCon sessions from the past 3 years that relate directly to type designers and their industry but then I realized you'd be the only one who needed convincing. For those who are truly interested, the record is there: [[TypeCon]].</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rich -- I, too, am glad to hear you're coming. 

TypeCon is only one slice of the type universe -- part industry, part hobbyist. I tend to think of it as akin to a flesh-and-blood* Typophile for a few days a year. 

* (What's the appropriate antonym to 'virtual' in this context? 'Real' doesn't quite seem to work.)

Please make a point of introducing yourself to me. I'll be happy to make further introductions. 

It won't be hard to find me, since I'm very visible in my official role(s). But I tend to get a little caught up in the work and don't always register meeting people from Typophile, so you may have to penetrate through my busy-ness to make the connection. I'll thank you for it.

That goes for any fellow Typophiles who are coming. If I seem pre-occupied or brusque at all, don't be put off. Please don't be shy. Come up and say something.

After last year (unavoidable time conflict), I was determined to get down to Atlanta, but my finances have since deteriorated to the point where it may be several years before I travel further than NYC (and strictly a daytrip at that).

Then again, if I had to pick a final Typecon to attend, it could not have been a better one than Boston in '06, where the organizers were so wonderful to me. I'll never forget it. Good luck to all, and continued success to SoTA.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm 99% sure that I won't be at TypeCon this year, a decision I made before the speaker and content information was available and which I am now regretting for a number of reasons.

In regard to what James has written, in some respects I agree with him, particularly with regard to the amount of serious business that takes place at TypeCon, but this was a criticism I long made of ATypI, which used to purport to be a professional association. TypeCon, at least, has no such pretensions. But I disagree with James that the lack of business reduces the event to a solely or primarily social function. I consider a conference good if I learn some things and have some good conversations about type: the educational component is what I value. As the years go by, the opportunities to learn something new diminish, although the quality of those opportunities, when they do occur, tends to be high. Even when I don't find much to interest me personally, it would be churlish to criticise an event if it offers opportunities to those younger and less experienced.

I have attended three TypeCon conferences: Minneapolis, Seattle and Buffalo. I had fun in Minneapolis but didn't learn much of anything and wasn't very impressed by what was on offer in general. It was pretty lame, which is why I didn't bother with the next couple of years. Seattle and Buffalo were both very good conferences though, among the best type conferences I have attended in the past fifteen years. I learned lots and had some good conversations.</div>
