  be lovely to find something with a bit more \"ink\" and less air around it, just
  a bit more compact. And perhaps an alternative with a broader uppercase S.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  the bold isn't very bold.\r\n\r\nAnyone?\r\n\r\nEDIT: A family with small letters
  and not just uppercase letters would be fantastic."
