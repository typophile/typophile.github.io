  body: "Not certain this one was an actual font, perhaps from the dry transfer lettering
    era, but I can say that the lettering design is derived from the Viennese Secession
    poster lettering of Alfred Roller before WW I, which returned to popularity in
    the 1960s and spawned many hand-lettered psychedelic posters. Roller style fonts

  body: "Hi Paulo\r\nI'm disappointed that the experts on dry transfer lettering of
    the 60s and 70s did not contribute to this discussion.\r\nThis looks like something
    that Albert Bolton, Tom Carnase, or Leslie Carbaga might have done for one of
    these companies.\r\nAnyway, I love the letters. Do you have any more?\r\nDon"

  body: "EDITED:\r\nGood find Dick.\r\nSome further research shows that B\xFCro Destruct
    created the font BD Calamares [i.e. squid] based on the lettering on a record
    cover named _Allez Servette_ released by M-Records in 1977, which a team song
    [or songs]  for a Swiss soccer team [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AllezServetteM-Records1977_5733.jpg]
    http://45football.com/index.php?id=38\r\n\r\nNote that the lettering is all lower
    case. The letters in _alpendr_ which differ from BD Calamares are the ones not
    included in the _Allez Servette_, i.e. _d_, _n_ and _p_. Obviously B\xFCro Destruct
    modelled its version of _d_, and _p_ on the other letters shown on the record
    cover, which use curved tunnels to reach the inner circles. B\xFCro Destruct did,
    however, use the straight tunnel used in _v_ which to create an _n_ that is somewhat
    similar to the _n_ that they did not have available as a model.\r\n\r\nI believe
    that M-Records used the same dry transfer lettering, or photo-lettering, that
    was used to make the word or partial word _alpendr_. Perhaps this word is derived
    from alpine? Together with the choice of these letters for a Swiss soccer team,
    this suggests that the creator of the rub-on or photo lettering might have been
    a Swiss company, perhaps included in this listing http://issuu.com/csisson/docs/u_lc_vol.20-2/43\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone have any suggestions as to the mystery maker?\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"
