  hereby take the pleasure to announce the release of my new <strong>ARTHUR</strong>
  font series.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_arthur-s_1-1a_5289.png]\r\n\r\nIt
  was obviously inspired by the elegance and sophistication\r\nof the Art Deco era
  \u2026\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_arthur-C_7_5370.png]\r\n\r\n\u2026
  the classical age of  travel and of the dawn of modern globalization.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_arthur-C_6a_5723.png]\r\n\r\nThere
  are two seperate sets of fonts: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/arthur-sans/|<strong>Arthur
  Sans</strong>]] (in 5 weights) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/arthur-cabinet/|<strong>Arthur
  Cabinet.</strong>]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_arthur-C_3b_4840.png]\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
  a seperate font, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/arthur-ornaments/|<strong>Arthur
  Ornaments,</strong>]] is available:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_arthur-s_1-6_6612.png]\r\n\u2026
  offering about 70 glyphs with florals, borderpieces, travel, sports and lifestyle
  pics.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_arthur-Orn_4_5726.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_arthur-Orn_5_3962.png]\r\n\r\nThank
  you all typophiles who favourably [[http://typophile.com/node/98908|commented on
  the drafts]] during the last two months.\r\n\r\nFinally, a glimpse on some preceding
  sketches.\r\nI hope you enjoy it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arthurentw_sw_m_1_5657.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arthurentw_sw_m_2_3457.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arthurentw_sw_m_8_3462.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_arthur-Orn_1A_5778.png]"

    elegance, sophistication.\r\n\r\nSeeing your work in progress made me wonder about
    a Sketch weight, with some of the rougher charm of your drawings."

    option, certainly. Not sure though how well this would work for the entire scope
    of such a font \u2026\r\nI particularily enjoyed making the doodles. Many of them
    had been sketched initially.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arthurentw_sw_m_5_4847.png]"
