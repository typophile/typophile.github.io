  the type originally used. I think it's a version of a 'Lombard' font, and I'm pretty
  sure Letraset used to sell it years ago. \r\n\r\nThe original artwork was designed
  in 1995, and may have been produced on a Mac.\r\n\r\nI've attached a sample-[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flame

  body: "Aquitaine Initials has some similar letterforms among the alternates, but
    I don't think that's your answer. Actually, I would have thought this was hand-drawn,
    because there seem like too many variations of letters.\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Yeah, I agree - that doesn't look like a font. The closest thing I know of
    is the uppercase of <a href='URLhttp://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/jfs/jester.htm'
    target='_blank'>Cotswold</a> (lowercase for 'in') with the decorative frames removed.
