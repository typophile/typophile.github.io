body: Should numbers be tabular or proportional by default? &#40;Assuming the font
  is OpenType format&#41; Or does it really matter? <BR>What characters besides numerals
  need to be set on the same width for tabular lining? &#40;dollar, Euro, yen, sterling,
  period &#40;decimal&#41;, comma, fractions, others???&#41;

  body: 'I&#39;d say it depends on the use for which the type is designed. <BR>If
    your goal is mainly long text: do proportional. If you think it&#39;ll <BR>be
    used most often in forms and data: tabular. If you want it to <BR>be used for
    both, you really need both.'

  body: thanks, Stephen. I think i&#39;ll go with proportional as the default and
    tabular as one of the OT features.

  body: From a user&#39;s pov, I really appreciate when typefaces include both. Not
    all of us like to set business cards with oldstyle numbers, too much dancing.
    Of course, that is only one instance and I&#39;m probably in the minority.

  body: thanks for the info, Charles. that was rather insightful, especially the part
    about actually redrawing figures for tabular settings. &#40;it was too much common
    sense for me think of that!&#41; do you know of anyone else who follows this practice?
    <BR> <BR>oh and you can usually just ignore those error messages. just make sure
    you copy your posting, back out of the message and then go back in to double check
    that it actually posted.

  body: Paul, <BR>It is hard to read your user&#39;s intentions when designing a typeface.  If
    your intent is to make your font more marketable to everyone, I would suggest
    including both lining and oldstyle figures.  If you must choose one, I would make
    it lining but at a height somewhere between cap height and x-height.  This makes
    the numbers less obtrusive in the text but still allows for the tables found in
    annual reports and price catalogues. Like Tiffany, I think business cards set
    in oldstyle can be disruptive when you have so many phone numbers and addresses
    and zip codes all packed into such a small size card.  This again is the users
    choice and why having both sets is always the best solution. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: 'It depends on the style/usage of the font. <BR>In general, for a text face
    I would make one or both of two main styles: hybrid proportional, and 3/4-lining
    fixed-width. And unless the caps are very short I wouldn&#39;t align the latter
    with them &#40;in general&#41;. This will cover you 90%. BTW, see de Groot&#39;s
    numerals for the best in the west. <BR> <BR>As for non-numeric characters that
    might benefit from having a relationship with a fixed-width numeral width, certainly
    the currencies should be that width - and here&#39;s a trick I learned from JF:
    make stuff like commas and periods &#40;and the en dash&#41; exactly <i>half</i>
    that width, and make the blank space character that width too. That way you can
    easily pad the widths as necessary. <BR> <BR>&#42; Actually, you would of course
    determine the space first and then double it to get the fixed-width for the numerals.

  body: Paul, my suggestion would be to include every possible numeric format in the
    OpenType font. Then, the user has everything to choose from. If that means ten
    different numeric styles, then so be it &#40;as long as you can program that&#41;!
    <BR> <BR>And I, for one, enjoy seeing all of your questions. Keep &#39;em coming!
