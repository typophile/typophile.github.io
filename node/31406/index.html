The onefitted is the proportional version of the numeral one.

But as Nick says, you can learn a lot just by looking at the glyphs in an existing font.

please don't use the glyph names from the "Adobe OT PS Standard Names (CFF)" encoding. Weird as it may seem, they're not compatible with Adobe's current recommendations for glyph naming. This encoding lists names that are internally represented by numbers rather than names in a CFF table.

		<div class="commentbody">Adam,

That's not quite right. The correct thing to say is, do not use the “Adobe OT PS Standard Names (CFF)” encoding. This is because it is safe to use glyph names from that encoding, <strong>as long as</strong> they're also present in the <em>Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts</em> http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/aglfn13.txt

This means that, only the glyph names listed below should NOT be used.

<em>Note:</em> <strong>fi</strong> and <strong>fl</strong> are between parentheses because Mac OS X (as of 10.4.8) still relies in glyph names (instead of the 'cmap' table). This means that if the font doesn't contain these two glyph names, the OS will perform font-flaback on the characters U+FB01 and U+FB02.

		<div class="commentbody">William, you can find Adobe's recommendations for glyph names on these two pages:

— <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_glyph.html">Unicode and Glyph Names</a>
— <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_glyph2.html">Glyph Names and Current Implementations</a>

The short answer is, read <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_glyph.html#6">section 6</a> of Unicode and Glyph Names page.

For small caps*, for example, <strong>a.small</strong>, <strong>aacute.sc</strong>, or <strong>agrave.smcp</strong> are all sound names.

* If you care about unique glyph-character correspondence, you'll need to have two sets of small cap glyphs: one that matches the lowercase set, and another that matches the uppercase set. This means you'll end up with two small cap 'A's, one named <strong>a.sc</strong>, and another named <strong>A.sc</strong>. The first should be used in the 'smcp' feature, and the second in the 'c2sc' feature, as the code below illustrates:

<code>feature smcp {
sub a by a.sc;
} smcp;

feature c2sc {
sub A by A.sc;
} c2sc;</code></div>

In environments where character codes (Unicode codepoints) need to be reconstructed from glyph names — like when copying text from a PDF, for example — the text string 'AAA' styled with your 'c2sc' feature, will end up being converted to 'aaa', because that's the result of parsing '/a.sc/a.sc/a.sc'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, 

as Miguel said, for casing features, you have three choices: 

1. Duplicate your small caps glyphs so that there is one set that corresponds to lowercase glyphs, with names such as "a.smcp", "agrave.smcp" (or "a.small", "agrave.small" or "a.sc", "agrave.sc" but *not* "asmall" or "agravesmall") and one set that corresponds to UPPERCASE glyphs, with names such as "A.c2sc", "Agrave.c2sc" (or "A.smcp", "Agrave.smcp" or "A.small", "Agrave.small" or "A.sc", "Agrave.sc" but *not* "Asmall" or "Agravesmall"). In such case, the "smcp" feature would replace "a" with "a.smcp" and the "c2sc" feature would replace "A" with "A.c2sc". 

2. Have one set of small caps glyphs named as if they were variants of UPPERCASE glyphs, i.e. "A.smcp", "Agrave.smcp" (or "A.small", "Agrave.small" or "A.sc", "Agrave.sc" but *not* "Asmall" or "Agravesmall"). In such case, the "smcp" would replace lowercase with those glyphs, and the "c2sc" feature would replace uppercase with those glyphs. 

3. Have one set of small caps glyphs named as if they were variants of lowercase glyphs, i.e. "a.smcp", "agrave.smcp" (or "a.small", "agrave.small" or "a.sc", "agrave.sc" but *not* "asmall" or "agravesmall"). In such case, the "smcp" would replace lowercase with those glyphs, and the "c2sc" feature would replace uppercase with those glyphs. 

Adobe follows variant 1, which allows them 100% glyph correspondence. With class kerning and composites, handling these duplicate glyphs is pretty easy in the production process. Also, it's easier to write OpenType Layout features because your font would have suplicate "S.c2sc" and "s.smcp" (as there is both "S" and "s" in your font), but you'd only need "germandbls.smcp" as there is only "germandbls" without an uppercase variant). 

With this variant, if my source text reads "The typeface Constantia was designed by John Hudson" and I style "Constantia" and "John Hudson" with "all small caps" (i.e. both "c2sc" and "smcp" are applied), the document goes to PDF and is then retrieved by Acrobat or Google, the text will still read "The typeface Constantia was designed by John Hudson", so there is no semantic loss. 

Variant 2 is also acceptable. If my source text reads "The typeface Constantia was designed by John Hudson" and I style "Constantia" and "John Hudson" with "all small caps", the retrieved text will read "The typeface CONSTANTIA was designed by JOHN HUDSON". There is some semantic loss but all-uppercase text is always orthographically correct. (After all, small caps are just smaller-sized lowercase letters)

Variant 3 is the least preferrable. If my source text reads "The typeface Constantia was designed by John Hudson" and I style "Constantia" and "John Hudson" with "all small caps", the retrieved text will read "The typeface constantia was designed by john hudson". This semantic loss is unacceptable becauase all-lowercase text is not orthographically correct in this case. 

As or the glyphname suffixes, you can use whatever you want: "a.smcp", "a.small", "a.sc", "a.SMALLC" etc. are all acceptable for the small caps "a" glyph. "one.onum", "one.osf", "one.oldstyle", "one.lc", "one.o" are all acceptable for the old-style/lowercase figure 1. 

Fontlab Ltd. recommends to use glyphname suffixes that are tied to OpenType Layout feature tags that the glyphs are used in (or primarily used in). So if you follow variant 1 of devising small caps (duplicate sets), You can name the glyphs "A.c2sc" and "a.smcp". Then it's instantly obvious that the OpenType Layout feature definition will be

<code>feature c2sc {
  sub A by A.c2sc; 
} c2sc; 

feature smcp {
  sub a by a.smcp; 
} smcp; </code>

If your font has just two sets of figures (lining with Unicode codepoints, and oldstyle as variants), You can name the oldstyle figures "one.onum" so the feature definition would be: 

<code>feature onum {
  sub one by one.onum; 
} onum; </code>

If a glyph is only accessed through a combination of features, e.g. if you have four sets of figures (tabular lining, tabular oldstyle, proportional lining, proportional oldstyle), you can use the names "one" (for the tabular lining), "one.onum_tnum" (for the tabular oldstyle), "one.lnum_pnum" (for the proportional lining) and "one.onum_pnum" (for the proportional oldstyle). In the suffix, you can concatenate the OpenType Layout tags using underscore, and the sequence of these layout tags are alphabetical. Similarly, if you have a stylistic variant of a small caps "R", you can call it "R.c2sc_ss01". 

If the same glyph is used in several features independantly (e.g. a stylistic variant of "R" could be used in "ss01" and "salt"), you can pick the suffix that is most specifically tied to the glyph. "ss01" seems to be more specific that "salt" so you can call the glyph "R.ss01". 

When it comes to ligatures, Fontlab Ltd. currently recommends using suffixes in these as well. The standard "fi" ligature can be named "f_i.liga" while a discretionary "st" ligature can be named "s_t.dlig". This keeps your glyphnames in order and allows you to quickly allocate the ones you need. 

For localized glyph variants, Fontlab Ltd. suggests using the OpenType language tag, i.e. the Serbian "b" glyph would be named "afii10066.SRB".

Just a small note to say, although 'afii10066' is a perfectly legal glyph name, Adobe is moving away from afiiXXXXX glyph names, in favour of uniXXXX (or uXXXX*) names. So in the case above 'afii10066.SRB' can be replaced by 'uni0431.SRB' or 'u0431.SRB'.

Following the OT numeral feature logic, to address tabular oldstyle figures, both tnum and onum features need to be applied by the application. So mentioning both these features in the glyph name makes this obvious. The table should be:

width:
pnum = proportional
tnum = tabular
(Each of these features however covers both lnum and onum.)

alignment:

I can't guarantee that things won't change in the future. All I can say is that this is the current best practice. Nonetheless, the glyph naming conventions outlined in the links above are pretty solid, so I'd say things are likely not to change significantly in the near future.

No no no no :) 

There are two typographic properties of figures: 
a) case, i.e. vertical size and alignment, which can be uppercase (lining) or lowercase (oldstyle/floating)
b) width, which can be monospaced (tabular) or proportional. 
These properties are controlled *independently* of each other by OpenType Layout features. 

The "onum" feature switches UC figures (*lnum) to lc figures (*onum). The "lnum" does the reverse. 

The "pnum" feature switches monospaced figures (*tnum) to proportional figures (*pnum). The "tnum" feature does the reverse. 

If your font has four sets of figures (uppercase monospaced, uppercase proportional, lowercase monospaced and lowercase proportional): 

* the "onum" feature switches from uppercase monospaced to lowercase monospaced and from uppercase proportional to lowercase proportional; 
* the "lnum" feature switches from lowercase monospaced to uppercase monospaced and from lowercase proportional to uppercase proportional; 
* the "pnum" feature switches from uppercase monospaced to uppercase proportional and from lowercase monospaced to lowercase proportional; 
* the "tnum" feature switches from uppercase proportional to uppercase monospaced and from lowercase proportional to lowercase monospaced; 

So, conceptually, you have four sets of figures: 
* "onum_tnum": lowercase monospaced,
* "onum_pnum": lowercase proportional, 
* "lnum_tnum": uppercase monospaced, 
* "lnum_pnum": uppercase proportional. 

*One* of these figure sets would be your *default* figure set, for which you wouldn't use a glyphname suffix and you would assign the Unicode codepoints to them. These could be the uppercase monospaced figures, but could be also a different figure set. For the three remaining sets, you'd use glyphname suffixes. 

If you have four figure sets, each of the four features (onum, pnum, lnum, tnum) should *always* substitute two sets by two other sets.

		<div class="commentbody">A postscriptum to Miguel's posting:

According to the more strict Adobe policy (which separates glyphs inserted through OpenType Layout from glyphs inserted through their Unicode codepoints), your font should have two sets of identical (duplicate) superscript and subscript figures, named and encoded as shown below. This encoding and naming ensures that the original text string will always be accurately reconstructed.  

(U+2070) "uni2070" and duplicated as (unencoded) "zero.sups"
(U+00B9) "onesuperior" and duplicated as (unencoded) "one.sups"
(U+00B2) "twosuperior" and duplicated as (unencoded) "two.sups"
(U+00B3) "threesuperior" and duplicated as (unencoded) "three.sups"
(U+2074) "uni2074" and duplicated as (unencoded) "four.sups"
(U+2075) "uni2075" and duplicated as (unencoded) "five.sups"
(U+2076) "uni2076" and duplicated as (unencoded) "six.sups"
(U+2077) "uni2077" and duplicated as (unencoded) "seven.sups"
(U+2078) "uni2078" and duplicated as (unencoded) "eight.sups"
(U+2079) "uni2079" and duplicated as (unencoded) "nine.sups"
(U+2080) "uni2080" and duplicated as (unencoded) "zero.sinf"
(U+2081) "uni2081" and duplicated as (unencoded) "one.sinf"
(U+2082) "uni2082" and duplicated as (unencoded) "two.sinf"
(U+2083) "uni2083" and duplicated as (unencoded) "three.sinf"
(U+2084) "uni2084" and duplicated as (unencoded) "four.sinf"
(U+2085) "uni2085" and duplicated as (unencoded) "five.sinf"
(U+2086) "uni2086" and duplicated as (unencoded) "six.sinf"
(U+2087) "uni2087" and duplicated as (unencoded) "seven.sinf"
(U+2088) "uni2088" and duplicated as (unencoded) "eight.sinf"
(U+2089) "uni2089" and duplicated as (unencoded) "nine.sinf"

(The ".sups" and ".sinf" suffixes can be anything else, e.g. ".superior" and ".inferior" etc.)

A more economic way would be just one set of glyphs (just like you'd only use one set of small cap glyphs, "A.smcp"). This naming and encoding does not guarantee 100% reconstruction of the original string (because e.g. U+2070 will be reconstructed as U+0030). 

(U+2070) "zero.sups"
(U+00B9) "one.sups or "onesuperior"
(U+00B2) "two.sups" or "twosuperior"
(U+00B3) "three.sups" or "threesuperior"
(U+2074) "four.sups"
(U+2075) "five.sups"
(U+2076) "six.sups"
(U+2077) "seven.sups"
(U+2078) "eight.sups"
(U+2079) "nine.sups"
(U+2080) "zero.sinf"
(U+2081) "one.sinf"
(U+2082) "two.sinf"
(U+2083) "three.sinf"
(U+2084) "four.sinf"
(U+2085) "five.sinf"

There's something wrong here.
There's no need for all this redundancy in the font -- why can't the layout application use Unicode codepoints for determining OpenType layout features?

<em>No no no no :)</em>

Adam, Karsten, I understand the principle of "two variables produces four instances", and have made dozens of OT fonts with four sets of figures that work just fine.

I came to the conclusion that
"onum = oldstyle + proportional"
by looking at the way characters were named in Adobe fonts, i.e. "oneoldstyle", and <em>figured</em> the rest out from there.

Looks like Adobe made a mistake by coming up with run-on names such as "asmall", "oneinferior", and "oneoldstyle" -- so don't roll your eyes at me, and how about admitting it?

***

Adam, please stop refering to "monospaced", "lowercase" and "uppercase" figures.
The correct terms are "tabular", "oldstyle" and "lining", cast in concrete as OpenType features! 
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm

What is the point of having standards if you don't stick with them?

You guys are making this up as you go along, changing your minds all the time.

Now I have to encode a simple "alternate set" as:

- Salt
- Titling
- SS01

...just to get it to work in past, present, and future versions of CS software!

Sure, it's software, and the bugs can always be fixed, but this thing is getting out of hand -- the kind of glyph proliferation that has been happening to the *ideal* opentype font in recent months is ridiculous. It's coming at me from every direction -- language support, legacy application support, "reconstruction" support. 

What type designers -- and the font industry -- need is some good standard templates, not to have to figure things out for themselves on constantly shifting terrain.</div>

Sorry, I know. I just feared the table would irritate people who still have to fumble out how it works. (The logic of numeral feature styles is rather strange at first glance.)

<cite>What type designers — and the font industry — need is some good standard templates, not to have to figure things out for themselves on constantly shifting terrain.</cite>

My impression is that this will continue to be the status quo until finally Microsoft will come up with truely OT-savvy* applications (not a mere WPF, but WPF used by Word &c) -- of course with their own interface to access OT features. And it may take one or two more steps until Apple, Adobe, MS finally assimilate their slightly different approaches, so that user can use OT fonts the same way throughout different OSses and applications. No idea what this means in terms of years.
Prove that I am wrong and I'll be happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, 

did you test your fonts in various applications that support advanced typographic OpenType Layout features, or just in Adobe applications? One shouldn't presume that one particular implementation is enough to test against. (For example, do you test your features in TextEdit on Mac OS X 10.4? Or in Mellel?) BTW, I'm not implying that there is something wrong with *your* fonts. I haven't seen your OT code, and perhaps everything is all-right with it. 

"You guys are making this up as you go along, changing your minds all the time." — I read some bitterness in what you're saying, but I believe you're being a bit naiive. I think you expect that some superminds behind the scenes had figured everything out back in 1999 (when OpenType was introduced), envisioned all kinds of typographic uses and cases for the layout features, all kinds of problems that a developer may run into. But of course, this was never the case. In the past years, OpenType has always been a work in progress. This is normal: when the specification was written, there were practically no applications that used it (except the Microsoft complex-script engines for Arabic, Indic scripts etc.), and there were only a handful fonts. When you look at the features as they were defined in Adobe Garamond Pro (one of the first OpenType fonts made by Adobe) and in Palatino Linotype (one of the first OpenType fonts with advanced typographic features made by Microsoft), there are a *lot* of bad practices. 

I'm a person who's been trying to monitor whatever the "big guys" (Adobe, Microsoft, Apple) are doing, communicate with some independent developers (such as John Hudson), add my modest bit of knowledge about typesetting practice and about linguistic aspects, and distill this into designer-comprehensible talk. What I'm suggesting are "best practices as I see them", or perhaps "best practices as Fontlab Ltd. sees them". There is a certain amount of subjectivity -- you can always do this or that *differently* if you know why you're doing this. There are cases where you don't want to supply glyphnames at all in your fonts, there are cases where you want to write some features differently from what I recommend etc. I've done some thinking about this topic, but everyone is welcome, or actually even encouraged, to do his own thinking. 

You're free to accept my advice, and you're free to reject it. You're welcome and encourage to comment and challenge my advice and my thinking -- as I never claimed that I know it all. 

Best, 
Adam

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not bitter Adam, just frustrated working on the never-ending font, as I discover something new each month that should be included or changed. 

But perhaps I'm naiive, in wanting to produce fonts that function perfectly, as that no longer appears to be possible, and they're turning into just another piece of buggy software that needs constant upgrades to keep all the features working properly and in sync with applications. 

I treat your recommendations very seriously, and as I've said before, you are in the perfect position, with FontLab, to take the lead and establish some standardized OpenType font formats that independent foundries can use. Nobody wants to be the little shop whose customers have to figure out its quirks. And the customers -- the typographers -- would like to see some consistency, so that they don't have to read a pdf manual for each font just to figure out how the features of Foundry A differ from Foundry B.

I'd love to be able to scroll down to a "FontLab Latin Text" codepage and have all the characters (including smcp, sinf, sups, etc.) pop up in grey, with proper unicoding and feature sets pre-built. The I click on "one.superior", and FontLab renders a scaled, positioned version of the "one.lnum_pnum" glyph in the character position. Pre-built family-naming would be handy too.

How much would you be willing to pay for this functionality?

seriously, there are various options available -- scripts and extension files provided by indepenetent developers, core functionality within FontLab Studio, a separate tool. They could be custom-tailored or general-use.

Although there are things that have changed, including Adobe's choices for glyph names, there has never been any significant change in how we associate glyphs and features in this area (onum/tnum/lnum/pnum). Not since we shipped our first featureful OpenType fonts seven years ago.
