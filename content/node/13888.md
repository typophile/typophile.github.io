  designer, Jim Rimmer, is a rare typographic craftsman who is fully at ease cutting
  metal typefaces by hand and working the same designs with Bezier Curves on a Macintosh
  computer. Jim has designed typefaces for his own books that he designs, illustrates,
  prints and occasionally writes himself. His output approaches [[Frederic Goudy]]'s
  in volume and quality.\r\nMr.Rimmer has digitized several Goudy faces for Lanston
  and continues to assist in the evolution of [[Lanston Type Co.]] In January of 2006,
  Mr. Rimmer's designs were released through [[P22 Type Foundry|P22]] under the name
  of the [[Rimmer Type Foundry]].\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12554\">Jim
