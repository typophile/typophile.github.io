  rim glasses, gentleman of the 60s feeling.  I LOVE Lubalin Graph but it's not wide
  enough and Hellenic Wide is too 'country.'  Any alternate ideas?  Is there a super
  wide Futura or something equally mod/scifi/60s?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "Keep in mind that much of Lubalin Graph's character comes from the fact that
    it's a geometric (the rounds are \"perfect\" circles). Once you go wide, you get
    ovals. You might want something more square like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/dispatch_extended/\">Dispatch
    Extended</a>, which is less country than Hellenic.\r\n\r\nAs for sans serifs,
    there's nothing more mod/scifi/60s than <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/eurostile_std_ot_virtual/\">Eurostile</a>.
