  design business and I started with the logo design. I'm fresh out of high school
  and I plan on majoring in graphic design in college, but I want to get my business
  up and running as soon as I can. I really just want to get my foot in the door and
  snag some potential clients. I have created a simplistic logo for my company Midair,
  and needed some critiques and opinions!\r\n"

  body: I think if you're going to increase the lettering gradually like that, the
    weight should remain constant. Also, the clouds need a different layout to it.

    Etah, what do you mean by a different layout? Could you elaborate?

    cloud. \r\nAlso that cloud doesn't fit with the type. It might be the strokes
    of the cloud."

  body: "Ok. @thegirlinmidair needs some guidance here. Apparently. This may seem
    like a good start but hrant made a good suggestion related to type. If you're
    going for the \"midair\" logo, this doesn't really look like mid air. It looks
    very firmly on the ground because of the very prominent bottom line. That gets
    more and more thick as you move to the right. To me this looks like a locomotive
    because it feels very heavy and has smoke coming from the front and getting backwards.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to create something \"midair\" I'd suggest for a more playful touch on
    letters where they're disjoint, and feel more like bubbles in the air. Different
    sizes (but try not to variate too much so you can keep uniform weight) and different
    sqew, rotation etc.\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to make the feel of being \"midair\"
    you will have to present some roundness below as well, so it will feel like in
    the air. And make sure you adjust cloud stroke style with your lettering. I guess
    that's one of the things that @hrant wanted to say by saying \"much polish needed\".\r\n\r\nKeep
    on the good work, try to keep wide minded about our suggestions and don't jump
    too hastily to rejected ideas. Try to work on them and not just replace type and
    see if it works. Every change usually brings more work than just changing a single
    element."

  body: Litera, thanks for the critique. That makes much more sense now. I definitely
    see where you and hrant are coming from now. I was just so set on that logo that
    I was being close-minded and resistant to suggestions when I clearly asked for
    them in the first place. I now see that I have much more work to do!

  body: "When I think about \"mid-air\" I think of a lot of action being involved,
    so why not use some cartoon \"motion lines\" to give your logo a more in-the-air
    feel.   I grabbed my stylus and tablet and drew something quick to show what I
    mean.   The result is far too busy and needs simplification for my taste, but
    it gives you the idea. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/midair-action_6156.jpg]"

  body: I like your concept but the execution needs work. I agree with Litera - it
    also made me think of trains due to the heaviness of the design. Look at photos
    and illustrations of clouds to help you, perhaps even vintage travel posters for
    a simple stylized cloud.

    came to my mind was a brand of \"bubblabath\". The script works with the clouds,
    the round shapes and cheerful bouncyness, but it also makes your buisness look
    retro and playful. Where is the design aspect of your business represented in
    this logo?"
