		<div class="commentbody">Well seeing how this event is a debasement of mass consumption in which its only purpose is to further indulge our need for longing for things, opportunities, and lifestyles we cannot achieve, I am fairly sure you can buy it somewhere.  Frankly the wedding itself isn't what people are tuning in for, I think the majority of us don't really give a hoot about it.  Only reason why most people tune in is to see how the wealthy spend their money on ridiculous.  The best part is, British civilians will be picking up part of the price tag, apparently $33 million is a bit steep for the Windsor family.

Anyways, to the topic at hand, that is quite a lovely booklet they got.  I must agree with the "at" comment, it does a look exiled from the rest, maybe it's the village idiot of the group?</div>

People certainly have a fascination with wealth, but my guess is the main reason people (mainly women, according to one poll I saw) have a fascination with the royal wedding is the fantasy element. Royal weddings have been the subject of numerous myths, stories and movies. It's the fantasy of marrying a prince and having an amazing wedding and living happily every after.

Plus just the spectacle of it. People like a good show.</div>

Thanks. The Haymarket Media Group. I'm not familiar with them, but I Googled their name and found this press release announcing they were chosen to design the program:

Ironically half of the wedding is getting paid by taxpayers. Apparently even a $34 million wedding is steep for them. 

The best part about the whole invitation scheme is actually their rejection letters. (sorry for the large size)
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ivnvitation-card_3768.jpg]
This is one they sent to the President of Malawi.
However if you care to take a gander to the bottom right corner of the letter, you can clearly see that whoever designed this letter decided it was good enough just include a "not" and not make a proper rejection letter.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">From the image, it looks like they didn't <em>have</em> small caps, and thus the words "Official Programme" were instead set in two different sizes of normal capital letters.

And I don't think one needs to be "really picky" to find that unfortunate.

Placing "at" on a line by itself, so that the names of the bride and groom can be on one line, and the name of the place can be on another line, seems quite reasonable to me for a document of this nature - a title page, at least, can legitimately have something of the category of an invitation card.

What was the custom in olden times was that if Mary Jones married John Smith, she would still be addressed as "Mary" by her friends, but if she were addressed <em>formally</em>, she would be called "Mrs. John Smith", to indicate that she is the wife of John Smith - and, in fact, the form "Mrs. Mary Smith" would be improper, used only in the case of a divorced woman. (Referring to her less formally as "Mary Smith", however, was proper even then.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I know that when I use the phrase "really picky", I am referring to a concern over things that... it is not really necessary to be concerned about.

I think genuine small capitals are more in the category of things that one <em>ought</em> to be concerned about, even if many people are not these days, and so one could get away with cutting corners.

However, until such time as small capitals are supported in a standard manner by the operating system itself - as opposed to being supported only in more expensive applications programs - I think it is still legitimate to exclude them from basic font packages. The criterion which I see as applicable is not concerned with the <em>intrinsic</em> importance of small capitals, but the simple fact that only professional users would actually be able to make use of them <em>if provided</em>, and so given this... environmental... circumstance, it's legitimate to make them one more item only included in the "professional" version of the font with its professional pricing.

When, as, and if, Windows gets fixed so that small capitals are at least as easy to access as bold and italic from within <em>WordPad</em>, and any rich text control that might appear in an application or on a web page, <em>then</em> a regular font that doesn't come with small capitals would look silly. That day has not yet come.</div>
