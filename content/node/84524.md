  a Tech Writer/DTP guy and I am creating some new templates in InDesign. One of the
  items I notice is for my bold headings, fonts like MS Mincho (Japanese) and Sim
  Sun (Chinese) do not have a bold property. Word was very good at making this up
  as it went but InDesign, not so much. \r\n\r\nHere are my questions:\r\n1. Is there
  any Western Fonts that support bold? I see Chinese papers that have bold in them,
  they use MS Gothic, but it does not have all the characters that Sim Sun has for
  Chinese. \r\n\r\n2. Is it appropriate to bold western fonts? "

    I have difficulty in making sense of your questions.\r\n\r\nEach weight of a font
    is a separate font. Times Bold is a separate font from Times Roman. Many East
    Asian typefaces have two, four, or even eight different weights. However, these
    are mostly higher end typefaces sold for professional publishing, not so much
    with system fonts.\r\n\r\nKozuka Gothic and Kozuka Mincho are both Adobe Japanese
    fonts that come in a range of weights, some at least are probably bundled with
    your apps.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    will look into the Adobe fonts and see what they could do for us.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
