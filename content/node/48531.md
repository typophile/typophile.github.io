  body: Formal or casual? Antique or modern? As for formal, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/ihof/p22_imperial_script">P22
    Imperial Script</a> has a larger x-height which will help at small sizes, but
    may still be too thin. Have a look at these <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/bold-formal-scripts/">bold
    formal scripts</a> as well.
