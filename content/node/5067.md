  critism. The standard of type design here is incredible and makes me feel very humble.
  <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been working on a face for a couple of weeks, on and off.
  I wanted to produce a graffiti style display font. It started out as graffiti style
  handwriting which I scanned but  became more disciplined as problem and inconsistancies
  started to emerge. As I began to place the letters side by side, they didn&#39;t
  fit together, so the overall style gradually became more uniform. Any critisms are
  appreciated. <BR>&#60;br&#62; <BR>&#60;br&#62; <BR> <BR>&#60;img&#62;

  body: Hi, Frank! <BR> <BR>I suppose you are keeping the spacing tight to maintain
    the feeling that one is looking at graffiti, right? <BR> <BR>I like the curve
    of the &#34;Y&#34;...  <BR> <BR>And that&#39;s an interesting &#34;E&#34;! But
    I don&#39;t think I know enough to say whether you should keep it the way it is
    or modify it a bit... basically, you might want to open up the counter spaces
    just a wee bit. Same goes for the top of &#34;C&#34; and &#34;G&#34;... those
    parts will tend to &#34;clog up&#34; at smaller sizes... <BR> <BR>Anybody else
    have an opinion on this?

  body: This is very &#34;animalistic&#34; - I like it. <BR>Reminds me of some Excoffon
    stuff. <BR>It&#39;s crying out for a heavy dose of optional alternates. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Thanks for the comments guys. Ricardo, yes I wanted the look of graffiti for
    my typeface so I kept the spacing tight on the example, although I haven&#39;t
    properly grappled with spacing yet. I understand the &#39;E&#39; is different
    from the other letters in some ways, but I liked the aggressive look it had and
    decided to keep it. I will try and open up the counter spaces on the &#39;E&#39;,
    &#39;C&#39; and &#39;G&#39;. These were some of the toughest letters for me and
    I came up with many versions. <BR> <BR>Hrant, I looked up Excoffon as I wasn&#39;t
    familiar with his name, but I&#39;m certainly familiar with his work. I can see
    quite a few similarities with his &#39;Banco&#39; typeface, thanks.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not very clued up on the technical terms yet, by &#39;optional alternates&#39;,
    do you mean making for example 3 styles of the letter &#39;E&#39;? I might have
    this totally wrong, please bear with me. <BR> <BR>Cheers guys. <BR> <BR>Frank

  body: Hey Frank <BR> <BR>I just wanted to let you know that I really dig that E.
    It&#39;s real vibrant and alive - and gives the typeface...well a FACE! An identity
    if you like. Optional Alternates could be like those fonts that have alternates
    letters with ex shift &#43; letter or shift &#43; alt &#43; letter. I&#39;m not
    sure.... guys??? <BR> <BR>Cheers and keep up the good work <BR> <BR>Mark // Freelanceren

    <BR> <BR>Yup. Accessing them is a whole other ballgame though. Ideally you want
    an OpenType font that will choose alternates automatically while allowing custom
    user choices too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
