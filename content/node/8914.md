body: I&#39;ve got an opentype font that I have been trying to get to print, but it
  will not cooperate and print the correct glyphs.  <BR> <BR>I have the font set up
  to have alternates for each letter and they are named a.Alt, b.Alt, etc. I&#39;m
  using these alts as Stylistic Alternates. They show up correctly in illustrator
  and indesign but when I print the font out, it prints the original glyph &#40;with
  the alternate&#39;s letterspacing&#41; and not the alternate. My printer is a Brother
  HL-5140 laser. <BR> <BR>Any ideas?

  body: What happens when you &#39;print&#39; to a PDF? Does the font print fine on
    other printers? <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: It works when printing to PDF. Could the problem be that the  brother is not
    a postscript printer? I would hope not, because then my font will not work on
    half of my potential customers printers...

  body: My guess is that the font is OK but the printer driver for your Brother brother
    is not very well programmed &#40;by the Brother brother brothers.&#41;  <BR> <BR>I
    wonder -- do you have PUA Unicode indexes assigned to your altnerate glyphs? If
    not, does the problem persists if you assign PUA indexes to the alternate glyphs?  <BR>

  body: It&#39;s a PostScript &#34;clone.&#34; Still, one would expect it to work.
    Like Si, I&#39;d be curious to hear whether or not it works when printing directly
    &#40;not PDF&#41; to another device. <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Adam, that was the problem. I added unicode #&#39;s from E001-E069 and the
    letters printed. Thanks!'

  body: Although that may provide a useful workaround, it is not a requirement of
    OpenType that all glyphs be encoded. However, as Adobe has the &#40;possibly bad&#41;
    habit of encoding all glyphs, which is enforced by our tools, it may be that insufficient
    testing has been done of fonts that work differently. <BR> <BR>Do you still have
    a copy of the misbehaving version of the font, and if so would you be willing
    to share it with us for testing purposes? I want to be sure that our apps or core
    tech components within them are not making some bad assumptions.... <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T
