    really don&#39;t mind the extended apex, but it probably would work better within
    the context of the other characters if the treatment were used in other glyph
    - like the cap M for instance. Changing the angle of the inner slopes of the M
    to match an inverted A shape might help bring the detail together. <BR> <BR>Nice
    start.'

  body: 'hmm, Mr Bluett I presume?  ; &#41; Welcome my friend, <BR>your participation
    is long overdue!  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not convinced about the squared &#34;D&#34;,
    it is a little  <BR>too symmetrical along the horizontal axis for my taste. <BR>The
    crossbar of your &#34;H&#34; is too high, and I would open <BR>up the bowl of
    the &#34;P&#34; for I find it too square and too <BR>small as it stands. Have
    you tried playing with the  <BR>serifs, because they all look cut and pasted,
    a spot <BR>of variation wouldn&#39;t go amiss my good man.  <BR> <BR>What did
    you think of the vega party? pretty good huh! <BR>sigh. no longer a student, just
    an unemployed designer!  '

  body: Mmmm, that&#39;s getting very nice. The subtle cupping is a great detail.
    And the swooping R is lovely. Looks like you&#39;ve managed to solve the weight
    distribution issues and the join in the M as well. <BR> <BR>Show us more please!

  body: Ashton. I&#39;ll agree with Grant, I love how much more dressed-up it is.
    More &#34;painted lady&#34; and less &#34;ghost town&#34;. Your &#39;M&#39; is
    much better. Could the serif coming out of the &#39;G&#39; &#40;top&#41; be a
    little more convex, alluding to the larger convex shapes you now have? I also
    like the &#39;R&#39;, but would hope for an alternate version that isn&#39;t quite
    as swashy. And the sharp points might be better to have the a tiny flats. NIce!!
