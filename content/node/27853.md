  previous posts.\r\nI'm in the middle of redesigning my business card. So if you
  could take a look at its different \"color\" versions, and let me know what you
  think I would appreciate it a lot. They're going to be offset printed on translucent
  Cromatico\u2122 paper. The \"DESIGN CARE\" font is a Trade Gothic Condensed and
  my eMail address is a Kursivschrift Stehend. I was also thinking to use the \"@\"
  of the Digital Kauno font, which is pretty cool and \"exotic\" I would say...\r\nI
  usually use (nice...) Trade Gothic Condensed + Minion regular and italic in all
  my stationery documents but thought it was time for a little change...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/colorversions_5452.jpg]"

  body: "Ok this post has been read (at least) 38 times! C'mon guys!\u2026 Does it
    look that bad?\r\nI have also another version that includes my telephone number,
    written in CrashNumberingS\xE9rif (does anyone know this font?). Thought not to
    put my telephone number on it at the begining, and rather write it down, to create
    a \"closer\" relationship with the (future) client... But now I'm thinking : \"nah,
    drop this weird idea, this is not a date!\"\r\n"

  body: Your images aren't attached, that's probably why nobody has commented. Are
    you saving your files as rgb .jpg's? I think there is some info on how to attach
    files somewhere here on the site.

  body: Personally, I would put all necessary contact info (name, phone, address,
    e-mail, website) on the card, and not write it down. That is not standard procedure,
    and may seem strange to someone. I think I like the middle one with the reversed
    out type. What about doing the background as a duotone and not just gray? The
    image seems a bit flat to me. I think the type is fine, you're obviously going
    with a fun look. Although I must admit "design care" is not a term I'm familiar
    with.

    type of business card with very few text allows me to strike the attention on
    the different elements of the design. I know it a pretty strong statment make

    body: "The legibility of the email's typeface is of concern, specially if that
      is the only contact information on your card. I think usability has been sacrificed
      in the pursuit of style. The knockout version on the small point size, specifically
      on the \"v\" and \"ini\", makes it a difficult read.\r\n"

  body: "<strong>OOPS, I just noticed your other threads to have newer versions of
    your card. So just ignore my comments!</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nDrduckling, I think
    you might want to listen to all the things people have said, and do something
    with it. Instead of contradicting everything with the reason why you did something.
    :) Thats the whole idea of posting something for feedback...\r\n\r\nI think only
    putting an e-mail adress/website on a businesscard is a bit odd. You are actually
    limiting your potential clients on ways to contact you. What if a potential client
    wants to contact you from somewhere other then home or work? (i.e. somewhere with
    a internetconnection). They cannot call you by phone... and they might just not
    bother at all. \r\nWriting your phonenumber down when giving away your card, does
    not look too professional too. \r\n\r\n"
