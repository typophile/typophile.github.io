body: "Hey guys- need a little update on what is going on in New Orleans? Check out
  a local zine I started here in New Orleans. It's called Provocative. It is based
  on the contributor's interpretations on the word Provocative. Our site is www.provocativezines.com.\r\nOur
  second issue is in the works and should be out just before Mardi Gras. I am working
  on revamping our website, so no bashing the site please. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zine1_5750.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zine2_3492.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zinenola_5409.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zine2_4842.1.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zine3_5296.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zine4_6291.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zine4_3917.5.jpg]"
