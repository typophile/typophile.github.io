  body: "I'm not sure which button at the bottom of the panel you mean.\r\n\r\nOn
    the mac, I have the add class button, trash can (didn't touch that) and the accept
    button.\r\n\r\nI was viewing only the Kerning Classes when I did click on \"Clean
    Up Classes\"\r\n\r\nWould that kill all my OT classes?"

    can cause classes to disappear."

    that frickin' button at the bottom of the classes panel that supposedly switches
    between lists of the different kinds of classes. \r\n\r\nEspecially on a mac.\r\n\r\nThat
    is one nasty bug!"
