body: I&#39;m looking for a font, but I haven&#39;t found a  <BR>proper image yet.
  It&#39;s very 50&#39;s-style, with <BR>a bottom line that strikes through every
  character <BR>and links them together. It is a bit italic, <BR>I think. the characters
  are pretty square with <BR>round edges. I think a car manufacturer used it <BR>in
  the fifties. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been looking for a name or a sample of this <BR>font
  for ages. Thanks in advance for any help.

    target="_blank"> Jason Vanderhill called Topspeed</a> for a band logo which is
    based on pininfarina&#39;s logo below. I guess this is what you are looking for.
