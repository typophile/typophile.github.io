  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everybody.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wondering how possible it is to pursue type design as a career. Or more accurately; is it possible to earn a decent enough wage through designing type? If so would this only be if you worked for one of the major type foundries or is it possible through setting up your own tiny type studio? I know this sounds mercenary to ask only of the money, but it is a necessary part of living and I have to consider it.</p>
<p>To be honest I haven&rsquo;t designed a typeface so I&rsquo;m not exactly actively pursuing this career path. I&rsquo;ve started a few designs but have ended up losing faith in their potential or seeing some major problem in my understanding of typeface construction. Hence I&rsquo;m also  considering an MA course in the subject if nothing nothing else.</p>
<p>I work in publishing and while I&rsquo;m very lucky to be in a job that is largely creative I feel that it isn&rsquo;t necessarily what I&rsquo;d REALLY like to be doing. I&rsquo;ve been hanging around here (Typophile) for a coupla years now and the subject of type design i think appeals ot me a lot.</p>
<p>Any information and experiences anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>GT</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You and me both.</p>
<p>I am pursuing a BFA in graphic design. A few weeks ago, I decided that type design is what I really want to do. I know that I have tons to learn, but I think I can do it.</p>
<p>Considering the money (and I have), my plan is do keep being a graphic designer, meanwhile I&rsquo;ll be drawing letterforms and compiling entire type faces, reading everything I can in all the free time I have, and soon I hope to start selling my typefaces to foundries and type-sellers. When things start looking good, I&rsquo;ll make the switch.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t talked to too many people about this plan, so I am also wondering how plausible this is. I guess the good news is that my wife doesn&rsquo;t seem to be worried .. haha!</p>
<p>I guess at the end of the day, do what you love.</p>
<p>Good luck

<p>Yes, it is possible, at least in my opinion. Everyone&rsquo;s path seems to be a bit different. But so far, I have no complaints. I also am a fan of MA courses, being on one myself, but I&rsquo;d only recommend it for the knowledge and experience in and of itself, not because one&rsquo;d hope that it would directly lead to a career or better career.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in London, and my funds are somewhat limited as far as travel is concerned so don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to get to the US anytime soon. Are there any type conventions in the UK? I vaguely remember one in Brighton?</p>
<p>@dan; I would definitely do an MA for the purposes of knowledge and experience, but I&rsquo;d hope that it would lead me into a slightly differing career. It would improve my design and understanding I&rsquo;m sure - I just worry that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to go back to magazine publishing.</p>
<p>My housemate&rsquo;s trying to be a rockstar, though they dress a bit too much like 15 year old emo kids and their band name sucks.</p>
<p>Oh, and what sort of experimental music would the Linotype Foundry People play? Some sort of jazz/funk/gabba fusion? Soul-noise-kiddiepop?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Little known fact – Linotype did have an in-house jazz band, and the reason Linotype adopted the “Home Of The Originals” tag line was because the band’s name was The Originals.</p>
<p>They met with limited commercial success because they refused to play covers, concentrating on original compositions.</p>
<p>This led to a dispute amongst the band members with a number breaking away to form The Cambridge Upstarts.</p>

<p>The Brighton conference last September was the annual ATypI conference, but that seems to come to the UK only once a decade. This year&rsquo;s ATypI conference will be in St. Petersburg (Russia) in September. There is a design conference in Birmingham in October, I think, and the St Bride Library in London just had their annual conference about two weeks ago.</p>
<p>As for MA programs, if you in the UK then you are very close to Reading. As a UK resident, you might also be eligible for all sorts of funding possibilities that might not apply as fully to other students.</p>

<p>So, yes it is possible, yes it is fun, and yes, it is difficult to do. But there is money to be made if you can do it.</p>
<p>I would also add that the majority of type designers working today are largely self-taught, but with the success of programs like Reading, that surely will change.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>JamesP,</p>
<p>My clients are designers and art directors. Rarely do I do any work that does not come from an AD or designer. In fact I can&rsquo;t remember ever doing a job like that.</p>
<p>They contact me to do the typographic/lettering component of their jobs.</p>
<p>This week I had a branding company asking for multiple versions of a logo for a product they were repositioning, along with a string of words they wanted to be rendered based on a piece of historical lettering associated with the brand (an upright connecting script). I created limited character set MM fonts in FL and offered them a cascade of weights to ponder.</p>
<p>I also revised some book jacket lettering that I originally delivered to the client (and art director) last week. I also reviewed a bunch of old PS fonts for a Magazine that wants to update the kerning throughout their typographic palette. (again, an art director client)</p>
<p>Last week, besides the jacket lettering I created a full-featured OT font from some old US Park Service photos I did that in 4 days, my record for Upper/lower/smallcaps/inferior/superior fonts with a few calts. Its a funky display design with some 30s overtones.</p>
<p>Between doing this, I&rsquo;ve been slugging away at a bold display italic of a large Scotch/Modern/Didot family with Optical sizes. I finished the roman and text italic months ago, but the display italic had to wait while I did client work.</p>
<p>The week before that I was doing a OpenType conversion  for a large collections of fonts associated with a California university, and just delivered the finals a few days ago.</p>
<p>It goes like that pretty much every week. Sometimes when it gets a bit slow I can focus more on my own font development, but I normally have to fit that font development in between my client work.</p>
<p>And then there are the font sales from the website, and the customer service I provide when people who buy our font licensing need their hand held, or if a organization needs a formal proposal to be written so they can order our fonts.</p>

<p>The other point fascinating to me, as a type consumer, is how the logistics of launching a one-person foundry have changed: one master format, OpenType, and one very useful clearinghouse for marketing and sales, MyFonts. If you have high-quality goods it seems it&rsquo;s never been easier to bring them to an international market. Good current example: Ludwig Übele and his two serif families, Marat and Mokka, each launched on MyFonts recently as well as on his own site. Ludwig is a Type/Media grad; in fact Marat was his grad project there a year ago.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This thread has been extremely useful to me, I too am considering a career in type design, but was having a hard time understanding what doing that full time would look like. JamesM, your insight was especially useful.</p>
<p>I´ve designed the lowercase of one font (while I was still in school), which I aim to finish by next June. I´ve also done a fair amount of custom lettering for logos, etc. I´ll hopefully be enrolling in the new Master´s of Typography/Type Design at the Universidad de Buenos Aires in 2011 (fingers crossed!).</p>
<p>So I guess my biggest question now is how to get started as a professional typographer/type designer. I would imagine it would be similar to self-promotion as a graphic designer, but it seems that you work with a much smaller niche of people, as it is such a specialized field. I understand that going to conferences and just networking in general can be a great way to start, but there´s got to more to it than that.</p>
<p>Any insight?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

Other than what you already said, starting type design is just that, starting. Make type long enough to get to know it as an ingrained, comfortable  process and produce some work. You will grow by leaps with every new face produced.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">GT, Cassandra, everyone. Firstly I question the 1,000 figure. Maybe 100 is close. I agree with Dezcom, work on type design a lot. Find what you like and do it and re-do it. I have been very fortunate in choosing to re-create type rather than strictly design it but then I always think of re-creation as legitimate as so many others have done it including Adobe, Bitstream, etc. Work from the original, re-create it, like Adobe Garamond for example, digitize it, and you have something essentially new. I have designed original fonts but have never been happy with them, although I have sold a few. I would certainly look at the school at the Hague as well as Reading. Read as much as you can, look at every type book you can, read, read and read some more. I have worked with and continue to use Fontographer, Type Tool, and FontLab Studio. I think I agree with Phinney, very few designers are making a median living, i.e., 60k. For me, type design or re-creation puts a loaf of bread on the table, not much more. But I love it. So do what you love. And yes, a plug from me for myfonts.</div>

<p>It of course depends on the definition of what it is to make a living as a type designer, but consider who you may be leaving out. The world of type design is quite a bit bigger than what you may be able to sense through venues like Typophile or MyFonts. Custom type design is a world in itself that you don&rsquo;t hear often about.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget other scripts. I don&rsquo;t have the numbers at hand, but as I recall there were around twenty type foundries in South Korea a few years ago. And you can bet that not all of them are single-designer outfits; these type foundries typically employ several people holding the title of type designers. The big three foundries employ huge teams of type designers to churn out fonts. Admittedly, the necessity of big teams is a feature unusually pronounced CJK type design, but that still means that the number of CJK type designers alone could easily be on the order of 100.</p>
