body: Help. <BR> <BR>Its late, I&#39;m working on an unfamiliar machine, with some
  software I&#39;m not too experienced with and I&#39;m going round in circles. <BR>
  <BR>I need to do a data merge, and Adobe&#39;s website tells me I need the PageMaker
  Plug-In Pack, and that it ships with Adobe CS. I&#39;m sitting here with the CS
  pack and I must be going blind as well as mad because I can&#39;t find the PageMaker
  Plug-In Pack anywhere. <BR> <BR>InD is already installed, but there&#39;s no Data
  merge item on the Window menu. <BR> <BR>Any ideas?

  body: Oh, Ok, never mind. <BR>It seems that this copy of CS was bought too soon.
    <BR>Now its $49 to get the pack that shipped free with later versions. And a long
    download too. <BR> <BR>I think it will be quicker to put the data on a usb stick,
    drive home and re-do it all in Corel.
