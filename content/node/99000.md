body: "I'm looking for the fonts used in this card, (especially the ampersand \"&\"
  and the word \"The\".\r\n\r\nI want to make a wedding invitation as well, with a
  similar feel. \r\nIt 's a little retro, but not tooo much. It's romantic but not
  tacky and minimalist but not too artsy. \r\n\r\nSo I really like this, though I
  do not want to copy it... I just like the way it feels, \r\nThe names of the fonts
  would be great.. but if you have any idea's on how I could obtain a similar look,
  that would be great ! \r\n\r\nThanks a bunch !\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hd_4514b112cfb09cec5e2b85db99021452_4625.jpg]"

      bit more elegant though, I've got a crappy pic, but you'll see there's more
      space in the middle curl \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/&_6738.jpg]"
