    logotype. I'll email Font Bureau now and let you guys know how it turns out. In
    the mean time if anybody knows a usage off the top of their head I'd really appreciate
    it. \r\n\r\nThanks again! "

  body: "Correction: It was used as <em>the basis</em> of the current Fortune logotype.
    As explained in <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/blog/change-of-fortune/\">this
    blog post</a>, Highsmith modified his Ibis starting point a fair bit. So, that\u2019s
    not a pure example.\r\n\r\nHighsmith has written a short book on type fundamentals,
    due out this summer, the text of which we set in Ibis Text, but that probably
    won\u2019t help you in time for your class project."

    recently used Ibis Text as the secondary typeface in the branding of a little
    actuarial consulting outfit here in Switzerland (<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/6755021369/in/set-72157620488846151\">photo</a>),
    together with Breuer Text \u2013 one of my favorite new-found pairings."

  body: IMAO, Ibis looks so hot on these cards, @nina, that were you to show this
    image about, FB would fersure find themselves swamped with orders for it.
