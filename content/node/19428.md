  After investigating a little bit I found that the font is \"Ehrhardt Volume Expert\".
  I went to several internet search machines but this typeset is commercial and, therefore,
  you have to pay for it.\r\n\r\nDo you know any way to get this typeset for free?\r\n\r\nolea\r\n"

    from Linotype?\r\nFor use in a report, if you use a larger size for headlines
    instead of a bold (no need for a bold in a serious document), you get away with
    only two styles: Regular and Italic. Say, for use on Win or OSX you choose the
    TTF version -- only about Euro 50 total. I bet you will write more reports in
    future, and have some written correspondence too. How many DVDs or CDs do you
    buy each month?&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\r\n\r\nKarsten"

    but I note it is no longer offered as such. (?) What happened there?
