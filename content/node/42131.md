  onum {\r\n  sub @lf by @onum ;\r\n} onum;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n'lf' is the class that
  contains the lining figures and 'onum' the oldstyle figures.\r\n\r\nWhat I reallt
  wanted is to have Tabular and Proportional Lining figures and Tabular and Proportional
  Oldstyle figures. \r\n\r\nHow would I go about doing this ?\r\n\r\n\r\nRr "

  body: "Miguel, why does your code use two terms, \"fit\" and \"proportional\", for
    what is the same figure characteristic?\r\nYou only have one term for \"tab\"
    (although you could also have used \"monowidth :-)\r\nWhy not replace the term
    \"fit\" by \"prop\" to get consistency between class names and feature code?"

  body: "It is a little off topic, but one thing you may wish to consider is to have
    the same setwidth for both the lining and oldstyle tabular figures. Many fonts
    don't. I suppose there is no real problem if you don't, but for those of us who
    make use of the \"figure space\" (U+ 200[something]), it is a help.\r\n\r\nIt
    is important that the roman and italic tabular figures have the same setwidth
    -- both roman and italic figures can occur in a table. I've seen (& fixed) fonts
    where the roman & italic tabular figures had a different width; of course, they
    don't line up. Bold is less common in tables, but does happen. \r\n\r\nYou can
    also have a different design for the tabular oldstyle figures, to help fill/fit
    the common body. One example would be Carter's tabular oldstyle figures for Galliard.

  body: Nick, those denominations are what we use in-house, which were defined a long
    time ago. You can use whichever names you prefer.

    slighly confusing, but simply changed them to one I found more understandable

    character. I can't remember where I heard it but I'm sure I was told that using
    the underscore within the opentype code could cause problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nliningtab

    ligature conjunction, while an underscore after the dot can be freely used. In
    class names, underscore can be freely used though in FontLab Studio, class names
    that start with an underscore indicate a kerning class. \r\n\r\nA."
