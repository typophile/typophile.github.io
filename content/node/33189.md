body: "I recently designed a business proposal for a company as part of some freelance.
  They gave me all of the copy to use, but they customize their proposals to tailor
  to the specific client, so they need to be edited for each new proposal. The problem
  is, I designed the proposals in InDesign, and the company wants to be able to edit
  the proposals on their own (when they're on the road, etc.). \r\n\r\nThey don't
  own a license of InDesign, and buying copies for each person would probably be overkill
  since all they would use it for would be to edit these proposals. They want me to
  migrate my design to Word so they can edit it, but I don't have much experience
  with Word templates, and I feel it would be a lot of work with the way the spreads
  are laid out.\r\n\r\nIs there a better option for converting an InDesign document
  design to something that common, everyday users can edit?"

  body: you could convert the design to Acrobat PDF and  make the text editable in
    Acrobat Pro. I don't know how to do it myself, but check on Adobe's site

    and save it that way for you - then your client can read  it in Word...

  body: "You can make editable text fields in Acrobat Professional that they can use
    to insert their own information using embedded fonts. I've worked on such a project
    where a B2B client inserts their own phone number at the bottom of a PDF using
    an editable text field.\r\n\r\nIt appears in this menu: Tools/Advanced Editing/Text
    Field Tool."

  body: While my initial instinct would be to suggest Acrobat Pro as well, it's not
    cheap either.  I've set up a few templates in Word to be filled in by clients
    -- if you set them up using fixed-height table cells, you can actually do some
    pretty good work with them.

    InDesign document with Freight Sans Book, and although it said the right font
    in the Word formatting palette, it still looked like TNR. I changed the font for
    the text and now it looks the same. A very useful tip, thanks!   '

    in the Header and Footer will not be visible in Normal View. They will appear
    greyed in Print Layout View but will appear correctly in Print Preview.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want imported pictures to appear correctly while editing the document you
    could...\r\n\r\nInsert > Picture > From File > Then right click on the imported
    picture > Format Picture > Layout > Select 'Behind Text' > Advanced > Picture
    Position > Select Horizontal and Vertical 'Absolute Position' and specify distances
    to the right of and below 'Page'.\r\n\r\nThis should stop the picture moving around
    with the text, but it does mean the user could move or resize it. Maybe there
    is a way it could be 'locked'?\r\n"

  body: Jon, thanks. I tried your suggestion above and it worked. It looks like the
    client would have to do a lot of fancy stuff in order to move these elements,
    so hopefully they will remain fixed in the doc.
