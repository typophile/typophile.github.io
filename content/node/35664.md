  play The Tempest so that it resembled a teapot; what software package would be best
  suited for messing about with such a mess of text and form?

    vector program. Then, import it into InDesign. From there I would use the text
    wrap feature.\r\n\r\ngood luck."

  body: As my madness slowly subsides, I realize that the hardest part is taking all
    the white space out of Shakespeare in order to flow nicely into my teapot. 17000
    words is a lot of text, especially when set metrically!

    doing this for my own sake, really. I like the idea though.\r\n\r\nRussell: Ha!
    I'd considered that, but I want it to look like a teapot, not a coffeepot."

    number of typewriters for an infinite amount of time will produce a Tempest in
    a Teapot?\r\n\r\nInteresting."

  body: Did I? Hmmm... I thought I used the entire play. If I left anything out, you
    can blame the Gutenberg Project... But as far as I know, there's no Scene 4 in
    act 2.
