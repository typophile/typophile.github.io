  body: "Maxim Zhukov has a nice term for the ascender of \u0431 (Cyrillic \"b\"):
    brush.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, this diagonal stroke of \"4\" doesn't have a specific name.
    Calling it an arm is a good idea, to distinguish it from diagonals which are connected
    at both ends."

  body: "Thanks guys :D\r\n\r\nIs it possible for it to be called a terminal?\r\n\r\nSo
    to describe the \"arm\" I would have to say - the rounded edge arm?\r\nHow do
    I describe the rounded \"arm\"?"

    really, how often do you get to use such a great word?\r\n\r\nI'd describe this
    as a narrowing diagonal stroke from a bulbous terminal."

    me as a good description (it's the word for a fox's tail).\r\nPerhaps I imagined
    it."

    for my college assignment. I asked my lecturer but he said he didn't know. He
    said it could be a terminal. :S"

    sound more eloquent."

    Practically speaking, type terminology is\r\nrelevant in the absence of visuals;
    you want\r\npeople to get what it looks like with words only.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
