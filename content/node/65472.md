body: Hi all. I would appreciate your opinions on this typeface under construction.
  I want to create a monoline slab serif with a "DIN" feel to it, and to also be readable
  at text sizes. I have only given the letter spacing a cursory adjusting, so go easy
  there. But in the end I do see this having generous "air" between everything. Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slab_specimen_01_6584.gif]

  body: I like it. I like all the tapered ends. The daggers, if you're ready to care
    about things like daggers, could use some of those. The top serif of the "d" is
    distracting and would probably be better turned back the other way. I think the
    bottom a-join of "ae" should  not thin as much as in the regular "a", because
    there's no stem there.

  body: "I too like the tapered serifs. They give a certain warmth to the characters
    that I really enjoy. And I also agree with cerulean in that the bottom a-join
    of \xE6 looks a bit too thin. Your hyphens jump out at me really quick, too. I
    think they are too thick, by about 20 or 25%.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is more work
    to be done with the acute accent (\xB4). I find it a bit too slanted and squished
    down. I think pulling back on the angle a bit and giving it just a bit of height
    will greatly improve them. Right now, it feels as though the acute accent has
    really nothing to relate to in the rest of the typeface design, and I think the
    angle makes it look somewhat thinner than other strokes in the design.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    and this is probably a question of personal taste: I\u2019d love to see an apostrophe
    with some curvature. It may help consolidate the overall warmth that I mentioned
    at the beginning. Or maybe not, but I\u2019d try it anyway.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    sharing!"

  body: "Thanks. Good calls on the \"\xE6\" and \"d.\" Didn't even see that. Your
    accent comments got me thinking about punctuation and diacritics altogether. I
    made some adjustments to get them more \"in line\" with the warmth that you pointed
    out. (rounding and tapering...new ones in black) Those extras are so open to interpretation,
    yet at the same time bound by some strict guidelines. It's a great challenge.\r\n\r\nDo
    you think the comma/semicolon should be curved like the quote marks?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slab_specimen_02_4176.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slab_specimen_03_4549.gif]"

  body: "So I've been hard at work on this, expanding it into a small family. (now
    \"Frusta\") Just when I think I'm about done, there are some details that I feel
    could improve. Could I get your opinion on the terminal changes in the S,c,e,
    and s below? I can't objectively tell if this would be an improvement or not.
    I feel like it would make the characters more open and steady on the baseline.
    What do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/frusta01_5347.gif]"

  body: You could also try a mix, for example using the "current" treatment for the
    bottom of /c/ and /e/ and "proposed" for the rest...
