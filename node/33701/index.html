  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m making a website for our landscape photography.  I would like to have help in polishing the site, perfecting it.  The site linked to is only a dummy site.  None of the navigation works as it will on the final site.  Just click on the left side of the page and that will take you to the next page. I have the cover page, the table of contents and one gallery page posted.</p>
<p>It is meant to look like a magazine or photographic journal.  The descriptive text will change so don&rsquo;t worry about how that looks as far as kerning goes but I would like to know how you like the overall layout. On the gallery pages there will be a remote rollover thumbnail off the page numbers to navigate by.</p>
<p>I never could decide which weight of Titling Gothic would work in this layout so I just used Alternate Gothic No. 2 which I already owned.</p>
<p>Please critique any element of the design and type.  I would like to hear what you think about the logo also.  The font used for the symbol is very apropos for Nantucket as we have the largest deer population per square mile in the state.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sharon, at first glance, I know you said this was a place holder, but it&rsquo;s not in the best practice whatsoever to paste large images and then image map them out for various links, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s early so Ill throw some stuff in your direction. . .</p>
<p>Not sure about the &ldquo;volume 1 first issue&rdquo; perhaps you can incorporate it elsewhere without that unsightly white box. Perhaps you can centre the whole page, and drop the white box and text (therefore no white box) into the white area. Lot&rsquo;s of empty space that shows off the photograph which to me is both good and bad. The navigation page is pretty. . . but sort of lacking direction and ease of use&hellip;Again I know it&rsquo;s not final, but I dont really know where Im going or what Im clicking on. '</p>
<p>Why so we want to make it look like a magazine? The web and print are two different beasts, and crossovers can happen, but for example all those numbers, page numbers, thats decoration,  not function, and if anything it might lead people astray.</p>
<p>The page LOOKS great, very well laid out, but its ease of navigation, coding, etc. are iffy. The typography looks nice, but guess what, the web and typography are also a different beast. Fonts are limited unless you build a flash driven site. The layout you have created could work for a complex table based site (although I prefer CSS)</p>
<p>The centered text on far right, news and shows. . . ick, everything else is fl/rr.</p>
<p>So yea I like it, its pretty. But for a real website thats coded instead of a simple jpeg image, it will rather different. The typography for starters. Look forward to seeing the final.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks James and Darrel.  I actually find your comments encouraging as they confirm some of the areas I&rsquo;ve had misgivings about.  I realize that not having the real navigation in place was probably a mistake in putting this up for critique.  I&rsquo;m encouraged that you find it attractive.  It will be flash driven, but I&rsquo;m not doing the flashing so I can&rsquo;t post examples.</p>
<p>James, I agree with the news/show area&hellip;ick is right! I&rsquo;ll fix the white box.</p>
<p>Thanks for the critiques.  I really appreciate them.</p>

It&rsquo;s a nice layout and that&rsquo;s all.
this is a photography website and a great place is given to it.</p>
<p>This website is not for a bank or institutional service.
Of course, the layout is not usual. but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a problem&hellip;</p>
<p>BTW, I really like the type treatment on the homepage.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Heads up on the Flash. You might get some backlash. The photographers I&rsquo;ve worked with seem very gullible/interested in google search engine rankings. One of the most popular photoportfolio sites, LiveBooks is pure Flash and I guess they&rsquo;re getting a lot of heat from their users because google isn&rsquo;t picking up any of the content off their all-flash sites.</p>
<p>The other issue that I think is an issue for any photographer looking for contract work is that flash sites are quite often not bookmarkable. It can be nice to be able to bookmark specific images to pass around to internal designers/art directors who might be considering the person&rsquo;s work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Darrel, I&rsquo;m planning on using this as a marketing tool to designers, gallery owners and art patrons. I don&rsquo;t see web based photography sites as being all that great a way to sell your photos. Photography looks a lot different on a monitor than it does printed. Some of my best work looks pretty crappy when reduced to 486 pixels width.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sending out direct mailers to the above mentioned people inviting them to view my online gallery. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m using the magazine layout. I want to express a point of view and a connection with what I feel is important about Nantucket.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought about the bookmarking. That&rsquo;s a good point and I&rsquo;ll have to think about how I can address it.  Maybe a section of downloadable small jpegs.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your ideas and wisdom. I appreciate it greatly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi</p>
<p>Why not make a hybrid site instead. Have some of your elements as Flash, maybe the nav, with alternative html nav for users with JavaScript turned off. And the main layout and structure in HTML. You could always get Mono Slide Show Flash gallery to use for the photography. Then you would be more assured of having google etc spider it properly.</p>

<p>Yay! ;o)</p>
<p>Site looks nice. It&rsquo;s hard to read a lot of the type (it&rsquo;s awfully small and, as it&rsquo;s an image, I can&rsquo;t resize it) but, then again, it&rsquo;s the photos that matter so it&rsquo;s probably not a huge deal. I like how you ID the photo on the little map on each page. Nice touch.</p>
<p>Nice photos, btw!</p>
