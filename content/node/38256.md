  body: I'll bring this thread to the attention of my partner, Ross Mills, who has
    a lot of experience working with native American languages, but I believe the
    editor is almost certainly correct. The below macron is a fairly typical mark
    in the orthographies of many languages.

  body: "Thanks, John.\r\n\r\nI actually agree it should be a macron below, except
    for the small problem that some Comanche's apparently don't agree. In the past,
    I have found myself arguing with the Navajo that their early rendition using a
    \"reversed cedilla\" was wrong for the nasalized vowels, and with the Cherokee
    that Plantagenet Cherokee served them better than the official Cherokee, when
    mixed with a particular Latin font. \r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, neither of these
    is a comfortable place for a Norwegian-American to find himself. "

  body: "Well, you could argue for either. Typographically, you may want to use the
    macron beneath an 'i' or an 'I' and the low line beneath wider glyphs. Semantically
    (in terms of text encoding), one or the other should be used. So, what is the
    expected form? Generally, I would say it is the wider, or underline, form. The
    combining lowline is encoded as the combining form of the underscore, and theoretically
    should join on the left- and right-hand sides if in sequence (which, by logical
    extension would mean that the combining low line needs to be a bit wider then
    any glyph it is to sit under). One could say then it is not a diacritic, but that
    would be wrong, because it has effectively been used as such. The orthographies
    of Comanche or Pawnee use(d) an underscore to mark short or voiceless vowels and
    a barred u for a rounded high central vowel.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the underline width
    should optically match the glyph it is sitting under in terms of width. In producing
    fonts, I am mapping both combining marks to pre-composed glyphs for composition/decomposition
    because these are fairly ambiguous marks and if someone is making a keyboard that
    uses them, they may use either 0331 or 0332 (there is no codepoint for the pre-composed
    glyphs for the bar/line below characters although there is for the barred-u).
    In reality, such niceties have not seen much use due to technological barriers;
    rather the characters are represented most often as underlined and struck-though
    in case of the barred-u.\r\n\r\nThere is much in some of the more isolated languages
    and orthographies that can be viewed as typographic aberration. This has to be
    tempered with users' expectations and is an interesting subject. Were the Navajo
    you mention actually using a backward cedilla instead of the proper ogonek? It
    wouldn't surprise me, as many fonts come with a cedilla, but not so many with
    an ogonek (or a+ogonek with acute, or epsilon with ogonek etc. etc.). Native languages
    may possess an orthography, but haven't been graced with typographic sensibilities\u2014either
    in available typefaces or in the production of documents in terms of necessary
    technological requirements for handling such orthographies. This can lead to a
    degradation of quality of the typographic presentation of these languages, which
    in turn becomes the norm, which in turn may become a user expectation. Sometimes
    this takes the form of the perceived value in that which is degraded, or mutilated.\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't classify the use of an underline as such an typographic aberration (I'm
    not willing to argue the linguistic side, as I'm not a linguist) but rather the
    sort of adaptation that goes on all the time in establishing orthographies.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Ross\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Ross, I will pass this thread on to the editor.\r\n\r\nAs a typesetter,
    I don't face the problems a font designer does. However the MS comes in, we'll
    change the character to uniXXXX0332, and I will make up precomposed glyphs for
    the print edition. Following your suggestion, I suppose the underline should be
    optically the same width as the character, with a contextual alternate feature
    for successive underlined vowels, so in those cases, the underlines would overlap.
    I'll take a look at the MS & see just how many of those we encounter.\r\n\r\nIn
    passing --\r\n\r\nThe Navajo with the reversed cedilla was a font prepared by
    the Navajo Schools, available for a while (long ago) on the SIL site. As I remember,
    it was one of the Times Romans, and an ogonek was available in Times. I believe
    that font has now been withdrawn, or replaced with one using the ogonek.\r\n\r\nAs
    I'm sure you know, there can be competing orthographies. Ella Deloria's rendering
    of Lakota is quite different than the Buchtel (sp) system -- and far harder to
    typeset, though probably easier to mark with a pencil. And while many orthographies
    use the raised comma (aka \"apostrophe\", \"single close quote\", \"quoteright\")
    to signal a glottal stop, Polynesian uses a turned comma (aka \"single open quote\",
    \"quoteleft\") for that purpose. At some significant level, what is right is a
    matter of convention, not a pre-established system.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nCharles"
