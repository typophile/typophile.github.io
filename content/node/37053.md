    best I could find for you is the binaries above (you don't need to compile from
    the sources!). It seems no one cared to build a package that makes the intallation
    for you, else that would be on Peter Selinger's page, I guess. "

    phobia of mine, getting into Terminal and ending up with a doorstop that used
    to be a computer.
