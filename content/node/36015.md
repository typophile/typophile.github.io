  \ \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CoronaExtraLogo_4941.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  came up with something close to the C with plainblack wide font, but I really have
  a hard time looking through all my fonts without crashing my computer....I need
  a new one.  It looks like 2 seperate fonts...one for the capital C in Corona and
  for the lowercase.  Anyone know a font that is close to these?  \r\n\r\nI need to
  identify the lowercase, the C in Corona, and the E in extra.  \r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance for your help!  "

    You could try <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-goudy-text/>LTC
    Goudy Text</a> or <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/old-english-text/>Old
    English Text</a> to get decently close.

    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fette-fraktur/\">Fette Fraktur</a>
    seems pretty close. A simplified version of the caps of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-old-english/\">Engraver's
    Old English</a> might do for the initial letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    of blackletter with Mexican sign-painters]], with some interesting examples. A
    few I got in Ensenada are on page 2.
