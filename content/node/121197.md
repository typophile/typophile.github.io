  its serifs got chopped!\r\n\r\nthe handling of serifs in this font is \u2026special
  - YOUR expert eye might recognize the font immediately where\r\nwtf couldn't do
  the job; i tried identifonts \"tools\" as well (specialty capital_y has a lead)
  but it is not in its listing.\r\n\r\nsorry:  but haydn is just a 5 letter word!
  ;)\r\n\r\n(as a one off: has anyone ever seen a non-italic bodoni with such an open
  small_g? accent aigu perhaps interesting too)\r\n\r\nthanks !![img:sites/default/files/old-images/2222_5872.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3333_5085.JPG]"

    of Carolus is Karl-Erik Forsberg (http://www.linotype.com/710/karlerikforsberg.html)
    and that there was a digital version of the same name by Image Club, also published
    by Corel as Carleton."

  body: "excellent! that's of great help!\r\n\r\nsince dpape pointed to a digitised
    font which essentially has the same name as the original i guess its ok to award
    him the title :)\r\nspecial thanks to riccard0 (again) for very valuable info
    - dafonts version is a little oddly digitised?! - with your help i found a better
    suiting digitisation!\r\n\r\ni'll keep it open for a bit longer though because
    i'd like to see if there's some more coming up in regards of the 2nd font;\r\ni
    have read a thread on differences between bodoni and didot; dpape very cleverly
    came up with a didot - but although small_a has a didot-belly, small_t (both not
    pictured) has a bodoni-antenna and serifs are tapered bodoni-style\u2026"
