  body: "I sent the following message using the FDA's feedback form. We'll see if
    it gets anywhere:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Just thought I'd alert you to an error on
    your \"Examples of Revised Nutrition Facts Panel\" page. You rightly recommend
    Helvetica Black for the headline font, but the one used in your example is the
    poorly designed Arial Black. Here are examples of the two typefaces:</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>http://shurl.org/nutrition-facts-helvetica</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>http://shurl.org/nutrition-facts-arial</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I'm
    a professional typographer and I'm happy to typeset new example images for your
    page if you wish.</blockquote>"
