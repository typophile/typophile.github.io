    loops seem too small, especially on /g/\r\n/s/ (not the initial form) looks like
    it leans backwards - I suppose because it picks up on the angle of the stroke

    both.\r\n/ti/ in \"rationalization\" and /at/ in \"telepathic\" and /yr/ in \"polystyrene\"

  body: "Very nice for a first effort. Either you're very\r\ntalented, or you've had
    good teachers. Or both!\r\n\r\nHere's what I see for now (only in the alphanumerics):\r\n\r\n-
    You're nicely varying the lengths of the descenders. I would definitely do the
    same with all the ascenders.\r\n\r\n- Another variance I'm liking is the different
    leans, like how the \"f\" leans backwards. That's very nice, and there seems to
    be room for more of that.\r\n\r\n- \"d\": I might try to disconnect the bowl from
    the stem at the bottom.\r\n\r\n- \"el\": the discontinuity from the previous letter's
    join is jarring. Maybe you can just make its loop start from higher up (basically
    breaking the connection).\r\n\r\n- The shifting bar of the \"t\" is great. But
    it shouldn't skewer the tittles (dots of the \"i\"/\"j\"); I would raise the tittles
    [anyway].\r\n\r\n- \"x\": could work, but more contrast.\r\n\r\n- \"z\": maybe
    the middle loop has to go.\r\n\r\n- The numerals are out of character.\r\n\r\n-
    The asterisk: nice that it's not vertical, but I'm thinking you might try something
    fancier; maybe a form like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John%27s_Arms\r\n\r\nBTW,
    about the name: I think \"Retro\" is cool and fitting, but it's over-used. So
    you'd need to have a second word in the name (and I don't think \"Upright\" cuts
    it). Or you could choose something related, like the name of a famous TV housewife
    from the 50s. Lucy?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks so much for the feedback!\r\n\r\nCraig: \r\n\r\nOddly enough I'd never
    really related the shape of the cursive s as I'd learned to write it in elementary
    school with the shape of the printed s. They've always just been completely different
    shapes to me, the weight of the cursive one being entirely in the fat round part
    on the lower right. So to me it doesn't appear to lean at all. I guess the little
    loop at the top undermines that. I added the loop intending that it would suggest
    a sloppy, hastily drawn corner, not a tiny little underdeveloped top loop. It's
    good to know how other people interpret it, though, especially when they interpret
    it so differently than I do. I have a big round-topped alternative z which I've
    been meaning to substitute back in. Perhaps that one will look more balanced.
    \r\n\r\nWhat do you mean about lining-up issues? Are the connectors not lining
    up or..? \r\n\r\nThe vertical stems are one of my larger unresolved issues. Some
    of them I've left completely straight and flat, some of them taper a bit, the
    a is rounded off on the top, and of course some of them curve a little bit...still
    not sure how I'd like to unify it all.\r\n\r\n\r\nHrant:\r\n\r\nClearly both!
    :) \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean about the bowl and stem of the d. \r\n\r\nThe
    e is one of my least favorite of the letters. It always seems to stick out in
    an ugly way. I made some ligatures for s-e and b-e and some other combinations.
    I think they resolve some issues. They still need some finessing, though. \r\n\r\nI
    have some alternate t's that I used in \"title\" and \"situation\" which resolve
    the t-i problem adequately IMO. I forgot to substitute them into \"rationalization\"
    (they used to sub in automatically with opentype but I messed that up when I tried
    to make the beginning and ending swashes automatic too). \r\n\r\nIt took me such
    a long time to make that x work that well! I agree that it still needs some tweaking.
    It's been such a relief that it finally works as well as it does. \r\n\r\nI have
    some figures which relate better to the letters with bigger loops but they don't
    look as nice as these. Actually, quite a few of the older scripts I've come across
    have rather formal looking numbers. I was hoping that the teardrops on 2,3,5,6
    and 9 would relate to those on the c and the alternative s and r. The 2, 5 and
    7 have parts based on the F (one of 2 caps I'd started out with). Perhaps the
    contrast is different. They do seem to stick out a bit. \r\n\r\nAnd \"Retro Upright\"
    is just my working title. Haven't really put much thought into a real title but
    had to call it something, so...\r\n\r\nThanks again for the suggestions. Back
    to the drawing board I go!\r\n\r\nGilly"

  body: "<em>So to me it doesn\u2019t appear to lean at all. </em>\r\n\r\nI think
    of a cursive s rising to a point in the middle of the letter, not in the upper
    left. Here's a wikipedia graphic of cursive writing compared to your letters,
    with \"axes\" added. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rst_4227.gif]\r\nSurely
    Hrant is right that varation of lean adds to the liveliness of your font, so I
    wouldn't suggest parallel axes all the way through, but I think it'd be worth
    looking at straightening /s/'s lean a bit (if the incoming stroke angle can be
    accomodated somehow).\r\n\r\n<em>What do you mean about lining-up issues? Are
    the connectors not lining up or..?</em>\r\n\r\nYes, that's what I meant. This
    may be a function of how the pdf resolves the rendering\u2014I see now that it
    changes at different magnifications. (I don't know if that's good news or bad
    news...)"

  body: "Aha. I see. Yes, in that case the position of the s is a result of my connecting
    strategy. Originally I had a slightly more sloping connector, but it was actually
    harder to match up evenly (at least as far as on-screen rendering goes\u2014it
    jumped around even more when the resolution changed). I'd actually been considering
    switching all the connectors back to a slightly sloping position anyway. I'll
    see what I can work out...\r\n\r\nIn the meantime here's an earlier version with
    sloping connectors (probably the s still appears to lean quite a bit) and how
    I'd imagined the axes. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/rs_4610.png]"

  body: "Incidentally, I'm curious about the definition of \"cursive\" found in the
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39906?\">typowiki</a>.\r\n\r\n\"Being Cursive
    is a property of typography and Calligraphy which implies a certain inclination
    or angular tilt, either positive or negative, relative to the orthogonal \u201Cy\u201D
    axis.\"\r\n\r\nwhereas <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursive\">wikipedia</a>
    says (this is how I'd understood it):\r\n\r\n\"Cursive is any style of handwriting
    that is designed for writing notes and letters quickly by hand. In the Arabic,
    Latin, and Cyrillic writing systems, the letters in a word are connected, making
    a word one single complex stroke. In fact, the word comes from the Latin cursivus,
    meaning \"flowing\".\""

  body: "This is coming along nicely! I won't go into a very long critique, but will
    try to add a few tidbits.\r\n\r\nI really like the way downstrokes have that subtle
    taper at the tops. I would just advise carrying that feature throughout. That
    may have been mentioned above. I just noticed some as flat and some tapered. You
    might even consider this sort of taper for crossbars.\r\n\r\nI would try to see
    if you can strengthen the connections on the upstrokes of s and r. These are appearing
    perfectly vertical while the strokes that meet up with it taper into the point.
    This makes it look thinner on screen and weakens the connection. You might try
    having it slightly heavier at the top and overlap a bit deeper. I recently made
    an upright script myself and remember having to rework connections a few times.
    \     \r\n\r\nI agree with Hrant about the contrast of the x. It also appears
    to be leaning left. The lowercase x is probably the most difficult as it doesn't
    naturally want to play well with the rest. Once you get it closer to ready you
    might still want to add some ligatures to further control how it looks.\r\n\r\nI
    wish you the best with this as I think its going to be a wonderful and useful
    design.\r\n\r\nS"

  body: "Really nice! I love it!\r\n\r\nAnother trick is to use ligatures for those
    cases when the connections are really problematic. I'm developing a script font
    too, and don't wanted to fight with connections, so ended up with more than 70
    ligatures.\r\n\r\nI also added 'terminal' alternates, because at the end of each
    word you don't need to connect to nothing, so each glyph has an alternate version
    with a shorter tail.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can use the ligatures trick in your font.\r\nFeel
