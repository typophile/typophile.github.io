  type community and get a little assistance in figuring out the typefaces used for
  the following logo. I'm a newbie to Typophile and I do apologize if I'm doing anything
  incorrectly. I'm just a little stuck figuring out these typefaces.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your time,\r\n\r\nPete[img:sites/default/files/old-images/doylestown_attorneys_mcnamara_bolla_panzer_4253.jpg]"

    in the future: \r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/TypeID\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the names
    are set in ITC Giovanni (the ampersand is italic). \r\n\r\nThe tagline appears
    to be Frutiger to me."
