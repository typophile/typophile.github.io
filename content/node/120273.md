  body: "Given the date of the original and the manufacturing process, the original
    was most likely a custom die-punch typeface (they actually look like the sort
    of letters you'd draw with an architect's lettering guide). Here are a few contemporary
    digital fonts that may help you replicate the look:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/slim-james/

  body: "Good suggestions Bob and Kevin.\r\nAlmost looks like license plate letters
    in a jurisdiction where the need to squeeze in more than a few letters allows
    this width. But the _Q_ is a disaster. Too close to _O_ -- ignore the comma, _O_
    would look like _C_ with the gap closed.\r\nBTW looking at _J_, _M_, and  _W_
    leads me to believe that this is monospaced.\r\nDon"

  body: The key is the slight step back on the upper part of the B - that is why Neutraliser
    Sans will get you close.

    like the industrial machine look of it. Neutralizer and Stratum2 look pretty good
    to my eye. \r\n\r\nI like Don's comment about the Q being a disaster! \r\n\r\nI
    am going to hold off marking it as resolved just in case a few more suggestions
    come in.\r\n\r\nh.p."
