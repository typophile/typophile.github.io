  body: "Yup. History. At some point some antique encoding made them separate for
    some technical reason that's probably irrelevant now, and then Unicode tried to
    be compatible with all the (now antique) important existing encodings, and there
    you have it.\r\n\r\nSame reason the A with ring above alphabetic character and
    the Angstrom symbol are different characters.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
