body: "I bet this question has been asked a million times: basically, is there anything
  out there other than Times New Roman and Arial for the most common cross-platform
  fonts (for print)?\r\n\r\nI am designing templates for a non-profit governmental,
  political conference that needs a lowest-common-denominator font that can be found
  cross-platform. The templates will need to be accessible by all staff members who
  will all share in generating a body of documents within a one-week time frame from
  a home-office printer (like I said, non-profit...); they will hopefully come across
  with some semblance of a brand and consistent look. (The staff members are coming
  from all around the world, most will be using their own computers--who knows how
  old their PCs are). Every year, the conference has defaulted to Times New Roman
  and Verdana as the body and header fonts, respectively. \r\n\r\nAs I am not too
  familiar with the PC system, does anyone out there now if there is a common serif
  font with non-lining numbers (like Georgia, but for print?)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Verdana,
  I am similarly looking for a new sans serif font for the header type that is common
  to all/most pc's and macs. Arial and Verdana, so far, seem to be the only ones that
  don't need to be substituted when the documents are transferred from PC-Mac-PC.
  I used Franklin Gothic last year for table tents and name badges, signage that was
  generated on location, etc...but this year, the documents were sent back to me using
  Verdana once again (I think this is because when the PC users open a document with
  Franklin Gothic specified from my mac, it asks for you to choose a new, substitute
  font--so they just chose Verdana). Should I re-convert everything to Franklin Gothic?
  \r\n\r\nAs I will be working remotely this year from a different time zone, it will
  be hard to be the control freak who makes sure all documents are looking consistent
  before they are printed out \r\n\r\nThe logo that will be on all documents is attached
  (it uses Interstate, and the 'th' is Caslon 540 italic)."

  body: "...or, should I just throw in the towel and just make everything goof-proof
    in Times New Roman?\r\n\r\nI think I could force them to print in Franklin Gothic
    bold/book for signage by sending a bulk of documents in PDF form, but for last-minute
    things, there is huge potential for bad things to be pushed out of the printer
    (like long names being hyphenated and titles being cut off, etc.)"

    Ships installed on Windows Vista and Windows 7, and with Office 2007 and some
    other MS products. Non-lining numerals are the default style; lining and other
    numeral styles are accessibly via OpenType Layout features, as are smallcaps,
    superiors, etc.

  body: "Thanks for all your comments...client will probably like Georgia BECAUSE
    of the bold (for name badges and table tents): good for old eyes who aren't sitting
    in the front row ;) (But, as I will not be there to look over documents before
    they are sent to print, there is a very good chance that everything is going to
    get bolded, capped, italicized, underlined and enlarged, just to make sure you
    don't miss that point.)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of Cambria? Or is that not yet
    common enough on most windows systems? Was that only intro'd with Windows Vista?"

  body: 'Cambria doesn''t have old style figures as the default. I wouldn''t class
    it as cross-platform either, as Mac users have to pay for it (or buy Mac Office).
    Windows users would need Office 2010 to get at the old style figures. '
