body: "All what I can say:\r\n\r\nIts a lead type font.\r\nIt is NOT Sirius from Genzsch
  & Heyse, Schriftguss or J. John.\r\n\r\nIt might be Sirius from Berthold (1911),
  but I do not own a sample.\r\n\r\nIts a Grotesk bold condensed with only capitals,
  digits and... Punkturen (I don't know what it means in english, sorry).\r\n\r\nDoes
  someone know, if the Berthold Sirius is a Grotesk condensed type?\r\nOr does someone
  have a sample and can upload a quick scan, just to see it once?\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance,\r\n\r\nGeorg"

  body: "Hello Florian,\r\nwell - I own approx. 16 kg of it. Packed 1976 by Sellner,
    a dealer of used lead letter fonts. They were pros like I am. And if they wrote
    Sirius, there is a real chance, it is a font called Sirius.\r\n\r\nYes, I checked
    (my own) Seeman handbooks (and all others from the big foundries, I have). The
    only Sirius I could not find an example from was the Berthold one. So I tried
    to look for an posted print anywhere in the Internet, but I failed.\r\n\r\nIts
    no beautiful Grotesk. Its heavy, its old and with exception of a full character
    set I gave it back to lead (melted it again).\r\n\r\nBut you know: There are the
    types... so of course I have to know its name, understand? :)\r\nA lead font without
    name, roundry, year of first production AND artist, who designed it, is only some
    kilo of lead, nothing else. To identify an unknown lead font gives it back zu
    life...\r\n\r\nTomorrow I'll make some pictures of the character set and post
    it. May be someone has an idea. I thought, Mike Yanega might own an old Berthold
    font book and he'ld help...\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch
