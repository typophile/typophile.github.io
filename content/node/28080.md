  when I finally tried 'typography forum' and got right here. Typophile was not the
  first entry, but was the first I clicked though :)\r\n\r\nIt amazed me to see this
  thread in the forum and I realised that I am not the only one who does \"what font
  could this be..\" but instead, there are lots of like of me!\r\n\r\nOk, now to the
  point. Can you please help me to identify the font which is used on the attached
  image, or probably find the closest font which would also make my happy. This is
  from the Thomas Murray website<!--break-->, www.thomasmurray.com.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tmmenuc_4081.gif]\r\n\r\nFirefox
  got crushed a number of times when attaching the image, but the Flash upload tool
  worked like a charm."

    you mean. Cresci is out, because it doesn't have the U stem. How about <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=C.103161.0.1\">Cicero
    Caps</a>?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "If you look at the site in the link you'll see that (unless there's been
    manipulation) it's one of those fonts that has small caps instead of ulc which
    is why I initially went with Classic Light. Another font that has similarites
    is Michelangelo.\r\n\r\nAlso I don't think the A in the sample is a true point,
    it looks like it has a spur.\r\n\r\nI can't find that ampersand anywhere."

  body: "I'm stuck. I don't think the G on Classic Roman is right. The Zapf faces
    have an S that doesn't fit. I would like to go back to Shango, and say they modified
    the A, or maybe they mixed a few fonts here. If I look at the details of the enlarged
    tops of the T and M on the web site, they look more like Shango than the others,
    especially the M serifs.\r\n\r\nIn any case it's starting to seem like this is
    at least customized.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

      and with the small size and lack of aliasing, the inline just disappears. In
      Delphian, the U has a stem, the A has a spur, and the ampersand matches.

  body: "I don't think this is an inline font, but the idea of a customized solid
    version of Delphian might work. The Delphian letterforms are hard to tell apart
    from the site lettering, except for the T, which has more of a serif than Delphian.
    That wouldn't be too hard to add, though.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
