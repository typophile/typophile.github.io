  Verne's 20,000 leagues under the sea. This project spans over two quarters and an
  entire summer. So far I am a quarter into the project, our first class was book
  illustration. So as I'm knee deep in getting those illustrations finished before
  the summer is over I have starting thinking about the next step... Our next class
  is typography III which is where we will be typesetting our books, not to mention
  printing and case binding them by hand. (with a screen printed cover!) As I'm sure
  many of you know the book takes place all around the world in the 1860's. I've been
  thinking about the type for awhile but I thought that typophile would be a good
  place to ask for any suggestions. I'm looking for a very traditional and beautiful
  full serif typeface with nice ligatures. Maybe something that has a little bit of
  a modern flair to it. I might also be looking for a San serif that would work nicely
  with it. Even though im a starving student Ill find a way to get some money together
  to buy just the right typeface! So with all that out of the way any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nAaron"

    that you had in mind? How about Minion Pro? I think it's a timeless typeface :D,
    and it's look good with a lot san serif typeface too. Or go for Proforma if you
    want to spend some $$. It's very modern."

  body: "<em>not to mention printing and case binding them by hand.</em>\r\n\r\nDoes
    <em>by hand</em> refer to the printing as well as the binding? If you're going
    to print letterpress, will you print from metal type, or make photopolymer plates
    from type you set digitally? \r\n\r\nIf you're going to print from metal type,
    your choice will be limited to what they have in your college's print shop. If
    you're setting it digitally for photopolymer plates, allow for the fact that letterpress
    \"bites\" into the surface of the paper, so thin strokes will get a little heavier
    when you print them. \r\n\r\nThis effect is more pronounced on papers with a soft
    finish (sometimes called \"vellum\" or \"felt\"), and less pronounced on smooth-finish
    papers, so be sure to get your professor's advice on the best combination of typeface
    and paper stock.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see a preview of your illustrations if you're
    inclined to post some of them here. When you're choosing your type, [[http://typophile.com/node/58978|consider
    how it's going to work with your illustrations]] in terms of weight, contrast,
    and complexity (presence/absence of fussy details). \r\n\r\n<em>the book takes
    place all around the world in the 1860\u2019s. . . . Maybe something that has
    a little bit of a modern flair to it.</em>\r\n\r\nGo with your instinct re: <em>modern
    flair</em>. Verne wrote his stories in the 1800s,  but they remain popular because
    he set them in a kind of parallel universe. He wasn't constrained by the cultural
    context of his own century, and neither should you be."

    for one of the presses affiliated under the University Press of New England. It
    was designed by Rich Hendel.\r\n\r\nI don't remember what fonts Rich used; you
    could probably find a copy & get some ideas. That aside, my first thought is a
    good Scotch Roman. With Postscript fonts, I think that pretty much means Matthew
    Carter's Miller. Metal offers more choices, as, oddly enough, do older photocomp
    systems.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    playing around with the watercolor wash in front of the drawings. The book will
    be in two color (blue/black) and each chapter will start with an illustration
    such as this one. I should also mention that the book will be 8x8 with large margins
    and include little footer notes in italic blue type!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/14_Test_4673.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks

    first choice for a Nineteenth century serif would be Miller by Matthew Carter,
    a great contemporary interpretation of the Scotch types which works very nicely
    as a text face. And Font Boureau offers some sans to go with it.\r\n\r\nAn alternative
    to Miller could be Nick Shinn's ModernSuite Family (a Scotch Serif plus a Sans).\r\n\r\nI'd
    also have a look to Adrian Frutiger's Iridium."
