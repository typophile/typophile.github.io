    with Ruscha, I get this (Ruscha on top, computer bottom). \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/compare_4265.png]\r\n\r\nRuscha's
    thins are much thinner. Where can you find that font that gives the exact match?"

    body: "Hi Michel,\r\nI would suspect you cannot find a font that is exactly that
      thin (particularly since any original MICR font would not have been that thin).
      Likely a modification in Illustrator or Photoshop with some clear blocks will
      get one to the end result."
