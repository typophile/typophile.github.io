  to have a \"brand recognition\" moment - I usually tune out advertisements.  Obama's
  campaign signs use the same type and sensibility as his markedly well-done website.
  \ The branding of politicians is as old as politics itself, but this level of coherence
  between a campaign website and other marketing materials seems new. (Oh my goodness,
  [[http://jewsforobama.blogspot.com/2007/08/obama-08-yarmulkes-for-sale.html|Obama-kahs]]!)
  \ \r\n\r\nThis [[http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/004262.html|article
  & ensuing debate]] are all about Obama's site design, with a focus on type, and
  I want to hear Typophiles' thoughts on all this.  \r\n\r\nWhat do you think of Obama's
  site?  Of the use of type?  Do you think voters will respond to coherent design
  negatively as well as positively, feeling too advertised to?\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:
  I am letting my political nerdiness and design nerdiness intersect, but I'm not
  trying to proselytize for anything but good design."

  body: "I must admit I've not read the article now as I read it and a couple of others
    like it a few weeks ago. The whole branding debate is definitely interesting and
    Obama's is certainly the most well thought through of all of them. Whether people
    are turned on or off by this is a good question. I looked at all the candidates'
    sites a while back and Obama's communications are certainly more mature than the
    rest of them.\r\n\r\nAs an Englishman, looking over the pond &ndash; and hoping
    beyond all hope that American's can't do to the rest of the world what they did
    the last two times &ndash; it's interesting to note the use of two Gill typefaces,
    Perpetua and Gill Sans. I'm an ardent fan of Gill, who, born in my own home town,
    I find sums up a certain 'Englishness' despite his, erm, 'scandalous' family life.
    (Read on). Gill was a very political man, espousing a set of values based on a
    Catholic 'third way' called Distributism. I doubt any of the candidates, even
    Barack Obama, who I believe is dubbed an arch liberal in the States, will be ditching
    the markets and the trappings of capitalism too soon though.\r\n\r\nPerpetua is
    seen and spoken of less than Gill's Joanna, but it stands tall and elegant. A
    stonecutter's script. Gill Sans on the other hand is so ubiquitous I usually start
    yawning when I see it these days. Together they go quite well, despite not having
    been designed to do so. It works politically too: traditional Obama and modern
    Obama.\r\n\r\nI suppose one might take these literal comparisons too far. It depends
    whether the designer thought a bunch of type obsessives would retrospectively
    overanalyse things. Gill though is such a strong character, and so political that
    it's hard not to ask the questions. Amongst other things he was deeply religious
    (he converted to Catholicism), part of a movement that ran contrary to that of
    the times (arts & crafts rather than Modernism) and was sex obsessed, in practice
    (he bedded mostly every woman he came across including his daughters) and in his
    output work (you should see his naughty sculptures).\r\n\r\nDoes Obama or the
    rest of America care about this? Probably not. Interesting though, what a modern
    politician pins to himself isn't it?"

    was just over a year ago. We would have to say that the formal aspects of Obama''s
    logo now carry more meaning with our experience of the campaign as well as our
    increased familiarity with the politician. I may still take issue with some aspects
    of the logo''s construction (that babyish shade of blue still totally bugs) but
    over the last year the Obama marketing machine has been highly organized, deliberate
    and creative. Certainly more so than the other candidates. And now he is in a
    very good position. Nothing succeeds like success, and it''s hard to not see that
    when appraising the logo today. '

  body: Good point, The Don.  One thing I've found about logo design, is that the
    logo almost always changes somewhat, or at least the context around it changes,
    as the brand evolves.   Obama's brand has certainly evolved, and his logo is only
    a small part of his branding - those "change" campaign posters don't say "Obama"
    or have his logo on them, but they're set in Gotham and maintain the look of the
    website.

    to be successful.  The older I get the more I tend to judge things according to
    wether they work for their purpose and less for what i personally think. It certainly
    is a new direction which mirrors his message. It is however difficult to separate
    a candidate's logo from their message. If you don't like them you probably won't

    3 campaigns virtually unchanged. Does this mean it works since she's won twice
    with it or that she's too lazy to change it? I don't get consulted on such things."

    Change ad, his logotype, website.) Of course, politicians are the kings and queens

    on political campaigns, what considerations are important? Political branding
    seems mostly marked by blandness. (and of course the obligatory red white and
