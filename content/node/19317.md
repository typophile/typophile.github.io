  the 4\"x 6\" yellow booklet what was talked about, or did they run out of the regular

  so small I had to strain to see them. Things like this tend to make me feel old,
  and I don't need that! \r\n: )\r\nMaybe they should have a box you could check if

  hook up my magnifier lamp thingy and take a better look, maybe this weekend.\r\n"

    a previous life as a book artist. And the 10-years of P22 book is the most boundary-pushing
    type catalog since that po-mo wave (finally) ended. Yet in comparison to that
    stuff, the P22 book feels genuine and crafted. Much like their typefaces. If you
    don't like the catalog that they gave you for free, I suggest that you check out
    the real McCoy, which I believe is only $19.99 or so, and is worth every penny!"

    the prerequisite to setting everything up, and putting things in motion. \r\n\r\nit's
