  body: "This looks like a proprietary dot-matrix printer font, which means it's stored
    in the printer's ROM and it could be specially designed for a specific printer
    model. This make it rather improbable to find a modern vector font to exactly
    match your sample.\r\n\r\nYou can try though something similar as <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Berthold&ffam=Akzidenz-Grotesk%20Condensed%20BQ%20-%20Light&fstyle=&fsize=60&fid=b863d77d16d773f4a02f1fb75dcde3ac&wrap=2&text=27%2F081017%3A43|Akzidenz
