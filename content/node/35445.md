body: "Ok, I'm looking forward learning about the characteristics of the Adobe Myriad\xAE
  typeface, both looking at it as:\r\n\r\nI- A mutation in history of humanist typeface
  taking root in the work of Frutiger\r\nII-Taking part in a turning point in typography
  by the use of a new technology \r\n(Multiple Master)  \r\n\r\nMyriad don't seems
  to be THE typeface of a revolution like Heletica or Univers were (let's not make
  a topic out of this) more the crossing of multiples events, creating let's say,
  a both generic but unique typeface. \r\n\r\nWhat I know about the Myriad Typeface
  is that it was created mostly by Robert Slimbach and Carol Twombly, that it was
  first release in 1992 under the Adobe Originals familly  (in which the two designers
  have greatly contributed). I know also that it is a humanist sans serif font witch
  the fluidity reminded the human handscript. It's it organic structure that give
  the Myriad it's friendly look. Myriad as a humanist sans serif is based on the Adrian
  Frutiger eponymous font offert both a great lisibility in big and small scale as
  the Frutiger was created for signage purposes for the Charles de Gaulle Airport
  in France. \r\n\r\nOn the comparative image below, you can see a great similarity
  between the two typefaces. The first and second observation that I can do is that
  Myriad is a little bit more condensed that Frutiger and that some optical correction
  have been bringed to the letter legibility.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MyriadCompa_4182.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/A_3574.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/B_3795.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  know that even it is not the first typeface generated in the multiple master technology
  (minion was?), it as been part of the first number of typefaces who where.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBy
  structuring my research I thought that it should involve: \r\n\r\nI- A mutation
  in history of humanist typeface taking root in the work of Frutiger\r\nI-a) The
  evolution of humanists fonts\r\nI-b) The history of the Frutiger typeface\r\nI-c)
  A logical evolution from the work of Robert Slimbach and Carol Twombly\r\n\r\nII-
  A turning point in typography by the use of new technology  \r\nII-a) The Multiple-Master
  technology\r\nII-b) Turning point in typography\r\n\r\nWhat do you know about Myriad
  Typeface? do you know other aspect relevant to the typeface, or good books talking
  about it.\r\n\r\nWhich are the typeface or the topics, relevant to the study of
  Myriad?\r\n\r\nreferences:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/typedesign/slimbach.html\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/typedesign/twombly.html\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/opentype/T1_to_OTF_FAQ.htm\r\nhttp://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=328600&sliceId=1\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/28658?\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/adobe_originals.html\r\n"

    naturally the Myriad forms render on screen at small sizes (in Adobe\u2019s rasterizers),
    as opposed to Helvetica and similar grots that close up \u2013 largely unrelated

  body: "Hehe yes, just like I said earlier... 26.Jul.2007 7.56am\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the insight Simon, the \"screen font\" in relation with \"a great signage
    font\"seems interesting.\r\n\r\nAs for the purpose of my research, my post lack
    an introduction part. I am preparing myself for a workshop in which we will be
    asked to make an alphabet. Myriad was presented as a good exemple of typeface.
    The objective will be to build letters by starting with calligraphy, which brings
    us to the humanists type approach. In a sentence: I wish to know better about
    the \"method of construction\" of the Myriad typeface. That's why I'm interested
    in both the historical part (where does the form come from) and the technological
    part (what's this type try to achieve, by which means)\r\n\r\nI'm sure my spelling
    isn't helping giving credibility to my subject \"jpad\"(let's just not make it
    a topic out of it), I assure you, this is also an issue to me. I'm sure we could
    have a great conversation in French. I hope theses clarifications will help you
    posting other relevant comment on the topic.\r\n"

  body: I think I remember reading that Slimbach originally did the condensed, Twombly
    the regular, and then they switched and revised one another's work, the goal being
    to make is more impersonal, less idiosyncratic. Personally, I like the condensed
    better...

    like a weasel word.\r\n\r\nMany people out there would also see a great similarity
    between Times and Garamond because they both have these spiky things at the ends.\r\nOn
    the other hand, I assume most graphic designers could easily tell Frutiger and
    Myriad apart.\r\n\r\nYou should be more specific on that."

  body: "Matt, comment \xE7a va?\r\n\r\nI don't think your preparation has much direct
    relevance to your task.\r\nIf your alphabet will be a humanist sans, presumably
    you will be drawing it.\r\nI doubt that Robert Slimbach traced Frutiger or Today
    when he made Myriad and Cronos, although those designs obviously inform his --
    but he is an accomplished calligrapher and drafstman (Carol Twombly too.) \r\nYou
    don't have the skills to design a typeface/alphabet by closely reinterpreting
    another -- Frutiger's Avenir (from Futura) is another example.\r\nSo the only
    way you could get close to that kind of result would be tracing, which would be
    a bad idea, as, I believe, the whole point of the humanist approach is to work
    by hand and eye, rather than mechanically. (Man vs. Machine, rather than its original
    meaning, Man Vs. God.) It is the best way to avoid rote plagiarism, avoiding the
    trite veracity of the mechanical simulacrum.\r\n\r\nWhat you can do is to draw
    an original alphabet, without immediate reference to any other typeface, and then,
    when you have developed ideas on the kind of letter shapes and proportions your
    design will have, then and only then, refer to the font files of Myriad, Cronos,
    Auto, etc., to see how the glyphs have been refined with regards to parameters
    such as stem thickness, overshoot, sidebearing widths, terminal angles, etc.\r\n\r\nThe
    assumption is that you have absorbed and internalized enough typography to be
    able to \"work out\" (r\xE9alizer?) an original design, and squeezing it though
    your personal, hand-made process, will give it that originality and humanity.\r\n\r\nBit
    of a tangent: contestants in the Prix de Rome (French painting competition, late
    18th century) were sequestered in a villa for a month, where they were required
    to paint a work in the history genre, with no reference material! Now there's
    a concept for reality TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you Nick,\r\n\r\nWe often see comparaison when it's time to analyse
    a typeface (the eye's article -n\xB063- about Helvetica is one exemple). Do you
    say it's a wrong reflex? or is it wrong, only in the case of humanists fonts?
    If it is soo, is there a way of learning something about theses typefaces or does
    it have to be a pure act of self-expression?\r\n\r\nIn architecture and in design
    in general, a research field look at the process of design. In an architecture
    contest this means looking less at the final object and more at the sketches and
    the notes and what surrounded the project. Would it be relevant to look at theses
    sketches in the case of typefaces. For what I know (and I could be wrong)  there
    are no publication on the subject. \r\n\r\nI think your right about the preparation
    part, it's probably more important to practice the hand and the eye. Your exemple
    of Man vs. Machine represent perfectly the dichotomy here. Where a part of designer
    looked at the machine as the perfection needing the design to be aim at, humanists
    fonts look at differences and particularities as a good thing. In that sense,
    the subject could also be seen thought the lenses of the debate of general v.s.
    the particular.\r\n\r\nI still have to find information on the Myriad typeface
    but obviously will looking somewhere else. William Berkson (3 posts before), was
    writing about the process of designing Myriad by two persons (and the exchange
    during the process) resulting in a \"more impersonal, less idiosyncratic\" font.
    If it's true, it would probably be an interesting path as Myriad is seen as a
    more generic font even if it's a humanist one. Seeing also Myriad in relation
    with other humanistic typeface would probably inform us a little about the amount
    of the handmade, calligraphic original, wished to be kept in the process of \xABr\xE9aliser\xBB
    a humanist typeface. \r\n\r\n"
