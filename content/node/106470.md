body: "New to design!\r\nI have very little experience and only just started to act
  on my interest in typography.\r\nThis was mostly a dabbler's interest, until recently.\r\nI
  submitted my first font, called Whale, to MyFonts. They promptly rejected it and
  basically said it was totally unprofessional. It's meant mainly for display, so
  I don't know why I bothered submitting to them in the first place, but I now have
  a stronger desire to make this font as good as it can be. Maybe even simplify it
  for use beyond just displays.\r\nMy feelings will not be hurt. I would greatly appreciate
  a serious critique of my design so that I can make the next version of Whale far
  better.\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n- Stigmaa"

  body: also, ignore the graphic at the top of the PDF. I did not create it. I just
    made the file for personal use.
