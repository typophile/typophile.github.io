  body: American type foundries at this time did not have large inventories of typefaces,
    so the typefaces often didn't have distinguishing names. My facsimile copy of
    the 1829 A. W. Kinsley & Co. Foundry in Albany, NY shows similar faces, but they
    are distinguished only by their size (Small Pica, Pica, Brevier, English, Canon,
    etc.)
