  \"justify\" in typography.\r\n\r\nHas it become acceptable to use such terms as
  \"justified left,\" or \"left justified\"? Does anyone else wince at this? \r\n\r\nI
  was taught many years ago that type can be set centered, justified, flush left or
  flush right. Those were the only choices. There was no such thing as \"justified
  left\" or \"justified right.\" Sometimes we would add \"rag right,\" or \"ragged
  right\" to the \"flush\" direction, or abbreviate \"FL/RR,\" for example. Perhaps
  the \"rag\" language has dwindled. Specifying the rag was extra clarification. But
  in my mind, one should only use \"justified\" in one way, when both sides of a column
  are flush. Am I right?\r\n\r\nMaybe some younger members can tell us what schools
  are teaching these days. Do I just have to take a Xanax and accept these mixed terms,
  or am I justified (heheh) in my indignation on this matter?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Sullivanj, you are correct about the use of "justified". But I think the term
    "left aligned" is replacing the term "flush left".

  body: I was taught to say "flush left, rag right", and most of the designers I know
    still say that. But most of my designer friends are middle aged or older, and
    terminology can change over time. Maybe the younger ones are using different terms.

  body: "There is one context in which I frequently come across terms such as \u2018left
    justified\u2019 or \u2018right justified\u2019: These appear as button labels
    in an obscure little lay-out software called\u2014wait for it!\u2014InDesign.
    \u2018Left justify\u2019, for instance, refers to a justified setting in which
    the last line is left-aligned (or right-aligned for \u2018right justify\u2019
    or centred for \u2018centre justify\u2019). In other words: These terms do have
    a meaning, and a useful one to boot. All the more, I would try to avoid calling
    flush left, ragged right settings \u2018left justified\u2019 (or the other way
    around, \u2018justified left\u2019). InDesign, by the way, calls these settings
    \u2018align left\u2019 (and \u2018align right\u2019 and \u2018align centre\u2019).
    A setting in which even the last line is spaced out to full column width is called
    \u2018full justify\u2019."
