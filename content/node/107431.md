    have been clipped, perhaps from a Caslon derived font.\r\nThe particular clipped
    g is found in a few fonts.\r\nFor example, the Rita Smith font by Claude Pelletier
    http://www.dafont.com/ritasmith.font?fpp=50&text=%26g \r\nClaude based his font
    on an old design, Primavera of Rita Major.\r\nThe Walmart retail chain also uses
    a clipped g for its George label:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/george21_4439.jpg]\r\nAs
    for the & it looks like 8 with a tail.\r\nDon"
