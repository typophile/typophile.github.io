  body: "If the character display and printing routines of an operating system require
    fonts to specify a glyph for a non-breaking space, this allows them to make it,
    say, a different width than a regular space. Since the only distinction between
    the two entities is supposed to be how they behave when breaking lines of text,
    these routines should instead \"eat\" the non-breaking space, and ask the font
    for a regular one.\r\n\r\nHowever, that's just my personal opinion based on general
    principles. What font designers would really need to do is consult the OpenType
    standards (or TrueType standards, or whatever) to find out what they are required
    to do in order for their fonts to work properly on all applicable platforms.\r\n\r\nI've
    found some threads with information about this:\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/68985?page=1]]\r\n\r\nA
    font with a nonexistent nbsp character will cause problems in the Opera browser,
    and\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typophile.com/node/51198?page=1]]\r\n\r\none with an nbsp
    character that's the wrong width will cause problems in InDesign."

    SPACE) are assigned to the same glyph. 'uni00A0' is also a valid name for the
    none braking space.\r\n\r\nEigi\r\n\r\nPS\r\nhex codes in old style figures are
    looking curious ;-)"

  body: 'The system fonts on your computer are not a useful reference for font mastering
    because many of them have not been touched by human hands in 10 or more years.
    Time passes. Software changes. Word 2007 and 2010, for instance, also require
    an nbspace character. '

title: If the nbspace glyph is important, why do I find many widely used and popular
  fonts that don't have it?
