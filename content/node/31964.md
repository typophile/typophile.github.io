  really hope you can help me\r\nbecause i find that it was really difficult to search
  the info of 'Impact'\r\ntomorrow is the deadline,so help me!!\r\ni have some question
  now\r\n(These questions are about the relationship between the fonts \"Schmalfette/
  Haettenschweiler\" and \"impact\")\r\n \r\n1. The font \"Haettenschweiler\" came
  out from another font \"Schmalfette Grotesk\"? So why desifners use \"Schmalfette\"
  with impact together?          \r\n \r\n2. What's in the impact family?  \" Impact
  Wide\" \",Impact Wide Italic\" ,\"impacta\"and\"Impact\u2122 Roman\"  are the members
  of the impact family?\r\n\r\n3. In the net, I saw \"Impact has a high x-height\",
  what's\" x-height \"means?   \r\n \r\n4. The last question, I found out that Impact
  is a trade mark of \"Stephenson & Blake.\" but I also found out impact is a trade
  mark of \"Ascender Corp\". Which one is True? (Besides, the impact wide came from
  Ascender Corp instead of Geoffrey Lee? )                    \r\n\r\nofcourse~ if
  there are any other info of Impact tell me too\r\n\r\nThanks for help!! I'd appreciate
  any of your answers\r\n"

  body: 'Well, the only one I can answer offhand is #3. [[x-height|X-height]] is a
    comparative measure of the height of the lowercase letters (e.g. a letter x) to
    the height of the capitals or ascenders. Impact has a high x-height because there
    is not a huge difference between the height of the lowercase and uppercase. Something
    like <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nicolas-cochin/>Nicolas Cochin</a>
    has an unusually small x-height.'
