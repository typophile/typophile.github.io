  appears similar to Aldus, but it's not; the r is especially hard to match. Any ideas?

  body: 'Thanks, Michael. You''re right, of course: to suggest that it was similar
    to Aldus was indeed a type error. However, Belwe isn''t it either. Its T serifs
    angle inward and the upturn on the r is sharp, not curved (see the following image
    for comparison). Identifont''s "by similarity" engine didn''t suggest any good
    solutions, by the way. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Belwe_Tr_5649.jpg]'

  body: It looks rather sketchily drawn to me. The serifs look stuck on, and are not
    the same size on both sides of the T, and are different shapes on each side of
    the r's foot. I doubt this is a commercial font.

  body: Seems similar in structure to Perpetua Bold to me, but Perpetua doesn't have
    that ear on the r. And yeah, I'd agree with Bendy that this looks pretty thrown-together.
