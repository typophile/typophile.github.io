  brands.\r\n\r\nFor example, Nokia uses the custom designed nokia sans for their
  advertising (designed by spiekermann if I'm not mistaken), Xbox 360 has the convection
  family, etc.\r\n\r\nAny other well-known brands that people could share?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nChristian"

  body: "Interesting bit of serendipity there - I was going to ask about the status
    of the Macromedia font (Vonnes) in another post; now that Adobe have swallowed
    them and re-branded their products it may fade into font obscurity.\r\n\r\nRather
    than a second recycle of the [[http://www.typophile.com/node/4252|old Vonnes thread]],
    does anyone know if it's become available to the public now? I rather liked the
    ampersand for my sins\u2026\r\n\r\n<strong>Addition:</strong> Really should research
    before asking, bad typophile!\r\n\r\nAnyway, for the original question. Vonnes
    is a font custom designed for a well-known (ish) brand! :D\r\n\r\nFrom [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Vonness|Font
    Bureau:]]\r\n\r\n<em>Vonness was designed by David Berlow working closely with
    Neville Brody on corporate redesign for Jim Von Ehre at Macromedia. Core weights
    are loosely based on Bauer\u2019s Venus, 1907\u20131910. Berlow expanded the ideas
    behind the series to 56 fonts, the heart of the redesign. The Macromedia program
    was hailed as one of the most successful models of modern total design for innovative
    cutting edge companies; FB 2007</em"
