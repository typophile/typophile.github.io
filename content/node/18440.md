body: "I need to find a condensed sans that works reasonably well with Adobe Garamond.
  The sans face will be used in small size (about 6 to 7 points) inside a CD cover
  booklet so legibility and line length is an issue.\r\n\r\nI like Storm's Sebastian,
  but it's too wide.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

    choice.

    design and its audience. Tell us more about the CD.\r\n\r\nThat said: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11020.0.0\">FF

  body: "I haven't studied the music too deeply because I have quite strict guidelines
    how to lay out the booklet; it has to look like a previously published song book
    - same graphics and all. So, almost no real creativity is allowed.\r\n\r\nThe
    song book featured Adobe Garamond for both titles and lyrics, but now I have to
    cram the same texts in a cd booklet and need a suitable sans typeface to that.\r\n\r\nMy
    staple choice News Gothic just didn't feel right for the job. \r\n\r\nStephen,
    FF Quadraat Condensed looks definitely interesting, the shapes and proportions
    have a \"garamond feel\". What worries me is that the regular weight looks a bit
    dark on the screen, considering it's going to be printed in a very tiny size (The
    booklet is propably printed on a coated stock, that of course helps a bit)\r\n\r\nTiffany,
    I don't know how I forgot DynaGrotesk, I have it even installed on my computer...
    I have to run some tests.\r\n"
