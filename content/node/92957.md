  \"Mercury\" reminds me of old timetables a wee bit, so that's my current candidate
  for the body text, but I still need a display face for headers and maybe 20pt-size-ish
  dates.\r\n\r\nSo can anyone think of a display face that has connotations of time,
  timekeeping, or numbers? Please nothing that is overtly specific to a specific technology
  like a font where each character is a digital watch or anything like that :)"

    of the resemblance to typical roman numerals on clocks.

    I think anything that has a retro or pastiche or scrapbooky or \"steam punk\"
    look is in fact very hip right now, and I think old timetables fall into all of
    those categories.\r\n\r\nI agree with the condensed didone idea, though many clocks
    that use arabic numerals use a fat face. As far as timetables go, something like
    Trade Gothic would be standard, but wouldn't have that connotation out of context.
    Maybe also Roman inscriptional capitals, inline or not, as reminiscent of the
    carved numbers on sundials, etc."

    is nice, but I don't think it smacks of a clock unless I actually use roman numerals.
    I don't think I'd want to do that, as (a) it looks a wee bit pretentious (b) international
    students might not get it (c) dates are generally always in arabic numbers, at
    least in the UK.\r\n\r\n@Joshua Langman\r\nHm. Aptly named, but not aptly styled.
    \r\n\r\n@T\xE9 Rowan \r\nTimetables in the vicinity are boring. Boring, boring,
    boring! Some worker at the local council doing it in Microsoft Word. Then again
    I do live in Glasgow, perhaps some research into London timetable design history
    is in order. I might never get the project done if I start that though.\r\n\r\n@Nick
    Shinn\r\nOof, that is really nice. Tiny budget probably won't stretch to a new
    font. I might have a go at playing with Computer Modern, which in a roundabout
    way seems appropriate when a lot of students will be seeing articles written in
    LaTeX. I could show them a classy, InDesign-ed up use of their research paper

    is, though it will have a full colour and full bleed card cover. So there's room
    for establishing a style there before continuing it in black and white throughout.
    I love the idea of tea-staining each diary but that would be laborious for six
    thousand copies or thereabouts, and I doubt the university admin would let it

    appearing as \"15\" and \"May 2012\" with everything else at 10pt body text size.\r\n\r\n@hhp
    Tres interesting. Can you say more about what you mean by errant pixels? Could
    always go in the opposite direction and be futuristic! Lots of free amateur fonts
    made of blocks and pixels. Maybe even go all the way into the Twilight Zone...

    Some of these suggestions imply pages that look extremely old (wood type, etc),
    but the original poster mentioned \"a 1950s diner\" which is obviously much more
    recent.\r\n\r\n> Unfortunately this is b&w and no chance \r\n> of alternate paper
    stocks. \r\n\r\nIf buying paper stock that already looks old (such as parchment
    paper) isn't an option, you can create that look via artwork. Old paper darkens
    from the outside edges in. You can create this look using photoshop (there are
    tutorials on the internet), or you can purchase ready-made artwork for a few bucks
    at stock photography sites like iStockPhoto.com. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parchment2_3950.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    example above (which is color but could easily be converted to black and white)
    looks very old. If you're simulating paper from the 1950s, the effect would need
    to be much more subtle, with paper the looks good except for a slight darkening
    near the paper edges.\r\n\r\nHowever be sure that you can print from edge to edge.
    If the effect stops short of the paper's edge it'll ruin the effect."

  body: That's a good point, they can be trimmed to make the image bleed off the edge.
    But I'd be wary of having volunteers trim pages with old-fashioned paper cutters
    as you're likely to get inexact trims and uneven margins. But if the print shop
    has precision equipment designed for high-volume cutting, you're more likely to
    get professional results.
