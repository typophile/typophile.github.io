  their watch UI, it seems like a mix of Univers and DIN, like it's engraved, maybe
  they wanted to suggest a classic machined quality to the product.\r\n\r\nA good
  thing they are drifting away from Helvetica.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know something about
  it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Captura de pantalla 2014-09-09 a

  body: Perhaps of note, there also seems to be a soft/rounded version of the typeface,
    used for sport-related user interface.

    typeface is much cheaper for Apple than licensing one. \r\n\r\n\u201CIf you get
    a complete character set, including Cyrillic and what have you, it\u2019s way,
    way more expensive to pay licenses. If you\u2019re talking about millions of units
    at a cent each, that\u2019s a few hundred thousand dollars. You can design a hell
    of a typeface for that money.\"\r\n\r\nAlso there is branding. \u201CThat\u2019s
    been my other criticism about using Helvetica\u2014that\u2019s not their brand,\u201D
    Spiekermann says. \u201CAnybody can imitate that.\u201D Not so with a custom typeface.\r\n\r\n(He
