body: I love the warmth the serif font of this book by Sensus Design Factory, but
  I can't seem to identify it. Do anyone recognize it? [[http://www.sensusdesignfactory.com/4411/243547/work/marc-chagall-monograph]]

  body: "I found it, or actually I asked the designer (why didn't I think of that
    first?). It is Plantagenet Cherokee, which comes with Windows and OSX. Interesting
    that I didn't think of looking in the system fonts library first (or that WhatTheFont
    didn't know that) \u2026"
