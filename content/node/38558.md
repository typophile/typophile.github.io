body: "Hello everybody. I've just been asked a question that I found a bit strange:\r\n\"Do
  you know any sans typeface with the rt ligature?\" I was suprised, because I didn\xB4t
  think how we could have a reason for doing so, because the genesis of both letters
  doesn\xB4t justify it. My first reaction was \"Not even a serif typeface has that...!\"
  Even the queen of ligatures, Mrs Eaves doesn\xB4t have one, but someone is telling
  me that it's very common and that has seen it frequently.\r\nThe closest thing I
  saw was in carolingian script or a calligraphic exercise...\r\nPeople, what do you
  think of that? Was I blind or is that person crazy?"

  body: "I am guessing that a heavilly tracked sans had it's r & t collide producing
    a faux ligature. Some sans fonts are more prone to this than others. Looking at
    it a little it seems like the older the sans the more likely this is although
    I haven't looked in enough detail to make the claim stand.\r\n\r\nHere is an example
    of what I mean.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tracking_3611.gif]"

  body: "Thank you all for your opinion, but you've proven what I was thinking, so
    far, only the aestetics of a script or a serifed old style typefaces would justify
    that sort of ligature... :(\r\nThat's a fine design, Nick, got to take a look
    a it! \r\nFunny response Florian, but considering that I'm Portuguese, that kind
    of missunderstanding can\xB4t be applied ;)\r\nEben, that's a nice perspective,
    but the tracking is supposed to be zero. Besides, that kind of tracking starts
    to damage reading, especially for sans typefaces don\xB4t you think?\r\nThanks
    anyway :)"
