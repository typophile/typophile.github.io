  about releasing new fonts.\r\nI've just made one font and I'd like to test it, but
  I don't wanna send them font files until I check everything I can. \r\n\r\nDo you
  have any files you're willing to share that are made only for testing fonts?\r\nDo
  you know where to find it?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Besides these two good things to do, as mentioned above, these are som basic
    hands-on logical tests you also can do just make sure everything is working fine.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Make a full set of characters (every one of them) to see if every character is
    visible in a layout application.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Make outlines of all character
    in InDesign or Illustrator to see that everything is OK.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Install
    the font on a PC and a Mac and try the fonts in all available applications you
    might have (both professional apps and everyone-have-apps like Word, Powerpoint
    etc) . You could try all the different install methods available also when installing
    the fonts.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Make sure the font is appaering in the font menus with
    the proper name in the applications.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Put them in Suitcase/Linotype
    Font Explorer to see how they look there. Does it activate properly etc, is the
    font info looking OK?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Print from different applications."

  body: "For more \"technical\" (I hate that term but everyone seems to know what
    I'm talking about) testing:\r\n\r\nI would recommend Microsoft Font Validator,
    but it's hard to do that effectively these days as it does not appear to be readily
    link-able anymore. Perhaps sii or Sergey or someone at MS can post a current download
    link (and while we're at it: any news on an updated version being released anytime
    soon?). Font Validator is mainly geared towards TrueType-based fonts, but still
    provides useful feedback for CFF-based fonts.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend 'compareFamily'
    in the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/
    ; bit of a different approach than FontValidator (and suffers from an even worse
    signal-to-noise ratio), but can help spot major problems.\r\n"

  body: Ahem, that fontQA thing. It outputs an xsl file, but how do I display in a
    humanly readable format? Safari 4 beta only shows some jibberish, Internet Explorer
    8 shows the file content as does Firefox 3. Am I dim?

  body: "<em>So, if your kern all those \u2019non-sense\u2019 words you are right

    is a file <a href=\"http://www.lesliecabarga.com/\">Cabarga</a> made to test kerning
    pairs, but notice that it doesn't contain too many punctuation symbols. Quotation
    marks need to be kerned, too, and Kern King only has a few apostrophes (single
    quotes) in it. Ideally, you need to test every possible kerning pair, including
    punctuation.\r\n\r\nAlso, Kern King is not a substitute for the tools James Puckett,
    Tim Ahrens, nettoo, and j. hadley linked to earlier. "

    of juxtapositions of almost every glyph in the font against every other organized
    into sections for easy printing. I\u2019m actually about to add more pages that
    only show common kerning pairs. It\u2019s also worthwhile to run a paragraph of
    text in every language the font supports; just get copy from the Universal Declaration
