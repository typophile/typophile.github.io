  at Emerystudio, this morning I was given a student brief to design a logo for an
  apartment development and I went a little of the track and design a new typeface
  from some pen doodles that i did when I was bored,\r\nthis is the first version,
  all done in Illustrator, Id love some feedback so that I can develop it in font
  lab and use it for a 3rd folio piece ( Im studying Visual Communication at MONASH)\r\n\r\nsorry
  for the image low quality\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nmelanie yencken[img:sites/default/files/old-images/111Barkly-linefont_6434.jpg]"

    work for me. The k is tricky, it is working less well than the x & v. What do
    you think of it? '

  body: I love this! I agree with Eben about the W. I also think the 1 is too similar
    to a 9. It would take the context for me to tell what it was. Also could the Y
    have a double line at the bottom? But I think this is really terrific and quite
    original. I can see this being a success with a bit of work!

  body: "This is interesting. It has potential for some cool alternate characters,
    not to mention the ligature possibilities. Also, a lower case 'w' has to have
    a center stroke that partially meets the x-height in order to look balanced, same
    goes for an uppercase 'W'. On some rare occasions this not true. \r\n\r\nI understand
    that this is a mock up, but with such a simple approach to a typeface, i.e. grid
    bound, you have to follow the rules of the grid and create characters with consistent
    themes and \"color\". Some of the most simple typefaces are the most meticulous.
    Look at Wim Crouwel's faces for example. \r\n\r\nLastly, I would try making the
    diagonal strokes on the 'k, v, w & x' meet flush with the x-height, that is have
    them be squared off on the ends.\r\n\r\nGreat Job, looks cool."

  body: "I like this - it's a good idea for an apartment development, it has an architectural
    quality that also puts me in mind of Piet Mondrian. I could envisage that on the
    side of a building in sheet steel of maybe 1 cm thick by 15 cm deep.\r\n\r\nWith
    a bit of refinement here and there it would look great. Make the n, u and y the
    same width as the b, d, g, o, p, and q. I'm sure you can sort the rest yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick

    it be more of Theo van Doesburg since he's got diagonals?  \r\n\r\nBack to the
    design, I could also see the r with a horizontal instead of vertical double.  Or,
    I suppose, you could put in some alt characters, there are lots of options with
    what you've got.  (and am I the only one with this odd desire for a complement
    font made of swirls based on the current one?)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una

    </cite>\r\n\r\nThis is a good point. But I would ad a knob to the arm of the r
    and instead make the crossbar of the t double. \r\n\r\nMany of the problems in
    your design won't emerge to you until you start setting things in it."

    the lines would actually disappear.\r\n\r\nI love it.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
