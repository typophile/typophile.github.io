  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>(This is a break away post from [[Please Read: Typophile (TEMP)]] because this discussion deserves to live outside of the comments on that thread)</p>
<p>To start, let me say that I am one of those individuals that has been strongly turned away from Typophile due to the overly harsh, pointless personal attacks and lack of respect for fellow human beings. But I have been following this discussion and the one on Type Board, hoping to find a return to civility that has been so sorely lacking. Well, I haven&rsquo;t been terribly impressed by either. One bans those seen as overly hostile and comes off as isolationist while the other is overrun by negativity, driving away those who truly want to contribute and learn. Truly unfortunate.</p>
<p>Quoting Hrant from [[http://typophile.com/node/91007#comment-499372|here]]</p>
<blockquote>But I don't think being gifted and being rude are mutually exclusive. To me anybody -talent or no- who can handle aspects of an environment that are unpleasant to him will derive more benefit from it, and will allow others to learn more from him as well.</blockquote>
<p>What doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger, eh?</p>
<p>Look, the internet is a marvelous place that allows for communication across vast distances and time. Awesome. In the early days, people realised that the anonyminity that the internet provided allowed us to say whatever we wanted and do whatever we wanted without fear of reprival. But the Type community is not large, is it? We know each other. I will likely talk to the lot of you at some conference or another in the next years. Since we are actual people who actually know each other, why should be insulting or antagonistic? Why can&rsquo;t we be civil? Surely there is enough humanity in us to rise above the common denominator of internet commentators.</p>
<p>The really sad thing is that I&rsquo;ve met a lot of you in person and you all seem like reasonable, friendly individuals. So why all the venom online? A number of folk I&rsquo;ve talken to say, &ldquo;Oh, but my internet persona is not who I am, it is separate&rdquo;. To that I say bullshit. As the saying goes, the real measure of a man (or woman!) is how they treat someone who can provide them no benefit. So what can be said of someone who <em>intentionally</em> attacks others for no good reason (either instigator or responder), regardless of the medium? And even if someone else attacks you first, who says you need to lower yourself to their level and respond in kind, perpetuating the cycle of hate? Who you are online is who you are. Do not deny it.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of good to come out of Typophile, and a lot more good can be gained through having a centralised location for discourse and communication. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose the extensive history documented here. That said, unless we all work to raise the quality of life around here, the community will continue to bleed and find other places to congregate. Once that voice is split, it will be significantly more difficult to regain it.</p>
<p>So I call on you all to check yourselves—don&rsquo;t demand that the moderators control people. Show that <strong>you</strong> care and control yourselves if you don&rsquo;t want to see this community die.</p>
<p>No, you can&rsquo;t solve a problem by censoring it, but you can chose to respond and act  with civility.</p>

<p>Thanks Aaron. It&rsquo;s easy to point fingers and demand moderation, blocking and banning - and a lot harder to simply hold oneself to a higher standard. There are only a few people behind Typophile trying to make things happen, and the community easily outnumbers us 50,000 to 1. Any community will have strong personalities and differences of opinion. We need to pull together.</div>

<p>One’s skin is only so thick, and it’s not pleasant being a whipping boy.
Frankly, if you want to stay around, giving as good as you get is the best way to discourage ad hominem attacks—that is, if the forum does nothing to censure the attacks in the first place.</p>

<p>How does holding myself to a higher standard improve Typophile and create an environment where type professionals will flock. 
Are we supposed to engage Hrant in civil discussion and that will somehow improve the situation? When old Hrant posts are deleted in a clandestine manner due to some back door dealings, we&rsquo;re prevented from having civil discussion. Nick has pounded that rock for years and it just doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>If I were running this place I could improve it by deleting one account . . . simple as that. The people that run this place act as if not deleting Hrant&rsquo;s account is virtuous. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s weak and it&rsquo;s ruined this place.</p>

including two that you mention yourself. As I said in the
other thread, I left Typo-L voluntarily about 8 years ago

with even the person who triggered my departure leaving
himself within months.</p>
<p>And why do you assume your breed of &ldquo;type professionals&rdquo;
is the only reason Typophile should exist? If you want this
place to simply be some sort of guild, you won&rsquo;t find enough
support to make it useful to enough people. You really need
a private list, like ATypI&rsquo;s*. One reason is that the type of
person you describe typically does not commit the time to
share much help without a strong chance of reward.</p>

<p>Whether a person is lazy or not, isn&rsquo;t your opinion of a person&rsquo;s work ethic somewhat detrimental to the population of the global typography community at large? Or do you think there should a sticky posted in the General Forum stating  student&rsquo;s appropriate work ethic?</p>
<p>Or perhaps there should there be a Student&rsquo;s Forum?</p>
<p>Just curious.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t contribute to Typo-L much but watched you ruin it. By the time you left, a lot of pretty major names in the type world had already gone and a lot of them ended up here in the early days of Typophile. Of course, I can&rsquo;t prove that those people left because of you but that&rsquo;s what i think it was.</p>
<p>If it was a less open to the rabble, professionals would want to stick around more. Only you and a few other type professionals have the patience to sort through hundreds of Hrant posts and other junk every week. The reason you never see a critical mass of type professionals in one place is because of you. You&rsquo;re a highly influential person: highly influential in ruining everything you touch.</p>
<p>If the measure of a good type forum is one in which there are lots of Hrant posts then this must be the best.</p>

Is type deign art?</p>
<p>That kind of stuff. I welcome smart student questions. There' s nothing wrong with being a student. There is something wrong with being a lazy student.</p>
<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t think anyone gives a rat&rsquo;s ass if I go away or not. I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people here would be happy to never see another post from me. But I&rsquo;ve got years of experience and knowledge that might be valuable in some way. I also don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m the only experienced font designer who tends to avoid this place because they&rsquo;re not discerning about who joins and who gets kicked off.  If you want a forum where anyone can join and anyone can say anything, it&rsquo;ll have less and less experienced professionals to lend their knowledge.</p>

<p>And no, I&rsquo;m nowhere near new to Typophile. I&rsquo;ve was a member here as Hiroshige (represent!!) since &lsquo;07 and just recently as 5star.</p>
<p>I get a kick out student questions - especially the obvious ones who just downloaded a free trail of software, lol. But, still dig answering and sharing what I know. And that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about really. The choice of sharing - some do some don&rsquo;t - whatever, it&rsquo;s all good because it represents the global community at large.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also one of the people who has only checkin in here a little in recent years, mostly because of the issues outlined by others, which boil down to topics that don&rsquo;t interest me, spam, and personal attacks.</p>
<p>Ever since I join over 6 years ago I&rsquo;ve been amazed at how personal people get on here, and agree with the call to all grow up and stop it. In any community there are people we don&rsquo;t like or get on well with. It&rsquo;s normal.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the idea of exploring ways to filter posts/topics so that I only see the stuff that interests me. Giving options to flag/rate/filter posts and topics if a good idea. Or maybe adopt a friend/follower model, so I only sign up the feeds of those I wish you listen to.</p>
<p>I agree Typophile has a lot of good stuff buried in it, I hope one way or another we can get past the personal stuff and continue to let this place educate and inspire.</p>

like never before. Strangely, it&rsquo;s been very easy to do.
I&rsquo;m trying to put myself in their shoes, giving them the
benefit of the doubt, waiting for them to calm down, even
though I think they&rsquo;re mistaken in perspective as well as
behavior.</p>
<p>Ray, you know I can, but I don&rsquo;t want to nitpick your
points one by one; I&rsquo;m not even going to try to dispel
your Hrant The Destructor screenplay&hellip; When I said
&ldquo;OK&rdquo; to Aaron above, I meant it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a lot of people here would be happy to never see another post from me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be one of them. In fact I myself would like to
see you contribute far more than you typically have.
This also goes for any other designer (no matter how
few years they&rsquo;ve been around, or how much I myself
think their fonts are junk) who sincerely wants to help
others - it&rsquo;s that simple. To me participation is the key
to making a place more to your liking; and getting rid
of the &ldquo;competition&rdquo; only makes you weaker.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve seen this movie before. You (and certain
others) simply don&rsquo;t want to spend the time helping,
not because you&rsquo;re evil, simply because you like to
spend your time differently, which is OK; the thing
is, you also don&rsquo;t want to watch somebody you don&rsquo;t
agree with &ldquo;get away&rdquo; with saying his opinion - so it&rsquo;s
frustrating! But you can&rsquo;t translate that into &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the
problem, if he only left everything would be fine&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s
not really believable, because what would fill the void?
You still wouldn&rsquo;t have the time! That&rsquo;s what happened
on Typo-L, and it would happen again. Just participate
to your desire and ability - the rest is out of your hands.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s fix real problems, fixable problems, together.
Like the annoyance of spam, the attention-sucking
type-IDs, etc. Let&rsquo;s not expect smooth sailing for any
of our ideas in public. That&rsquo;s not how humans works,
that&rsquo;s not how culture marks progress.</p>

<p>I find some of the characters here have a bedside manner a little like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/">Dr. House</a>. But here&rsquo;s the advice: If Dr. House is a genius then you put up with his drama, attitude and insults. But, if Dr. House&rsquo;s work is not all that, then you can dismiss his advice and sidestep the drama.</p>
<p>So, go find the Dr. House that&rsquo;s irritating you. Look at his URLs, his work, his fonts. Does the work inspire you? Does it look like he must know what he&rsquo;s doing? Then pay attention and look past the bedside manner. But, if the work doesn&rsquo;t pass muster you&rsquo;re safe to ignore the whole package: ignore the advice and the work and the headache.</p>
<p>The one thing you can&rsquo;t do is act like Dr. House to get back at Dr. House. You will lose and it will drive you insane because Dr. House will win. If you find you&rsquo;re able to engage with Dr. House and come up with some awesome retorts: News Flash! You just might be a Dr. House yourself.</p>
<p>(Apologies to those of you who can&rsquo;t watch the show House MD. You&rsquo;re missing out on a good drama with a guy that is easy to both admire and dislike.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Typo-L was just as interesting after you left. The decline in posts was gradual and back then you didn&rsquo;t post 100,000 times per week. I&rsquo;m not opposed to you having opinions I don&rsquo;t agree with, Hrant. Most of the time I agree. I don&rsquo;t like how you flex your internet arguing muscles around here 24 hours a day. It&rsquo;s annoying how you have to lend your keyboard to every thread whether or not you really have anything to contribute or not.</p>
<p>Even as I type this I know I&rsquo;m wasting my time because you&rsquo;ll find some other angle to deflect my main point:</p>
<p>Hrant ruined Typophile (for me).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like to contribute, sometimes. But honestly–how do some of you find the time to contribute like 200 posts per week. It sucks so much energy to just read some threads, let alone contribute&hellip; when do you work, eat, sleep?? I like to help people when I can, but there are also other more important things to do.</p>
<p>My basic impression that Typophile has not improved in the last years, without pointing any fingers. Perhaps there are so many small threads that the interesting ones get buried? Also, I like to see many different professionals chime in, as it livens up the discussions. Some opinions of the frequent posters are well known to those who spend some time here, so need not be dragged into every thread, like some kind of meta-thread. A better filter for intersting posts (I completely ignore type-IDs, as they are a waste of time, and a lot of posters just leave the building when there is no solution ASAP) perhaps by flagging or ratings, and making these more visible so many professionals notice and are motivated to contribute. Perhaps increasing moderation so that simular threads somehow are combined or tagged, so as to stop from having the same discussion over and over. Follow up threads with clearly identifyable titles are a bonus&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m more bummed by the signal-to-noise ratio. Sure some folks can be annoying at times, but it&rsquo;s equally annoying, if not more so, to read all the people posting annoying comments about the annoying user.</p>
<p>And now here I am posting a comment about being annoyed by the posts people make about being annoyed by another poster.</p>
<p>And on and on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not part of the type community&hellip;just an avid fan who dreams of someday finding the time to devote to proper type design. So take my opinion for what its worth.</p>
<p>Either way, I much prefer online communities that use a light hand when it comes to moderation and banning. I also think that while there are some overly personal attacks here, there&rsquo;s also a lot of sincere critique that people take way too personally. A critique of work is not a personal insult.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps what we need is a sub forum called &ldquo;Antagonist/protagonist&rdquo; where divisive dialogue can be shunted.  This would allow those who like this sort of thing to have their OK Corral, if they so desire, without being banned or excommunicated. It would also allow the original thread to go on about the subject it was intended for. A link from the original thread could be provided for all those who wish to follow the fisticuffs .
The very big problem is, who decides this and how much time would it take? I would hope that we could all act enough like adults to just ignore those we find problematic and pursue those who we may individually feel have merit. This could be made easier by installing tools similar to &ldquo;Tracker&rdquo; that would allow anyone who chooses to select &ldquo;ignore &lsquo;Dezcom&rsquo;&rdquo; if they choose.  There might be another selection which says &ldquo;Follow &lsquo;Hrant&rsquo;&rdquo; if they so desire.
Again, I stop and think, but why control it? The answer always comes back to mature evaluation by the poster and reader.  There are a big bunch of fans of &ldquo;Type ID&rdquo; who deserve their place to converse.  Just because I have little interest in this area does not mean I think we should dump it.  I just ignore most of those threads. 
I sometimes ignore the Flaming threads and sometimes curiosity beckons a peek.  On any given day, I may have a higher tolerance than another. &ldquo;House&rdquo; is one of my favorite shows, I watch it often,but I am not a Dr. House kind of person.  I detest so called &ldquo;Reality&rdquo; shows and never watch them.  I do not wish to ban them from those who like that sort of thing.
Any way, after all that dribble I just posted, I admit that there is no solution to human nature.  I would rather let it be what it is than try to be a control freak and command everything. My personal solution is just &ldquo;To click or not to click, that is the question, whether it is nobler of the mind&hellip;&rdquo;</div>
