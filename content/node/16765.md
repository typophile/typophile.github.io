body: "Hi,\r\n\r\n   One of the glyphs that's giving me trouble in Inconsolata (see
  <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16444\">critique thread</a> for more discussion
  there) is the beloved at-sign. The problem is, of course, that in the classical
  shape there are four vertical stems that need to be squeezed into the width of the
  glyph. In most fonts, you can make the @ wide to accommodate all those strokes,
  but in a monospace font that is not an option.\r\n\r\n   There are a number of 3-stem
  variants, notably that of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=22&searchby=&searchID=&searchletter=&searchstr=courier&font_categories_checkbox=font_name_search&fontRendererText=altern%40tive+%40\">Courier</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=29&searchby=&searchID=&searchletter=&searchstr=letter+gothic&font_categories_checkbox=font_name_search&fontRendererText=altern%40tive+%40\">Letter
  Gothic</a>, but I find them kinda plain, and I feel that the central bowl lacks
  a-nature.\r\n\r\n   I sketched a bunch of 3-stem variants, and this is the one I
  liked best.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ats.png]\r\n\r\n   Since
  I haven't seen this particular variant before, my big worry is that it's too strange,
  and will stand out when people see it. Any opinions?"

    with the \"a\" on the baseline (or thereabouts). I know that this is a newer trend,
    but I think it reads more legibly\u2026 when the @ was first packaged inside fonts,
    it was used significantly less often than it is now\u2026 overall-line legibility
    was less of an issue then, I guess."

  body: "Thanks for all the comments. Here's the one I've decided on, for now anyway.
    It's most similar to Dan Sandler's.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/at4.png]\r\n\r\nDan
    Reynolds asked: <em>Raph, have you tried a lower @, one with the \u201Ca\u201D
    on the baseline...?</em>, and Pieter posted an example.\r\n\r\nYes, I considered
    this form, but decided against it because the chirality (direction of spiral)
    felt wrong. This font is intended primarily for code listings, and so gross similarity
    to traditional forms is important. So, not too surprisingly, I chose one not too
    dissimilar from the Courier precedent. It's kinda conservative, but maybe one
    of these more exotic proposals will find its way into an arty future font.\r\n\r\nUppercase
    @? This sounds strangely like the <a href=\"http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/WG2/docs/n2888.pdf\">proposal</a>
    for uppercase \xDF, but imho with less justification. We don't have uppercase
    $%&*, and the role of @ isn't that different.\r\n"

    stuck the trial characters into a string of Myriad letters. The idea I was testing
    is that the right kind of spiral, even though it is out of character with the
    alphabet--like the &--will still read as an 'at' sign in context, and will \"color\"
    better than the @ sign. \r\n\r\n--I notice that in Myriad they make the @ much
    thinner than the strokes of the letters, I guess because of color problems. Also
    true for Georgia, here on screen--is this general? Of course, if the idea of a
    spiral is sound, how to draw it appropriately will depend on the font. "

    that it would be good to have an alternative form of the @ sign are: 1. It always
    looks to me out of place, like a 'wrong font' character stuck in the middle of
    a line. 2. If it were only  in price lists, that would be OK, but now because
    of e-mail addresses it is not only on the internet, but in print on business cards,
    stationary, in books, magazines and newspapers. I don't know if there is a good
    solution along the lines of a spiral, but a more harmonious form than what we
    have would be an advance. \r\n\r\nAlso because it is relatively new for e-mail,
    people would be more likely to accept an alternative, if it looked good. This
    might be an exception to the general rule that type design is inherently a conservative
    art."
