body: I have noticed that the vertical stems of light sans type have inconsistent
  stem weights when printed on laser printers, even real 1200 DPI postscript printers.
  Is this just something that I have to accept and should design proofs that only
  show text at larger sizes? Should I hint the type before I run my proofs? Are the
  better printers that I can have print shops run proofs on for me?

    Fontlab.\r\n* Remember to delete all hints AND make sure the option to 'Hint font
    on export' in Fontlab is disabled.\r\n* Even blue-zones (vertical alignment zones)
    can make the printer do un-funny stuff.\r\n* Print in target size and in something
    like 4-500% and take a step back.\r\n* Get a magnifying loupe and study what happens
    in the target size, I have found that helpful in some instances.\r\n* Try rendering
    some text in Photoshop in the printers resolution and see how that compares to
    what you are seeing through the loupe.\r\n* Make sure your printer is not crap.
    Compare it to other printers. All printers have their peculiar rendering quirks."

  body: I believe hinting the fonts would help, because the stems would, though not
    be displayed 100% accurately, at least be rounded to the same (pixel) values.

  body: Well Jens, that depends which hinting parameters you are talking about, printed
    on which printer using which driver? High resolution devices are not really supposed
    to use hinting instructions, but never the less they sometimes render differently
    on the printed page if you change the hinting. The problem is the total lack of
    documentation of how printers <em>actually</em> render glyphs. It's the infamous
    'black box' where you can poke around inside of it with a knitting needle in search
    of clues as to what it contains. I have given up on finding the perfect printer.
    Some are too dark, some are too light, and all of them have issues with overshoot.

  body: "Claus, I was talking about hints on vertical and horizontal stems, together
    with the font-wide PS \"standard stem\" values which as I understand it make sure
    that similar stem widths are rounded to the same pixel/printer-dot values by the
    rasterizer.\r\n\r\nIn this respect it is a remedy for James\u2019 problem regarding
    the inconsistent stem weights. But of course it's not a good way to look at the
    details in the design phase of a typeface. All the methods you mentioned are preferable
    for that purpose. But you should anyway keep in mind that this specific rasterizing
    issue will not be present in the final, hinted fonts.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, usually
    there's a visible difference between unhinted and hinted fonts on a 1200 dpi printer.
    Perhaps that's not really a high-resolution device ;) My 1200 dpi printer suffers
    from the blue zone bug, btw, it suppresses overshoot at all (?) sizes."

  body: "Dear Jens, Nina et al\r\nThat overshoot problem is not on all HP printers,
    and I think it also depends on how the font-file was generated, the layout application,
    and how it was printed, eg. directly from the layout application or via a PDF,
    then in Acrobat or Preview \u2013 multiply that with OS version and printerdriver
    version and printer firmware version. If one was methodical, one could go through
    the mutations one by one and get closer to what is happening. I will probably
    not be that person.\r\n\r\nThe worst problem I've seen is a special variant of
    the overshoot problem, where characters with overshoot would simply be moved up
    the difference between the baseline and the overshoot under the baseline. A bizarre
    bug, never the less I've seen that one several times from Xerox colour laser printers.
    I've heard anecdotal reports of the general overshoot problem with HP printers,
    but it's not present on my Laserjet P2015 if that is any help. Be aware that these
    things are moving targets, things change from version to version of software and
    hardware, so don't rely on that old HP story be hold true on today's setup.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the standard stems, I seem to remember that the hinting settings are only supposed
    to be used from 300 dpi and down. Quite understandable there, but on 1200 dpi
    printers Georgia in 9pt has a H vertical stem width of 16 dots. One more or less
    would probably still be visible upon closer examination. The horizontal crossbar
    in the e is only 6 dots, so one dot more or less would relatively make much more
    of a visual impact. I still can't find any information on how this is implemented
    in printer drivers. If someone has some info on this please post it."

    Didn't know that before I got it, but it is still a huge improvement over my previous
    600 dpi LaserJet 6 MP (which had real PostScript ...).\r\n\r\nClaus: <em>Regarding

    also was under the impression that hinting was ignored on high-res devices, but
    I today looked into the Type1 spec and another book and can't find any evidence
    to support it. There is however a value, <em>BlueScale</em>, which controls at
    which point size the overshoot suppression stops working. But hints seem to be
    applied at every size.\r\n\r\nWhich seems quite logical to me now, because when
    type size or resolution increases, the absolute rounding error (1 dot) stays the
    same, but the relative error in relation to the stem width gets smaller. So hinting
    isn't ignored, but just becomes more insignificant at higher resolutions. So there's
    no real need to implement a limit for hinting in rasterizers.\r\n\r\nGeorgia,
    being a font with TrueType outlines, is a different matter. In TT-based fonts
    you can set specific ppm sizes above which alignment zones or all hints are ignored.
    (I'm not sure where to find these values in a decompiled font though ...)\r\n\r\nAnd
    to mention my printer again, usually I see the effect of hinting in TT fonts at
    normal text sizes too; a badly hinted TT font can really spoil the printed appearance.\r\n\r\nI
    completely agree with you that there are too many variables when it comes to hinting
    and printing :)"
