body: Has anyone tried TypeIndex.org's <a href="http://typeindex.org/widget.php">Font
  Finder widget</a>? More importantly, has anyone kept it in their Dashboard? If their
  database was much more complete (more fonts), would this single-function widget
  with a search field be valuable to any graphic designers here? It seems like it
  would be more useful if it included functions like their <a href="http://www.typeindex.org/search_associator.php">Font
  Associator</a>, but maybe that's overkill for a mini-app?
