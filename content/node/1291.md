  Data Logo"> <BR> <BR>Looking to re-vamp this logo for a client. <BR> <BR>Starting
  with the type. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for suggestions on a flexible sansserif
  face that will be used for the entire identity system. <BR> <BR>The mark will remain
  virtually unchanged, except for some minor improvements. I will use this type in
  the actual mark, as well as for the body text of all printed materials -- so it
  needs to be somewhat flexible. Cobalt data is a database and programming/development
  software company. Not selling software, but strictly development for clients, mostly
  server side applications. <BR> <BR>Looking for something to reflect this, something
  with a touch of a technical feel, but something that could be flexible enough to
  set body text in, for example NOT a titling face. Preferably 3 or so weights, small
  caps and ligatures are always a plus, especially considering the amount of acronyms
  in an IT field such as this. <BR> <BR>So, suggestions? Also the customer is looking
  to stay in the $150 ceiling price range. <BR> <BR>thanks! <BR> <BR>hildebrant. <BR>

  body: Kyle, I think you need something that has some rigidity -that&#39;s what seems
    to make a face feel &#34;technical&#34;- but too much and you move away from text
    usage. So something like DIN or Signa or Conduit is a bit too rigid, to the point
    of losing too much readability. Dax is cool, but maybe a bit too funky. I&#39;m
    thinking something like Taz, or one of the more rigid Spiekermann/Schaeffer designs.

  body: 'I&#39;m not a big fan of using the same font for a logo and the text. I feel
    the logo should stand alone, unique in character. But for CI purposes, establishing
    a sans and a serif that reflects the feel of the clients goals is imperative.
    I&#39;d be tempted to go techno for the logo type and be less dogmatic on which
    sans or serif faces you propose for this client. Remember most people using this
    site won&#39;t get it anyway, they are more concerned with content than the shapes
    of the letters, especially in text size formats. Plus you have another consideration,
    on text on their site that changes regularly, you will have to pick a font that
    is pretty universal and on most computers. Its not a simple chore. Dan '

    <BR> <BR>This is not something for web consideration, obviously the CI will follow
    through to the website, but the focus here is printed colaterals. <BR> <BR>I can
    see your point on the different faces, although in the circumstance, I have had
    a hard enough time convincing the client to even purchase one face, let alone
    two. I&#39;m also quite aware of the use of web fonts. Verdanna, Sanserif will
