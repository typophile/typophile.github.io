    you search without entering anything, but it would be nice to have a browse function."

    has got be good, but...\r\n\r\nThe website is very cold and looks built from a
    template.\r\n\r\nIt's confusing too. What \"high quality font software\"?\r\n\r\nWhere's
    all the lovely the font samples?\r\n\r\nThe logo is typographically very poor...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DTPTypesLogo_5210.png]\r\n\r\nYour

  body: The DTP Types outfit (www.dtptypes.com) sells the usual rip-off fonts under
    new and old names (e.g. Century Schoolbook DT, Engravers DT, Goudy Old Style DT,
    Kabel DT, etc.) and is also an outlet for the customary "inspired by" knock-off
    stuff produced by other forgers, cloners, pirates, and plagiarists.

  body: "lherrou and wormwood, many thanks for taking your time to look at the web
    site. It is hoped that the site will develop over time as more designers and developers
    join the site.\r\n\r\nlherrou - how would you like to browse the fonts? You can
    list the fonts by name or do a more detailed search by keywords. Every font can
    be tested also.\r\n\r\nAll comments are welcome at this stage - be they helpful,
    rude or sladerous."

  body: "I recognize these designs by their original names. Slightly manipulating
    Times Roman, Optima, Icone, Franklin Gothic, Sabon, Tekton, does not make them
    new or original. Many of the designs are identical to the originals they're derived
    from. Your client base, and any designers who might want to join you, are going
    to be limited by that. \r\n\r\nThere is a wide, wide difference between what is
    strictly legal, and what is ethical. "
