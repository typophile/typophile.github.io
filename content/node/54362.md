  circulars that display 'pricing' and short callouts like 'SAVE $99'. I'm designing
  some ecommerce related digital material, but have never worked with circulars. If
  anyone has worked with print circulars or anything related, can you please share
  some great typefaces I can use.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n-dub"
