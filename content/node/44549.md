  concatenated into a single large list (perhaps two; although the 2nd usually looks
  suspiciously like the first). Should one reconstruct the aalt table by looking up
  <em>every</em> possible 'complete' list in the rest of the features? Even then,
  the MinionPro.fea sample from Adobe (revision 2.012) shows some additional lookups
  added to the aalt table.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this was never meant to be re-engineered

    to do that. Go to http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/ and download ExampleRomanFonts.zip,

  body: "Thanks, Miguel. I read the entire specs before, but seem to have missed this
    exact definition ...\r\n\r\nAs for the reverse-engineering, well yeah, I have
    seen the Minion Pro feature file. What I'm hoping for is the reverse: given any
    font, get a (reasonably) correct feature file out of it. The MinionPro-Regular.fea
    is my target output, and I'd like to produce a comparable file by reading and
    parsing MinionPro.otf.\r\n\r\nReading the specs, it sounds it's possible by including
    all tags which define <em>any</em> single glyph input substitution. That would
    (correctly) exclude 'frac' in the Minion sample, as this does not contain single
    input glyphs at all, as well as 'ss02' (that one has an explicitly mentioned workaround)."
