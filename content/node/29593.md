    most typefaces that \"mimic\" foreign characters end up looking really cheesy
    and many times are a condescending stereotype. Your closest bet is to go with
    a decent script face, since most handwriting even across cultures tends to certain
    similarities, yet can get as wild and foreign as you want.\r\n\r\nMyfonts.com
    has a sale on a script typeface called Majidah that sounds like it might fit your
    bill."

    admit they are slightly cheesy (pun inevitable), but can be used effectively.
    Most of these type of faces are used for menus anyway, so we thought we might
    as well reflect that in the choice of names. All other names that came up tended
    to be racist or dangerously political.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/falafel_3651.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/bagel_3625.jpg]"

    revival that sounds like what you're looking for. On the same spread in the Solo
    book is also <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/civilite-urw/\">Civilite</a>,
    which is of course based on a French rather than Arabic model, but has the curvaceous
    scriptiness without the cheesy stereotype.\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/legende/\">Legende</a>
    and its derivatives, including Caliph. There are a couple others on the Solo page,
    like \"Timbuctu\" and \"Persian,\" but they're even cheesier than Falafel, so
    I wouldn't bother trying to track down digital versions.\r\n"
