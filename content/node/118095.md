  of one of the assessments I had to design a logo for the Geelong Football Umpires'
  League and gather feedback on the design.\r\nSo here is my design. Any feedback
  would be great.\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo2_5949.jpg]"

  body: "A logo should always work in one colour, and at multiple sizes.\r\nYour choice
    of fonts is very cartoon like.\r\nThe whistle doesn't indicate what game the Geelong
    Football Umpires' actually umpire.\r\nI would try to incorporate some aspect of
    the game.\r\nAlso your whistle is very cartoonish.\r\nUmpires are professional
    people who do a serious job.\r\nYou need to use cleaner less frivolous fonts,
    and more stylish adult artwork.\r\nWith less 'garish' colours. The cyan you've
    used is way too loud.\r\n\r\nI did a quick search in Google for 'umpire logos'\r\n\r\nThese
    were my favourites.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SEJ_UMPIRING_LOGO-1_6273.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PBUC_400px_splash_4561.gif]\r\n\r\nand
    the football teams themselves seem to use an clean illustrative style, like these.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/North_Melbourne_Football_Club_Logo_6109.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/url_5393.jpg]\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    you could develop something along a similar line so it fits in with the games
    overall branding style."

      four lines that are in the circle of the whistle are meant to represent the
      game of AFL which are the goal post's used in the game, however unless you live
      in Australia you wouldn't know otherwise.\r\nonce again thank you for your feedback
      and comments."

  body: "You've obviously rushed that, as it's not very well aligned.\r\nThe typefaces
    should be the same weight or at least complimentary styles.\r\nI also think for
    a Geelong football logo the font should have a stronger, bolder, more masculine
    feel.\r\n\r\nThe words Geelong follows (badly) the oval shape in a fan shape,
    where as the Football Association (also badly aligned with the curve of the ball)
    follows the vertical Arch shape.\r\n\r\nAlso the 4 lines are not equal distance
    from the out edge of the ball.\r\nThis is very sloppy, and really shows a lack
    of care. In future look at every aspect of what you design.\r\nAs a tip to see
    if it's balanced, you should also check it out in a mirror.\r\n\r\nI'd say you've
    still got a long way to go yet, but you can do it.\r\n\r\nWhat about a stylised
    whistle in outline, have you tried anything like that yet.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-02_6641.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    or hand signals, or extra gear?\r\n\r\nHere's one you can have from me. It's got
    the whistle shape, the Gee, and the 4 football stripes. :)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    shape.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen shot 2014-07-24 at 10_4302.12.23.png]\r\n\r\nor
