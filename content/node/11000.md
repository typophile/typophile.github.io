  body: Now <b>THAT</b> is a great use of decoration! I really like this. A lot! What
    was your inspiration? Why was it created? And, did you start with another face
    as your skeleton? It looks like Industria a bit under the skirt too.

  body: Nice catch on Industria, Tiff. It hits on it in a lot of ways. <BR> <BR>I
    think the ornamentation works really well on most of <BR>the glyphs. The &#39;f&#39;
    and &#39;t&#39; could use a more substantial <BR>crossbar. The numbers are beautious.
    I&#39;d just relook <BR>at the &#39;4&#39; and &#39;7&#39;. Those are difficult
    shapes. <BR> <BR>I think the quotes and commas need more bulk too. <BR> <BR>Wicked
    division sign! In fact I would move to call this <BR>font &#34;Wicked&#34; if
    there wasn&#39;t already one. How about <BR>&#34;Osborn Wicked&#34;?

  body: 'In response to Tiff: <BR> <BR>This typeface was created based on a modular
    form with minimal elements juxtaposed with varied calligraphic components.  I
    wanted to create an aesthetic that reflected a sordid, but confidently structured
    attitude.  The second line uses the &#34;snap-on&#34; dots I&#39;m working on;
    depending on the form of the word it may be desirable to have dots on a character.  Also,
    I may employ snap-on ascenders/descenders that face the opposite direction.  Any
    suggestions?   <BR> <BR>P.S.  I&#39;ll try to check out Industria.  <BR>          Thanks.  '

    drawn <BR>to &#40;of all things&#41; the Zed. I think it might look  <BR>too much
    like the S. Also, the k might be  <BR>mistaken for an h - especially at small
    sizes. <BR> <BR>But I <i>really</i> like it. <BR> <BR>-sean michael

    he used to do Michael Moorcock covers and very innovative lettering back in the
    &#39;70s. <BR> <BR>Definitely fantastic stuff.... can we see some text laid out?

  body: You may want to change the plan of your o; there&#39;s not a lot distinguishing
    it from an a. If an unbroken o is out of the question, you could put the barb
    at the other end, which would be more suggestive of the little loop typically
    on a script o.

  body: great letterforms, the first word that came to mind when i saw them was &#34;wicked&#34;
    and then i started reading and saw i wasn&#39;t the only one who that that reaction,
    so it seems that wicked works for us here in the southwest as well &#40;maybe
    it&#39;s only utahns who don&#39;t git it, &#42;jab&#42;&#41; i second the motion
    to rename the font incorporating the term into the name. anyhow, i&#39;ll let
    the others point out the problems, but can i requsest an updated version of any
    changes you&#39;ve made?

    in my visits back here for awhile! \r\n\r\nHrant ... glad you caught the intended
    wordplay of jest/gesticulate, not just in naming and the act of \"jesting\" it,
    but on the gestural and jestful qualities of the forms. \r\n\r\nThanks everyone
    else for the push toward \"wicked\" in the naming, but I was trying to and typically
    steer away from words that promise to emerge as \"buzzwords\" in everyday speak.\r\n\r\nKeep
    'em coming! I really appreciate all the input! "
