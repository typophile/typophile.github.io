  with metal typesetting: How would you think the \u201Ci\u201Ds in the figure below
  were printed? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ivarianten_3664.jpg]\r\nI\u2019ve
  already got some ideas especially on the ones with separate strokes, but I\u2019d
  rather not bias your opinions.\r\nThe samples date from the years 1922 to 1924 [exception:
  I don\u2019t know about the origin of the middle and right sample in the upper row
  as these are scans I found from the web] and they are taken from the works of Kurt
  Schwitters.*\r\n\r\n<em>* Of course, this is copyrighted material. I consider uploading

  body: "The bottom example really shows how it was done. Note that the N does not
    join ... it is done with three pieces of rule, abutting. Thus I suspect that the
    dot is a bullet character built into the line above. It would be interesting to
    see what arrangement of furniture pieces was used to make those slanted rules
    sit as they do.\r\n\r\nThe top example is more likely a logotype cast in one piece.
    The thin strokes of the N make me fairly certain it would be cast metal, and not
    a wood type block."

  body: "Kristian, Don (Don: it\u2019s an i, not an N! ;-)), thanks so far. Both of
    your guesses go into the same direction that I thought possible. The clich\xE9
    or other type of \u201Cdone in one piece\u201D seems to be done differently in
    the two examples, though: I agree that the thin strokes could probably be cast
    metal, but in the lower right example (\"1924\") the left upstroke is not as smooth
    and the bottom of the stem looks curved or even carved (by hand?): [img:sites/default/files/old-images/i3_3673.jpg]\r\nThen
    again in the other examples, there are different types of rules: some are angled
    on one (or both) ends, others aren\u2019t. E.g. in the lower left example, there
    might have been used two different kinds of rule: the left one (first upstroke)
    being angled ~60\xB0 on the lower end, ~30\xB0 on the upper end, and the right
    one (second upstroke) twice ~45\xB0. I haven\u2019t worked with lead composition
    that much, and of course I don\u2019t have any idea about the actual usage of
    leaden rules (in Germany of the 1920s). If a typesetter had to do such a figure
    and did not want to produce any kind of clich\xE9, would he or she start filing
    the rules or were there special rules (for creating frames, I would think 45\xB0
    were a pretty good start\u2026) designated for such jobs normally available in
    printshops? \r\nI am inclined to ask the same question about the (bolder) central
    part of the two examples at the right in the first row (only, they are angled
    like \"//\" instead of \"/\\\\\").\r\nAnd, one more question: Do you think that
    the different \"i\"s in the first two lower examples are actually \"i\"s from
    a sansserif face with rules to the left and right or are they more likely to be
    constructed from a rule plus some kind of dot or bullet character?\r\nQuite a
    lot of more tricky questions, I would appreciate your answers! "

  body: "The letter was made by mitering the lines (Rules) up against a conventional
    letter. A letterpress bullet was placed on the top.\r\nThe spacing material to
    support it were also mitered at a 45 degree angle. It was an everday practice
    in the composing rooms of the past. I maintain a letterpress environment just
    to keep my head straight and I find it a way to unwind from the Mac."

  body: Stephan. That is pretty much how I would see the furniture sitting. It would
    depend on the size of the character, of course. It would also be possible that
    they actually would cut the wood to the proper angle, as they did with the rule
    used to make the I that looks like an N.

  body: "Stephen\r\n\r\nTo some extent, most of the \"historical avant-garde\" experiments
    would have been produced with time-honored printing practices. I think that Marinetti's
    page of 1918[?] (which interestingly is contemporary with Cobden-Sanderson's Genesis
    page) was produced simply by pouring molten lead into the chase to lockup the
    random configuration of the various metal type pieces. Nothing new about the practice,
    but there sure was about Marinetti.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the slanted lines are
    actually rule but likely large slashes that were undercut. Looks like the 2nd
    and 3rd examples are simply a lower case i snugged up against the slashes. First
    example could simply be a large point (period) turned sideways and cut to fit.
    All kinds of possibilities. But I don't see any need here for clever lockups.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\nThe

  body: "I had not been thinking of slashes. Or possibly a solidus. In either case,
    they would have been cut on a metal saw to fit flush against the I piece. This
    would be more stable than a slanted rule.\r\n\r\nI haven't got enough handset
    experience to know for sure. I do know that those guys could do some amazing things
    with the limited tools available."

    I thought that the upper left sample from the first image I posted here had been
    the original version, but that does not seem to be the case. My guess is now that
    the newer version has been created especially for the edition of Schwitters\u2019
    works done by Friedhelm Lach in 1974-1981, then reprinted <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/Die-literarischen-Werke-5-B%C3%A4nde/dp/383217883X\">[Amazon]</a>.\r\nI
