  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">A client has a question about comparing font point size. They would like our brand font to equal the same "size" as 12pt Times. As an industry standard, which of the following do you use to measure a font's point size when trying to compare 2 fonts?

   1. ascender to descender
   2. ascender to baseline
   3. x-height only
   4. cap height </div>

		<div class="commentbody">As Nick says, there is no standard, but unless you a dealing with all caps, the best apples-to-apples comparison is usually to equalize the x-heights. This will generally mean two different point sizes.

The other key limitation is usually length. If you want to set at the same length as Times, you can set a lower case alphabet and adjust the point size to match the length of a Times l.c. alphabet.

But every variable affects how a font will set, so there's no arithmetical way to do it—you have to try variations and use your eyes. 

By the way, Minion was I believe intended to be a competitor to Times as far as compactness, so that's one alternative that doesn't look like Times. Plantin is also similar, I believe, but looks more like Times, with more robust serifs.

Not sure how accurate that would be - you'd need to weight the calculation based on letter frequency in your language. Also when exclude caps?

Could also look at Liberation Serif, and MTI Thorndale - both built on TNR metrics.

		<div class="commentbody">If you are looking for a font to replace an existing font that is widely used, say the body text font for company communication...
1. I would just look at a prospective font side-by-side with Times to see how they look.
2. Be aware that with any font change, existing documents may be re-flowed on the page in word-processing or page layout programs, even if the fonts are designed to the same or close metrics.
3. Read about the appearance of fonts in Windows in the recent "Skolar & Mokka Test" thread.</div>

That's of course correct if you want to be exact. Matthew Carter, when he had the brief of meeting a certain length of an existing font, showed how he used an expanded alphabet with the number of a's b's etc. repeated according to their percentage frequency in English. Then the whole string set in the two faces would be a very accurate comparison. 

That still didn't include the caps, but they are less than 5%, I believe. Even in German they are not so much, I understand. 

Still, I think just the lc alphabet gives you a pretty good idea, without going to those lengths. 

If you are really going to match, then as you say you have to match the metrics of the font to be substituted for. But I assumed that wasn't the goal. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry if my question wasn't clear, but they want us to enlarge our 12pt Garramond font so that it visually matches 12pt Times.

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry, I think you’re going to have to match the x-height. 

When I’m consulting on a redesign and exploring different text faces for direct comparison (i.e., visually matching), then I’m pretty much using equalized x-heights. That’s usually the most significant factor for visual size comparison.</div>
