body: "Hello all\r\n\r\nI'm a novice type designer and I'm wondering how to formalize
  my ideas. I'm still working on paper but I want to start working on a grid. I have
  heard that the grid should be 1000 x 1000 units (em space in postscript?) but this
  seems quite extreme\u2026 I don't want to continue drawing at a randomly determined
  scale and I'm not sure I'm ready to begin drawing in vectors.\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Thanks Alessandro, they are all fine examples.\r\nThe type that I am working
    on however is neo-grot so the geometric constructions are harder to employ when
    drawing the curves. Do you know of other rules that govern the curves in such
    a typeface? Typical examples Univers, Helvetica, Akzidenz, and also more recent
    typefaces such as Akkurat. \r\nI have been reading Designing Type by Karen Cheng
    as this title seemed to crop up on this forum now and then. It covers the existing
    dimensions of various faces but does not detail exactly how they can be rationalized\u2026
    as always, any help is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks again"

    sans. The 1000 unit grid is part of the construction used by software to render
    a glyph. If you use FontLab, it defaults to 1000 units but this grid is not visible.
    It is used for scaling.\r\nIf you mean the proportions of stroke to counter, the
    world is open to interpretation. Why don't you just start drawing glyphs and see
    what works best for you?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

      the design on the shapes was based on glisette's?\r\n\r\n Definition of Glisette\r\n\r\n||Glis*sette\"
      (?), n. [F., fr. glisser to slip.] (Math.) The locus described by any point

      curve having no rotation at any instant.\r\n\r\n- Webster's Unabridged Dictionary

      for my last post I simply could not remember the name!\r\n\r\nI'm probably just
      being too pragmatic\u2026\r\n\r\nAs per usual, thanks for any help!\r\n"

  body: "You are absolutely right, you have nipped in the bud my tendency to do that
    now and then. I guess my reasoning behind it was based on my understanding of
    Futura, which although based on hard geometry is to a certain extent humanized\u2026
    however the geometry involved is very circular (not perfect circles as you well
    know) rather than based on curves/glissettes etc. Since we find beauty in maths
    I was wondering how I could reconcile the idea of geometry with type, simply by
    picking the right branch! In all honesty such maths is beyond my ability though
    so I will let sleeping dogs lie with this one I think!\r\n\r\nCheers folks!"
