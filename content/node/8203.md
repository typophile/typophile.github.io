body: I&#39;m kinda new here, but here goes the &#34;first post&#34;... <BR> <BR>There
  are obviously a proliferation of schools out there touting the new G5&#39;s for
  graphic design and things like that, but of the places you&#39;ve either attended
  or have heard of, which ones really do typography justice? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking
  to transfer in a few years and I&#39;m one of a few people around here that love
  type. <BR> <BR>enlighten me please.
