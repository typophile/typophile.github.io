body: "So I'm designing a book for my business of design class that features the work
  of 3 design companies that do restaurant design. Green Olive Media, AvroKO and Louise
  Fili. There's only one problem: Can't find any hi-res images of Louise Fili's work.
  I even searched in my schools library, which is pretty dang extensive on the design
  side. If anybody knows of some good books with samples of her work, mainly her logos,
  I would be greatly appreciative. I'm really trying to avoid just buying a bunch
  of books that she designed covers for and shooting them, but that will pretty much
  be my last resort. Also, if anyone has any of the logo books she designed for her
  self promotion back in the day, I'd be willing to trade some vintage communication
  arts or print issues dating back to the 40s - 70s : ) \r\n\r\n*Oh and my bad if
  I posted this topic in the wrong section, I'm new to this board*"

    real work, not just the stuff on a site)\r\nis to pose as a potential client,
    and ask to see examples of previous executions.\r\n\r\nIf your lucky you might
    get a nice hi-res PDF.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as your in education, I'd drop the pretense
    and contact them/her collectively on behalf of your class."

  body: Good luck with that. She's not very nice. But maybe you'll get an assistant
    or something.
