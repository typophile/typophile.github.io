  Notice Caps 001_6679.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis is from the cover of John McLaughlin OK Now
  album. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jon-mclaughlin-ok-now-cd-album-art-51654_4177.jpeg]\r\nThe
  backside of package, the face where they have the song list, display more fonts
  but I can't find it online and my scan result is not so illegible/sharp, so I did
  not post it. But the significant letter is the upper case R that the legs do  not
  meet, so there's a gap between the bowl and the vertical.\r\n\r\nThank you"
