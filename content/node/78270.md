  \ \r\n\r\nInteresting just to see how the type is set; complex fractions (all are
  all nut\u2014no virgules to be found), the @ symbol for per-item cost, page structure,
  impressive engravings for illustrations, and the thoughtful mix of typefaces. Quite
  a complex project for metal type. All for the kids.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-Cover_5982.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-title_3939.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-copyright_6737.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-page_3655.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-volume_6704.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-sphere-cylinder_3490.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-fractions01_5165.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-Divide02_3594.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-Divide01_4256.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-basket_6566.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gsa-at_cost_5439.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nYes,

  body: "I believe that nut fractions were the default for the modern style at the
    time, if not for all styles.\r\nAt any rate, I made nut fractions the default
    in Scotch Modern, which is my version of the face shown here.\r\nHowever, I only
    did the basic fractions\u2014half, thirds, quarters, eighths\u2014in pre-composed
    form (with arbitrary fractions in slash form), as I couldn't get anything more
    complex to work across the board in layout apps.\r\nIf this typographic layout
    were to be attempted today, it would be best done in an app which handles complex
    maths, probably in the Computer Modern typeface."

  body: From examples given in "The Manual of Linotype Typography" by Orcutt and Bartlett,
    p. 182-183, however, it should be noted that this sort of thing was within the
    capacity of a Linotype machine. I couldn't say whether that, or letterpress sterotyping,
    would be more likely in 1904, however.

    book is not on Google Books or the Internet Archive, several other books by this
    author are. Instead of being a teacher, he was a mathematician; he had written
    several books about the history of mathematics, as well as other textbooks for
    more advanced grades.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he was the compiler of one book that was
    still being reprinted into the 1960s: <em>A Source Book of Mathematics</em>."
