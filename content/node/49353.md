  body: "Nick's right, it is an Art Nouveau style, but none of the \"Nouveau\" results
    at MyFonts matched it very well. P22's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-mucha/|Mucha]]
    was similar, and TypeArt's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/miracolo/|Miracolo]]
    was another.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
