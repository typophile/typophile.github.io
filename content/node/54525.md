body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nI am new to this forum, and found it through a search engine
  searching for logo critiques. I have been doing web design for a long time now,
  and usually do okay with the design aspect of things, but am struggling with logos.\r\n\r\nMy
  church needs a whole new identity. I have created a simple logo, but am not sure
  if its good or not. I feel that it is very old school, doesn't really look anything
  like the new age stuff.\r\n\r\nI was trying to capture the aspect of the hilltop,
  and the crosses to resemble being a church. If someone could please give me some
  tips, and possibly even a new typeface to use. Really any suggestions are open.
  Please help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hbclogo_3909.png]\r\n\r\nBennie

    then pick up a pencil and start sketching out some ideas. Maybe you should abstract
    a cross somehow, maybe you want to work with a hill as your symbol, perhaps just
    writing the name out in a good looking way (without any symbol)? Are there something
    about you that make you unique? Are there any christian symbolic images you can
    use, like coming to the \"table\", hearing the \"message\" and so on \u2026 ?\r\n\r\nWhat
    you've got so far is Nike church:) "

  body: "I agree. It doesn't look bad, but it doesn't have the sort of distinctiveness
    yet that makes logos memorable, and makes them a cogent visualization \u2014and
    voice\u2014 of the institutions they represent.\r\n\r\nWhat I do when I start
    out with a new logo is try to find out what \"tone\" it should have, in what kind
    of a voice it should speak: loud or soft? Strong or smooth? Professional or fun?
    Like Frode said: What makes this church unique, what is its voice? Making a list
    of adjectives can help in defining the desired \"feel\" of the logo (and of the
    font used along with it). \r\n\r\nBTW, I was wondering if this is some sort of
    group of three churches / religions, one large and two small, as symbolized by
    the three crosses? (I don't see a church there, sorry :-| )\r\nIn a logo, everything
    has meaning; question every element, and leave only those in that *need* to be
    there.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would probably help to leave out color and gradients for
    now. Working in black & white only forces you to look for treatments that are
    original in a truly \"graphic\" way, and that also work in media/situations where
    no color can be used (the famous fax, inter alia); and once you work the color
    back in after you've found a formal solution that works, it will enhance it even
    more."

    thing, I suppose ... if that's what you wanted it could me made more compact and
    stronger quite easily.
