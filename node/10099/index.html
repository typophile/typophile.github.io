  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear typophiles,   <BR>   <BR>what follows is something I've done a few years ago    <BR>as a kind of warm-up exercise before a very different    <BR>job (which didn't turn out as expected BTW). I only    <BR>did then part of the lowercase set (the easier glyphs ;),   <BR>and five or six UC letters. Recently, I've come across    <BR>these files again and wondered if it would be worth the    <BR>trouble to revive and complete them.    <BR>   <BR>What do you think?   <BR>   <BR>   <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6871.gif" alt="karolehard.gif">   <BR>   <BR>There were three versions, which I'm calling <i>hard</i>,    <BR><i>soft</i> and <i>sharp</i>. The <i>hard</i> version was the less    <BR>incomplete, so it's the only one I'm displaying here.    <BR>The <i>soft</i> version would naturally be the one more    <BR>appropriate for text (well, would it?). I compare   <BR>the three below.   <BR>   <BR>   <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6872.gif" alt="karoletrio.gif">   <BR>   <BR>   <BR>The <i>soft</i> version is of course the most difficult and    <BR>demanding. I had a vision of how it should be, but    <BR>haven't been competent enough to do it back then    <BR>(or rather I didn't invest the necessary time on it).    <BR>But I guess <i>sharp</i> was the sexiest baby to me. ;)   <BR>   <BR>   <BR>   <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6873.gif" alt="karolesharp.gif">   <BR>   <BR>   <BR>General or specific comments are welcome.   <BR>   <BR>Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rodolfo, this is very nice - although I do have a weakness for semi-serifs. There's a bit of Unger, a bit of Granjon, and a bit of Times in there. But the result is totally original. <BR> <BR>I won't go into specific glyphs (yet). What I'd point out is that I think you need to make some text versus display decisions here (as you're already prepared to do, it seems). For example, the Sharp and the Hard are very well suited to display work (at large and moderate sizes, respectively), so the narrowness is right on. I agree that the color and contrast of the Soft make it the most suitable for text (while maintaining that rigidity I for one find priceless), but there the degree of narrowness will act against readability too much. <BR> <BR>The other thing I'd point out is that you're <i>mostly</i> avoiding the classic problem with semi-serifs: backslant. The delicacy of your serifs helps. But do consider putting slight swells* on the other sides of the semi-serifs, especially in the display cuts. <BR> <BR>* But definitely not mushy ones like in Avance. Look at FF Profile, or maybe Proforma. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

The real problem is two-fold: <BR>1) Bouma decipherability relies heavily on the overall width of the silhouette, and narrowness causes a decrease in the absolute difference of width in the lexicon of boumas. In the parafovea, the best way to tell apart &quot;dearly&quot; and &quot;dastardly&quot; for example is through their width primarily (and the second &quot;d&quot;'s ascender secondarily). <BR>2) Too much narrowness also puts a given bouma too far outside familiarity. <BR> <BR>BTW, do you think Patria is wide or narrow? <BR>You might be surprised that it's more economical than Times&hellip; The trick is the massive counters.

Roman relies in large part    <BR>on the baseline for stability and balance. You can call that static    <BR>equilibrium. Italics, on the other hand, has a sort of &quot;dynamic    <BR>equilibrium&quot; (isn't this perhaps the most important difference between    <BR>them?), even though it's of course also sitting on a virtual baseline.    <BR>When you have a &quot;flat-foot&quot; (roman) half-serif it seems as if the glyph's    <BR>center of gravity isn't quite supported by the base and it tends to fall.    <BR>The same effect doesn't happen in a &quot;carolingian&quot; half-serif as the base    <BR>is not what supports it to begin with. Also the serifs angle provide a  <BR>sort of southwest-northeast thrust to the stems that helps to keep   <BR>them afloat.    <BR>   <BR>BTW, this kind of investigation was one of my interests here.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; what kind of lethargy? <BR> <BR>In this case, the kind that says that only the conventional serif structure works for text, and/or anything between a full-serif and a sans can never be serious. In reality though, serifs are not &quot;appendages&quot;, they are very much structural elements (scary but true), so the presence/absense of a give serif (or half-serif) needs to derive from readability, not how dead people used the pen, or how your teacher taught you to draw pretty fonts. <BR> <BR>In another case, the kind that says that the bowls of the &quot;bdpq&quot; must have the same structure - while the truth (as far as text faces are concerned) is exactly the opposite. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
