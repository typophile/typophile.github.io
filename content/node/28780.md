  and my agency has designed a logo and a visual profile. The logo consists of latin
  letters with the letter \xABI\xBB turned into an exclamation mark symbolizing Grieg's
  own voice; his musical and ideological message.\r\n\r\nThe logo will be used by
  Royal Norwegian Embassies worldwide. The Norwegian embassy of Japan has requested
  a Japanese version of the logo, but I am not sure how to make one.\r\n\r\nDo you
  think they mean a logo using Japanese letters? Is it possible to still use the exclamation
  mark as a part of the logo?\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are someone
  out there who can help me. I will be very grateful if somebody could give me some
  advices.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.grieg07.com\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\nPer\r\nBergen, Norway"

    due to the sound-poor nature of the Japanese syllabary, you will get something
    to the extent of \"GU RI \u2014 GU\". The exclamation point is recognized but
    not standard Japanese punctuation. You can use it, but I don't think it can be
    incorporated a sone of the letters. I could be mistaken, as I'm out of practice
    with Katakana."

    reading (\u30B0\u30EA\u30FC\u30B0) in smaller type.  Perhaps above the name, to
    balance the 2007.  The combination of Latin logo with subsidiary Japanese reading
    seems to be fairly common in Japanese design.\r\n\r\n(The exclamation mark is
    perfectly standard punctuation in modern Japanese, but there isn't an obvious
    place to incorporate it in the kana. I doubt they want the logo completely redone
    in Japanese, though.)"

      so that people would know how to pronounce it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps something like
      the attachment.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jGriegLogo_4159.gif]"
