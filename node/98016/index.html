  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;d like to know the background from the typefaces used in (hand engraved) music scores.  I have looked at the text faces for  setting titles, lyrics, tempi and dynamics.  Music symbols is another interesting subject, since there is a great decline in typographical standards when comparing computer scores to traditional scores.  There is no digital music symbol font that I know of that has attention to all the details that you would find in an engraved score.</p>
<p>Fortunately I have a large library of musical scores, most of which are still hand engraved (from dover publications, many edition peters, etc&hellip;).  Since music engraving had reached most of it&rsquo;s form in the 19th century, I found that the typefaces used were mostly modern (neo-classical).  Titles are mostly modern (display) faces, but other faces, including slab serif are also used.  For lyrics also the modern face was often used, but not exclusively.  I&rsquo;ve found that tempo markings are exclusively set in bold modern, and dynamics in italic modern.</p>
<p>When I looked through &ldquo;typefaces for books&rdquo;, I found that the font the resembles these the most are modern scotch, rather than the bodoni and didot.  The italics look rounder and also the roman t ends in an upwards shape.  I have many books, reprinted from old editions that use this font (Forsyth Orchestration, Harry Olson music physics and engineering, Raleigh the theory of sound).  Also Donald Knuth&rsquo;s Computer Modern Roman was based on this design.</p>
<p>I would like to know what is the history behind these faces.  &ldquo;Typefaces for books&rdquo; describes the design as &ldquo;late transitional&rdquo;, rather than modern, although they are mostly described as modern.  They do not seem to be based on Didot or Bodoni.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Traditionally, the indications like &ldquo;piano&rdquo;, &ldquo;allegro&rdquo;, etc. use some kind of late neo-classical design in italics, like Monotype Modern for example. But, as you say, these were mostly engraved (or lithographed), so these are not typefaces <cite>per se</cite>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If they are engraved, wouldn&rsquo;t they be called <em>typefaces</em>?  Still I have found similar typefaces in many other books, they seem quite standard for the time.  These <em>italic</em> typefaces very much resemble the early scotch modern type, for example the italic fonts made by William Miller (according to [[http://typefoundry.blogspot.be/2007/02/scotch-roman.html|this article]]).  Does that mean that these <em>late neo-classical</em> fonts are based on the english modern type?  Also, has William Miller invented the fonts, or based the design on predecessors?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In the 20th century, a lot of commercial scores of popular music simply had the lyrics typed in - using an IBM Executive typewriter, so that they would almost look printed - usually with the Documentary typestyle.</p>
<p>It was a cheap way to do what would have been very expensive to do with conventional typography, to align each syllable below the appropriate note, and it was well-suited to offset lithograpy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure somebody would also have used the Vari-Typer for this (although the chief musical use I remember is the round paper stickers in the middle of LPs) as well. And no doubt others splurged on a Selectric Composer. But the Executive was very widespread.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">You can definitely call these engraved (or lithographed) <cite>lettering</cite> based on typefaces designs. Richard Austin cut the punches for the types sold by the Miller typefoundry in Glasgow — his designs owe something to those of Baskerville, and are typical of a very specific brand of British neo-classical type style, less severe than the continental one (Didot, Bodoni, Walbaum). See also related designs such as Bell or Bulmer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, I didn&rsquo;t know about the vari-typer!  But since this is a 20th century invention, 19th century engravers still had to punch each letter, right?  What about henle, who did metal plate engraving until the 90&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Regarding Baskerville, Bell, etc, the italic does look mostly like the scotch modern italic, with exceptions: for example the lowercase p has a rounded tail in scotch modern.  That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s in most scores, even early ones (from 1830).</p>
