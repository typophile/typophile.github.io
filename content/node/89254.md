  a good look for \"GREY' I came across a website from the Advertising company of
  the same name. Their Chilean site has the most remarkable look and logo and I really
  want mine to reflect this without infringing on copyright issues.\r\n\r\nPlease
  check our www.liquidgrey.cl and let me know if you recognize the font and color
  etc... Also if you have suggestions on how I can keep this serious and sexy look
  while changing the details (slightly different font, color etc...). Also, do you
  think this would look good in print (business cards, letterheads etc...)\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nTina Grey "

    in their Work/Folio) against a full screen background of gradient gray tones and
    type (especially in the Mr. Lee Flash). In short it is done to create a sense
    of drama.\r\n\r\nI assume the overlay of the full screen techy pixel grid adds
    a sense of logical order and acts as a separation/screen between the background
    of Flash imagery and foreground of text blocks n' stuff to 'sit' on.\r\n\r\nThe
    techy pixel grid is a graphic design widely used throughout the internet (especially
    in the late '90s lol), and so too are the images desaturated and adjusted through
    various Adobe Level, Curves, and some Filters (such as Gaussian Blur) for the
    Flash sequences. And, the compositional technique of dominant gray tones with
    splashes of colour ain't nothing new or proprietary either. The techniques of
    lesser sized graphic elements overlaid upon full screen Flash is nothing new either.\r\n\r\nI
    use the same compositional techniques on my tumblr: graphicdeclaration.tumblr.com
    - except I used a reverse dynamic relationship. I have lesser sized colourful
    imagery moving over a full screen static background of gray tones ...the techy
    grid would be out of place, but having said that the frames in which the images
    rest is something of a grid in itself. And perhaps that is where you might experiment
    also...\r\n\r\nSorry I don't know that typeface - others here surely might. You
    can bet your sweet ampersand on that :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would generally advise against mimicking the look of another company that
    also shares the same name. Copyright is one thing, confusing people (as to what's
    separate companies and what's supposed to belong together) is another.

    infringing on copyright issues\r\n\r\nTina, it's common for designers to be inspired
    by the work of others, but you need to develop your own identity, not simply imitate
    someone else's logo and site design with minimal changes to avoid legal issues.
    Especially since your company name is similar.  "
