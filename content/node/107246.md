  body: "Let's look more closely at Kyrial. Top line is Kyrial Sans with lower case
    a modified to have a tail like Kyrial Display. Second line is Kyrial Sans. Third
    line is Kyrial Display.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kyrial_4112.jpg]\r\nThe
    differences between modified Kyrial and the specimen image are almost imperceptible.\r\nDon"

  body: "@donshottype I really appreciate your analysis. But even the modified Kyrial
    Display still has some differences from the specimen image. The leg from \"R\"
    is not curved, as Kyrial. Also, the terminals are slightly different. See new
    specimen image comparison.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_comparison_3595.jpg]\r\n\r\nbut
    again, thanks a lot!"

  body: "Congratulations Akira on finding Matterhorn.\r\nJust to clear up one point
    about Kyrial, I was NOT proposing that Kyrial display was the right typeface,
    I was proposing the modified Kyrial SANS [the top row] as the candidate. It does
    not have the curving bottom terminals on u and d. Leg on R seems straight. But
    I do not dispute your observation on the top terminals of a and s. So it's still
    not a match.\r\nI hope you can find a way to get a legitimate copy of Matterhorn.\r\nDon"

  body: I knew Akira would find this one! Congratulations, that looked too hard for
    me! I really thought it could have been a mixed of Kyrial Display and Sans (awfully
    close to Matterholn BTW) which, now I see the answer, looks to be the only solution,
    Matterholn being an exclusive typeface for Disney so most probably not available
    for licensing.
