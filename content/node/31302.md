    then simply go through the combination that need kerning and adjust them - Ta,
    Tc, Td, Te etc.\r\n\r\nc. "

  body: "Richard, you might consider learning this stuff in FontLab instead. \r\n\r\nThe
    reason is that there is a considerable investment of time learning either program.
    If you already are comfortable in Fontographer, then there is less reason to switch.
    But if you have to learn a lot in either program, then it makes sense to me to
    start in FontLab, as it is the full featured program, and you are likely to have
    to end up using it anyway. \r\n\r\nAt any rate, that was my reasoning and what
    I have done."

    thread and keep it in a text editing program. Then you can copy and paste into
    the metrics window of your chosen font editing program to save yourself a lot
