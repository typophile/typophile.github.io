  Elements of Typographic style</em> by Robert Bringhurst\r\n<em>Thinking with Type</em>
  by Ellen Lupton\r\n<em>Stop Stealing Sheep and Find out how Type Works</em> by Erik
  Spiekermann and E.M Ginger\r\n\r\nWhat books would you recommend to add to this?
  Give a little review if you can.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nEvan\r\n<a href=\"http://evanmade.com\"

  body: "That is quite the list -- a bit overwhelming. What of those books have you
    read and what do you think? Why do you like them? For whom would you recommend
    them (i.e. type designers, graphic designers, editors, web developers, and so
    on)?\r\n\r\nevan\r\n<a href=\"http://evanmade.com\">www.evanmade.com</a>"

  body: "Here are some links to book reviews:\r\n\r\nTypophile has a <strong>Books</strong>
    section which includes some reviews by fellow Typophiles... You can find it by
    going to the RESOURCES link at the top of this page, or by clicking <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/books\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe
    Type Directors Club has a <a href=\"http://www.tdc.org/reviews/index.html\"><strong>Reviews</strong></a>
    section on its website.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.typebooks.org/\"><strong>TypeBooks</strong></a>
    website hasn't been updated since 2002, but that doesn't mean you won't find useful
    reviews there. :-)\r\n\r\nHappy reading!\r\n\r\nP.S. And speaking of Jost Hochuli,
    the English translation of his <em>Detail in typography</em> is finally available
    from <a href=\"http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/\">Hyphen</a>...\r\n"
