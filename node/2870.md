body: Hello all, <BR> <BR>My first post on this board dealt with a font I&#39;ve been
  hunting for a long, long time. It was a serif italic with characteristic swooping
  serifs used in the televison and print ads for the De Beers company&#39;s &#34;Shadows&#34;
  campaign starting in 1996. Since then I&#39;ve been trying to find out what it was.
  I even tried contacting the Ad agency that produced the ads, J. Walter Thompson
  in London, but ended up where I began. Read my original post here <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/10604.html"
  target="_blank">here</a> <BR> <BR><b>A quick summary of the story until now:</b>
  <BR><i>It may be a Caslon!</i> <BR>My searched seemed futile until I came across
  Elsner and Flake&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/caslon-rough/hef-regular-italic/testdrive.html?s=How%2Belse%2Bcould%2Btwo%2Bmonths%2Bsalary%2Blast%2Bforever&amp;p=48&#62;"
  target="_blank">Caslon Rough</a> which bears an unequivocal resemblance to my mystery
  font. If it weren&#39;t for the roughened appearance it would be almost perfect
  &#40;The &#39;v&#39; is different but that&#39;s inconsequential to me&#41;. It
  turns out that Elsner and Flake&#39;s Caslon Rough was based on a phototype Caslon
  from the 1980s of ATF origin, according to Ms. Elsner.   <BR> <BR>Since we have
  some phototype experts here, I was hoping we could shed some new light on this mystery.
  Any help would be very greatly appreciated.  <BR> <BR>See  <a href="http://www.sugarbuzz.net/diamond.jpg"

  is also attached to the bottom of this message.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25072.jpg"

  body: 'I hope this doesn&#39;t duplicate something already being worked on by someone
    else, but I did a number of hunts. First, I looked the McGrew&#39;s &#39;American
    Metal Typefaces&#39; for Caslons. There is only one that has a v even vaguely
    like the original DeBeers type and that is a Monotype version that no longer seems
    to exist. Caslon 540 seems the most like the sample. I used the MyFonts test drive
    and a couple of fonts I have on hand to build the follwoing sample sheet for comparison
    to the posted sample: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25079.gif"
    alt="Caslon Italic Samples"> <BR>It seems that none of these has the rounded serif
    you emphasized, and this suggests to me that the work was a customized version
    of Caslon 540. Someone with more skill than I have could even do something as
    crude as convert the font to outlines and round out the corners &#40;I thought
    about trying it, but I have other things to do -- sorry&#41;.  Probaly a heavier
    weight than the ones I used might also look closer to the original.  <BR> <BR>My
    question is a pragmatic one &#40;heretical though it may be in this group&#41;
    -- how much does the serif on the d matter to you? Do you think even one person
    out of 100 would notice if you reproduced the phrase with an existing Caslon Italic
    of the right weight and spacing? Without them being side-by-side, I doubt if I
    would notice the difference. &#40;Can I keep coming here, even after uttering
    such an outrage?&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, I did look in my Photo-Lettering book and
    there are a raft of Caslon italics, but no complete enough samples to say that
    any of them might have been used. Most did not look very close. I think De Beers
    could afford to have a customized typeface designed for their ads. '

  body: Thanks for your help guys! <BR> <BR>I heartily agree that the y was modified
    in the De Beers font, but this is likely the <b>only</b> modification that was
    made to the font. In my opinion it is definetly <b>not</b> a modification of Caslon
    540 but rather it&#39;s own version of Caslon &#40;see images below&#41;. The
    evidence is that Caslon Rough is 99% the De Beers font. They couldn&#39;t both
    be coincidently modified Caslon 540s and look that much alike.  <BR> <BR>If I
    find the source of Caslon Rough, I&#39;ve found my diamond font. I dont&#39; care
    about he curly &#39;v&#39;. If J. Walter Thompson got hold of it and modified
    it, and Elsner and Flake got hold of it separately, and roughened it, it has to
    be around somewhere.   <BR> <BR>And yes, Mike, this font is my white whale. I
    must have the swooping rounded serifs. It&#39;s become more than a font but rather
    a journey <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: It&#39;s very odd. I went to the EF site and examined Caslon Rough more closely.
    I&#39;m unable to find any version of Caslon--metal, photo, digital, whatever--that
    resembles it. I also find it odd that they would have said it was based on a &#34;phototype
    Caslon from the 1980s of ATF origin.&#34; As far as I know very few phototype
    fonts were created in the 1980s--everything was going digital by then. ATFs Caslons
    are easy to find, but none that I looked at are even close to EF&#39;s. And I
    don&#39;t think ATF would be doing new designs in the 1980s &#40;if that&#39;s
    what was meant&#41;.

    would make more sense if the ATF origin was the 1890&#39;s, although I&#39;m a
    bit surprised that you say there wasn&#39;t much photo type being developed in
    the 80&#39;s. I just bought a book from 1980 by the esteemed Allan Haley &#40;now
    of Agfa-Monotype&#41; called &#34;Phototypography&#34; in which there is no clue
    that the digital font era was anywhere in sight. I realize that  might have quickly
    changed, but I would still expect something to have been going on at least into
    the mid 80&#39;s. That&#39;s around the time when Phil&#39;s Photo and Solotype
    were reaching their peaks, isn&#39;t it?  <BR> <BR>

  body: 'I went back into my library and looked through the Caslon samples in my 1936
    Linotype catalog. Caslon Old Face seems to have some of the characteristics that
    are closer to your Caslon Rough. The only digital version of it I could find was
    Bitstream&#39;s. The serifs angle upwards a bit more, although the corner is still
    not as rounded.  These were done with Test Drive samples: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25160.gif"

  body: Yes, there was still phototype in the eighties. But digital was rapidly making
    inroads in the very early eighties. A publisher I was working for got a Linotron
    202 system about 1981. It was CRT-based, but digital nonetheless. My recollection
    is that the systems for setting headline type--mainly the VGC Typositor--were
    being undermined by ever-higher-quality automatic typesetting systems, especially
    digital ones. I&#39;d have to look at my back-issues of U&amp;lc, but I think
    outfits like VGC were also losing touch with designers&#39; sensibilities and
    releasing increasingly irrelevant faces. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I&#39;m rambling here.
    I would love to know more about the source of EF&#39;s Caslon. Caslon, in all
    its various incarnations, is a longtime favorite of mine. Theirs is one of the
    more unusual ones I&#39;ve seen.

    last typeface, Americana, in 1965. I have ATF catalogs from 1941 and 1955.

    <BR>The MyFonts profile on ATF says they were acquired by Kinglsy in 1986 and
    that combination went defunct in 1993. <BR> <BR>Never mind...  Sorry for the misiniformation.
    I will check multiple sources in the future.

  body: I just looked over my information from Ms. Elsner, and it seems that Caslon
    Rough was created in the 1980s &#40;when exactly she didn&#39;t specify&#41; for
    a German company who delivered the ATF phototype originals. I hope this clarifies
    things a bit. Rereading it now, my original message in this post doesn&#39;t make
    that clear. Sorry. That&#39;s about all the information I have.  <BR> <BR>Mike,
    Caslon Old Face looks terribly close. Thanks for that. I should probably place
    it on my wanted list. <BR> <BR>I only wish I knew what the name of that original
    phototype font was. Sigh. The road goes ever on ... <BR>

  body: The thing that confuses me is your phrase &#34;ATF phototype originals.&#34;
    As far as I know, ATF only did metal foundry type for hand setting. Nearly all
    of their fonts were done later as phototype and still later as digital type, but
    not by them &#40;if you don&#39;t count the few that Kingsley issued in PostScript
    around 1990--I don&#39;t&#41;. You do mean ATF as in American Type Founders, right?
