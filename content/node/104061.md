  body text typeface(s) or font(s) to use to for a web ad to advertise a business
  on Acupuncture Today online:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/home.php\r\n\r\nIt's
  an ad to incentivize Acupuncturists to click on it for a free marketing session.
  I'm looking for faces that are bold and or interesting enough that they get attention
  but not so much that they stick out like a sore thumb or look obnoxious on what
  is a fairly relaxed feeling website. Anything that has a an Asian flair,  and or
  sense of growth (Grow may be one of the words in the ad) or healing would be great
  as well. They also have to be readable at a very small size because the ad is 125
  px x 125 px. \r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions!\r\n\r\n"
