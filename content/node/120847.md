body: "I am editing an existing font family that had proportional old style figures
  as the default and a feature for tabular lining. My client wants those switched
  so that tabular lining is the default and proportional old style the feature.\r\n\r\nSeems
  simple\u2026 I set up a new encoding file with figure.oldstyle replacing the old
  figure.lnum glyphs and, copied the glyphs into the new locations and set up the
  features to work properly.\r\n\r\nThat just leaves the kerning\u2026 right now I
  am laboriously copying the kerning info onto paper, deleting it all then carefully
  inputting it all back into the new old style glyphs. It seems like this approach
  will take forever with 16 individual fonts and is prone to accidental mistakes.\r\n\r\nI
  couldn't get \"Paste Special\" to work as all the figures have new names. Can you
  guys think of an easier way to handle this kerning problem? \r\n\r\n"

  body: "That is brilliant, Malcolm! I have worked with Fontlab for a few years and
    never thought to try editing amf files with a text editor. This bit of information
    will come in very handy down the road.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "As brilliant as it sounded, I can not get this process to work.\r\n\r\nI
    have edited the old afm file in Word and TextEdit (mac). I just changed all the
    figure names from zero to zero.oldstyle throughout. The new font has all the figures
    in position and renamed in the encoding file. \r\n\r\nWhen I import the new afm
    back into the new font with the new figure names, it only applies changes to glyphs
    that were in the original font. Any glyph with a new name get no new kerning.\r\n\r\nAny
    ideas on what might be happening?"

  body: "It was great to learn I can edit .afm in a text editor. Disappointing that
    search and replace would not work as described\u2026\r\n\r\nI think it had something
    to do with the new figures being in the wrong order after their names were changed.
    The Update [kern] feature would not reorder them properly to work either.\r\n\r\nThe
    most streamlined workflow I could figure out was to export the old .afm, open
    it in a text editor and do searches for the figures. As I found them, I cut them
    from the old .afm and pasted them into a new blank doc.\r\n\r\nI imported the
    .afm, now with no figure info, into my new .vfb with the new the figures with
    new names and positions.\r\n\r\nUsing the new text file with all figure info,
    I copied and pasted the data into the new figures by hand.\r\n\r\nA little tedious
    but it worked. I am still thinking there is probably a better way..."

  body: I do quite a bit of website coding that often involves conditional search
    and replace patterns that extend over hundreds of documents. For these kinds of
    complex changes to text, learning Regular Expressions can literally save thousands
    of hours of manual deletes, copying, pasting, reordering and adding things. Combine
    it with a scripting language, like Perl or, even, Applescript and magical sorts
    of mass changes can be done. The big drawback, of course, is the learning curve,
    which probably wouldn't be cost-effective for a one-off juggling of text in a
    few .afm files.
