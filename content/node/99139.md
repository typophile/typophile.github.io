  body: "Not \"Typewriter\" like, but like a Dymo Labelmaker. One possibility is [[http://www.fontspace.com/tension-type/impact-label|Impact
    Label]]. Others include [[http://www.azfonts.net/load_font/c14-blacktape.html|Carbon
    14]],  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/dimeotype/|Dimeotype]], LabelGunTape,
    and Punch Label. There are others, such as DYMO (dafont.com) that don't have the
    distinctive serif'ed /I in your sample.\r\n\r\n- Herb"
