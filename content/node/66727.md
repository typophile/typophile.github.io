  On iPad Eve I feel, as book designer, editor and typographer, much the same excitement
  that came with the introduction of quality paperbacks in the 1950s. Our book culture
  cannot without mediation just be republished in new media. All our typographical
  skills are needed to make the tablets function in a humane and literate way and
  thereby assist the survival of the book. '
