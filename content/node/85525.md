  body: It looks quite similar to Neuropol [X], but the stroke endings aren't rounded

  body: "It must be Neuropolitical - (c) 1999 by Ray Larabie\r\n\r\nI see that Ray
    Larabie (Typodermic) has also designed Neuropol [X],\r\nso I suppose Neuropolitical
    could be an earlier version of Neuropol [X]\r\nwith square endings.\r\n\r\nFivos\r\nPS:
    I found it using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com"
