  body: "This is a repost of a comment I added to the thread mentioned above:\r\n\r\nThose
    of you interested in space and type will be glad to know about a book I packaged
    and produced for The MIT Press, to be released in a couple of weeks. It\u2019s
    called:\r\n\r\nMarketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program\r\nby
    David Meerman Scott and Richard Jurek\r\nwith a foreword by Captain Eugene A.
    Cernan--the last man to walk on the Moon\r\n[[http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/marketing-moon]]\r\n[[http://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Moon-Selling-Apollo-Program/dp/0262026961]]\r\n[[http://www.marketingthemoon.com]]\r\n\r\nIt
    contains some three hundred period images, including all kinds of advertising
    and PR material, as well as some key documents that have never been seen before.
    One item of direct relevance to this thread is a handwritten note showing the
    relationship of Kubrick and Clarke and Julian Scheer, the head of the NASA Public
    Affairs Office at the time 2001 was in the works, as well as the relationship
    of some others involved with both NASA operations and the film.\r\n\r\nFor those
    of you who are interested in period typographic analysis, it\u2019s a gold mine
    of graphics related to the space program, all very well reproduced (if I say so,
    myself). I consciously avoided using space-program era types in the design of
    the book, which I thought would be gilding the lily, considering the illustrations.\r\n\r\nYou
    won\u2019t be disappointed!\r\n"
