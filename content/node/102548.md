body: "I'm hoping to get some suggestions for type faces corresponding to the art
  movements of surrealism and abstract expressionism. This is to be a web-based project,
  so faces available in webfont form would be ideal and I'm looking to find practical
  options suitable for display and body text. Thus, I'm not looking for anything too
  over-the-top (specifically with respect to surrealism) but more from the standpoint
  of type faces that fit the periods-- i.e. early 20s-30s for surrealism and 40s-60s
  for abstract expressionism-- and contain subtle character, indicating sensitivity
  to the style/ethos of the artwork, along with strong readability. The former movement
  would be predominantly European with respect to applicable faces, whereas the latter
  could be a mixture of European and American influences.\r\n\r\nThanks very much
  for any general feedback; I'd love to hear of any favorites you may have that suit
  the respective periods."
