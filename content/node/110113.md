  in use in the printed version of The Times newspaper in the UK.\r\n\r\nI know I
  probably should've already heard of this and I did read an article about the redesign
  not too long ago but now I can't seem to find out what they are, and to top it off
  searching for it elsewhere proved a fruitless effort as the only thing that would
  ever come up is Times New Roman. I know it's a stupid question but help me out here?\r\n\r\nthank
  you :-)"

    market) called '[[http://www.researchstudios.com/2010/07/29/research-the-times|Times
    Modern]]' by Research Studios under the Art Direction of its founder Neville Brody.\r\n2
    nice alternatives and commercially available would be [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/acta|Acta]]
    family by Dino dos Santos and [[https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/publico|Publico]]
    by Christian Schwartz and Kai Bernau for Commercial Type (originally created for
    the Lisbon newspaper 'P\xFAblico')."
