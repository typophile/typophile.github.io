  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello again, everyone. I'm designing my resume, and I'd appreciate some input about serif/sans serif font choices.

The impression I want to give: warm, yet distinguished. Nothing cold or sterile. 

My ideas so far: 

1. Dolly paired with Auto (or Formata?)
2. Freight Text Medium paired with Freight Sans

I'm leaning toward using Dolly, at least. I'd love to see just how much mileage I can get out of that beauty, but I'm open to all suggestions.

Thanks.

Freight is a nice typeface but not soft and warm enough I think.

Yes, Dolly and Auto are a wonderful pair after all. My only problem was that the bold weight of Auto was rather overpowering (for subheads), so I simply increased the point size of the reqgular weight and made everything flush-left for more uniformity. Made a world of difference.

I was chastised by a recruiter for using Times New Roman for my resume in an application for a design position. I would have agreed with him except my only option for submitting for the position was in in a Word format. I guess I could have used Arial?</div>

That story is quite funny, but since everyone was applying through Word docs, the recruiters most likely knew this and were trying to catch a designer off beat.  (file under: testing skills through curveballs)</div>

I'm sure the humour of this isn't lost on you: you used TNR on a resume for a *design* position. In any case, Arial would probably have been an even worse choice. At least TNR is an original, though drawing from a tradition which includes Plantin, I believe. Arial, however, is a poorly-executed knockoff of Helvetica and is universally hated in the design world.

I've never applied for a design position - it isn't my field, although I feel that nearly all written matter should be "designed" to some degree. Just good typography. I suspeect that you'd be better off investing in some quality fonts from houses such as, say, Underware, Porchez Typefonderie, etc. StormType is another producer of great fonts that can cover all your needs quite easily.</div>

Due to the fact that many places want to receive resumes in Microsoft Word format, I opted for Georgia for headers and Verdana for body copy. Looks pretty good on any computer.

Any thoughts?

Speaking of curveballs, even though the job description said they were looking for a "Sr. graphic Artist," they were really looking for someone who could hit the ground running as a C++ programmer. It was a very strange experience talking to the recuiter. Needless to say I was a bit underqualified for the position.

		<div class="commentbody">Consider telling us what kind of position you're applying for. No typeface is suitable for every industry.

If you're looking for warm and distinguished, consider Galliard. It is familiar to the reader, yet in another league, and the italic is individual.

Arrus is also a good choice, graceful and warm.
