    even though it isn't an exact match.\r\n\r\nYour image looks like it's inspired
    by an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erector_set\">Erector set</a>!\r\n\r\nHowever,
    a little digging revealed that this is <a href=\"http://www.proa.org/news.php?id=261\">a
    custom job for Fundaci\xF3n Proa</a>, of Buenos Aires. Proa's website has <a href=\"http://proa.org/eng/news/2008/12/interview-with-tony-brook/\">an
    interview with Tony Brook</a>, Creative Director of British design studio <a href=\"http://www.spin.co.uk/\">Spin</a>,
