body: "Hey all!\r\n\r\nI need some help getting the typography right for a logo I'm
  developing for our fictional studio, called (Buro) ODD. With our choice of name
  we basically wanted to give ourselves some freedom, which works because we've got
  a lot of odd stuff planned for our audiovisual and webdesign productions... like
  using cornstarch and recycled paper for letterheads.\r\n\r\nBeing the typographic
  newbie that I am, I'm struggling with the typography. On the one hand I want to
  create something that is ODD, fresh and a tad artistic. On the other, I don't want
  to communicate that we're a messy bunch.\r\n\r\nSo far, here's what I've been focusing
  on. Any comments and tips are appreciated. While the basic form won't change drastically
  anymore (we're really comfortable with this), crits are always welcome. The logo
  might get a color, but I've uploaded it B&W for now.\r\n\r\nedit: also uploaded
  more version from teammembers.\r\n\r\nedit2: seems like the old uploads were moved,
  thus their url not working. uploaded the same plus extra.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I wouldn't mess type. The main image is already odd (one too many fingers),
    you don't have to do the same with type. Make all three letters from the same
    typeface, as long as it's not the geometric one that's used for the second D.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    play with negative space if you want to make it more stable and professional.
    Put a negative hand in a square and also include type inside the square under
    the hand. Having this hand alone makes it a bit scary and... well odd.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
