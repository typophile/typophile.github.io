  need to find two fonts (one serif, one sans) that go well together, are a bit edgy
  and will also not date within the next five years. \r\nI would be most grateful
  if anyone could recommend anything that they think would work well. \r\nThe fonts
  also need to have a foundry so that my boss will think he's getting his money's
  worth!"

    cover?\r\n\"The fonts also need to have a foundry.\" Can you explain this?"

  body: "Hi,\r\nI've just been working on a homes mag last week.\r\nIf your looking
    for new different fonts look at Visi magazine from South Africa. They use individual
    fonts for each feature and the magazine is award winning. Could you also tell
    me what sort of homes stuff, what market it is. Is it: softer warm inviting or
    more hard edge cutting edge modern design futuristic.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nDan"

  body: I'm also in the midst of a magazine re-design, although it's slightly different
    content. It's a small offroad racing publication. I'm going through different
    typefaces right now for body and display situations. I'll definitely stay tuned
    to see what you guys come up with and share my own thoughts as well.

  body: "Please do avoid avand garde which is a horrible cliche for an architecture-design
    magazine.\r\n\r\nNeutral and very clean Sans Serifs tend to be a bad choice for
    magazines as well because they lack character, they look too bland and generic.
    Faces such as The Sans, Frutiger or Syntax fit the category.\r\n\r\nI think that
    you can choose a sturdy and common body face as long as you use it on an edgy
    way instead of torturing the reader with a funky copy face.\r\n\r\nMaybe FF Bau
    as a reference to Helvetica and Atma for copy. Maybe it's too safe and you want
    something more edgy. I tought also of FF Bastille. \r\n\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    for a magazine and I love it.\r\n\r\nNot sure it will work for you though. your
    column width, text size, story length, reader's tastes all need to be considered
    before you choose.\r\n\r\nDoing some tests setting text on a sample page with
    your mag's column widths may help you decide what looks best at the point size
    you need it."

  body: "Thankyou everyone for your helpful replies. \r\nFonts have never been a strength
    of mine as a designer, but i am certainly learning a lot. \r\n\r\nFoundry must
    be the wrong word to use.\r\nI meant like a family. \r\nI am loving the fonts
    that have a lot of variations, eg. extra light, light, regular, medium, bold,
    heavy, ultra etc. \r\n\r\nThese are the fonts I am looking at using:\r\n\r\nGotham
    for a sans serif\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008\r\n\r\nand
    Chronicle for the serif\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100032\r\n\r\nThough
    they are pretty expensive, i think they're very elegant and versatile. \r\nI would
    like to hear other people's opinions as well. \r\n\r\nI will also look into the
    suggestions everyone has made. \r\n\r\nAlso, apologies for my late post, i have
    been out for two days with the flu.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "By the way here is some information about the magazine, which may help explain
    my choices/criteria...\r\n\r\n-It has been around for five years and is well respected
    by the building and design industry. \r\n-Though we steer clear of advertorial,
    we often write about the advertising clients and most of the content is state
    based. \r\n-It is directed towards an affluent market. \r\n\r\nSo in other words,
    there is a certain expectation and people to please. We have to look contemporary
    and design forward, but can't be too challenging or out there. "
