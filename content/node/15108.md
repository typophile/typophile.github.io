  body: Looks great, and I don't mean to look a gift horse in the mouth, but please
    tell me there's a PC version with auto-activation coming!

  body: Jason, I suspect that a PC version is in the works. The Mac version has auto-activation,
    and the PC version should most-likely do everything that the Mac does.

  body: "I've installed it and played around with it in my free time. And so far it
    looks very, very promising. The UI & aesthetics are similar to iTunes, so for
    mac users it should be intuitive. One thing that is really cool is there is a
    'store' icon that takes you to Linotype's site, from there you can preview and
    purchase fonts (again, very similar to iTunes). And all the font preview and information
    is customizable within the app.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to get it now, and play
    around with it. It's got me all squishy inside. Tee-hee. - Aron"

    work for a printer and we are working with clients fonts all the time."

  body: so far, I like it a lot better than suitcase. The auto-activation actually
    works...

  body: "Has anyone installed FontExplorer X with Suitcase X1 still on your Mac? We
    have had difficulties with Suitcase here. We have been waiting for there to be
    a stable reliable alternative. Our entire creative team would migrate if it's
    half as good as all of you gents have been writing.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would
    be greatly appreciated."

  body: "The installer detects any other font manager and gives you the option to
    disable it. If you decided not to disable Suitcase when installing FE expect to
    have a lot of problems. It is not FE's fault. Any two font managers running at
    the same time on a system will crash, because there will be two apps trying to
    do the same thing.\r\n\r\nI removed Suitcase X1 from my system and installed FontExplorer
    X, and I am happy with it. It is faster, with more options and more control, and
    does the job better.\r\n\r\nRemember that it is still a beta version, so it will
    have a lot of bugs."

  body: "Bad idea to use FEX with another font manager active. Strange things happen\u2026
    But they also happened after I disabled/removed FontAgentPro. \r\n\r\nI got the
    impression that FEX and Konfabulator don' t like each other, or maybe it's an
    interface font issue.\r\n\r\nNo fun troubleshooting that, so I've gone back to
    FAP.\r\n\r\nBTW There are some usercomments re FEX that indicate that previews
    don't function if more that 3500 fonts are in FEX's database.\r\nAnd I think that
    FEX's missing fonts warnings in Illustrator with its automatic activation of the
    FEX main screen is bad interface. It threw me, completely. But then, maybe I should
    have RTFM\u2026"
