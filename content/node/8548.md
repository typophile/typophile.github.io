    more graphic than typo when I went to the graduation show a couple of years ago.

  body: ' Hello Ruben, I&#39;m not a expert about your question but I know that our
    compatriot Jorge dos Reis studyed at Royal college of Art, Clerkenwell and the
    Norwich Scholl of Art in London. Try to get the links of this schools and good
    luck for the informations. For your unhappiness we don&#39;t have a graduation
    or a post graduate in typography Design, in my case I have been learning alone
    and make some contacts and feed-backs here with the typophile community. I think
    we must join forces to get a strong typography environmment in our country!. See
    you soon and best Regards from your typography neightbour. <BR> <BR>Um abra&ccedil;o

    <BR> <BR>The only art/design college I know of in Clerkenwell is the LCP site
    at Back Hill, referenced above. <BR> <BR>I would imagine that the &#34;Norwich
    School of Art&#34; is in fact in Norwich, about 100 miles from London. <BR> <BR><A

  body: Although I was actually a part of the &#39;historical&#39; MA at Reading,
    I did observe and participate in some of the Type Design MA seminars/lectures.
    I would highly recommend this to anyone serious about learning about type design.
