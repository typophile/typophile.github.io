  body: '[Help Needed] I need to replicate this font for Library signage, but need
    a better idea of what it is or at the very least, what family it is close too
    so that I can try to manipulate something similar. -- Thank you!'

  body: "Baskerville has a 4 with an upward-pointing serif on the crossbar, but it
    isn't squared-off and perpendicular to the crossbar, as on your sample, but tapers
    to a smaller point and is angled to the right.\r\n\r\nI'd go to www.myfonts.com
    and type \"Baskerville\" into the search field, type \"40\" into the sample text
    field once the search results come up, and scroll through until you see something
    you like (check \"Fit to Width\" in the sample bar to get a large preview). \r\n\r\nGood
    luck with your recreation."

  body: "These are hand made and not based on a specific font.\r\nBaskerfille, already
    suggested by Kevin, has the uptick but the letterforms do not match -- the cross
    stoke on _4_ is too high and _0_ is too wide [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BaskervilleMT_40_3651.gif]\r\nAs
    close to the letterforms that I could find is: Velino Compressed Text Book\r\n
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/VelinoCompressedTextBook_40_3804.gif] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/velino-compressed-text/
    Just add the uptick and you have a fair match.\r\nRunner up: Consort RR Light
    Condensed \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ConsortRRLightCondensed_40_3866.gif]
