  body: "It's sort of pseudo-[[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=artsandcrafts|Arts
    & Crafts]] style, but the low E crossbar seems wrong. I think Lex is right that
    this is a customized font, maybe a freebie at some site.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I noticed the similarities to Gill Sans as well, so thought it was customised,
    but this is from an English Students' Union, not an organisation that would have
    put that much thought into it (they don't even have a vector version of it, only
    JPEGs) ... so I'm going to go with a freebie font at a site they found.\r\n\r\nI
    think I'll have to re-create it from Gill.\r\n\r\nThanks guys."
