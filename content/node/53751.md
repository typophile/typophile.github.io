  body: "David, there is a fair bit written about this sign already on Typophile.\r\n\r\nYou'll
    find a pretty good insight in this thread.\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/7785]]\r\n\r\nThere'
    also a post about half way down this thread by Stuart Sandler, who seems to know
    a lot about Las Vegas signage.\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/5909]]\r\n\r\nI
    also pulled out this link, which has an interview with Betty Willis, the original
    designer of the sign:\r\n[[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Oct-01-Fri-2004/business/24890843.html|Betty
