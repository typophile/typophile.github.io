  the computer was formatted \r\nand the font file lost. All that remains is this
  picture. I vaguely remember that I found the font in the first\r\nplace looking
  for fonts that resemble the Marshall amplifier brand logo. But i can't seem to find
  the same font\r\nagain...\r\nPlease help."

    But M\xE5ns Greb\xE4ck did draw a typeface based upon the likely hand-lettering
    of the logo. There are free for personal use versions on the typical sites with
    the fuller version being available on MyFonts named, appropriately, Amplify."
