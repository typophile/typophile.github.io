  its inspiration mainly from Theo van Doesburg's De Stijl era lettering. The type
  he designed for the Aubette Caf\xE9, De Stijl Magazine, etc. was used as a starting
  point and then expanded upon. While this typeface was inspired by historical references,
  it also has the ability to invoke a contemporary feel under the right conditions.
  Distill will work hard whether you are designing a neo-constructivist poster or
  a futuristic website. Distill is a family of 12 fonts: 4 weights, each containing
  condensed, regular, and expanded widths. It also features several alternate characters.

  from MADType is a new stencil typeface family. Inspiration for the typeface came
  from both Art Deco and Military sources. It comes with both a clean geometric and
  hand drawn version so you don't have to get carpal tunnel sketching it out yourself.
  This typeface is equally at home stenciled with paint on a wall or used on a music
  poster. \r\nhttp://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0267"
