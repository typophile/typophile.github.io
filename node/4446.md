  consider the term just in a typographic way, <BR>but also, especially, under a linguistic
  &amp; anthropological <BR>point of view. <BR> <BR>Thanks for helping me in my research.

  body: This seems sort of vague. Or maybe it&#39;s that there&#39;s too many of them
    these days to pick out just a few? <BR> <BR>I guess when you say &#34;idiosyncratic&#34;
    you have to explain if you mean with respect to typographic tradition &#40;which
    would mean like most of the Emigre library for example&#41;, or maybe instead
    with respect with the functional needs of type - I&#39;m talking about the need
    for each glyph to fit with all the others in the font. So for example NotCaslon
    would qualify for the first but not the second, since its glyphs are well-integrated.
    <BR> <BR>Dunno... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Just to introduce a bit of me &amp; my question, <BR>I am working on my MA-Thesis
    in Graphic Design: <BR>a typeface based on Ernest Hemingway&#39;s &#34;The Old
    Man &amp; the Sea&#34; style/content. <BR>&#40;An interpretation of&#41; The harsh
    and beautiful relation between literature &amp; typography. <BR>If our field is
    to advance, we must, without displacing creativity and aesthetics, <BR>make sure
    our terminology is clear. <BR>This is nice &amp; useful thing for me to read people&#39;s
    ways of distinguishing the theme.  <BR>Spiekermann&#39;s reply was great. <BR>Right
    now, I&#39;m working sulle minuscole &#40;on the lower cases&#41;; <BR>I&#39;m
    busy now working on the font on computer, I&#39;m using FontLab for the first
    time, <BR>it is a super cool software. I&#39;m gonna put the &#39;IT&#39; contributions
    in my thesis. <BR>IT is also the Internet code for Italy, quite funny. <BR>Thank
    you for the adjective &#34;elaborate&#34;, Yves Peters, that makes me hopeful;
    <BR>smart line mr Nick Shinn; mr Papazian&#39;s, precisely, with respect with
    the functional <BR>needs of type, just merci! <BR>To the next one.'

  body: Perhaps I am looking at it backwards.  I am seeing a type with idiosyncracies.  To
    me, this is a type with quirks, a type with glyphs or parts of glyphs which break
    either the patterrn of form seemingly developed in the rest of the font or even
    different from the &#34;norm&#34; of all typefaces we know. It is like seeing
    a double-take in film

  body: I don&#39;t know. I am thinking along the lines of Nick in regards <BR>to
    the macro/micro nature of a typeface. Some designers most <BR>certainly have idiosyncracies
    that come through in their type <BR>designs. Sometimes not easy to pinpoint, more
    of a feel I think. <BR> <BR>kris.

  body: Mr. Chris Lozos, I appreciate your line -- about &#34;seeing a double-take
    in film,&#34; that you are not quite sure that what you saw was &#34;really&#34;
    what you saw so you look again to confirm it -- because it reminds me to my dominant
    intention, which is to encourage the watcher looking two times. <BR>Thought I`m
    designig a text letter type based on Roman Capital proportions &#40;Uc&#41; &amp;
    Gill Sans&#39; &#40;lc&#41; applied within a sailing-symbolic-grid, hem, yes,
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>,
    well, that is what triggered my question. <BR> <BR>Mr. Kris Sowersby, micro-macro
    fits very well with the biology of the man, his brain, his soul, the ecosystem
    and so on, it is a salient word &#40;concept&#41; quoted there, grazie.
