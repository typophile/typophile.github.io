  isn't much to go on, but I'm trying to find out which font was used for the 'M'
  in this horrible logotype. Apologies!"

  body: "Two separate fonts. Note sharp join of the serif on the lhs, found in relatively
    few fonts, vs. the smooth join on rhs which is found on many. The thick lhs stroke
    for M may help to narrow the selection, assuming it was not added by the logo
    designer. However, without some more letters a single matching font is problematic.
    The white space effect in the lhs is sometimes called \"handtooled\" or \"open
    face.\" It may have been in the original font or added by the logo designer. You
    could try to Google \"fonts  handtooled\" and \"fonts open face\"  and see if
    you like any of the matches. Also check the collection at the <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.fontscape.com/explore?7RK\">Fontscape
    typeface directory of openface serif typefaces</a>. None match but it does give
    an idea of the possible effects for other letters.\r\nPerhaps someone else recognizes
    lhs M as from a font?\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: the drop shadow inside the rhs makes me think the designer gave it a zero
    fill and applied a stroke, then the shadow effect.

  body: Ach, I thought this might be the answer. Just trying to save myself a bit
    of work + have a font I can reuse in a stylesheet. Thank you very much for the
    advice; it looks horrible anyway, so I think I'll go and dig out something similar
    yet pleasant. Cheers
