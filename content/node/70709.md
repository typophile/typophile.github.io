  and students to draw more.\r\nAt the moment its a small group of us that use to
  draw regularly but have lost touch with the art form because of our careers. Even
  as  designer its very hard to find time to draw simply for pleasure and for sharing.\r\n\r\nThe
  logo began as Calgary from Veer but has been tweaked based on how I've tried to
  recreate it by hand organically.\r\nI hope you like it and can give me some feedback.

    of the Y and the loopy curviness of the rest of it. Since I just arrived here
    (via a Tweet, no less), I've got to say that the version in the original didn't
    bother me at all ... but if it had to evolve, this last evolution is really working
    for me. The nature of the line is organic enough that its straightness is a pleasant
    contrast rather than a discordant visual note.\r\n\r\nWith the new thickened tail
    on the end of the loop of the Y, I think its right where it needs to be. I enjoy
    looking at it.\r\n\r\nWRT to the rest, as Tomi says, you're not making a font.
    The unnevenness in the bottom of the miniscule \"h\" harmonizes very nicely with
    the rest of the design; I enjoy its quirkiness. It also seems to echo the design
    of the miniscule k, though, because of the way everything connects, it's not obvious.\r\n\r\nI
    think it nifty!"

    kind of neutered everything. \r\n\r\n@apankrat/DavM The name came organically
    actually. I find it very legible but I also find most graffiti tags/throw-ups
    legible even though there is more interest in the form than the legibility. In
    that way my concept for the logo was probably destined for this kind of problem.
    The subtraction of a vowel comes from a passing web trend. I am a web designer
    by profession. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'll work on the angles. The slant might be too harsh
    or the spacing might need work.\r\nBefore I do that I'll probably test it out.

  body: 'All of this feedback is great: insightful comments, re-worked samples, an
    educated critique. But I feel like everyone is missing the point. We all know
    that most handwritten fonts are terrible; the second you realize that all your
    Es look exactly the same (and so on), it is very easy to abandon said fonts and,
    by extension, hand rendered letterforms. But, in the end, it doesn''t matter how
    the Y looks; if you were ever to use it, you would surely alter it to fit the
    vibe of your design. You could render the font in Illustrator, add a finely tuned
    vector to make that Y just right, but you would still be neglecting the other
    5 letters. On the other side, if you were to use the "Sktchy" lettering as a reference,
    a hand rendering would be cognizant of structure as well as a client''s preferences
    while maintaining the fluidity and seemingly inconsistent nature of handwriting.
    The resulting piece is technically and visually sound. By definition, graffiti
    is without intended structure, but if you were to apply a structure to it, you
    bridge the gap and open yourself up to a very marketable style. Thus, we should
    spend more time drawing and less time being robots...'

    I also disagree that most handwritten fonts are terrible. They just dont have
    the practicality and adaptability of other types of fonts. I do like the idea

  body: "Sorry, that was a horrible explanation. Let me try again:\r\n\r\nWhen I first
    read the post, I thought pK touched on a really interesting idea, the importance
    of occasionally removing yourself from professional constraints to relax, draw
    something, and remember why you enjoy what you do. I read the \"Sktchy\" layout
    as an encouraging example, \"this is what I did, now you try.\" I hadn't intended
    to comment, but I happened to scroll down and saw some of the previous responses.
    I expected to see people posting their own experiments, maybe discussing the possibilities
    of hand rendered letterforms, but I just felt like I was in a Creative Department
    meeting, and it was disappointing. I have been working with psychedelic typography
    a lot recently, and, in the process, I have spent a lot of time analyzing every
    aspect of creating hand-rendered compositions that are interesting and retain
    structure and visual continuity without being repetitious (which is where the
    graffiti and handwritten font comments came from). I guess I took issue with the
    idea that, with the comments I read, it seemed like no one took the time to draw
    anything, they just vectored alterations to the Y form. Having discussed hand-rendering
    with pK in the past, I felt like there was more substance to the idea, especially
    when applied to web graphics, because no one really does hand-rendering for web
    and it seems to have become a neglected resource. I agree that it is not always
    appropriate, but, in the event that it is, it can be extremely tedious if you're
    out of practice (which I was going into this project), thus the importance of
    trying to remain in the habit of drawing, even without a specific purpose. That
    is what I was trying to say before; my apologies for the way it came out the first
    time."

    spend my days with brush and pen... not a \"drawing pen.\" The vectorized form
    is the final stage for me... but as a result of honing the forms beforehand it
    is simply a digital process.\r\n\r\nI stayed out of this as I can sometimes become
    overbearing when those who haven't a clue chime in and impose their ill informed
    opinions.\r\n\r\nYou have to understand the characteristics of what the individual
    tools \"lay down\" as a result of their very architecture. This piece is most
    definitely brush inspired so why not start with a brush, then you can chisel away
    at the unwanted. Your weights are all over the place, but the first \"y\" was
    fine. Turn it upside down and paste it to the wall and live with it for a couple
    of days... then you will see what is right or what is irking you. Look for holes,
    light spots, black masses etc.\r\n\r\nAll handwriiten fonts are not terrible...
    you just have to be judicious with what you buy (because there is a lot of junk
    out there) and how you use it. I once encountered a font that I absolutely abhored
    but then saw it used in a careful way. It was stunning and I was surprised. Hell
    I would have bought it as a result of the creative directors careful use of it
    in a project.\r\n\r\nAnyway, since it is your project, take your time. "

    software that emulates brush/pen movement for the purpose of type design? What
    I mean is something like this - I draw a skeleton of a letter, which is an approximation
    of a path of a tip of a brush. The software then would trace the brush along the
    path <em>modifying its shape depending on various parameters</em> such as the
    curvature and inclination of the path. So, for example, sharper bends would be
    constructed with a brush shape than is different from that of long straight segments.
    \r\n\r\nI had an idea of writing a tool like this just to play and experiment

    the calligraphic stroke is being lost to people who \"draw\" and/or digitize.
    \r\n\r\nYears ago when I produced Pouty, the final nerd in the process changed
    a couple of the forms. I called and asked why... her response was a pen could
    not do that. I asked her if she had ever even held a pen and she said no. At that
