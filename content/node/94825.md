  maybe four.onum_alt would be better? From what I understand, four.onum1 is preferred,
  but it is not that descriptive as I would like.\r\n-How big of a problem this kind
  of naming is and where the problems/compatibility issues would be likely to occur?\r\n\r\nI'm
  also intersted to hear about possible ways to fix it. I found www.typophile.com/node/80760
  where a \"Rename Glyphs by Regex\" script by Adam Twardoch was mentioned. This sounds
  like a tool for the job if it renames glyphs also in the opentype code and classes?
  However, I didn't find the actual script from Google. Is it publicly available,
  or should I just turn to Adam directly?"

  body: "Any of four.onum.alt, four.onum_alt, or four.onum1 should be fine. There's
    no reason why the latter should be preferred AFAIK.\r\n\r\nfour_onum.alt, however
    is definitely not a good idea. The problem will arise in situations where a file
    is converted to postscript in the middle of a workflow (e.g. when using Acrobat
    Distiller) in which case unicode values will be lost and those values must be
    reconstructed from the glyph names.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, the unicode value is
    determined from the base name ignoring all dot suffixes. The base name must be
    either a legitimate postscript name (either a name from the Adobe Glyph List or
    a name of the form uniXXXX) or a ligature composed of legitimate names separated
    by underscores.\r\n\r\nfour_onum.alt would thus be interpreted as a ligature of
    four and (the non-legitimately named and likely nonexistent glyph) onum.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "I'm not familiar with the script Adam mentioned. Unfortunately I know of
    no easy way to rename all your glyphs all at once within FontLab. It's easy enough
    to change the final suffix en masse, but anything involving either the base or
    a non-final suffix must be done manually or via a python script.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: Yeah, I really would like to learn Python and do it myself. Both options seem
    a bit daunting tasks.
