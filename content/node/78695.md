body: "This font appears on several sources that have nothing in common, so i am sure
  that it is an existing font :\r\n\r\n1- In the title on top of a page inside of
  a French book about the Monty Pythons published in 2010 :\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/8493bacb3e5d2960b2ce6468129cfe71.701875.jpg\"
  />\r\nThe book is http://www.cherche-midi.com/theme/Le_grand_livre_des_Monty_Python-_MONTY_PYTHON_-9782749116952.html
  but the font doesn't appear on the cover.\r\n\r\n2- On the cover of an album from
  the Scottish band \u201CThe Tannahill Weavers\u201D \u201CThe Mermaid\u2019s Song\u201D
  released in 1992 :\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/10_ms.jpg\" />\r\nhttp://www.theballadeers.com/scots/tw_d20_ms.htm\r\nSo
  the font is not a brand new creation.\r\nSomebody posted on the wtf forum a cleaner
  sample of some letters from the title of this album but he deleted the arrows because
  he believed that they were a customisation of the font whereas they are certainly
  part of the font :\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/5ddffc343d25e8905253dcba8d2a8d2a.631993-RVB.jpeg\"
  />\r\n\r\n3- Someone posted a picture using the same font (without specifying its
  source) on the wtf forum but you must ignore the \"A\" that is obviously from another
  font and the \"S\" that is different from the scottish CD and was probably manually
  created by using the top of a \u201CR\u201D (the person that created this Argonauts
  title probably ignored the font and didn't have all the letters required) :\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/88cb7e3ba55e16a41b972c5008be6ba2.16241.png\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  first saw this font on the Monty Python book when I was shopping for Christmas and
  later I saw it again at the myfonts wtf forum but without identification :\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/338858/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/81977/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/352072/\r\n"
