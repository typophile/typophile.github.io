  body: "This looks like a very mainstream comic face, so I was sure I would find
    it quickly at Comicraft, but in fact I could not find it there - or on Blambot
    (had it been there, it would have had to have been one of their pay fonts).\r\n\r\nI
    did see some faces on Blambot that did resemble this face in certain details,
    even though they weren't a match, and it's entirely possible I just missed the
    right face somewhere at Comicraft.\r\n\r\nI've looked around at other possible
    sources of comic book fonts, and JY Camelot, no longer available anywhere, looks
    like a possibility. I also checked Canada Type, but I didn't go through all their
    comic book faces, so that's still a possibility too.\r\n\r\nMight Makes Right
    at Blambot, and Meanwhile at Comicraft, both have a similar feel, but neither
    one is a match.\r\n\r\nO.K. I've got a source: All-New Ghost Rider 004. No additional
    samples yet.\r\n\r\nNow I've found some.\r\n\r\n[[http://moarpowah.com/2014/05/16/review-all-new-ghost-rider-3/]]\r\n[[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2014/04/15/the-crazy-manic-silver-age-style-origin-of-the-all-new-ghost-rider/]]\r\n\r\nAnd
    now I see why I couldn't find a match.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=7328]]\r\n\r\nThis
    comic, by the major comics publisher Marvel, used real hand lettering... by Joe
    Caramagna.\r\n\r\nActually, it might be a font - a lettering studio, Virtual Calligraphy,
    established by one Chris Eliopoulos, does lettering, apparently exclusively for
    Marvel (they don't have a web site) using fonts they've made for their own internal
    use, so if it is a font, it's not generally available."
