body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nApologies for the nerdiness on a first post.\r\n\r\nIn
  the midst of some last checks before releasing my first real font, I noticed an
  unpleasant beating frequency effect on repeated characters at smallish ppems when
  testing on Windows 7 with the \"Natural\" mode of DirectWrite ClearType rendering
  (tested via Firefox with the Anti-aliasing Tuner add-on).  The characters phase
  in and out of different degrees of bluriness.\r\n\r\nWith a bit of investigation,
  it looks like this is due to fractional advance widths.  I was hoping to be able
  to control for this by slightly adjusting the advance width phantom point via TrueType
  hinting.  However, it looks like Windows is ignoring that in this rendering mode
  and using only the designed width instead.\r\n\r\nAttached is an extremely simple
  test case (TTX format, renamed to .txt) that shows this.  In the lower case x glyph
  slot it has a pointed cross occupying a 1000 font unit square, with a width set
  to 1000 font units (no sidebearings).  The glyph program is the following:\r\n\r\n<pre>SVTCA[x-axis]\r\nPUSHB_2\r\n
  17            // Advance width phantom point (16 points in curve)\r\n 0             //
  CVT 0 (2000 font units)\r\nMIAP[no-rnd]</pre>\r\n\r\nThe test font also has the
  following simple preprogram:\r\n\r\n<pre>PUSHB_2        // New font with ClearType
  support\r\n 4\r\n 3\r\nINSTCTRL\r\nPUSHW_1        // 64 pixel cut-in (i.e., not
  a factor)\r\n 4096\r\nSCVTCI</pre>\r\n\r\nTesting this out, I see that DirectWrite's
  GDI Classic and GDI Natural rendering modes correctly handle this; a string of xxxxx
  shows the expected double spacing between the glyphs.  However, this is missing
  from the Natural and Natural Symmetric modes and they render with something closer
  to the designed widths instead:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/widthtest_4207.gif]\r\n\r\nSo
  this brings me to the following questions:\r\n\r\n1) Is there any voodoo that I
  can do to get it to honor hints that adjust the width?  Or am I simply stuck with
  the beat pattern here?\r\n\r\n2) I notice that in the documentation for <code>DWRITE_RENDERING_MODE</code>
  for Windows 8 and later, the descriptions for Natural and Natural Symmetric mention
  that the glyph advances are rounded to whole pixels.  However, no such mention is
  made of this in the corresponding documentation for earlier versions of Windows.
  \ Does Windows 8 therefore not have the same beat problem?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    to respect the width hints.\r\n\r\nShortly after fractional width rendering (subpixel
    positioning) was introduced, I suggested to some people at MS that it would be
    good if there were a flag in the font that one could set to indicate to DWrite
    that one wanted full pixel spacing to be used. [The context for this is that we
    were designing some fonts for specific ppem sizes on full pixel grids, but when
    they were preceded on the line by other fonts they were getting knocked off the
    grid in DWrite environments.] The folks I spoke to agreed that such a flag would
    have been a useful thing, but thought it was too late to introduce it."

  body: "Hi John,\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into that for me.  It's a shame to hear
    that, but I can't say I'm suprised.\r\n\r\nIt's too bad that they seemed to go
    to such trouble to preserve backward compatibility with the various ClearType
    rendering options, but didn't provide a way for forward compatibility.  I'd have
    thought that some combination of the GASP table and <code>INSTCTRL</code> (beyond
    just the 4 3 flag and selector) would be ideal.\r\n\r\nI realize that the world
    is generally moving away from hinting, but from my experience as an enthusiastic
    amateur in font design, it still seems like carefully chosen TrueType instructions
    have every bit as much to say as the raw splines about the visual character of
    a font at lower resolutions.  Likewise, I feel feel strongly that the choice between
    whole pixel grids, subpixel grids, and lack of grids ought to be a design decision
    that belongs in the fonts themselves (at least for fonts new enough to be aware
    of such things).\r\n\r\nOh well.  Thanks again.\r\n"

    since the instructions were reliable. The proof is now out that only the rich
    can make viable solutions for the web, to a great extent, because of this windows
    rendering. And the bottleneck it has created is not just Google fonts opportunity.\r\n\r\n\"Likewise,
    I feel feel strongly that the choice between whole pixel grids, subpixel grids,

    (at least for fonts new enough to be aware of such things).\"\r\n\r\nThis goes
    back to the gasp table's invention which is not so new either. What is new here
    is that so many more people understand the issue, and that the fonts MS was afraid
    of rendering because of evil hints, must be dead and gone by now?\r\n\r\nMy favorite
    comment, is that you'd a thought MS would make Some Way forward for excellence
    in hinting. Can we have x back on windows now? Is the x box done hogging it?;)"

    but the rendering environments at which their heavy delta hinting was targeted
    have died and gone, so the obvious solution would be to rehint those fonts for
    modern rendering environments."

    a professional software developer with an expertise in graphics algorithms.\r\n\r\nI
    spend a lot of time reading code on screen and several years ago I found myself
    not completely happy with any of the available typefaces.  So I set out to make
    one I'd like to use.  Working on it soon became a hobby and I got a bit crazy
    with it (to the point of teaching myself to write TT hinting instructions).  What
    can I say? I'm very demanding of my pixels, both at work and at home.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
