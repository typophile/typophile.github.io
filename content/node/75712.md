body: Hello everyone, I'm new to graphic design on a professional level. I didn't
  go to school for it and it has always been a hobby of mine. I ended up getting a
  job at a local printing shop that does a local paper in my area. I feel like it
  have a lot of catching up to do on my design because it's so different from what
  I'm used to doing as a hobby. Can anyone recommend any good sites to pick up tricks
  and tips with? Thank you!

  body: "Welcome!  \r\n\r\nYou say that design has been a hobby; can you give us a
    bit more info on your background and skill levels? For example do you have a good
    basic understanding of typography, or would you consider yourself a beginner?
    What graphic design applications (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, etc) are you
    familiar with, and which ones will you need to use in your new job?  Also are
    you interested mainly in learning more about type, or do you also need to know
    more about graphic design in general (photography, illustration, advertising techniques,
    etc)?"

    tuning your skills. Although it has to be said that you've made a step in the
    right direction by registering with Typophile. I've referenced it for ages as
    you can always find opinions/solutions to problems you encounter as a designer.\r\n\r\nGraphic
