body: "I need to create a brochure about renewable energy sources and green building
  options, etc.\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone had some good suggestions for a font that
  seemed up-to-date, a bit modern (perhaps sans serif)--which would be suitable for
  a brochure (requiring upper and lower case bolds, plus semi bolds and italics for
  the heads and subheads--plus work in small copy)."

    given the ecological impact of printing and shipping pieces of paper. Or maybe
    I''d just use Gotham. '

    says it's \"based on the open sauce letter font Vera Sans\". That was still a

    folk aren't too interested in ecofont anymore as a green typeface. Lots of nice
    alternative options available!"
