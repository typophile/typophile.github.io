  a 'perfect' font for a magazine redesign. I thought I'd finally settled with Chronice
  and Verlag but now not sure. My company is buying the fonts in and I don't want
  to get them in, and then find out that they are no good!\r\n\r\nI'm looking for
  a contempory serif font for body text and sans for the headline/captions etc. The
  mag is very stylish, b&w photography mag  \r\n\r\nMy shortlist includes: freight,
  proxima nova, paperback, thorndale, alfon, breuer text, camingo, klavika...\r\n\r\nI'm
  so confused!!! Not asking you to do my job for me, but any suggestions/guidence
  would be great!"

  body: "During the past several months, <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman\"
    target=new>Whitman</a> has been expanded for a couple magazines, including <cite>The
    Knot</cite> and the recent <cite>Fortune</cite> redesign. The newer fonts are
    not available via FB's retail site just yet, but they are available for license
    through the Font Bureau. You'll need to contact them directly if you're interested.
    I could also send you some PDF samples, if you want to contact me directly via
    my Typophile contact.\r\n\r\nSome examples can be seen at www.kentlew.com, but
    many of the <cite>Fortune</cite> commissions aren't shown yet. \r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "When you find a candidate, be sure to go to the foundry's web site (or write
    them) and make sure the license allows you do use the fonts as you need. Some
    foundries, for example, won't let you embed the fonts in a PDF file to send to
    the printer (rare, but it happens). Some won't let you embed the fonts in a PDF
    file that will appear on line (quite common). Some foundries have different pricing
    depending on how the fonts will be used (e.g. on line, print only, etc. etc.).\r\n\r\nIn
    passing I can't imagine using Paperback for an \"stylish, arty photography magazine\";
    maybe that's just my lack of imagination."
