  No Name) and a single, Selfish Jean.\r\nWith Selfish Jean comes a website (http://www.selfishjean.com),
  where one can confess acts of selfishness, donate for a good cause and download
  a free font. Design credits of the font go to Martin Demetri, but my guess is, it's
  based on his handwriting.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/selfishjean_6411.jpg]"
