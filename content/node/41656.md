  body: I (like the others, apparently) thought you were way off base with the gothic/Kanzlei
    angle, Alberta H. Not so, as it turns out. With only your partial 2 and 7 to judge
    from, your typeface appears to be Steelplate Textura. This was digitiized by <a
    href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/blackjewels/index.htm"
    target="_blank">Paul Lloyd</a> as Dampfplatz (A poor job. I mention it only because
    it offers shaded/inline fonts as well) and <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/s/steelplate.htm"
    target="_blank">Dieter Steffmann</a> (a <em>much</em> better version).
