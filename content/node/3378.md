body: I was shopping at the Half Price Books on Ford Parkway in St. Paul on Saturday
  and saw they had a stack of Sebastian Carter&#39;s &#34;Twentieth Century Type Designers&#34;
  in hardcover, New Edition, 1995. I checked Norton&#39;s website and it says the
  book is out-of-print. Amazon has only five copies available. I bought me a copy,
  but there are more available for you Twin Cities typophiles to snatch up. <BR> <BR>
