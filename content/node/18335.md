body: Apparently, or according to WIki, the preferred term is "Number Sign", but Mr.
  Bringhurst says Octothorp. I just was wondering why in particular there is so many
  different names for this symbol (i.e. pound sign, hash mark, etc.). Anybody have
  any empirical knowledge about this.

  body: "According to <a href=\"http://www.octothorp.us/octothorp.html\">this website</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"The
    word \"octothorp\" is so obscure that isn't even in the Oxford English Dictionary
    (first or second editions). Here's how the typographic stylist and philosopher
    Robert Bringhurst defines \"octothorp\" in his brilliant Elements of Typographic
    Style (p. 282):</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Otherwise known as the numeral sign. It has
    also been used as a symbol for the pound avoirdupois, but this usage is now archaic.
    In cartography, it is also a symbol for village: eight fields around a central
    square, and this is the source of its name. Octothorp means eight fields.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>This
    kind of etymology usually raises red flags of suspicion \u2014 and rightly so.
    But we can testify that we've seen the octothorp on maps used in exactly the way
    Bringhurst says. (We'll try to add an image here showing this, when we can.)\"</cite>\r\n\r\nApparently
    it's correct. But I'm more used to calling it a hash, or \"hekje\" which means
    \"fence\" or \"grid\" in Dutch."

  body: interesting. i suppose i was just curious as to how other typographers refer
    to this mark. "Woulter" how do you pronounce, phonetically, "hekje"?
