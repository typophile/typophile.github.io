  typeface everywhere. The last place was on clearlybesottedstamps.com. Many companies
  have used this font for commercial use, so I'm sure it is available I just can't
  find it. Close to My Heart created an alpha stamp set with it called Friendship,
  but that is not its official name. I have searched everywhere, but I cannot locate
  the original designer or even a sample. "
