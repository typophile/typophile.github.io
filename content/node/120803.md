    was made the numerals were the designs of the watchmaker/jeweler who made the
    watch. I doubt this was based on a typeface that existed at the time, which makes
    it unlikely that anyone would have digitized it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Blunt sans serif at one end of the section and Tuscan fishtail split end terminating
    on one side with a curl at the other end; or an angled Ionic column effect from
    having two curls, with the curl on one side flipped up, at the other end. The
    two sections are stacked.

  body: "Found many Tuscan with the same \"fishtails\" ornaments but most of the time,
    they come with no digits and don't have these snail/spiral/ionic serifs/finials/terminals.
    Most of the time, they're tagged/referenced as '[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Acircus|circus]]'
    and sometimes the fishtail decorated part is available separately so maybe transplanted
    to ionic serifs one? Half fishtail, half ionic but 100% Franken-font. Makes sense?\r\nAnother
    one, quite nice is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typerepublic/carmen-fiesta|Carmen

  body: Mike Yanega, this watch is probably more than 100 years old, but i'm not sure.
    I too believe it was not based on a typeface, but i was trying to find a similar
    one.

  body: "For the game of making a patch up font, Carmen Fiesta and portions of Gold
    Standard have some tweekable stuff.\r\nUnfortunately, in a case like this its
    more effective to create the right modules from scratch and assemble the numbers
    from them. The same modules could be used to build an alphabet starting with the
    basic letter-forms of a high contrast font, such as a heavy Bodoni.  \r\nBTW here
    are a couple of split segment fonts that catch a little of the flavor of the design
