body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I am designing something theoretical using a font called &#34;Chrysler.&#34;
  &#40;a condensed art deco font&#41;. If the design is approved, I would like to
  buy it, but can&#39;t really find it anywhere. It does appear to be a commercial
  font, and one source led me to Hoefler but on their site, it&#39;s nowhere to be
  found. Help? <BR> <BR>Thanks

    or thewhole alphabet, if possible. There&#39;s always the chance it has been re-named,and
    we may know it by another name.

    <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s just a noncommercial ripoff of this, but it&#39;s not
    exactly the same. For instance, the &#34;Y&#34; doesn&#39;t curve at the bottom
    but is shaped more like a &#34;4&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m uploading a jpeg -- hope
