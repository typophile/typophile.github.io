  say this looks just like Futura Demibold, but the 'T' is wider. Is this a custom
  logo, a modified Futura, or another typeface?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Offhand, my first reaction was good luck, because these letters are not distinctive
    enough to make a clear ID. The differences between whatever this is really, and
    half a dozen (or more)other sans serif fonts would be very hard to say, without
    close side-by-side comparisons.\r\n\r\nSo with that said, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/agenda/\">Font
    Bureau Agenda</a> Semibold is my candidate for a font that is VERY close, but
    not identical.It even has the shorter middle arms on the E and F.\r\n\r\nAny one
    of these similar fonts could be made to look identical with minor tweaking. It's
    the letters we can't see that would tell the story.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
