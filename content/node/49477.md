  \r\n\r\nI know this is probably a custom made font, but it reminds me the calligraphic
  style of a 1963 Ben Shann poem.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ben-shann_5778.jpg]"

  body: "It is indeed custom. Drawn by [[http://covers.fwis.com/everything_is_illuminated|Jon
    Gray]] and digitized by FontShop I believe. The actual name is HP PSG. It exists
    as a full typeface and also has numerous alternate vector drawings of single letters.\r\n\r\nThe
    text that reads \"The Computer is Personal Again\" is actually an official logo
    lockup so it is was made separately from the typeface.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yes. There is actually quite a slew of pre-made illustrations that we made
    for the campaign as well, that hand being one of them. I am not positive how many
    of the illustrations he worked on personally, but they all carry some of his style.
