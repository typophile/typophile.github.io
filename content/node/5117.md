body: Good day.  Here is a logo for my own business that I woul like to be critiqued.  I&#39;m
  starting up some freelance work since I&#39;ve just finnished school and I need
  an identity.  I choose Metric Design, since I am a canadian living in the US and
  the name suggests a different way of looking at things.  I basically settled on
  a geometric shape&#40;s&#41; in the form of an &#34;M&#34; and simple text for the
  logo &#40;eurostile&#41;.  Here it is on what I would like to be my business card.  Its
  fairly narrow of a card, 4cmx9cm.  It is all pantone metallic silver ink, because
  I want it to look like a ruler.  There is a diecut circle like most aluminium rulers
  have &#40;which I will be doing myslelf after print, with a simple handheld holepunch&#41;,
  and on the back is an actual ruler in centimeters with a small conversion chart
  for cm to inch. <BR>I want it printed on a very heavy stock paper.  What do you
  think?  I would love coments and critisisms.  Thankyou. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37729.jpg"

  body: I just wingin it here, <BR>Your identity seems like it is on the right track
    but I do have a few suggestions. Take em&#39; or leave em&#39;. First, I feel
    that the 3 dementional logo doesn&#39;t relate to the ruler idea which you are
    presenting on the back of the card. When I think of metric I think of the centimeter&#40;singular&#41;
    which you have used as a graphic element on the back. I don&#39;t think of three
    dementional space as much. Basically what I am trying to say is that there might
    be to many things going on on this card. I wish there was a way to integrate the
    centimeter scale idea with the logo. You know.. it&#39;s early in the morning
    so if I am not making any sense I am terribly sorry. Oh! have you tried just using
    1 centemeter unit for the logo. The lines of the centemeter kind of look like
    an M for metic. Anyway I hope some of that makes sense.

    top of the logo with a solid line or as Hrant said extend the two end lines to
    create more of an m. If you put a lid on the top, however you might find that
    you will not need to adjust the end lines to fix the legibility issue. Check out
    the MIT logo for a little inspiration.

  body: I don&#39;t think the logo works as well if it isn&#39;t done in the actual
    scale of a cm. I am also loosing the &#34;m&#34; when you have it next to the
    edge. I liked it better as a singular unit away from the edge. The card as it
    currently stands is still pushing overkill. The numbers on the ruler kind of dilute
    the paterning effect of the logo.  <BR> <BR>SHOW ME A PRINTER THAT WILL CROP A
    CARD PRECICELY 9 CM EVERY SINGLE TIME AND I WILL USE THEM FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
    <BR> <BR>You are weighing alot of effort on the production of this thing by having
    information so close to the edge with no room for bleed. <BR> <BR>Another thing
    to think about as a young designer is cost. The way you have your card right know
    could be a costly endeavor to produce correctly. <BR> <BR>

    edge.  I could just bleed the ruler&#39;s lines off the card and it should crop
    fine. ?  Keep in mind neither of these cards are marked properly for print, they

    the concept will seem almost incomplete. Try what Dan said about placing the metric
    m in silver on a white background. You might find that the flexiblity of your
    identity will instantly change. If you are still married to metalic inks you could
    coat the back of the card with solid silver. You would still be implying the ruler
    surface and without getting into overkill land. Raise this question to yourself.
    Are you trying to develop a ruler or a buisness card? They both serve two completely
    different functions.
