body: "On sunday I felt I needed to create a typeface to be able to live with myself.
  From scratch and in absence of any direct influence. Here's what it has become so
  far.\r\n\r\nWhat my purpose for this typeface is:\r\n-Relatively big x-height (attenuation
  of hierarchy)\r\n-Some caps with similitude to the lowercase (e.g B, C, D, P, R)
  (attenuation of hierarchy)\r\n-Semi Serif with more contrast (without resembling
  Rotis)\r\n-Combine modulation of stroke with a geometric feel\r\n-Character set
  will contain old-style figures, ligatures, alternates\r\n-Modest language coverage\r\n-Experiment
  with interpolation: extra light version will be more geometric, fat version will
  have a much more modulated stroke.\r\n-Italics with a moderate 5\xB0 slope\r\n-Redemption\r\n\r\n(Sorry
  for the text sample, it's InDesign's optical kerning, which is too tight.)"

  body: "I'm impressed how you've reacted to this whole situation. \r\n\r\nI don't
    generally prefer semi serif designs (what's the point?) but I did say I'd give
    some critique so here goes ;)\r\n\r\nThe overall colour of the face is quite dark,
    making me think it's intended for small sizes; however the spacing is rather tight,
    so I'd want to change one of those variables and have a particular target size
    in mind. Wordspace is also rather narrow.\r\n\r\nYou have a good grasp of the
    stroke modulation, but there are a couple of weird spots (the bowl of the /a/
    has a thinning unrepeated in other letters, and the pointed crossbars of /f/ and
    /t/ are problematic).\r\n\r\nI think a smaller x-height would suit this classical
    style of letterform better.\r\n\r\nThere's some peculiarity with your bowl curves
    on /BDPRbmnp/. In a face like this (classical proportions, geometric forms) I'd
    expect the curves to be completely smooth, not cuspy. The /q/ and /b/ don't necessarily
    have to relate, but I think the /q/ is out of character with the geometric feel.\r\n\r\nThin
    strokes are a bit inconsistent. Take the /M/ and /N/ where you flare the thins,
    but the /KVWXY/ don't have comparable styling.\r\n\r\n/mnpru/ have curved instrokes
    at the spurs, which doesn't fit the expectation created by /BDPRbd/.\r\n\r\nI'd
    make the vertical serifs on /cfsz/ more prominent or you might end up with uneven
    colour in paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe /g/, I'd keep as an alternate but it's going
    to be a deal-breaker for text settings. There's enough personality in the rest
    of the face to attract people, without a fetishist /g/.\r\n\r\nOutstroke of /s/
    should be clipped perpendicular to the ductus like the /cert/.\r\n\r\nThose diagonal
    serifs on /GVWvwy/ aren't working yet."

  body: I'm not really feeling the lowercase yet though I like /k/ and /g/. The capitals
    are quite delicious though. However, there's a tension in there which annoys me
    a bit. Oedipus seems to be wanting to be classical and modern at the same time
    and doesn't quite know how to pull it off. It seems it's several typefaces in
    one. There's definitely potential though.

    right, thanks! And on the other hand, you made me notice the light italics are
    a bit to thick.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I started thinking about the italics I was
    sure I wanted them to be very divergent from the roman (lowercase)*. They stand
    out, more than ordinary italics do, but I don't see this as a con. As long as
    the weights/kerning of the italic and roman harmonize well with each other, I'm
    pleased. I feel that if I additionally drew normal italics, as a second (first)
    choice, I'd be over-seasoning my meal.\r\n\r\nThe regular italic uppercase has
    different shaped serifs (just that weight, because I'm testing), but I guess will
    smoothen them out again. I'm not sure about that.\r\n\r\nThanks for your nice
