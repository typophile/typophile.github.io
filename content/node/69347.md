    during lunch at work I noticed an extra large carton of o.j. having a subtitle

  body: Don't forget PT Sans (http://www.paratype.com/public/) It's a nice sans text
    face with excellent Cyrillic and Latin coverage (though it doesn't have much Greek,
    which precludes it from being a truly pan-European face). And its free, both as
    in beer and as in freedom (view the changelog to download a copy that they released
    under the OFL)
