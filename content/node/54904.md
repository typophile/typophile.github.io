  I was wondering if anyone knew what the font used in the title of this book is called.
  \r\n\r\nIt seems similar to ITC Avant Garde Gothic Light, but the x-height is different,
  the circles are not as large as in Avant Garde, and the heights of the stems are
  much taller. Also the \"s\" on the cover is not as tight as the \"s\" in Avant Garde.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buildingconstruction-dkching_3669.jpg]"
