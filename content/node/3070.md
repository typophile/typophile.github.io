body: Hi, <BR> <BR>doing a job for a travel co offering holidays to Romania. <BR>
  <BR>The website is live &#40;<a href="http://www.festivaltravel.co.uk" target="_blank">www.festivaltravel.co.uk</a>&#41;
  and the logo is nailed &#40;not here for a crit, certain many here could slaughter
  my feebleness!&#41; rather I&#39;m here for some much needed deadline slamming into
  me help... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m using Drescher Grotesk throughout but the client has
  asked for cedillas and accents. I can see them in the Character Palette &#40;I&#39;m
  using Panther BTW&#41; and I can double-click in there to get them to appear as
  unicode in Tidetext/textedit but of course not in illustrator &#40;10&#41; or InDesign
  &#40;2&#41;. <BR> <BR>I cannot purchase the font/s as Opentype &#40;I guess that
  would solve the issue?!&#41; and here in London it&#39;s 3.15am and I&#39;ve lost
  the will to live trying to fathom this out. <BR> <BR>Anyone able to solve this or
  say for certain it&#39;s impossible? Can&#39;t even find how to get the accent for
  a la carte ATM. <BR> <BR>Many thanks for any help offered!

  body: Try creating a text file in your text editor, saving it, and then importing
    it into InDesign and Illustrator. This should work in any version of InDesign;
    you may need Illustrator CS, as this is the only version of Illustrator that supports
    Unicode. <BR> <BR>Note that you can also use the InDesign glyph palette, accessible
    from the Type menu. <BR> <BR>By the way, if you have Romanian text, the typographically
    correct form for the &#39;cedilla&#39; is actually a kind of small, unattached
    comma-like mark under the S and T. This may be encoded &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;
    or T with <i>cedilla</i> because this is the codepoint used in the old Romanian
    8-bit codepages. In Unicode, the Romanian diacritics were disunified from the
    cedilla forms, and given their own codepoints. You will, of course, be limited
    by what your font supports.

  body: Weird, for some reason Typophile automatically censored &#39;as&#39; followed
    by &#39;S&#39;, even though there was a space between them. Not only can&#39;t
    the software spell arse correcly, it can&#39;t spell &#149;&#149;&#149; right
    either.

  body: I could be wrong, John, but there might be a simpler solution to Marc&#39;s
    dilemma. <BR> <BR>Depending on which characters you need, you may be able to type
    them directly from the keyboard. The tricky part is knowing which keys or key
    combinations to type. <BR> <BR>Before Panther, you could just check the Key Caps
    utility. In Panther, Apple kind of hid hid it. <a href="http://www.maccritic.com/tips/article/294_0_12_0_M/"
    target="_blank">here is a page</a> that tells how to get it out of hiding. It&#39;s
    called the Keyboard Viewer now. Once you have it open on your screen, you can
    find the characters you want easily by trying different shift and option combinations.
    <BR> <BR>Alternatively, there are charts showing the standard key combinations,
    such as <a href="http://www.idiomware.com/accents.html" target="_blank">this one</a>.
    <BR> <BR>It may also be that the font you have does not have the exact accented
    characters you need. In that case, if you look in the Keyboard Viewer, you will
    see that there are also accents by themselves. These can be combined with any
    character using kerning to position them.

    use the Glyph palette &#40;under Type : Insert Glyphs&#41; is the way to go. It
    shows all of the characters in a given font; double clicking on any character
    in the palette adds it at your insertion point.'

  body: Thanks for the responses. <BR> <BR>Have opened the keyboard viewer - the characters
    I need are not shown there. <BR> <BR>HOWEVER... I went back after re-reading Marc&#39;s
    post... Insert Glyphs is the kiddie! <BR> <BR>Just need a way to crack that in
    AI and I&#39;m cool &#40;I assume that I can do that in AI CS?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Many
    thanks. <BR> <BR>I knew someone here would crack this. Consider me happy ;-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll be back here to educate and enjoy when I kill this deadline!
    <BR> <BR>Thanks. One and all... &#42;retires busy but happy

  body: John gets all the credit here. I was just directing your attention to his
    post. As for getting those elusive characters into AI, could you insert them into
    InD using the glyph palette, then use a simple cut and paste to move them to AI?

    is that only the new Illustrator CS supports Unicode text encoding, so you are
    likely to run into problems pasting Unicode characters into earlier versions.
