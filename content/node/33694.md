  to them today and they will not budge on this. They know you can't embed the font
  in a PDF for a proof to customers and that you can't package the fonts with an Indesign
  document. I was told that the solution is for us as users of their fonts to convert
  them to curves/outlines before saving the files. The lady I talked to told me that
  this is going to be the policy from now on because of piracy and that they don't
  care if it makes customers mad or if they loose my business. She told me there are
  other font venders out there and I was welcome to go elsewhere if I did not agree
  with their policy.\r\nI am saddened by this. We all know that this will do nothing
  to prevent piracy. We have many examples that this sort of anti-piracy effort does
  not work. It does however, curtail the rights of honest consumers, just trying to
  purchase and use their fonts.\r\n\r\nPlease help me make this known\r\n\r\n\"\u2026Personally,
  I think they will regret this. I hope they do.\r\nLet's make noise and boycott them
  so that maybe they will change.\r\nWe need to pass this along to others and get
  the word out.\r\nHere is what they\u2019ve done:\r\n1. You no longer receive an
  actual font file, at least not that you can see.\r\n2. Instead what you download
  is an installer that installs an application called \u201CLetterhead Fonts\u201D
  (at least on Macintosh which is what I use).\r\n3. The fonts are either embedded
  in this \u201CLetterhead Fonts\u201D application or somewhere else unknown/hidden
  from the user. No fonts are installed in the traditional Font folder locations.\r\n4.
  Once installed, the \u201CLetterhead Fonts\u201D application activates the fonts
  permanently, at least as far as I can tell, like a font manager. You see them only
  in the font menus of your other applications, nowhere else. It also doesn\u2019t
  currently allow fonts to be seen or managed in font manager applications like Suitcase,
  Font Agent, etc., though LHF apparently plans to add this capability.\r\nAside from
  the obvious antipiracy objective, here are the biggest ramifications and problems
  I see for the user (myself, for one):\r\n- You are completely prohibited from organizing
  the fonts like you want on your hard drive, such as for classification or other
  purposes. All your flexibility is taken away including any system or method that
  you might have had in place to manage fonts for your own needs.\r\n- As mentioned,
  the LHF fonts can\u2019t be activated individually. It\u2019s an all or nothing
  proposition. (Unless/until they enable font managers to \u201Csee\u201D the fonts
  perhaps, but maybe not even then, I haven\u2019t seen them say.)\r\n- It means you
  can\u2019t add kerning pairs to a font, for example, or otherwise tweak the font
  yourself if problems are found or you have special needs.\r\n- And of course, you
  can\u2019t really back up the fonts themselves. Your only recourse if something
  were to happen is a reinstall from the various installers you may have accumulated
  over time, or else go back to their site for the installers there. (They do make
  provision for downloading previous font orders you have made with their new shopping
  cart system.)\r\nA real shame since this will probably make a lot of people think
  twice about buying additional fonts once they see how it works the first time. I
  know it has me, despite LHF\u2019s unique fonts. Lots of other good independent
  foundries around these days as alternatives. What do the rest of you think about
  where LHF has gone with this?\""

    we're back to that old situation where the cracked software, by virtue of having
    the protection removed, is actually more convenient to use; \"better\" than the
    product paying customers get!"

    have come from a PC. I'm neither a hacker nor a pirate, just curious.

    The lady was right. There ARE other font vendors out there. In fact, these other
    vendors should all hire her to do their advertising, but keep her at a good, safe
    distance.\r\n"
