  signage systems (municipal information systems in particular)?\r\n\r\nSo far I've
  found some websites dedicated to such systems like <a href=http://www.bristollegiblecity.info>Bristol
  Legible City</a> and similar.\r\n\r\nI'd like, however, to go deeper in the problem
  and read more about technical aspects of signage. Like legibility of a sign/type
  in low light conditions, what is the relation of the size of a sign post to a human
  height, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are some <a href=http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_/202-8044240-1491806?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=wayfinding&Go.x=0&Go.y=0>books</a>
  but would appreciate any recommendations on these.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n__\r\nAL"

    People, signs, and architecture.</em> New York, McGraw-Hill, Inc.  \r\n\r\nYou
    might also find a use for many of the essays in W.F.E. Preiser. (1989) <em>Building

    Methods, and Applications, held as part of the Tenth Biannual conference of the

    found a swack of stuff when I was researching my Masters, but it's a pretty long

  body: "Aleksander,\r\n\r\nI suggest you also make a point of examining the wayfinding
    graphics in the Underground and in any other transit system you happen to visit.
    Unfamiliar systems might be more instructive than ones you know. Some systems
    are like textbooks in what not to do, and can be instructive from a commonsense
    point of view. If I'm on a train, in a station, and there's no sign visible, either
    inside or outside of the train, telling me what station I'm at, then something's
    wrong. Basic functionality like this is a very worthy starting point, since some
    systems have yet to achieve it. Sign placement, type sizes, location, traffic
    patterns, direction, are all more fundamental issues than things like halation
    and color. "

  body: "Thanks all.\r\n\r\nCarl, I'm in London and examining the Tube's visual system
    every day. It even inspired me for designing a <a href=http://www.rzeczy.net/intro/podrorz/>\"cover\"
    for on-line design magazine</a> (when you hover over the line's names, letters
    appear making word <cite>L\u0105dek</cite> which is Polish familiar name for London).\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'd like to know more is the whole process of analysis of a city, gathereing all
    the information, asking questions and then transforming all this to a system.
    So, the bigger picture first.\r\n\r\nLast year in Design Week I've read that London
    will have new uniform signage system for pedestrians.Do you know any details -
    who, when..?\r\n\r\n_______\r\n AL\r\n<a href=http://www.lenart.pl>lenart.pl</a>"
