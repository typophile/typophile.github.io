  always been helpful, I have decided to take the plunge and actually post a query
  for once, so here goes:\r\n\r\nI am designing a cover for a book relating to the
  history of WWII, Germany in particular. I used Tannenberg Fett and DIN as my main
  typefaces, because I liked the modernity of hard edges and I thought the sharp edges
  seemed to work well to represent the time period and the aesthetic theme of the
  cover, in that the design slowly becomes more and more hard-edged and angular, as
  the book describes germany from before the war to during the war and I wanted to
  represent this shift visually...(sorry I can't show images at the moment, but I'll
  just try to describe what I was going for)\r\n\r\nHowever, while the design was
  approved, and no one thinks that the design has Nazi overtones, the author has had
  reservations about the use of Tannenburg, so I have to change the typeface to something
  else. After research into the rise of the Schaftsteiffelgrotesk type of letterforms,
  I can see his point.\r\n\r\nSo: Does anyone have any suggestions about a German
  typeface, pre-WWII, that doesn't seem to convey \"Nazi\" all the while conveying
  both \"German\" and \"hard-edged\"? Is there a modern blackletter that would be
  suitable? Or, is there another, German, non-blackletter typeface that fits the bill?
  \r\n\r\nI have found Potsdam, but I am concerned it is too similar to Tannenburg.\r\nhttp://moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/htm/potsdam.htm\r\n\r\nAnd
  I have found this logo, which I like the look of as well, but I am not too sure
  where I can find German typefaces like this, or if this is again too close to Tannenburg:
  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/70153157@N00/2296495586/\r\n\r\nI don't want
  to glorify the Third Reich, obviously, but I want to find something that communicates
  the period and culture, yet has a minimal, geometric feel, and I am not sure where
  to go.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nStef"

    and without any Nazi undertones.\r\n\r\nP22 has some nice ones:\r\n\r\nhttp://p22.com/products/bauhaus.html\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    why not trying a black, condensed, pushing german Grotesk, like Futura bold Condensed

  body: "Thanks for the quick response, I'm liking the suggestions, in particular
    Kaas and Fanfare, though I am liking Verlag and the idea of using Bauhaus/Futura/grotesk
    type fonts after all (I think I was being a little too rigid about what I needed,
    so it's nice to get some different opinions to help me see the light!)\r\n\r\nAs
    for Jessenschrift, I think it might not be hard-edged enough for the design, but
    I am remembering it for the future, as where I work I do alot of WWII history
    books so I need a good list of typefaces from the period to use...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"
