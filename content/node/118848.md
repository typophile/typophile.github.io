  body: "Couldn't find an exact match, but it looks like a subtler/less florid version
    of Latin, which itself is derived from a wood type original:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/latin/\r\n\r\nIf
    you can tell me the year of the sample, I might be able to match it to a type
    specimen book of the era."

    (1882):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.archive.org/stream/fifteenthbookofs00cincrich#page/n5/mode/2up\r\n\r\nIt's
    called Runic (upper right corner of this page):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fifteenthbookofs00cincrich_0069_4076.jpg]\r\n\r\nThere's
    a contemporary typeface of the same name by Monotype, but it isn't a match to
    your sample or the Cincinnati sample."
