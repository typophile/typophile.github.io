  of old [[woodtype|wood]] or metal type, or maybe original ink designs, or antique
  [[letterpress]] posters, presses or whatever everyone has...\r\n\r\n(I guess this
  as well my interest in type generally, is sparked partly by a recent trip to Puglia
  in Italy - I was surprised to find an old fashioned print workshop seemed to be
  a standard fixture in every town. I nipped into one (I think in Lecce) and was shown
  around by the elderly owner who showed me all his letterpress stuff, at first I
  thought he kept it fo posterity -- but he explained it was all very much still in
  use for wedding stationery and church festival posters. To be honest he seemed a
  little bemused by my interest...anyway I digress) \r\n\r\nShow us what you've got!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "After some fifty-odd years of collecting effects for my printshop/foundry
    I've got more stuff than I can list, but one part of the collection that interest
    most visitors is the shelf unit holding about sixty suites of Monotype Giant Caster
    matrices.\r\n\r\nThese are what most people in the \"private press\" area of interest
    would find to be ugly typefaces: Bodoni Bold and Italic, Jefferson Gothic, Onyx,
    Goudy Handtooled, Brush Script, Valiant, Franklin Gothic etc. Okay, even I think
    Goudy Handtooled is a little on the homely side.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I had another
    art college class visit. The instructor zeroed in on the Brush Script and fell
    in love with the mats, showing them to his class. This box of Brush Script contains
    the rare Th and tt logotypes along with two or three others. The mats are all
    in the large size range of 42 to 72 point, and are punched aluminum.\r\n\r\nI've
    been wanting to do a sample casting of as many of them as I can to include in
    a little autobigraphy (ego, ego) I am writing and printing. This seems to me to
    be a good reason to drag them out and put them on the Super Caster, since they
    haven't been cast into for many many years.\r\n\r\nOne other oddity is a suite
    of about a dozen engraved brass mats which are large condensed figures: 10, 20,
    30, etc. These are engraved in reverse into a checkered background. They look
    like they were custom engraved for use in horse racing betting slips or something
    like that. anyone ever seen this kind of thing???\r\n\r\nI did have one nifty
    font of woodtype a few years back; a very odd size of 51 picas. I've never seen
    such an unusual size before or since. They went on to be donated to an art school
    some years back. The school dumped the type along with all of the little printshop
    about four years ago. Dumb buggers.\r\n\r\nI've got a box of miscellaneous Giant
    Caster mats containing a set of figures of Bodoni Black Condensed in 120 point.
    These were intended to be cast \"sideways\" on the mold of the Giant Caster. They
    won't fit on the Super Caster so I keep them as a curiosity.\r\n\r\nJim\r\n\r\n"

  body: although my personal collection is sparse nowadays, i was head letterpress
    printer at boxcar press for two years. we had a fair amount of wood and metal
    type (and had access to all of syracuse university's metal - original goudy stuff)..
    we printed almost exclusively from polymer, though. all way up to 22 x 30 inch
    bases on heidelberg cylinder letterpress presses. good times.
