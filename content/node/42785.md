  body: "But I think the one you have isn't the same as the current logo and font.
    Not sure I just checked and the 'R' and 'i' aren't the same. But we can't find
    any old logos for the Land Registry\r\n\r\nwww.landregistry.gov.uk\r\n"

  body: I checked their site, didnt see it. I guess maybe Dalton Maag did the type
    while North (www.northdesign.co.uk) did the symbol and art direction. I might
    be wrong, though :)
