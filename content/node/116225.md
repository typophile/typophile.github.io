  body: Scotch Roman may be as close as we can get in digital type - nothing else
    seems to fit the basic shapes.

  body: "Yes your  curled _g_ is very similar to the  Monotype Baskerville of 1924,
    which is more or less matched by the digital Baskerville Old Face http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/baskerville-old-face/
    and the rest is similar to Scotch Roman. So I suggest this hybrid design may be
    a Swedish original, or perhaps an import from a German foundry. Stempel? Nothing
    digital that I recognize.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Congratulations John. Jaspert's _Type Encyclopaedia_ continues to be a great
    resource for type finding. But so time consuming to use. The only way to search
    it is to start with _a_ and trudge though to _z_ for its very broad type categories.
    Sometimes you have to do more than one because a typeface ends up where you would
    not expect it to be.\r\nDon"
