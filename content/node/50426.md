  this website.. adn I'm now trying to track him down.. \r\n\r\nI believe I worked
  with his father, Clare Menking, many years ago at the Archbishop Sheen Center in
  Dallas, Texas.  If that is him, it is OK to give him my email address or phone.
  \ I know his Mom well and would love to be able to talk to her again.. and to also
  catch up with Justin. \r\n\r\nPatricia Martin \r\nMartin Media (972) 333-6722 \r\nmartinmm@verizon.net

    his profile page</a>.\r\nYou might reconsider making your email address publicly
    available, unprotected \u2013 you run the risk of it being harvested by spam bots.\r\nF"
