  So, hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI have a question. I need a typeface for an ebook. I know
  the usual requirements; good hinting, high x-height, thick lines... But I don't
  know how to proceed after them. Neither Kindle nor Kobo renders kernings.\r\n\r\nSo,
  which typeface offers the best performance without kerning and has the usual requirements?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    certainly prefer to use the publisher defaults option of the ereader. We are only
    looking for a text typeface, others are set.
