  and decide on a classic typeface that I would work on. The idea is to incorporate
  elements of our personal handwriting into it. So while I start on my research, I
  thought I'd just seek some opinions on what's already been done (and well received)
  and what are some typefaces that you would recommend that I look at. Any help's
  appreciated, thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nzq"
