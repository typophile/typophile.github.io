  body: "This is \"inverted contrast\" or \"reverse contrast\" lettering. \r\nDidn't
    find this as a font but still looking.\r\nA less extreme similar font: Signo http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/r-type/signo/\r\nThe
    best known reverse contrast font is Antique Olive http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/antique-olive/\r\nSome
    that are more extreme: ITC Zipper http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/zipper/\r\nStretto

    you are referring to another font?\r\nVery confusing site.\r\nDon"

  body: This is a custom typeface designed by Mads Freund Brunse for this specific
    series of events in Copenhagen. Maybe one day we might release it on www.ortype.is

  body: "Thanks for sharing the info on Mads Freund Brunse. I find his custom typeface
    fits together well and is more attractive than most reverse contrast fonts. I
    don't know whether it was intended to evoke the rhythms of boogie-woogie music
    but the letters seem to suggest a bouncy theme without resorting to an irregular
    baseline.\r\nAre any more letters available for viewing?\r\nDon"
