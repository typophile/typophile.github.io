  theme; Caxton has been picked by the client as the typeface. I need to find some
  ornaments to help the text, basically enhanced vertical and horizontal rules; decoration
  is not my strong suit. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThis seemed like it was heading in
  the right direction, but it's a little steep for approximately four uses.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/51317\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTom"
