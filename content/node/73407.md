  newb when it comes to commercial printers.\r\n\r\nMost online printers have such
  bad quality paper stock, I want to use my own stock paper from a specialty mill.\r\n\r\nThe
  stocks I want to use are typically 110lb to 120lb and do not really work well with
  laser, I would need an offset printer or some other alternative?\r\n\r\nAre there
  any online places that specialize in printing on specialty papers that except full
  color files?\r\n\r\nWould it be better to just go to a local printer with my paper?\r\n\r\nAlso
  how does the paper size and cut work in offset printers? I can order many different
  size papers, but which sizes work best for a printer? Say I need business card size
  or invitation, how exactly do the printers print the sizes, before or after they
  are cut?\r\n\r\nI know about letterpress and litho, but that is out of my price
  range ( I think). What I really want is to order some great specialty paper and
  hand it over to an offset printer with my files and say how much..finding out how
  to do that is more difficult than I though it would be.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny advice appreciated,
  \r\n\r\nCheers."

    need to go to a local printer and they will order the paper for you. Good printers
    will probably not let you supply the paper because it\u2019s not cost-effective
    to do business with people too cheap to pay the paper markup. Just call up some
    printers and ask to talk to someone in sales."

  body: I don't mind paying the markup, what I do mind is it not being available,
    taking to long to order, and being an overall hassle when I have the paper right
    in my hands. Also some printers have deals with certain distributors, what if
    I want paper from another mill that they do not carry, do I have to find another
    printer, not as easy as it sounds. The mark-up on the paper is not exactly bumping
    up the bottom line a whole lot for smaller jobs of 300-500, which is what I'm
    looking for.

    of the job, but typically printers will use large sheets and will print several
    copies per sheet, then cut them apart after they're dry. Printing multiple copies
    on each sheet greatly reduces the length of time that the printing press is tied
    up with the job.\r\n\r\nBut for small jobs -- like a few hundred flyers that are
    8.5 x 11 -- a printer may just put the job on a small press and print them 1-up,
    since the entire job will only take a few minutes to print anyway.\r\n\r\n> Would
    it be better to just go to a\r\n>  local printer with my paper?\r\n\r\nMost online
    printers are in the business of providing cheap printing, so it's unlikely they'd
    work with special stocks just for you, so a local printer might be your best bet.
    However it's very unusual for a customer to provide their own stock, so they'd
    probably increase the price since they aren't getting their markup, and you'd
    need to give them plenty of extra sheets for test copies during setup and so forth.
    \r\n\r\nIf it's an unusual stock, keep in mind that the printer may have no experience
    printing on it and the results may not be optimal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Forgot to answer the "business card" part of your question. With an offset
    press I believe they typically print several per sheet, even if only a small number
    are being printed. They don't want a tiny little piece of paper going through
    the press.

    per-unit cost is going to look outrageous no matter what, with a quantity that
    small. Since you can get ten to twelve up (depending on bleed) on a standard letter-size
    sheet, your printer is likely to use as many--or more--sheets setting up this
    job than actually printing it."

  body: "I feel there could be a new generation of printers out there. A new private
    press.\r\n\r\nMany people working in print now have been working since the 1970s
    and they are a bit stuck in their ways. First thing out of their mouth is usually,
    \"When I started we did paste-up and you don't even know what that is, you punk.\"
    And they drive around in cameros with fuzzy dice dangling from the mirror. And
    they recollect the 80s and 90s where the money was big, the parties were wild
    and the coke shipped clean and direct from a cartel.\r\n\r\nMany printers haven't
    aligned themselves service-wise with how the world is now. And nor have the paper
    companies: their product is all tied up in levels of distribution, each distributor
    pulling in their cut.\r\n\r\nRecently a printer visited me because he wanted me
    to print with him. He brought in a bunch of pizza fliers and blow-in ads for magazines
    and newspapers. I'm like, \"Why are you showing me this junk? I get it in the
    mail every day.\"\r\n\r\nI want to print things that honor the tree-matter used
    in the process. This usually would mean short runs with innovative techniques
    (how it folds, how it binds, etc etc). It's hard to find a printer who will work
    with you in this way.\r\n\r\nBut they are out there. You have to find them and
    make a relationship. A good printer helps with the creative -- if they are good
    and you have a good relationship with them, they are likely to provide ideas of
    paper, techniques and ways to limit costs.\r\n\r\nIn any case: I've spoken with
    some printers about bringing in my own stock. They are reluctant, but you can
    get the paper specs from the manufacturer then send the specs to the printer to
    ensure it will work on their machine with their inks.\r\n\r\nThe horrifying thing
    you learn about is make-ready. Say I want 60 envelopes printed. I would have to
    buy about 120 envelopes, because 60 will shoot through the press and into the
    waste. (No different than screen-printing really.)\r\n\r\nBack to the notion of
    private press: I see people (designers/artists) buying letterpresses, risographs,
    and more professional silkscreening equipment. I hope this continues to grow.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    most of the online stuff is gang-run on a given stock. This makes it cheaper,
    but it sounds like you would prefer to do custom work."

    setup for offset lithography is VERY different from setup for silk-screen."
