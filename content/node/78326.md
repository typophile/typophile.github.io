  12 thumbnails for each of the last two categories: Typographic Texture, & Structure/Proportion.
  I understand how to express the first two pretty easily, but these last two are
  stumping me. Could anybody give me some suggestions on how to display those last
  two categories in square compositions using Trade Gothic as my type family. '

  body: "Trade Gothic has pretty consistent structure.\r\nTake a look at the variants
    of House Industries' Chalet (London, Paris, Tokyo, NY, IIRC), for a typeface which
    is purposefully consistent in texture and proportion, but which has alternate
    structures within those strictures.\r\n\r\nDon't forget the famous Univers chart,
    which is what your instructor will expect to see.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/univers_3943_5361.gif]\r\n\r\nAlso
