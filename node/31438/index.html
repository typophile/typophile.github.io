<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I am having difficulties with this app -- trying it for the first time. I am unable to suss out what I'm doing wrong from the owner's manual, and so far have not had help from the realviz forum. It just occurred to me that maybe someone here uses this software. If so, and if you are willing to give me a bit o' simple tech support, please email me bruce@brucekennettstudio.com.
Thanks</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bruce - PhotoMerge in the PhotShop CS3 Beta does a great job - up to this point I had found PanoramaMaker to be better - but the new beta version of PhotoShop does a job on panos I could not get to blend smoothly before. Both it and PanoramaMaker are easy to use. No learning curve</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bob, thank you for the suggestions. My regular pro photography dealer (right in Southie, I'm sure you can imagine which place I mean) recommended that I download the Realviz app as the most easy and intuitive, which I did a couple of days ago for $120. Now that I've gone for a sniff at the Arcsoft site, PanoramaMaker looks to have a far simpler interface and it only costs $40! So much for easy and intuitive . . . Unfortunately, no tryout version of PanoramaMaker for Mac. I have p*ssed away so much time already struggling with Realviz, I may just buy the Arcsoft on faith, or jump into the CS3 beta (i'm on CS2 at the moment). First I have to go and reshoot my panorama (I'm doing all this for a single image, of one room interior, to put as a quicktime vr on a client's web site) with a more accurately-placed nodal point and with more image overlap. Should be pretty simple to do, though. Thanks again for the tip.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I got ArcSoft's PhotoStudio when I bought my Canon last year and was definitely not impressed with it -- having used some of their clip art collections in the past, I wouldn't call their interfaces "easy and intuitive" either, despite what it looks like on their website....
But when I got my camera, it came with a built-in stitcher that works just great -- I've only done one large panorama with it, but the only problem with it was the creature clicking the shutter. :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bruce: Linda is right that PhotoStudio is not that great - at the moment the free download of Photoshop CS3 Beta would be my Choice for good and easy - by the way PanoramaMaker 3 was better than the current version (4) for Mac.</div>

I went to the Adobe Lab site, and was poised to press the "download all 685 megabytes" button when I saw sys 10.4.8. Oh, bother. Never wanting to be on the bleeding edge of technology, I don't upgrade everything very often* and at the moment am still on 10.3.9. So no go on that scheme, I guess.
Bruce
*Here's an example: Apart from easy generation of PDFs in Quark 6.5, for the book work I need to do I'd still be plenty happy with 3.32r5. The disruption of an upgrade and having to learn to navigate around all the new "features" that I don't need always causes me no end of trouble, plus the domino effect that once you upgrade one thing, then it forces you to do a bunch more in related utilities and applications. (Grrr, I must have taken an extra curmudgeon pill with supper.)</div>

Oh c'mon Bruce: tell us how you really feel! ;-)
I'm running 10.4.9, but I'm also running a G3, which precludes me from running the CS3 beta.</div>
