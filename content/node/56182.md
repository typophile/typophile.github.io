body: "What is the optimal way to handle the lam_alef ligatures?\r\n\r\nNo matter
  how I do it, the ligature doesn't show up, although all my Latin/Greek ligatures
  do.  If I type lam, then alef, they connect as if they were any other letters in
  the alphabet.  In FontForge everything shows up okay.\r\n\r\nI admit it may be my
  program to edit with (TextEdit) since I don't have InDesign ME, but the ligature
  substitution seems to work okay for other OTF fonts in TextEdit.  All other substitutions
  appear okay."

  body: "Since the lam_alif \u2018ligature\u2019 is a required form, the lookup should
    be located in the Required Ligatures {rlig} feature.\r\n\r\nIn Arabic OT shaping,
    positional form substitutions are applied first, so ligature input glyphs need
    to be appropriate positional forms:\r\n\r\nlam.init alif.fina -> lam_alif\r\nlam.medi
    alif.fina -> lam_alif.fina\r\n\r\nIf you've done the above and it doesn't work
    in your test app, then your test app doesn't support Arabic OpenType."

    not aware of to do this substitution?\r\n\r\nI'm downloading Mellel since it claims
    it has its own OTF extensions.  Is there any other good (free or inexpensive)
    programs to use to test the Arabic OT fonts?  Mac or PC, as I could probably swipe
    my roommate's PC if need be.  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina

  body: "What are the other Arabic OT fonts? Are you sure they are using OTL tables
    and not AAT tables?\r\n\r\nMellel should work well for you. The OpenOffice.org
    apps should work too, but I've never tried the Mac version.\r\n\r\nOn Windows,
    you can test in Wordpad and NotePad."

  body: TextEdit on OS X 10.5 forms the lam_alif ligature correctly in Adobe Arabic.
    This one just has the OT tables, doesn't it?

  body: "Yes, Adobe Arabic uses OT.\r\n\r\nMatthew, are you using FontLab Studio for
    OTL work? If so, can you perhaps post the FDK syntax code you are using for the
    ligatures? \r\n\r\nI use VOLT for OTL work, so I might not be able to spot a problem,
    but perhaps someone will be able to.\r\n\r\nIf you are using VOLT, you could send
    me your source font, and I could troubleshoot it for you."

    \ \r\n\r\nThe tutorial I was following had \r\n\r\nfeature rlig { # Required Ligatures

    rlig;\r\n\r\nEven though you mentioned it should be media it just slipped right
    by me.  Now I've got it working.  Now as to whether I got everything properly
    designed, that's another question haha.  BTW, I'm actually using FontForge, it's
    not too hard to convert the syntax.  For posting for a critique on an arabic font
    is the critique section better or the special interest group?\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl
