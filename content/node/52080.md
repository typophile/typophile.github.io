  whether this has been turned into a font, and if so, what is it?  This is a bit
  grainy, so will look for a picture with better resolution and repost if I can.  Thanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CyrillicDwgFont_6382.jpg]"

    actually), ISOCPEur Italic, which is packaged with Autocad and has the cyrillic
    characters.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
