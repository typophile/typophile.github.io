  body: "I'm guessing this was drawn by hand and constructed out of circles - look
    at the awkward curves in the 'h'. As you suggested, Bryant would be a good alternate,
    as would Gotham Rounded.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Not so good. Widths are odd and 'e' is amateur. I would highly recommend <a

    Alt</a> (not condensed).

    is similar and nice too.  <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> currently
    uses it.

  body: "Thanks for your quick help :-) \r\nThis logo has the smell of my 70's Childhood,
    even it's not perfect.\r\n\r\nHope I could use a rounded typo like Bryant for
    my future works !\r\n"
