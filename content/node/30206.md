    by Scott Stowell at Open. RETINA was used for the Art:21 identity before it was
    mutated into an Agate. I thought everyone knew this story.\r\n\r\nDo I win a prize?\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph

  body: No prize, Randolph. Just the satisfaction of helping your fellow man and,
    occasionally, their gratitude (no guarantees there, though).

  body: It could belong to the same family, with the "art:21" being an extended cousin
    of the condensed Agate. I'll check with H&FJ as soon as I can.

  body: "Dear Bald Condensed,\r\n\r\nNo need to bother Johnathan and his staff. They
    are very busy right now. I'm sure that you saw the big announcement several weeks
    ago.\r\n\r\nTo find definitive information regarding Art:21 and RETINA, perform
    a Google query for those terms. Or simply check the Open web presence. Check the
    \"we are\" \"network\" section about HTF. I would post a link but I cannot figure
    out how to do so here.\r\n\r\nRETINA is a large family. I refer you to the May/June
    2004 \"Communication Arts\" article about HTF for more details.\r\n\r\nHow do
    I change the title of this section of the Forums to indicate that this typeface
    has been correctly identified?\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph T. Burke"

    is kind of a funny comment. H&FJ are always busy. If they are too busy or uninterested
    to answer an email about their work, they won't. No harm done."

  body: "Dear Bald Condensed,\r\n\r\nNo offense was taken by me and I certainly hope
    none was taken by you. I did not intend to give the impression that I was trying
    to stymie your efforts to provide a validated identification to our friend Drmns.
    I have spoken with Johnathan recently and he mentioned that they are very busy
    with EXCHANGE. I simply was trying to help you ferret out the truth in a timely
    manner. If any offense was taken by you, I offer my most sincere apologies. My
    colloquial expressions often get in the way of my meaning.\r\n\r\nIf facts are
    what you are after, I have a handful of leads for you:\r\n- The two sources I
    previously mentioned are relevant to this discussion.\r\n- Check with Scott Stowell
    at Open. He commissioned the font. I am sure that he will offer good information
    since he has been a friend of Johnathan's since before Jonathan shared that tiny
    office with Barry Deck. My goodness! What a scene that was!\r\n- If my memory
    is correct, this particular version of RETINA was shown as an example of Tobias'
    work in the TDC Annual in 2001. I believe that the caption mentioned Art:21. I
    could be mistaken on that last point. I do not have this annual anymore, but you
    should look into it.\r\n- Do check with H&FJ. They are busy but they are also
    very generous. They will eventually reply to your inquiry. Please tell them I
    said hello.\r\n\r\nDo you go through such extensive lengths to validate all type
    identifications in this forum? Impressive! Thank you for all your hard work!\r\n\r\nDo
    you know what Stephen finds funny about my earlier comment? I think he is making
    a joke at my expense.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph T. Burke\r\n"

    taken, none given, rest assured.\r\n\r\n> <em>Do check with H&FJ. They are busy

    him something on iChat. I'll tell him you said hello next time I talk to him.

    thank you, you're far too kind, I aim to serve. It's a pleasure to be able to
    give something back to the community. The crowd here is very friendly and helpful
    -- I don't know if I'd do the same voluntary work for any other board. And hey,
    it's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it. ;^)\r\n\r\n> <em>Do you know what
    Stephen finds funny about my earlier comment? I think he is making a joke at my
    expense.</em>\r\n\r\nI can assure you that Stephen is far too gracious a person
    to do such a thing. As my predecessor as head moderator of this board, he thought
    me everything about having a patient, kind and generally more mature online persona
    (though I sometimes still have a slip of the tongue I must confess)."

    get any farther without pointing out that Retina is Tobias' work, not mine. And
    Exchange, coincidentally enough (also from TFJ), makes its debut this very morning
