  by Kiss. I am looking specifically for the font the words &#34;Dressed To Kill&#34;
  were written in. Thank you!  <BR> <BR>Sean O&#39;Donnell

  body: I will try to scan it in and post it tomorrow. I found a lot of photos of
    it but the type is too small and it&#39;s an outline font. Thank you for your
    help!

  body: Uhh ... no. I personally never had the slightest taste for heavy metal - even
    in its heyday when I was the right age for it. <BR> <BR>No, somebody is selling
    this on e-bay, Patricia. If you hurry, you might be able to grab it!

  body: Here&#39;s a closer view of the title as seen on the album. If this is the
    one you want, it looks kind of like collegiate-style, though none I can find has
    the angled S like that. It&#39;s certainly pre-digital -- maybe something that
    never made it to digital status? I&#39;m sure Mark would know if no one else can
    id it. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37265.gif"

  body: Those obliques S.... <BR>Don&#39;t you think that maybe it&#39;s a custom
    job. <BR>If I had to design a cover for a group called kiSS, and in the title
    of the record I had again those SS, probably at least, I would give it a thought,
    something to play with, I don&#39;t know ... I&#39;m just guessing ... or alucinando?
