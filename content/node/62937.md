  in the first RAI trasmission. In te picture you can have a look at it. The screenshot
  is form 1954 .. I hope this can be useful. Actually any suggestion about similar
  mood\u2019s font is well accepted.\r\n\r\nJust to be precise, the typeface I am
  referring is the one which is used to write \xABrai - radiotelevisione italiana\xBB\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    serif.
