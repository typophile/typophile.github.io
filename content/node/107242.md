  a little but the basic font itself seems very familiar to me. I think I may have
  used it many years ago when I worked mostly on print stuff on a Mac. Help identifying
  this or suggesting a similar font would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Martin\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brush-script-type-font_5771.jpg]"
