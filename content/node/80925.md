  Myfonts:\r\n\r\nCorsham:\r\nCorsham was inspired by traditional stonemason's engraved
  lettering designs.  Designed to be used alone, or in combination with our Corton
  family, ithas wonderfully lively air, with distinctive lively serifs and beautifully
  swashed downstrokes. Four faces are offered-regular bold and black weights as well
  as a condensed form.  All faces include a range of Opentype features, including
  ligatures and old-style numerals.  The Corsham faces merge 'olde-worlde' charm with
  fun character, yet remaining clear and legible for text use.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Corsham_t_5577.png]\r\n\r\nMetropole:\r\nMetropole
  is an exercise in combing the curvaceous lines of the Art Nouveau with the solid
  character and simplicity of Art Deco.  The resulting three display faces combine
  the spirit of the 20s and of the thirties, creating lively fun display faces for
  headings, signage and banners.  These characterful faces with clear simple outlines
  are also ideal to lend a distinctive air to your web pages, or to create a distinctive
  'house-style' for lettering.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Metropole_t_5393.png]"
