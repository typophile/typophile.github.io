  How can you see is an adaptation of existing typography. I thought it was a Futura,
  but the capital S does not correspond to that family and that's where I started
  to doubt ...\r\nIt can be a Futura, but somehow type foundry  I unknown?\r\n\r\nIf
  someone in the photo can help me, thank you very much!\r\n\r\nMarc Salinas\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_4946.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_4908.jpg]"
