body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a typeface to start a personal book cover design
  project with.\r\n\r\nThere is a Phaidon book titled \"Cave Art,\" which is a beautiful
  book that is currently being sold with an ill thought-out dust jacket.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/caveArt_5367.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  hoping to make my own dust jacket for the book \u2013 at least it will look better
  on my shelf \u2013 and was hoping to get this community's opinions on an appropriate
  typeface to begin the redesign project with.\r\n\r\nIn Derek Birdsall's \"Notes
  on Book Design,\" the author talks about a book he produced (also as a personal
  project) about human technology though history and pre-history. His take on hyphenating
  the word \"technology\" in the title seems to modernize the potentially stodginess
  of the all-caps display serif.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/derekBirdsell_5170.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your input.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRoy"

  body: "The task is a tricky one, since the subject matter predates any form of writing.\r\nMy
    first impulse would be using something archaic looking (http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/numaoverview.html),
    but probably it could end up looking very feigned.\r\nSo I think the approach
    could be either something as neutral as possible, or something very contrasting
    (I'm thinking techno/sci-fi here, think 2001).\r\nAs for the actual cover, I think
    I can understand the reasoning behind it. But, in the same vein, I would rather
    have gone with a graffiti-like look. "
