  from 1957-1970? I have attached an example from 1969, more examples may be found
  here;\r\nhttp://www.plateshack.com/georgia/georgia3.html\r\nhttp://www.15q.net/ga.html\r\n\r\nI
  am trying to create a replica plate for a '69 Pontiac GTO, and I would like the
  font to be as close to the original as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSimon\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ga69_4119.jpg]"

  body: "I'd recommend looking for the small letters among the Techno freebies at
    Dafont. \r\nAs for the large numerals/letters, look at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontboutique/noga/|Noga]]
    from Font Boutique. It seemed to be the closest for all the characters. Many others
    were similar, but would have needed some serifs added or removed to match more
    closely.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for the Noga suggestion Mike. The regular version of the font seems
    pretty close. Probably close enough with some manual scaling & editing.\r\nI had
    a look through the \"Techno\" section on dafont, and couldn't come up with anything
    similar."

  body: "Yes, I see the A is the hardest part to match. Anything I've seen would require
    modifying the A, at least. Two candidates are Graham Meade's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheticals/modcon/|Modcon]],
    which you would need to thicken, or the freebie [[http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=dev_gothic&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=GEORGIAS&nb_ppp=10&psize=m&classt=alpha|Dev
