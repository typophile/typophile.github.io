  a conventional "farmstand" aesthetic. He showed me an old sign from his barn (attached)
  that he really likes, and wants something along the same lines. I realize many traditional
  farm signage was hand lettered, but I really am looking to purchase a font in this
  case, mostly for the sake of time. Anyone know of  a good source? My first instinct
  was Letterhead Fonts, but nothing there really did the trick for me. '

    my answer here. \r\n\r\nIf this is for a small farm stand (eggs, vegetables, etc
    sold by a family member in front of a farm), I think a hand lettered sign would
    be far more appropriate than a slick, professional sign. In fact when I was a
    design student in college, my professor used a farmstand sign as an example of
    a situation where a crude, hand-lettered sign on a piece of cardboard or plywood
    was entirely appropriate, and communicated the proper message. \r\n\r\nAs for
    the screen shot, that might be appropriate for a company selling farm equipment,
    but not for a farmer's child selling eggs by the driveway. If you want to use
    a font, I'd suggest looking for one that looks handwritten but is easy to read
    and perhaps has a bit of style, as if the farmer's artistic wife made it.\r\n\r\n(But
    if this is a bigger setup, like a building or large professional stand that's
    more like a retail store, then that's a different situation.)\r\n\r\n"

    sharp bracketed serifs as shown in your posting.\r\n\r\nHere it is in narrow:

    there's Turnip. It smells like a farm animal, and I don't think I'm getting that
    from the name alone:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/turnip/\r\n\r\nBest

    I would agree with James\u2019 assessment, and suggest Baker Signet\u2122 as having
    a classic formality, but with a more hand-made appearance.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/baker-signet/"
