  (book-style video game).\r\nAttached are the example files. Sorry if they are low-res,
  as that is all what's available.\r\nAs the game is in Japanese, the last example
  image is a kana\\kanji string. I don't know but maybe it might be of use too.\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    thing that I find different there is the height, but I guess the game makers might
    just had stretched it as they saw fit."
