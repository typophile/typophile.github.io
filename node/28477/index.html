  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>hi guys!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently in the process of designing a logo for a local architect who&rsquo;s got about 20 years of experience but finally decided to start his own bureau.</p>
<p>His area of activity reaches from building small hospitals to large casinos and it&rsquo;s currently a one-man business but he&rsquo;s NOT aiming to become a 50 people agency anyway..</p>
<p>He wanted his logo to be mainly typography which should be clean, corporate looking and shouldn&rsquo;t be embarrassing. The only shape or form I&rsquo;m allowed to use is a square due to his vision of a square being the ultimate form, undistorted and straightforward.</p>
<p>the concept I came up with can be seen here
<img src="/images/old-images/stefan_4698.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>STEFAN is placed in capitals to distuingish itself from &ldquo;architect&rdquo; and to make clear that the architect is called stefan&hellip;
the squares between the text are pretty small so that the don&rsquo;t stand out too much and they&rsquo;re seperated into 3 pieces to give the impression of something being built..
they also form an arrow pointing upwards to intensify the impression of something going on..</p>
<p>what do you think so far?</p>
<p>any c&amp;c appreciated
cheers mike</p>

		<div class="commentbody">There is something about the relationship between the two words – Stefan is not quite short enough to match the x-height of architekt (I should say this image size makes it difficult to be sure). I would also say the FA of Stefan and the hi of architekt need to be kerned slightly tighter. The squares don&rsquo;t sit comfortably with the type, perhaps if the top of the bottom square was flush with the x-height/cap height and moved slightly to the left. Again this is affected by screen/image size but the lowercase seems to have quite a rambling baseline, where the rounded characters overshoot and the dot of the i seems too prominent.
When reversed out is it your intention to use that rectangular shape or is that just an example?

		<div class="commentbody">It looks pleasant, but the vertical stroke of the T needs to be aligned with the square, not the terminal. I&rsquo;d also like to see the text aligned with the outer edge of the stroke as opposed being inside the square. Having it inside the square creates a good tension between the letter and the gap, but penetration would be more dynamic.</div>

<p>I&rsquo;d think about changing the colour of the frame. Also, maybe align the left edge of the stems of the &lsquo;T&rsquo; and &lsquo;N&rsquo; to the left edge of the frame border, rather than the right edge of the stems to the left edge of the frame border (I hope that makes sense).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>hi guys! The problem is that it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to convince the client of a different colour.. he is so satisfied with the yellow (which actually comes from concept number 1) because no political party in austria has got yellow as &ldquo;their&rdquo; colour.. ans since he&rsquo;s worried about being pushed into a political direction with choosing a different colour.. yellow is theonly option for him.
Personally I don&rsquo;t think that the yellow frame is such a huge problem because National Geographic is barely known in Austria..</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I really like this, I saw this as a flatplan of a room, not the National Geographic at first glance. I also like the colourways, the brightness of the yellow is offset by the charcoal greys and works well. It looks contemporary and quite sophisticated and I think it suits the subject matter really well.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the National Geographic, sure they employ a yellow frame, but it&rsquo;s rectangular not square; they&rsquo;re also in a completely different area of business.</p>
<p>Nice work!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hang on&hellip; the thing is, when a logo is posted on this forum, you&rsquo;re crucially seeing it <em>out of context</em>. The very fact that the word architect is part of the logo should mark it out as an architect&rsquo;s practice to the vast majority of people. I don&rsquo;t think if you saw a business card with the logo on you would think that it had some kind of bizarre architect/National Geographic affiliation. Sorry, can&rsquo;t see it myself.</p>
