  logotype that I'm trying to finish now. It's for our graphic design studio and should
  be very simple. I have decided to use this typeface [...and man it was hard] I need
  to know what is your choice? That happy \"e\" is on my mind now.\r\nWhat about spacing?\r\n\r\nThank
  you a lot! I really enjoy reading your thoughts on Typophile.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ECS
