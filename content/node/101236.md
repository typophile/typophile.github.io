body: Could you recommend a san serif to go with TEFF Trinite Roman Wide for a resume?
  I have used DTL Caspiri in the past, but its limited weights, cost, and imperfect
  match got me to thinking about a change. I have considered Whitney (maybe too large
  x-height and too small descenders), Ideal Sans (but the lowercase g would match
  more a transitional typeface, and Syntax (since it is based loosely on Stempel Garamond
  and has lowercase a and g that sort of match Trinite). Any suggestions from someone
  with a better eye than I have?

  body: "If you like Foundry Sans also look at the venerable Syntax, which AFAIK was
    the \"official\" inspiration for Foundry Sans; their main difference is that Syntax
    is very gently inclined (1/2 a degree I think) whereas Foundry Sans is fully upright
    (partly to avoid funny jaggies/anti-aliasing onscreen I think). And since Trinit\xE9
    is inclined, Syntax might actually be a better choice. If you like that sort of
    thing.  :-)\r\n\r\nIf you really want a super neutral sans check out Kievit.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for the suggestions.\r\n\r\nRegarding Trinit\xE9: It is calligraphic
    and not a general workhorse like Iowan Old Style or Minion (the latter really
    isn't so invisible, but its multilanguage support might make it good enough to
    use as a generic text font).\r\nAlthough Trinit\xE9 is a good choice in the book
    \"Turning over a New Leaf: Change and Development in the Medieval Book\", and
    is good for poetry (as was suggested in \"Book Typography: a designer's manual\",
    I think it is more versatile than that. It is hampered by its high price, older
    format (postscript), lack of ligatures, and weights (the medium is too bold).
    I think those are the major reasons one does not see it used more. In smaller
    sizes, the peculiarities of its calligraphic elements are diminished. Like various
    Garamonds, it requires some care in size, leading, layout, etc - maybe more than
    some other fonts, but that does not make it limited to poetry and whimsical text.\r\n\r\nMatching
    a sans is not easy. Maybe that is why Microsoft substituted Calibri for Times/Arial
    for its default Office (on the Windows side): it was good enough for short text,
    tables, and headings and pretty versatile in just four weights.\r\n\r\nI have
    seen the recommendations in \"The Big Book of Font Combinations\" for matching
    serif and san serif. Personally, the only nearly perfect match I've seen is with
    Scala. (It is my favorite for books that require a lot of tables and text). Even
    Documenta and Haarlemmer sans/serif variants clash a bit. When the Sans and Serif
    are clearly from different periods and very different, they can go fairly well
    together; and as they get closer, they start to clash. It is like colours.\r\n\r\nFoundary
    Sans is the closest I see to Trinit\xE9 in letterforms, but the lowercase \"a\"
    has a slanted bowl that really doesn't fit with the other letters nor with Trinit\xE9.
    Syntax has a very different x-height and the \"a\" is even more different and
    the angled feet on \"M\" and \"N\" doesn't work for me. \r\n\r\nSo, if there is
    not a good letterform match between a Sans and Serif, how does one pick a good
    match that is complementary and not clash? Arial/Helvetica and Times or Myriad
    and Minion are complementary but not even close to the same letter forms or even
    vintage but they work more or less."

  body: "Finding typefaces that are \"harmonious in spirit\" is difficult, because
    that requires a real understanding of the essence of several  typeface families.
    So assuming one is looking for a humanistic sans, if one wants to keep with Dutch
    typeface families, once comes up with one list, but Dutch typefaces are too broad
    to be the only limiter. Caligraphic typefaces would be another starting point,
    but that doesn't seem to work (Cronos or Beorcana for example). Scala Sans is
    not bad, and both derive from French old style, but some of the choices in modernization
    that went into Scala Serif are quite different than Trinit\xE9. Whitney is what
    Myriad should have been, and is the opposite: fairly bland and corporate looking.
    Ideal sans is not so ideal, because although it may be one of the most readable
    sans, many serifs are more readable, and most of the subtle curves get lost at
    small sizes. (it also has a distinctive \"M\" and \"g\" which make it not blend
    well with other fonts, and I think its individual letter forms look better than
    words using it.) Probably that is why finding good graphic designers is neither
    easy nor cheap."

    Leaving aside the purpose, can you recommend a complimentary sans? "

    also have some differences). Easier said than done!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Competition is good. The Bastarda has passing similarity with Trinite but
    does not look like documenta.  (i.e. there are at least two different Dutch typefaces
    in the world) Most people who spent a lot of money on anything will be biased
    in favor of it, so maybe that is why I really really like Trinite, not just like
    it. It is important to believe we have used our money wisely, whether it is true
    or not.
