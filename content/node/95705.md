    has an interesting bi-chromatic effect with horizontal and vertical lines.

    was set by typing PpEeXx.\r\nThe majuscule characters provide the outline of the
    glyph, the minuscule the body; each character is half the width of the composite
    glyph. \r\nThe advantage of this method is that there are no layers with the resulting
    issue of selection and registration, and one may adjust colors in the color palette
    without selecting any of the text.\r\nThe disadvantage is that it only works for
    one case of letters.\r\n\r\nIt would work with normal text if \u201Cone to many\u201D
    substitutions were implemented in OpenType."

  body: "> How hard would it be to include layers with assignable rgb color codes
    in OTF?\r\n\r\nWell, it would require extensions to the OpenType format, such
    as those proposed by Microsoft, Adobe+Mozilla, or Google.  http://blog.fontlab.com/font-tech/color-fonts/color-font-format-proposals/\r\n\r\nThis
    stuff is all implemented and working somewhere, but there is no standard across
    platforms and major apps. (Apple's own take has not been proposed as a standard,
    but it is a bitmap format like Google's.)"
