  body: "I had spent some time looking for this one, because the LITTLE DARLIN lettering
    looked so familiar, but the best I could come up with in digital form was House's
    Bullet, Red Rooster's Radiant and Image Club's Serpentine Sans. None was a complete
    match. I also looked at some of the Photo-Lettering Catalogs from the 60's and
    70's and found some candidates with names like Rhein Rapport, Manifesto, and Pacella
    Pace Biform. The last one looks quite similar and even included the same style
    N. All of them were stressed (uneven) sans styles. I'm afraid many of the typefaces
    of the 60's stayed there, and never made it into digital form.\r\n\r\n - Mike
