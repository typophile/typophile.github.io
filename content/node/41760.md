  body: "Thanks Florian,\r\n\r\nYeah the font does seem to be Annonce - but I cannot
    find the right weight anywhere on the net. Though this was from a pressing done
    in the 20's or so - no digital typefaces back then. Is it possible that the weight
    Werkman used wasn't digitised?\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

  body: "<em>\"but I cannot find the right weight anywhere on the net\"</em>\r\n\r\nIsn't
    the weight of the Canada Type font the same as your sample?\r\n\r\nThe Jaspert
    \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" says that Annonce Grotesk \"is one of the most
    widely distributed typefaces\" and was in the type catalogs of type foundries
    all over Europe. It says it was issued by Wagner & Schmidt 1914 under the name
    \"Grotesk V\" and later \"Krupp Hallo\". (\"Annonce\" was the Dutch name.)  The
    description says nothing about other weights, except that an italic weight was
    added in 1959 by Ludwig & Mayer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The version made by Canada Type looks very much like a sample from an old
    catalogue, and I could only find one weight of annonce, called \"vette annonce\".
    Maybe the ink and paper make your version look a little bit more bold (or vet)\r\n"
