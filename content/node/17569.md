  question I have been asking everyone, with no satisfactory response.\r\n\r\nThere
  is a master page with page numbers. On some of the actual pages, there are sometimes
  background objects which are \"sent to back\", but still cover up the page numbers.
  How does one make sure the master page numbers always appears in 'front'?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: What you also can do is click on the page number holding the command and shif
    button (Mac). You can now move the 'page number box'.
