  weights. An opentype face with lots of glyphs would be great too.\r\n\r\nThings
  I like about this face is \r\n\r\n - its condensed nature,\r\n - vertical terminals
  on diagonal characters (e.g leg of the R)\r\n - and the digits\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n[[http://andychung.ca/work/neighbourhood/

    too."

  body: Lineto's [[http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Latest+Releases/Replica/|Replica]]
    would be an excellent alternative. It does have similar terminals.

  body: "Thanks guys,\r\n\r\nI was looking at Replica it is quite nice. Someone also
    mentioned [[http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Custom+Typefaces/Alpha+Headline/ |
    Alpha headline]] but I find it a bit clunky (and it's not comercially available),
    another similar face was [[http://www.type.co.uk/index.php?p=a_to_z&let=*&id=10697
    | Carplates]]"

  body: I find Alpha Headline far less clunky than Carplates. I forgot to mention
    Lineto's Simple also.

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI agree about Carplates, it has real presence though.\r\n\r\nIt's
    funny you mention Simple, when I asked the designer of Neighbourhood if there
    were any references or influences he mentioned Simple. Obviously different though.\r\n\r\nCheers,"
