  for print that features them and I can't find the font they used in their logo.
  It appears to be a blend of serif/sans font - not sure.\r\n\r\nThe image on this
  post is pulled from their site header at www.intradiem.com\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/intradiem_6465.png]"
