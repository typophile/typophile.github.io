  body: "Yes, Stephen, especially the R, but even that is a rather superficial resemblance.
    My theory is that it's a 'mutilation' of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bernhard-modern/bold/testdrive.html?s=THER&p=72\"
    target=\"new\">Bernhard Modern</a>, or perhaps <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/charlemagne/bold/testdrive.html?s=THER&p=72\"
    target=\"new\">Charlemagne</a>.\r\n- Mike Yanega"
