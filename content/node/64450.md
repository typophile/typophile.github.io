body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm currently developing an online English phrase guide (www.speakenglish.co.uk),
  which is being translated into a number of different languages.\r\n\r\nWe are looking
  to make the site available in Persian and Urdu, and I am therefore researching which
  fonts would be best to use for these languages.\r\n\r\nWe would need to use fonts
  which are Unicode-compatible, and they would also need to be available for free.\r\n\r\nMy
  understanding is that Nasta'liq is preferred style for writing both these languages,
  so if possible would like to make our site available in Nasta'liq.\r\n\r\nOne font
  we are considering using is Pak Nastaleeq, which seems to work well for Urdu. Would
  it be suitable for Persian as well, or is there a font which would work better for
  that language? Are there any other fonts which we should be looking at?\r\n\r\nAny
  advice would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nChris\r\nwww.speaklanguages.co.uk\r\n"

    by Iran Islamic regime government site. It's free. That's the only free Persian
    Nasta'liq I know.\r\nhttp://www.scict.ir/Portal/File/ShowFile.aspx?ID=bea5ca36-1fdf-41d4-8818-c1a4f9c71081"

  body: "Many thanks for your reply. It sounds like the font you mentioned isn't really
    ready for final use, so I guess we'll have to forget about Nasta'liq for now.\r\n\r\nDo
    you happen to have an opinion about the fonts mentioned on this page?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.farsiweb.ir/wiki/Products/PersianFonts\r\n\r\nI
    also see Tahoma is used on quite a lot of Persian websites. Does that deal with
    characters specific to Persian correctly?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nChris\r\n"

    you gave up on Nasta'liq, I suggest XB Zar or XB Niloofar of the following collection:\r\nhttp://wiki.irmug.org/index.php/X_Series_2\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBehnam"
