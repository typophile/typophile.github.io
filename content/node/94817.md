  is really wonder.\r\nBut if you have a look on the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/20745656@N00/3740798234/in/photostream/\">name
  </a>(in this case \"Gerard H\xF6weler\") that follow every catalogue, that typeface
  isn't worse.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know something about that \"typewriter\"(?) typeface?\r\n\r\n----------\r\nF\xE1bio

    use with typewriters, but because the technology had changed before he finished
    it, I don't believe it was ever released.  Plus I think it was more of his standard
    straight line only grid inspired designs, certainly not a badly inked courier
    type of thing like this.\r\n\r\nPosting a pic here, cuz who knows how long links
    are good for.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/crouwelType_4078.png]"

    Wim Crouwel's catalogue. But I can\xB4t explain why. Valentine seems a beautiful
    design typeface (I need to explore more), that 'a' makes my head fix in it. Thanks
