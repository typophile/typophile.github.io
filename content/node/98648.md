  body: "\"ZEBRA AND GIRAFFE\" is a handlettring, entirely done from scratch, by [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/ZEBRA-GIRAFFE-T-SHIRT-DESIGN/4989625|Hylton
    Warburton]] (sketch [[http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles12/496251/projects/4989625/8a2586ae96402df0806bb12fe94a9b8a.png|here]])
    so definitely not-a-font.\r\nFor \"THOMAS OLIVER BAND\", I think it's a customization
    of an existing typeface. If I have to reproduce it, I'd probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/adobe-caslon/|Caslon
    Bold]], slant it, rework all serifs (to make them pointy and geometric, [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/latin+serif|latin
    serifs]]), redraw /T and add some swashes and flourishes (have a look to swashes
    and ornaments through Adobe Caslon Pro OpenType features)."

    on how you would reproduce the TTOB logo. I'm going to give it a shot.\r\nThe
    font still looks so familiar..."

  body: Don't think it's Cheltenham, even condensed. Some [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/caslon+condensed/fonts/|Caslon
    Condensed here]]. Another option would be to go with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/|Bookmania]]
    with tons of swashes and alternates. It could be a good font to base your work
    on (even if it looks far from your original sample).
