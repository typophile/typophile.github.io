body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nWe bought MetaOT and MetaSerifOT on behalf of a client from
  the good folks at FontShop. Our client uses PCs and executes their daily tasks using
  Microsoft Office applications such as Word. We followed the installation instructions
  on FontShop\u2019s website, so I\u2019m pretty sure both are installed correctly.\r\n\r\nThe
  issue we have is that our client has to go to the font menu each time they need
  to apply <em>italics</em>, <strong>bold</strong> and <strong><em>bold italics</em></strong>.
  They are not the type of client that would easily grasp the importance of this and,
  without doubt, will be hitting those italic/bold buttons to emphasise their text,
  resulting in faux italics/bold.\r\n\r\nMy question is this: is their a way that
  they can hit the italic/bold buttons and get the true MetaOT-Bold, MetaOT-Italic
  and MetaOT-BoldItalic?\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nTa.\r\nConor"

  body: "Those aren't faux bold and italic buttons. They're just buttons. If the typeface
    has the styles, and they are set up in the standard Windows fashion, the links
    will work fine from using the buttons, and they will get the true styles.\r\n\r\nIf
    the fonts are *not* properly style linked as they probably should be, there is
    nothing the client can do to change that.\r\n\r\nIf the Bold and Italic fonts
    show up separately in the font menu in Word, then they're not style linked. If
    they don't show up separately, then everything is presumably fine.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "In Word, you can add buttons to the Formatting toolbar (or any other toolbar)
    for any installed font. Right click anywhere in any toolbar and select <strong>Customize</strong>.
    Select the <strong>Command</strong> tab. In the <strong>Categories</strong> pane,
    scroll down to and select <strong>Fonts</strong>. In the <strong>Commands</strong>
    pane, you should see all your fonts. Click and hold the left mouse button on a
    font name, drag it to wherever you want it on the toolbar, and release the mouse
    button. \r\n\r\nWhile you're in the <strong>Customize</strong> dialog, you can
    also remove the Bold, Italic, and Underline buttons from the Formatting toolbar.
    Just click, hold, and drag the appropriate button well away from the toolbar area.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you close Word, you'll probably be prompted to save changes to the normal.dot
    template."

  body: Forgot to mention that if you don't want to mess with the existing toolbars,
    you can create a new toolbar (<strong>Customize > Toolbars > New</strong>), name
    it something like "Fonts," and drag your font buttons to that.

    you would do why? We're talking Windows here, where that would be nuts.\r\n\r\nUnless
    of course you <em>only</em> used wacky un-style-linked fonts. But as all the common
    Windows system fonts are style-linked, and so are the overwhelming majority of
    3rd party fonts, it seems unlikely....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I mentioned taking the standard bold, italic, and underline buttons off the
    Formatting toolbar in the very specific context of Conor's problem. Taking the
    buttons off the Formatting toolbar would prevent his client from creating "faux"
    Metaserif bold, italic, or bold italic and ensure that they have to use the buttons
    on the created-for-the-purpose "Font" toolbar. For the general 99.999999999% of
    Word users who aren't concerned about faux Metaserif bold or italic, of course
    there's no reason to take the buttons off the standard Formatting toolbar.

  body: "Right, but... my point is that presumably those are not the only fonts that
    person is using, so even though they're using MetaSerif, removing the buttons
    probably isn't a reasonable option.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I don't disagree with you, but as I said, I only <em>mentioned</em> it, not
    <em>recommended</em> it. Information is good, right?\r\n\r\nTwo other considerations:\r\n\r\n1.
    The buttons on the Format toolbar (or any toolbar) are only shortcuts. You can
    always format text using Ctrl-b, Ctrl-i, or Ctrl-u, or by going to Format > Font.\r\n\r\n2.
    Perhaps Meta is only used for a few specific kinds of documents, not everything.
    You can create a special template (e.g., \"meta.dot\") and store the customized
    toolbars in that. Normal.dot would have an untouched Format toolbar and no custom
    \"Font\" toolbar."
