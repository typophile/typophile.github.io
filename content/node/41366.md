body: "Reading about Bembo just now I came across a reference to the long R & short
  R in Metal Bembo from Monotype. Which got me wondering what other alternative glyphs
  or alternative glyph combinations there might have been. \r\n\r\nI know that Linotype
  had quite a few \"logotypes\" which were a mix of Kering solutions and ligatures
  (mainly f related but sometimes including much more ) and sometimes there were even
  contextual alteration of non ligature kerned logotypes. I found the contextual stuff
  at the Printing History Museum in North Andover. Here is some more info on that:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/36157
  \r\n\r\nMy questions are, if I wanted to see if similar things had been done with
  Monotype Metal fonts where would I look? Did Monotype use the Term \"logotype\"?
  What alternative characters do you know and or love?"

    knock-off, but were, say, writing a dissertation on Bembo) you''d get in contact
    with Robin Nicholas, and request an appointment to visit the Monotype UK office
    in Salfords. Robin, might then let you examine the original engineering drawings
    which would include the special sorts. '

    by an institution*. \r\n\r\nI will contact Robin. I don't think I will be able
    to visit between now & Typecon but maybe later. And maybe he has some ideas about
    this. Do you have his contact info? Would you send it to me by email?\r\n\r\nNice
    new avatar BTW! I really like the old one too.\r\n\r\n*This question is related
    to a talk I am probably going to give at Typecon about Text faces use of contextual
    shapes. From hand scripts to metal to digital and a shift in thinking I want to
    encourage. The Linotype examples are pretty great I think just because they show
    high craft within a very constrained situation and they support the idea that
    context specific shapes can be just as useful in text as they are in display.
    I feel like I have done a reasonable job with the metal Linotype but I haven't
    even looked at metal Monotype!\r\n\r\n  "

  body: "There's no need to go all the way back to the engineering drawings to see
    what special characters were available. If you can track down any copies of the
    specimen sheets or books that Monotype prepared for their customers, they'll usually
    show the special characters along with the part numbers that were used to order
    the correct matrices for any given typeface. For instance, here's a note from
    a specimen for Bembo Bold 428 (unfortunately I don't have the corresponding sheet
    for Series 270, the regular weight):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bembo_bold_alts_8pt_3673.gif]\r\n\r\nYou
    can see the alternate versions of R available, as well as a few additional ligatures.
    Granted, the drawings would make it easier to see what's been adjusted to make
    those ligatures, but the printed specimens I've seen have always had really clear
    printing.\r\n\r\n(That's 8 pt. type shown at 300%, in case you're wondering.)"

  body: Cool! It's interesting to see that they call the special letter combinations
    ligatures even if the don't visually touch. Are there special years that are better
    or worse to track down like there are for the ATF catalog?

  body: The later the better for any given form of the typeface (that is, the latest
    specimen of either the metal or the film version you can find), since any specials
    that were custom ordered by any customers would be added to the next round of
    updates. I'm not sure when the major sets of specimens were released, but I've
    mostly seen binders of specimens that allowed customers to insert the updated
    sheets as they were produced.

    quoting the comment by Beatrice Warde aka Paul Beaujon on the extra characters
    made by Linotype for Granjon in her piece on the \u2018Garamond\u2019 types in
    <em>Fleuron</em> 5:\r\n\r\n\u2018To offset the unfortunate inability of the Linotype
    to cast a kerned f, no fewer than twenty-six ligatures are provided. After such
    a sacrifice of practicality to beauty, it would be ungenerous of an author to
    mention Afghanistan, and so call out the \u2018button-hook\u2019 f that is the
    family spectre of Linotype designers.\u2019"

  body: "Eben --\r\n\r\nHave I mentioned the Spiral/Emerson contextual r to you before?
    It was part of Blumenthal's original foundry type, but didn't make it into the
    Monotype cutting of the face -- probably because they couldn't really accommodate
    it in the matrix case and there wasn't likely to be much interest in such a specialized
    sort as an extra.\r\n\r\nIf you can get your hands on a copy of the APHA's <cite>American
    Proprietary Typefaces,</cite> Jerry Kelly discusses this on page 115 in his article
    on Emerson.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    great. \r\n\r\nThanks James!\r\n\r\nI noticed recently that I have on example
    of what I was looking for in \"Finer Points in the Spacing & Arrangement of Type\"
    by Geoffrey Dowding. On page 72 is an image of ligatures and swashes for \"Monotype
    Garamond 156\". It's not bad - but I am not sure I see any special shapes that
    are not decorative - except for the ears on the double g. One is longer than the
    other - unless the repro isn't as hgood as I would like...\r\n\r\nAn interesting
    side note: He mentions that there was a ligature ( not completely in the sense
    we mean today) of the Word \"The\". There is no image of it however.\r\n\r\nAny
    suggestions for search strategies on Monotype Specimens in Libraries? So far I
    am not having luck. Maybe because they were in binders rather than being in bound
    books, they didn't make it into libraries. "

  body: "Another angle might be to identify some popular composing houses that used
    Monotype and look for their specimens. Major composing houses would periodically
    produce publications outlining the faces that they had on hand, often with extensive
    showings. Kingsport Press is one that comes to mind -- a three volume set: one
    for Linotype, one for Monotype, and one for Display faces.\r\n\r\nI've seen a
    few sets before, but I don't recall if they give full character showings in addition
    to the copious settings.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
