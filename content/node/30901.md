  forums for a while; I've just been too scared to post until now. In fact, I met
  many of you at TypeCon in Boston (I was a volunteer); you guys are like celebrities
  to me.\r\n\r\nWith that said, what inspired me to post was this logo for Milton
  Hospital. I just think that it's a brilliant design and deserved to be shared.\r\n\r\n-Scott[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Milton-Hospital-logo_5148.gif]"

  body: "Thanks, Tiffany. And just so you know, you're the one that inspired me to
    finally join Typophile because I thought of you the other day: At TypeCon I worked
    in the bookstore with you and I remember you remaking a sign because the kerning
    was off. The other day at work, I did the exact same thing. :)\r\n\r\n-Scott"
