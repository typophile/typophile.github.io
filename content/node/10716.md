  body: Hey Jennifer. It&#39;s not bad. <BR> <BR>If this font is an alteration of
    an existing design my first  <BR>suggestion is to be very careful if you wish
    to release  <BR>it to the public. <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/2927.html"

  body: Thank you. This type is a result of a project for class. My intent was to
    juxtapose classic letterforms with the effects of weathering. I find it interesting
    how rust works and that it is generally eating forms that were magestic and beautiful.
    Rust was the texture I was shooting for but I found it difficult to emulate.  <BR>
    <BR>I appreciate the warnings. I&#39;m fairly sure this won&#39;t be released
    for public use, it is merely my first attempt at type design. Is there anyway
    to work with what I have to make it more acceptable, or would I have to start
    from scratch? <BR> <BR>Jen <BR> <BR>

  body: Well, in any case it&#39;s best to give credit to the source. But if you&#39;re
    going to release it &#40;especially for money&#41;, then it gets trickier. Technically
    you might be OK &#40;like in the US it would be legal for you to work from a scan
    of the source&#41;, but it&#39;s not ethical unless the &#34;owner&#34; gives
    an OK. The owner might be the designer, or a client who&#39;s already paid for
    the original, or a bunch of other things. Some people even call for getting permission
    for anything at all &#40;even just opening up a digital font in Fontographer,
    believe it or not&#41;, but those people are fundamentalists - best simply ignored.
