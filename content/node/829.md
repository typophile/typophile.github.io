  body: Hehe.  No problem. I can&#39;t tell you how many times Jocham <BR>has been
    the name behind an excellent font no one can <BR>find. This guy has been around
    for a while, with a few faces <BR>in the E&#43;F library, and custom work for
    Details Magazine <BR>and other corps, but still, few people have heard of him.

    but when I do... Man o man, just a little wink  <BR>&#39;n&#39; nudge to remind
    us why you were appointed sheriff  <BR>of this mean ole&#39; little town. ;&#41;
    <BR> <BR>So, you speaking Swedish yet? =D

  body: Hubert Jocham&#39;s typefaces are very nice. Although Teleneue is not my favorite.
    I really like the one used for body text in Details Magazine. Which, by the way,
    has a nice layout too. :-&#41;
