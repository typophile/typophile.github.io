  body: "The last looks like something between <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/zocalo/?&sample_text=A%20bilidades%20imperiosa&update=0&affid=99346\">Z\xF3calo</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/electra_std_complete_pack/?&sample_text=A%20bilidades%20imperiosa&update=0&affid=99346\">Electra</a>.
    Is this from a magazine or newspaper? They often use custom typefaces."

    the print looks older than the publication of this type family."

  body: And I think the sans is <a href=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/PoynterGothicText/>Poynter
    Gothic Text</a>. FB (and H&FJ) are always safe bets for anything on newsprint.

  body: Reed - it looks like Quiosco and that was my first thought too, but is not.
    Perhaps an early or custom version. Many of Font Bureau's typefaces began as commissions
    and are then adjusted before retail release.

    My mistake! Reed is right."
