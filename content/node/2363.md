  body: Ihave looked at DaFont in about 4 categories, at ThemeWorld, and 1001 Fonts.
    The only thing that made my pupils dilate was a ripoff of  Excoffon&#39;s Choc,
    which at first resembled some of these characteristics. In other places RR&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=RR00007401P2" target="_blank">Hauser
    Script</a> was a bit similar, but you said you need identical. <BR> <BR>You may
    have to consider that this is a custom font. As I frequently tell people who want
    me to ID hand-lettered fonts that look like anyone&#39;s lettering &#40;not the
    work of a calligrapher or sign artist&#41;, these kinds of fonts are the easiest
    and cheapest kind to make,so an advertiser who wants a unique look can spend less
    than $50 and have a font made of any sample lettering. If this is from a commercial
    advertiser&#39;s promo material, that may be exactly what you are dealing with,
    I&#39;m afraid.
