body: "I'm currently designing a website featuring a centred type layout, and I'm
  looking for a serif typeface that fulfils some rather specific criteria.\r\n\r\nThe
  application is a list of projects, each with a year value (i.e. Project name 1965\u20141967).
  The type is set at 40 pixels in size (equivalent to 40pt size at 100% in InDesign).\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking to use a display serif with old-style figures, which is available to license
  as a web font (ideally through an @fontface service). Manually kerning the numerals
  is beyond the scope of the project (since the number values are generated dynamically
  by a CMS) and as such I need a serif typeface with kerned Old style figures.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone is aware of any options that fill the above criteria, I'd be much obliged
  if you could point me in the right direction."

    for is fonts with proportional old-style \uFB01gures as default.\r\nMy Pratt and
    Richler \uFB01t the bill. (They are also kerned where appropriate.)\r\nAvailable
    at MyFonts, FontSpring, WebINK and FontShop."
