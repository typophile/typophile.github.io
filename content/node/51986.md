  while the Hathaway one is on the tip of my tongue, I think I'm stumped on both.\r\n\r\n[[http://i141.photobucket.com/albums/r43/GibbGibbGibb/1.jpg|Here's
  one.]]\r\n[[http://i141.photobucket.com/albums/r43/GibbGibbGibb/2.jpg|Here's two.]]\r\n\r\nIf
  anybody has any leads on these, it would be much appreciated. Here's hoping the
  links post correctly...\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

    one. (The aforementioned Hathaway ad.)

    not giving us much to work with on #2 -- got anything less blurry?"

  body: Hmm... Maybe it's [[http://www.faces.co.uk/fonts/Dennis-Ortiz-Lopez/Contact-Bold-Condensed-DL10105/|Contact
    Bold Condensed]]. Close, right?

  body: "Nah, I don't think Contact is particularly close. #2 has the square proportions
    of something like Melior:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/melior_std_bold/\r\n\r\nBut
    the funkiness of the tail of the y suggests this may be one of the display fonts
    from the 70s that hasn't (yet) made the transition to digital.\r\n\r\nWe need
    Mark Simonson's input on this one..."

    it, then it's an awfully close approximation - I certainly can't tell the difference.
    Thanks a lot for the tip."
