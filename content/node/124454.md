body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nI'm writing my master's thesis in geology and I need some tips
  for formatting.\r\nThere are no restrictions at my university for style only that
  it must be printed one sided pages.\r\n(I learn using InDesign and I already read
  many articles about thesis style on the web.)\r\n\r\nI decided to use Palatino Linotype
  for the Text Body and FF DIN Pro Bold and Light italic for the headings.\r\n\r\nI
  don't know what margins and line spacing should I use for the text to look proportional
  and be easily readable. On the left side there should be a gutter of 1 cm, and there
  won't be any footnotes just a page number.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!\r\n\r\nP.S.:
  Maybe it's not the most important thing to design a thesis I just like doing it.
  I feel that the work of my last 2 years should look professional in every way."

  body: "I'm not familiar with LaTex, but thanks. I started to use InDesign for fun,
    and because I want to learn it but that's not exactly related to the issue. I'm
    only asking these things because I'm not very familiar with page layouts in typography
    yet.\r\n\r\nSo my original questions: What line spacing and margin do you think
    works well with Palatino Linotype, if only one sided pages are used. There are
    two levels of heading and figures every 3-4 pages that take 1/2\u20131/4 of the
    page.\r\nAs for the margins I tried top: 2cm, bottom: 3.2cm, right:2cm, left:4.2cm
    so the written text snaps to a golden ratio grid.\r\nAm I on a good path? I can't
    decide between a line spacing of 1.5 or 1.25 (1 looks too crowded and I find it
    hard to read for 40 pages).\r\n \r\nThanks!"

  body: "If you already have enough text to fill two facing pages, I suggest to play
    around with different settings. From past experience, seeing the print will give
    you a much better idea than going by numbers. The line spacing will also determine
    the text block size: tighter spacing, smaller block; and then the text block size
    can be placed differently depending on header and footer and folios. \r\n\r\nIf
    12pt is not negotiable, then this already decides the line measure (characters
    per line) which should be about 2 alphabets.\r\n\r\nBottom line, there are many
    different factors and personal taste at play here. Print them out and let your
    personal feel and taste guide you :-) When you found something, perhaps post it
    here and then people can discuss tweaks and improvements."

  body: "If you're familiar with [[http://www.latex-project.org/|LaTeX]] then that's
    a good point to start setting your thesis with. With LaTeX you can specify a few
    parameters like margins and then your layout class will compute the rest for you.
    Perhaps take a look [[http://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2013/08/02/thesis-series-pt1.html|here]].
    (I used the [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script|KOMA book]] LaTeX package to
    set my thesis.)\r\n\r\nOther than that, if you want to use inDesign (why?) then
    what parameters do you have? Paper size? How many levels of heading? Illustrations,
    tables?"
