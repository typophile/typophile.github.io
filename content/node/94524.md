body: Hi, fellas. I need some help in translating comic books. I'm translate original
  comics to russian and I can't find some fonts (maybe this activity slightly illegal,
  but it's only way to bring comics' culture to the russian readers because comics
  aren't printed in Russia). Please help and sorry for my english [img:sites/default/files/old-images/marvel-zombies-destroy-01-182323_5235.jpg]
