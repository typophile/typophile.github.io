  casting metal type after TypeCon. They are here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/sets/72157601705177162/\r\n\r\nHere's
  a sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chip_6484.sm.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  'a' is from the monospace I had critiqued at TypeCon.\r\n\r\nI found the experience
  fascinating. All the materials awareness is amazing. The wrong brass. Your done.
  Wrong mix of Lead, Tin & Antimony. It's over. Done. It goes on & on. There are so
  many ways to go wrong. It really shows you what was involved in getting superior
  printing. The machines themselves are amazing too. They are hugely precise - to
  the thickness of cigarette paper, 1/1000th of an inch. And Jim was a very very nice
  guy. \r\n\r\nThanks again Jim! \r\n\r\nHere's hoping you will be at TypeCon in Buffalo."

    of letterpress workshops at past editions of TypeCon and thoroughly enjoyed the
    experience of setting small blocks of metal and wood type."
