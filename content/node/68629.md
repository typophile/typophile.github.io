body: "I've a sneaking suspicion that this has been raised before elsewhere, but hey...\r\nWe've
  got articles on the web that mainly use Verdana, but which switch to a style whose
  font stack starts with Arial Unicode for strings that contain (relatively) obscure
  characters. Up pops a name like \"\u015E Erdo\u011Fmu\u015F\", and the name displays
  wrongly. Looking at the code (in Courier!) it looks fine... printing it out (the
  print style sheet uses Georgia) it looks fine. On screen (with the style sheet that's
  using Arial Unicode), we get s-comma instead of s-cedilla. Whassup with Arial Unicode
  here? 015E and 015F should be clear and separate from 0218 and 0219 shouldn't they?
  Is this a designer mistake?"

    our web team is <em>not</em> to switch to that alternative style for this name!

  body: Sounds like a substitution for local language. Is this a Moldavian/Romanian
    issue? You might post this in the "Build" area where the proper folks roam who
    can answer.

  body: "Hmm, well I know 0218 and 0219 are for Romanian (I have a Romanian sitting
    opposite me now) but amidst a list of international names (in an article reference
    list!) I think this guy's most likely Turkish...\r\nIf you reckon re-posting in
    \"Build\" might get me my best responses, I'll try that a bit later (I'll leave
    it a while here first to see if anybody else pipes up). Cheers Chris."
