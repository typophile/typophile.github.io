  which is somewhat more up-to-date than the one included with FontLab. To save others
  from some some rather mindless and laborious typing I thought I'd upload it here.
  I make no guarantees that it is complete -- just that it is more complete than the
  one which is included with FontLab. I also make no guarantees that it is 100% error
  free.\r\n\r\nTo use, just change the extension from .txt to .dat (the .txt sufffix
  was necessary to to overcome forum rules on attachments) and place it in ~Library/Application
  Support/FontLab/Data.\r\n\r\nI assume this will also work for PCs, but have no idea
  where it needs to be stored on a PC.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
