body: "One of the designers here at Megacorp has created outlines for a new font based
  on a free font that Roger White posted on his [[http://www.rogersfonts.org.uk/index.html|website]].
  I have e-mailed Roger but received no reply. Perhaps it's the futbol? Is England
  closed? Roger lists a snail mail address as: 1, Owens Close, Rugeley, Staffs, WS15
  2YH. U.K \r\n\r\nIf anyone reading this message knows Roger White and how to get
  in touch with him, please let me know. I can be reached at my work e-mail kristin(dot)dooley
  (at) target.com.\r\n\r\nI've tried contacting Roger at the e-mail address indicated
  on the website and in the EULA for permission to use the font commercially. I've
  also asked permission to pay for and alter the outlines (the existing EULA expressly
  forbids this).  We are willing to do the font work ourselves and pay a fair price
  for his original outlines. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nKristin\r\n\r\n"

  body: His homepage states "Despite what is said in the readme files associated with
    the fonts all fonts on this site are now public domain, whether used for personal
    use or for commercial purposes." Fonts in the public domain can be altered and
    copied in any way you want. I don't think you need to find him to do what you
    are doing.

    don\u2019t question that? Because it would be so convenient?\r\n\r\nThe legality
    and, what is much more important, the originality and quality of Roger White\u2019s
    fonts have been disproved here before, read through these threads:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/30593\">Roger's

  body: "Thanks, Florian. I missed those threads. I should have done a search on this
    site before asking.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can find the original source of the outlines
    we want to use. Heading over to the Type ID board now.\r\n\r\nKristin"
