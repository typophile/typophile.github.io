  lists, they indent on the right side and don't line up with the rest of the left
  justified content (loosing precious space).\r\n\r\nWhen I right click (on a PC)
  and choose \"clear all overrides\", the problem is resolved, however the text is
  all befuddled and must be reformatted (font, size, and color)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  as to what is causing this problem?  I would like to deal with this issue without
  reformatting the entire document.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The settings for \"Indents and Spacing\" can be changed in the Paragraph
    panel. Your description is a bit unclear, but I think it would suffice to select
    the indenting paragraphs and set their left/right/first line/last line values
    to zero. Do this for each occurrence.\r\n\r\nNormally I'd recommend changing this
    in the paragraph style for your lists, but judging by your 'clear overrides' problem,
    these haven't been used. If you (or original file creator) had used styles, you'd
    only had to change it once."

    styles!  \r\n\r\nAs a note: the Paragraph panel didn't show a problem and no unseen
    graphics were making the text wrap.\r\n\r\n"
