  typeface is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans/|Nimbus Sans]]. \r\n\r\nCan
  anybody recommend a \"browser-safe\" font that resembles Nimbus Sans? It should
  work in all modern browsers, on a PC as well as a Mac. I've tried a few ones, Trebuchet,
  Arial, Geneva, but I'm not sure which one is the best option.\r\n\r\nCan anybody
  help? Thanks for any input...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Arial\r\n\r\nthat way you catch Win and Mac users.\r\n"

  body: Nimbus Sans IS URW's version of Helvetica. And one of the better Helveticas
    around.

    familiar with URW Nimbus Sans of 15 years ago and it was absolutely the best Helvetica
    you could get.\r\n\r\nBut since I don't buy any type anymore, what do I know!"
