    be a variant of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-smokler/\">OL-Smokler

    Ortiz-Lopez, is irrelevant. It's the upper-case glyphs you want.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid

  body: Why do you ask that question? In your profile is your web address vetteletters.nl.
    Is this a kind of selfpromotion? Or a test for typophilers ;-)

    and that he wants to know if we know the origins of the species.\r\n\r\nBTW Nice
    fonts Donald."

  body: "Exactly Jos! I found them on rare places, but i would like to know the original
    names and designers... vetteletters.nl is my site (not finished yet), but this
    post is not for self promotion. So if anyone got some ideas about the origin of
    these fonts please let me know\r\nTnx, Donald"

    of Lex and asked me, "what the hell ..." But back to topic: I dont''t know the
    name of the original typefaces you are loooking for, but Kadetje, the first one
    looks very nice, I like the lowercase g.'
