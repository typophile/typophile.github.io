body: "i found this lovely typeface used for a project by Marc&Anna... I really like
  the solid form of the 'r'. however i think i read somewhere that its actually a
  custom font, but it seems familiar to others i've seen, but can't name them....
  can anyone suggest similars? \r\n\r\nTo see more of the font being used in this
  project head to their site;\r\n\r\nhttp://www.marcandanna.co.uk/work/176-gallery"

  body: "Also [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/banque-gothique-rr/medium-extra-condensed/|Banque
    Gothique Extra Condensed]] would be close, if you stretch it vertically.\r\n\r\nThe
    N is the non-typical aspect, and could easily be modified, for this and my previous
    choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi there, I noticed this thread link to our website so thought I'd help out.\r\n\r\nThe
    font is called Bourgeois and was designed by Jonathan Barnbrook \u2013 I'd love
    to say that we customised it, but we didn't have time in the end! This version
    is the Bold Condensed. Not hugely keen on the lower case, but the uppercase is
    nice and rigid. Hope that helps.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/virusfonts/bourgeois/"

    and I'm sure they'll help you out\" but they're already on the case. See, they
    are nice people.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
