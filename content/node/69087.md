  [[Arabic]] typography. this is my first post in this interest group.\r\nI'm designing
  [[nastaliq]] and badr fonts. i have some problems with [[kashida]] (tatweel) appeared
  automatically when justifying; especially with MS Word some other famous fonts have
  same problem (font of image is Scheherazade):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tatweel_5071.JPG]\r\nHow
  can i prevent? should i use cswh?\r\n"

  body: Ack! If software is doing this, then that's a bug in the software kashida
    insertion logic. It isn't something you can fix at the font level. You need to
    report this problem to the software maker.

  body: "?!?\r\nI thought Tatweel Insertion, is a specific algorithm designed by unicode,
    like as bi-directional algorithm. isn't?\r\nso, if Microsoft office Word 2007
    don't implement a correct algorithm, do you know another typesetting system do?
    i don't know anything about TeX based Arabic systems, but i'm pretty sure that
    XePersian justifies text by adding more space between words.\r\nAnother way: is
    OpenType Turing-Complete or Turing-Consistent? \r\nfor example in this situation
    control follow of text rendering engine (used with Justification algorithm) can
    be fall into an infinite loop:\r\n<code>Liga: semiLam tatweel semiAlif -> semiLam
    semiAlif</code>\r\nand again in the Justification algorithm:\r\n<code>Justify:
    semiLam semiAlif -> semiLam tatweel semiAlif</code>\r\nwhat will happen?"

  body: "As far as I know, tatweel insertion is not a Unicode algorithm, since it
    is a page layout feature not a plain text requirement.\r\n\r\nThe middle East
    version of InDesign supports quite good tatweel justification using its 'Naskh'
    justification setting.\r\n\r\n<em>what will happen?</em>\r\n\r\nThe problem is
    that justification typically takes place by inserting a tatweel character (in
    a buffered state, not affecting the underlying text string) <em>after</em> glyph
    processing is complete, because that is the stage at which the page layout app
    knows how long the unjustified lines are and hence how much to widen them. This
    results in a couple of problems: one is that automatically inserted tatweels are
    outside glyph processing and hence won't be processed as part of GSUB or GPOS
    lookups; the other is that their use is effectively limited to flat styles of
    Arabic type, since curved elongations typical of all the traditional styles except
    Kufic require GSUB and GPOS handling. [I am meeting with some people from the
    MS Office team this coming week to discuss this limitation and look at ways in
    which it might be overcome.]\r\n\r\nNote that if tatweel characters are manually
    inserted in the text string, then they will be processed during text shaping.
    Only automatically inserted tatweels will not.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that your
    illustration shows Scheherazade, which does not use ligature glyphs but, rather,
    employs contextual substitution to render even the lam+alif form wth two glyphs.
    My guess is that because the tatweel insertion takes place after text shaping,
    Word will not normally insert a tatweel within a ligature (in the process ignoring
    some situations in which an elongation might legitimately occur), but they might
    be assuming that lam+alif will always be rendered using a ligature, which is an
    erroneous assumption as Scheherazade demonstrates. If their algorithm permits
    an elongation following a lam, but doesn't take into account the possibility that
    lam+alif might be represented by two separate glyphs, then that would produce
    the result you show."

  body: "I see.\r\n\r\nTatweel insertion algorithm of Word 2007 (and earlier versions)
    is published with them and cannot be modified. so, in order to maintain consistence
    with that versions, do you think designers are fated to use ligatures instead
    of contextual substitution? it could be a little boring :-)\r\n\r\nI design ALL
    of my Alifs and Lams by contextual sub, so write a python macro for making them
    composed by AlifLam ligature (+and additional marks) to make changes easy. but

  body: "I met with some MS Office and shaping engine developers this week. There's
    general acknowledgement that kashida insertion is very buggy and needs to be improved.
    I'm working on this with them now, but my guess is that it will be a long time
    before improvements are coded, tested and rolled into shipping software.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    using ligatures doesn't really help much, because in some situations the kashida
    insertion loging will try to put a kashida between two letters that are ligated,
    but Word loses track of the relationship of glyphs to characters and the kashida
    is displayed after the ligature:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/morekashidaproblems_4523.gif]\r\n\r\nFor
    now, my advice to users is simply not to use kashida justification at all."

    Office 2013. \r\n\r\nIs there a known solution? Something I should implement in
    Scheherazade?\r\n\r\nI also note that with the Amiri font Word seems to do only
    white-space justification. Amiri implements lam-alef as separate glyphs like Scheherazade,
    but something in the logic seems to prevent Word from inserting kashidas."
