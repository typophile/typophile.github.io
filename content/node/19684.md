    another wonderful face- will most likely not be coming to the market... I hope
    he changes his mind.

  body: "Well done Kris. I am glad to see we can now start to get hold of some of
    these great faces which we have only been able to admire on your site(s) up until
    now. As a fellow kiwi and someone who studied with Kris not so long ago it is
    fantastic to see a new NZ type designer (and one I have had the pleasure of knowing)
    breaking into the international market. Keep going mate, I look forward to owning
    some of your faces in the not too distant future.\r\n\r\n-nic"
