body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nLooking to get some feedback on a logo I've been working on.
  The company is called Edible Adventures - Mobile cooking classes for kids. It's
  pretty self explanatory. Client is looking for a simple execution of her logo. It
  has to communicate food in a fun way and easy to read. Could be used as signage
  on vans/store front/stationary/marketing materials. \r\n\r\nPlease take a few minutes
  to look it over. Let me know your thoughts/suggestions. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.

    about the two bite count but seemed unbalanced. i had originally bit the 'e' and
    the 's'. seemed off. i'll look at it again. \r\n\r\nthanks. "

  body: "I had the same through hrant did, I think the bites are a bit overdone. Your
    bite on the \"v\" seems a hair awkward as well, it just sort of shortens the letter
    and I think will get lost as a \"bite\" as smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nI really like
    the overall feel, but I think there's be a bigger impact with less chewing. Maybe
    even just one bite? \"Edible\" already clearly implies eating and probably doesn't
    need one. Just thinking out loud :)"

  body: "I agree on fewer bites. Also, do you need the drop shadow? Not sure what
    it adds.\r\n\r\nThe alignment of the subline seems a bit coincidental? It might
    also be a bit small, depending on target size/application of this. Did you try
    using a secondary font that's less loud for the subline, which could also allow
    for it to be subordinate without being tiny?\r\n\r\nBTW, how about a few crumbs
    lying around, from the nibbling?* I'd think adventurously eating kids don't leave
    clean white space\u2026 :-)  But maybe that's too much.\r\n(* Maybe those could
    click with the subline in some way, size-/placement-wise.)\r\n\r\nEdit: Cross-posted,
    this post is in response to the first version."

  body: definitely much stronger with crumbs, i'd say that element is essential. I
    almost didn't notice the bites at first glance on the original version.

  body: Have you considered having only one bite that covers both lines ? E.g. the
    /e/ of the first line and /ntu/ of the second. Or move "edible" to the right a
    bit and bite from the left end.

  body: I agree on the subline comment... An italic might be better indeed & maybe
    the rotating angle doesn't have to be the exact same as the logo (I might try
    a less rotated -if even rotated at all- subline)... It's for kids, so ok to go
    a little nuts & colour outside the lines ;-)

  body: "If the angles are slightly off it will just look wrong; and if the subline
    font isn't going to be the same, chances are very small the angles will match.
    Fortunately you can find something close and then skew it slightly to match. Or
    you could use a really \"loose\" font with no discernible inclination angle, like
    a handwriting font* or maybe a flamboyant cursive.\r\n\r\n* Maybe this: http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/4305557811\r\n\r\nMore:\r\n-
    If you could -nicely- chop the head of the \"t\" in \"adventures\", you would
    end up with a nice tight fit between the two lines.\r\n- You need to work on the
    spacing, especially in \"adventures\". I might even make a custom \"v\" (a roundish
    form) to fill its space better.\r\n- The crumbs are spaced a bit too regularly.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I once applied this nibbling decoration to some type for a rat and mice killing
    product i branded, so it has a slightly different connotations to me than the
    rest. The choice of typography is excellent tho and really portrays the fun and
    playfulness well.

  body: "I think you should look at how the S is affected by the bite. The lower left
    of the S now only connects to the main part of the character with a very tiny
    slice. Perhaps you could try keeping this connecting strip a bit thicker, or try
    what happens if you completely let the lower left terminal 'snip off', so to speak.
    Perhaps rotate the bite by a few degrees counter-clockwise so the lower left bit
    of the S doesn't become to small, either.\r\n\r\nI'd probably also slightly nudge
    'edible' to the right, so the space between the ascender of the d in 'adventures'
    and the e of 'edible' isn't so tight.\r\n\r\nAnd I was also going to suggest chopping
    off the top of the t, as hrant already mentioned."
