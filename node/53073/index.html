		<div class="commentbody">I've personally never understood why the OSF zero must be <em>that</em> circular and unstressed.* The contrast to the other letters/numerals often seems overly emphasized, and I must admit it really bothers me in FF Reminga too. I'm with James on this: How often is the reader really prone to confuse 0 and o – and does this justify the <em>huge</em> contrast that sets the zero apart from the <em>entire rest</em> of a typeface like this one? (I feel it makes the zero look like a very special symbol; not like a numeral.)

That said, considering your point #1, Nick, I'd probably use lining figures for headlines anyway. It depends on the face, though, and of course on the application. I also like those 'hybrid' numerals that are kind of halfway OSFs. (Is there a more sensical name for those?)

* In fact, this was among my first big typographic enigmas in my childhood reading days, along with the "ft" ligature in some text faces that looks like a wonky A, and the bicameral g's that I thought were dingbats for glasses.</div>

Incidentally, I believe that in the beginning, it was. That's why the earliest forms of typographic zero are the contrastless circle. The advent of the concept of zero was a remarkable development in mathematics. Zero is magical, and in fact not like other numerals.

That said, I'm certainly not a fan of the OSF zero in Reminga Bold.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">My Neoritmo design is based entirely on this idea of having some key letters unstressed, others modulated, and a few a combination of the two. Inspiration came in part from the lighter weights of the typeface Stempel Schneidler (where the [O] and [Q] are almost monotonal).

To obtain a satisfacory balance in such a design idea has been very difficult, since the number of monotonal letters needs to be limited, and well-balanced, and of course in some languages this may prove more or less 'disturbing'.

I recall the monotonal zero in text types used to puzzle me, but then I came to really enjoy it, since I put a lot of importance on numerals, and I am fascinated by them, and most of those things, if well done, go completely unnoticed by the average reader.

EDIT: An "alpha" of Neoritmo (including a preliminary Greek version) can be seen in the [[http://www.benaki.gr/index.asp?lang=en|Benaki Museum]] website's headings (click on any section to see).</div>

Although I think that lining figures are more appropriate for headlines, I am nonetheless keeping old-style figures as the default for all optical sizes, to avoid user-confusion.</div>

What do you mean Tiffany?
As Mark and Jean-François said, they work better in the book weight, since they were born in that form.
They also work best in text sizes.
Here's how the weight is distributed in Neoritmo Bold. Still to be a little fixed, since most of it dates back to 1996:

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, I understand what you mean…
Yes, using the same form for the oldstyle zero and the [o] may be problematic, but in general if you have to set numeric strings (codes, etc.), you set them in lining figures.

There is also to say we have alphabets (like Futura) which use almost the same form for [l], [I], or Gill Sans which uses similar forms for [l], [I], [1], and in Futura the repetitive sequence of "circles" produces way more problem than this “zero" ambiguity, to me, even on simple formal terms…

But Futura happened at the right time, so we got used to it, and forms and things gets adopted by our decisions…

@Chris: yes, in Neoritmo it was the basis of the design, so – particular as it may be – the overall consistency makes the [0] look less "chosen" just to differentiate.
An interesting example is Frank Heine's Tribute, where different modulation choices are made all over the letter range. If he avoided some excessive forms (like [g]) it would be great as a text face.</div>
