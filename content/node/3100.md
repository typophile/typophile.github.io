  body: 'Wow, very nice! <BR>- E: unbalanced, top arm should be slightly shorter;
    <BR>- F: the bar is too high; <BR>- H: narrow; <BR>- S/s: the middle looks too
    thin, and the bottom serif is too light; <BR>- e: light; <BR>- y: tail is weak;
    <BR>- dieresis: heavy. <BR> <BR>Excellent work, Rodrigo. <BR>Saludos!'

  body: 'This is indeed nice. <BR> <BR>I like all the detail you have put into it
    with the traps and attention to consistency. I agree with eduardo. <BR> <BR>I
    addition, I might focus my attention of the figures. Generally the color should
    fit somewhere between the caps and lower case. <BR> <BR>2: Modulation is wierd.
    <BR>3: Modulation issues coming out of the waist &#40;too thick too quick&#41;
    <BR>5: Modulation also odd. More horizontal emphaisis in the waist? <BR>7: Light.
    Add some more to the taper at the bottom. <BR>0: Dark. <BR>1: Also, maybe a hair
    dark. <BR> <BR>fi: The terminal on the f is too much like a circle and doesn&#39;t
    flow naturally from the stem. <BR> <BR>Well done! '

  body: 'One other comment: <BR> <BR>The rounded head serifs and the sharp foot serifs
    seem to clash a bit &#40;see the n&#41;. Consider slightly bracketing the foot
    serifs. <BR> <BR>R'

  body: 'Pretty nice! And complex. <BR> <BR>You have a lot of variety in the serifs.
    Keep that divergence, but I think it needs a little bit of taming, like in the
    &#34;j&#34; I&#39;d use the round/flat style &#40;like in the &#34;f&#34;&#41;
    instead. The only glyphs that really don&#39;t work for me are the &#34;k&#34;
    &#40;you need to terminate the leg much stronger&#41; and the &#34;y&#34; &#40;new
    tail&#41;. The &#34;g&#34; is great! <BR> <BR>The caps are really classy - nice
    going. The &#34;3&#34; needs weight. Your &#34;fi&#34;/&#34;fl&#34; ligs seem
    forced. <BR> <BR>Trapping is great, but it needs to be made consistent. Use Flower
    Power! <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html" target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>BTW, your weight is slightly heavy for typical text. But your vertical
    proportions are great. <BR> <BR>Spacing: needs work, and is a hair loose overall
    &#40;at least at that weight&#41;. <BR> <BR>This is a very promising design -
    I hope you take it all the way! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Hi Rodrigo <BR> <BR>I like this serif! <BR> <BR>Here my critique <BR>Many
    of this is a question of flaver ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>lc &#39;a&#39;: Downstrok-serif
    is very heavy <BR> <BR>The angel of the dick/thin contrast seams to be very different.
    I like it in lc &#39;e&#39; and &#39;c&#39; but i.e. lc &#39;o&#39; or lc &#39;g&#39;
    has another angel. Also the Uppercase... but maybe u have to fix the  lc &#39;e&#39;
    and lc &#39;c&#39;. But as i just said I like the e and c more ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>lc
    &#39;y&#39;: like eduardo said to weak and I also agree to the to heavy dieresis
    <BR> <BR>Also you should check the horizental lines. It seams that there are  many
    diffrences. <BR> <BR>Also check the lc &#39;g&#39;. The h-lines seams also different
    weight. <BR> <BR>The Tail of the Q should end like the upstroke serif of the lc
    &#39;g&#39; <BR> <BR>Greetings to you and go on! <BR>Jens'
