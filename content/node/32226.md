  dividing fonts in sets, \r\nbeside regular serif and sans divison.\r\n\r\nI tought
  dividing it to classical ones ( helvetica, frutiger, univers... for example) and
  modern ones...\r\n\r\nAnyone have advice and share with us their Suitcase name and
  way of organizing and naming sets.\r\n\r\nTHANKS."

  body: "Hi gardenize,\r\n\r\nOur corporation uses Suitcase. Our experience has been
    that the less fonts loaded in Suitcase, the better. \r\n\r\nWe create our sets
    by project. For instance, when I'm working on a brochure, I create a folder on
    my hard drive that contains only the fonts used in the brochure and name the folder:
    brochure fonts. I load that folder into Suitcase, where it becomes a set, and
    activate it while I'm working on the brochure. When I'm done, I pull the set out
    and Suitcase is empty (except for system fonts) again.\r\n\r\nThe advantage to
    this method is that all fonts must be deliberately added to a project, rather
    than automatically opening via Suitcase. This may not be a preferred method for
    your organization.\r\n\r\nKristin"

  body: "I use Font Explorer but it must be similar. My sets are:\r\n\r\nantique/distressed\r\ncalligraphic/uncial\r\nclassic
    serif w/expert\r\ncondensed - this is both for sans and serif fonts\r\ncool (this
    one is way subjective!)\r\ndingbats\r\ndisplay/initial caps\r\nfunny\r\ngrunge\r\nhandwriting\r\nnouveau/deco\r\nretro
    (mostly 50s style here)\r\nsans\r\nscript\r\nslab\r\ntechno\r\n\r\nI also have
    a few sets for foundries. But my basic purpose for sets is to browse the categories.
    Unlike Kristin, I keep all my fonts loaded in Font Explorer so having the sets
    avoids my needing to scroll thru literally thousands of fonts to find something
    that grabs me. It took awhile to set all this up but then it's a snap to maintain
    - when I add a new font I just dump it into the relevant category(s).\r\n\r\nI
    used to create job or project sets, but since Font Explorer activates automatically
    when you open a file, that doesn't seem necessary anymore."

  body: Sandro, the history of writing has still to be written, you are aware of that,
    you are not "new to a program," you are new to typography, which is a wonderful
    thing, and the reason why Typophile exists, I think.

  body: ":). I not new to typography. I am new to the program. I am in search of useful
    and fast use of typesets. So apart from regular serif, sans, I think of other
    way of making and using sets efficiently, for example  how much I am using some
    particular font ( gotham, din for example), then for example classics (including
    both serifs and sans - garamond and    \r\nhelvetica for example - historical
    value of course), somethin modern or something like that...\r\n\r\nOf course study
    of any new particular work is essential, \r\n\r\n"

  body: Okay, sorry, I have never used Suitcase, I suppose it is easy then to create
    subsets/groups of font files to activate/deactivate based on job, Vox, Novarese,
    foundry, color, script style, &c.
