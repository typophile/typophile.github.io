  on websites but would like to know the ins and outs. Copyright issues?  Done some
  research and there's FLIR and sIFR, but I don't want to go down this route, as its
  (sIFR) flash dependent and seems Flash is going down the pan\r\n\r\nAlso have checked
  out Squarespace.com. They have the licensing sorted it seems but their library is
  limited IMO.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

  body: "Using @font-face is the best method and requires neither Flash nor Javascript.
    There seems to be two main approaches: Renting typefaces located on a remote server
    and buying typefaces to have on your own server. \r\n\r\nSome places to start
    looking: [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/n/web_fontfonts/|Fontshop]], [[http://www.typotheque.com/webfonts|Typotheque]],
    [[http://typekit.com/|Typekit]], [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator|Fontsquirrel]],
    [[http://code.google.com/webfonts|Google Fonts]], [[http://www.motaitalic.com/|Mota
    Italic]], [[http://justanotherfoundry.com/webfonts|JAF]], [[http://webfonts.info/wiki/index.php?title=Fonts_available_for_%40font-face_embedding|Webfonts.info]]
    + [[http://webfonts.info/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Webfont_Services|this]],
    [[http://www.ascendercorp.com/info/web-fonts/|Ascender]], [[http://fontdeck.com/|Fontdeck]]
    and [[http://kernest.com/|Kernest]].\r\n\r\nAlso a google search for \"site:typophile.com
    @font-face\" or \"site:typophile.com web fonts\" will turn up a lot of information.
    \r\n\r\nYou should pay special attention to rendering on different platforms/browsers,
    as this can vary. Most of the free fonts and even a lot of the \u201Cprofessional\u201D
    ones are not up to speed on this."

  body: "Also, if you host the fonts yourself, you'll need to host multiple formats
    for different browsers (at least EOT and TTF, possibly WOFF and/or SVG as well),
    and get the coding straight to do that seamlessly. It can be done, just takes
    a bit of research and potentially converting formats. You'll also want to be sure
    that the license terms permit the font formats you need.\r\n\r\nFor the \"renting
    typefaces\" approach, I might also suggest you look at our service: <a href=\"http://webink.com\">WebINK</a>
    from Extensis.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
