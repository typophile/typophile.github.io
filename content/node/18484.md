body: "Hi Typophiles\r\n\r\nI posted a thread before about some letterpress inspiration
  for my wedding invites. Here I am with this thing again but this time I\u2019m posting
  a sample of the invite. I\u2019m struggling a lot with this one and changed my typefaces
  quite a lot.\r\nI first started buying \u201CEmily\u201D from t26 because I liked
  the look of that font but when I put it together it didn\u2019t really pair well
  with other typefaces. So I moved on to traditional scripts like Brickhamm and others
  but I\u2019ve seen this face used in so many invites (not that it\u2019s a bad thing)
  but I wanted something a bit different.\r\nThe reason why I went with what I have
  is because I was looking for a meaning to all of this and find out that this day
  in which the wedding is taken (20th) in relation to the 20th day of every month
  in the Aztec calendar was \u201Cxochitl\u201D which stands for flower and its supposed
  to be good for spiritual related things. So I did my research on Aztec flowers and
  find a book called \u201CAncient Mexican Designs\u201D that has a lot of this \u201Cxochitl\u201D
  flowers.\r\nAnyway not to go any deeper I really didn\u2019t wanted to be so nationalist
  with this project so I made my own designs based on the flowers I saw and created
  my own calligraphy to give it a more human touch.\r\nInitially I wanted to have
  flowers cropping off the edges but was just too crowded. Our parent names have also
  been a pain since I can\u2019t get away from setting them one next to the other.
  I also tried justifying text to the left and also different alignments but it\u2019s
  just being crazy. So to fit all this text I went with small caps spaced out and
  justified text. The text face is FF Clifford, I\u2019ve also played around with
  Filosofia and Mrs. Eaves.\r\n\r\nThis is of course going to be letterpressed\r\n\r\nAny
  crit would be gladly accepted and hope you all have fun doing it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nkco\r\n"

  body: "Typographically, the face choice is nice. But to make it really awesome use
    a more humanistic means. Is one shy than the other? Taller? Use this kind of expression
    in your calligraphy. They both dont have to be the same.\r\nNot a fan of the rest
    of the txt. Needs a lot of composition works. Your hierarchy is off. You need
    to work with scale more but keep it subtle because its still a formal subject.
    I would lose the ALL CAPS. To  me thats very annoying for a body copy. Change
    your page format too from the standard 8.5x11-ish look. Experiment a bit more
    with the way a page opens and information is read. Do you have to repeat \"AA\"
    again at the top?\r\nAnd I dont think the vectorized flower is doing anything
    for me, scale wise (very robotic looking flower). Scale that down and try hand-drawing
    it in as supposed to a digital medium. Colors are nice."

  body: "Ok i can see it now (sorry i am a bit of a novice) Wow Prakash, you are ANALITICAL,
    although i could see some of the things you said I didn't realize the other ones
    that were bothering me until you mentioned them. This is why stalking this forum
    is so good, you always learn something.\r\n\r\nCaco, about the invite, I like
    the colours, and i have to agree with most all of what Prakash said. Maybe you
    could lose the flower detail altogether or leave them with very little colour,
    as if they were a watermark...  The double As on the right upper corner could
    go as well.  I think that you need to de-clutter the invite a bit, to me is asking
    for more negative (white) space all around.  If you look at the invite in terms
    of space is not equilibrated, too much weight on the bottom...  \r\nHope this
    helps, \r\nand sorry for my crappy english :)"

  body: "Ok Typophiles, I completely agree with your critique and thanks Prakash for
    being so honest, I like that. I think I \u2018m frightened when beginning to design
    for myself and don\u2019t even see what\u2019s wrong on it, plus I was pushing
    the flower thing too far.\r\nSo on my next attempt I realize it was too hard to
    match my own calligraphy with another typeface. On the type exploration I picked
    from top to bottom \u201CFF Clifford\u201D (same as previous comp, \u201COrigami
    MT\u201D and \u201CVendeta\u201D. The last two have a bit more humanistic side
    but still don\u2019t think quite did it for me. I really don\u2019t want this
    to look too classic so I went back to the typefaces I had before; Mrs Eaves, Filosofia,
    Sloop and Brickham.\r\nI gave it a lot more negative space and since I have to
    use both of our parents full names (yes two last names) and even the priest name,
    I decided to go horizontal. All this names and addresses made this  so text heavy
    as opposed to some invites I\u2019ve seen in the States but I think the horizontal
    helped.\r\nAnother thing is a loosed the bold flower and just kept the more simple
    one, it seems to distract less but still maintains the little meaning I found
    on it.\r\nHope you guys are having as much fun as I am, and I will surely post
    pictures of the final printed piece for all of those who helped.\r\nLet\u2019s
    keep this critique going!\r\n\r\nThanks all\r\n"

  body: "The more formal script of version C seems to work better with the informal
    illustrations, the justified copy needs some work on it the first line is very
    loose, you could bring the date back up by reducing the point size or increase
    the measure, leaving the month on line 2*, this might bring the whole church name
    back on to line 2, This will leave line 3 really loose so you could make that
    left aligned and leave line 4 a separate line. There is no fullstop on line 4
    and there is colon before the names which doesn't seem required. I might look
    at raising the y in the names a touch. Finally I would check the lightness of
    the blue in print, chocolate and blue make a good pallette though. I hope I have
    read the Spanish correctly.\r\nTim\r\n* alternatively you could look at pulling
    the whole date to the left of the lefthand margin."

  body: "Hi again Typophiles!\r\nThanks Tim for the very detailed critique, I\u2019m
    working on those details now.\r\nWell to all I guess I\u2019m a little uncomfortable
    using Mrs. Eaves, I really like it but I\u2019ve always thought this has been
    over used and so I tried to avoid it every time I could although for this one
    it seems to fit, It\u2019s classic but there\u2019s a twist to the characters
    with unusual shapes. It seems to make good contrast with the illustrations as
    well as making it look modern as opposed to the ancient humanist part in the Aztec
    side which was really not were I wanted to take this. Just to reiterate I based
    the idea on the meaning of the day and the interesting meanings I found in that
    mythology.\r\nSo if anybody has another typeface recommendation I will take a
    deep look into it. Also notice the two ligatures I was able to sneak in this piece.
    That made me happy =).\r\n\r\nThanks again and I\u2019ll keep working.\r\n"

  body: "Resist the urge to add a lot of extra leading to your blocks of copy. Although
    this may seem \"designy\" it actually erodes legibility by introducing, what I
    call, \"rivers\" of white space between the lines of copy. This visually breaks
    your blocks of copy into stripes, a highly graphic approach that seems out of
    place in an invitation. Remember this is an invitation, and I assume you would
    want the type to be inviting. The effect becomes worse when you set body copy
    in ALL CAPS because due to its visual regularity. \r\n\r\nI might try tightening
    up the leading a bit overall and remove the All Caps from your body copy. \r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    I like your color choices. Should be very nice letterpressed.\r\n\r\nMB"
