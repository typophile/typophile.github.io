body: "The 18th issue of the TYPO magazine is dedicated to British typographer Matthew
  Carter, who recently celebrated the fiftieth anniversary since the beginning of
  his career. The essay outlining Carter's lifelong work was composed by Margaret
  Re, American researcher of typography and a curator of the exhibition Typographically
  Speaking: The Art of Matthew Carter. It also includes an overview of all Carter's
  typefaces composed since 1963. \r\nOn further twenty pages of the magazine, Carter
  was interviewed by our Polish contributor Adam Twardoch, recapitulating his career,
  sharing his intimate views on the work of a typographer, and even revealing personal
  details from the life of this typographic star.  \r\n \r\nThe TYPO magazine is published
  bi-monthly in English and Czech since January 2003. It contains 32-44 full color
  pages printed on high quality coated paper of 250 \xD7 310 mm format. Information
  on subscriptions at www.magtypo.cz. Contact: Linda Kudrnovska, editorial office
  manager, linda(at)magtypo(dot)cz.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_obalka_18.jpg]"
