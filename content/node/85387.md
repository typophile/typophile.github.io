body: "Hello all! \r\n\r\nThis is my first time posting here, but it is also my first
  typeface so I find it fitting. \r\n\r\nAny critique would be great.\r\n\r\nMy intentions
  on this piece were to keep it modern and neutral \r\nbut designed and stylized by
  logic and reason.\r\n\r\nThere are many common negative and positive shapes throughout
  that keep it all together.\r\nBut I know it's not perfect yet and I'm still willing
  to alter it if need be.\r\n\r\nIt was a style choice to have a low x-height. I know
  for legibility purposes it's usually a little higher (not at 50% like it is here)
  , and at small sizes, it feels handwritten.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've had trouble with the
  / V/. I want it to be consistent but if anyone agrees, I might go back and look
  at it again? What do you say?\r\n\r\nI've also heard an illustrator friend say he
  wasn't feeling the /B/ ?\r\n\r\nThat being said...\r\nAny agreements, glaring mistakes
  or particular changes that you feel should be made?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nWIlling
  to hear from all!"

  body: "The \"B\" and \"R\" seem a bit strange, like there is a little too much weight
    in the middle, where everything comes together at the stem (I guess this is why
    the \"P\" doesn't bother me as much).  \r\n\r\nAlso the \"x\" looks a little like
    an \"n\" to me.\r\n\r\nJust my initial reactions."

  body: "Hallo Kyle,\r\n\r\nI like this project, your thought way and method it's
    running well but need refine little details like joinings between curve shapes
    and straight stems, also adjust little optical details on height open forms like
    \"I\" looks tallest than the rest (remind horizontal forms looks darkest than
    verticals).\r\n\r\nI'm interesting to know what's more important to choose letter
    strokes in type design sketches; the maths geometric logic decisions or optical
    and perceptual reasons.\r\n\r\nBest wishes for you and your project.\r\n\r\n=)\r\nPedro"
