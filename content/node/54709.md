  body: "Objection. I don't know what this is, but it sure isn't Antique Olive. Look
    at the counter/apex of the \"A\", or the contrast in the bottom of the bowl in
    the \"R\". \r\n(Or please prove me wrong.)"

  body: "I'm not positive that it's Antique Olive, but I think it might be, if you
    consider how it looks when you add stroke to it. In the following sample I started
    with Antique Olive Medium and added 5 pt of stroke thickness. Then I converted
    to outlines and in the first A I grabbed the points for the crossbar and the counter,
    and moved them downward. You'll notice a little dot on top of the other 2 A's.
    I think that dot is an artifact of adding the stroke thickness, because it is
    not showing in the modified A with the counter moved downward.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AntOliveFat_5907.gif]"

  body: "Of course I should have further adjusted the tracking to move the letters
    apart even more, but I wanted to show how close I could get with that font. Perhaps
    the results would have been better if I started from a heavier weight, but Medium
    was the heaviest I had.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Oh, wow. I don't have Antique Olive, so I can't test this myself; I still
    think proportions are somewhat off, but I didn't expect you could get so close
    with it.\r\nIn that respect, I'll gladly stand corrected.\r\nThe thought seems
    kind of odd though \u2013 that would be a lot of tweaking to arrive at a fairly
    \"standard\"-looking heavy sans (departing from Olive which isn't exactly your
    standard, commonplace sans)."

  body: I agree with altaira, I don't feel the proportions are correct although I
    can offer no better suggestions as to what font was used
