body: I&#39;m starting my freelance business in graphic designing and am having trouble
  finding fonts for my logo.  For now the logo will just be my name, J.A. Hull &#40;letters
  moved around to protect the innocent.&#41;  I was thinking that under the name,
  in a different font, I would place the word &#34;Advertising&#34; formated to stretch
  from the &#34;J&#34; to the &#34;l&#34;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure everyone can relate,
  I&#39;ve created many, many printed pieces for others making fearless decisions.  As
  soon as I have to make a decision for myself...Brick Wall! <BR> <BR>Any advice?

  body: Tim -- Your intuitions are correct. It&#39;s very difficult to do your own
    logo. Your idea to just use type may be the best solution. After all, you&#39;re
    not American Airlines. They need a logo but do you? Paul Cutler has an idea --
    let your subconscious do the work. Who knows? Just don&#39;t sweat it. <BR> <BR>PG

  body: Yeah, it&#39;s the designer/typographer equivalent of the self-portrait. <BR>
    <BR>I say pick a font that you unabashedly love, if you can&#39;t find one that
    seems &#39;you&#39;. <BR> <BR>This may make it more enjoyable and lead you in
    a direction you were unable to think of before. I feel for you. I&#39;ve hit some
    walls recently too, but now I&#39;m over them and the view is great.

  body: I&#39;ve personally found that its harder to design stuff for yourself, then
    design it for the client. <BR>maybe because, I&#39;m too fussy, or don&#39;t know
    what i want.
