  body: "Joe, for someone so picky about grammar, it's ironic that you would misuse
    \"malapropism\".\r\n\r\nWhat do you suppose \"Fontographer\" sounds like, but
    isn't?\r\nPhotographer? Pornographer? \r\n\r\nThis is more neologism than misuse.\r\nDeriving
    a generic noun or verb from a brand name may be considered as neologism, a form
    of proprietary eponym.\r\n\r\nFontographer, as a noun used to describe a person
    who makes fonts, is quite logical, because it avoids the ambiguity of using \"typographer\"
    for type designer\r\n\r\nIf there is no allusion (intended or otherwise) to the
    software product, \"fontographer\" follows the non-professional trend that assumes
    \"font\" to mean \"typeface\". If \"typographer\" exists, why not \"fontographer\"?\r\n\r\nNonetheless,
    I still prefer to call myself a type designer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
