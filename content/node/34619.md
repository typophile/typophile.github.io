  know who designed it or I would of just emailed him/her.  Take a look:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/summer_5826.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  idea what this was before the customizations?  It's so pretty.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm not even going to try guessing the font of this but considering the fact
    there are so many differences and customizations here and roughness on the curves
    (look at non smooth curve of the \"S\") it looks a lot like this has been drawn
    on paper and later scanned, vectorised and adjusted.\r\n\r\nAt least the bigger
    \"R\" reminds me very much of Caslon Swash. But heavily customized.\r\n\r\nThere's
    also resemblance with Slimbach's Minion Swash capitals..."
