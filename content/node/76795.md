body: "HELP!\r\n\r\nI am designing a brand that will rarely, if ever, be used in print.
  Screen legibility is crucial. It's hard to explain the context but think \"Audi
  meets The Economist\" or something like that.\r\n\r\nWeb-fonts in high volume destroy
  loading time to a degree that I can't tolerate, so keep in mind that I need a body
  font that is a system font and doesn't kill the branding. \r\n\r\nOriginally I had
  almost decided on Bodoni and Gotham in various weights (Helvetica as a body font)
  which was a nice pair, on paper. I have since arrived at Gotham Narrow with Times.\r\n\r\nBodoni
  Bold had caps, punctuation, and numbers that I loved, but as an on-screen font it
  made me lose sleep. Gotham Narrow/Times is amazingly legible, but seems a little
  dry as a brand pair. Or does it?\r\n\r\nPlease offer your opinions so I can make
  a choice! Was I better off with Bodoni/Gotham, am I fine now with Gotham/Times,
  or would a third font spice up my safe pairing?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Help indeed. You're the designer of the brand, you'll have to make all of
    those decisions. Do you want to solicit opinions so when your font mix goes horribly
    wrong you can blame it on someone else?

  body: "Unless your audience is typographers, I doubt they will feel one way or the
    other about whether the fonts you mention are dull, but will be more receptive
    to the way they are speced.\r\n\r\nSo using those well-tried fonts will be safe.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if you are trying to impress your peers or stave off your own ennui, you might
    consider something off the beaten path.\r\n\r\nI for one am most impressed by
    people who use fonts I am unfamiliar with in novel ways.\r\n\r\nThe challenge
    is to invest the effort in making them work on the job in hand, because there
    is no easy template, of what others have done, to follow.\r\n\r\nMany designers
    feel that fonts which have not been assimilated into the collective by wide usage
    have too much personality.\r\nYou will have to draw the balance for yourself,
    between the personality of the font and that of your layout. That's style."

title: Gotham + Times = legible on screen and... boring?
