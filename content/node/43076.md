  give me an advice if you know anything about Leopard and FFIL!\r\n\r\nI just got
  new iMac at my office and installed OS 10.5.1.\r\nTill yesterday, I was using FFIL
  formatted font suitcase on my lovely old PPC iMac, with OS 10.4.11.\r\nBut it seems
  that my new Leopard OS dosen't recognize FFIL file as a font but a \"Unix execute
  file\". Even Font Book and Linotype FontExplorer can't open the ex-FFIL files, which
  are about 50% of the fonts I have!\r\n\r\nI think this might be an problem of my
  computer, but since I'm the only one who works on Leopard in my office, so I decide
  to ask people here for an advice.\r\nDoes anyone know what's going on with my new
  working equipment?\r\nPlease please help me!"

  body: You should upgrade to 10.5.2 first. That fixed many problems in 10.5 and not
    all of them were documented. My fonts work (mostly!) in 10.5.2.

    can be a problem of font file itself, \r\nso I'll try to copy my fonts from old
    computers again.\r\n\r\nThank you again to kind people!"

  body: How did you get the font file from the old iMac to your newer Mac? Over the
    network? Using a flash drive? A floppy disk ( ;-)?

  body: "What Mark is alluding to, is a situation where the old hidden \"resource
    fork\" data has been stripped away from your font file by storing the file on
    a file system that doesn't support it. On your old system, make a .zip or .sit
    archive of the fonts and then move them over. At this point in history, font suitcases
    are just about the only type of file in common use that keeps critical data in
    the resource fork. In the old days most common document formats used resource
    fork data to identify the filetype, but you could still often get it to work by
    adding a file extension. Not so with font suitcases. \r\n\r\nNote: You can verify
    this by getting info on the file. If it's 0K in size, this is what is happening.
    \r\n\r\nThis can be very confusing for people who recently switched to Mac because
    no analogous situation exists with other operating systems. Basically, Apple is
    providing backward compatibility with a 20yr old file format. "

    The message really misleads as to what has happened."
