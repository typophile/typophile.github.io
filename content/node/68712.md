body: "EAU CLAIRE, WI \u2013 March 24, 2010 Font Diner, Inc. (www.fontdiner.com),
  a leading retro typography design firm, has announced the revival of the historic
  Lettering, Inc. font library created in the 1930s through the mid-1970's.\r\n\r\nFounded
  in 1939 by Edwin W. Krauter of Chicago, Lettering, Inc. produced its own patented
  Photo-Ray process of lettering (US Pat 2165861) in which transparent letters made
  from original alphabets were assembled by hand and then placed in a line (angled
  or curved if so desired) and then photographed. This \"glass setting\" process created
  flawlessly set headlines and, with multiple character forms to choose from, the
  headline looked authentically lettered.\r\n\r\nAn early competitor of Photo Lettering,
  Inc, they employed such notable lettering artists of the time as Oscar Ogg, Ray
  DaBoll and Ray Baker, among others. At its height in the late 1960s, Lettering,
  Inc. had as many as 14 franchises operating in the US and Canada and was continually
  producing new alphabet designs. As the market changed and computer technology evolved,
  Lettering, Inc. became less of a supplier of type to the ad agencies and became
  more involved as a supplier of high-end graphics and type to the big Detroit auto
  makers. Today, from its Southfield, Michigan office, Lettering, Inc. continues to
  provide various graphics services to a diverse group of customers.\r\n\r\nEach Lettering,
  Inc. alphabet was originally designed with nearly 3-4 alternate glyph forms for
  every character and ligature pair, many with well over 300 latin characters alone.
  Stuart Sandler, President of Font Diner, Inc. intends to release the Lettering,
  Inc. library in OpenType format so the original designs can be fully realized with
  a dynamic feature set including every alternate glyph forms and automatic substitutive
  ligature as it was designed by the original artists. \"We're also thrilled to be
  working from the original ink drawings on board by the original Lettering, Inc.
  artists that have been in the Lettering, Inc. archives since the 1930s.\" says Sandler.\r\n\r\n\"We
  are very happy to work with Font Diner to once again make these beautiful and unique
  typefaces available to the public.\" says Karin Krauter of Lettering, Inc. \"So
  much of this wonderful collection has never been seen before and we're pleased to
  honor and revive the work of these highly-skilled and talented lettering artists
  from the heyday of lettering to be appreciated and enjoyed by modern designers again.\"
  explains Sandler.\r\n\r\nAn illustrated history of Lettering, Inc. is currently
  being researched and written by Sandler with the assistance of many current and
  former Lettering, Inc. employees. His work will accurately re-tell the evolution
  of Lettering, Inc., its founder Ed Krauter and the significant contributions of
  Lettering, Inc. to the typographic industry. A re-release of the original Lettering,
  Inc. catalogs is also planned.\r\n\r\nFont Diner, Inc.\r\n\r\nStuart Sandler launched
  the Font Diner (www.fontdiner.com) foundry in 1996 and has become a major resource
  for retro design software products. He has created more than 400 original typefaces
  for the graphic design industry and established a reputation as the premier retro
  display typography designer inspired by 1950s popular culture. Sandler added a second
  division to the Font Diner umbrella in 2004 (www.misterretro.com) that features
  Machine Wash Image Filters\u2122 and Snappy Hour\u2122 vector images. In 2006, he
  expanded his corporation again thru a joint venture as publisher of high quality
  display typefaces at Font Bros (www.fontbros.com) before beginning his work in the
  revival of photolettered cold-type with his acquisition of the Filmotype Library
  in 2006 with over a dozen digital revivals to date."

    already busy which is why I have a Junto set up to assist me in the digitizing
    of these libraries. . . This is not a closed process by any means and those who
    saw me speak at Typecon in Atlanta last year can attest to my call for participation
    . . . Any professional typeface designer with at least 40 quality typefaces to
    their credit is eligible to participate in the re-digitization of the Filmotype
    and now Lettering, Inc. libraries . . . I can be contacted off-list at diner (at)
    fontdiner (dot) com\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart"
