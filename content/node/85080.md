  \"Hustle Project\" was written in Clan Pro or Clan Pro Narrow -- it's close, but
  not exact. Could it be Drescher Grotesk BT Bold?\r\n\r\nI also can't figure out
  the font the word \"The\" is written in either. EF Brush Script is close, but the
  \"T\" and lower-case \"e\" aren't the same.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://hustleproject.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/logo.jpg"
