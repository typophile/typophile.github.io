  or wrongly chosen for the application at hand but this nomination is not about that,
  nor is it about legibility or history. Assuming a typeface meets the criteria it's
  designer set out to achieve, both technically and aesthetically, nominate typefaces
  you'd never want to be associated with. \r\n\r\nIn other words, nominate the typefaces
  you hate most!\r\n\r\n[[http://ekek.planet.ee/nomi/nation.php|YOU CAN NOMINATE HERE]]\r\n\r\n"
