body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI would like to purchase a starter set of fonts that I could use
  on some websites that I develop and host. Ideally I'd like a starter kit that has
  a nice range of fonts for use in headings and body, so that I can give different
  websites different look and feel.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions of starter kits I might
  look at? It needs to be something that has a suitable license for use on websites?
  \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJason"
