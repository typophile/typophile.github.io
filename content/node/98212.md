    quotation marks on the baseline for another language I can't recall at the moment.
    I believe there is another written language that uses underscores.

  body: "Just to be clear: I'm not talking about the use of guillemets in French -
    I'm well aware that's what's used instead of floating \"66/99\" quotes (in fact
    we use guillemets in Armenian too). What I'm talking about is using a closing
    guillemet where an opening one seems normal.\r\n\r\nBut the wiki above does actually
    contain a pertinent passage:\r\n\"\r\nIn many printed books, when quotations are
    spanning multiple lines of text (including multiple paragraphs), an additional
    closing quotation sign is traditionally used at the <em>beginning</em> of each
    line continuing a quotation ; any right-pointing guillemet at the beginning of
    a line does <strong>not</strong> close the current quotation; this convention
    has been consistently used since the beginning of the 19th century by most book
    printers (and is still in use today). Note that such insertion of continuation
    quotation marks will also occur if there's a word hyphenation break. Unfortunately,
    there is still no support for automatic insertion of these continuation guillemets
    in HTML/CSS and in many word-processors, so these have to be inserted by manual
    typesetting:\r\n\r\n    \xAB C\u2019est une belle journ\xE9e pour les Montr\xE9alais,
    soutient\r\n    \xBB le ministre. Ces investissements stimuleront la crois-\r\n
    \   \xBB sance \xE9conomique. \xBB\r\n\"\r\n\r\nIn that example on Flickr, I can't
    see the left edge of the text but it's possible the closing-for-opening guillemets
    are only placed at the beginnings of on-going paragraphs, which would not be exactly
    what the example in the wiki shows.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>a symbol combining ....</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSounds
    fascinating, but you've lost me completely. Explain?\r\n\r\nConcerning dashes
    at linebreaks:\r\n- I remember a while back a French typophile (I even met him
    at the Rome ATypI, but I can't remember his name at the moment) suggesting the
    use of the Logical Not sign to hyphenate long URLs that would need to go over
    a linebreak. I liked the idea but not many others did.\r\n- In Armenian we have
    different symbols for a compound-word dash versus a linebreak dash, but sadly
    the latter has been folded into the former in practice (although it <em>is</em>
    in Unicode).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    is also what the first reply spoke of, but it seems like you are referring to
    something entirely different of which I was not aware, that the convention for
    continuing a quote between paragraphs in French is different;\r\n\r\n(quote)\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n(quote
    p1\r\n(quote p2)\r\n\r\nin English, but\r\n\r\n(quote p1\r\n)quote p2)\r\n\r\nin
    French - which does have the virtue of greater unambiguity, since the closing
    quote occurring at the beginning of a paragraph can only mean one thing."

  body: "I thought German as well.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, while I will restrain myself
    with difficulty from a <em>political</em> comment, it may be noted that a symbol
    combining the ideas of the microcosm and the macrocosm on the one hand, and the
    tourbillon on the other, was used by Western occultists - such as Oswald Wirth
    - even before the Raelians got a hold of it.\r\n\r\n(Has Ryan Maelhorn's account
    been \"hacked\" now, by someone else objecting to that icon, including possibly
    an admin?)\r\n\r\nI believe it's Italian that uses underscores instead of hyphens
    at line breaks."

  body: "I have definitely seen it used on every line before, but I believe it was
    used even within the same paragraph, e.g.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Someone cried out
    \xABwhat is it\r\n\xBBthat is going on over there in\r\n\xBBthe forest?\xBB </blockquote>\r\n\r\nHere's
    a [[http://www.uamenlinea.uam.mx/materiales/lengua/puntuacion/html/comi.htm|reference]]
    from UAMexico's site.  Can't think what work I had read a few months ago that
    used it as such.\r\n\r\nIn modern Spanish, the standard is as noted by hrant for
    French (DPD comillas 2):\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Al citar algo muy largo, \xABse \r\nusan
    las comillas de apertura\r\npara iniciarlo.\r\n\xBB Y en el siguiente p\xE1rrafo,
    se\r\nsigue con una comilla de cierre,\r\ncon otra de cierra parar acabar\r\nla
    cita\xBB</blockquote>\r\n\r\nEdit: found an official source to the every line
    rule.  The 1884 DRAE has as its entry for comilla:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Signo ortogr\xE1fico
    ( \xAB\_\xBB\_) que se pone al principio y fin de las frases inclu\xEDdas como
    citas \xF3 ejemplos en impresos \xF3 manuscritos, y tambi\xE9n, \xE1 veces, <em>al
    principio de todos los renglones que estas frases ocupan</em>.\u2026</blockquote>\r\nThat
    is,\r\n<blockquote>Orthographic symbol ( \xAB\_\xBB\_) placed at the beginning
    and end of phrases included as quotations or examples in print or manuscript,
    and also, sometimes,  <em>at the beginning of all the lines that these phrases
    occupy</em>.\u2026</blockquote>"
