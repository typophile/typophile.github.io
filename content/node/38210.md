  poster-looking swash logotype:\r\nwww.giantartists.com[img:sites/default/files/old-images/main_giantartists_4528.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n2)
  A cursive font. I found a similar one called Expletive at www.virusfonts.com ,but
  it's not quite as plump.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cursive_5490.png]\r\n\r\n3)
  \"Happily Ever After\" This is from a promotion on Nickelodeon. One is another cursive-y
  typeface, the other is a more retro-looking swash.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/happily_6202....png]\r\n\r\n"

  body: Happily looks similar to [[http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=ALSO-ORIO|Orion]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/adonis-old-style-sg/|Adonis
    Old Style]], but it's not quite the same. [[http://ms-studio.com/FontSales/coquette.html#|Coquette]]
