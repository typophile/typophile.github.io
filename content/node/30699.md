  body: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/6411">This old thread</a> suggests that
    these are hard specimens to track down. Try getting in touch with Dan Reynolds
    and find out if that book was any good, if so you can just order a copy from <a
    href="http://www.amazon.fr/Romain-typographie-service-lEtat-1702-2002/dp/2856820174">Amazon
    France</a>.

    as was possible without being able to read it ;-)\r\n\r\nBut I'm a sucker for
    type books. I shell out money for almost anything if I think that I could possibly
    learn from it, now or in the future."

    is great. A bit overwhelming, but in a very good way."
