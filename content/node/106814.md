  all,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to find out what font this is. It look like Monogram KK but
  it isn't.\r\n\r\nIt might be a special engraver's font, but I thought I'd ask you
  guys.\r\n\r\nI hope that you can solve this and I thank you in advance\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n"

    looks very much like that so it may match.

    the name of \"Upright Script.\" See for example:\r\nhttp://www.stickyj.com/engraving-font-samples.html\r\nHere
    is a character set, including lowercase:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UprightScriptEngraversFont_3982.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Don, thanks for your input\r\n\r\nIt's that A that I have never seen before.\r\nBut
    anyway I notice now that the A has been hand (or pantograph) engraved, and that
    he has modified the \"leg\" endings compared to the letter set, for example.\r\nI
    could re-design them but I'm not sure that the engraving machines would be able
    to read the design. I'll have to try it out."
