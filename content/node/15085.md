    than to find this. :~(

  body: "Kyle,\r\nare you looking for written style manuals (guidelines) used by publications
    or more specifically format guidlines for magazine production? Many style guides
    focus on standards of writing instead of production. Here are a few:\r\n\r\n<a

    journalist style guide</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bcbsnc.com/inside/style-guide/\"
    target=\"new\">Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina Corporate Style Guide</a>\r\n\r\nLinks
    to <a href=\"http://tc.eserver.org/dir/Style-Guides&skip=0\" target=\"new\">various
    sites using style guides</a> or information on starting a style guide.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style guides!"

  body: I was actually looking for graphic style guides. The writing guides seem to
    be easy to come by (simply googling), but standards dictating typography, baseline
    grids, and graphical treatments are what I am truely in search of.

  body: I would imagine that most magazines would not make these guides public (somebody
    was paid a lot of $ to develop them). I don't know if you're designing a magazine,
    if so, go down to your local bookstore and purchase an armful of magazines and
    study the layouts, grids, etc. I am not suggesting plagarism, or copying, but
    studying and learning. There are also a number of good books out there on grids,
    and grid systems, but none that I know of that deal exclusively with magazines.

  body: "I spent a lot of time in magazines before I did this type design thing.\r\n\r\nMost
    magazine layout is based on the use of the odd numbered column grid. 5, 7, 9,
    or the 13 column grid that Willi Kunz made famous. This allows lots of different
    text column widths for features and departments, while also allowing white space
    to be managed in a organized way."
