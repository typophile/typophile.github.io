  the same name. It was in a gaudy gold on blood red presentation, which I eliminated.
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/GermanVictimsScriptSM_5345.jpg]\r\nThe design
  looks similar to some German script fonts from the 1920s and 1930s that are fairly
  regular in style and were set in metal type. But I did not find a match in Jaspert's
  _Type Encyclopaedia_.\r\nRepeating letters _m_ and _i_ seem to be identical. The
  good fit of the tails with following letters might be produced by the usual methods
  used to create a digital font\r\nI would welcome any suggestions.\r\nThanks .\r\nDon"

    I note that the designers, Veronika Elsner, and G\xFCnther Flake, are German.
    Just got the date wrong by a few decades :)\r\nDon"

    Holmes</a>. Elsner & Flake are only mentioned as the \u2018designer owners\u2019
    (which probably means that they are allowed to make money from this design or
    something like that)."
