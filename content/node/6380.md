body: I am working on a logo for a client, and they want a look of a branded piece
  of wood - meaning that there company name would be burned &#40;branded&#41; into
  the wood, like on a wood barrel. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions of good fonts for this?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance!

    I would for western wear.

  body: Jesse, <BR> <BR>Great question, I should have clarified. It is a restaurant,
    that focuses on grilled food. I am branding them in a &#34;big shoulders of Chicago&#34;
    feel. Think of Chicago in the 40&#39;s, but not going for the nostalgic &#34;saloon&#34;
    feel.

  body: What if you ... and this is more or less a crazy idea ... but what if you
    typeset it in something from that era, and then laid that onto some wood and then
    with a hand held wood burner &#40;the kind you can get at a craft store&#41; you
    burned the letters into the wood and then photographed that? Or get a brand made
    with your typefaces. There must be something available like that. If you use a
    bold enough sans and a hard/white enough wood it would be easy to photograph.

  body: i&#39;m sure you can pretty much choose any face you like, make a nice clean
    design and then rough it up in photoshop or maybe even illustrator. i don&#39;t
    know of any particular fonts that look like something that&#39;s been branded
    but there are tons of grunge fonts that might have that kind of look.

  body: You might try looking at Sodom, Gomorrah, and/or Goshen from Chank/BLINCtype.
    They look branded just sitting on the page. Aquacia from Joe Coniglio also looks
    like something you&#39;d see burned into the side of a barrell.
