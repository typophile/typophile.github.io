  an extended period of time. Be very cautious. Boilers that sit idle will corrode
  leaving you with a quite a mess when you want to place the boiler back in service.
  \r\n\r\nHere are two ways you can store your boiler.\r\n\r\nThe first is wet storage,
  which is generally better for shorter periods of time. In fact, we would recommend
  wet storage for anybody that needs a boiler for emergency stand-by. A word of caution,
  make sure the temperatures in your boiler room do not dip below freezing.\r\n\r\nFor
  wet storage we recommend the following steps:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tInspect the boiler
  and clean it if needed\r\n\u2022\tFill the boiler with deaerated feedwater to the
  normal levels\r\n\u2022\tContact your water treatment company for the chemicals
  needed to condition the water\r\n\u2022\tAn alternative would be using a nitrogen
  blanket throughout the entire boiler. Make sure the vents are closed and that the
  nitrogen pressure is greater than atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nThe dry storage method
  is preferred for boilers that will be out of service for an extended period of time
  or where the temperatures can go below freezing.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tAgain, inspect and
  clean your boiler\r\n\u2022\tDrain all the water and make sure that the boiler is
  completely dried. Remember, any moisture left on boiler surfaces will eventually
  corrode\r\n\u2022\tNext make sure that moisture cannot enter the boiler. Close off
  any steam lines, feed lines and any points of entry for air\r\n\u2022\tThen place
  moisture absorbent material, such as quicklime or silica gel inside the boiler.
  This should be placed on trays inside the boiler. We suggest 2 pounds of quicklime
  or 5 pounds of silica gel per 30 cubic feet of boiler volume.\r\n\u2022\tClose up
  all manways and handholes \r\n\u2022\tNext place a sign on the boiler so that nobody
  makes the mistake of firing it without removing the absorbent material. This sign
  might read as follows:\r\n\u2022\tAttention - moisture absorbent material has been
  placed in the water side and furnace of this boiler. This material must be removed
  before water is placed in the boiler and before the boiler is fired.\r\n\u2022\tFinally,
  inspect the boiler every two or three months and replace the absorbent materials
  with new or regenerated materials.\r\n\r\nSince 1946, P. C. McKenzie Company has
  been actively involved in the Natural Gas Industry, this experience combined with
  Ingersoll Rand, the leader in natural gas compression for the NGV market, makes
  us the ideal solution for your NGV station design.\r\n\r\nToday, P.C. McKenzie Company
  is a leading supplier of compressed natural gas (CNG) equipment for vehicle fueling.
  \r\n\r\nThe rugged, prepackaged modular compressor systems are available in sizes
  ranging from 28 scfm up to 116 scfm.\r\n"
