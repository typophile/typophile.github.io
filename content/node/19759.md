body: "When pressing the Apply and save button in Kerning assistance, FL generates
  an opentype kern feature.\r\nHowever, when generating the opentype font, FL seems
  to dislike the feature script it just made..\r\nIt says: \"glyph class not defined
  (text was \"@_kern\"). \"\r\nAll my classes are named the same way (_kern-xxx).\r\nWhat
  could be wrong?"

    while compiling OpenType font.\"\r\nCould it be there are double kern values for
    some pairs?"

  body: "Great!!\r\n\r\nBTW, you're using FontLab 4.6, aren't you? I can tell by the
    way the <em>kern</em> feature is built. FontLab 5 does a much better job. Upgrade
    if you have the chance."
