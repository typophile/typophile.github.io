  alt=""> <BR> <BR>Proposed Styles 2 - Officer &amp; Enlisted <BR> <BR>I am not sure
  that weights are relevant here because this <BR>font is based on the depth markings
  made with tiles on the side  <BR>of the pool I use here at at the local Army base.  <BR>
  <BR>The Officer Style &amp; proposed Enlisted style is not based on strict  <BR>observation
  per se.  There is no officer or enlisted pool here in AK.  Instead the &#39;Officer&#39;
  is what I imagined you might do with tile if you had the time/money/inclination.  The
  &#39;Enlisted&#39; will use fewer fancy cuts and will be more blocky &amp; maybe
  shorter.   <BR> <BR>I have also been thinking of adding the missing tiles for an
  overlay 2 tile color look &amp; maybe doing a reverse version so the completed set
  would be 4 or 6 fonts total. <BR> <BR>I have hinted &amp; kerned this font too.

  body: It could. The pool I swim in uses a form like I have &#40; the angled line
    not the straight&#41; but the height of the characters is 2 tiles less. Maybe
    I&#39;ll make a font of altrenate characters too. In the meantime I think I&#39;d
    like to stay true to the basic shape of the number but improve it in some way.
    Maybe it needs to be wider to allow a bigger counter -  I&#39;ll post what i work
    out in the next few days.

  body: 'Hi, Eben. <BR> <BR>Maybe I am missing something, but I am wondering: what
    is the idea behind your font? It seems as if some of your characters are part
    of a modular idea, in which you use a minimum of modules &#40;i.e., a square and
    a triangle derived from that square&#41; to create a set of characters, all of
    this with an underlying grid to enforce some consistency. Examples of this are
    your lower case <b>o</b> and <b>n</b>. But with other characters it seems as if
    you are adapting your modules to the shape of the letter, instead of the other
    way around. Your upper case <b>V</b> is an example of this: lots of differently-shaped
    triangle modules. <BR> <BR>I know you hint at a stricter enforcement of a modular
    structure in your proposed '

  body: 'I do have an awareness that it seems like some letters are really worked
    &amp; others not. I do feel that tension. I should explain that what I found when
    I was observing the letters at the pool was that when they made the letters from
    tiles they looked for a solution that didn&#39;t require extra cuts. Just whole
    tiles. Like the T . When no solution was apparent with whole tiles they made anged
    cuts in the tiles. The V is a copy of what they did with the tiles at the pool.
    So I could say it&#39;s the tension of tiles. <BR> <BR>There isn&#39;t a whole
    alphabet to refer to, incomplete numbers &amp; no lowercase at all so I am extrapolating...  <BR>
    <BR>Both the officer &amp; enlisted are speculation but based on observation.
    I actually built the font around squares &amp; trangles initially &amp; then when
    I was swimming I noticed the half cuts used on the 3 &amp; the angled cuts used
    on the &#39;V&#39;. So I thought: With these new rules avaialble - what can I
    improve using the new diagonal? The half tile? <BR> <BR>At some point I may have
    to change the font because being true to my concept may not give me the results
    I am looking for. <BR> <BR> I want the font to be resonable for a longish title
    &amp; not just 1,2 or 3 words at at time. Actually the lowercase n has a special
    cut I invented to make it read better. It isn&#39;t a trangle. The lower case
    a too. <BR> <BR>I changed a few characters too.  <BR> <BR>Have a look, there is
    a new 4, G, &amp; @. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68168.gif"

    is thoretically fine &amp; looks fine in many ways but it isn&#39;t what they
    have at the pool. The new one is closer to what is there than my old one. <BR>
    <BR>It may be that when the other background tiles can be seen it will make more
    sense too. I&#39;m working on that 2nd font, the other tiles, now.'

    <BR>This set of examples wwas inspired in part by Ricardo Cordoba&#39;s comments.  <BR>
    <BR>The red charcters are the new ones. Better worse? Not done?  <BR> <BR>I would
    like for it to be possible to set a paragraph in the font if you were so inclined
    so I checked the spacing between &amp; found it too loose. Here is the correction.
    <BR> <BR>I might open the spaces between tiles a little too. What do you think?

  body: Ricardo, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the feedback! <BR> <BR>I will think about the
    M. It is sort of the odd one out now.  <BR> <BR>There is a new V. It has a spike
    at the bottom. The new V is how they have it at the pool. I still like the 2 old
    ones but they are not as good &amp; the 1st one doesn&#39;t fit in this font.  <BR>
    <BR>For a while guess I thought I would try some trajan/myriad style in some of
    the caps to try to make the Officer style more roman &amp; less boringly military
    - if that makes sense. If I had gone whole hog I would have needed a more circular
    O. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>But I don&#39;t think it worked &amp; I don&#39;t think you
    did either so...  <BR> <BR>About modularity. I have been trying to avoid an overly
    modular look in the font. Alot of my interest in bitmapped &amp; other particle
    based fonts has to do with the eccentric ways that characters are made when they
    are forced into limited circumstances. I think the &#42;really&#42; modular looking
    stuff just seems lazy/boring looking. It&#39;s when you try to make something
    that is more readable &amp; break the regularity a bit that things get interesting.
    I was looking a really quirky 7 today on a parking ticket. It isn&#39;t that I
    think this stuff is really &#42;fine&#42; type either. I just like it. The vibe
    is interesting to me. Don&#39;t know why. <BR> <BR>In the meantime I have been
    rounding the edges of the squares - like the tiles. Now I have to decide whether
    to leave all the parts rounded or to make the cuts as sharp as they are at the
    pool. Probably the later.  <BR> <BR>And there are 2-3 other things &amp; then
    I think I will release this. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post what I have in another day
    or two. <BR> <BR>Regarding the A &amp; the V - I don&#39;t think it is a good
    idea for them to mirror each other in this case. The counter of the A gets too
    small. Especially now that the V has the spike. <BR> <BR>Now that I look at it
    I think I have a new idea for the Z to bring it into line. This soulution is inelegant
    but I hadn&#39;t seen another way. <BR> <BR>The N is asymetical but I actually
    hate the one at the pool. Too bone headed even for this font. I think this one
    is okay. <BR> <BR>Maybe I&#39;ll make a font of altrenates too. A set where the
    angled glyphs are boxy instead - I think the enlisted will be more like a bitmap
    &amp; no cuts. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll post stuff Monday I think.

    is showing great promise as applied in that &#34;Let&#39;s get cool in the pool&#34;
    image. Something about a cool, watery atmosphere really seems to click with it
    &#40;even though most pool lettering is nothing like that&#41;. <BR> <BR>I wish
    I had the time to get into a micro, glyph-level <BR>analysis, but let me just
    make these two macro observations: <BR>1&#41; Let go of the actual pool lettering
    you first saw. It served as great inspiration, but clinging to it too literally
    &#40;like some flotation device :-&#41; will limit the functionality of your end
    result &#40;it will impede learning to swim:-&#41;. So can obsessing over structural
    rules: make the letters what they need to be, not what the Rules want - we don&#39;t
    read rules, we read letters. <BR>2&#41; The most important element of this design
    is the gaps. And as with any delicate feature, they can get lost, aliased, blurry,
    etc. at smaller sizes. So I would recommend &#40;at least&#41; two cuts of the
    font, with different size gaps. You might even make a multiple-master axis for
    the gap size. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    The new design is more open &amp; will probably blur more on screen. Maybe thats

    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Ricardo, thanks for checking out Bahn. I hope to sort out the
    last issues with that one this summer &amp; get it out in the world. I hope to
    apply some of my own advice about quirkyness &#40;&amp; others&#41; to that font
    before it goes out too. I think that for this font &#40;&amp; Bahn&#41; the best
    way to create value in the font may be to create one or more fonts of variations
    in shapes since many letters/characters can be done differently.'
