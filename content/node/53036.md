  a new website via their <em>Show and Tell</em> blog (http://www.houseind.com/showandtell/):\r\n\r\n<cite>In
  the spirit of our initial contempt of the world wide waste of time as a delivery
  medium, we have tried to keep our reliance on third-party plug-ins and other digital
  trickery to a minimum for this new design. The site is more searchable, easier to
  use and actually generates simple readable urls.</cite>\r\n\r\nI agree. Check it
  out at http://www.houseind.com/\r\n\r\nKen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Folks,\r\n\r\nThanks for noticing and posting up about the new site design.
    Also thank you for the kind words. I would like to make a clarification and a
    comment.\r\n\r\nSuperUltraFabulous, we did not have any price increases. We did,
    however make the following changes to our multiple device licensing structure:\r\n\r\n1.
    Increased number of devices covered under the base licensing fee to ten from six.\r\n\r\n2.
    Got rid of the \"Locations\" restriction on the license. So, the \"devices\" just
    need to be owned by the same company or \"entity\". We wanted to make it easier
    for smaller companies and individual designers to properly license our font while
    making the fees more proportional for bigger companies and organizations.\r\n\r\nTo
    your other point, we agree that we need to show complete character sets. We are
    working on that now. In the mean time, we are using a newer version of Lettersetter
    that can preview any glyph in the character set. Thanks to Erik van Blokland and
    Tal Leming, Lettersetter can also read and preview any OpenType feature in the
    our fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your comments and happy new year!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRich
    Roat\r\n"
