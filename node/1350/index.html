<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>For those interested, the Arts and Entertainment section of today's New York Times has a feature on the redesign of Franklin Gothic for MoMA by Matthew Carter. The print edition features an overlayed image of the two typefaces and a picture of Carter in his studio. <br> <br><a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/21/arts/design/21BLUM.html target=_blank>http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/21/arts/design/21BLUM.html</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>It appears to me that the NYT is taking a quote about the typeface Franklin Gothic No. 2 out of context and applying it to the MoMA logotype, making a highly lauded and respected designer look like an &#149;&#149;&#149;. On top of that, they then make Carter's job look pointless. <br> <br>The author, Andrew Blum, decided to be glib and ignorantly dismissive. And the article reflects that.</div>

<div class=commentbody>There are in fact multiple faults with the reproductions shown: the small web image exhibits a sharpness difference which obviously cannot be due to the outlines; in Randal's top image the rendering of the new font is mangled (with half-bitting typical of conversion to low-res 1-bit rendering); and in the lower overlay you can't see what's going on in the corners. <br> <br>Not to mention that the string "MoMA" provides a severly handicapped representation of the fonts. <br> <br>> Doesn't it look like Carter's cut is the softer of the two? <br> <br>You can't tell, since it's a bad repro.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The problem with the question as posed by the NY <br>Times caption, and with the subsequent perseverating <br>over the two logos, is that Carter wasn't hired to <br>redraw the MoMA *logotype* -- he was hired to create <br>a revised cut of Franklin Gothic (two of them, in fact, <br>text and display). <br> <br>Any comparison of four letters -- well three, actually -- <br>especially these particular few, will inevitably show <br>little perceptible difference. The real differences, I <br>suspect (and justification for the project) will only be <br>seen when the fonts are used in mass. Then the <br>cumulative effect of refined letterforms and spacing may <br>show up in a difference in overall fit and color -- <br>moderate passages of text in a catalog or brochure, <br>large display signage, etc. <br> <br>A logo alone is bound to be an inadequate demonstration, <br>IMHO. <br> <br>-- K.</div>

<div class=commentbody>As a critique of the logo from the new design of Franklin Gothic. The mark of a good logo is surely that it reproduces well. <br>Is it supposed to appear in a box? <br>If so it demonstrates the difficulty of visually centering type in a box. <br>The Mo and oM spaces appear unequal.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant. In an attempt to answer your second question -- And I'll probably sound as if I'm waffling -- I think that perhaps they chose Franklin Gothic as an understated (yet bold) way of representing a museum which has some of the boldest and most colorful art in New York. Or maybe just plain old -- it holds color. Why dress up the museum too much? This said, I also like what The Walker in Minn. did with Matthew's type. So that is where I'm waffling. But, MoMA need not be that way. Why compare them to anyone?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I thought it strange that the writer didn't note that a <i>very</i> slightly modified Franklin Gothic No. 2 shows up all over the Times, in major section heads, captions, etc. Does anyone know how the Times arrived at their version of No. 2? It's very slightly condensed, and the dots of the i and j are a little taller, closing up the space between themselves and the lower parts of their letters, and the top of the lower-case t extends nearly to the cap height. Other than that it looks identical. <br> <br>So: is the Times' No. 2 the same thing they're calling "soulless" in the old MoMA usage? If so, I suggested in a letter to the Times that they should ask Matthew Carter for a copy of the new and improved No. 2. <br> <br>(I wonder: will Carter call the revised face Franklin Gothic No. 2.1, or does it merit a whole-number upgrade?) <br> <br>Tim: I thought the same thing about the o kerning, but, of course, the typeface isn't finished yet.</div>

<div class=commentbody>BTW, I think Carter is working on a new body face for the NYT. <br> <br>Kerning: you can't expect even an expert type designer to kern everything, like the "oM" for example... which is one reason you don't use a font totally as-is for a logo, especially if you think you're sophisticated. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I guess because it would throw off the matching between <br>on-screen versus printed texts (since you can't kern bitmaps). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Presumably when the font was redesigned Carter realised that it was going to be used in the logo and would have considered this when setting the kerning. <br>Equally, whoever supplied the logo to NY Times should have checked it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I would not infer anything about the kerning or spacing <br>of Carter's MoMA Gothic from the overlay. I suspect that <br>this illustration was built on the old logo. From the scan <br>of the article which RK mentioned above, the old logo <br>looks unevenly spaced in the MoM, while Carter's looks <br>fine to my eye. <br> <br>I would expect that in a heavy sans serif like this the M <br>and the o would quite likely have symmetrical sidebearings. <br>Probably no kerning necessary. <br> <br>Georgia does not have kerning, presumably, because <br>kerning has little meaning for screen display, and <br>probably because MS didn't ask/pay Carter to provide <br>kerning. That's my guess. <br> <br>-- K.</div>

<div class=commentbody>just a quick response to Cheshire Dave ... <br> <br>i've freelanced at the New York times, and their Franklin Gothic 2 is the same as everyone else's. it might rip differently since they do their film in house. and they love FG just as it is. i think they were paraphrasing MoMA's stance in the article.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Kathrin. That's interesting -- I swear, the differences I noted are real, unless I have some other version of No. 2, and the Times has the "real" digital version. If I get a chance, I'll scan the Arts & Leisure section head and show their No. 2 v. mine.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chesh, you noticed it was 'very slightly condensed' and <br>'dots of the i and j are a little taller.' <br> <br>Sounds like you caught someone scaling their type <br>horizontally. That itself is worth a letter to the editor. =)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I did send a letter to the editor, but not on those points. I should note that the dots on the i and j really are enlarged and closer to the bodies of their respective letters, while the top of the lower-case t has been raised to nearly cap-height level. <br> <br>Just an experiment: here's "Arts & Leisure" set in the No. 2 I have, 60pt, no modification in display whatsoever. I'll try to bring in the section and scan it tomorrow. In the meantime, if anyone wants to pit my No. 2 against theirs, be my guest.

<div class=commentbody>>moron <br> <br>But surely renovation is a necessary strategy for preservation? <br> <br>The alternatives are a strict "do-nothing", which runs the danger of decay and erosion -- or a wholesale change. <br> <br>It's good to preserve some of the past, and the investment of time and effort in a supposedly superficial "polishing" nonetheless provides buy-in and involvement from a variety of parties, a little publicity, and work for designers. </div>

<div class=commentbody>It didn't seem like anything was wrong before. No renovation is needed unless something is wrong. Was the Museum losing patrons or something because of their "outdated" image? <br> <br>It seems like a lot of companies renovate their image just to do it.</div>
