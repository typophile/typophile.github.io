  body: "As a UH grad, I remember this logo but did you know they changed their graphic
    guidelines?  The logotypes have changed and are available here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.uh.edu/policies/graphicstandards/graphic/index.php\r\n\r\nThe
    new logotypes, the word \"University\" appears in ITC Avante Garde Gothic Book
    by BT type style all upper case, separated by the word \u201Cof\u201D which is
    in Avante Garde Gothic Book all lower case  and \"Houston\" in all upper case
    in the Avante Garde Gothic Demi by BT type style.  Additionally the \u201CYou
    Are the Pride\u201D wordmark can appear in ITC Avante Garde Gothic Demi by BT
    type style, all upper case condensed.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps."
