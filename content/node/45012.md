body: "If one was to use the Beaufort extended font as an exhibit font on sports banners,
  posters, and brochures what would be a nice font to compliment it.  \r\n\r\nI have
  looked at FF Kievit, FF Meta and Fedra Sans, but those just do seem to fit.  I have
  also considered Akzidenz Grotesk but wanted something with a little more pop.  Are
  there any other possibilities I should consider?"

  body: To fit with the turn-of-the-century feel, maybe something like <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/BureauGrot>Bureau
    Grot</a>. I think an ideal match would be warm in a slightly idiosyncratic way,
    not warm in a "modern" way like Kievit, Fedra, etc., but I'm drawing a blank on
    what would fit the bill. Maybe Nick Shinn, <a href=http://shinntype.com>Beaufort's</a>
    designer, will chime in.

    Yes this has the \"pop\" that I am looking for.\r\n\r\nWhen I say \"pop\" I am
    referring to a font that would look as though it was meant to go together with
    Beaufort and didn't look like something that was created yesterday and would be
    gone tomorrow.\r\nAdditionally, it shows a character you wouldn't find anywhere
    else.\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI know I am in
