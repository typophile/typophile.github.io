  body: Franz, how do you id type so fast? Really... I would like to know. It would
    be wonderful if I could do this as well. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Do you have certain type books that you use as
    a resource or are you just so familiar with type that you can simply recall what
    it is? <BR> <BR>I have learned some of the more common types by lurking here in
    &#39;Typophile land&#39; for a while. But these more obscure types, at least to
    me, like PMC Caecilia are something that I have trouble id&#39;ing.

  body: I am just a newbie graphic design student at the college level and was hoping
    to learn how to be quicker in the design process. It is not my intention to be
    the first one to identify type here on the board. I simply thought it would be
    nice to gain some of the &#39;trade secrets&#39;.  <BR> <BR><b>excuse me</b> if
    I crossed some unspoken line. <BR> <BR><i>this is supposed to come off in a very
    defensive tone</i>

  body: <i>Franz, how do you id type so fast?</i> <BR> <BR>Joseph, that wasn&#39;t
    fast by Typophile standards.. I was just lucky that Yves, Karl and the other guys
    were not around. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR><i>Do you have certain type books that you use
    as a resource or are you just so familiar with type that you can simply recall
    what it is?</i> <BR> <BR>I did read a couple of books, but I don&#39;t own any
    type specimen books. And I haven&#39;t been doing this for very long either..
    In fact I discovered typography only about a year ago when I started to prepare
    for design school. I fell in love with type, and I&#39;ve been learning and researching
    since then.. This place is great for learning, considering how you get to watch
    the Godfathers of Type ID &#40;Mike, Mark et al&#41; work their magic. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>&#40;Oh, and the not-drinking/smoking-thing
    might help too, although I&#39;m not exactly sure how that factors in <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"
    border=0>. &#41; <BR> <BR>By the way, I first thought the sample David posted
    was <a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/theserif/serif-.html">TheSerif</a>,
    I looked that up and it didn&#39;t match, so I tried the other famous &#34;humanist
    slab&#34;, and bingo! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    harsh... the smilies don&#39;t always make up for the perceived tone.
