<p>First post here at this forum filled with talent! Since this is the &ldquo;release&rdquo; forum, please list some of your portfolios, or fonts you&rsquo;ve made. I only ask this because I&rsquo;m launching a new site called Fawnt.com and I want to find the BEST fonts. I&rsquo;ve been searching the web for days looking for the best fonts for designers, developers, and people that like pretty fonts. The site doesn&rsquo;t have a ton of fonts right now because I only added a few dozen. I&rsquo;ve collected a lot of fonts, but I&rsquo;m looking for more!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only looking for free fonts really, and if yours gets on the site, it will be nothing but a ton of exposure!</p>
<p>Feel free to post fonts you&rsquo;ve made, and any thoughts!</p>
<p>P.S. The site hasn&rsquo;t officially launched yet :P</p>

<p>The type designers who&rsquo;s work you exploit get &lsquo;exposure&rsquo; and you get <strong>cash</strong> in the form of ad revenue. Have you considered paying the designers that money? Think of the great PR such a move would create?</p>

I&rsquo;ve also found some fonts from deviantart and other design resources. That being said, the chances of a designer with a nifty portfolio showcasing pirated fonts is very slim. The possibility of it on deviantart and other resources is greater, but by reading the comments and other notes it gives you reassurance that the original poster is the creator. (people will call you out in the comments if it&rsquo;s pirated)</p>
<p>I also hope that if the site gets off on a good foot the community will be able to help spot any &ldquo;foes&rdquo; in the listings.</p>

<p>In finding &ldquo;appealing&rdquo; fonts, I tend to look for clean fonts with an easy to read typeface that would be good to use for design, web, print, etc.</p>

<p>But you could make your selection of what you think is best from this &ldquo;author-ized&rdquo; list, and show them on your site in specimen form.

<p>I have. I can say that there are only about 2 dozen decent free fonts out there of a caliber worth recommending to anyone that wants a professional level typeface for no cost.</p>
<p>You are free to disagree, of course. ;o)</p>
<p>Anyways, Miguel Sousa&rsquo;s link will pretty much sum up any suggestions you&rsquo;re going to get from this particular community.</p>
<p>Regarding downloading&hellip;I have been assuming that you are merely talking about the faces and not actually hosting the files. Is that correct? If not, do note that most of the decent free typefaces out there clearly state that you may not redistribute them in any fashion.

		<div class="commentbody">Marco, the folks here have been very helpful and not dissed your intentions at all. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot worse.
Free fonts is a touchy subject as many of us make our living from fonts, and can&rsquo;t even agree amongst ourselves what is the acceptable way to deal with the issue.
You&rsquo;ve got some valuable feedback, information, opinions and ideas.
Good luck with your site!</div>

The issue is, as other have hinted, that there just aren&rsquo;t that many high quality (book text quality?) free fonts available without distribution issues. That&rsquo;s all. Don&rsquo;t let us stop you. Please do it and prove us wrong. I am interested to see what you come up with.</div>

<p>Wrong. read the thread again slowly. The thread is filled with very useful suggestions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course for all the other fonts sites it’s fine for them to list fonts right guys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did you say above? This:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are hundreds of free font sites, that’s right. But they just have thousands of mediocre fonts. With Fawnt, we look minimize the ugly fonts, and link to only the most appealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t want to model your site on the 200 others anyway. Differentiate it. To do that, don&rsquo;t ignore the suggestions made here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for your own protection, and to increase the value of your site, that people are cautioning you about re-distribution. A simple solution is to provide links from your site to the legitimate source, rather than offer the fonts themselves.</p>

<p>You attract traffic based on work that someone else has done and take ad revenue for doing so. Exploit doesn&rsquo;t have to be bad - but if the designers get exposure and you get money that doesn’t seem to be a good deal for the designers?</p>
<p>Anyway why fawnt? that doesn&rsquo;t evoke pretty fonts in my opinion, more like brown fonts ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When many free fonts are released, the license agreement allows for distribution on free font web sites. So you&rsquo;re not doing anything wrong if you abide by the rules. When I made my freeware fonts, I did so with full knowledge that they would be used for commercial purposes and would be distributed on free font websites. I don&rsquo;t know why anyone would have a problem with that. Free fonts are released. Free font sites are a legitimate method of distribution. It&rsquo;s nice when font site owners give back to the designers. In over a decade at this, Jason Nolan at 1001freefonts.com is the only free font website owner who actually gives something back. Payment for distribution on a free font site is not required for any free fonts as far as I know.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a freeware site with a similar aim which I made a couple of months ago.
<a href="http://www.fontsugar.com/">http://www.fontsugar.com/</a></p>
<p>Researching the origins of free fonts and sending a few hundred email for fonts which require permission is the hardest part. I had some help and it took a solid month to put together. Most freeware font designers are hard/impossible to track down. There are very few actual free fonts, most are shareware or have complex licensing restrictions.</p>
<p>Feel free to use any freeware fonts from Larabie Fonts. If you get rich, send me a free t-shirt. If you download them using the shopping cart feature on MyFonts, you&rsquo;ll be informed of updates . . . so you can keep the versions on your site fresh. I hate getting tech support email about buggy versions of fonts I made in 1996.</p>
<p>There are a few free fonts on Typodermic.com - you can use those as well.</p>

<p>I can see two problems (some) folks might have:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>free (anything) is often used as a promotion. It&rsquo;s specifically done to drive traffic to their web site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quality control. Many folks, I imagine, want to retain a certain trade dress for their offerings.</p>

<p>Marco, this site is mainly attended by people making a living with fonts. Many have stories of abuse of commercial fonts by &lsquo;free&rsquo; sites. And free is in competition with their ultimate goal of selling fonts to make a living.</p>
<p>People looking for free aren&rsquo;t usually the ones willing to spend $20-$40 or more for a font.</p>
<p>And most of the rest (I&rsquo;m in this category) are probably too jaded to share the beauty of your vision, much of which might involve a matter of personal taste. So it is reasonable that no one will be excited by your idea. But good luck with it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Fontsugar and Larabie Fonts have Google ads but they don&rsquo;t even cover the bandwidth. Fontlover is Jess Latham&rsquo;s site. The Larabie Fonts site is mainly about directing people to Typodermic and introducing people to MyFonts. Even though they&rsquo;re free fonts, it&rsquo;s all about gettign people to use the MyFonts shopping cart. Let&rsquo;s say someone who has never considered buying fonts before is looking for some freebies for a project. If they end up at Larabie fonts, tossing freebies in the shopping cart, they may end up getting hooked on a pay font that&rsquo;s too good to pass up. The perfect font for their project. So, the freebie customer is now a first time font buyer. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll discover the advantages of pay fonts (no weird license restrictions, better quality and support). A lot of freeware sites I&rsquo;ve seen attempt to trick people into visiting pay sites. I didn&rsquo;t want to do that so I put all free fonts on MyFonts. That way customers get version updates too and I can sell OpenType/PS versions. Font Sugar is even more straightforward: here are free fonts, here are pay fonts.</div>
