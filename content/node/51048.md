  who thinks because I haven't got commercial experience, I have to show this in my
  price. Anyway, I now how to come to a price for this flyer on top of all of this
  and I am worried that he may think exactly the same with this flyer. I would be
  happy to charge for this flyer \xA3100, but he may think I am overcharging him again.
  I only have myself to blame as there wasn't a contract and I sent him the design
  without getting the money first. He has got 5k printed onto 350gsm silk card. SO
  how much could I get for something along the lines of this one I designed. I just
  need a figure that I can go off for future designs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eyecandyhair_frontblog_3859.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eyecandyhair_backblog_4152.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks.:-)"

    dude that unless he could do the job you did himself, with the software you used,
    then it is a commercial job you created. (And looks good!) You don't need commercial
    experience to do a commercial/professional job. Some people pick things up quickly
    and have a professional eye without a degree or experience. I've seen some damn
    awful Graphic Designer who have degrees and commercial experience who turn out
    badly designed rubbish still after many years of practicing.\r\n\r\nAnd I bet
    in his industry there are bad hair stylists(or whatever they are calling themselves
    this week!)who trash your hair, even with all there commercial experience.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is the hourly rate for Design in the UK?\r\n\r\nIf you can't find out, charge
    him \xA3150 for being a smart pain in your rear end, and tell him next time you'll
    charge more thanks to him giving you the now treasured COMMERCIAL EXPERIENCE!!\r\nIf
    he was happy to print your job and his commercial business deemed it to be commercial
    and professional, then it is.\r\n\r\nNice work BabyDahl.Keep up the good work.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDrj\r\n(Over
    15 years Graphic Design AND Commercial Experience....lol)"

  body: "wow, that was great. I will now tell him that!!!:-)))) Thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nBTW-
    Dr Jack, I am not charging by the hour, but am gonna charge by the project based
    on the amount of work I put into it. More of a fixed price, i think."

  body: 'Now I should like to know what your client charges for the full monty: Hairdye
    with additional streaks in a different colour, a new cut, conditioning, blow drying,
    spray. I bet for this job - which should take approximately two hours - he asks
    nearly the same amount he is offering you for a complete corporate identity which
    could mean several weeks of designing.'

  body: "Rule number one in billing - client always pays the first 1/3 (or even 1/2)
    of the estimated cost upfront before any work begins. Otherwise you <strong>will</strong>
    be stiffed. This helps the client realize its serious and reminds them that they
    have a vested interest in a successful design process.\r\n\r\nAs far as billing
    by the project goes - it should reflect your hourly rate which should be a reflection
    of the value of your time, skill, effort, cost of living, and business operating
    costs. As you get better over time at estimating how much a given project will
    cost (in time and effort), you'll be better at providing more accurate \"per-project\"
    quotes. But you'll probably get dinged the first couple of times until you've
    got your \"estimating framework\" in order and calibrated...\r\n\r\nAs for your
    design - I would have 'shopped out the hair on the model's cheek - it looks distracting.
    Type wise you've done well - good, clean typesetting and it's quite readable.
    The facebook logo looks out of place though - too far off to the left and a heavier
    and darker typeface make it take more precedence then it should in the visual
    hierarchy. "

  body: "Well, I told him the price I charged and he was happy to pay. \xA3100 was
    the price I set. Thanks for the comments. \r\n\r\nBemerx25, I agree with the facebook
    part, but nothing I can really do much about it now. Overall, he is happy and
    so am I. Your also correct about charging. I am now writing a contract out to
    give to clients to sign and get everything set down on paper. Have learned a lot
    from this."

    may not BILL or INVOICE by the hour, but you have to be sure you're invoice reflects,
    at an absolute minimum, your hourly rate * time spent.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you're
    not really making any money."
