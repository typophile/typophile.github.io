  'Jamaica' or 'Montego Bay'? They are on my list of places I'd rather be right now,
  but not in my font library list... \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-GGRG"

  body: It's hard to tell whether Montego Bay began life as Emigre's Matrix (or Matrix
    Tall) and was modified to be more conventional, or whether someone took an existing
    condensed serif and added the signature Matrix serif treatment.

  body: "My thought was something Matrix-ish as well. I found Latin MT Condensed which
    is pretty close except for the 'g'. As for 'Jamaica' I just have the ugly jpg
    placed in my layout... I'll pick up the search again tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThanks Marcox!"
