  body: How <cite>alternative</cite> do you wanna go? There is no 100% equivalent
    to a top class font for free, and I doubt there is a 90% one, whatever that might
    be. You might wanna read <a href="http://letterror.com/content/value/index.html">The
    value of type</a> by Erik van Blokland and the <a href="http://typophile.com/node/14652?">FAQ
    on Free Fonts</a>.

  body: "> <em>a free alternative for Trinite No. 2</em>\r\n\r\nYou're kidding, right?
    This is like asking for a budget Rolls Royce. Sure, you can find a cheaper car,
    but the only resemblance will be that it also has four wheels and a steering wheel.
    You want a free alternative for Trinit\xE9 No. 2? You will find a serif face that
    has an 'a' and a 'b' and a 'c' and so on, but that'll be the only thing similar.\r\n\r\nIf
    you need free fonts, there definitely is no room to be picky. Just use whatever
    you can find."

  body: "A free alternative to Trinit\xE9 does not exist, as stated, but I think [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=overview|Dolly]]
    could be an excellent and relatively cheap alternative for it."
