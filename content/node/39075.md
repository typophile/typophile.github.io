  expanded into full character sets and other language. The original foundry is unable
  to take on the extra work, but is open to allowing another party to build it out.\r\n\r\nWhere
  would I go to get something like this done?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have advice or experience
  with this kind of situation?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance..."

  body: There are several folks who would do that here at Typophile. I would consider
    doing it depending on the timeline involved, my familiarity the glyphs to be supported
    etc. I would not be the guy to do the greek or cyrillic for instance.

  body: "Hi all\r\nWill for sure be considering price, but for the moment I'm not
    too tuned in to who the local foundries are (local being regional at the least,
    since I'm in a smaller center/resort town). I'm also looking for someone with
    a good knowledge of international font support issues that can guide me through
    the intricacies of supporting fonts in other languages.\r\n--\r\nCheers, Clint"
