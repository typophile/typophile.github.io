body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am planning to write my Masters Thesis about corporate typography
  and its effects in brand communication and I'm in dire need of some help in finding
  any kind of theoretic basis for my work.\r\n\r\nI have a Bachelors degree in Graphic
  Design, i feel at home, when it comes to the history of typography.\r\nThere is
  a lot of material about the history of type anatomy of type etc. However im doing
  my Masters in Social Sciences, and there is very little, if any theoretic work about
  the effects of typography in visual communication or brand communication.\r\n\r\nAll
  major brands have fixed typefaces in their cvi books, some even design their own.
  So everybody seems to be sure that brand need their own typefaces, but why is it
  so, what are the effects of these typefaces in their communication is unknown.\r\n\r\nI'd
  be really grateful if anyone could help :) \r\n\r\n"
