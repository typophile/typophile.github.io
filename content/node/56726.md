body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI love printer ornaments. \r\n\r\nSo I have two questions:\r\n\r\n1.
  where do I get a nice, big selection of them. I only have a few fonts that have
  them (woodtype ornaments and such). Is a Dover clip art book the best way or is
  there some secret place where I can get some in vector format? I would like copyright
  free so that I don't have to worry...\r\n\r\n2. and also how are they best used?
  Small as a light touch or big as a graphic element? I want to use them in a way
  that they look like they add something and are not only \"decoration\".\r\n\r\ncheers!"

    aside, some fonts have period ornaments that match the font. Seek out some of
    these, and then study some title pages of older books."

  body: "Thanks...\r\n\r\nSo should the ornaments match or contrast with the typeface?
    I guess spice up the typeface?\r\n\r\nFor example if I wanted to use something
    like Mrs Eaves (one of my favorites) what would be a good style of printer ornament
    to use? I love to use vintage elements in my design, but I don't want to look
    like I am just copying a vintage aesthetic... I want it to be fresh.\r\n\r\np.s.
    I better look for some potatoes at the store... "

  body: "Not profound, but you can learn from looking at a reasonably respectable
    revival. Mrs Eaves works from Baskerville as inspiration. Storm includes in Baskerville
    Ten some ornaments, but also suggests that Baskerville appreciated an unadorned
    page, even citing rules as too ornamental. Look at what Storm includes with Baskerville
    Ten and then compare to Walbaum. You will see a distinct difference in style or
    ornament. I\u2019m not saying the ornaments must match the period, but I am saying
    you might make better decisions and have different opinion after looking at some
    examples yourself, either from the actual period or from revivals."
