<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi all,
Logotype approved but interested in any feedback/suggestions on improving letter forms. black and white version shown.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/univers_3663.gif]
Very interested in suggestions on secondary font (used on letters, arch drawings etc). Suggested 'Univers light' but are considering 'Univers condensed light'. Any suggestions for secondary condensed font? It needs to be sans serif and simple. Univers light condensed would work fine but for reasons we probably can't go into we don't want to use it. We are looking for something that works well with the logotype; could be contemporary, is condensed and has a high x height.
info on logo:_ client was interested in monocase letterforms. after conceptual development and research we progressed to developing letterforms similar to 'Bauhaus' & 'Universal'. Company comprises of three architects combining to create one company. The Bauhaus interested us in this idea of many ideas coming together etc. Letterforms for logo created based on this research
thanks</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Is there any reason why it's set so tight? At small size your i/t combo will become one and you'll surely lose the small gap you have between the bowl and terminal of the stroke on the _e_
As far as a condensed light face for a secondary face, if you intend to use it at small sizes there could be readabilty issues.
Just some initial thoughts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The <em>a</em> is stiff and sharp -- perhaps too much so -- don't you think? Rounding up its top, like what Peignot did, might be a solution.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The 'A' certainly seems out of place, not to mention my hatred of using mixed case lettering in logos. would like to see it in context of how it would be used. it's not overly emotive, but then it is for an architect (joke)

<div class=commentbody>For the 'A', try using your 'n' shape with a crossbar. I would also use an upper case 'L' and 'H' (only as tall as the x-height) to make the logo truly unicase.

<div class=commentbody>The logo has been approved, the request is for a secondary font.
The logotype has a definite style direction, I'm not sure Univers is the right secondary font. I might use one of the more simple versions of Chalet. You can see that Chalet Comprime 60 is too much of a good thing, but 70 or 80 might work very nicely. You could then adopt the rest of the chalet family for other part of the kit, if you'd like.

<div class=commentbody>I'm with Miss Tiff, Chalet would definitely work as a secondary font. Maybe not condensed, though.
Now let's focus on the <em>a</em> :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Some great posts here, thanks for your time and thought.
Yes, the logotype is approved, so the letterform comments I'm looking for are more along the lines of David's comment on the e, cheers! The letters, including the a, are generally based on Bayer's Universal Font, but I've made the letters terminate horizontally, which fills out the circular shapes and makes it look more neutral.
The general design scheme of this font is to make the letterforms with the most ecconomical use of strokes. Also, I like tight letterspacing and monocase fonts!
My reasoning behind the choice of secondary font is related to our client's use of text. In architecture, a lot of text is necessarily generated in meeting minutes etc that form legal documents for each project. Also, architectural drawings are usually highly noted. We specified Univers Light Condensed for this client in a former life, and it really worked well. With the font I am now seeking, I would like something to compliment the logotype rather than mimic it in a condensed fashion. Univers Light looks good, but would increase paper use at the clients office! Chalet is a great tip, thanks Miss Tiffany. I'll need to test it as longer text, though.</div>

<div class=commentbody>No sorry; there is no tag line with logo (above was Miss Tiffany suggesting Chalet as secondary font). Secondary typeface will be selected to compliment the logo and used on the text of business card and other stationary items and also throughout notes on architectural drawings.
Chalet 80 as shown above by Miss Tiffany would suit as would Univers light condensed because they are condensed and have a higher x height. They also suit because the letters terminate in horizontals. Condensed would help in minimising area of text on architectural drawings and of course allow more words. When choosing a font though l would like to ensure it works for all situations and that it looks good.</div>

On the other hand a condensed typeface normally has to be at a larger point size than uncondensed and the same is true of light versus regular.

<div class=commentbody>True.
l think when making the selection l will definately need to take this into consideration.
below are three sans serif condensed fonts that l believe may suit the logotype. All three would have different tone of black due to stock weight when used is paragraph text etc. Univers light condensed has slightly wider characters than the other two; making it seem lighter/cleaner and not as black on page when used. hopefully because Univers Light Condensed is not as oval/condensed this also would mean that point size would not have to be increased to much.
You could argue that this is the case for Helvetica Neue Light condensed and l do like the 'c' although the 'e' is more oval than Univers. l think Helvetica Neue Light Condensed may not suit as well because of the logotypes character roundness.
Any thoughts?
