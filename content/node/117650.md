body: "From the 1st of July till 21 September the latest edition (3.7) of <strong>DTL
  OTMaster</strong> will be offered with a 50% discount on the standard licensing
  price of \u20AC255.\r\n\r\nVersion 3.7 contains a lot of new functionality. From
  the import/export of <em>Ideographic Variation Sequences</em> (IVS) to the editing
  of <em>feature parameters</em>, and from an <em>autohinter</em> for edited or newly
  added glyphs to support for COLR+CPAL tables. One can read about all details in
  Karsten L\xFCcke\u2019s wonderful <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/OTM_manual.zip\">manual</a>.\r\n\r\nSome
  use OTM for font-spelunking, other use it for Open(Type)-heart surgery. Some use
  it for compiling OpenType Layout features (directly in the font, or exported for
  proprietary work\uFB02ows) by applying the elegant automatic subsetting, while others
  use it for instance for mark (to mark) positioning. OTM is the ultimate Swiss (or
  actually German/Dutch) knife for CFF- and TTF-based OpenType, TrueType, and TTC
  (TrueType Collection) fonts.\r\n\r\nA complete listing of the functionality in OTM
  3.7 can be found <a href=\"http://www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/RM/Read_Me_lb.txt\">here</a>.
  DTL OTMaster can be ordered directly with forenamed discount at  <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/Shops/FM_Shop/index1.html\">DTL\u2019s
  FontTools shop</a> or at FontLab Ltd.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OTM_promo_3596.jpg]"

  body: "I\u2019m very pleased to inform you that the OTM summer promo is a huge success.
    Obviously 50% discount makes a major difference for all of those doubters. ;-)\r\n\r\nOn
    Google\u2019s font list currently there is a lively discussion on the development
    of Devanagari fonts and I was surprised to \uFB01nd out that it was unknown to
    many that OTM generates a nice log \uFB01le when compiling OT Layout features.
    This way errors and mistakes in the features can easily be traced. This is a excerpt
    from the discussion with an example that I generated with OTM 3.7:\r\n\r\n<strong>--------------------------------------------------------------</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Just
    had a short look at the features. The lookup 'PreBaseSubstitutionslookup2' contains
    duplicate substitutions:</em>\r\n\r\n sub \\isigndeva.tha \\radeva_viramadeva
    \ by \\isign_ra_virama.tha;\r\n   sub \\isigndeva.tha \\radeva_viramadeva  by
    \\isign_ra_virama.ja;\r\n\r\n    sub \\isigndeva.tha \\radeva_viramadeva \\anusvaradeva
    \ by \\isign_ra_virama_anusvara.tha;\r\n    sub \\isigndeva.tha \\radeva_viramadeva
    \\anusvaradeva  by \\isign_ra_virama_anusvara.ja;\r\n\r\n<em>If one of each is
    removed then there seem to be some more errors:</em>\r\n\r\nHOT [ERROR] MarkToBase
    or MarkToMark error: A previous statment has already assigned the current mark
    class to another anchor point on the same glyph 'rvocalicdeva'. Skipping rule.

    thing that came up in the discussion is the editing of the naming table. Also
    this can be exported in OTM and the text \uFB01le can subsequently be easily edited
    (in batch, if applicable) and imported. "

  body: I suppose this is a crude question to ask but what is DTL OTMaster useful
    for? I read that it's basically post-production software for fonts, but the descriptions
    remain very vague. What's the biggest upside of DTL OTMaster, and is it essential
    to be able to guarantee the quality of OT fonts?
