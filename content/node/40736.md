  body: "<a href=\"http://www.greendotprint.com/\">Greendot/Produktion</a> has done
    some great work for me and are very responsive and friendly. I use them regularly
    for all kinds of work. They are a broker, rather than a printer themselves, but
    that's worked to my benefit. They also have a very environmentally friendly bent,
    but will not force it on you at all.\r\n\r\nIf you call them, ask for Mike DiBugnara
    and tell him I sent you."

  body: great. I was thinking a broker might be better as the job entails foils, varnishes
    and embossing they will probably know who can best handle these techniques.

    sorts of jobs for me since 1980, mostly for non-profit clients. Good for fussy,
    short-run jobs. They also broker and have different presses at their disposal,
    including big corporate plants in New Jersey. Mention John S."

  body: "I would like to second Jackie T's suggestion for using\r\nPATANE PRESS INC.\r\nWe've
    been using them for quite sometime. They can handle as Jackie says two color printing
    and short runs with outstanding quality and consistancy. Foil stamping, embossing,
    die cutting...etc. I have HIGH end FUSSY clients and these guys know what it takes
    to make them happy.\r\n\r\nThey also do outstanding 4 color and large runs.\r\nYou
    can always get the owner on the phone to help you plan the job and stay within
    your clients budgets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just recieved an email stating the
    launch of their website by the end of April patanepress.com but for now I still
    contact them below.\r\n\r\nPatane Press\r\n228 E 125th St\r\nNew York, NY 10035-1738\r\nPhone:
    (212) 289-1440\r\n\r\nHope this was usefull :)\r\n-Michelle"
