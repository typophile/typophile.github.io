    New Baskerville Italic</a> will bring you darn close. The slightly heavier stroke
    width in your sample might be due to the reproduction.\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/baskerville/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D48%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3Dnew%2520season%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D29\">Bitstream
    Baskerville</a> is not that different either.\r\nF"
