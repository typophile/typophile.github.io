  body: Well, your type and color choices fit with the whole pizzeria look. <BR> <BR>What
    do you know about the company? Is there anything that makes it different than
    other pizza shacks? Is there a way to represent that in the logo? <BR> <BR>Or,
    is it just a pizza shop and it does not need to stand out in any way? I am guessing
    with a name like &#39;pizzeria&#39; that the owner is not too wound up on branding
    and positioning. <BR> <BR>Logo looks clean and competent. I just wonder if more
    could be communicated, but can&#39;t say without understanding more about the
    company. <BR> <BR>Hope that is helpful. <BR> <BR>Mike

    RGB for everyone to see it.&#41;

  body: it is definitely well-drawn. but i would try more color choices. using the
    generic pizza red and green make your logo less powerful. <BR> <BR>with a name
    like &#34;pizzeria&#34; it&#39;s generic enough. i think you should make them
    more unique. <BR> <BR>also, please post a smaller image next time.

  body: I think it is very generic - however I think that is what makes this a hoot!
    I would love an old faded t-shirt with that logo on it. I actually think that
    by totally playing into stereotype which I believe is intentional that you actually
    ad a sense of hip to it. I totally dig it - I just hope all the branding is as
    &#34;hole in the wall pizza joint&#34; as it can be to make the atmosphere excellent.
    I actually also could see this being somewhat high end. Its one of those that
    kinda wraps all the way back around and works for the other crowd kinda thing.
    So in that respect I think that it is very tongue in cheek. If all of that is
    the aim - I love it. If not... um... I do like the typeface.

  body: thanks fellas for the reply.. sorry for the late response. ya the pizza shack
    just opened recently and im working on the branding as well. this place has a
    lounge atmosphere and interior is designed in more of a lounge/beach feel. ive
    want the logo to be easily readable and easy to relate to pizza&#40;italian&#41;
    thats why i chose the classic red n green. the type was selected to give it a
    bit of proper but yet a classical feel. <BR>please comment more. thanks
