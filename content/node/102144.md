  body: The two <strong>E</strong>s aren't the same (serifs are narrower on the first
    one), and the two <strong>Y</strong>s are also different (the second one is wider
    than the first), so this was pretty clearly drawn by hand.

  body: It is a mural on a wall, so I would expect some inconsistency as they painted
    it, but I'm thinking the lettering still originated from a font.  Hmmm...

    been inspired by Corvinus Skyline Alternate (above), but they improvised freely
    on the <strong>E</strong>, the <strong>A</strong>, the <strong>R</strong> and
    the <strong>Y</strong>."
