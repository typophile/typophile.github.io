  through the new terminal shown on the photos linked to below, I did notice the new
  airport typeface \u2013 which you can see on the signs in many of the nine photos
  here. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n<a>http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/700491/Skylink_So-sieht-der-neue-Terminal-in-Wien-aus?gal=700491&index=7&direct=&_vl_backlink=&popup=</a>\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMichael"
