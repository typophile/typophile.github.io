    Black Swash Italic</a> for sale ($60), but the swashes appear to be different
    from the ones in your sample. Since they claim that their set includes swashes
    that are the same as the original ones, there's a chance that your swashes are
    custom.\r\n\r\nDon't know about <cite>Waves of Change</a>."

  body: "Hey Joshua \r\n\r\nGet yourself an old Letraset catalogue from the early
    '70s; I think the Cooper Black and the Premier Shaded both featured in their Letragraphica
    collection.\r\n\r\n'Waves of Change' appears to be handlettered from two different
    faces; a condensed grotesque with the crossbar of 'H' repositioned higher \u2013
    and something like Avant Garde for the big round characters. That 'e' may have
    been resized and redrawn from the lowercase of the same face. You could artwork
    this easily enough in Illustrator or Freehand, but I doubt any of it exists as
    a single digital font."

  body: "Oy. Apologies if that was a wrong steer Joshua \u2013 you don't have to artwork
    that 'Waves of Change' yourself because Cinema (Solid or Shaded) it is. Congratulations
    to David, Ignacio and Mike. \r\n\r\nIf you still think you need an old Letraset
    catalogue I would recommend your local op shops and secondhand bookstores."
