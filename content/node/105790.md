body: "Hi,\r\nI am currently using Eras Bold ITC font for my company name within my
  logo (see www.route22.co.uk). I am fairly happy with the general look of my website
  but I'm no typography professional and would very much appreciate suggestions from
  people with abetter appreciation of these things.\r\nI'd like to stick with Eras
  for my logo but I wonder if things could be improved through the use of different
  heading and body fonts that better complement Eras Bold ITC. Also, I have read that
  generally sans-serif fonts are best for the web but serif are generally better for
  print. Is this true and, if so, what body font would you recommend to complement
  my logo on printed material?\r\n\r\nAny advice welcome\r\n\r\nPaul Hooper"
