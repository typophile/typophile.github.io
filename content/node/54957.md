  for an InDesign book.\r\nI have 25 chapter in 25 indesign docs with sections defined
  as 1.1 to 1.x.\r\nI created a book with all files.\r\nI go to chapter one and tryed
  to created a Table of Contents of all book.\r\nAparently it creates all text correctly
  and put them alphabetically ordered but it order also the pages in ascending way
  (what gives a complet wrong Table of Contents).\r\n\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\nA   1.1\r\nAA
  \ 1.2\r\nB   2.1\r\nCC  2.2\r\netc\r\n\r\nAnyone knows what is going on?\r\nI try
  to google it...but no luck\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio Fonseca\r\n"

    I''ve never used the book feature in InDesign, so I''m not sure how it works.
    There is also a "book page numbering options" in the books panel. '

  body: "OK. I will try to explain better my situatin.\r\n\r\n- We have 25 documents
    marked on the numbering options as different sections. Sections go like this:
    1, 2, 3, 4, etc.\r\n- We also use the \"include section prefix\" option and set
    it up to: 1., 2., 3., 4., etc.\r\n- We use \"Start page numbering at: 1\" instead
    of automatic page numbering because we need it to start anew, we want the pages
    to be numbered like this: SectionPrefix.PageNumberOfTheSection\r\n\r\nSo, our
    catalog chapters go like this: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2, etc.\r\n\r\nHope
    that's clear enough for you to understand how the numbering is structured.\r\n\r\nOnto
    the problem now. The table of contents.\r\nIdeally we would create a book, include
    all the 25 documents and add a new document for the TOC itself, then we would
    go create the TOC through the method we all know and select the option \"Include
    book document: X.indb\". This indeed creates a TOC and does indeed grab all the
    titles from all the 25 documents in the book. Problem is, it sorts them by ascending
    page number, while we need it in entry alphabetical order.\r\nOk then, select
    the  \"Sort entry in alphabetic order\" option in the TOC menu you would say.
    Well we did, and this is what's happening:\r\n\r\nAcess\xF3rio                     1.1\r\nAdaptadores

    is not on page 1.1 (nor are all the other products listed in the correct page)!
    It's just the alphabetical order kicking in with the ascending page number sorting
    at the same time, creating a mess for which I have no explanation. As you can
    probably guess this is no good. It just connects the products starting with A
    with the first pages, B with the next ones and so on.\r\n\r\nBasically we'd like
    to know how to remove the page numbering sorting from TOC.\r\n\r\nI'd be a very
    happy man if someone could explain what's happening here, though it might be a
    bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much for reading!\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

  body: "Let me see if I understand -- You have 25 chapters. Each chapter might include
    multiple sections. Each of these sections, within each chapter, will begin numbering
    anew. So, you might have page 2.4 (Section 2, page 4) in Chapter 1, but also in
    Chapter 5?\r\n\r\nIf that's correct, then InDesign might be choking on all the
    duplicated numbers (though I don't see why it should). Not sure why it's not keeping
    the associated page numbers with the entries.\r\n\r\nNormally a Table of Contents
    is not organized alphabetically, but rather in content/pagination order. Sounds
    more like you are creating an Index (even if you are putting it at the beginning
    of the catalog). Have you considered using the Index feature to generate your
    list instead? It's a lot more work to put in the markers, but it's probably more
    robust and might be better at handling your unique situation.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    at that point, it might just be easier to make up the list manually, the good
    ol' fashioned way. Unless you're planning on doing a lot of switching things around
    and want to have the TOC update automatically.\r\n\r\nAnother solution might be
    to just generate the TOC in typical pagination order (which if I understood you
    correctly, InDD did just fine). Then copy the text into a word processing document,
    sort your list alphabetically, and reimport into your design file. If formatting
    is an issue, you might be able to export the text as tagged text and work around
    that in your sorting.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    Numbering Options and see if Document Chapter Numbering is set to \"Continue from
    Previous Document in the Book\".\r\n\r\nIf not, see if checking this makes a difference
    in how the TOC feature treats your documents.\r\n\r\nYou will need to set this
    separately for each chapter file in the Book palette. Then you may also need to
    select Book Palette > Update Numbering > Update Chapter & Paragraph Numbers.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure if this will make a difference, but it's something that might be worth
    trying. (You might want to back up your files: working with the Book palette and
    updating/synchronizing can sometimes have undesired effects and you'll want to
    be able to go back if this doesn't work and instead screws something up.)\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\n--

    has nothing to do with the Section prefix and numbering. The problem seems to
    be the Alphabetical sorting. Even with typical pagination, the TOC feature sorts
    entries, but does not treat page numbers as uniquely attached to entries and leaves
    them in ascending order.\r\n\r\nI would contact Adobe and submit this as a bug
