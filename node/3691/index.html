  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi Everybody, <BR> <BR>This is a logo I&#39;m working on for a technology company which primary focus was the oil industry, hence the name Rockoil &#40;petroleum&#41;. Now they don&#39;t want to be exclusively associated with the oil industry anymore, as the technological solutions they provide can serve to many other clients. <BR> <BR>The company actually represents 2 other big international companies, which fields are satellite-positioning systems, and &#34;clean&#34; technologies for industrial cycles &#40;water purifying systems, etc.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Comments would be much appreciated! :-&#41; <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Rafael Iskin<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28913.gif" alt="rockoil logo"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Aloha Rafael! <BR> <BR>If they want to downplay the oil association, I would decrease the size of the type in relation to the mark and reposition the mark to the left so it is the first read. <BR> <BR>The mark has a fresh, clean look that goes well with &#34;clean&#34; technologies, and the blue/green color scheme seems to make an association for GPS. Well done. <BR> <BR>I may catch some flack for this here, but I think a dark gray would go better with the mark than the black type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Scott and Tiffany, thanks for the comments! :-&#41; <BR> <BR>I do have an horizontal version of the logo, and I&#39;m using it in some applications &#40;see the business card&#41;. <BR>Maybe the horizontal is really better, but I still tend to keep the vertical for some instances. <BR> <BR>I chose the proportion of the mark/logotype based on the horizontal version, see that the horizontal &#34;arrows&#34; match the caps height of the logotype &#40;and they in fact refers to the &#34;K&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>I liked the suggestion of using gray in the logotype, but I am still not sure, doesn&#39;t it makes the logo too bright? <BR>I like the contrast of the black, but also, if I print the business card in serigraphy I would have to set the type in gray as well to avoid one more printing color, and I&#39;m not so sure it will work. <BR> <BR>Well, what do you think? <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28935.gif" alt="horizonral-rockoil"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here goes the dark gray version, I really like it. <BR> <BR>And you are right about the card Scott, I posted an old &#40;and wrong&#41; version of it, despite the trimming problem the type on the bottom is disturbing. <BR> <BR>As to the &#34;Oil&#34; problem Bernard, well, if they didn&#39;t want &#42;any&#42; association with it they would have to change the company&#39;s name. That&#39;s not really the case. <BR> <BR>I have tried a larger first letter but I don&#39;t think it worked. The concept of the logotype is based in the repetition of forms, and I prefer the way it is now because the &#34;R&#34; relates more to the &#34;K&#34; and to the mark. <BR> <BR>Actually, when I posted I was wiling to hear more thoughts about the type. <BR>Well, I guess that in a &#34;crystal-goblet&#34; way, no news is good news no? ;^&#41; <BR>&#40;oh, why did I mentioned it now?&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks everybody, that was my first post here in typophile! <BR>You will be seeing me around from now on! <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t like the R. Maybe just because it reminds of the cheap Bitstream-Revue-typeface.  <BR>The circle in the logo also strikes me as odd, mimicking the O-form, not really a circle at all, and the O has nothing to do with their name or anything else, so that confuses me quite a bit. Also, the logo in itself looks a bit generic, I more or less associate it with a crosshair of a weapon system, and that, indeed, is not a good ind of visual metaphor for a company. And in some weird way it also reminds me of the &#40;otherwise quite nice&#41; newish BP-sun &#40;maybe due to the green&#41;, which doesn&#39;t help establish an individual identiy at all. I don&#39;t see oil, I don&#39;t see water, I don&#39;t see information in all of this. And if you cannot see it... why opt for a ideographic trademark at all? I the  and &#60;&#62; &#39;s don&#39;t make any sense and are just visual special effects, just leave them away and concentrate on the word rockoil itself. <BR> <BR>On the technical side, the logo probably won&#39;t work in black and white and even in colour, it will take three, probably even four colours to print/plot that artwork, which is not quite the most economic solution available.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t believe you HD!!! :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Seriously, I believe you. People have different tastes, and as you are not criticizing the construction or anything objective about the letter there is nothing I can say except &#34;I like it&#34;. I have found a Linotype-Revue, I don&#39;t like it too, but I don&#39;t see any resemblance. <BR> <BR>Yes, the mark &#42;is&#42; a bit generic, and the main reason is because the company acts in many different fields &#40;I don&#39;t want to say water, or oil&#41; it is an abstract concept, and BTW I don&#39;t see &#42;any&#42; trouble in using purely abstract ideograms. <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t see any association in the mark, I think you are not even trying to put yourself in the position of the target public of the logo. The crosshairs are not exclusively used in weapon systems, but in &#42;any&#42; positioning system, as they denote direction. <BR> <BR>For example:  in the controls that position oil platforms above the hole they want to drill. <BR> <BR>Also, to me the mark have a positive association in the other field the company operates; as it can be read as a &#34;green&#34; focus over a industrial cycle. Have you ever noticed that the pictogram for &#34;cycle&#34; often is not a perfect circle, but a more squashed one? look at some washing machines for example&#41; <BR> <BR>As to the technical side, it has been considered, and there is no problem in using 4 colors. <BR>Of course, when you design something is crucial to take in account the uses it will have, but that&#39;s exactly why it is nonsense to limit yourself to constraints that don&#39;t apply to you. <BR> <BR>In any case I&#39;m posting different versions of the logo, one for good quality 1 color printing, and the other to coarse low quality 1 color printing  &#40;like old fax machines&#41;. <BR> <BR>Well, that&#39;s it. <BR>Lucky me you are not my client HD  :-&#41; <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I should disagree with HD - the font is pretty good for that type of logo. And I should agree with HD on another point - 4 colours are too much for a logo. And I doubt that you will be able to reproduce this via the standard CMYK process - you will surely need a Pantone solution. And on the other hand - the colours resemble way too much the corporate colors of OMV - another gas &amp; oil company - see <a href="http://www.omv.com" target="_blank">http://www.omv.com</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Kris and Ivan, thanks for the feedback. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m really surprised with this resemblance you guys see with the BP logo, the only connection I can see is the use of green and a certain &#34;concentric&#34; construction. Could you possibly elaborate a bit more about this? I would be really interested. <BR> <BR>Frankly, there aren&#39;t so many different color schemes as there are companies &#40;in any field&#41;, and I&#39;m sure I can find a logo already using any &#40;good&#41; color combination. If I had used the colors of a competitor I would have committed a major flaw, but that&#39;s not really the case. &#40;I will explain a bit more about the nature of the company at the end&#41; <BR> <BR>Please have in mind that I&#39;ve never heard of those companies before &#40;BP or OMV&#41; as we don&#39;t have them around here; but I&#39;m actually glad to see they use a similar color scheme as mine; because I&#39;m sure they have used &#40;expensive&#41; research to determine their colors, while I had to just trust my guts. <BR> <BR>About &#34;technological solution&#34; </div>
