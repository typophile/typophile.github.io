body: "Friends,\r\n\r\nHello! I'm the managing director of a small non-profit arts
  organization that performs, teaches, and hosts dance and movement events. We're
  the only modern dance studio in Indiana, where there is a small (at best) dance
  community. Although we've been around for 28 years, we are frequently being compared
  to the local ballet school; a more classical dance and has been around for 50 years.\r\n\r\nA
  few years ago, (before I worked here) the organization got a grant to improve its
  corporate branding. They bought a font (DaVinci) and created a logo (attached).\r\n\r\nI
  came along, with a minimal graphic design background, and I don't like the logo.
  It seemed to open, to unsubstantial. So I modified it, inversed the color, and set
  it inside a circle (also attached.)\r\n\r\nThe 30th anniversary is coming up soon,
  and I'd really like to present them with a modified, better logo that isn't drastically
  different that what is here. I'd like it to show a sense of movement, of flow. I'd
  like it to be free-form without being wacky and all over the place. Basically, I
  want to keep a sense of modern dance within the logo, but I want something that
  will still look smart on a letterhead.\r\n\r\nI would love any advice you have to
  offer that might lead me on the right path. Thank you very much!"

  body: "The line quality is rough/autotrace looking, and you have too many ideas.
    The spirals and chicklets are not helping.\r\n\r\nA good test for a mark is to
    reduce it to around 1/4\" in height and fax it and see if it still reads. I would
    simplify the ideas and look to available type that is going to be more legible.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you don't even need the two figures. Maybe type only, or just a gesture that says
    movement. Maybe that gesture could be part of the type."

  body: "I think the font does a fine job of communicating movement on its own --
    you might want to think of perhaps tinkering a bit with one or two letters to
    emphasize that idea.\r\n\r\nBut the logo itself is just too confusing."

  body: Thanks for the comments! I've been toying with the idea of just getting rid
    of the logo itself, but I don't know if the artistic director would be down for
    that. Do you think it would be improved by removing the little spirals and the
    little confetti-looking marks?

  body: "Hi Andrew.\r\n\r\nMaybe you should zoom into the figures and take a part
    of a body that keeps the essence/movement [moving hand/torso/muscle structure...],
    or take a piece of clothing they could be wearing [twisted shirt/tie/a dress suggesting
    the movement of the body underneeth...] Something that has a place in the imege
    already but could be isolated and refined, croped in and made more powerful. [?]\r\n\r\nMaybe
    take a photo of two people performing this movement and take a detail and work
    with it... you could even have an evolving mark that zooms closer and ends up
    with an abstract shape [body part/clothing/hair...] that conveys the same message
    as this one does holistically.\r\n\r\nI find that a photograph or something tangible
    is a good starting point when designing anything, even type. Then you can usually
    give it a physical quality: weight, texture, movement. Then a simple shape can
    be attributed to a space or material or somehow suggest a material quality, be
    it finely chipped out of steel [Walbaum] or set in huge concrete blocks [Akzidenz
    Grotesk figures]. Or something like the Johnnie Walker logo.\r\n"

  body: "I quite like the original figures. Try removing the swirls and 'confetti'
    as it doesn't say anything IMO. As for the typeface try to find something dynamic
    and better crafted like <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/4\">Alma</a> or

  body: I like the feel of single dancer. I think you should create the two dancers
    in that style. The way they are now, it's pretty rough. I like the smooth style
    of the single dancer.
