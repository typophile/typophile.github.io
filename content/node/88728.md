  available on my <a href=\"http://www.behance.net/gallery/Hexa-(free-font)/2759421\">site</a>
  and you're all very welcome to try it if you like. I'll be grateful if you let me
  know what you think and send me a sample, should you use it for something.\r\n\r\nA
  Happy New Year to all of you\r\n& best regards from Budapest,\r\nAkos\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/09_resize_5442.jpg]"

  body: Nice, but could use some further development. Why don't you start a thread
    in the critique section?

  body: Thanks, I did that actually, and received some pretty useful <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/87992">feedback</a>.
    I'll try to incorporate these in the next version, but I'm not sure when I'll
    have time for that and wanted to see what people think about it.

  body: Rightly so. I was made aware of the resemblance at <a href:"http://www.typografie.info/2/showthread.php/25301-Hexa-An-experiment-in-textura">Typografie.info</a>.
    Although the construction principles are quite different, the result is remarkably
    similar.
