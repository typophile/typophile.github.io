  community such as this! I've been lurking here for a couple of months, and have
  learned a ton just from reading questions, posts, and the resource suggestions that
  many of you have made. (Just recently picked up Bringhurst's \"Elements of Typographic
  Style\"....wow, all I can say is wow) Anyways, looking for some feedback on some
  print work here...this was completed a few months ago, and already I can see typographic
  missteps that I've made ;) Please feel free to critique as relentlessly as you would
  like, ive got thick skin...thanks in advance guys!\r\n\r\n"

    I'm still new here, so let me know if the size is overkill (will need to scroll
    to see the whole image. As well if anyone would like to comment on layout as well
    as typography please feel free. \r\n\r\nThe target audience for the project was
    professionals/business people within the technology sector...age bracket 25-55.
    Thanks"

  body: In copy-heavy newsprint design, I often find indented paragraphs for body
    copy are a visual relief. However the last publication we redesigned, the editor
    vetoed them. I wouldn't use them for the intro paragraphs though, or the subheads
    - that's a bit of overkill IMHO. Watch out for the too heavily condensed type
    too, that can be difficult to read.

  body: "Paragraph indents serve as a visual clue for the beginning of a new paragraph
    WHEN NO OTHER CLUES ARE PRESENT. Thus, leading paragraphs, isolated blocks, etc
    do not require, and should not have, indentations; beneath subheads, no indentation.\r\n\r\n\"make
    Millions and Make Change!\" appears to be a title; itals?\r\n\r\nI have no way
    of telling if these pages all belong to the same publication. If they do, please
    be consistent with end-of-article signatures. The diamond in the first page is
    OK, but if you don't use it throughout, you'll find readers wondering where the
    end of article is.\r\n\r\nI agree about the condensed face.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Web developers,\"
    but \"website\"?\r\n\r\nRun the text past an editor once more: \"As a buyer...,
    understanding...\" is flapping around. \"understanding\" is not the \"buyer.\"\r\n\r\nGotta
    run.\r\n\r\nCurt Akin"

  body: Hey Curt, thanks very much for the feedback, good stuff!! In terms of the
    use of the condensed face, it was a last ditch effort to get all of the copy on
    the page...when size changes, tracking edits, etc are not going to do it, is it
    a better idea to just send a number of articles back to the editor to trim the
    word count? Thanks again for taking the time to review and respond.

  body: "In the 70s, I worked for an editor who thought absolutely nothing of calling
    an author at 3 in the morning to do a rewrite to fix an ugly set. Made my job
    of setting books for her a piece of cake--she and I both knew exactly what would
    pass muster; everything else fell on the authors!\r\n\r\nYou can save yourself
    a great deal of pulled hair by establishing a really good working relationship
    with your editor(s). \r\n\r\nCurt Akin"
