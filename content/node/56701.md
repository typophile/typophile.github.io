body: "Hello, my fellow typophiles,\r\n\r\nI would like to invite you all to talk
  about Xerox Sans, a customized typeface based on FS Albert by FontSmith for Xerox.
  (Before writing this post, I already Googled the Typohile.com for Xerox Sans, and
  only found people talked about the logo wordmark in an old thread about Xerox\u2019s
  rebranding). \r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\nA couple days ago, I stumbled upon a <a href=\"http://www.xerox.com/downloads/usa/en/x/xerox_corp_capabilities_web.pdf\">document
  at Xerox.com</a> in which Xerox Sans is embedded. Out of typographic interest, I
  discussed a little about it with one of my friends (he is a visual communication
  professor in a university and a nonprofessional type designer). Personally, I like
  the Xerox Sans as much as FS Smith, but I don't think it\u2019s optimal for Xerox
  as such a giant multinational company to use this soft, friendly and approachable
  typeface for its corporate branding. (I don\u2019t like the GE Inspira too much.)\r\n\r\nA
  snapshot of the document:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xeroxsans_4479.png]\r\n<!--break-->\r\n
  \r\nHowever, my friend pointed out that Xerox Sans has severe problems with lowercase
  \u201Ca\u201D& \u201Co\u201D and the tight & inconsistent spacing between letters.
  He did a \u201Cblurring test\u201D to back up his opinion on the \u201Ca\u201D\u201Do
  \u201Dlegibility problem, as shown below:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blurring
  test_6232.jpg]\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nEssentially, he believes it at least takes
  10 years to prove that one-story design of  lowercase \u201Ca\u201D in a sans serif
  typeface has good legibility (My friend think FontSmith should pick up two-story
  design with \u201Ca\u201D instead of the single-story). \r\n\r\nOne of his major
  claim is no other popular and successful typefaces with good legibility have taken
  on the two-story design with \u201Ca\u201D (and \u201Cg\u201D). And he reckons that
  Xerox Sans has its ancestry in FF Meta (his point is FF Meta is the progenitor of
  ALL humanist sans serifs).\r\n\r\nI think the \u201Ca\u201Dand \u201Co\u201Dis OK
  with the legibility (as in FS Albert and GE Inspira and others), and spacing is
  indeed tight in a way like Nokia Sans does. But I don\u2019t know why he insist
  saying the spacing between letters is NOT inconsistent. \r\n\r\nSo, I would like
  to know what you think of Xerox Sans with its legibility and spacing. Thanks. (Sorry
  about this lengthy post)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJZ\r\n"

    or double story a?\r\n\u2013 Is spacing too tight and/or inconsitant?\r\n\r\nAm
    I right?\r\n\r\nWell the blur test seems to be very much in favour of the double
    story a, though I don't know if there are other tests for legibility (other typophiles
    probably know more. If this is used for the web (using font-embedding technology),
    I would have a look at the system fonts by [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/matthew+carter/fonts|Matthew
    Carter]], like Verdana and Tahoma. They have to be legible at small sizes and
    crude resolution, and they all seem to have a double-story a. This seems to indicate
    it is more legible. Several fonts by Spiekermann, like Meta, Officina, Info have
    been used a lot in signage, where legibility is a crucial factor as well. These
    also all have a double-story a. So I guess this is the better way to go in terms
    of legibility.\r\n\r\nAs for spacing, I do think it looks pretty tightly spaced,
    a bit choked up. Giving it more space to breathe would surely benifit legibility.
    But other experts probably fill you in on specific details.  \r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

    ment for printing? I don't/wouldn't really wonder about any problems <em>(weight
    or spacing)</em> with on-screen showings. Adobe Reader is quite famous for not
    'getting' it right, on screen. (Sooo \u2014 If this is ment to be print out, you
    should check with how it looks printed and compare the spacing again.)"

  body: "@Queneau\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing your thoughts.:-) My words are sort of
    verbose. If I could desig my own typeface, I will favor the two-story \"a\" &
    \"g\" design. I want to point out that Xerox Sans is not a system font, like Georgia
    or Verdana. It's Xerox's corporate typeface which might show up on everything
    Xerox from corporate brochures to business cards (I tend to think so) except for
    the web. Aside pixelated Xerox Sans, Arial is still the web font at Xerox.com.\r\n\r\nI
    know Meta, Info and Officina use the more legible 2-story design of \"a\" & \"g\".
    Looks like there is a little difference between these Spiekersans and Xerox Sans.
    As I said before, Xerox Sans' legibility is OK for me, but it won't be legible
    at extreme point size. \r\n\r\nI don't know if the blurring test is one of measurment
    metrics for a typeface's legibility. Any info will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n@David\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your input. :-) I will give it a try later.\r\n\r\n\r\nJZ"

  body: "I think I have to agree that a double-story a and g are preferred when it
    comes to legibility. Basicallly, the more differentiation there is between letters,
    the better it reads. A one-story a could obviously be confused with an o. Although
    in practise you'll notice that you can perfectly read the texts set in Xerox Sans.
    But when you're talking about <em>immersive</em> reading (which happens almost
    subconsiously) I think it could be detrimental.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in
    what happens when we read and how this ties in with typefaces, read Gerard Unger's
    book 'While you're reading'. He goes into these kind of aspects as well."

  body: "Keep in mind that while type designers love to ponce on about the finer details
    of spacing and legibility they aren\u2019t always so important. Sure this stuff
    is a big deal for a face like Clearview HWY that\u2019s not set by typographers
    and is read from a distance while moving. But Xerox Sans is being read by people
    sitting down with a bright light and all the time they need to spot each word.
    Maybe readers will need an extra tenth of a second here or there to recognize
    a three-syllable word that contains a and o, but otherwise that single-story a
    is irrelevant. And I really doubt anyone is reading corporate documents under
    conditions that resemble a gaussian blur, no matter how convenient it is to whip
    one up and pretend it proves a point."

  body: Is a double-storey g really clearly more preferable in a sans-serif design?
    A single-storey g wouldn't really be confused with any other letter, and there
    are several established designs (including most grotesques) that combine a double-storey
    a with a single-storey g. Personally, I find the double-storey g more classic-looking,
    but it does add unwelcome clutter in small sizes. There are arguments for and
    against both forms of g in sans-serif designs, but I wouldn't say one clearly
    wins out over the other in terms of readability.

  body: "Thanks for you guys' feedback. \r\n\r\n@JP\r\n\r\nI agreed with you. Xerox
    Sans is merely a customized typeface for a corporation, which is slightly different
    from the mainstream commercial typefaces. So it doesn't need to go through a gaussian
    blur in the designing process. It's understandable that my friend split Xerox
    Sans's hair and insist saying the failed blur test undermines Xerox Sans' legbility
    because type deisgn runs through his blood. Blur test is one of knee-jerk reactions
    when he spot a new typeface.:-)\r\n\r\n@Jongseong\r\n\r\nI also know some typefaces
    take one-story \"g\" along with two-story \"a\". And there are also other typefaces
    which use two-story design \"a\" and \"g\", say E-Types Press Sans. I think a
    two-story \"g\" probably add some readability noise in text. With your reminder,
    I'd better reconsider the design of \"g\" for myself.\r\n\r\n@Nick\r\n\r\nThe
    little charming tail does the job in the way the same tail in Truvia's logo, shown
    below:-) (I don't know what typeface it is.):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Truvia_Logo_Sm_3654.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    blurred Futura looks \"nice\".\r\n\r\n@John\r\n\r\nFor me, a blur test is irrelevant
    to one typeface's legibility and readability. I think my friend did the \"blur
    test\" only to butress his own opinion that ALL classic, popular and successful
    (sans serif) typefaces stick with the one-story design of \"a\". He's a little
    typographically draconian.\r\n\r\n@Jackson\r\n\r\nJP said exactly what I wanted
    to say in response to your question.\r\n\r\n@Eliason\r\n\r\nThanks for your picture,
