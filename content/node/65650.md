body: "The italic character set is a requirement for the description of a typeface
  (exception: mechanically obliqued fonts). Therefore, it was a pleasure for me to
  see that the German edition of the American \"Adobe Type Library Reference Book\"
  contains the italic character sets of the fonts. This means that the Adobe editors
  know that the italic character set is a requirement for the description of a typeface.\r\n\r\nThe
  editors of the \"FontBook\" (J\xFCrgen Siebert, Erik Spiekermann and others) do
  not know that the italic character set is a requirement for the description of a
  typeface. Therefore, the editors of the FontBook did not include italic character
  sets into the FontBook.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you want to see the italic \"J\"
  of Plantin, you may look into the \"Adobe Type Library Reference Book\", but you
  cannot consult the \"FontBook\", since J\xFCrgen Siebert and Erik Spiekermann think
  that it is not necessary to include italic character sets into the FontBook.\r\n"
