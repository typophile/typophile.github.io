  body: "Dav, I was about to disagree about Avant Garde, thinking that the 'k' is
    not the right shape. The samples I was looking at were heavier weights and the
    arms of the 'k' meet at the stem, but then I looked at the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-avant-garde-gothic/extra-light/testdrive.html?s=Patrick+Norguet&p=60\"
    target=\"new\">lightest weight of Avant Garde Gothic</a> and there was the right
    'k'. \r\n\r\nGood call. Sorry for doubting you ;-)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
