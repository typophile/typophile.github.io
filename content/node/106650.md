    body: Although it seems to be a perfect match, there are quite some differences.
      Some letter have square serifs (like r and n) , other are sharp (like A, r,
      u and d). I also think this could be a custom font, a modified version of Farnham
      or other font family. However, many thanks for the help. Much appreciated. Still
      looking, searching...

  body: Totally right. I hadn't notice these details but thought it was too close
    not to be Farnham. May be slightly edited... What's the sample origin? Could make
    the search a bit easier...
