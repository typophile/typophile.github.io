  like your opinion on this logo that I am working on for a restaurant in Los Angeles.
  Please feel free to tear it apart and let me know what I can do to improve upon
  it. Thank you all very much!\r\n\r\nAce"

  body: This is a lot of fun. However, the R seems out of place. It feels a little
    pushed into the spot. This is a unicase design but you've used a cap R in that
    way. It really is the only thing I might suggest revisiting and changing back
    to a lowercase r.

  body: "I have to disagree with Tiffany on that, I think the R gives the logotype
    a little more character. However, I think the leg could be moved out a little
    further and the swoosh extended a bit. \r\n\r\nThe curve of the C seems a little
    stiff and is it shorter than the d? \r\n\r\nAlso the a's strokes are too thick
    and looks larger than the other letters (both taller and wider), especially on
    the back stroke. Plus that weird wedge... I'd maybe mimic the stroke of the n
    and even the R more.\r\n\r\nI don't know, but I want to see some of those strokes
    end in a point, even if it's just a the swoosh of the R. They way the end abruptly
    seems a little strange. \r\n\r\nYou also might want to vary the extra strokes
    along the right side of the R and n, even if it's just moving one down so that
    they're not exactly the same. Same with the connecting strokes of the first 2
    o's.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is very well done. I will agree with Tiffany, it
    is fun. "

  body: "I like it. (Where's the restaurant located? I'm in LA myself.)\r\n\r\nThe
    one thing that might make it a bit less busy and more focused is taming the two
    \"loop-backs\" at the bottom-lefts of the \"r\" and \"n\", by making them not
    fully reconnect to their stems; and maybe disjoin the \"C\" from the rest. And
    while you're at it you might disjoin the bowl & leg from the stem in the \"r\"
    (like you had in the original thread); for one thing that would reduce the possible
    confusion with a \"p\".\r\n\r\n> I think the leg could be moved out a little\r\n>
    further and the swoosh extended a bit.\r\n\r\nI know this will sound cheesy (and
    done too explicitly it will most certainly be totally cloying) but I'm seeing
    the potential for hinting at a smiling face in there: the \"ona\" is the eyes
    and nose, and the swoosh of course is the mouth. But \"hinting\" is the operative
    word - it should barely be noticeable, something that somebody might eventually
    point out to a friend, yielding an \"Aha!\" moment. The desirability of this sort
    of thing does depend on the intended clientele however.\r\n\r\nOne other thing:
    some of the curves are malformed (like the left side of the \"C\", and the bottom
    of the \"s\"). Now, this being a -presumably somewhat populist- Mexican joint,
    the so-called \"vernacular\" flavor of such wobbles might be a welcome touch of
    character. But if not, you might want to pay extra attention to the curve quality.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    does not open for a couple of weeks so there is time to finesse and I will post
    more progress soon. \r\n\r\nhrant: I sent you an email a while back\u2014did you
    get it? Basically I was asking for info on type design classes at the art center
    since I could not find it on the Art Center at Night website any longer. \r\n\r\nAce"

  body: Although I like overall the logo, i find that the R looks like a lower case
    k with the loop and that could be confusing the first time you'll read the name.
