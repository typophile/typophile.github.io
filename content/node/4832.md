  It was a symbol people used <BR>as a protection against evil. By using it in  <BR>jewellery
  or as a symbol carved or drawn on  <BR>buildings it protected not only people but  <BR>cattle,
  homes etc. <BR> <BR>Hannun Vaakuna might have come to Finland from  <BR>Germany,
  that&#39;s not 100% sure but very likely.  <BR>You may find Hannun vaakuna

  body: I think the old reversed swastika symbol of the Finnish Air Force was developed
    from Hannu&#39;s vaakuna. <BR>The Nazis took up the swastika symbol after a certain
    man with moustache spent some time in Viennese libraries studying occult literature.

  body: Terve Aku Ankkuli,  <BR>I got to know that Hannun vaakuna and Hakaristi are
    the very old finnish symbols  <BR>but these are also used in different asian cultures;  <BR>in
    India Hannun vaakuna is an original figure of four &#40;4&#41;.  <BR>Yes, I discovered
    about the history of the swastika reading Frutiger&#39;s &#34;Signs &amp; Symbols&#34;  <BR>&#40;Der
    Mensch und seine Zeichen&#41;.

  body: 'Is this a continuation of another thread? I see two symbols on that button
    or whatever it is, the labyrinth &#39;swastica&#39; and something behind it. The
    symbol at the back I saw hundreds of times in Iceland a couple of years back,
    the first time &#40;that&#39;s what got my attention&#41; tattoeed on a girls
    wrist, I researched it, but I&#39;ve lost the data, It has eight &#39;arms&#39;
    of which you only see four on the button and it&#39;s meant to ward of &#39;abuse
    of power&#39;. it&#39;s a classic in Iceland. on labyrinths: In viking mythology,
    labyrinths are a cool piece of work because evil spirits are kind of dumb and
    can&#39;t find their way out of a labyrinth, sort of like the same idea with those
    Japanese gardens with running water and everything. On a personal note, I also
    think that the labyrinth was a metaphor for life, getting through it without getting
    lost and that. <BR>I don&#39;t think the pattern has any relation to the swastika.
    <BR>Sorry if I&#39;m budding in on something. <BR>'

  body: Very interesting text Mr. Kenn Munk, thanks. <BR>This is a continuation of
    a personal thread I had with an art historian. <BR>Attached is LABYRINTHI, from
    around 1750. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/36707.gif"

    life, getting through it without getting lost and that.</i> <BR> <BR>There are
    two kinds of labyrinth: the classic maze in which one can get lost and the form
    often found on the floor in mediaeval cathedrals. The purpose of the latter is
    clearly symbolic or metaphorical: the design looks complex and like something
    in which one might get lost, but in fact there is only a single path through all
    the twists and turns, arriving at a single destination, the centre, symbolising
    the path of the soul through the distractions of life to rest in Christ. <BR>
    <BR>By the way, there is no evidence that people walked these labyrinths in the
    Middle Ages: their role was symbolic and decorative. You didn&#39;t need to walk
    the labyrinth in order to understand what it meant: you just had to look at it.'

  body: 'Thanks, Alessandro, it&#39;s an interesting thread. <BR>BTW. When I researched
    that Icelandic symbol, I also found a symbol that people carved in butter to keep
    it from going bad. <BR>John: I was speaking of the ones the vikings used, but
    I was probably a bit vague. You&#39;re right about the two kinds! that thought
    never occured to me. The viking ones were of the single-path kind so my labyritnh-as-life
    theory doesn&#39;t really hold up. I&#39;m not a 100%, but I read somewhere that
    people &#39;danced the labyrinth&#39;. &#40;Again: the vikings, slightly pre-medieval
    times. &#40;In Scandnavian terms.&#41;&#41; These labyrinths were also circular
    and the dancers started in the middle. These dances could take quite a while.
    When they finally came out the real party began. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know when
    the earliest known labyrinths/mazes appeared?'

  body: When I looked at the image I saw a knot and four pre-Colombian-type figures.  <BR>As
    I remember Daedalus designed Minos&#39; Labyrinth on Crete based on floor plans
    in the Palace at Knossos. A true labyrinth, as opposed to a maze, does not have
    false trails, basically a long walk in 7 &#40;and later more&#41; decreasing circles.
    What tickles me most about labyrinths is the link between a ball of wool and a
    clue. <BR>This site is very interesting <a href="http://www.labyrinthos.net/f_homepage.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.labyrinthos.net/f_homepage.htm</a> it debunks some
    claims for early labyrinths <BR> <BR>I had a quick search and came up with some
    information on finnish swastikas - I double checked it as far as possible but
    I cannot say it is accurate.  <BR>The Finnish blue swastika was originally the
    symbol of luck of the family of Count von Rosen, who donated to the Finnish &#34;White
    Army&#34; it&#39;s first plane, in 1918, during the War of Independence.  <BR>
    <BR>It was adopted as the official national marking of the Finnish Air Forces
    and later on, the Army. Only after the Nazis adopted it as their emblem did it
    acquire political significance. In other words, the Finnish swastika had nothing
    to do with the Nazi party, Nazi ideology or fascism in general.  <BR> <BR>After
    the fall of the 3rd Reich, the Finnish Defense Forces abandoned the disreputable
    swastika in favor of the new national marking; the blue and white roundel. <BR>

  body: You probably all know this but the Swaatika was widely used in Europe before
    the Nazis adopted it, If you&#39;re in Copenhagen, go see the Carlsberg brewery
    with two giant stone elephants with huge swastikas on their flanks. Opposite the
    house I live in there&#39;s an early 1900s building decorated with all sorts of
    swastikas, It&#39;s sort of strange that these haven&#39;t been painted over.
    An annoying twist to this is that this building &#40;and my home&#41; is halfway
    between the city center and the stadium, so every other Sunday Neonazi soccerfans
    walk by, saluting these pre-3rd Reich swastikas.
