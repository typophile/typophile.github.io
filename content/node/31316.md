body: "Hey guys,\r\nI want to buy 4 weights of Meta but Fontfont licesing only allows
  me to use it for 5 users (basic licensing). The advanced licensing (25 users) is
  double the cost! Thats $300+. Is there any other place that sells Meta with a much
  better licensing without the added costs?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Prakash it might be worth calling Fontshop and speaking to a representative
    about your situation. How many seats do you need it for? If you do the math the
    per seat cost is still very affordable.

  body: Na its ok. I'd rather just buy the advanced since we might need more in the
    future. Thanks though.
