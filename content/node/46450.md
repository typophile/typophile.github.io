  Regular]]. <strong>Let me present Pilo Thin!</strong>\r\n\r\nThe mission of Pilo
  Thin was to create a typeface that was exactly the opposite of the very bold Pilo
  Regular. A thinner cousin, which would create the contrast and to be a credible
  member of the family. The challenge was to make the font build as much as possible
  on inner lines in Pilo Regular but that it would feel like it just picked them off.
  Pilo Thin is more feminine and some shapes has been softened up and adjusted so
  that Pilo Thin can stand on it\xB4s own, but without forgetting its origin.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.bold.se/dokument/Pilo_Thin_Specimen.pdf|See
