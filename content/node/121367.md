body: "Hi guys\r\n\r\nWhen printing on paper, I use points spec everything, such as
  my baseline grids, leading, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, now that I'm working on a signage
  project, the contractors require me to spec everything in millimetres \u2014 such
  as the cap height, margins and so on because it would not make sense for them to
  measure something that is \"4.1574931 mm\" or anything like that.\r\n\r\nDoes this
  mean I should use millimetres for everything now? Such as margins, leading, baselines
  grids? How will it affect the overall aesthetic? Would using millimetres for leading
  go against any typographic best practices?\r\n\r\nWould be great if anyone could
  share how they set up their canvas. Any insight would be great! \r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance!"

    millimetres: since I start with paper sizes expressed in mm (usually A4, 210\xD7297mm)
    I find much easier setting a grid (margin, columns, baseline, etc.), it greatly
    simplifies any calculation involved. The rest is eye ;)"

    assume so, but you should ask the signage contractors.\r\n\r\nNormally text in
    signage is much larger than in a printed document, so millimeters should work
    okay. Just design the signage as you wish and then convert the measurements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
