  in the web about the fonts mentioned in the subject?\r\nWhich default fonts are
  used, 99% guarantee, in all windows versions AND in all the mac os versions?\r\n\r\nI'm
  making editable pdf-files and it would be nice if they could be opened in every
  computer without changes in font (pc to mac).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    the fonts? Providing they are set to 'editable embedding' you're fine. Most Microsoft
    supplied fonts and Adobe Originals are set this way - other vendors will license
    you editable embedding fonts for a small additional fee. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"

  body: Wow, Macs get way better default typefaces. I mean, I'm not really surprised,
    except for how low things like Gill and Futura appear on the Windows list. Those
    seem like such standards.

    they also get a waaay better search function. On my new iMac, the little magnifying
    glass in the upper right corner, as best I can make out, searches filenames, subject
    headings, the contents of documents and e-mail, images, .pdf files, and gives
    you a definition from the dictionary with results in about the same time it would
    take to start a search in WIndows. This feature is kick-butt and I don't remember
    seeing anyone mention it. This has been pretty startling for me."

    not sure that\u2019s so true now that Vista is shipping all those great new designs.
    Of course it seems like most Vista users are just downgrading to XP, but still\u2026"
