  body: "hi, i have no idea what font is that, but it looks like the K and C capitals
    aren't the same font of the other letters. I think it's something redesigned for
    that logotype... if you see the S is almost as tall as the T, the T and the D
    are not in proportion... I don't know, but it looks like something has been modifyed.
    \r\nPS: i have an ipod case of KC and i see that the logo printed on the rubber
    band is different: less \"thin\", different kerning and different S. \r\nciao!"
