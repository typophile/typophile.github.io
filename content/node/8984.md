  body: It looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-meta/bold-roman/testdrive.html?s=ask+Fortunately&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Meta Bold</a> meets <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/triplex/sans-bold/testdrive.html?s=ask+Fortunately&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Triplex Sans</a>. The bent stems are Triplex--like, but too many
    other things are different. The legs on the &#39;k&#39; are unusual, and just
    like Triplex, but the e, t, r, y and others are not Triplex. <BR> <BR>How about
    seeing some more letters, especially G, g, M, and R?
