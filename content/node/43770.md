    pushy, but enquiring minds want to know... If you were in receipt of a scientific
    report on legibility and the only typographic reference cited was <em>The Thames
    Hudson Manual of Typography</em>, would that tell you anything?  I am not familiar
    with the book. "

  body: "Russell, I purchased this book back in the mid-90s, for my first book design
    project, and it was very helpful. Even though some of the information in the book
    might be considered outdated nowadays, the chapters on book design, the parts
    of a book, paper, lettering, calligraphy, and printing are all useful. And I,
    for one, think that even the \"outdated\" parts are still useful, the same way
    that I find it useful to know where terms like [[leading]] come from.\r\n\r\n[EDIT]
    P.S.: Bear in mind that the book's author, Ruari McLean, was British, so you'll
    encounter terms like \"jobbing\" throughout the text."

    of a long train of traditional practice. However, it does strike me that the observations
    about style of letter express the insular point of view of typographic tradition
    developed by the English after World War II. Valid opinions but not exclusively
