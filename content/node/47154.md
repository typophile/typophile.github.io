  is the masthead for a paper in Fort Worth, TX in 1882.\r\n\r\nNot having much experience
  identifying types, I looked around on the web, & the closest I could find was Cloister
  Black (though looking at Cloister Black in detail now, it seems there's way too
  many differences between it and this masthead type for the latter to be a mere modification
  of the former).  \r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: Most mastheads are custom designed. Might be the case with this one as well.

  body: "ah, that makes sense, thanks for the info.\r\n\r\nIs there a less specific
    way to describe a (possibly)custom type like this?  As in: \"This masthead uses
    a font from the Old English family\"?  I mean, is that a legitimate way to talk
    about types/fonts, or am I just making this up from google searches?"

  body: "This strikes me as odd and potentially misleading phrasing. Will your reader
    understand that your example blackletter types postdate the nameplate, and thus
    could not themselves have \"informed\" the design of it? \r\n\r\nAnd, using the
    word \"customized font\" implies that a whole alphabet of individual type sorts
    was made for the newspaper, when (as I understand it) if it was indeed a custom
    nameplate, it would have been a single piece and thus not properly called a \"font\"
    (and probably not properly called \"type\")."

    is an appropriate usage here.\r\n\r\neliason: I appreciate the critique.  yeah,
    I considered the post-dated nature of blackletter types, and on second thought
    I think I'll ditch the \"informed\" bit.  you bring up an interesting point about
    these letters not constituting a font, but if they're not of a \"font\" or of
    a \"type\", then what are they? (sorry if I'm asking questions an intro text on
    graphic design would just as easily answer).\r\n\r\nFlorian & everyone else: how
    about: \"The paper's nameplate employs handtooled Gothic typefaces in an otherwise
    distinguished, uncluttered front-page banner.\""

    final sentence is fine, but maybe mention that it was the look almost universal
    to newspapers then rather than something particularly unique to this one."
