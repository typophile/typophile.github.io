  zoomed in and altered image, but a serif font that is tall, with a fairly low x-height.
  Any thoughts?"

    quality, non-distorted image of this type, I couldn't find a hit on Whatfontis
    or Whatthefont.\r\n\r\nThe x height, the long, ramrod straight serifs on the T,
    and the unidirectional serifs on the n and u are very distinctive. This may have
    been a custom-engraved piece of type that Crane's has been using for a very long
    time...."

    http://www.fontscape.com/explore?OCV \r\nNo matches but compressing fonts like
    Sackers Antique Roman might give you something to think about. \r\nHere is Sackers
    Antique Roman with width compressed to 40% [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SackersAntiqueRomanInUseWidth40pct_4598.jpg]\r\nHere
    is Sackers Antique Roman Open also with width compressed to 40% \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SackersAntiqueRomanOpenInUse_6535.jpg]\r\nCloser
    to your _Thank you_ if you ignore the inline effect.\r\nDon"
