body: "When creating a type family I start with the 2 extreme weights - Thin and Extra
  Bold.\r\n\r\nI then carefully space and kern these 2 weights keeping them consistent.
  Once I am happy with the 2 weights I blend percentages between them - for example
  20%, 40%, 60% and 80% to create a six weight family. Doing it this way ensures correct
  spacing and kerning throughout the family. I don't use the same kerning for both
  weights. \r\n\r\nThis worked fine in Fontographer.\r\n\r\nI tried this in Fontlab
  - it was OK blending some of the characters, but others could not be blended even
  though the outlines (or contours) are totally compatible with similar numbers and
  types of points (or nodes), path directions and starting points. In the resulting
  font extra nodes were inserted even when the 'Do not interpolate compatible outlines'
  box is checked. This apparently shouldn't be the case.\r\n\r\nAlso - and this is
  very bad - there is no kerning in the blended font. Where is the kerning? it also
  should be a percentage blend between the kerning of the Thin and Extra Bold originals.\r\n\r\nAny
  advice?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: A better way to do it is to set up your two extremes as a one-axis multiple
    master font, and then generate instances (between 0 and 1000) to get the final
    fonts. Kerning is correctly blended when you do it this way.

  body: "Thanks for that Mark. I tried it using the 'Tools' - blend fonts - Build
    the Multiple Master - axis: weight, then 'tools - Multiple Master - generate instance
    - with the 2 extremes open. The resulting 20% 'Light' blend weight, (200 between
    0 and 1000) was correct, but the kerning was all over the place. Is anything ever
    straightforward in this ***** program?\r\n\r\nTake the TA characters: Kerning
    for Thin is -77, Kerning for Extra Bold is -62\r\n\r\nIt should be -74 in the
    new 'Light'  weight but instead it's +32, those were the first characters I looked
    at, so how can I trust it to do any pairs correctly?\r\n\r\nAnd what of the characters
    that refuse to blend properly? Do you have to replace them manually from an Illustrator/Freehand
    4 step blend?\r\n\r\nSorry to bother you with this, but trying to get the info
    from the manual I may as well be reading Russian for all the sense it makes.\r\n\r\nNick

  body: "I wouldn't trust interpolated kerning pairs, just me though.\r\nBetter, you
    might want to give the Transform>Metrics>Adjust Metrics a try.\r\nI usually dump
    kerning from another weight into a new weight\r\nand adjust in relation to the
    change in spacing metrics.\r\nOf course, you'll want to proof the results of this
    as well.\r\n\r\nAs for just a straight inerpolation, why not use FOG for interps\r\nif
    you don't like the results in FL? I've been preparing a font\r\nwith round tips
    recently and I've found the FL interps with this data\r\nto be garbage. So back
    to FOG for some stuff."

  body: "Normally I would use Fontographer for interpolating as it interpolates everything
    correctly - characters, sidebearings and kerning.\r\n\r\nWhy doesn't Fontlab perform
    the kerning interpolation procedure correctly?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, (as far as
    kerning goes) I am producing a Cyrillic version of my Chevin family for a client
    and opening the fonts in Fog doesn't work as all Russian characters are undefined.\r\n\r\nI
    think I'll have to give your Transform>Metrics>Adjust Metrics a try. It's not
    ideal but it might be the solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
