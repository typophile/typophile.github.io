body: "Hi all, long time reader, first time post.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I thought the sharp
  eyes at Typophile would be able to point me in the right direction with a design
  I'm working on, as I am rather stuck. \r\n\r\nMy sister basically asked me to design
  a wedding invitation, so I've been working on trying to develop a nice style on
  the cover, to essentially set the style (at least most of it) for the rest of the
  piece.\r\n\r\nThe couple are not interested in a classical approach, so I didn't
  feel formal script or a typical color palette was the greatest path to explore.\r\n\r\nMy
  initial attempt was to provide a relatively modern approach to the logo design and
  typeface choices. Contemporary and warm.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.furdiemenschen.com/downloads/typophile/wedding.gif\">Sample
  Cover</a>\r\n\r\nAs a designer who is stuck in the early stages, all feedback is
  welcome."

    easily, but Tina is a litlle hiden,don't you think? I think you could reequilibrate
    the logo\r\n\r\nwww.tonicastro.com"

    body: "Indeed, that's something I was having trouble resolving. I think one of
      the problems is the inherent size difference between lowercase t and d. \r\n\r\nThat
      said, I'll definitely give it another whirl."

  body: "Thanks for comments everyone. I've tried completely retooling the logo. At
    first, I tried adding different types of ascenders and varying crossbars on top
    of the letter d from a variety of modern typefaces (the previous example was Bodoni),
    but nothing really looked natural.\r\n\r\nI tried taking script fonts, and melding
    the two together. Here is the first attempt.\r\n\r\nThe other two images are attempts
    at using script fonts for the initials (as opposed to a customized logo), as the
    t and d seem to fit well together.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.furdiemenschen.com/downloads/typophile/wedding_logo01.gif\">1st
    Iteration</a> \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.furdiemenschen.com/downloads/typophile/wedding_logo02.gif\">2nd
    Iteration</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.furdiemenschen.com/downloads/typophile/wedding_logo03.gif\">3rd
    Iteration</a>\r\n\r\nI must say, it's getting a bit frustrating!\r\n"
