    a nice slab that I know though I can''t remember which it is. '

  body: "Thanks. The copy of Skolar I have (used in Windows with MS Word printing
    to Acrobat Pro 10) looks so much darker. Perhaps too dark.  Any idea how they
    get it to nice and light (or what's wrong with my computer?).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "On Windows fonts are differently displayed depending how well they are \u201Cprepared\u201D
    for the screen (=hinting), on a Mac hinting does not make a difference. \r\n\r\nWhen
    printed the type of print technology defines how dark a typeface will look. Offset
    for example looks light. "
