body: "I'm wondering how many custom typefaces have been made for colleges and universities.
  I'm quite familiar with the <a href=http://www.yale.edu/universityprinter/typeface/>Yale
  typeface</a>, and a search refreshed my memory of <a href=http://klim.co.nz/custom_vic.php>Victoria
  Sans and Serif</a>, <a href=http://p22.com/lanston/californian.html>Californian</a>,
  and <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/36930>Beauchef</a>. Are there any others
  originally designed for a university's identity program? Thanks.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh,
  and <a href=http://stonetypefoundry.com/basaltoverview.html>Basalt</a> could fit
  here, too, although it seems to be for Stanford's library, not for the whole university."

    a whole, or just for/by the University Press?

  body: I think you're right, Craig. If I remember <em>Typologia</em> correctly, Californian
    was made for the press. So make that three examples of custom university type
    :-)

  body: "Thanks a lot, Marc. A bit of Google digging shows that the University commissioned
    HouseStyle Graphics to digitize a Modern and a Grotesque from Stephenson Blake.
    For others' perusal, more info <a href=http://www.shef.ac.uk/mediacentre/2005/509.html>here</a>,
    PDF showing Stephenson and Blake in action <a href=http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/content/1/c6/03/13/21/Letter_layout.pdf>here</a>.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    After Sheffield's fonts got me in a British Industrial Revolution state of mind,
    I went looking for <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/BureauGrot/more/3>Bureau
    Grot</a>, which it turns out is based on Grotesque No. 8 and No. 9. Since Blake
    is based on Grotesque No. 6, we just need someone to digitize No. 7 and we'll
    have a complete set! ;-)"

  body: Thanks, John. I hadn't heard of Scripps before; sounds like the College no
    longer really uses it, which is too bad.

    uses Goudy's Scripps College Old Style in metal. See this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scrippscollege.edu/campus/press/index.php\r\n\r\n&
    it is available as a digital font from fonts.com\r\n\r\nIt sure is a Goudy face,
    ain't it? It'd be interesting to compare it with Goudy's University of California
    Old Style. A task for which I have not the time. Too bad.\r\n\r\npowers"
