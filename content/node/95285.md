  Here's a couple pictures:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/champion1_3769.png]\r\nI
  couldn't find anything bigger, so here it is stretched out:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/champion2_3932.png]\r\n\r\nI
  know most logos would be custom designed, but this seems like something that must
  have a font that's close to it. "
