  to generate a font with the open contours.\r\nFontLab closes the contours when generating
  the font (in any format)... \r\n\r\nthis is possible from FontLab?\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nEduardo Manso [ www.emtype.net ]"

  body: "A common application of such fonts is for stroke based font formats, still
    popular for EA languages where file size savings are important. \r\n\r\nIn addition
    such formats were used in the old days for pen plotter printing devices. Similar
    technology is used today in engraving and lazer etching devices. \r\n\r\nAnother
    obsolete use of this type of font was in coin-op arcade games such as Asteroids
    (the first game to use Atari's \"Quadra-Scan\" vector-refresh technology) and
    Tempest. \r\n\r\nAssuming you're producing some outlines for this type of work
    you might want to ask the people you're working for which tools they'd recommend."

  body: "Hi Sii,\r\n\r\nYes, is \"this type of work\".\r\nMacromedia Fontographer
    4 will generate fonts with open contours but I work in Mac-intel and OS9 and/or
    Macromedia Fontographer does not work, and I preferred to work in FontLab :)\r\nI
    believe that it is not possible...\r\n\r\nthanks for your answer,\r\n\r\nEduardo."
