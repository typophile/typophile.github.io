body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to put together a nice presentation template for my new
  department at work. Unfortunately, I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to
  my talks, and so I'm not happy to putting a pixelated PNG in my talk as the department
  logo.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the person who put this image together is no longer
  working here, I'm told, so noone knows what font was used. I'm trying to recreate
  this logo in high quality.\r\n\r\nI'd like to request an ID on this font, and ideally,
  a free font that is as close to this one as possible, such that I may recreate it.\r\n\r\nI
  think I've IDed the font as Scylla, although confirmation would be fantastic. It's
  not free, so I can't try it. I've attached the logo, and look forward to your opinions
  and suggstions.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nQuentin"

    look, without replicating the exact details in the image I'd like to duplicate.
    You should see the department's official logo..."

  body: If you are looking for free and something close you might consider Arial.
    Just about every Windows install has it. As we say in the sign business, no one
    will know the difference from the cheap seats. ;)

  body: Hmmm, Arial is fairly close, but somehow not as elegant.
