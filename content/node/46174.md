  years.\r\nAlthough many dismiss it as trendy and unprofessional, the hand lettering
  does have its own unique character.\r\nBe it the rough edges, uneven width of the
  strokes or even a slight variety of x-height between characters, but there is something
  about it that I personally find very appealing. \r\n\r\nI am looking to examine
  some fonts that have been inspired by the hand lettering and was hoping you could
  provide me with some links and also express your views on the subject. I am not
  looking for script fonts, or fonts inspired by peoples hand-writing, but rather
  fonts inspired by signage etc.\r\n\r\nyour input is appreciated as always!"

    was inspired by Chilean sign painting. If that's the sort of stuff you're looking
    for then there are many more.\r\n\r\n"

    is the latest flash in the pan, to 2008 what concentric circles, swashes, and
    Prussian/Russian crests were to 2006. Case in point: the credits for the movie
    Juno, where they accompanied painfully over-the-top dialogue by teenagers in thrift-store
    retro outfits and a girl-with-a-guitar soundtrack. Case in point number two: Flight
    of the Conchords, the comedians who expertly mocks the straight-out-of-Williamsburg
    motifs that infest Juno, use this style of lettering to make it very clear who
    they\u2019re mocking. When the comedians catch a trend as quickly as it comes
    on the scene, that\u2019s a sign the trend is in for a short lifespan.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I\u2019m interested in is what will follow: a reactionary swing to crisp modernism
    or techno 1990s retro? Or will the designers move on to hand-lettered work with
    a more finished look, like sho-cards or painted Russian propaganda posters?"

  body: "wow, thanks everyone!\r\ntheres plenty of tasty links for me to look at.\r\n\r\nhere's
    another quick question, i am going to design a family of hand-rendered fonts and
    am just wonderring whether its possible to have a font with about 4 or so variatons
    of every letter that would be mixed together when set in inDesign/quark or any
    other publishing soft. \r\n\r\nwhat i mean is, from many hand-rendered fonts i've
    seen, a lot of them look too digital.\r\nif i were to set a line of type in any
    of them, all characters 'a' would be the same.\r\n\r\ni want to create a typeface
    that would allow for variations of every character."
