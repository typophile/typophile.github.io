  I've tried several online file converters that claimed to support bdf but none of
  them actually worked.\r\nMany thanks in advance."

    format. What those converters probably mean is that they <em>embed</em> a BDF
    into a TT file (something I once did, when making Arasan). But many systems simply
    ignore those these days...\r\n\r\nNow, if your objective is to \"reproduce\" a
    bitmap font via outlines* I have some custom software that does that, but I haven't
    fired it up in years... Feel free to email me: hpapazian thatsymbol gmail dot

  body: Thanks for clearing that up. Most converters gave me some error though. I
    indeed want to reproduce a bitmap font through square-y outlines, like all the
    so-called "pixel" fonts out there that are actually ttf/otf. You've got mail ;)
