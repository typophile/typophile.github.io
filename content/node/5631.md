body: I have read that OS X can use Windows TT fonts, but I want to know whether they
  work seamlessly or whether there are downsides.  <BR> <BR>If they work fine, I&#39;d
  of course want to buy Win TT whenever possible so I can use it on my Mac and my
  PC. But if there are problems I&#39;ll just stick with the Mac versions. Does anyone
  regularly buy Windows fonts for their Mac? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>za

  body: I do. They mostly work fine, but their international behavior is a bit unpredictable
    - most have many Unicode pages, and the default language for each seems different.
    But all languges encoded in the TTF/OTF file ARE supported &#40;and English too,
    of course&#41; - if you use a Windows font in, say, Safari - they will work for
    any language.
