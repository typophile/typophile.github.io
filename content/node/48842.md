body: "The FLAB manual isn\u2019t up-to-date regarding <em>Preferences > Generating
  Opentype & Trueype > Kerning</em>, so I have a few more kerning classes questions.\r\n\r\nFirst,
  should I use the <em>\u201CExpand class kerning while building the [kern] table
  feature</em>? I worry that there might be important programs that don\u2019t support
  [kern] and that expanding the pairs will keep the font working in said programs.\r\n\r\nSecond,
  is the <em>Generate OpenType \u201Ckern\u201D feature if it is undefined or outdated</em>
  box there so that I don\u2019t have to manually update [kern] every time I change
  my kerns, or do I still need to do that manually?"

  body: "The problem with expanding class kerning is that in a font with lots of language
    support, you will get massive kern tables of tens of thousands of kern pairs,
    many of which don't occur in any language.\r\n\r\nI'm presently tackling the problem
    by having only a very limited number of kerning classes and kerns in non-OT fonts.
    \r\n\r\nI would not activate \"Generate...feature if it is...outdated.\" The reason
    is that you may at some point inadvertently lose your kerns, for instance if you
    have removed the basic kern table from an OT font before generating."

    or outdated option always on. By doing this I dont have to manually push the little
    button \"Generate Kern feature\" before everytime I generate a font. Has been
    working for me everytime. I only do OT-fonts."
