body: I'm trying to dig up a PDF speciman for FF Info. No luck so far. I cant find
  an address for Eric S. Would anyone have such a thing, or could you point me to
  it? Showing a client 12 point gifs from a website doesnt quite cut it. ;)

    working hard to get PDF specimens up on both fontfont.com and fontshop.com. You
    should see them very soon.\r\n\r\nShoot me some text and I'll PDF it for you."
