<p>They do interiors, and the logo is a bit to modern and cutting edge for most of their work, but they are at a point where they start getting more young designers working for them, and if the designers can´t be in front who is supposed to be? I just have to mention that the other direction for this logo is a straight Aksidenz Grotesk Black or, only typo(nothing to show you at this point).</p>
<p>They do mostly restaurants and cafés. You can have a look at their old [[http://www.rissdesign.no|website]], which I´m going to redesign, and that´s the reason for changing the logo. They are not quite satisfied with their old logo and the website is not updated since 2004 or something, have a look for yourselves.</p>
<p>The form is meant to be new and unconventional. Clean cut and out of the box at the same time.</p>
<p>I can see that the thin lines in negative may cause problems on some surfaces and should be tested, but newspaper print will never be an issue I guess. It will always be printed in 100%, so no room for raggedy lines caused by raster points.</p>
<p>@Ratbaggy: Sorry, but I don´t quite see the messy part, and if you look at modern architecture you will see lots of structures that are a lot more unconventional and still are great structures. Check out these norwegians for instance: <a href="http://www.snoarc.no/#/main/">http://www.snoarc.no/#/main/</a> or a google search for [[http://images.google.no/images?q=contemporary+architecture&amp;hl=no&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=4fq&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=images&amp;ct=title | contemporary architecture]]</p>
<p>Heres a couple of sketches for the website:

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The conflict for me is when I think modern/contemporary architecture, I think clean lines and plenty of right angles. So there&rsquo;s some dissonance with this particular shape in the logo&hellip;especially on your second mock-up of their web site&hellip;everythign is in right angles except the logo. What if you gave it at least one right angle, and maybe reduced the number of sides? Make it a box, with one angle pulled out into space like you have it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the shape in the lower left, either. Seems a bit arbitrary and maybe unecessary.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I would agree with aluminium on the matter of the shape in the lower left - it does seem to be somewhat of an afterthought with no real purpose.</p>
<p>However, I really agree with the direction you&rsquo;re trying to take. Judging by the old website and the photos on there, their interiors in their portfolio are modern enough. They don&rsquo;t appear massively cutting edge or ultra modern, but look like good examples of commercial interior design. If, like you say, there are more and more young designers joining then your logo may help to nudge the business in the right direction.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>IMO the irregular shape says <em>contemporary</em> architecture pretty well. Reminds me of the recent addition to the [[http://www.view.captureweb.co.uk/images/trueimages/H&amp;/DM/-W/AC/-0/02/9-/H&amp;DM-WAC-0029-A-2.jpg|Walker Arts Center]] in Minneapolis. We&rsquo;re a ways now from International Style boxes equalling architecture. I do get &ldquo;clean cut and out of the box at the same time&rdquo; from this.</p>
<p>I also would say I do see a purpose in the lower left shape - I see it as an abstract screen or something set up within the room created by the larger shape. It both makes the big shape easier to read as an architectural plan, and calls attention to the interior look as the focus. I&rsquo;m not saying it shouldn&rsquo;t be altered, but I wouldn&rsquo;t omit it.</p>

<p>I agree with hola&rsquo;s comment about the odd angle in the lower left. It&rsquo;s a bit of clutter that should be amputated (although maybe I&rsquo;m just an International Style purist in hiding).</p>
<p>As for the larger shape&hellip; I think I&rsquo;m ok with an abstract shape, but it has to be a sexy shape. It has to have rhythm, proportion, scale, and all those other things that make an object look like more than just an object. You know&hellip; FORM. The current shape isn&rsquo;t cutting it.</p>
<p>The brutal angularity of the shape also sets up a conflict with the light and airy typeface you&rsquo;ve chosen. Whether you want that conflict or not is up to you. But considering that this is interior architecture, I would suspect that you want to smooth out conflict as much as possible. People typically don&rsquo;t want conflict in their interior spaces, whether the exterior of the structure looks like a Daniel Libeskind product or not.</p>
<p>Why not just use RISS with the small (interior) angle, and get rid of the bigger angle shape? If the logo is about communicating an idea about space, it might help to break out of the box (whether the box is an abstract hexagon or a rectangle) and &ldquo;unbound&rdquo; the logo in a field of whitespace. It will make things seem more open and less boxed in. Think about a room with a nice corner and open windows on the other sides, versus a wonky six-walled room that you could never fit your furniture in.</p>
<p>But then, yeah, it looks like you haven&rsquo;t done much work. At the end of the day, it takes a lot of work to make things simple. You could always show the client this current angular/boxed-in logo and say, &ldquo;look how I took my original concept and cleaned it up.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re architects, they&rsquo;ll love it.</p>
<p>FYI: whether they&rsquo;re architects or not, I highly suspect that they&rsquo;d appreciate being called &ldquo;clients&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;customers.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>hola, without sounding glib &hellip;architecture defines itself, in a pure sense - rhythmic relationships between one built element and the other. It is these relationships that define ones interpretation/interaction of/with their architecture.</p>
<p>Not the space.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common misconception (and mispractise) that architecture defines space and it is a real sad cop-out. There are so many buzz phrases using space too. My fav is - spacial flow.</p>
<p>If this logo were to be truely modern, it would strive to represent an asymmetrical relationship between it&rsquo;s parts. And in doing so would indicate growth &hellip;jaggies or otherwise ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>well, let&rsquo;s think of some of nature&rsquo;s most spectacular &lsquo;architectural&rsquo; structures for inspiration:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>seedlings growing into trees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flowers blooming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>beehives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mountains</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>or what about high orders of design in nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sunflower seeds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leaves</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>not saying you should depict these, but maybe looking at them will inspire another idea.  It&rsquo;s something I find amazing and awe inspiring to look up at a mountain and touch it, see how sheer the height is.  To know how small I am and even how small that mountain is in the cosmos and yet it&rsquo;s still towering over me, immovable.</p>
<p>I think for an architect, to achieve that same emotion or even to indicate that awe somehow visually through a logo would be the strongest and best message an architect could give.  Design and stability. symmetry. vast porportions. classical.</p>
<p>I mean, something funky and &lsquo;hip&rsquo; might be trendy, but I don&rsquo;t see security in it, or longevity as a logo.  I would look at greek architecture and see how they built everything beautifully and symmetrically.  They used neat little tricks like the golden section and there&rsquo;s somewhat of a love/hate relationship between designers and the golden section, but nobody claims it&rsquo;s downright ugly and horrible.</p>
<p>Employing simple tools like symmettry, classical type and the golden section, I think you could come up with a great logo that&rsquo;s sturdy, elegant and at-one-with-nature that would give it a transparent trust as soon as you saw it.</p>
