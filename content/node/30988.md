  body: "The script is a S\xFCtterlin-Script. I dont think that there is any digitalization
    of exactly that script. There are not much Suetterlin-Fonts because nobody can
    read it. The red word above Tiger for example means \"Der\" The letters are totally
    unrecognisable. It would be mere chance that exactly that script got digitalized.

  body: "The text means:\r\n\r\n\"Der Tiger - Mensch, sooo ein Schlitten.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    Tiger was a tank of the Wehrmacht.\r\n\"Schlitten\" is a slang word in Germany
    for a kind of \"great car\" or so.. Do you know these Puerto Rico cars bumping
    the streets up and down? This would a german call a \"heisser (hot) Schlitten\".\r\n\r\nSo
    you can translate it with \"What a hottie\" or so..\r\n\r\nSuetterlin is still
    available as a font in different versions:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4875.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
    reason:\r\nAny german who is investigating his family needs \"translations\" of
    original letters, written in Suetterlin. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGeorg\r\n"

    Koch\r\nGebr. Klingspor\r\n1929\r\nThe designer changed the types to improve the
    rolls of the tank, I guess. (is \"improve\" correct? Don't know yet..)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3588.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
    the S\xFCtterlin is\r\nKoch Kurrent from 1935\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\nThis is the
    tank \"Tiger\".\r\nUsed from 1943 in the tank battle of Kursk/Orel.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6098.gif]"

    the letterforms are complely different!

    based on Kabel, I\u2019ll henceforth write my correspondence in S\xFCtterlin.
    However, the lettering in \xABTiger\xBB reminds me of some commercial work by
    Kurt Schwitters. I\u2019ll have to browse my books.\r\nBy the way: The old \xABEsso\xBB-Slogan
    \xABPack den Tiger in den Tank\xBB gets another meaning considering this background

    to use the S\xFCtterlin like all the other blackletter-types. After the Worldwar
    2 S\xFCtterlin was only teached by a few schools but not as the basid handwriting
    till the 70s. Nowadays, no young German is able to read it. Also its not in use
    anymore."
