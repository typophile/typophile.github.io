body: Hi all, <BR>I&#39;m trying to find a dingbat font to draw a skyline of an arabic
  landscape. For example fonts like &#34;city scape&#34; by Scriptorium or &#34;font-o-ville
  by night&#34; by Font-o-ville are something like what I&#39;m searching for, but
  I need more desert, palm, camels...
