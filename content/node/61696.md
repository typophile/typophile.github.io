  body: "This is a tricky question. Volume One of B.S. Naik's <em>Typography of Devanagari</em>
    has a few pages of specimen of old metal Devanagari faces, but this is probably
    not what you are looking for. I am guessing that you want digital fonts. I am
    not aware of a published book that can help you. There are a few PDFs from University
    of Reading graduates that could help you out (including my own) but these aren't
    published anywhere yet.\r\n\r\nIndic font foundries have PDF catalogs that you
    can download. Here is one listing C-DAC's Devanagari typefaces \u2013 http://www.cdac.in/html/gist/down/type/Devanagari.pdf\r\n\r\n(More
    on this page\u2026 http://www.cdac.in/html/gist/down/typeface.asp)\r\n\r\nThen
    there is Modular Infotech. http://www.modular-infotech.com/downloads/fonts/Devratna.pdf\r\n\r\n(More
    on them here\u2026 http://www.modular-infotech.com/html/fonts.html)\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly,
    they haven't published any books yet, but I hope that they will \u2013 http://www.indiantypefoundry.com/site/index.php"
