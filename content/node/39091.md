  company paid for these logo some years ago, but we can't contact anymore the original
  designer and all we got are images... And now I need to create a new logo for a
  new product... \r\n\r\nI tried to search for myself, but the nearest one I found
  was fontfont's Meta Condensed, but there are still difference like the 't' tail
  which is not going up enough...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Stephen - From the images you provide, especially the large, the weaknesses
    you mention are clear and yet ... I find Quay Sans to be far superior between
    these two in clarity and readability.\r\n\r\nI'm basing this solely on your images
    - and weight certainly plays a role here - but still, isn't readability the point
    in this application?\r\n\r\nI'm curious how others see the relative readability
    of this font with some ugly quirks."

  body: Maybe the German text is skewing your perception? If I had a moment, I'd whip
    up a PDF for you to print. Quay Sans isn't unreadable, I just think it's ugly
    not nearly as successful a design.
