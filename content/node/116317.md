body: "Hi there\r\n\r\nI'm looking to add a simple alternate feature to a font. The
  font is purely uppercase but in the lowercase glyphs the font has one set of of
  alternates (also uppercase design). \r\n\r\nWe're not after any cutting edge attempts
  at randomisation, just a simple toggle effect, cycling through so every other time
  you type a letter the alternate displays. So typing \"aaaa\" will pull out \"aAaA\"
  from the glyphs.\r\n\r\nI have looked through a lot of posts and articles and have
  found much useful information, but can't quite pin down the exact code. I understand
  it's quite simple and I'm almost there I think. I have created two classes - class1
  (uppercase) and class2 (lowercase). \r\n\r\nNow I believe I just need a simple piece
  of code to place here in the opentype panel:\r\n\r\nfeature xxxx {\r\n  sub by ;\r\n}
  xxxx;\r\n\r\nI just can't find anything that has an example of the code, just the
  effect I'm after described in general terms. If anyone could help me out here,  I
  would be extremely grateful.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nPascal"

    because the regular expression to match [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#2.f.i|valid
    glyph names]] (in AFDKO syntax) is <code>(\\\\?[A-z_][A-z0-9_.]*|\\.notdef)</code>.
    Sorry for nitpicking."
