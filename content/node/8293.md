  to identify it. I&#39;ve tried Identifont with no luck, so any help would be appreciated.  <BR>
  <BR>The site is italian, I&#39;m hoping the font isn&#39;t only in Italy, though
  with the trouble I&#39;m having identifying it, it may be that, or custom made.
  <BR> <BR>here&#39;s a link to the site:  <BR><a href="http://www.comune.alba.cn.it/"

  a pic in this thread, they cut up the image into many pieces. <BR> <BR>Cheers!'
