  body: if the&#39;re tree rings definately make them more organic/less geometric.  A
    more organic graphic would harmonize well with the more geometic type.

  body: Steve, do me a favor get away from the computer, grab a pencil and paper and
    play around. The logo looks like something out of the 80s. Its cold and unaccessible.
    Try making it more organic as Paul suggests.
