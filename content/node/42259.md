  a font. I know pretty much nothing about how the whole process works, but would
  still like your critiques on where I'm at so far! Tell me what you think... any
  tips would be greatly appriciated.\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\nP.S. I know the \"S\" and
  \"Z\" need some work... they're still a bit choppy.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font2_3934.png]"

  body: 'Fun little starter project you have there. A few tips: Where the circle sections
    meet the straight section, you should make the connection softer. Secondly: It
    seems that you have simply outlined a stroked path in Illustrator to create the
    letterforms. In this case stretch the letterforms vertically up by 10-15% before
    you outline the stroke, and then scale back down after outlining. That way you
    adjust for the optical illusion that horizontals look beefier than verticals.
    And yes, the S and Z are atrocious.'

  body: "The Q <strong>is</strong> great.  I also like N, T, V, J, and the overall
    feel.  \r\n\r\nYou're right, the S and Z need work. Don't make the middle part
    of the S and Z go completely horizontal -- use a bigger radius on the inner part
    of the curves, and have them meet diagonally. \r\n\r\nI'd bring the middle of
    the Y, P and R down, and the middle of the B and K up.\r\n\r\nThe C, E, and F
    are too narrow.  Either widen them, or experiment with more variation in character
    widths across the entire alphabet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
