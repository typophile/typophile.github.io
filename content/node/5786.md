body: No jokes about a dead technology, please! I&#39;m wondering if there is anyone
  teaching Fontographer to newbies in the Twin Cities area. Some of my colleagues
  are interested in getting a head start by learning from an experienced Fontographer
  user.  <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    Olson</a> -- I know he teaches &#40;or taught&#41; type at MCAD. <BR> <BR>Also,
    check out the MCAD and U of MN extension catalogs.
