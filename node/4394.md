  body: The roman is <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205302"
    target="_blank">Monotype Garamond</a>, stretched horizontally a bit. A close match
    for the script would be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palace-script/"
    target="_blank">Palace Script</a>, but it doesn&#39;t have the extra stroke in
    the center. There is an old metal face by Bauer called Graphic Script which is
    also a close match, including the center stroke, but I don&#39;t know of a digital
    version.
