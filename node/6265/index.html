		<div class="commentbody">Darren, <BR> <BR>Welcome to the forum, and thanks for participating!  At risk of repeating Ricardo's critique, it appears that the face (at least at this magnification) has varying stroke weights within the letters. This creates dark spots in letters like the S. I will make this request, howver- can you set some words and/or phrases in the face? Sometimes it helps to see the overall color and rhythm of the face to effectively critique it. And oftimes, variation and nuance within the face itself can really bring the type to life.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Darren, <BR> <BR>This has the potential to be a great and highly versatile typeface. Ironically, it reminded me of Erik Spiekermann's faces (Officina, Meta), but I too can see the similarities with Hubert Jocham's faces now that the resemblances have been pointed out. <BR> <BR>I would echo all of the suggestions so far, and add a couple of my own: <BR> <BR>1. As Ricardo mentioned about the lc &quot;a&quot; being a bit condensed, you may want to look at all of the letters' widths in relation to one another. The proportions seem slightly off (lc &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; and uc &quot;V&quot; seem a bit wide, while lc &quot;a&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, uc &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;W&quot; seem narrow). <BR> <BR>2. You may want to try bringing the vertex of the lc &quot;y&quot; down closer to or slightly below the baseline. This may help balance the body with the tail, and also may help balance its width with the other characters. OR, as an alternative to this, try widening the angles of the two strokes just a bit. Or maybe a little of both. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>3. I agree that the lower case set seems lighter than the upper case and figures sets. I like the look of the weight of the upper case and figures, so I would suggest making the lower case slightly heavier. <BR> <BR>I really like the design of the lc &quot;a&quot;. And I find the differing terminal cuts on the uc &quot;K&quot; and lc &quot;k&quot; to be really interesting. It would be interesting to see you apply the same terminals to some other characters, such as uc &quot;R&quot;, uc &quot;X&quot; and lc &quot;x&quot;. <BR> <BR>I'm looking forward to seeing this face evolve. <BR> <BR>David</div>

Basically, I've imported the face into FontLab (the first image is taken from illustrator where I drew the letters initially), created a font file and then set the text. I haven't done any work on character spacing/kerning etc etc, it's just a very raw and basic setting.

		<div class="commentbody">I think your lc is looking great, except: <BR>1. The &quot;k&quot;'s upper arm is/seems too long. <BR>2. The &quot;m&quot;'s counters seem unequal. <BR>3. The &quot;w&quot; is too wide. I know it's tempting to make it two &quot;v&quot;s (I've done that myself), but it's better to make the strokes less inclined; you might also consider stopping the middle part before it reaches the x-height - it helps readability. <BR> <BR>For your UC, I like most of the forms individually, but I think you have an important -and equally challenging- decision to make: do you want all the caps to approximately converge in width (the &quot;contemporary&quot; approach), or do you want them to diverge (like in &quot;old style&quot; fonts)? The latter I myself prefer, even in designs like this, not least because it makes all-caps setting much less unreadable. Right now it seems your caps are somewhere in between the two approaches, and I think that's a problem. Also: there's still some color imbalance, although a GIF is a terrible place to judge that - you really have to go lino before you can be confident of the color (especially as mass text). <BR> <BR>Numerals: very nice, except for the joins of the &quot;6&quot; and &quot;9&quot; being tucked in too much - note how nice and open your &quot;8&quot; is. Your &quot;7&quot; is killer. I might make the zero rounder. <BR> <BR>Accents: they seem unfinished, at least in terms of placement. I'd just say that your ring might be a little too light, and you could raise the umlauts a bit, esp in the lc. <BR> <BR>I'd make the &quot;ae&quot; one glyph: flatten the top of the &quot;a&quot;'s bowl to unite the strokes; get rid of the &quot;a&quot;'s stem at the baseline. The slashes on your &quot;O&quot;/&quot;o&quot;/cent are too steep. The Yen's top bar is clotting. The dollar looks unbalanced - but to be honest I actually like to encourage ugly dollarsigns. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Hrant <BR> <BR>I totally see your comments - I actually looked at the lc 'k' and 'm' today and thought the same. I didn't see the w being too wide though, but I shall revisit it and make amendments - the point about the middle part being lowered I understand and will investigate. <BR> <BR>The UC does have a problem with its proportions which I think comes from me being a total (but hungry) novice. The colour imbalance is again a problem which I feel stems from both my 'beginner' approach and my relative inexperience with the software - they looked fine on paper! I do need to make a decision as to their proportions. <BR> <BR>The numerals are a first draft and the '6' and '9' do need opening up I agree. Thanks for the positive comments - I was a little nervous as the previous lining numerals were awful, and I wasn't totally sure about these ones - although I felt they were a lot better than their predecessors. This is pretty much the first time they have all been put together with the other characters. <BR> <BR>The accents again are 'work in progress' and do need some tweaking. The 'ring' does need some weight adding to it.  <BR> <BR>The 'ae' glyph has gone a little crazy - I just looked at the paper based drawing and on that I had removed the a's stem - quality control a little lax there! The comments about the other characters I will take on board when I make some amendments. <BR> <BR>Thanks very much for your input - your comments are greatly valued. <BR> <BR>I'll post a revision up as soon as it's ready. <BR> <BR>Cheers <BR> <BR>Darren</div>

Old-style numerals, in general, are best for text settings, of course, but lining numerals are generally preferred for headlines and tabular columns. With a versatile font like this one, the inclusion of both types of numerals would be most appropriate. <BR> <BR>Hrant mentioned most of the suggestions that I noticed (and a few that I thought were fine as they are, but I'll be interested to see how you incorporate them anyway&hellip; <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> ). <BR> <BR>As far as your upper-case proportions, take a look at: <BR> <BR>Adobe Trajan (<A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4465.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4465.html">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4465.html</a></A>), <BR> <BR>Adobe Charlemagne (<A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily1163.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily1163.html">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily1163.html</a></A>) or <BR> <BR>Adobe Penumbra (<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_907.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_907.html">http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_907.html</a></A>) <BR> <BR>for comparison.

It's hard to know if Darren intends this to be a text face (and frankly that almost doesn't matter: the hardest part of making a text face is &quot;simply&quot; convincing others that it's a text face!), although some things (like the OS nums) seem to indicate that.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Joe here. <BR> <BR>In general I agree with the common notion that good text faces tend to be serified, but I also point out that there are several excellent exceptions to this rule. Franklin Gothic, Helvetica, Univers, Bureau Gothic, Officina, Meta, Gill Sans, Radiant, Syntax, and Scala Sans (among many others) are all examples of serifless faces that work well for setting some text applications. <BR> <BR>No font, serifed or serifless, works equally well for setting all text applications. <BR> <BR>If we have learned anything typographically in the 20th century, it is that to talented designers, the long-held rules of typography must be both followed and broken. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">  <BR> <BR>Remember also that Carter's &quot;snap-on serifs&quot; were an experiment in themselves; classic serifs were designed into the font from day one, never designed as an afterthought to be snapped on after the fact. <BR> <BR>In my view, Iris stands alone as a well-designed (and evolving) sans-serif face, and that direction should be seen through to the end. A serifed version can come later. <BR> <BR>Watching this one grow with much interest, <BR> <BR>David</div>

There has been a lot written about the Walker type. One good article can be found in Eye no. 19 (1995). It's all about how the font was comissioned and designed.

Even during my studies in Holland. The good thing about the font is not only its quality, but it reflexes your love, interest and willingness to design type!! Which is often difficult to find. <BR> <BR>I am curious about your serifed version. Because in your font the ending are very typical and therefore pretty important for its character. And that is where later on the serifs will be! <BR> <BR>About the textface issue. Guys, we live in 21st Century! Last century some designers proved us, sansserifs can be used and designed very well as textfaces!</div>

I'll check it out. <BR> <BR>Now that I think about it, Letterhead Fonts and others (Font Diner's Milwaukee, I think it's called) have a similar concept, that is fonts that you build by layering two fonts together. Walker seems like its the first to do this with self-contained serifs. <BR> <BR>This is something I'm going to experiment with surely because I want to find out 'how' to do it and because the font is 'private', that makes it more interesting. It may be uncommercial but all work and no play makes jack a dull boy, eh? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> (That's just a reference to an American movie, The Shining w/ Jack Nicholson, no hidden meanings or anything.) <BR> <BR>re, the serifs: A readability question. Why do serifs help us recognize words better?  Growing up, kids see a lot of san-serifs, especially when they are learning 'lettering' in first grade. Does anyone have a short answer?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Readability in the future would make a nice discussion topic <BR> <BR>Totally. I think -like you implied- it depends a lot on display technology. LCDs are becoming standard, which means ClearType-style technology will be a big factor, but also I think there's room for more hand-crafting of bitmaps, very much so in grayscale. <BR> <BR>&gt; no hidden meanings or anything <BR> <BR>Yeah, right (you obsessive, ax-wielding font freak). <BR> <BR>&gt; Why do serifs help us recognize words better? <BR> <BR>It's hard to keep it short (especially when one has to first dismiss a bunch of traditional but laughable theories - like the one that says they help guide the eye like train tracks&hellip; gimme a break, linespacing already does that 100 times better, thank you very much), but I see it as two-pronged: <BR> <BR>1. Serifs help distinguish one glyph from another (to varying extents). <BR> <BR>2. Serifs help glyphs coalesce into boumas (word shapes), instead of standing out individually. Kind of like why tight spacing helps readability, noting that if you space a sans too tightly the counters overpower the inter-letter spacing (ruining the distribution of color in a bouma), while in a serif face the serifs start touching (facilitating the coalesce thing) before that happens/needs_to_happen. <BR> <BR>This is in addition to the familiarity factor (which some people however over-rate). <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
