  body: Thanks... Anyone have info on Book Antiqua? Other than that Agfa-Monotype
    owns it. It looks &#34;Lyrical Modernist&#34; as per Bringhurst&#39;s classification.
    Who designed it, and when? Is it based on older forms/script?

    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino/italic-old-style-figures/testdrive.html?s=Dahlq&amp;p=60">Palatino</a>?
    Is there a subtle difference in the sample that I&#39;m failing to notice? <BR>
    <BR>tim: Book Antiqua is a &#40;notoriously unauthorised&#41; copy of Hermann
    Zapf&#39;s Palatino, originally designed in 1948.'

  body: It could be either, I just looked through my fonts that came with my computer
    and came up with what I thought was an exact match.. I didn&#39;t know about the
    background of Book Antiqua and how similar it was to Palatino.

  body: No, it&#39;s Palatino! Look at the top serif on the q, or the shape of the
    top of the a. Definitely not Renaissance.
