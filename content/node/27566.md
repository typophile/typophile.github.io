    make use of custom lettering. Lots of bold scripty stuff in the vein of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.11320.5.18&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Yumyoms%21&sampleSize=48\">Strada</a>

    Over half of the content didn't even print out! I did send an email to recieve
    new ones though lol.\r\n\r\nWell recently mentioned Louise Fili has some great
    food packaging. Might not help too much with japenese candy packaging though.
    Maybe look at all the designer toys that are out now? Only one I can think of
    right now is kidrobot but a google search for \"designer toys\" brings up a few
    others."

  body: "Funny you should mention \"designer toys\",  j_polo9... I made a simplified
    version of Tim Biskup's (http://www.timbiskup.com) \"Helper\" (you gotta love
    that guy!) that I might include in the dingbats. I'll contact him first to see
    if he doesn't have any objections.\r\nMy \"designer toys\" are actually what started
    all this in the first place. I was working on a illustration for a kind of make-your-own-monster
    factory in the tradition of Mr. Potato Head (choosing from different expressions,
    arms, etc.) & wanted to make a custom lettering logo for my \"Monstr-O-Matic\".
    That soon became an entire font with additional dingbats.\r\nI'll be posting the
    fonts hopefully somewhere this week for professional feedback."

    strikes me as a clever design in terms of economy, sacrificing number of colours
    for the die-cutting, others in the range use the same silhouette of the fruit
    with a good strong colour choice \u2013 lovely jam too. I am going to try to make
    a greengage jam this afternoon a first and something that might go terribly wrong
    but my plum tree is groaning under the weight and I don't want to leave it to
