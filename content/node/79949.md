body: Trying to save a graphic artist some time. this was too low on the artwork and
  is going to get cut off when printed. So if I can just figure out the font I can
  retype it out and move it up for him. Thanks for your help!

    Vertical]] with some [[http://www.identifont.com/list?3+Huxley%20Vertical+3+8EC+7+647+4+24X+4+8ED+4+3TS+4+26TB+0+HTJ+0+8V6+0+GF5+0+A5A+0+4K7+0+C3G+0+A3B+0+67I+0+40Z+0+8RZ+0+8W8+0+8V5+0+6VU+0+4V5+0+4UX+0+QV+0+4UJ+0+4UD+0+57F+0+4U7+0+P1+0+2Y3+0|Alternates]].
