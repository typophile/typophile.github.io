body: "Hey everyone. Sorry about the subject title...needed something to lure you
  in :D\r\n\r\nAnyways, I posted a similar thread in this forum called Kill this layout!
  (Are we seeing a pattern here?), wherein I have a selection of layout ideas that
  I have presented for lambasting by Typophile frequenters, e.g. hrant, Birdseeding,
  sanderpe.\r\n\r\n15 weeks on, I have boiled down the best of those ideas, argued
  constructively with the powers-that-be for a decent budget for fonts, and tried
  to learn how to do Illustrator, to come up with [[http://goo.gl/WegIxn|this]].\r\n\r\nTypefaces
  are Coranto 2 and Flama, and I'm planning on having Acta (and possibly Acto) and
  Meta Serif on the Features section. Nameplate is custom-made based on Coranto 2
  and Flama. Icon is a close-up of the Prometheus statue in Rockefeller Center. Prometheus
  is the bringer of fire in Greek mythology, I'll have you know.\r\n\r\nThere. Now,
  thoughts?"
