    sign painters, and these professions are still alive today. It&#39;s a bit of
    a shame that we don&#39;t get a bit more discussion of this sort of work at Typophile. '

    lettering was much more important/more valued/more powerful than it is today.
    I think, for example, we have yet to have a discussion here at Typoophile about
    the title and credits letterers of movies from the days when it was all done by
    hand. It never ceases to amaze me how brilliant these &#34;old-time&#34; movie-titling
    artists were. '

  body: ' I&#39;m going to propose that the art and artistry of lettering is not less
    valued today. I&#39;m guessing that the businessmen of the sign painter era were
    just as annoying to work with. There is something inherent in hand lettering that
    allows for more innovation. Every time the letters are drawn they have to be reinterpreted.
    Often within the same word you&#39;ll see different treatments of the same letter.
    If designers were to custom render letterforms more frequently in our era, we
    would see an amazing typographic renaisance. '

    Not that innovation is difficult in lettering, but it&#39;s certainly not any

  body: ' I agree that we have seen somewhat of a renaisance in the last few years
    with typographic experimentation via the computer. However, a sign or logo that
    uses an umodified font &#40;whether there are a million or ten million fonts available&#41;
    is still constrained in ways that a sign created from scratch isn&#39;t. In other
    words, I think there is a false separation between typographers and type designers.
    If more typographers were to create the letters they use for logos, titles, signs
    etc., we would see much more diversity and innovation. '

    Edward Catich &#40;although I think he died before finishing up&#41;, Gerard Unger
    &#40;although he -fortunately- doesn&#39;t take Trajan too literally&#41;, and
    then there&#39;s Latina by Inigo Jerez Quintana &#40;with a sans too&#41;. This
