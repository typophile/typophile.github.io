  body: I think Universal Everything made the packaging, but it looks like The Design
    Republic &#40;TDR&#41; actually did the design. I think it is a custom typeface.
    Warp records is one of the TDR clients.

  body: You could also check out <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/burin-sans/burin-sans/testdrive.html?s=BOUNCE+MAKE+MODEL&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Burin Sans</a>. Letters have different shapes but it&#39;s nice
    and thin. The M in your sample looks like a W flipped upside down.
