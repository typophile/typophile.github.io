    can't believe the price they are charging for this--$160 for four fonts, and three
    of them are simple variants, two of which could be created with a single action

    the ProSpeed Competition rather missed the point though.\r\n\r\nIn 1971 Porsche
    commissioned SERA (a French aerospace consultancy) to refine the aerodynamics
    of Porsche 917k [img:sites/default/files/old-images/917k_4921.jpg] for the Le
    Mans race, they evolved the shape into the 917/20[img:sites/default/files/old-images/91720_4673.jpg]
    The people back at Porsche decided that it looked like a pig and lettered it with
    the names of the various cuts in German. The car was entered in the race by Porsche
    Austria whose sponspors Martini refused to allow any Martini branding on the car,
    which retired during the night, crashing because of brake failure."

  body: "Thanks for the Fontbank connection, Mike. I'd wondered where he got the Vivian
    name, since he almost always uses the original name.\r\n\r\nPhilippe, from the
    MyFonts forum, and I are starting to think that Steffmann's fonts are, in fact,
    mostly made up of preexisting fonts that he made modifications to. By modifications,
    I mean converting to a Windows format, providing the alternates that were available
    in the original typeface, or, in many cases, simply filling out the character
    set. Some appear to be clones of the Solo/Dover fonts. I suspect, but don't know
    for sure, that some of the blackletter digitizations are from scratch, though.\r\n\r\nMost
    of the originals for fonts he simply modified are no longer around (unless they're
    in the Opti dungeons of Castcraft). I wouldn't be surprised if his Vivian was
    released during the time that Fontbank was defunct and its fonts (which aren't
    entirely original in themselves) were gone from the scene - before Xara claimed
    to have obtained the rights to market them again."

    about this paint scheme, the odder it seems.\r\n\r\nMotor racing in general, and
    particularly the Porsche 917 in its various guises has long been a fascination
    of mine.\r\n\r\nIt undoubtedly was created in 1971, and the popular version of
    the story is that the pig \"joints\" and names were done as a bit of fun when
    the body came back from the aerodynamicists 5 inches wider (7ft 3in!) and generally
    much bulkier than its sleeker cousins.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of letters on the
    car and it seems an odd font to choose in the days before computer plotters.\r\n\r\nUnless
    perhaps it was in general use in butcher's shops around Stuttgart in the late
    60s.\r\n\r\nMy (early 80s) Letraset catalogue doesn't offer anything helpful.\r\n\r\nPS
