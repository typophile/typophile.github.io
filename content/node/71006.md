  typographic trends for web or interactive media. The discussion will center primarily
  around the aesthetics vs. the technical aspects of type. I'm hoping y'all can help
  me round up some examples and thoughts on what you're seeing as trends. \r\n\r\nFor
  example, in my daily perusing I have noticed that a lot of sites are using larger
  and larger type, often slab-serifs. There's also the ubiquitous Helvetica showing
  up on everything regardless of appropriateness, but that's a whole different topic.
  \r\n\r\nWould love to hear your thoughts."
