  body: "Microgramma Ext. (and an outlined derivative, Bitstream Millenium) was used
    for some of the Starfleet hull markings in Star Trek.\r\nThe font in the titles
    was an obliqued version of Horizon, available from Bitstream. They once sold a
    collection of Star Trek fonts.\r\n\r\nThrow some screen grabs up, if you have
    anything specific you want to know about. I don't have any handy, but I'm sure
    some people do."
