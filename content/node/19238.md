body: "Please can somebody help me for the Melissa font set. Ulrich Stiehl told me
  that he has already checked that neither Linotype/Monotype/FontShop nor www.fonts.com
  nor www.myfonts.com supply this font, but perhaps a small typefoundry has digitized
  the font Melissa and sells it under another name.\r\nI'm looking for a special occassion
  to the \"Melissa Inline von Letragraphica LG2320\" from 1977 designed by Douglas
  Sheldrake \r\n\r\nPlease look to the inserted image for the right Melissa font.
  \r\nMaybe there are other fonts with the same name \"Melissa\", because there are
  also other completely different fonts also called \"Melissa\". For example, Compugraphic
  called its forgery of Zapf's Melior as \"Melissa\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/melissa.jpg]\r\n\r\nIts
  no problem to buy the fontset. Please let me know if somebody can help me.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your concerns.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nLouis van der Veer\r\nNetherlands"
