  body: "Like I told you before, Nick, you should lay out a nice specimen book of
    some or all of your fonts, perhaps with a short biography woven through it.  Sell
    it publish on demand, or get funding through kickstarter.  I'm not just gonna
    give you free money out of pity, especially since I have never used or downloaded
    any of your fonts.  \r\n\r\nYou have a good hook as they say, you have created
    over 1100 fonts.  This makes you interesting, even to the public at large who
    barely know what fonts are.  I could see you getting press or perhaps even getting
    on some national tv talk shows as 'the man who created 1100 fonts.'  But don't
    whine about your misfortune and hold your hand out like a common beggar. Nobody
    respects that."
