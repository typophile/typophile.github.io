    really depends on your motivation. In the case of digitizing an older typeface
    or lettering sample, if no other exists and you are open about your sources and
    motivation (assuming you plan to make it available publically or commercially)
    and if done well then it can often be a useful excercise and of benefit to people."

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\nI am aware of the tendency of calling those \"altered\" type
    designs \"distressed\". It\u2018s just that I never felt comfortable with both
    english terms (\"grunge\" and \"distressed\"). I never felt at home with the general
    attitude most english-speaking and dutch designers were using during the early
    1990s avant-gardes which let to lettering and type experimentation, because they
    weren\u2019t related to my personal experiences.\r\nTh biggest problem I have
    is that \"distressed\" implies an association with inner feelings which are not
    necessarily the ones fueling the inspiration.\r\nThe reasons may be varied as
    much as the reasons which prompt to do a new take or experiment on established
    typographic categories, so the definition should reflect that, without implying
    certain emotional states or feelings.\r\nOf course, there was a sense of anguish
    and disorientation in the mid-1990s, for young people which were getting older
    in that period, but this wasn\u2019t the only (or the main) element of inspiration
    for producing \u201Cdistressed\u201D type. Another silly term was \u201Cegyptian\u201D
    but luckily it\u2019s mostly gone\u2026 :-)"

  body: "Claudio, I\u2019ve never considered <strong>Distressed</strong> to mean an
    emotional state, when applied to type.\r\nBefore its use to describe a genre of
    type, I was already familiar with its long-standing meaning as applied to antiques
    (furniture etc.) and pseudo-antiques: \u201CIntentionally marred or faded to convey
    an antique or used look\u201D.\r\nAlso, I don\u2019t believe that types have inherent
    emotional qualities.\r\nTherefore, to use an existing craft manufacturing term
    to describe a style of type seemed quite straightforward, especially as the design
    process is one where a perfect shape is corrupted, tainted, or marred.\r\n\r\n<strong>Grunge</strong>
    has a broader meaning, as it quite often refers to what has never been anywhere
    near perfection.\r\nTypeface: Amoeba, or anything roughly hand-made.\r\n\r\n<strong>Deconstruction</strong>
    was another mid-90s method, typically involving a mash-up of contrasting styles.\r\nTypeface:
    Fudoni, Dead History, Keedy Sans.\r\n\r\nAll these three terms describe things
    that are less-than-perfect, but in quite different ways.\r\n\r\nWhat are the words
    for \u201Cdistressed\u201D, meaning the antiquing of furniture, in other languages?"

    in italian should be \"anticato\" (i.e. \"made antique\"). Was that the meaning
    to which you referred?\r\n\r\nWhile I agree on \"destructural\" (but I preferred
    \"post-structural\", as once you \"destructured\" you must have \"reconstructed\"
    to some degree, to obtain something which more or less works), I still think \"grunge\"
    is a bit \"anything goes\" kind of term. I quite liked Jens' Amoeba, and never
    thought of it as \"grunge\". Rather I thought it was ingenious, as the idea of
    parts \"washed away\" was incorporated into the design. A different approach than,
    say, the one by Barry Deck.\r\n\r\n@mikougnie: Your post has nothing to do with
    the topic at hand: there is a specific section here on the forums for type identification
