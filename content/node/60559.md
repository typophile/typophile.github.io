  for a meat company. I have been asked to redesign their current logo and update
  their brand.\r\n\r\nThey have been around since 1959 and thinking that I would like
  to do a direction that would pay homage to that era and industry.\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be most appreciated and thank you in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    historian so typography is out of my realm but I thought I'd suggest some things
    for you to take with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nI was thinking script like one of
    the examples below:\r\n\r\nURW Accent\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/urw_accent_normal/?&sample_text=Tasty%20Meats&sample_size=48\r\n\r\nSpills\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/comicraft/spills_regular/?&sample_text=Tasty%20Meats&sample_size=48\r\n\r\nReporter
    no 2\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/reporter_no_2_std_regular/?&sample_text=Tasty%20Meats&sample_size=48\r\n\r\nI
    would date each of them slightly earlier than 1959 in general feeling but again...
    I am not a type historian or a designer.  I cannot stress that enough."
