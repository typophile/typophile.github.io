  the font they use is called, and if possible where I can get it from. Any help will
  be greatly recieved. Simply 'Google' \"Pacha logo\" to see the font, or have a look
  at the attachment.\r\n\r\nCheers guys,\r\n\r\nRich"

  body: This is most probably a custom designed logo. Maybe there are freeware fonts
    similar to this. I already did a quick check of the [[Fontalicious]] collection,
    but couldn't find it there.

  body: Don't hold your breath. As I said, this probably is a custom designed logo,
    so chances are pretty slim that there's a font out there looking like this.
