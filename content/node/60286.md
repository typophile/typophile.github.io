  <a href=\"http://www.idsgn.org/posts/designing-type-with-cars/\">Designing type
  with cars</a>.\r\n\r\n<em>In a project sponsored by Toyota, Belgium-based design
  duo Pierre Smeets and Damien Aresta (of pleaseletmedesign) teamed up with race car
  driver Stefan van Campenhoudt to create a typeface using a car and some sophisticated
  software.\r\n\r\nThe project made use of a new Toyota iQ specially outfitted with
  4 color markers, used for tracking its position. Interactive artist Zach Lieberman
  from openFrameworks (who creates a lot of cool stuff like this) was the brains behind
  the custom software which tracked the car in realtime as it was filmed from above.
  The software used the car\u2019s motion paths to create the vector outlines which
  were then used by the type designers to create the free iQ Agility Font.</em>\r\n\r\nThere's
  even a font to download.\r\n\r\n(Apologies if this has already been posted. I also
  wanted to get this up here because I was talking up idsgn to a bunch of people at
  TypeCon and this serves as a way to share the site.)"
