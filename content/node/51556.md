  body: "Not \"LIGA\" but \"liga\". \r\n\r\nAll registered OpenType Layout feature
    tags are listed at:\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/OTSPEC/featurelist.htm\r\n\r\nAnd
    the OpenType Layout feature tags as supported by popular applications are listed
    at:\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support\r\n\r\nYou're
    free to use your own OpenType Layout tags that are not registered, but this means
    that you need to write your own layout application to use them. They won't work
    in Illustrator. In your particular case, all ligature substitutions should be
    defined in the \"liga\" feature. \r\n\r\nBTW, for a glyph that is a ligature of
    the glyphs \"j\", \"m\" and \"n\", the glyphname \"j_m_n\" would be better than
    \"_0000\". Please refer to the glyph naming and encoding chapter in the FontLab
    Studio manual. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: Wow, that's kind of cool using a screen cast to pose a question. If you had
    to rely just on explaining the problem with text, I don't think the solution would
    have been quite so obvious without a few rounds of back and forth with the experts
    here. I don't know if this is something a lot of people are going to start doing,
    but it's an interesting idea.

  body: "@ twardoch - Thanks a lot man, your explanation helped me solve this problem
    :) It makes perfect sense that you can't make up feature names yourself. I should
    have thought about that, hehe. I just need to get some more experience with FontLab.\r\n\r\n@
    Mark Simonson - You know what they say: \"A picture is worth a thousand words\"
    so a on minute clip playing at 30 pictures per second has got to be worth shitload
    of words (pardon my French) :p\r\n\r\n"
