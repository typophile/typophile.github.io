  body: Scala was overused in the 90s, but it has been a while since I've seen it.
    Maybe it is due for a comeback? But I would be inclined to look around for something
    fresher.

  body: "Actually less fashion, more lifestyle supplement for a small politics and
    culture magazine. I would have wanted to try and test, but this one has to happen
    in a week's time - an experiment more like.\r\nBesides, I have access to very
    few new typefaces. I see scala used really nicely in Theme magazine. http://www.thememagazine.com/.
    Would have liked to use Verlag or something similar for headlines, though I am
    also trying combinations like Fedra Sans Display and Greta Text; Cholla for display
    with Fedra Text.\r\n\r\ncheers"
