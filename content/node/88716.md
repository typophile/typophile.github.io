  type-based shirts. Can you help identify what the typefaces are? Sorry there is
  obviously more than one here.\r\nHappy new year, and thanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type2_4415.gif]"

  body: 'The actual shirts were done from the actual wood type. I was bummed that
    I couldn''t find any at our local Targets. Alas, I''m not sure about the tags...looks
    like they were, as oldnick points out, not related to the actual wood type in
    any way. '

  body: "Aluminum- bummer you couldnt find any of them, they are definitely refreshing,
    especially at Target. As for the tags, yes it would make sense to have them match
    the wood cut purpose, but it's a nice array in it's own right related or not.\r\nYou
    might be able to grab some shirts still, I've seen them on eBay, for example:\r\nhttp://goo.gl/rzXYp\r\n\r\nGillo
    -\r\nthanks for your entries on it, and nice ID's, thank you. I have ID'd the
    other font as being Knockout No.66.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nW"
