body: QUARK 6.1  <BR>MAC OS X  <BR>--------------  <BR> <BR>Okay, new problem.  <BR>
  <BR>One of the girls in the creative department has been getting an error after
  a couple times pdf-ing an ad.  <BR> <BR>The error has something to do with &#34;itc
  franklin gothic med cd&#34; and she can&#39;t get rid of this error until she closes
  out of quark completely.  <BR> <BR>Then when she opens it back up, does a couple
  more pdf&#39;s and BAM... there is the same error again.  <BR> <BR>And she just
  keeps doing that repetitive loop.  <BR> <BR>Any idea whats going on?  Anyone else
  have this problem?

  body: It might help if you could tell folks what the error is, exactly. Also, more
    details on the workflow and the font usage. For example, is the font being used
    directly in Quark in the ad? Or is it in an EPS or PDF or something placed in
    the ad? <BR> <BR>Do you have more than one copy of this font installed on the
    computer? Perhaps both a Type 1 version and a system dfont or something? <BR>
    <BR>&#40;Not that I personally know much about Quark 6.1 trouble shooting, as
    I work at Adobe. Just sort of standard procedure, y&#39;know?&#41; <BR> <BR>Cheers,
    <BR> <BR>T

    server or her computer.

    &#40;corrupted&#41; some font suitcases after using them with it. <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    the same nasty bug. &#40;Its not a joke&#41;

    is a pain. Quark Xpress is more sensitive to font management issues that ever

    users are employing. Like you say, if not, you cannot leave a robot outputting
    pdf files and proofs all night long. &#60;snip&#62; <BR><b><a href="http://software-robotics.com/db_user_forums/viewtopic.php?t=203">Quark

  body: I&#39;ve had this problem with Quark a bunch of times too. I hate Quark, and
    now I only use it when I have to. InDesign is so much better - Unfortunatly it
    can only read old Quark files. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: Hi everybody, <BR> <BR>I have just upgraded my system to OSX 10.3 and quark
    to version 6.1. The thing is that the program has become very unstable and while
    I am working it keeps shutting down without any specific reason. I work for a
    publisher and usually pages are quite full of images and formulas. However I never
    experienced anything similar using Xpress 4 for OS9. <BR>Fonts should not be the
    issue as we are working with an origilan adobe font folio 10 package and apparently
    there are no conflicts. Has anyone experienced the same problem? Any solutions?
    <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks to everyone

  body: Dude, with regard to font problems. . .  If you really think a simple clean
    font library will save you the horrors of Mac OS X and fonts, you&#39;re in for
    a ride.  Fonts on Mac OS X are Hell.  Atleast until you clean out the many multiple
    font locations and get to a state of control.  Then your clean adobe folio will
    work really well. <b><a href="http://software-robotics.com/docs/PDF-X-Robot_Font_Management.html"
    target="_blank">&#42;Font Management Issues on Mac OS X Here!</a></b> <BR> <BR>Another
    VERY important read, when you are done with that is to really get accomodated
    to <b><a href="http://software-robotics.com/docs/PDF-X-Robot_OS_X_Maintenance.html"
    target="_blank">&#42;Disk and File System Maintenance on Mac OS X Here!</a></b>
    Mac OS X should not be crashing out like that, in case it&#39;s not a font conflict
    or problem, be sure you understand proper maintenance, like using some of the
    old stand by utilities will send you endless doom.  Good luck!
