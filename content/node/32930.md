    body: how about now? It looks like copperplate but it is much thicker.

  body: Well it's definitely NOT the Bitstream or Linotype versions.

  body: You can get Copperplate in many different weights... I thought it might have
    been scaled vertically and horisontally, but this still doesn't expalain the middle
    foot serif in M and the length of middle line in E, which differ from Copperplate.
    Of course it is possible that those were "tuned" individually.

  body: Didn't IKEA use to have serifs? I wonder if this isn't based upon that somehow.

  body: "I don't think so, Tiff -- the only serifed version of IKEA I remember didn't
    remind me of Copperplate.  My guess is that Tiina's assumption is right: probably
    <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/12924/copperplategothic30ab-font.html\">CG 30</a>,
    and then tweaked.\r\n\r\nThat middle foot serif in M is rare enough, although
    I can't tell from the spec sheet of <a href=\"http://www.galapagosdesign.com/original/baltra.htm\">Baltra</a>
    also has one, but Dennis is pretty upfront in saying that it's an homage to CG
    30...."
