body: "Good evening,\r\n\r\nI'm finally working on my first typeface! Yay. It's a
  conservative, old-style text serif and it will look like <a href=\"http://aldusleaf.org/\">this</a>.
  It'll be an open source project that I work on in my free time.\r\n\r\nSince I have
  no typographic education whatsoever (I'm an engineering freshman straight out of
  highschool with a type addiction), I need some help: how do I space letters horizontally?
  I just finished the lowercase letters and I already spend most of my time changing
  side bearings and kernings instead of drawing letters. That is annoying and frustrating.
  It's a constant shifting of letters back and forth, and I never seem to get the
  spacing quite even.\r\n\r\nSo how do you do it right\u2014and I mean right from
  the start? Is there a special order in which you start spacing? Are there percentage
  guidelines for average space between stems/bowls? Can you point me to software to
  help me do it (I'm running FontForge on Ubuntu)?\r\n\r\nI appreciate your support!\r\n\r\nSebastian"

  body: "All the above. But I'll especially reiterate the advice to finish the spacing
    before you start kerning. And after you *think* you've finished, work with it
    for at least several weeks before you let yourself kern. Seriously, this is probably
    the advice that will save you the second greatest amount of grief ever in type
    design.\r\n\r\n(The greatest amount of grief to be saved is by never even attempting
    type design in the first place. It is simply a craft that is full of frustrations.
    But of much job as well.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    Well, they count for nothing.\r\n\r\nIn my case (I think I can give this away
    safely), Google/Raph plan to send it to iKern soon, specifically so I can spend
    more time on letter drawing. That may or may not sound like a sacrilege to you,
    but frankly, I'm grateful for not having to do the spacing/kerning.\r\n\r\n(I'll
    update this thread as soon as that is done, with better sample files, too. It's
    easier to critique letters in an even-looking context, I'd assume ...)\r\n"

    else work on the kerning is one thing, but if you don\u2019t get the basic spacing
    down first the kerning isn\u2019t going to make the font any better. If your basic
    spacing doesn\u2019t work, how are you even supposed to know that your letters
    have been drawn well and work together? Or is this one of those open-source things
    where if the users want it finished they have to do it themselves? "

    five weights I'll take care of this week.\r\n\r\nAnd for the record, iKern doesn't
    do kerning without spacing (how would an algorithm do that, anyway?). AFAIK it
    finds good letter-to-letter distances, sets the side bearings and then fills in
    kerning values for the combinations that don't fit.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's hard
    to judge the quality of the letters in an unspaced font. Point taken.\r\n\r\n<em>Or
    is this one of those open-source things where if the users want it finished they
