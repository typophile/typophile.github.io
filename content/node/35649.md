  -- not nearly as invisible as a book face should be -- because in my eyes the lc
  <em>d</em> and <em>p</em> are well below the x-height. It isn't that noticeable
  in this scan (possibly because it's bigger on screen).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd like to
  know what it is.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uncle-tungsten-serif.jpg]"

  body: Is it ITC Garamond? Hard to tell at that small size.

  body: Garamond No 3 is very similar (maybe the same thing under another name?).
    I believe it's based on Jannon, not the original Garamond. Personally, I like
    it as a book face. It's slight quirkiness gives it a warmth suitable for certain
    topics.

  body: I think Garamond No 3 is closer than the DT (the "crook" of the <em>g</em>
    is sharper, and the serifs on the <em>d</em> slope down less) but I'm still a
    type ID newbie.
