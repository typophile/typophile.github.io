    has many weights/variants, and all make for yummy pub design."

    why is the sample (on his website) set in Dutch?"

    the exact models of scanners and Macs \u2013 do they no longer do this?"

    broke, and without enough client work to get the 5-computer license.  Anyone know
    how I could just pick up the individual weights ?"

  body: "str\xF6m, the per-font pricing for Freight within the packages is a great
    deal, but I know sometimes it's hard to swing a whole family... you could try
    contacting Josh and/or his Freight publisher, Ralph Smith at Phil's Fonts/GarageFonts
    about your project specifics and needs. They are both super nice guys and great
    to work with.\r\n\r\nRalph > info [at] philsfonts [dot] com\r\nJosh > use contact

    could drum up a few for the sans, though. I take it you own library CDs from those
    other foundries?"

  body: Speaking of Wired's typefaces... Whatever happened to Carter & Cone's custom
    variation of Walbaum for Wired called "Wiredbaum"? The magazine stopped using
    it in a redesign years ago, but the typeface hasn't turned up since, even though
    it still looks great.
