  any good examples from the most knowledgable members of Typophile\r\n\r\n(2) would
  love to a bit of Type ID of the this great poster of The Man Who Fell To Earth.\r\n\r\nSome
  of the letter looks in the vicinity of BureauGrotesque but the O is definitely different\u2014my
  guess would be custom but again, would appreciate any help on this.\r\n\r\n"

    some analog means. Every letter is unique.

  body: "@stephen\_\u2014\_you got me there, I should have said 50s / 60s, but even
    then I'd be off my own brief. Just came across this and liked the type.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, if you do know of any good examples of film titles and / or posters
    from 50s / 60s it'd be appreciated.\r\n\r\n@butterick \u2014 I stand corrected. "

  body: "In the 1950s and 60s, Saul Bass (1920-1996) was the superstar designer of
    film titles and film posters. His film credits included:\r\n\r\nThe Man withe
    the Golden Arm\r\nAnatomy of a Murder\r\nAround the World in 80 Days\r\nPsycho\r\nIt\u2019s
    a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\r\nNorth by Northwest\r\nVertigo\r\nSpartacus\r\nExodus\r\nWest
    Side Story\r\n\r\nLike many of his contemporaries, he was a talented creator of
    handlettered headlines, so some of his best work may be described in terms of
    graphic design or letterforms, but not as typography <em>per se</em>."

    might just get in touch. :)"
