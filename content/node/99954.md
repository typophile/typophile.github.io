  body: "Ryuk, especially looking at the designer's other fonts and considering his
    association with Apostrophe, I personally wouldn't feel comfortable recommending
    that. And I don't mean because it's too tightly spaced...  :-/\r\n\r\nBetter safe
    than sorry.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Even if I can only relay on you for the rest of Graham Meade's GemFonts and
    part of being inspirated by Helvetica (as almost all sans' since it ;)), I really
    don't feel uncomfortable recommending it. You're the expert so if you find any
    font which Walkway could have been based on, I would be glad to edit my post and
    remove the ID. To my eyes, it looks enough different from anything I know, perfectly
    assuming it is not safe to relay on my poor knowledge and memory.\r\nBTW, do you
    think all Graham Meade's GemFonts should be considered as \"not to be recommended\"?\r\nStupid
    question now. If I recognize Arial for instance, should you recommend not to ID
    it or to say \"This is Arial, a very well-known Helvetica knock-off\"? "

  body: "Just to be clear: I don't consider myself an expert; it's simply that when
    you actually go to the trouble of making a full font, red flags go up when you
    see that sort of thing. I'd be curious to find out what proportion of people who
    regularly ID fonts have ever made one (I mean that other people would want to
    actually purchase).\r\n\r\nBut I actually think your stance is OK (it's all relative
    after all) and thank you for the offer of amending your post if something turns
    up. I myself am more cautious, but I'm not going to try to force people to be
    like me - that's crazy. Pressure, sometimes - force, never. And pressure only
    when I think it helps the community. At least that's my intention - sometimes
    I slip.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>do you think all Graham Meade's GemFonts should be
    considered as \"not to be recommended\"?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI would try to avoid
    making such a blanket damning statement. But I guess if I had a choice between
    recommending between two similar fonts I would prefer the one that's not \"guilty
    by association\".\r\n\r\nAgain: I'm not trying to control anybody - I'm simply
    trying to help this particular community. And if anybody ever feels guilty for
    some action here, I have to feel that I'm not wasting my time. You can't learn
    without making mistakes.\r\n\r\nArial: Some people do avoid it as you describe.
    I'm not that strict. For one thing, Arial's outlines are original (the spacing
    was indeed copied however - but I don't mind that) and its texture is sufficiently
    different. But you're right if you mean that corporations aren't saints: just
    look at Chalkboard!  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Well, if its of any interest to you at all, hrant, Walkway was  an incomplete
    font I did, completely from scratch using simple lines and circles in Fontographer.
    \ Yes, it is crap.  It has nothing taken from anyone elses fonts at all. It shouldnt
    have been posted anywhere, as it was still being worked on, I sent it nto someone
    to have a look at, and they spread the thing around without me knowing\r\n\r\nMost
    of the stuff I did is crap,  it's crap by association :D\r\n\r\nNot that what
    I say is going to make any difference anyway, hrants correct, avoid walkway and
    get something better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
