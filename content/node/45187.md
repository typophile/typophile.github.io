    Indesign files. Furthermore, even Indesign has problems importing Quark files
    unless they're saved as version 4 files in Quark.  Why an Indesign file won't
    open from PC to Mac I can't be certain other than with possible PC vs. Mac font
    issues.  Are the two versions of Indesign on the Mac and PC the same?\r\n\r\nSorry
    I can't shed any further light.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "I cannot shed any light on this either. I have enough headaches with InDesign
    - like it condensing graphics brought in - will not let me see whole graphic --
    too busy expanding it to fit area rather than give me my entire photo... etc.
    etc. - oh wait, my favorite - not allowing me to change color of type. Must quit
    out, wait about 10 minutes, go back in and then it allows it... very quirky -
    more so than Quark ever was.\r\n\r\nBut... if you need help right away maybe these
    time savers can help you: Could you try to save it as a PDF - and then open you
    can bring it to any computer - and import the \"graphic\" into Quark. If you have
    Acrobat or Illustrator on the other computers you can then edit it... \r\n\r\nSorry
    I can't be more helpful. Have I told you lately:  I don't like InDesign? I think
    I've finally become an old dog that doesn't want to learn a new trick."

  body: Jackie, Never had any of those problems with InDesign - might try reinstalling
    the program, or could be a third party plug-in conflict. Tony, The Quark Version
    is way newer than the InDesign one - that might be the issue - back when I was
    on CS1 and Quark 4 you could open Quark files in InDesign.

    does not seem to have upgraded its ability to import Quark files, which is very
    frustrating. It was enormously helpful to me when I was learning InD that I could
    open Quark files into it. But alas no more.\r\n\r\nI have never known Quark to
    be able to import InDesign files. And Jackie, I haven't had your sorts of problems
    with InDesign either. I have my own gripes with InD (lack of kerning tables, the
    fact that there is no key command for Text Frame Options as Quark has, the completely
    retarded Links pane - why do you have to manually update each image when they
    are all in the same folder???)"

  body: "Thanks Ricardo -\r\n\r\nAs the production side of my brain says \"get the
    job out now\" I always look for the route around - may not be the fastest -- but
    it gets the job out. Then I'll, if I get the breather, reinstall.\r\n\r\nIn the
    case of InDesign - I'm still on CS1 because I cannot justify spending money to
    upgrade. The client that insists I use it -- has now found a new bone to pick...
    I wrote about it here earlier. Seems no one has noticed a \"trapping\" problem.
    I just received a printed proof -- I hadn't a clue what they were talking about
    -- then hubby pulled out a loupe to show me. He also commented, \"Do they give
    a loupe to every person who buys a book from this series.\"\r\n\r\nSo first they
    picked on me to get InDesign, and now I think they are picking on me to give the
    work to the printer. Just my regular NY paranoia...\r\n\r\nand Ricardo, you should
    see me pick apart the RGB PDFs that come in for reproduction -- fun fun!"

    too. If there are a lot of images to update which live in the same folder, what
    I usually do is update one of them, save the document, and close it. All the remaining
    links will be automatically updated once the document is reopened."

    talking about. That is, I vaguely recall some inconvenient behaviour in the past.
    But with ID CS3 (v5; on OSX.5), I haven\u2019t experienced such problems:\r\nWhen
    the .indd-document resides in the same folder as the linked files, I can move
    the folder and won\u2019t have to update any broken links. When the .indd sits
    somewhere else and I have moved/renamed the links folder, I have to update merely
    <em>one</em> link. The rest is fixed automatically. I don\u2019t know how you
    can improve on that.\r\n\r\n<cite>the fact that there is no key command for Text
    Frame Options as Quark has</cite>\r\n\r\nWhat can you do via these Quark Text
    Frame Options? Just curious.\r\nF"

  body: "Miguel, that's a good tip, thanks.\r\n\r\nFlorian, maybe what you're talking
    about is a feature of CS 3 which I have yet to install. I will be installing it
    soon tho, just ordered a new MacBook Pro! Quark's equivalent of Text Frame Options
    is called Modify and it's essentially the same thing, but accessible by a simple
    command + M, rather than going to a drop down.\r\n\r\nPaul - command B doesn't
    give me the window I want. I am talking about the window \"Text Frame Options\"
    under Object. The pane that lets you make columns or center text in a window -
    or ignore text wrap. But yes, I do use the Quark key commands - that's the only
    way I can work in InD. I used Quark for about 15 years before I learned InD and
    trying to un-learn it would have been a nightmare."

  body: "To import an InDesign file into an older version of InDesign, you must first
    EXPORT it to the INDESIGN INTERCHANGE format. This might also help resolve PC
    to Mac issues, although I have not tried it. Of course, any new functions not
    supported in the older version will be disabled and might mess up your files in
    surprising ways. \r\nIn my opinion, InDesign CS3 is worth the money. It handles
    transparency much better. If you are still working with Illustrator CS, an upgrade
    to the new Creative Suite 3 will give you some amazing new color tools.\r\n\r\nI
    was a Quark user for many years too, but have happily made the switch.\r\n\r\n"

    only used the Quark to InDesign plugin in both CS2 & CS3 (Quark 6 originals),
    saved a lot of time on a certain project which out weighed the cost. Imports all
    style sheets, guides etc. As usual remember that nothing is perfect, you'll definitely
    have to watch out for any manual kerning and double check that all styles sheets
    are working as intended. At the end of the day a lot quicker than recreating multiple
    documents.\r\n\r\nHope it helps."
