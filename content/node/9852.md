  typography. I don&#39;t know if this sort of thing will annoy you &#40;or just be
  ignored&#41; and I apologize in advance if it does.  <BR>I am redesigning a hospital
  consent form for one of my classes. I really want to do an excellent job, but am
  having problems choosing a font for it. Right now I am using Optima and Minion Pro.
  It needs to be exquisitely legible, while at the same time non-threatening and comforting.
  I would be so grateful for any ideas.<!--attachment: strongconsentweb-67733.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*75.6*Redesigned+Consent+form+for+Hospital*strongconsentweb%2epdf

  body: The fonts work okay for a medical form but I think you have a design problem
    with your rules.  <BR> <BR>You&#39;re trying to use the rules as field for intials
    and as a divider between sections. It&#39;s confusing and makes the seperation
    feel uncomfortable. A quick fix would be to increase the spacing above each section,
    between the type and the extra wide rules. Also, the spacing between the rules
    and type above them is too much, and it&#39;s applied inconsistantly. The space
    below &#34;Relationship to Guardian&#34; feels good, try using that for everything.

    I think that&#39;s asking for the impossible. ;o&#41;'

  body: The lines which separate the the varied procedures need to be different than
    the lines which are used for writing. Also, the marker used to designate Initial
    location seems a little vague.

  body: I agree with the others. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;d move the main body of info
    away from the top block of info on the front page. One more unit down, where a
    unit equals the space between two rules. &#39;Initial&#39; gets kind of lost over
    there on the far right. <BR> <BR>It might not hurt to repeat &#39;initial&#39;
    in grey or a lighter weight, they way &#39;date&#39; is repeated on the back.
    It&#39;s just less ambiguous.
