  very common to see this slightly tall sans serif typeface like in this posters here:\r\nhttp://rodrigocastellari.com/Leica\r\n\r\nDo
  you guys by any chance know this one?\r\nCould you also please recommend me a couple
  of variations in the same style?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nRonaldo."

      you pay attention to the capital i (I) you'll see that it's not just the bar
      in vertical. It has the vertical bar and 2 horizontal.\r\nAny ideas?\r\nCheers."

  body: "Sorry Ronaldo, thought you wanted MONOCHROM - small type is hard to pin down.
    Nike font is close but not it\r\nMonofonto from Dafont/Typodermic is also close
    but \"&\" is wrong"
