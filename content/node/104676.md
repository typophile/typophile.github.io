  body: "All I can say for sure is that it\u2019s a Garamond. But there are many many
    Garamonds out there. And the size of your sample certainly doesn\u2019t make it
    easy to identify. I wouldn\u2019t call any Garamond a simple font btw. All that
    being said I\u2019d guess it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/garamond/\">Monotype
    Garamond</a>."
