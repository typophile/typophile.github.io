  body: "These are not \"typefaces\" as such, but medium-dependent alphabets, which
    means they were specifically created for road signs and are unavailable for any
    other application.\r\n\r\nThere <em>is</em> a slight possibility though that somebody
    digitised this, but I wouldn't know. BTW These are the ugliest signage alphabets
    bar none I know of."

  body: "Exactly. I have to look at them every day! Then I saw them in Switzerland.
    But these were much better. The Belgian signs are old, they've been here for about
    30 years or so. The Swiss are much more recent. They also have created different
    weights. The Swiss probably finetuned this old Belgian typeface, who knows...
    \r\n\r\nBut it's not because they look ugly that they are less interesting. And
    I'm intrigued by the flat 'a'.\r\n\r\nDoes someone know the name or history or
    do you know a link or lead to the solution? Please help, it's killing me!"

      typeface for signs in the countries of the former people's republic of Yugoslavia.
      \r\n\r\nI also know that M. Olyff made a pretty good alternative somewhere in
      the seventies, but that it was never applied. "

      body: 'I see the Belgians are not too fond of there roads, have you seen the
        Ring lately?. It''s not the font that is crap, I guess. It''s the use of it.
        I must say, fellow countriemen, the same font was used very nicely in Switzerland.
        I think you can find this typeface on old playingcards (80''s), made by Carta
        Mundi, here in Belgium. '

  body: I think most of these are based on the German DIN (original! - digitzed as
    Engschrift, Mittelschrift and so on) that has been upgraded/adapted so well by
    Albert Pool.
