body: "So, deriving from the topic here - http://typophile.com/node/16879 - what is
  the general feeling on using stylistic sets to accomplish some of what presently
  can't be done with existing OpenType features (but some \"crazy\" people might want
  to do anyways) ? Lets say I want to make supersuperiors or a petite lowercase or
  special size and aligment just for end/footnotes, special form for captioning images,
  etc? The immediate problem from the user POV is that the same set from two different
  foundries or even fonts need not mean the same thing and there is no sensible way
  to memorize what which does. If the feature is used before registration, there is
  no real guarantee that it would be registered or registered with the same name thus
  creating a fairly dangerous minefield. \r\n\r\nOr should one always propose and
  register[1] a new OpenType feature for it and then wait with releasing? Never mind
  that as no app would support[2] it at the very least until a new version is out
  (even if then) so users couldn't use it? Or is there a good middle ground? \r\n\r\n[1]
  However that is done, and if there will really be an ISO standard, I can imagine
  it will be the standard \"please come back with a truckful of documentation in time
  for the standards next revision in 5 years\"?\r\n\r\n[2] OK, so so far even support
  for stylistic sets is rather thin\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think the Stylistic Sets features would be entirely appropriate for something
    like 'a petite lowercase'. This is exactly the sort of thing the features were
    designed for.\r\n\r\nI think using them for something like specially tailored
    superiors for e.g. footnotes as opposed to ordinals, would also be appropriate
    and not at all a hack, so long as you implement the features so that the stylistic
    set feature is used in conjunction with the superiors feature. So you wouldn't
    use e.g. 'ss01' to map regular numerals to your special superior numerals, you
    would use it to map the superior numerals resulting from the 'sups' feature to
    those special, stylistic forms. This is entirely legitimate, because what you
    are doing is applying stylistic variants of superior letters.\r\n\r\nCross-font
    compatibility is always going to be a problem for anything involving stylistic
    substitutions, and there is no way around this. Ideally, applications should have
    the option to automatically turn off stylistic set layout tags when you switch
    fonts out of a particular family."

  body: "I can't think of a case where \"ss01\"-\"ss20\" could be hacked. These features
    are intended to be \"non-semantic\" i.e. they do not impose a particular functionality
    of the glyphs. You can essentially put any variants you want to them. On several
    occasions, I have made them work together with other features, e.g. smcp or onum.

    hacking a stylistic set feature would involve using one to impose a semantic distinction,
    but that is true of pretty much any GSUB feature. The kind of example that comes
    to mind is using s stylistic feature to substitute a semantically meaningful variant
    that is not a true variant of the underlying character code. For example, in some
    Greek typesetting certain letters might be printed upsidedown, and this is semantically
    meaningful because it indicates a distinct pronunciation, and these forms really
    should have their own Unicode codepoints and be encoded in the text string. But
    because they are not (yet) in Unicode, some intrepid font developer might decide
    to treat them as stylistic variants of the regular letters. I would consider this
    to be a hack."
