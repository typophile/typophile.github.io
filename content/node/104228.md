body: 'This seems to be some sort of Garamond with oldstyle figures, but I can''t
  figure out which one: the upper part of the "f" is quite narrow, the italic "f"
  doesn''t fit at all, the leg of the  "K" seems to have only one serif, the bar of
  the number "5" is too horizontal,  its lower part seems too rounded... or am I mistaken
  and it''s not Garamond at all? Any help would be greatly appreciated![img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_5086.jpg]'
