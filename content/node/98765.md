body: Hi, this is a scanned page from Isaac Ware's 1738 translation of Palladio's
  Four Books on Architecture . I'm sorry for the low quality, I have pictures with
  higher quality but the file size is huge, and the book itself has deteriorated somewhat.
  The typography is beautiful so I was planning on reproducing some of this stuff
  with LaTeX. It would be great if someone can ID the font for me. Thanks!

    Caslon. \r\n\r\nIf a comparison doesn't verify that, upload just one paragraph
    from your high resolution copy; that should be small enough and would be a big
    help."

    as the reproduction in LaTeX using Adobe Caslon Pro. I'm pretty sure it's the
    right font but would just like a confirmation. Thanks.\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/Vi6Vf\r\nhttp://imgur.com/nblev"

    body: The Adobe Caslon would be a great choice because it is a well-done interpretation
      of Caslon's original work.

  body: What I meant was can you confirm the book was indeed typeset in Caslon from
    the higher resolution picture I uploaded? Thanks.

    body: While not a great many glyphs to compare to, from what I see I am virtually
      sure it is Caslon.
