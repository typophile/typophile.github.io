  really found what I&#39;m looking for ... <BR> <BR>I need something that approximates
  a hi-res dot-matrix display, something like in this image of the MorganStanley stock
  ticker from Times Square. <BR> <BR>Doesn&#39;t need to have the &#39;pixels&#39;
  separate if you know what I mean -- just a nice, fairly functional-looking bitmap.

  body: Thanks Mike, <BR> <BR>Gateway and Luggagetag are both nice, but just not quite
    there. DaFont also didn&#39;t have anything I hadn&#39;t already seen. It&#39;s
    for a logotype, so I&#39;m making my own letters, but I was looking for some inspiration
    as I haven&#39;t made this type of letter before &#40;the R and N are a pig to
    get looking right ...&#41;. I think I&#39;m getting it working now though. <BR>

  body: Robert -- there are ways to emulate the stock <BR>ticker look using some photoshop
    and <BR>an existing font  ... <BR>you get something like this ... it could <BR>be
    tweaked more ... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/39157.jpg"

    <BR> <BR>in category <BR>http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=302&amp;page=1 <BR>
    <BR>I could find several that could match your descriptions, like: <BR>Big Dots
    <BR>DS-point <BR>High Speed <BR>MK Zodnig square <BR>Nokian <BR> <BR>&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: 'Chesh: Looked at those already, but ta anyways. <BR> <BR>bj: I&#39;m OK with
    the emulation bit &#40;working on a grid in Illustrator and then scaling each
    grid square is my way at the moment&#41;. <BR> <BR>Jan: I obviously wasn&#39;t
    looking hard enough at DaFont. Some of those look useful. I think I&#39;m still
    going to go with custom letters but these are at least a bit out of the mainstream.
    <a href="http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=302&amp;page=1" target="_blank">BigDots</a>
    and <a href="http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=302&amp;page=3" target="_blank">DS
    Point</a> are definitely in the right area. <BR> <BR>Thanks guys, very helpful
    as usual. <BR> <BR>R'
