body: I would like to learn how to letter by hand, the old fashioned way. I checked
  to see if there were any threads previously, and didn't have much luck with my search.
  My main question is what kind of pen I should choose. Things will start of real
  basic, and I would like to learn how to use both the broad nib and round hand styles.
  Any suggestions?

    use all of the nibs eventually.

    wouldn't scrimp on the pen, it really can make a difference, however the best
    way to find one that is good for you is to try them \u2013\_obviously expensive,
    my search led me to these two, Rotring sketch pens and Pilot parallel, I find
    they clog up less than any others and produce predictable consistent line widths,
    allowing one to concentrate on the lettering. On the other hand there is a lot
    to be said for the marks that dip pens and brushes make.\r\n\r\nTim"

    Brause broad-nib pens :  we were told that they were stiffer than other brands,
    therefore they were easier to handle for beginners, since they move slower onto
    the paper. We used coarse papers for the same reason : to slow down our not-so-assured
    hand moves in order to control them better.'

  body: Thanks for all the advice. There is a local shop here that literally has thousands
    of pens, so I might go in and try a few out, just to see how they feel in my hand.
    Generally, I like a heavier pen, something that makes me feel like I have something
    in my hand, and a nib which doesn't make it feel as though I am cutting into the
    paper. These are the problems I have often had with pens I have used in the past,
    but this could be due to poor technique, rather then poor equipment as well.

    body: "If you would really like to learn the old-fashioned way, you certainly
      can't go wrong with some Brause or HB (Heintze & Blankertz if I am remembering
      the spelling) dip pens and a holder from someone like Koh-i-noor. Fit yourself
      out with a range from 3/4 mm up to 2mm or even 5mm and go to town. These pens
      work really well with ink, and you can also feed gouache into them by touching
      the tip of a loaded brush to the edge of the reservoir. In my experience, they
      are in a completely different class from the Speedball nibs sold widely in the
      U.S. (I forgot to look to see where you are located.)\r\n\r\nUse these nibs
      with some quadrille paper and you can have a great time.  The quadrille paper
      saves the tedium of ruling guidelines and if you can find some ruled in metric,
      so much the better.\r\n\r\nThen pick up a nice used fountain pen with an edged
      nib, as long as it flows well. I struggled for years trying to get Platignum
      pens to work smoothly and flow-ily and never succeeded, but there are other
      (more expensive) brands that work very nicely. I had a Pelikan at one point
      with an edged nib that was pretty nice. You're right, though, about that feeling
      of the nib cutting into the paper. For this reason, i just use a fountain pen
      with a round nib and leave the edged-pen stuff to dip pens.\r\n\r\nIf you find
      a decent fountain pen you can carry around it in your pocket as you move through
      the world, and have the pleasure of making letters with it, but at home you
      have the ideal setup with your Brause nibs and some good black ink. Oh, and
      don't use India ink -- use good quality fountain pen ink (India almost always
      too thick!)\r\n\r\nIf you haven't picked on up already, a good book is a big
      plus. I recommend Edward Johnston's \"Writing and Illuminating and Lettering\"
      and Friedrich Neugebauer's \"The Mystic Art of Written Forms.\" I think Johnston
      is perpetually in print; Neugebauer is not in print but can be found used. (Important
      disclosure: I translated Friedrich's book from German into English back in 1980.
      Hope no one feels it is inappropriate for me to plug the book here -- my own
      involvement aside, I still feel it is the best calligraphy text ever written.)\r\n\r\nhth,\r\n\r\nBruce "
