  body: "I'm not trying to start a debate or anything, but I'm curious as to how the
    list of typefaces was chosen? I was kind of surprised to see that of the three
    Adobe Originals in the set, two of them were Blackoak and Wood Type Ornaments....
    Eldorado, Monterey and Vineta were also unexpected (to me).\r\n\r\nAlso, some
    typefaces listed are classics that have been revived in often radically different
    versions, such as Bodoni, Caslon, and Garamond. Are we to assume that the different
    cuts are interchangeable for purposes of this book? \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: There is an extension on the deadline for valued Typophiles :) We have had
    a dearth of submissions for Helvetica, Avant Garde, and a few other extremely
    popular typefaces. Still looking for quality submissions for many of the fonts.
    Please feel free to submit ASAP if you want to participate.

  body: "To answer Tom - some of the typefaces listed were from the original publisher's
    spec. There will be some adjustments, depending on the quality of work we get
    in for all the listed typefaces. I know some of the choices might seem out of
    the norm, but they were chosen based on trying to get a well rounded overview
    of classic types, with a few modern \"classics\" worked into the mix.\r\n\r\nMultiple
    cuts will be illustrated to show designers how different some variants are that
    are sold under the same or similar names."
