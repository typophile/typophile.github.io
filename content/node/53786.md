  do a work for my type class.\r\nThe project is an exposition\xB4s catalog  about
  typefaces and typographers of 20th century.\r\nThat\xB4s the general topic, but
  we have to close that and I would like to talk about type anachronism in films.
  I\xB4ve read Mark Simonson\xB4s text and I think it can be a great work, but I need
  some help and that\xB4s because I\xB4m here.\r\n\r\nI suppose that some of you have
  seen some films that are fine or wrong (typographicly talking, of course) and I
  would like to know your opinion.\r\n\r\nThanks to everybody who can help!!! And
  I hope I\xB4m been clear and my English wasn\xB4t too bad.\r\n\r\nM\xF3nica\r\n\r\n"

    type anachronism.\r\nJust in the first minutes you see a geography lection by
    Aristoteles with the country names set in english... Ridiculous and kitsch: the
    final demonstration of American (or post-modern Western) vulgarity.\r\n\r\nAt
    the contrary, you perhaphs remember a 80' tv cartoon about Cervantes \"Don Quichote\",
    with a marvellous animation of the Cervantes sign at the beginning.\r\n\r\nbye\r\ncarlo"
