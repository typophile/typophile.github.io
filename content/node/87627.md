  body: That's just Dana Tanamachi being amazing. I'm sure her scripts are based on
    existing formal scripts, you could find the influence anywhere.

    it is based on. It's even currently used on myfonts.com in the main banner image
    spelling 'The' but I can't locate the font on their site either:\r\n\r\nhttp://cdn.myfonts.net/s/aw/720x360/64/0/33047.jpg"

    the font I was thinking about, it's got some similarities, but obviously different:

  body: "Being a competitor of Dana's I've researched this font as it's one of her
    most used.  I actually make an effort not to use so I don't get my work confused
    with hers.  You can almost pull the entire alphabet of it from all of her different
    sample images.  Most notable are the S and the Q and the lower case x, they are
    dead on ENGRAVER'S SCRIPT.  The rest of this main script font she uses so often
    is her take on engraver's script as well.  While I don't think there is an exact
    font called that, I find it often in my old typography and lettering books, it's
    plate 25 of 60 Alphabets by the Hunt Brothers, 4th printing. \r\n\r\nYou can find
    several similar fonts by looking up copperplate script fonts:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/copperplate_scripts/\r\n\r\nShe
    draws it single line and then comes back and thickens up all of the downward strokes.
    \ Then she drops in a shadow line, normally to the bottom right.  If you want
    a quick trick for getting the shadow line right draw your letters out first.  Then
    tape two pieces of chalk together, hold them in your hand at a 45* angle facing
    down and to the right, then trace over the right side portions of the letters
    lightly.  Then go back and darken your new line, skipping parts that overlap.
    \ You will also find that to make the letters pop she ads a shadow when a line
    in a letter overlaps.  She's just erasing right beneath the overlapping line.\r\n\r\nSorry
    I found this so late.  In the future I may put up a free font on my website based
    on this style, as it's so popular.  "
