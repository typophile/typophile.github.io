body: I've noticed that recently, a lot of these kinds of typefaces have been showing
  up here and there. It's perfect for one of my projects for school, can anyone help
  identify this typeface? or even better, hit me with some names of typefaces that
  are in this style? Thanks a bunch!

    the typefaces are just customized versions of other typefaces (mostly adding a
    stroke and some fine tuning).\r\n\r\nHere's a few links to some fatsies: \r\nhttp://www.qbn.com/topics/557254/\r\nhttp://www.tylorjreimer.com/blog/resources/geometric-fonts/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/tags/fat/\r\n\r\nDingfatz
    is, by far, my favourite!"
