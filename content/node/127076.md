  Guessing it may have been a display font by sign maker? Would love to find something
  close as a jumping off point. Thanks for your help!"

    signs of this nature and vintage were often hand-painted, not typeset. \r\n\r\nCould
    you provide a date and a location for the image (was, or is, this train station
    in England or the US, for example)?\r\n\r\nAt least then I could consult some
    type specimen catalogues from the correct era and part of the world and give some
    historically accurate suggestions."
