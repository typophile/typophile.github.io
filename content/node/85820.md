body: "Hello, all.\r\n\r\nI acquainted myself with font production the weekend before
  last and constructed a typeface for a piece of fiction I'm working on in OpenType
  format using the tool FontForge.\r\n\r\nIt's a fictional flowing script which is
  generally meant to be written in a bottom-to-top fashion.  A given syllable tends
  to be continuous along a centerline, starting with a consonant sound or hard-start
  mark, and each character maps one-to-one to a phoneme.\r\n\r\nMy biggest headache
  with implementing this at present is alignment issues which occur under windows.
  \ I heard about a negative-space hinting mechanism used for keeping the gap-pairs
  in lowercase Ms and Ws continuous, and given the characters this occurs most with
  (they map to 'a', 'o' and 'm') I'm guessing it's the culprit.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n<img

  my main worries.  The yellow box highlights a lesser alignment issue.  Note that
  this was rendered with notepad32 and rotated.  The properly-aligned versions of
  the problem letters are initial forms joined to the hard-start glyph.\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://evanbalster.com/wreath/font-test.html\">Here's</a> a webpage where
  the font can be experimented with.  Combining marks (like 'Th', 'Thh', 'Zh', 'Sh',
  'Ch') don't seem to work except under Firefox/Windows and so must be entered with
  the number keys, Q and X.\r\n\r\nA second caveat:  I'm fine with ligatures being
  defunct in most browsers, but I've found Microsoft Word doesn't properly adjust
  character width when two characters combine.  (Something like Thh will leave a gap
  as though the glyphs weren't replaced.)  Hence I need to use the direct mappings
  (number keys, Q and X) to type them properly."
