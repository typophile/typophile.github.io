body: "According to the British Standards 2961:1967 Typeface Classification the Lineale
  Grotesque are \u201Ctype faces with nineteenth-century origins. There is some contrast
  in thickness of strokes. They have squareness of curve, and curling close-set jaws.
  The R usually has a curled leg and the G is spurred. The ends of the curved strokes
  are usually horizontal.\u201D\r\nThe examples given are: SB Grotesque No. 6, Condensed
  Sans No. 7, Headline. Does anyone know where I can find high resolution scans or
  specimens of these three typefaces? Also I would like to have a few more examples
  of \u2018Lineale Grotesque\u2019.\r\nAccording to Mitja Miklavcic dissertation \u2018Neo-Grotesque
  Sans Serifs of the 1950s and the 1960s: \u201CThe British Standards 2961:1967 Typeface
  Classification suggests that the grotesque faces have the ends of the curved strokes
  cut horizontally, while the neo-grotesques are cut oblique \u2013 usually it\u2019s
  the opposite.\u201D Does anyone have any views about that?\r\n"
