  I don't believe Font Vista nor Font Book is the answer I'm seeking. I think they
  would do well, though, to implement this format into their Apps..\r\n Basically,
  I'm looking for a font speciman page layout app. that will just print out the fonts
  by name alphabetically IN THE FONT STYLE itself; much like the way Illustrator previews
  it's font list. I don't want the a-z/1-10 options- just the name of the font in
  its style. Takes up musch less paper, easier to scroll through, and if you see the
  font name in its style it makes it easier to recall that font. Anyone feel me on
  that one? Does anyone have a lead THANKS!!!"

    fonts in your library, the $99 invested in [[FontBook]] could be worth the considerable
    effort that would be involved in printing a large font catalog. \r\n\r\nBenefit:
    an organized, cross-referenced, hardcover archive of thousands of available fonts.\r\n\r\nDrawback:
    FontBook doesn't have everything. You would miss a few commercial collections
    and free fonts. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I was involved in the production of FontBook."

  body: "I use High-Logic's <a href=http://www.high-logic.com/maintype.html>MainType</a>
    for my font management (since the options on Windows are pretty slim). MainType
    does just what you want, allowing you to export either a Rich Text File or Web
    Page with whatever info on the selected fonts you want, set in the fonts themselves.
    Unfortunately, it's PC-only, so someone might be able to recommend a Mac solution.
    If you have a PC, you can download the demo and create custom specimen books to
    your heart's content.\r\n\r\nI second Stephen's suggestion of FontBook; I just
    got it, and I'm thrilled. But it is signicantly big, both in cost and physi cal
    size."

    it\u2019s too much. My only (somewhat minor) grievance is the US price of $99
    in comparison with the European price of \u20AC99 (c. $130). I\u2019m sure there\u2019s
    a very logical and commercial reason.\r\n\r\n<em>\u2026and physical size.</em>\r\n\r\nTo

    I've just made an interesting web page version here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontspace.com/lab/specimen/generator.htm\r\n\r\nIt
    works on windows IE+Firefox, and I believe it should on a Mac too .. and you don't
    even need to install anything.\r\n\r\nI just printed out all my installed fonts
    and it looked pretty good.  Let me know if there's any features you want if you
    find it useful."

  body: "Visualize: That's handy. Might just thrash that through the printer here
    and thus save myself and my wife a ton of time indexing fonts...! Interesting.
    Just tried it out and I'm not sure why, but it only indexed about 2/3ds of my
    fonts. The other ones printed out as plain TimesNewRoman rather than their actual
    font. Hm.\r\n\r\nMaybe a busted font registry on my end? I dunno. The fonts that
    don't work with this site all work for me in WordPerfect, OpenOffice, etc...\r\n\r\nCuriouser
    and curiouser. I tried it in IE and it works perfectly. Only blows up in FF."
