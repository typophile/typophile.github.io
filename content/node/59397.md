  body: "Is this a photo from a TV screen? It's hard to see enough detail to notice
    if there are differences in identical letters. You may not find something with
    the white 'shadow', but that is just done by offsetting the identical white lettering
    underneath the black letters. There are at least two sans styles in this sample,
    and you may find them by searching for \"weighted sans\", since the stroke weights
    are uneven.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
