    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t like the color combo, but the caps/lc combo at the <BR>same
    weight works well. It&#39;s a decent logo, Kyle. Good job.

  body: I was so excited about that, being that the bolder weight and the regular
    weight matched nearly perfectly at that size combination. <BR> <BR>On colors,
    well, maybe not, I can&#39;t say its for everyone, but its a combination I have
    been dying to use on something, and a &#34;free&#34; project seemed the best bet.
    <BR> <BR>Ohh and you don&#39;t count for the font guessing <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
