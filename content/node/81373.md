body: "Can anyone suggest why the OpenTypes I'm generating in Fontographer 5 have
  sporadic spacing anomalies and the tracking occasionally goes way out. It looks
  like I've gone insane while kerning. This weirdness is only happening in .otf font
  files; the .ttf , Mac PostScript and Mac TrueTypes are all exactly as designed.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/otf_generated_by_Fog5_5070.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
  I take my Fontographer-generated .ttf file into FontLab and generate .otf files,
  they have the correct spacing, the problem is only in  Fontographer generated OpenTypes.
  Am I doing something stupid or has Fontographer 5 got a glitch?\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance."

  body: "Yes, I think you're right Nick, in the event of such a major faux pas I think
    owners should have received an urgent email.\r\nThe fixed version is on the way,
    Fontlab Sales emailed me yesterday, \"we expect Fontographer 5.1 in early May\",
    I trust this will be a free update.\r\n\r\nI don't want to be too negative because
    I still feel grateful to FontLab for breathing life back into Fontographer, especially
    in the face of criticism that their engineers would have been better employed
    updating FontLab. I read one comment here on Typophile which described Fontographer
    as a 'children's toy', I can't believe how some people totally miss the point
    about creating a tool for the graphic and type designer who doesn't aspire to
    become a font engineer."

  body: "We're sorry for this bug. Since in .otf fonts kerning is an OpenType Layout
    feature, and the support for adding OpenType Layout features was completely new
    in Fontographer, we made some mistakes in implementing in in Fontographer 5.0.
    \r\n\r\nFOG 5.1 is pretty much done and is in the last phase of beta testing.
    It'll be a free update for all FOG 5.0 users. "

    tool for BUILDING a font, while FontLab excels at FINISHING a font...which is
    not to say that both products couldn't be improved, but FOG5 is a valuable tool
    in the hands of a person who knows how to use it."

  body: "Fontographer is a very solid tool. Even if you want to make high-end complex
    font, you can add Microsoft VTT for hinting and Microsoft VOLT for OpenType Layout
    features, and use Fontographer to produce a very solid font that is then processed
    with those Microsoft tools. \r\n\r\nPerhaps somebody may confuse \"simple\" with
    \"simplistic\". To me, \"simple\" is a great virtue. Basically, you cannot build
    a \"bad\" font with FOG 5 (except for the few bugs, of course, which blur the
    picture). The user interface is solid, the drawing tools are solid, the underlying
    technology (thanks to the FontLab engine under the hood) is also very solid. \r\n\r\nI
    think this kind of reflects the current trend in other areas. A micro-four-thirds
    Lumix GH2 camera may be some considered a \"children's toy\", but some professionals
    actually use it to shoot films and music videos. Apple's GarageBand or iMovie
    aren't really \"children's toys\" either. Sure, there is the final 2% of finesse
    for which you may end other tools (conveniently, the free Microsoft come in handy
    as a complement for FOG). But with Fontographer, it's certainly very easy to start
    with just your drawing skills, and get a professional result. It's, essentially,
    only the skills that make the difference. A tool like Fontographer, is almost
    \"transparent\". It exposes the designer's skills, bare-bones. \r\n\r\n(Matthew
    Carter still uses Fontgrapher to design his fonts, as an example.)\r\n"
