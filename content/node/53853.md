  is the latest documentary from director/producer Gary Hustwit (<a href=\"http://www.helveticafilm.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\"><i>Helvetica</i></a>). The film, which investigates the field
  of industrial design, is set to premier in March at Austin's South by Southwest
  Film Festival (with preview screenings in San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and
  London TBA). As with <i>Helvetica</i> before it, <i>Objectified</i> has its very
  own website with blog, shop, and most recently, trailer. With all these different
  features have come three very different type treatments for the film's title.\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Objectified2.png\"/>\r\n\r\nThe first is a modified
  Helvetica Ultra Compressed in two shades of green used for the masthead of the website,
  designed by <a href=\"http://jasonsantamaria.com/portfolio/objectified/\" target=\"_blank\">Jason
  Santa Maria</a>.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Objectified1.png\"/>\r\n\r\nThe
  second is an \"objects logo\" constructed from letterforms of iconic product silhouettes
  (Ive\u2019s click wheel for Apple, Rams\u2019 pocket radio for Braun, etc.) designed
  by <a href=\"http://www.wearebuild.com/blog/2008/11/whats-in-a-logo/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael
  C. Place</a> of Build. The logo is used on T-shirts and posters in the online store.\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Objectified3.png\"/>\r\n\r\nFinally there are the
  titles from the trailer set in gray on gray Akzidenz Grotesk, presumably by Hustwit
  himself. View the trailer below:\r\n<object width=\"590\" height=\"355\"><param
  name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/S9E2D2PaIcI&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\"></param><param
  name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/S9E2D2PaIcI&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&feature=player_embedded&fs=1\"
  type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"590\" height=\"355\"></embed></object>\r\n\r\nAll
  this conflicting branding seems a little strange to me. Why the inconsistency? Which
  is your favorite?"
