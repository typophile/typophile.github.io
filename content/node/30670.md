    body: "<cite> The is one of my favorite underused alternatives </cite>\r\n\r\nTotally
      agree with you there Stephen, I used it only recently. But since you mention
      Nick's Brown Gothic, do you know if Toyota have taken this typeface under their
      wings and started to incorporate it into their advertising of late or is it
      a typeface that has just sneaked in under the radar and is being used ad-lib
      by a particular Irish ad agency?"

  body: I will keep an eye out for an example stephen, I did not keep a representative
    sample - It was only when you mentioned Nick's typeface that I remembered where
    I have spotted it before
