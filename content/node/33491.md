  title=\"Compose to a Vertical Rhythm\">designers</a> have worked hard to do the

  of the best of the web typefaces. Sure they're just Georgia and Verdana, but when
  used well as they are here, they add real sophistication to a design.\r\n\r\n<a

  Subtraction</a> proves that type can look great on the web if used properly. Here
  a single font (Arial) is leveraged to its full potential with the aid of a strong
  underlying grid layout.\r\n\r\nWhat sites inspire you to use type better on the
  web?"

    Arial listed first, at least at the root level:\r\n<code>html, body {font-family:
    arial, helvetica, sans-serif;</code>"

    and <a href=\"http://www.simplebits.com/\">SimpleBits</a>. In the latter, the
    use of Goudy Old Style for the ampersand (yes, it's not an image), it's simply
    genius.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.iconbuffet.com/\">IconBuffet</a> used to be
    one of my favorites, when they were using Helvetica."
