  body: Can't find a match but don't think it's a font, rather a custom lettering
    for the movie. My suggestion would be to start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova|Mostra
    Nuova]] mixing Heavy and Heavy Alternate C to get a closer /C. But that would
    let a lot of work...

  body: "Good find Kevin. FF Turmino Black has fairly close proportions and weight
    to the DELICATESSEN letters. Here it is with the changes you mentioned plus other
    tinkering.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TurminoBlackEditedSM_5130.jpg] This
    is not very difficult to replicate. \r\nDon"

    body: "Nice work, Don.\r\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised to find Turmino Black.
      The original title was hand drawn, and was based on old German advertising posters
      of the 1910s and 1920s."
