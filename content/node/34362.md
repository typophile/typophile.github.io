  a video aboutGeorgia  font, but I don't have enough info about it.\r\nI'm searching
  the web, but find more info about Carter and poor articles about Georgia, asking
  to teachers but they told me always the same short infos:\r\n\r\n\"It's one of the
  best serif screen type,designed by Mr. Matthew Carter for MS after long studies
  and experiments about screen res.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you help me with info and good

  body: As far as I remember Carters 'Miller' is very related to Georgia. I don't
    know which came first, but I suspect that there is more info on Miller laying
    around.

  body: "Great topic! Maybe one day you can make it into\r\nsomething as famous as
    the Helvetica movie!  :-)\r\n\r\nHere's one thing - an interesting old interview:\r\nhttp://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of history, like Claus says it's related to Miller,\r\nand they're both
    what's called \"Scotch\" type - you might\r\nlike to read up on that in chapter
    21 of A Lawson's classic\r\n\"Anatomy of a Typeface\".\r\n\r\nAnd if you have
    the time/patience to sift through a great deal of\r\nwriting you might find some
    interesting things here on Typophile,\r\nbut use Google's search, like this: \"site:typophile.com
    georgia\"\r\n\r\nLastly, a big part of Georgia's essence is of course related
    to its\r\non-screen quality, so you might do some research into bitmap\r\nfonts,
    hinting, etc. not least by searching Typophile, but also\r\nvia Microsoft's superb
    type section:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/default.mspx\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    che scrivi su questo forum, non presentarti con \"hi guys\" e in minuscolo. Poi
    controlla gli spazi (mi riferisco a \"aboutGeorgia\", \"type,designed\", \"title..anybody\").

  body: "In regard to Georgia/Miller.\r\n\r\nI think Georgia was commissioned by Microsoft
    in TrueType format in the early-1990s. I know Miller (which is somewhat identical,
    in regard to basic letterforms) was not available then. I think in 1995 or 1996,
    I had asked Matthew if he had a PS1 Mac/PC convertible roman with a companion
    Greek (there was nothing available at the time) and he said he had the beta Miller
    and Wilson Greek but they were not sized to each other and Miller did not have
    an italic at that point. What I needed was a full roman and italic (with all Latin
    forms and characters that had been used by the Aldines\u2014including arcane incunabular)
    and a Greek. Carter bit the bullet and provided the needed typeface/s as Manutius,
    which was later commercially available as Miller and Wilson Greek (without all
    the alternate characters). Manutius was decommissioned with the completion of
    the project in 2000/01. As I recall Carter ran most of it through Font Bureau.\r\n\r\nI
    think Manutius is referenced in Typographically Speaking or some other recent
    issue devoted to Matthew but I have not otherwise seen mention of it.\r\n\r\nWith
    Matthew's permission though, I wrote an article on it for Printing History (Journal
    of the American Printing History Association). Includes some typographic specimen
    showings of the book project, The Aldine Press.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\nThe Bieler

  body: "You might want to look into this... \r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=5819\r\n\r\nSome
    chaps at a gallery/studio in Seattle, wanted to do some kind of font exhibit during
    TypeCon and I suggested that Matthew's Microsoft work might make for a good subject.
    When I contacted Matthew he noted that there's very little source material, drawings
    etc., for these fonts and that there\u2019s a lot of misinformation about them
    floating around out there. He thought telling the story of these fonts might set
    the record straight, so a possible approach they\u2019re looking at is interviews
    with the people involved, along with visuals of the fonts themselves. We\u2019re
    also keeping John Berry in the loop, re. a possible book or article related to
    this.  \r\n"
