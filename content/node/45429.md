  a few roughs to them (attached below). They like the idea, but want a more mature
  look for their rock n' roll image, as they've recently changed the name (and musical
  style) of the band. \r\n\r\nThe immediate application for this mark will be an approximately
  6 inch wide window decal (orange + white on clear vinyl). If the mark is flexible
  enough to be the band's permanent logo, that's gravy.\r\n\r\nAny typeface suggestions?
  I have much respect for y'all's opinion. Thanks.\r\n\r\nhttp://farm3.static.flickr.com/2282/2497543478_6b280bf7cc.jpg?v=0\r\nhttp://farm4.static.flickr.com/3174/2496717563_1b733b63e1.jpg?v=0\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If I'm honest, neither logo shout Rock 'n' Roll to me.  Obviously the term
    Rock 'n' Roll is wide ranging, but the first one using the Cooper typeface just
    looks more like a shop sign.  I prefer the 2nd one out of the two.  Obviously
    this is all subjective, but that's how I see it.  Maybe if you distressed the
    text somehow that may take things further, like the font is in example two. I'd
    suggest going to http://www.misterretro.com/image_filters.html to see what transformations
    some distressing can make.  As a positive though, I do like what you've done with
    the 'o' in the word tonight.\r\n\r\nJH"

    wide-ranging stuff.\r\n\r\nSorry I didn't specify earlier."

  body: "Hustler,\r\nThanks for the feedback. Their comments were that they wanted
    a different typeface than the ones I've shown here, opting for something more
    \"mature\". I think that they thought the youthful appearance of the first example
    and the distressed appearance of the second came off as too immature."

  body: "Maybe they can help you by refining their definition of 'mature', or better
    yet, maybe they can try and convey a period in time that would define them, so
    for example if they were a Ragtime band 'Art Nouveau' influenced fonts would be
    the right direction.  It might sound like they are being pigeonholed, but its
    worth a try as a starting point.  The (possibly) easier way is to ask them what
    types of fonts from other bands they like, so it gives you some idea.  I know
    it's always hard to figure out what someone wants simply based on a single word
    when it turns out you sometimes find that word they used bore no relation to what
    they end up being happy with.\r\n\r\nJH"
