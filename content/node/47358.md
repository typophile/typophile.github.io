  a monogram on our wedding invitations.&ensp;(Actually, I proposed with this design!)&ensp;My
  initials in Hebrew are \u05D9\u05D9\u05E9, my fianc\xE9e's are \u05D4\u05D4, and
  my last name is spelled with a \u05E9.\r\n&emsp;The basic idea was one of these
  two designs:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monogram concept_5764.jpg]I preferred
  the first, and the drafts below reflect that, but some folks have suggested the
  second version.\r\n&emsp;Trouble I'm having is with the middle head of the large
  \u05E9.&ensp;I've tried for something abstract, but I'm worried that it still looks
  like something \"belongs\" there.&ensp;I avoided the usual shape for the middle
  head for exactly that reason: it looked like the letter \u05D6 or \u05D5 was intended.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monogram

    \u05D4's on the left, or mem sofit? And the rightmost \u05D9 is so close that

    central element has a large centre with letters on both sides (stems). Except
    for the yod on the right, you have to guess them all. Without knowing which letters
    you mean, I read (RTL): ain, yod, mem sofit, mem sofit.\r\n\r\nThen, simha is
    not happy at all with the het and heh looking the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way,

  body: "David:&ensp;I see where the <em>h\u0323et</em> (\u05D7) & <em>heh</em> (\u05D4)
    might be confused (sorry simh\u0323a!), but that's a bug in the Hebrew alphabet.&ensp;If
    I were turning the surrounding text into a font I might try to differentiate them
    more, but in this context, with its well-known quote\xB9, I figured I could prefer
    \u2018pretty\u2019 over \u2018more readable\u2019.\r\n&emsp;That the <em>h\u0323et</em>
    (\u05D7) looks somewhat like the <em>mem</em> (\u05DE) from some fonts is harder
    for me to see; it certainly doesn't look like the <em>mem</em> I'm using!&ensp;Similarly
    with the <em>shin</em> (\u05E9) and the Rashi script <em>bet</em> (\u05D1): there's
    some similarity, but no real possibility of confusion.\r\n&emsp;The <em>vav</em>
    (\u05D5)/<em>yod</em> (\u05D9) confusion is less excusable, so a bit of background:&ensp;The
    style of the surrounding text came from an experiment I'd done in how wide I could
    extend Hebrew letters and have them recognizable.&ensp;To distinguish the <em>vav</em>
    (\u05D5) from the <em>yod</em> (\u05D9) from the <em>resh</em> (\u05E8) I chose
    to make the <em>yod</em> as short as I could while keeping the basic shape and
    making the <em>vav</em> the narrow exception to the extended style.&ensp;The `bump'
    on the <em>shin</em> (\u05E9) and the awkwardness of the <em>ayin</em> (\u05E2)
    are both also results of this original design.&ensp;I liked the <em>alef</em>
    (\u05D0) I'd done, but it's only here in the tiny text.\r\n\r\nEran/Simh\u0323a:&ensp;I
    vaguely see an <em>ayin</em> (\u05E2) in the right stem\u2014where I\u2019d intended
    <em>yod yod shin</em> (\u05D9\u05D9\u05E9), but I cannot see how the <em>heh heh</em>
    (\u05D4\u05D4) on the left looks like a <em>mem mem</em> (\u05DD\u05DD) to you.&ensp;I
    guess I should take it in account anyhow.\r\n&emsp;\u2026 But:&ensp;Once you know
    what letters they're supposed to be, do you see them, or still what you saw first?&ensp;It
    doesn't need to be obvious <em>a priori</em>; if it works <em>a posteriori</em>
    it's good too.\r\n&emsp;(Modern bias?)\r\n\r\n\u2014Joel\r\n\r\n1.&ensp;Jeremiah
    33:10\u201311:&ensp;\u201CYet again there shall be heard \u2026 in the cities
    of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, \u2026 (11) the voice of joy and the
    voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride\u201D."
