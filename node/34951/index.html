<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Every day we are exposed to typography of all levels - rare is the treasured occasion that we find truly moving type in public. Part of me loves this fact, as the discovery and appreciation of great type is a special treat. Another part of me gets impatient that not enough people (designers and general public alike) care about good typography, which, of course, means that there are poor design choices being made regularly, and published nonetheless!
Alas, my (our) obsession with type brings with it a curse: scrutiny of absolutely everything that uses letters. How many of us can read something without considering the appropriateness of the choices of typeface, proportion, kerning, leading, et cetera?
For better or worse, this is something we all must deal with on a day-to-day basis as typophiles. I'm curious to know how others handle this issue.
Thanks,
Ray</div>

<div class=commentbody>When I encounter banal music (like when my wife drags me to Big-Lots, for instance), I like to counter it by whistling as though I am tone-deaf. This requires abusing interval relationships, as well as pitch.
I don't know why this helps, but I get a tremendous kick out of it. It isn't always easy for me, so it has the feel of an exercise. I sometimes wonder what someone in the next aisle might think if they overheard, but I figure that it should make them feel good about their own abilities.
Unfortunately I can think of no corollary application to your dilemma.</div>

It warms my heart to hear I am not alone. It would be interesting to find that there are throngs of us. Maybe even have recitals akin to karaoke. I just wish a real money-making idea could capture my imagination like my obviously cockamamie ideas can.

<div class=commentbody>fontplayer, of all places for me to meet another atonal harmonizer, I would have never guessed here. My wife and I are both trained musicians, and we are each guilty of the same performances of which you speak. And, somehow, I understand the correlation to my original post.
Miss T: How very zen of you. I agree wholeheartedly; that's kind of what I was alluding to in acknowledging the "rare and special treat" part of the post.
Thanks for your responses.

<div class=commentbody>i don't know.
i know some people who are incredibly articulate and eloquent in their speech. just listening to them can seem like a treat ( or even more than that; when you hear something that really <em>reaches</em> you, it's sometimes possible to say to yourself, "yes. that's what <em>I </em> wish i'd said...")

<div class=commentbody>"How many of us can read something without considering the [type]"
A good question. I read almost everything without considering the type. It is only when I am being paid to do so, or, if there is "something wrong" in something I'm obliged or attracted to reading that I do consider it. It did, however, take me no short time and it was incomplete until I'd made a decidedly type-sparse environment. From the refrigerator to approximately 6 miles in all directions, superfluous type is rare.
This is not to say that there are not incredibly dense areas of type in the home/office, but they are kept at bay and hardly ever left in the right-reading position. As this is the point of view a type of a designer-with-an-outlet, it may be different from that of a non-type designing typophile — i.e. I can say to myself, "Well that looks bad", when I trip over something bad from a print ad to an OS. "Poor thing." But then I can put it to rest by making sure whatever I saw wrong "out there" is right in the font , fonts, or composition in progress.
Graphic designing typophiles must get similar satisfaction each time they don't do something bad they remember seeing done, don’t they? If they don't I think they should.
Cheers

<div class=commentbody>agree with the "curse" section. This is more of a passion, every big passion has its drawbacks... not enough of course to drop a passion like this for typography. This happens to everything you know in depth, i mean, even as a graphic designer, i see somethings and a shiver of discuss comes to me. I am a beginner on typographic design but even I catch myself analyzing everything i lay my eyes on. Grids Colors Typography Shapes. We have passed to the zone where seeing equals in depth analysis. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I sometimes say to myself 'that is pretty bad', but usually I can just set it aside and be on my merry way. I only wonder sometimes how the designer could have done something bad like that, but more importantly; how the client could have approved it. But that occurs more often with respect to architecture then typography. Because there are SO many ugly buildings being built (over here anyway), which have a far greater influence on my surroundings.
But, it is more the well-typeset and beautiful pieces that catch my eye, instead of the ugly ones.</div>

I went driving around LA with a friend on Wed. and one place we visited was USC, which surprised both of us by being one of the worst examples of uncoordinated architecture we have ever seen.
For such a prestigious school, it defies logic. Not to mention it is surrounded in all directions by some of the funkiest parts of LA.
And people go in debt for a good part of their lives to attend there.

<div class=commentbody>Yes, it surprises me all the time. The most horrible buildings are built here. Obviously the architects in question can sell their designs very, very well. Or the city officials just don't know what good design is. Uncoordinated is the right word indeed.
But then again, the centre of the city where I live (Groningen, The Netherlands) is very old, and there are a lot of beautiful old buildings. The new buildings that are designed by those pretentious architects just are no match; the contrast is huge.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Noses in the air should not be equated with the right to critical comment. If someone calls himself a professional and is paid to do typographic work, he/she takes on the likelihood of comment by their peers for better or for worse. This does not mean name-calling or personal attack but well documented critical commentary on the work presented is fair game.
As I said initially, I have no issue with a mom&pop store putting up their hand made signs in their store--they are just doing the best they can. My issue is with the self-proclaimed pro who takes the money and runs amuck.

<div class=commentbody>Eventually (hopefully) you will outgrow an obsessiveness to scrutinize type.
To mature as a designer, typographer, type designer, you need to be able to <em>see</em> with "fresh innocent eyes" at will. If one always approaches a piece with clinical scrutiny, then one is not able to experience the initial expression of what that piece has to offer.
The same holds true with many other skilled or artistic professions; culinary arts, music, film making, etc. It is the <em>first impression</em> which should remain unique and/or memorable, not the minutia.
It is the minutia that enhances the overall experience, but you can't receive that experience by focusing on the minutia. Sort of like not seeing the forest because the trees are in your way.
Train yourself to see without <em>typographic eyes</em> at will, since there will always be time for nit-picking afterwards.</div>

Instead of nose-picking, Norbert? :-)

<div class=commentbody>There's a reference even I barely remember. Speaking of getting old: I was mentioning to someone that I was upset with Jack LaLanne for painting such a rosey picture of getting old. He said there is a lesson to be learned there.
I asked what it was. He said, "Never trust a man in leotards." - Something rings true about that.
