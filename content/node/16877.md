  Criticism, even constructive, can be hard to take. But I'd rather learn and improve
  than sit in a cardboard box with a towel over my head, so... any comments you have
  about this layout would be greatly valued.\r\n\r\nIt's for a garden, and will possibly
  be lasercut into an A3-sized block of wood. If not, it'll just be digitally printed
  onto a panel. The typeface, Interstate, is used throughout the site. I've basically
  sought to reference the ripple effect of water, and to create rivers around the
  distinct phrases. I've used loose tracking to... loosen things up, they way the
  body does when you're 'running', 'talking' and 'walking'.\r\n\r\nIs that enough
  of my thinking to go on? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: I'll let others more competent than myself do the critiqueing. However, I'd
    like you to reconsider the box/towel covered head bit. Not because your stuff
    is bad, rather I feel like doing just that a number of times per day, and I suspect
    my life would be more peaceful if I gave in. . . . ;)

    body: "I think you might be right about the box/towel thing. First day back at
      work for 2006 and crawling into a box seems like a great idea. :-)\r\n\r\nSo
      is there really nothing that anyone can say about this layout? I really would
      appreciate your comments and suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "I get what you're trying to do with the different sizes and loose placement
    of the words/phrases, but the effect - for me - is not quite as peaceful or calming
    the words suggest. Maybe try a little more leading and perhaps not quite as many
    sizes of type - or a little more uniformity to the sizes. Then the phrases might
    flow a bit more, rather than seeming to start and stop.\r\n\r\nPersonally I tend
    to find it hard to read type where the tracking is greater than the leading."

  body: Thanks a lot for your comments, Patty. I've made some changes to my file,
    but I can't post a new attachment! From a quick search I see that this is a problem
    that others have had. Does anyone know if there's a work-around?

    your setting I would like to know what the animals are doing, but I will wait
    before seeing your amendments. If you print this direct to media a nice grainy
    wood will add to the flow.\r\nTim"

  body: "Ok, I've added a second image to my original post. Thanks for the tip. I'm
    using Safari. I thought that had the Flash plug-in built-in? Oh well. \r\n\r\nI've
    tried to make this version lighter, and to flow more gracefully. I certainly think
    it feels calmer than my first one. Although I'm not sure if it's now a bit too
    floaty?\r\n\r\nTimd, I don't quite understand what you mean by 'what the animals
    are doing'? Do you mean that the layout doesn't reflect the 'walking' aspect?\r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "I - for one - like the new layout much better. It's more toned down, relaxing
    and quiet, doesn't feel like it's yelling at me like the first one. I think that's
    more the garden/water mood.\r\n\r\nOne small point, in the line SMALL ROCKS AND
    BIG ROCKS I might make the AND the smaller size. It doesn't need that kind of
    emphasis and also if it's smaller the BIG will stand out more as larger."

  body: The second layout is much better. The poem doesn't seem llike a torrent of
    water. I can almost here the babbling brook in the words of the poem. That is
    what you should try to emulate. I think the second gets closer to it than the
    first. Do you have a lighter weight of this same typeface? A little variety could
    be very nice.

    body: "Good point with the 'AND'. I always feel a little conflicted when I come
      across words like 'big' and 'small'. Making them BIG and small seems too obvious
      and literal, but it seemed right this time from a textural point-of-view. \r\n\r\nI
      do have the lighter weights. I didn't use them initially because the piece needs
      to be legible from a distance, and I was concerned that a lighter weight might
      be too thin. Particulalry as there's the possibility it will be cut into wood,
      so the contrast might not be as high. I guess I need to get an answer on the
      wood question. In the meantime, I've used a lighter weight and, yeah, it does
      give the texture a little more variety.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

    while the birds are talking <strong>in the trees</strong>, it might be your intention
    to leave the reader to consider that (I don't know the original poem). Your latest
    revision has the qualities you were looking for I question why animals are treated
    in a smaller point size than birds although I think you are right to avoid that
    box created by the ellipsis and quote in your first post.\r\nTim"
