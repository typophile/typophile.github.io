body: "I am making a font that has contiguous lines running through through all the
  glyphs including the space. When testing, much to my chagrin, I found that apps
  like Illustrator and InDesign (and possibly everything else) don't like that. The
  weight looks wrong to begin with, and it vanishes altogether when converted to outlines,
  becoming an actual space. \r\n\r\nI've solved the problem (in what feels like a
  Jerry-rigged way) with an OpenType feature to swap the space with another glyph,
  (or allowing users the option to pull it from the glyph pallet) but this requires
  users to know to do that. Seems to me to be a less than elegant solution.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?
  \r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nR\r\n\r\n"
