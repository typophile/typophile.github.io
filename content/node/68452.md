  people like \"Mbtshoes\" drawn and quartered, I'd like to suggest that it might
  be a good idea to make it slightly more difficult to register a typophile account
  in an effort to cut down on such rudeness. I have virtually no knowledge of designing
  web sites, so I don't know whether any of these suggestions are actually feasible
  without dumping a huge amount of work on someone.\r\n\r\nA couple of ways to do
  this might include:\r\n\r\n(A) A short time-delay between the creation of an account
  and gaining posting privileges (say a couple of hours which might be sufficient
  to encourage spammers to go elsewhere).\r\n\r\n(B) Some sort of rather trivial quiz
  to demonstrate an actual interest in type (I'm thinking along the lines of a series
  of multiple choice questions with answers easily tracked down on the typowiki, e.g.
  'An example of a neoclassical design would be (a) Bembo, (b) Charlotte Sans, (c)
  Bell, (d) Avant Garde Gothic', (e) Fette Fraktur).\r\n\r\nDon't know if others agree
  whether such a step would be desirable.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    <em>can</em> be there 24/7. <em>You</em> don\u2019t have to be.\r\n\r\nAlso, as
    mathowie explained on the Pipeline podcast, the admin tools they\u2019ve built
    enable all admins to glance at such tools five minutes out of every hour to keep
    on top of what\u2019s going on. This site is in denial of several facts (it has
    problems, it can be improved, it has admins not moderators), but in this context
    being in denial of the fact that all this has been handled well elsewhere before
    means that <em>nothing ever changes</em>. \u201CThis job is so hard and we can\u2019t
    work 24/7!\u201D is not an argument when there are proven methods to reduce the
    workload and provide round-the-clock administration.\r\n\r\nNow some asshole\u2019s
    gonna chime in with a personal insult, if history is any guide. Nobody here likes

    days is coming from newly created blogs. One option would be to moderate all new
    first-time blog posts. Not sure how doable that'd be.\r\n\r\nAs for the trolls,
    it's not that bad on Typophile compared to most online forums. At least the trolls
    we do have have some character. "

  body: "With the recent addition of Florian (in Europe) and me (in the U.S. Eastern
    time zone) as Admins, due to the last round of complaints about lingering spam,
    I think we\u2019ve been doing a better job of cleaning up around here lately.
    \r\n\r\nMost of the spam bots tend to attack in the overnight hours (relative
    to the western hemisphere), and I think we usually come along and clean up most
    within about three hours.\r\n\r\nNow, that may not be quick enough to prevent
    some folks from being annoyed (I can\u2019t blame them), depending upon what hours
    one keeps. But I think things have improved.\r\n\r\nThe janitorial service that
    Florian and I perform is the kind of thankless job that goes unnoticed when it\u2019s
    under control. Most have no idea what we\u2019re already managing to handle.\r\n\r\nSo,
    while the situation can still stand much more improvement, I take some small offense
    to the <em>\u201Cnothing ever changes\u201D</em> over-generalization.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    not to say Florian and I wouldn\u2019t love to see more impediments in place to
    begin with. We\u2019ve been making suggestions to the Punchcut site owners."
