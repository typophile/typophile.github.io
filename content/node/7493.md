body: I&#39;ve checked Spire Regular as noted in an old thread; however the bottom
  of Spire&#39;s G is curvier and more rounded than in the GAP logo. I&#39;ve done
  an Advanced Search on this board but nothing else is coming up-Does anyone know
  this one? thank you

  body: I see what you mean about the G and my guess is that it was customized for
    this logo. Usually rounded characters descend ever so slightly below the baseline
    but it seems that this was adjusted so that it would line up. <BR> <BR>Otherwise
    it looks identical to Spire.

  body: Thank you for your reply. I thought I was seeing things with the G; I&#39;m
    glad that a true typophile sees it also.

    <BR>If you see below, I&#39;ve taken Lanston&#39;s Spire and added a stroke to
    it. Not exact, but close. <BR> <BR>My Verson <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/52742.gif"

  body: Thank you all so much for your suggestions.  Spire Regular and Lanston&#39;s
    Spire noted above are the closest so far, guess I&#39;ll keep looking around.
