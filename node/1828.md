  body: BJ, onomatopoeia is a beautiful word.  <BR> <BR>Had to look it up. But it
    beats sesquipedalian any day, which I feel is over-mentioned by now. <BR> <BR>Btw,
    is your nick a play on PJ Harvey? For the longest time, I thought you were a girl,
    based on your nick.

  body: '&#62;&#62; Btw, is your nick a play on PJ Harvey? <BR> <BR>yes. kinda sorta.
    <BR> <BR>: information nobody really needs  : <BR> <BR>Harvey is a nickname that
    stretches back to <BR>2nd grade...a English shortcut for people who couldn&#39;t
    <BR>pronounce my last name, Jaramillo&#42;. Started as Harmi. <BR>Shortened to
    Harv. <BR> <BR>bj, those would be my initials...when I was getting ready to <BR>send
    Charles Anderson &#40;Chank&#41; some fonts two years ago <BR>October, I was looking
    for a nickname, so bj harvey was the <BR>obvious choice...Polly Jean, she rocks.
    <BR> <BR>I since learned there are &#42;lots&#42; of bj harveys out there... <BR>a
    football player, a poet, a councilwoman, a lion tamer...not me, btw. <BR> <BR>:

    Do check out all of the GType <BR>fonts. Cooke has designed some very good stuff.  <BR>Sadly,
