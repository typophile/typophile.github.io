  font?

    are available on DaFont. It&#39;s pretty depressing... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: Both &#34;Beautiful ES&#34; and &#34;Splendid ES&#34; are rip-offs of Bickham
    Script, which is protected by US Design Patents 407,108 and 426,570. This definitely
    infringes our patents. <BR> <BR>They didn&#39;t even change the em square either,
    so it&#39;s easy to see that the outlines seem to be stolen too &#40;modulo conversion
    to TrueType&#41;, which would violate our copyright as well. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    pointed our legal and anti-piracy folks at it. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Im glad Thomas, I love the orginial, and I was disturbed at how it could be
    on their &#34;top100&#34; and be so obviously and completely stolen. I was going
    to throw it to you specifically, but I figured you&#39;d see it on the post.

    That&#39;s pretty impressive.

    Splendid Quartett Italic.

  body: Maybe Thomas got the names mixed up. The other Bickham is <BR><a href="http://dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=601&amp;page=2"
    target="_blank">Champignon</a>. I see plenty of other knockoffs on that page alone.

  body: Urp, right, Splendid is something else. But &#34;Beautiful ES&#34; is definitely
    Bickham Script. Should have looked more carefully. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thomas Adobe has a far bigger problem. I&#39;m getting e-mails about one a
    week from people selling Photoshop CS for $79. Adobe should have a place on their
    site to be able to report the emails who follow this ripoff practice. It annoys
    me I pay full freight for Adobe products and someone rips them off like this.

    <BR> <BR>Heh. I&#39;ve toyed with the idea too, but there&#39;s a couple of  <BR>thousand
    fonts on there...

  body: Stephen said <i>The other Bickham is  <BR>Champignon.</i> I beg to differ.
    Champignon is a digital version of &#39;Champion&#39; by Francois Boltana. I have
    samples of both in my Script Font ID Guide.
