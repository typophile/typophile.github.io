<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>okay, so i'm trying to put together a portfolio and i've only tried my hand at a couple of logos. The first, Tessa B's, i rather like, but i think it needs a bit more polish. The second, ShoeBox, is really rough. I pretty much swiped the design idea from the Beatles. Is it even worth salvaging? showcasing? anyhow, i thought i'd just see if i got any response here. thnx for any help you can give me. <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif align=left alt=application/x-shockwave-flash>Tessa4Flash<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Tessa_B_logo-39169.swf target=_blank><b>Tessa B logo.SWF</b></a> (4.3 k)</td></tr></table></center><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39170.gif alt=Tessa.gif><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif align=left alt=application/x-shockwave-flash>Shoebox4Flash<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Shoebox_logo-39171.swf target=_blank><b>Shoebox logo.SWF</b></a> (2.8 k)</td></tr></table></center><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39172.gif alt=Shoebox.gif></div>

<div class=commentbody>Shoeboxtoo i see. What is the too for? <br> <br>The S, O, and B you should weight thicker. <br> <br>Fix the counters on the B. <br> <br>Shoe has a lot of white space. I'd open up Boxtoo <br>which is pretty tight. <br> <br>Tracing over the logo always helps me to get rid of inconsistencies. <br> <br>I'd put a "polished" shoebox in my 'folio. <br>Good stuff. <br> <br>Andrew</div>

I don't know why they need the too in the name at all, but that's their thing. <br>thnx again for yer help. anyone else have suggestions?</div>

<div class=commentbody>The Tessa B is cute! <br>Is the curl above the face meant to resemble hair? Seems like a good concept but do you think the style of the lines in the face matches the letter style enough? Something I think strong logos have is an overall sense of moving to the right or facing the right (the same direction as if it were being read with text) are strongest. Layouts, signs, etc. that face the right feel more natural to me. (??) <br>Lastly, the bullet seems to large, and maybe it isn't necessary at all? <br>I'm not sure the e in Tessa and the h in hair have to line up. Does it put too much emphasis on essa? Dunno. <br> <br>For shoebox, I like the funky-shaped counters in everything. The two o's do seem like they may need more space at the link for when the logo gets reduced to teeny tiny. <br> <br>An idea is to apply the logo to packaging, etc. to give it more of a context. But if you have lots of logos, you probably would be fine just showing it with others. <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>hey thnx brian, 'preciate yer help <br> <br><i>Is the curl above the face meant to resemble hair?</i> <br>yeah it is. i guess i don't have it quite right if it's not obvious. <br> <br>i think the bullet and the lining up were input from my client, but i can do whatever i want for my own purposes. <br> <br><i> Something I think strong logos have is an overall sense of moving to the right</i> <br> <br>hmmm, i'm not sure how i could fix that for Tessa </div>
