  articles, researchers,..) on the geometric analysis of letter shapes. All typography
  books and sites I have seen are concerned on type design aesthetically and historically,
  but do not address its geometric, non-artistic and non-aesthetic foundations:\r\n
  - decomposition of letters in sub-shapes, structure of sub-shapes and comparison
  of letters' super-structures\r\n - mathematical definitions of distance between
  shapes and letters, geometric definition of legibility\r\n - analysis of 1D (no
  width) versus 2D (with width), geometric analysis of fonts\r\n - geometric analysis
  and comparisons (and critiques) of fonts, of alphabets\r\n - conceptualisation of
  new letters\r\n - ....etc.\r\n\r\nDoes it even exist? Who in the world and history
  of typography has written about these fundamental topics?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nPierre\r\n"

      been artistic choice in the definition of letters since the very beginnings,

      design that puts this aspect away for a moment and concentrate on the geometry.\r\nThe
      works you mentioned are fascinating, and the majesty of roman capitals hasn't
      lost its grandeur. I wonder if something like this was made in modern times
      for lower cases, do you know?\r\n\r\nAfter all, modern typesetting tools are
      extremely mathematical, as they define every typeface via vectorial settings

      of the king Louis XIV, however is not yet what I am after. It defines a typeface,
      but I am after the common underlying structure that can define that an "h" is
      an "h" and not a "k", in any typeface. I am after the definition of the nature
      of "x" and "o". Just like in music the convention of note pitches evolved to
      what it is today, I am wondering if there has been modern (by which I probably
      mean 20th/21st century) attempts to define our unspoken conventions for Type.

  body: "Interesting question. Most  times a computer displays a letter or prints
    it it is implementing a scheme to reduce the geometry of the bezier curves defining
    the outline to pixel positions - it is all very mathematical. Thankfully the designer
    only tweaks the vector handles and need not bother with the maths.\r\n\r\nIf what
    you are seeking is the simplest mathematical way to represent letters, analytic
    geometry can do that. For example  a very thin san-serif I 10 units high is represented
    by  x=0 , With y more than zero and less than 10. I tried typing more than with
    its symbol the tilted v, but the html thinks it is the end of the paragraph and
    deletes the rest! Representing a generic O  is in the form x^2+(y-5)^2=26 (which
    adds an optical adjustment of half a unit!) where ^ represents \"to the power\".
    An x needs two lines one of which is x=y  between zero and 10 for both x and y,
    and so on. Graphic plotters would use some such representations in the software
    programs. Hope I got all this right!"

      complex, taking colours, zones of pixels and pixels themselves all into account
      to refine, simplify or break the original bezier curves and shape contours.
      Thankfully I am not interested in this, but in the definition of the letter
      \"templates\", the mental geometric constructs that our brain create early on
      in our lives that make us recognise each letter.\r\n\r\nYour second paragraph
      is a part of the answer: yes the simple template for an \"I\" is a vertical
      line, the template for an \"O\" or \"o\" is a vertical ellipse, and \"x\" and
      \"X\" are made of intersecting lines.\r\nThose are the simplest letters, the
      simplest structures and if we calculate an average of those letters in every
      typeface, we can expect the deviation to be small. Some letters may have higher
      deviations, for instance the \"a\", \"g\", \"z\".. Those averages and deviations
      can be calculated, and from this work a convention can emerge.\r\nI am looking
      for people and resources who worked on this."

    is not my objective, however could be an outcome of the ability to compare and

    an interesting discussion: it might be the case that an average \"g\" isn't as
    pretty, simple, or recognisable as it could be, hence the ability to optimise
    templates. But one cannot form an ideal without being able to assess the present.
    Right now, every typographer has his/her own representation and judgements of
    types, and his/her own ideals, without an objective way to contrast and compare,
    as it typography was pure design/art, and not also a social communication tool

    is fun but I rather agree with Nick. Fonts evolve and whatever is currently most
    used/liked is the acceptable shape of the letter. Cultural influences play a large
    part.. for example when Arabic numerals  were introduced to Europe they were very
    close to the Arabic script in style. Since then they have evolved to match Latin  letters
    serifs and all. Some misguided literary people in Beirut in the 1950s 'discovered'
    these Westernized  numerals and adopted them as the original Arabic numerals!
    Now they are the norm sticking out like sore thumbs between the Arabic type, while
    the traditional Arabic numerals (Indic) languish for non-use. Similar outrages
    are now plaguing Arabic fonts whereby one of the Google web fonts all but unreadable
    is being adopted for its novelty. Glyphs  change.

    But I concur that the recognition of letterforms impose to ability to compare,
    and the 'knowledge' of templates, so I should investigate. In addition to a geometric
    analysis, I would also like to see reflexions on the nature of letter forms, semio/socio/psycho-logic
    aspects, poetic too, something like what Bachelard did for elements (space, fire,
    dreams) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Bachelard and such a reflection, I
    think, should come from a combination of art and science. A conceptual foundation
    for typography that would feed into/explain the choices designers make daily in
    their choices: why egyptian slabs on the word 'God'? Why should the official printout
    of the european constitution have high ascenders?..etc.\r\n\r\n@Nick: in what
    I have seen, most analysis of type is done of the \"external\" side of type. Let's
    define the \"internal\" side of type as the conceptual/abstract definition of
    letter forms, the \"templates\": e.g. an \"o\" is a circle, or vertical ellipse.
    \ The \"external\" aspect of type is about the surrounding aspects: counter size,
    ellipse direction, overhang dimension, natural/grunge aspects as you mention them,..etc.
    It's the internal aspects I'm interested about. I agree with you and the others
    that a geometric analysis of the external aspects doesn't lead far.\r\n\r\n@DTY:
    very interesting, however I would ask an Artificial Intelligence team to go further:
    let's assume we have a group of A.I. beings, who are communicating orally with
    a basic language, then let's make them mute but let's give them the ability to
    draw.. what sort of shapes would they draw in order to communicate? In other words,
    what are the cognitive factors at play in the construction of a written language?

    templates not being geometric. And it's not necessarily about defining things

    has _those_ relations between the \"i\" and the \"o\", has _these_ characteristics
    compared to a \"g\".. and why does it need a terminal and/or a finial instead
    of being clear-cut at its center? For reasons of history or legibility? Is the
    \"c\" the easiest letter to write by hand, as it looks like it's part of a group

      Haven't you ever felt that the uppercase P or F were in danger of falling? Do
      you sense the majesty of the A, Eiffel tower, star of the alphabet. The B is
      so fat it's not even funny. One can't spell slim, thin, and lean with it. Glyphs

      the eternal beauty of an H, ladder to Heaven? Who will say there's simply something
      wrong and awkward with k, r and Q? \r\nMore seriously, is our alphabet geometrically
      sound? In the sense of: is there a geometric balance between all letters or
      are some letters very different from each other while some are very (too) similar
      to each other? I am surprised by the purity of x and o and their opposition,
      and I wonder if the resemblance of m and n and u may be a (hidden, taboo) legibility
      issue. What shapes does our alphabet ignore? The tree letters c, u, n have open
      counters going right, up, down, but why not (suspending our anthropocentric
      judgement) a letter with a left one, like a b without a stem? \r\n(I'm not trying

    certainly could borrow the numerals from any number of Latin typefaces designed
    to simulate Arabic or Chinese, or even just from a calligraphic typeface.\r\n\r\nI
    can think, though, of a number of reasons this option was rejected.\r\n\r\nSince
    Arabic does have its own set of digits, it may have been thought that the foreign
    ones <em>should</em> stand out, so that people don't get too comfortble with them.
    And an attempt to stylistically Orientalize the Western digits could well have
    been perceived as patronizing and so on. Or, in a more pragmatic vein, since those
    weren't the forms people were taught from childhood to recognize, if they don't
    stand out as alien, they have the potential to cause confusion and slow reading.\r\n\r\nWhen
    English texts include words in Greek, Hebrew, Chinese, or some other language
    with a different script, ordinary typefaces for those scripts are used - often,
    the equivalent of Century Expanded for the Latin script: the plainest and most
    standard typeface one can find.\r\n\r\nIn the hot metal era, that would simply
    be all that the printer would have on hand. (For Greek, there is a particular
    convention, known as Porson Greek, with its own history.)\r\n\r\nThere is no temptation
    to handle those scripts with a hyper-Latinized typeface so that they will \"fit
    in\" visually with the surrounding text.\r\n\r\nIf a paragraph suddenly contained,
    say, a word or phrase in heavily Latinized Gujarati... say (and the Gujarati script
    happens to lend itself to such treatment, with relatively simple forms and no
    Devanagari overbar - and I've seen it done too for display typography in that
    language)... unless context were to indicate the language likely to be used, the
    reader would likely be utterly perplexed as to what language these strange symbols
    might belong.\r\n\r\nCome to think of it, this is an indictment of the \"unified\"
    sans-serif typefaces currently being designed for mobile devices, which are the
    subject of another recent thread: they may be great for their intended purpose
    in user interfaces, but they are probably <strong>not recommended</strong> for
    (the kind of) scholarly publication (that includes interspersed quotes from different
    languages)."

    context will usually disambiguate them.\r\n\r\nThey were different shapes prior
    to typography, but ironically, from your perspective, type design has brought
    them closer together, because of both the recognition of textual context for providing
    meaning, and typography\u2019s ability to nuance the basic shapes with details
    that relate to how the bicameral (upper and lower case) system has evolved, namely
    stem thickness, relative height, and serif treatment.\r\n\r\nSo the identicality
    of I and l is not a bug, but a feature that contributes to the overall readability
    of typography\u2014although not of course individual glyph legibility.\r\n\r\nI
    would argue that, assessing the pros and cons of the simple vertical line as a
    glyph shape for two separate characters, the economy and simplicity of this shape
    is so powerful that the efficiency (both in execution and recognition) obtained
    by using it outweighs the drawbacks. This is what design is, a compromise (or
    transcendent raprochement) between competing criteria, in this instance legibility
    and readability.\r\n\r\nThe same principal has allowed us to identicalize the
    character forms of O, o, zero, degree and ring, distinguishing them with subtle,
    typographically meaningful transformations of the basic round shape, without resorting
    to making any of them heart-shaped."

    could not disagree more strongly, and I would say the research significantly contradicts
    the first half of your statement.\r\n\r\nAs for the second part, although it is
    *also* important how the glyphs combine, to the extent that the relative contributions
    to legibility have been specifically studied, it appears to be quite a lot less
    important than the individual glyph shapes. If you're talking relative importance,
    you have it backwards.\r\n\r\nSorry I don't remember the specific study right
    now. It's the last one mentioned in the relevant chapter of Sofie Beier's book
    on legibility. I think it was 2011, an Italian sounding name starting with an
    R perhaps. But I just loaned out my copy of the book last night.  :(\r\n\r\nI
    should also say that any discussion of the relevant contributions and importance
    of two variables is dependent on the population variability of each variable.
    So for example, if you create a font by taking glyphs from a totally random or
    unrelated set of fonts, you'll suddenly \"discover\" that how the glyphs combine
    makes a huge difference. But within the norms of type design, according to the
    one study on the topic, it was more like 3:1 for individual glyphs over any higher-level

    is a given, and the important task, for disambiguation, is both to make sure they
    are not confused, and also to harmonize their treatment stylistically. \r\n\r\nIn
    a typeface comprised entirely out of straight lines, these nominally circular
    or oval characters become quadrilateral, yet this conceit is taken in stride by
    the reader. Again, it is the type designer\u2019s task to make sure that a particular

    sensible: it's just a limited set of arbitrary shapes that typographers are forced
    to play with.</cite>\r\n\r\nYes, but the alphabet very slowly and gradually developed
    over time.\r\n\r\nSome of the developments are hard to understand. The ancient
    Phoenician alphabet seems, to modern eyes accustomed to the Latin alphabet, to
    be quite legible - and it developed into the Greek alphabet and then the Latin
    one, legible as well by that standard.\r\n\r\nBut other descendants include the
    Hebrew square script, which has several glyph pairs that are hard to distinguish,
    Arabic script, with multiple glyphs distinguished only by added dots, and the
    elaborate offspring of the Brahmi script, itself plain and legible.\r\n\r\nThe
    explanation for the Arabic script, at least, is obvious - ease of writing, as
    with, say, Pitman shorthand. Some Indic scripts are also explicable, like one
    constrained by the need to write on palm leaves. But it's hard to justify what,
    for example, the Siamese have inflicted on themselves.\r\n\r\nHow could such a
    script have developed, with each incremental step being \"better\" than the one
    before? Of course, part of the issue is that the question \"better for what purpose\"
    may be missed. If mass literacy is not the goal, but a dignified presentation
    of traditional religious texts, an elaborate script is not an issue."

    can spell \u201C\uFB01sh\u201D.\r\nBut not in the sense that the shapes of the
    Latin alphabet have evolved based on vertical, horizontal and diagonal straight
    lines, and curves, with the lower case derived from shapes that have a certain
    amount of efficiency and \uFB02ow when written cursive.\r\n\r\nAlphabets are constructs
    of the hive mind, with some exceptions.\r\nCyrillic, and perhaps Korean.\r\nMore
    *logical* phonetic alphabets, such as the Shavian and ITA alphabets, those are
    hard to implement.\r\nThe alphabet does change though, when the individual initiatives
    go viral.\r\nTrissino\u2019s advocacy of adding /v and /j caught on, if not /\u03C9.\r\nAnd
    more recently, the sans serif has been responsible for single bowl /a and /g becoming
    acceptable.\r\nAnd even more recently, we \uFB01nd lower case /l with a tail.\r\n\r\nAlways
    options: for instance /W with crossing centre strokes, or /y based on /u with
    a tail.\r\n\r\nMy <a href=\"http://shinntype.com/typefaces/panoptica/\">Panoptic</a>

    information, and was ultimately able to find this\r\n\r\n[[http://books.google.ca/books?id=jcVKAAAAcAAJ]]\r\n\r\non
    the web - the book in which he suggested several augmentations to the alphabet,
    of which only J and V were accepted.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I trusted Wikipedia a bit too
    much; the new alphabet was used in this book about the nature of the Italian language,
    but the reformed spelling was actually proposed and advocated in <em>this</em>
    book:\r\n\r\n[[https://archive.org/details/image230corrMiscellaneaOpal]]\r\n\r\nor

    to add to the alphabet:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trissino_4640.jpg]\r\n\r\nThese
    letters were taken from two different spots in the work, one which gave the upper-case
    forms of the new letters, and another which gave the whole new alphabet in lower
    case.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have retouched them. In the case of the upper-case omega,
    I took off a burr probably caused by sticky dry ink or whatever; in the case of
    the lower-case j, I filled in a break caused by a lack of ink.\r\n\r\nBut in the
    case of the lowercase alternate z, I was more shameless - I stretched the bottom
    of the letter (by one pixel) so as to separate the two pieces of the letter that
    were touching at the top, so that what I believed to be its actual shape could
    be clearly seen.\r\n\r\nEDIT: On reviewing the document, I found I misidentified
    the glyph that was the lowercase counterpart of the alternate z; in fact, that
    pair of glyphs should be:\r\n\r\n(I seem to have a problem with inserting a further

    Trissino is not the inventor of the letter \xE7 - in fact, the Wikipedia article
    on the cedilla notes that the accent originated as the tail of a cursive Z, and
    so Trissino simply borrowed the older form, somewhere between the Visigoths and
    his Iberian contemporaries."
