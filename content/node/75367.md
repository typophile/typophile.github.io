    sheep ;-) I think a non-touching spacing could have been better."

  body: "Thanks for your kind words, everyone!\r\n\r\nRiccardo: I was thinking about
    (and working on) a non-touching version but it fell apart and looked weak for
    the regular and bold range. I might extend the family with a lighter non-touching
    text version but that would be quite a different thing.\r\n\r\nPaul: Gotcha! For
    the next I do font I should design that glyph!\r\n"

  body: "The touching lowercase are fine, but I think they should be more distant
    (even if touching) if you add a version for smaller sizes.\r\nPersonally I would
    not use this version under size 12 (I have looked at your PDF, I am not judging
    it printed, but it\u2019s an overall feeling: forms benefit from being larger
    and spacing bigger if the text-intensive application is to be favored).\r\nI like
    it. I think it would work very well in a lighter weight."

  body: "Herb originally had all weights from light to bold. I realised that it looks
    okay if the letters properly touch or not at all. If some combinations touch,
    others don't, some just a tiny bit, some just not, as it was the case, it looks
    odd. I decided to go for the properly touching option, which is the natural choice
    for the bolder weights, and make sure all combinations touch, not too little,
    not too much, or not at all. There are actually tons of kerning pairs because
    of this but one shouldn't brag with that. Also, I had to introduce a few contextual
    alternates to implement my either-or touching strategy.\r\n\r\nAt some point,
    I might indeed work on further weights that do not touch at all but this would
    probably work only in the light weights, not in between."
