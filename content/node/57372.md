  I've attached examples from the soundtrack CD cover and opening credits.

  body: "I think the felicity lettering is hand-drawn. The two i's are not the same,
    as evidence of this. The linking of the f and l is not something you would do
    in a font, in all likelihood.\r\n\r\nThe lettering around the frame in the first
    image is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-justlefthand/|FF Justlefthand]],
    if that is of any interest.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Yes, I thought that might be the case. Looking now at the two examples, I
    can see that even they are not identical. Bummer!
