  been used in schools, not very old, since rubber based, I guess.\r\nBut I like it
  and would like to make sure it's not already available before I vectorize it.\r\n\r\nthanks
  for your help,\r\nb."

    now is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/edison_condensed_bold/">Edison</a>,
    and that's not even close. Nice find!
