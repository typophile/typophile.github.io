  body: "Unfortunately, there is no standard. Each foundry has their own definition.
    \r\n\r\nMany, including [[FontFont]] share [[Adobe]]'s definition (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/OTGuide.pdf\">PDF</a>)
    in which the only difference is that Pro fonts feature expanded language support,
    such as CE, Turkish, Greek, and Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nOther foundries define their
    \"Standard\" OpenType fonts as a simple conversion from the legacy formats --
    no added features or bundled figure sets and small caps. Their \"Pro\" fonts have
    these extras."

  body: "More discussion <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/19012\">here</a>,
    including Thomas Phinney's official Adobe designation:\r\n\r\n<dl><dd>Adobe\u2019s
    practice is to use \u201CPro\u201D to designate (A) Latin fonts which have Adobe
    CE coverage in addition to the Adobe Western 2 character set, and (B) fonts with
    the Adobe-Japan1-5 or greater character set as opposed to fonts with the Adobe-Japan1-4
    or lesser character set.\r\n\r\nFor case (A), these fonts may also have Greek
    and/or Cyrillic coverage, but it is not required.\r\n\r\nFor OpenType fonts that
    do not have CE coverage, Adobe calls them \u201CStandard\u201D regardless of the
    number of features involved. For example, Poetica Standard is is the result of
    merging 17 Type 1 fonts and has quite a few OpenType features. Similarly, Utopia
    Standard has an awful lot of typographic extras, but no CE coverage.</dd></dl>"
