body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nwhat would be the typical ranges for (vertical) stroke width
  (expressed in fraction of the x-height) for thin, regular, demibold, bold etc.?\r\n\r\n(inversely
  you could state the x-heights expressed in vertical stroke widths)\r\n\r\nPrimarily
  of interest is serif fonts.\r\n\r\nThe reason for asking is, that some sketches
  I did (and intended as regular) look somewhat boldish-semiboldish, and I'm a bit
  uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks, guys!"

  body: "Strokes don\u2019t have typical proportions, varying proportions is an important
    source of personality, especially when it comes to serifs. What you need to do
    is identify the sort of values you want in existing typefaces, open them up in
    Fontlab, figure out what the proportions are, and compare your design to those
    numbers."

  body: 'Sorry, you slightly misunderstood me. Varying stroke with is a clear concept.
    However, vertical strokes tend to be pretty much the same width within one font.
    I was asking for typical proportion ranges for the vertical stem : x-height, if
    anyone would have had at the top of their head. It''d be so much easier than checking
    with a font editor 30-100 different fonts... :-)'
