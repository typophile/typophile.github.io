  body: I haven't tried it myself, but Glyphs is reported to have a much improved
    system for building accented glyphs. I'd love to try it, but I work on a PC.

    in the previwe panel by using the Anchors tab. It is not very comfortable but
    it works...\r\n\r\nEigi"

  body: "It is not one or the other. Anchors are tool to create composites quickly
    and consistently. When you have many diacritics positioned above/below certain
    character then use anchors. They are not very useful for positioning when only
    one accent is being placed and/or when the result needs to be decomposed and merged
    (e.g. aogonek, eogonek).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if you find achors too confusing,
    just use composites. It is not such a big deal.\r\n\r\nNote that anchors are not
    MM-compatible, that is their positions do not interpolate. You can fix that with
    some macros though. \u2026 or you can generate composites before interpolation.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    consider looking FLS manual for alias.dat. That can speed your process up a bit
    more."

  body: But how do you check problematic kerning pairs for accented glyphs created
    with anchors?
