  a theatrical play. The title is  <BR>&#34;Working Girls&#34; and is about  <BR>7
  women working in a clothing factory. <BR> <BR>Their life is captured in the hard
  and cold wheels  <BR>of the factory routine. Sometime they decide  <BR>to make a
  change by going down on strike <BR>...only to realize '

  body: i like 3rd one, becouse it looks for me as poster  <BR>about a theatrical
    play more than others.. 1st looks for me more as industrial advertizment and 2nd
    more az..  ..az..  ..non theatrical too<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I like the flair of number 3, but the concept of 2i. Number 3 does not convey
    &#34;clothing factory&#34;. Also, I really like the illustrations and colors of
    2.

  body: True. Although I think the &#34;clothing factory&#34; is where these women
    are trapped. This is what I read into the second concept. I would almost suggest
    just simplifying number 2i and make it as graphic as possible a la Bradbury Thompson.

    replacing the outside circle of the clock with a gear motif. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Ok. I&#39;ll be Miss Contrary. I like 2ii ... Framing &#40;space&#41;, Color,
    Basic Concept ... But, what if instead of parts of women&#39;s heads, you do a
    patter for a female doll? Taking your original idea of dotted lines and multiple
    colors, but have a head, a hairline, arms, torso, legs, feet ... all as separate
    pattern parts? Maybe you could somehow show that they are different women? ...
    All just thoughts. Your poster work is wonderful.

  body: 'Thank you all for the feedback... <BR> <BR>I wish i had time to try all the
    options you mentioned. What Dmitry and Tom wrote &#40;...&#34;nothing has changed&#34;../...the
    &#34;clothing factory&#34; is where these women are trapped...&#41; is the main
    idea.  <BR> <BR>It seems that the feminine symbol in #3, isn&#39;t that vivid
    so i should add something to support more the presence of woman &#40;Dmitry&#39;s
    idea about hand was good&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Hrant, your suggestion is correct but
    the gear motif as clock is used in the #3 poster, so is a matter of presentation
    policy not to use it again, but i will sure suggest it as a compination to the
    customer when the presentation will be on.  <BR> <BR>Tiffany i kept the same face
    in every square because i want to show that actually it is the same woman &#40;in
    different &#34;versions&#34;-colours&#41;, having the same problems, being in
    captured in the same cages. <BR> <BR>Oh, and i forgot to mention the fonts i used...DIN,
    Helvetica and Schnell. I would also like to have some comments about the usage
    of typography. <BR> <BR>Have a nice day, christos <BR> <BR>P.S. maybe it will
    seem a little &#34;over-patriotic&#34; to some, but i feel a little proud that
    an epica price given for first time to a greek designer. If you go and check <a
    href="http://www.epica-awards.com" target="_blank">www.epica-awards.com</a> there
    are really wonderfull works. The greek studio awarded for the symbols of the Olympic
    sports. The illustrations are great &#40;inspired by the ancient greek vase painting
    [melanomorfa=black shaped] &#41;.'

    makes sense. I didn&#39;t read that as a cage. But, that is not to say that others,
    who know the play, might understand more of the concept.'

  body: i love 2ii but there are only 7 women in the play, not 9. <BR> <BR>the numbers
    in each box may be confusing though.  is that metaphorical or something actually
    IN the play?  the colors are awesome in that and it totally embodies the idea
    of women working in a clothing factory. <BR> <BR>the first one is not unique enough
    to me... and the third one is too much like a book cover in my opinion.  they
    are all very very well done though.   <BR> <BR>2ii silkscreened would be great.

  body: 'loren, <BR> <BR>after i designed the 1st poster they told me that the number
    of the women was not important. So, i let the composition to work as it fit me.
    <BR> <BR>The time-numbers are refering to the pressure of time by being not &#34;round&#34;
    but precise. For example you will see 04:32 but not 12:00 or 4:30. <BR> <BR>christos '

  body: 'I like #3.  I think the repeating female cutouts suggests the drudgery of
    existence - the rubber stamp quality of working in a factory with the clock gears
    always advancing to make another paper doll day for the women that work there.  Also,
    I&#39;m a sucker for the script font: Greek just doesn&#39;t look right to me
    without diacritics. <BR> <BR>PS, where is the Amalia Theater?'
