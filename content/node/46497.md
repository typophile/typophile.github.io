  this is a font or drawn, but if anyone knows which font it might be i'd be most

  body: Maybe, it's similar, perhaps it's been outlined in illustrator and tweaked

    but it has the same kind of S shape as your sample. I think your idea that it
    was traced over and simplified is probably the answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
