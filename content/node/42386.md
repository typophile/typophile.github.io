  body: "My first graphic on this theme using the peace font Wahei created by Luc
    Devroye.\r\n\r\nColours represent individual nations/peoples, each nation/peoples
    peace sign is slightly different variation. The colours also rep other stuffs
    too, such as the environment, candy life savers... Although the grouping of peace
    signs are bunched tight together showing unity, each peace sign sould seem 'balanced'
    on top of one another, idea being a peaceful diverse balance. \r\n \r\nStencil
    variation next. \r\n\r\nThanks again Luc for the font!!"
