  body: The Republican elephant and Democrat donkey both originated as less than flattering
    portrayals of the parties, their supporters or candidates, which were then subverted
    to become positive emblems. The 19th Century cartoonist Thomas Nast was instrumental
    in both cases. I think this kind of evolution is much preferable to either the
    assignment of symbols by an election office as in Egypt, or the branding of parties
    by advertising agencies. To have had one's candidate called a jackass in 1828
    and to be wearing the emblem with pride almost two hundred years later seems to
    me admirable.

  body: "In Sweden seven out of the eight parties in parliament have a flower as a
    symbol, I assume starting with the Social Democrats' rose, which after all is
    a common symbol across Europe, but sort of spiraling away from there. The one
    exceptions is the mainstream centre-right Moderates, who use a stylised letter
    M as a symbol instead.\r\n\r\nSocial Democrats = Rose\r\nLeft Party (ex-communist)
    = Carnation\r\nGreen Party = Dandelion\r\nPeople's Party (law-and-order right,
    ex-neoliberal, ex-liberal) = Cornflower\r\nCenter party (neoliberal, ex-agrarian)
    = Clover\r\nChristian Democrats = Wood Anemone\r\nSweden Democrats (racist right-wing
    extremists) = Hepatica"
