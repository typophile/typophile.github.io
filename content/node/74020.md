  the overlap with some other threads!\r\n\r\nI am not a type expert, but I need a
  good readable body copy font for 400-800 word articles written for and by teens.
  I would prefer to go with a san serif font.\r\n\r\nRight now, i am debating between
  Gotham, News Gothic and Calibri. What do you guys think would read and look the
  best for a teenage demographic? \r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks so
  much!\r\n\r\nFirst-time poster"

  body: I am utterly clueless about what would appeal to the LOL generation, but Calibri
    is probably the "warmest" of the three, and has the benefit of being included
    with Windows...

    teens, not pre-schoolers.\r\nDon't you think that a serifed type would be more
    appropriate for print (I presume) articles of this length?\r\nIf you're worried
    about it not looking young or trendy enough, it's not really the job of the text
    type to convey that quality -- although the way it's set does have some bearing
    on the matter.\r\n"

    here are some suggestions: Tisa, Dolly, Andulka, Brioni and Karmina. If you go
    with a sans, Sensibility is a much more interesting option than the three you
    referred."
