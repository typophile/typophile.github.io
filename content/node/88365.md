  is the first try-out for the brand communication of \"yello\", ....bright & warm
  :)\r\nThe idea is to portray the word as a single syllable rather than a color (metaphorically
  ie)\r\nThe target audience is \"middle-class .. mobile device users aged from 18
  onwards\", The usp\r\nof this brand is to celebrate one of the oldest & the most
  used art-form known to man: Speech.\r\n\r\nPlease do review the two variations\r\n\r\n\r\nPS:
  this might be insensitive to the minorities ( the mute ), .but I'll be considering
  them too once the first bit kicks off, ..\r\n\r\nthanks in adavnce\r\n-Dhyani"

  body: "I think you got the feeling in it, it just needs refinement. The 2nd Looks
    very friendly and warm. The sharp bit on the y on the first logo doesn't fit in
    with the friendliness of the rest. \r\n\r\nIn both versions the y is far too wide.
    The o looks a bit slanted to the right. 'Bright & warm' needs a different typeface
    and a larger size. A simple, clean typeface, with an open ampersand. The tails
    on the two l's could be a bit larger/longer IMO.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Can''t say this is much of a logo. I kind of like where you were headed on
    the talk bubble corner of the "y" in the first version. Have you tried applying
    this to the "O"? Or maybe putting the entire word inside of a speech bubble? '

  body: I agree with riccardo. I'd say give them an ever so slightly bend to the right
    and chop the tops off at an angle. Or something like that :-)

  body: "Mr is right, what the logo needs to pull it together is an encapsulating
    graphic, the speech bubble idea would work well. \r\n\r\nEven thought the the
    font style is right it just needs refining.\r\n\r\nBe careful with the y at the
    beginning of the word, as the descender tends to move your eye away from the word.
    In this case an upper case y could work better, Try moving lifting the letter
    up and reforming the stroke junction back down closer to the baseline. \r\n\r\nI
    agree with the  comments about the l's, try clipping the tops slightly as they
    do tend to break up the word."
