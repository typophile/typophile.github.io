body: Greetings, I need your help.  Greetings, <BR> <BR>I have been a huge fan of
  Cassady &amp; Greens Fluent Laser Fonts fort many years.  I purchased the set of
  diskettes with the Postscript, etc. fonts way back when and have been using them
  ever since.  As time went on I upgraded my Macs and now of course have no floppy
  drives. -- though I still have the diskettes.  <BR> <BR>I have been using Gazelle
  FLF as part of my header and still love that font as well as many others.  But as
  I copied fonts from one computer to another -- it now appears as GazelleFLF-fog.
  and just does not work any longer in the version of InDesign I am now using. <BR>
  <BR>I was so disappointed to discover that C&amp;G is no longer in business.  I
  am sad to seee that these fonts may be lost to the world.  I have been trying to
  find Gazelle in a TT font for the mac -- I am looking everywhere.  I hate to see
  this beautiful font no longer available -- can anyone help? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>
  <BR>David  &#40;<a href="mailto:drice4@ix.netcom.com">drice4@ix.netcom.com</a>&#41;

  body: If you could post a graphic sample of the font in the type identification
    area of this site, I&#39;m willing to bet someone could help you out. The font
    may exist under a different name or foundry. <BR> <BR>-Addison

  body: 'I actually have these fonts also. Can&#39;t remember when I used them last.
    One of the first &#34;collections&#34; we licensed back in the day, the day we
    switched to mac. Hehe. If you do have the original floppies, I would suggest heading
    to a local Kinko&#39;s &#40;or similar&#41; and re-copy from the orginal to a
    zip or cd which you can read on your machine. '

  body: I don&#39;t have those - but the topic peeked my interest. During my education,
    the typography teacher told us about one of the first sets, I want to say Charlemange,
    but I know that&#39;s not it - and now I can&#39;t remember, but she mentioned
    that she has never ever been able to find a visual of the typeface &#40;a career
    of about 20 years then&#41; and placed to us a challenge to find it. Its been
    over 5 years now that I&#39;ve known this, but I guess knowing the name would
    help eh?  - if I heard it I&#39;d probably remember again.  <BR> <BR>In any case
    its always been in the back of my mind - this original typeface lost to the world...must
    find. Anyone know what I&#39;m talking about and is there a visual somewhere?
    <BR> <BR>I know it starts with a C. <BR> <BR>To think a face is absolutely gone
    is odd isin&#39;t it. I heard that since Letraset stopped producing the transfers
    many faces are lapsing while they digitize only a select few. Scary thought, shouldn&#39;t
    there be a conservatory dept under the TDC, or FontBureau or something.
