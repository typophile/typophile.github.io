body: "Dear reader,\r\nI am looking for the right font for an Identity. I must me
  a little bit of a Vintage look font, not to serious, not to loose. Maybe something
  like Futura, only there is a J in the name and I prefer one with the curve, instead
  of straight down like Futura.\r\nIt also should have O's in the name.\r\nMaybe someone
  has tips?\r\n\r\nThanks "

  body: If you're looking for something like Futura, but with a curved lowercase "j",
    you may like Futura's cousin from behind the Iron Curtain, [[http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/super-grotesk|Super
    Grotesk]]. I think [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-text|Brandon
    Text]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-grotesque|Brandon Grotesque]]
    could be fine choices as well, maybe a bit overused as webfonts lately.

    a straight 'j' but may well be worth a look."
