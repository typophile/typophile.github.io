    adjust the spacing between the letters and possibly thing of other variations.

  body: You might consider reversing the color heirarchy. Try using the Green for
    the K and grey for the rest. Or just keep it all one color. It is very pleasant
    to look at. I like the serif face chosen. It kind of humanizes the logo. A san
    serif face wouldn&#39;t have such a beautiful {. Good type choice!

  body: Sergio-   <BR> <BR>Is there a particular programing language that &#39;{ is
    referencing &#40;such as html&#41; ?  It would be interesting to find a symbol
    or combination of symbols whose significance emphasizes your friend&#39;s position
    in the market place.  If you&#39;re not familiar with programing languages, you
    might ask your friend &#40;or look online&#41; for a list of programing symbols
    and their contextual meanings.  It be interesting to see this logo develop more
    conceptually.  <BR> <BR>Otherwise, I also like your choice of type and initial
    approach.

    users. Try separating the symbol from the name, then the end users will get it.

  body: 'I think the reason the &#39;{ is not reading as a letter is because it is
    not the same color as the rest of the letters, so it feels like a supporting mark.
    <BR> <BR>What you have now i would consider &#34;outside,&#34; so try to make
    it perfectly clear &#40;inside&#41; then work towards the middle to find something
    that&#39;s not bland, but not illegible.  <BR> <BR>I think keeping a consistent
    baseline is key, #1 in your 3:07 post is getting there. I think the &#34;cap height&#34;
    could use adjusting. Work the type like it&#39;s type, not like it&#39;s following
    the rules of computers, because in the end, if it reads well, we&#39;ll still
    get the &#40;very clever and cool&#41; idea behind i all. <BR> <BR>Rock it, it&#39;s

    think the italic is your strongest design. The version with the two pipes reads
    clearly as a K but part of what I liked so much about your original &#40;and #3
    of last posting&#41; is the ah-ha element of discovery. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious,
    How will this be used? I would assume on stationary and business cards. In that
    case try designing the entire card or letterhead. It may give you the opportunity
    to further explain the logo, and not require such a clear K.'

    ah-ha nature of the K works with this mark.  If it was for a computer company
    or a lawyer, then maybe not, but no doubt it will almost always be used with the
    programmers contact information, Kenzen...so the connection will be made.  AND
    people will LOOK for the connection, which is exactly what you would want a mark

    they can read it. I see the K but, then again, you told us what it was supposed
    to be before we saw the mark. <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t try to tie it to any specific
    programming  language...as most programmers aren&#39;t tied to one specific language.
    <BR> <BR>Maybe just try some other characters? Perhaps a ]{ <BR> <BR>I like Galin&#39;s
    1{, though perhaps that&#39;s a bit too script-kiddie-ish. <BR> <BR>Perhaps try
    a monospaced typeface?

  body: Maybe you should try altering the bracket, as you would alter any other letter
    to make a point in your logotype. Curl it up a little more at the bottom, or lose
    the curl at the top, or raise the center. If making any of these alterations makes
    it unidentifiable as a bracket, then maybe you can simply find a way to effectively
    superimpose an actual &#34;K&#34; behind the bracket &#40;e.g. outline, screen&#41;.

    it should definitely stay on the same baseline as a &#39;K&#39; would. <BR> <BR>I
    like the lower righthand version above, though I miss the openness of the first
    one. I think the delicate nature of the mark calls for some looser tracking.
