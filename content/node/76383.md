  having a book printed, and have absolutely no clue about foil stamping cloth covers.
  What is meant by one vs. two or three stamps? Is this for different colors, different
  sides of the book, the size of the stamp? And how detailed can a foil stamp be?
  Is it best to stay away from fine lines, or can I pretty much do whatever I want?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBEH"

    may cut the cloth..."

    to Nick\u2019s caution about cutting the cloth, in general fine lines and details
    cannot be reliably held in stamped foil. In my experience, it is like extreme
    ink gain. The smaller you go, the less detail you can hold.\r\n\r\nYou should
    definitely talk to your binder about their parameters and any recommendations. "

    in my experience is a maybe. There are presses out there that can stamp both covers
    and spine at once. A larger plate and press will cost more to set-up; for smaller
    runs it may be more economical to have the front and back stamped separately.\r\n\r\nThere
    are some good videos of the process up, for example http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DQH2AdcgZM."
