body: "I know \"Space Escapade\" is hand lettered. I love drawing stuff like that
  myself. But what about the sans? At first look I thought it was nothing special
  but then realised the S looks a bit warped. Is it a photolettering distortion? Could
  it be hand lettered? (From my own drawings of letters I know s can be awkward.)
  Is it just my eyes?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Les_Baxter_4794.jpg]"

  body: Thanks Mark. It has a rather eccentric C as well as the odd S. It is the proportions
    of the B, E and R that I really like.
