body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm currently considering embarking on a typeface design
  project (just for fun). I could do with some advice: \r\n\r\n1. Could any books
  be recommended that detail how to draw type?\r\n\r\n2. What tools would I need to
  initially hand draw type? Is a pica ruler useful and would I need a set-square/protractor/compass
  etc.? I would really love to know of any tools that would be particularity useful
  for hand drawing/designing a typeface. My eventual aim would be to digitise it should
  it go well, but for now I'd love some advice on books and tools.\r\n\r\nWith thanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJoe\r\n\r\n\r\n"
