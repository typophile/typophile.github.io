  find my notes. The encoding settings in FontLab 4.6 are suddenly confusing. Can
  someone offer some simple steps for encoding? Which encodings are people using for
  Mac & PC, TT and T1? How necessary is it to include multiple code pages?\r\n\r\nWith
  some encoding settings, Font Book will accept my MacTT font, but others not -- I
  can't seem to find a pattern using Adobe encoding or MacOS Roman, with the generate
  options checked or not. Help...!\r\n\r\n"

    I've found works well in OS X is to generate a (OpenType) font, and drag it into
    my \"user > library > fonts\" folder. When ready, trash that and drag in the next
    version (same naming and font info). InDesign responds immediately to the revised
    font."
