body: "When I was in grade school my second grade teacher had this chalk holder. I
  was wood with about, I'd say, six metal clips for holding chalk. It was a way for
  her to make lines on the chalkboard to teach us proper ascending and descending
  heights for our letters. I thought if anyone would remember this it would be a fellow
  font lover. I would love to get my hands on one for the chalkboard wall in my apartment!
  Anyone have any idea what this tool is called and where I may be able to find one?\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much in advance,\r\nErin Z"

    to create a musical staff on a chalkboard. So some inquiries with music teachers
    (or on musicophile.com ;-) ) might lead somewhere.\r\n\r\nEdit: googling \"music
    staff liner\" gives some results, e.g. [[http://www.wwbw.com/Grossman-Music-Chalkboard-Staff-Liner-910017-i1160451.wwbw|this
    thing]]."
