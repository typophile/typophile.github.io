  body: "The IPA Extensions, Phonetic Extensions and Latin Extended-D are not small
    caps proper, they just happen to have the same design as small caps proper. Or
    said in other words the design of these characters was appropriated from proper
    small caps, but the semantic link to small caps proper is broken and replaced
    with something else. The context of use will show which of the two they are.\r\n\r\nProper
    small caps do not have Unicode code-points."

  body: "Small caps are a stylistic variant of the standard alphabet. They do not
    require a separate unicode value. Small caps refer to the base letter and are
    accounted for in the opentype feature code which is part of the font. The feature
    code spells out that the normal glyphs (usually defined in a class) are substituted
    by the smallcap glyphs (usually defined in another class) when the \"smallcaps\"
    feature is selected by the user.\r\nBold and italic have no separate unicode value
    either. They also just present the same letter in a different style. Bold and
    italic do not require feature code, however, since they reside in their own separate
    font.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Everybody but Chris is being quite succinct.\r\n\r\nWhat helped me understand
    the decision was the glyph/character distinction. A *glyph* is a particular rendering.
    So the glyph *A* is different in Times than in Helvetica (or in any other font),
    but they are the same character. A Latin *A*, is a different character than a
    Greek *Alpha*, but within a single font, they are often the same glyph. \"Small\"
    capitals as a stylistic variant are taken to be the same character as \"regular\"
    capitals, hence have no separate codepoint. That they are small does not change
    the meaning of the text -- except for \"languages\" such as phonetics where they
    have a different meaning, hence need a codepoint."
