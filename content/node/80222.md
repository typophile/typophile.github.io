body: "Hello there , I'm a design student currently working on a project in which
  I am aiming to create a logo type for placebo medication.\r\nI have hit a wall and
  would like feedback to help me develop my designs. \r\nI am currently working on
  a stencil logo type\r\nbased on the rounded type that is stamped onto pills & capsules
  (see ref1)\r\nI started with quite a light typeface made of two sections ( to represent
  the pyschological & physiological aspects of medicine that work together ) \r\n\r\nMy
  tutor suggested to thicken it up , using the omnipresent helvetica as a reference.\r\ni've
  tried this but now it just looks (for want of a better phrase) ' sausage-y '\r\nillegible
  would probably be a more relevant phrase to use, but i'm sure you will understand.\r\n\r\nany
  help or suggestions for further development would be greatly appreciated, thanks\r\n"

    or heavy industrial settings).\r\nIf you want to maintain the two sections idea,
    what about just a white horizontal line through the word?"

  body: Does the logo need to reflect the fact it is a <em>placebo</em>, i.e. a dummy?
    Or are you just aiming at capturing the contours of a pill?

    in half a tablet. '

  body: "good question apankrat, \r\nThe project started with creating a superscript
    glyph that was supposed to represent the idea of a placebo , \r\n\r\nhttp://farm6.static.flickr.com/5259/5543332045_e6df7cd072.jpg\r\n\r\nI
    created this P+ symbol , as an alternative to the Rx symbol used on prescriptions\r\nwhich
    would be used when placebo's were prescribed\r\n\r\nso i guess i'm still quite
    hung up on the contours of the pill. \r\nI wanted something that was a modern
    alternative to helvetica but with a medical/pharmacutical connotation\r\ndo you
    think I just barking up the wrong tree with this pill influenced type?\r\n\r\n&
    cheers for the advice riccard0 I much prefer the horizontal cut into the type
    , it looks alot more consistant than before."

    search just now, very nice\r\nI really like that the different styles are defined
    in mili grams, a nice touch\r\nnot too sure about the lowercase 'a' though, it
    looks too sharp\r\n\r\nI was thinking of using gravur condensed as a body text\r\n&

  body: I think it might be a fairer test of your idea if the separations were not
    so wide. I see an F before I see a P in the name, and so on. ?? And thinner may
    be better to avoid the 55 gallon drum industrial look!

  body: Have you thought about altering the caps at the intersection? Those are what
    make it look sausage-y I think. Also I like what you did with the 'e' in the third
    draft, maybe you could do something similar with the 'a'?

    it being a placebo, and emphasizing that, as emphasizing that it''s a placebo
    seems to conflict with the definition of what a placebo is. '

  body: "I'm confused about your assignment. Are you designing a logo to be stamped
    onto pills and capsules? They don't put logos on those, they just put identification
    codes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you're designing a logo for marketing purposes
    (to be put on a label or in an an advertisement) I don't know why you'd pick a
    utilitarian stencil font. The fact that it somewhat resembles the codes stamped
    on pills seems totally irrelevant to me.  The codes on pills are so tiny that
    most folks can barely read them anyway, and they certainly aren't designed to
    convey anything about the product except factual data.\r\n\r\nThe whole point
    of a placebo is to fool the patient into thinking they're getting real medicine,
    rather than a sugar pill, so you'd want a logo that looked very similar to traditional
    prescription logos.\r\n"
