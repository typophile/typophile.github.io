body: I bought some fonts from fontbureau &#40;Prensa - great font&#41;. The problem
  is that they are listed as seperate fonts in graphics programs - i.e. PrensaBold
  PrensaBoldItalic etc. <BR> <BR>Fonts I&#39;ve bought from other places &#40;MyFonts
  and FontFont&#41; don&#39;t have this problem. Is there any way I can correct the
  fonts on my machine without violating some sort of agreement so that they are all
  listed under one title? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance...

  body: I assue that style names are part of the family name, a solution some foundries
    use to avoid Windows&#39; four-styles-per-family restriction. <BR> <BR>Do you
    regard this as a problem? <BR> <BR>At best you ask FontBureau if their EULA allows
    font modifications, and maybe they can make the changes for you?

  body: Right. Thanks for that. I didn&#39;t know that Windows imposed such a restriction.
    Will get on to FontBureau. <BR> <BR>By the way, above issue aside, FB were quick
    to process my order and they have some very nice fonts. Give them a go!
