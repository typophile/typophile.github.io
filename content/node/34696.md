  fonts of their letters or were those letters drawn by hand?

    forms to print. With 'spacers' I mean the blocks normally used to tighten a printing
    forme on the press. Look at the work of De Stijl for example.\r\nI'm not sure
    how those are called in English, since it's not my native tongue. :)"

    folks who were influenced by them like Bauhaus & De Stijl etc.\r\n\r\nMaybe also
    helpful:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/18503\r\n\r\nAlso, have you looked at
    the precusrsor to Constructivist stuff : Futurism? Futurism had an Italian as
    well as a Russian branch. They are clearly related in some key ways.\r\n\r\n"

    in the lettering, so the lack of any manufactured fonts explains it."

  body: "AFAIK, fonts were not produced during the era of heroic communism (too bourgeois).\r\nIn
    the famous Constructivist posters, book covers and magazines, they used exisiting
    fonts for small scale typography, and lettered the larger stuff themselves --
    as was common practice elsewhere during the teens, 20s and 30s. Remember, that
    photolettering (typositor) had not been introduced even in the West then, and
    the best \"pre-made\" type for headlines was wood, and a bit rough anyway. So
    if you wanted nice big lettering, you made original artwork, and that was true
    whether you were working in the capitalist West and wanted some neo-Renaissance
    thang, or were a Soviet radical."

    Type</em></a> mentions that this movement's alphabets were created as handlettering,
    too -- Middendorp mentions the work of Vilmos Husz\xE1r and Bart van der Leck,
    as well as Theo van Doesburg (pages 78\u201380, \"De Stijl, Constructivism and
    the New Typography\")."

    but maybe this included only collage on posters, drawing, lettering on the image,
    book design etc. \r\nMaybe you should check within Vkhutemas, the school."

  body: "I once noticed some variations in the lettering (and I do believe it is lettering,
    not type) produced by [[Alexander Rodchenko]] and was surprised to notice how
    much variation was there. In the same line of text the width of a given character
    varied by as much as 20 percent (based on my non-scientific assessment).\r\n\r\nMy
    own conclusion: type was a rich part of the posters, but a secondary detail, kind
    of like movie stars' teeth in the 1970s. =)\r\n\r\nI've since thought that making
    a Rodchenko font that is true to his hand would be tough to pull off. How do you,
    with today's reproduction fidelity, stay true to his variation and warmth of his
    lettering. I think it would look too mechanical or canned."

  body: Joe, nevertheless, your comment raises the question of what Rodchenko's lettering/type
    would look like if he had today's tools at his disposal. (I know, I know -- it
    might be pointless to speculate on "what if..." questions.)
