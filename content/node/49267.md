  body: "Most are not typefaces, but rather hand drawn logos, or fonts modified to
    become logos. \r\n\r\nThe last specimen may be a font, but I don't know it.  Someone
    will though. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: The Body Shop logo is probably based on Gill Sans - the O is custom.

  body: As previously noted by David Berlow, most of these logos are either completely
    custom or modifications of existing typefaces. The m may have been modified, borrowed
    from another typeface, or drawn from scratch.
