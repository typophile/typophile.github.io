  body: "You'll have to read the EULA specific to the fonts in question, but:\r\n\r\n1)
    Mac OS X (at least from v 10.3 on up) can use PC Truetype and Opentype fonts without
    reformatting. I think PC PostScript fonts work too, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\n2)
    Windows XP (and consequently most compatible software) can run on Mac hardware,
    either with Virtual PC on PowerPC models, or with Boot Camp on the newer MacIntel
    models.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have your software all installed on the same machine,
    you should be allowed to use all your fonts on that machine, even if they are
    used between multiple operating systems, unless the font's EULA specifically or
    implicitly excludes this sort of use.\r\n\r\n"
