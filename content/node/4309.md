body: As a lark I&#39;m  making my own fake dictionary entries in Photoshop. For authenticity&#39;s
  sake I&#39;m trying to use all the pronunciation symbols &#40;&amp;#601; [schwa],
  &amp;#331; [ng], etc.&#41; and finding a font that has full support is frustrating.  Right
  now I&#39;m just using Times New Roman, but it&#39;s not quite right, though it
  has support for some of the symbols. Anyone know any better fonts out there to make
  a good Oxford English Dictionary spoof?
