body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\ncan anybody help me identifying this font? I seems so familiar
  but I really can't pin it down to one font.\r\nIt looks a bit like FF Dax, but apparently
  it's not. The lowercase \"p\" should give it away, but I can't find anything exactly
  like this.\r\nStarting to believe it's a custom type.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help
  :)\r\nTom"
