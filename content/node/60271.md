  1.5 years of not always intense labor the release of Calluna is a fact. Be sure
  to have a look at the PDF specimen. Hope you like it!\r\n\r\nIt's available at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/|MyFonts.com]]."

    The directional serifs work so well with the spiky serifs. And the result is not
    distracting at all, very easy to read.\r\n\r\nSecond, the two Rumi poems in the
    specimen are priceless. Wonderful way to show off Calluna's love for poetry. And
    not just any poetry, but poetry from one of the greatest poets who ever lived,
    East or West.\r\n\r\nThird, your talent is unstoppable. I haven't met a typeface
    of yours I didn't like. Your work is worth far more than you charge for it.\r\n\r\nThank

    I think they sit very nicely, better than most, the sameness with the i dot is

  body: "This is a wonderful font, probably one of the most beautiful text fonts I've
    seen, beautiful enough to be a reason to register here for this comment. ;)\r\nIt
    is not too far away from the caption/face (german: Schriftbild), of Times in a
    way. It follows the x-height and letter shape, but is rounder where needed, like
    with the c, u and o, and overall wider, which is nice :) . Plus it is of course
    less \"modern\" in the sense of the horizontal and vertical \"broadness\" of the
    letters (sorry not an expert, don't know the term), but looks of course fresher
    with the twist you put on it with the upwards inclined lines to create the flow,
    and leaving aside the drops and things that would make it look to classic. Not
    sure if your \"inclined direction\" is the reason why it flows, but it works overall
    perfectly.\r\nIn a way it achieves what Gentium and Lido don't achieve, to be
    a Times with a human touch and look good with it. Lido looks like a Comic font
    too me ;) well a bit.\r\nSorry for the comparison to Times, but I mean it in a
    good way ;) cause Times is a good font, but it is obviously born long time ago,
    it is just too modern, too narrow, too traditional. To me, Calluna is a great
    font of its own. :)\r\n\r\n"
