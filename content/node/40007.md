  typeface \xBBAngelina\xAB extended with some missing characters. They downloaded
  it from one of the \"free font\" websites., such as this one here:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/search.php?psize=m&q=Angelina\r\nThe
  license and designer info in the font does not contain any information about who
  designed it or to what conditions it my be used or licensed. Can anyone here tell
  who is the designer of this font?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAlbert-Jan Pool"

    or designer's name, and they have tried to locate it -- then it is up for anyone
    to use.\r\n\r\nSince you are a profession and want the proper permission, then
    maybe you can find something \"legal\" to substitute. There are many great handwriting
    fonts these days.\r\n\r\nIn my searching I came across this conversation on the
    very same topic\r\nhttp://ask.metafilter.com/52509/IS-Angelinattf-really-a-freeware-font\r\n\r\nIf
    we believe what is written then this font is really named Angie and was used exclusively
    for a greeting card company -- and you know, there is no reason to doubt that
    - happens all the time."
