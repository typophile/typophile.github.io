  it in photoshop. The letters with accents don&#39;t show up, everything else does.
  He uses a spanish windows platform and the font is a ttf. He also has a friend who
  uses the same windows and the same photoshop and it works for the friend. I don&#39;t
  know which version of photoshop the guy&#40;and his friend&#41; have, sorry. Can
  anyone give me any help at all on what might be the problem &#40;even if it&#39;s
  refering to another post i missed&#41;. thanks ahead of time. <BR>-phillip cavette '
