  body: "I've seen them in specimens, but never in use.\r\nIn the documentary on Frutiger
    Next, Adrian Frutiger does a quick sketch of the oldstyle figures (in which he
    makes a mistake on \"4\"), which Akira Kobayashi implements (fixing the mistake).\r\nSo
    I don't think the designer's heart was in it (really, it's a feature made to accommodate
    Adobe layout apps and the OpenType format), and a bit of a travesty for this modern
    typeface."

    style' figures look more 'natural' within blocks of text on a page.\r\n\r\nBut,
    that's my opinion :)"

    has a descender was standing on the baseline; the 4, I think."

    though they may be, don't you find the oldstyle figures quaint in proportion and
    busy in comparison to the sublimely modern reduction of the alphabetic characters?"
