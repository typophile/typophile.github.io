body: "I'm pretty new to all this and am working on my first typeface. I've been adding
  new weights and now have a family of 4 weights.\r\n\r\nI noticed something odd the
  other day: a lot of the OpenType scripts & features seem to have changed a bit (im
  not even sure how i am supposed to call these, i mean the classes, salt, calt, dlig
  features, and so on).\r\n\r\nFor example, there is suddenly an aalt feature:\r\n<i>feature
  aalt{\r\n  feature salt;\r\n} aalt; </i>\r\n\r\nIn the liga feature there are suddenly
  comments such as \r\n<i># Standard Ligatures\r\n # Latin</i>\r\n\r\ncalt suddenly
  has 'lookup' in it:\r\n<i>lookup calt2 { </i>\r\n\r\nand so on a number of other
  changes.\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure what happened. It seems a number of kerning
  details I did have been lost as well. \r\n\r\nOn top of this (maybe this is the
  problem?) when I generate the font I get a pop-up window that says:\r\n\r\n<i>\"Current
  font contains both OpenType features definition and imported binary OpenType tables\"</i>\r\n\r\nCould
  it be that I have unknowingly opened the .otf files I generated and continued working
  on those, saving them again as .vfb files? Is that possible at all? I noticed that
  it is possible to open up .otf files and those do have that aalt feature that I
  didn't put in there myself.\r\n\r\nSuggestions more than welcome!\r\n\r\nPS: any
  tips on how to save older versions of your typeface in progress? Because if this
  went haywire I'll probably have to start over again since I continuously over-saved
  the files... ;("

  body: Once more, I cannot claim any special expertise in the matter, but I have
    noticed that FontLab has its own ideas about what constitutes proper syntax, and
    will apply those ideas when it generates a font. Unless the syntax you use is
    spectacularly wrong, the process is transparent.

  body: "Actually, I think it's better to characterize the process in reverse. What
    you're seeing has more to do with how FontLab <em>de</em>compiles fonts than how
    it compiles them. When FL compiles a font, you should end up with something which
    contains the features and lookups which you described in your .vfb file, but there
    is no way to recover the actual code which your .vfb file contained simply by
    looking at the resultant .otf file. FontLab can't reconstruct things like class
    or lookup names from compiled fonts so it makes these up, and it also explicitly
    includes a lot of stuff which is often left implicit when writing code (such as
    lookup declarations).\r\n\r\nIf you really want to know exactly what FontLab is
    generating, you're better off using a tool like DTL OTMaster (Lite) rather than
    reopening your fonts in FontLab.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Thanks for your replies guys. This already helps me a lot to understand what's
    going on.\r\n\r\nAm I correct in assuming that I did in fact open up the wrong
    files then? That is, that I accidentally opened up the .oft files instead of the
    build files? (while i had those .vfb files right there in the same directory).
    And that FontLab then reverse engeneered / recompiled the fonts from my .otf files
    into new .vfb files that I - stupidly - saved again over my original .vfb files
    - hence loosing the original files?\r\n\r\nThis probably means that I can't get
    my old files back with the original code. Not that it really matters that the
    code is different - but there seem to be a few oddities now. And on top of that
    there is this <i>\"Current font contains both OpenType features definition and
    imported binary OpenType tables\"</i> message...'\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I can't be sure, but yes, it sounds like that's what you did.\r\n\r\nThe
    message is asking you whether you want to preserve the original (imported binary)
    opentype feature definitions (the ones which were created by FontLab when you
    originally exported the font) or if you want to recompile the features using the
    source code created by FontLab's decompiler.\r\n\r\nWhile OpenType source code
    refers to glyphs by name, in the actual OpenType tables glyphs are referred to
    by glyph index. Therefore, you should only use the imported binary features if
    you haven't done anything which might have reordered the glyphs within the font.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    messages elsewhere to prefer the binary over the other option, but it is very
    good to know that I shouldn't mess around with the glyph order anymore. Thanks!\r\n\r\nBy
    the way: is it possible to copy/paste the complete kerning code from one font
    to another? Say from my regular version to my bold version? The index is the same
    so I'm guessing that should work just fine?"

    is turned on). How is that possible? These swash characters should only show themselves
    if there isn't another glyph in place before the character (@calt1 = basically
    all glyphs)."

    in the contextual alternates list, which is why I put them in the stylistic feature...

  body: "Oh, good.\r\n\r\nTwo suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. You can save yourself a lot of
    trouble with regard to font caches if you give your fonts provisional names while
    under development, changing them each time you generate a new version. For example,
    if your font is called \"My Font\", you might have development versions called
    \"My Font A\", \"My Font B\", \"My Font C\" and so on. This also has the advantage
    that you can compare different versions side by side in applications. But the
    best thing is that it completely avoids the font cache issues. (Note: I'm talking
    about the name you give the font in the Font Info dialogs, not the file name of
    the font file, which has no effect on the font name in the operating system or
    applications.)\r\n\r\n2. Your code could be a bit simpler. Since you already have
    a class called \"@STARTSWASH\", you could save yourself some typing by doing this:\r\n\r\n<pre>feature
    salt { # Stylistic Alternates\r\n# Latin\r\n@STARTSWASH = [K R V W Q A];\r\n@STARTSWASH_ALT
    = [K.alt R.alt V.alt W.alt Q.alt A.alt];\r\nignore sub @calt1 @STARTSWASH';\r\nsub
    @STARTSWASH' by @STARTSWASH_ALT;\r\n} salt;</pre>\r\n\r\nIt's shorter and a bit
    clearer what's going on."

    Font Info dialog will also be a good trick to use for my next typeface, that'll
    save me loads of time restarting both the machine and Illustrator/Photoshop.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
