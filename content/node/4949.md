  counters. I&#39;ve looked at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/california-grotesk/urw-t-black/testdrive.html?s=ROBERT%2BREHME&amp;p=48"
  target="_blank">California Grotesk</a> and Compacta <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/compacta/bold/testdrive.html?s=ROBERT%2BREHME%2B%2BS&amp;p=72"
  target="_blank">Compacta</a> but they don&#39;t have the stoke variation or the
  super fat &#40;ultra bold&#41; weight I&#39;m looking for. This looks like I&#39;ve
  seen it everywhere but there&#39;s nothing in my specimen books or anywhere on myfonts.com.
  This doesn&#39;t seem to be manipulated but I&#39;ve been wrong before. I&#39;ve
  tried the &#34;more fonts like this&#34;. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t work at nights anymore.
  Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s sample:  <BR><img
