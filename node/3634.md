body: Here&#39;s a font ID request I received today, and I have drawn a blank. Anyone
  know this one? Something looks familiar about the d and g, but I&#39;m not finding
  it. Font Fonts? &#40;couldn&#39;t find it at T-26, which was my first impulse&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Any help appreciated.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28730.gif"
