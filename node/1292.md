body: Here&#39;s a Typophile-only link to check out a sneak peek of DEFCON, our first
  retail release. The actual release won&#39;t happen for about a month. <BR> <BR>www.apollo26.com/DEFKON/index.html
  <BR> <BR>The link is not to be reposted anywhere permanent because it&#39;s going
  to expire at 2 a.m. PST. <BR>The goodies, PDF, pricing and buy links have been disabled.
  We are going to be using KAGI for e-commerce. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to hear feedback,
  but what I really WANT is criticism. Yes. This sneak preview is only here at Typophile
  so please be critical. This will help IMPROVE the final product. If you miss it
  today, email me <A HREF="mailto:bjharvey@apollo26.com">bjharvey@apollo26.com</A>
  and I can give you a fresh link. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve already shown this to some people
  and received a lot of questions, so I&#39;ll just answer a few. <BR> <BR>WHAT&#39;S
  A DESIGN KIT? <BR>This is answered in the intro. Essentially, a Design Kit is a
  collection of Digital Elements. <BR> <BR>WHO IS THIS FOR? WHO&#39;S GOING TO BUY
  THIS STUFF? <BR>We have in mind a bunch of different demographics that could use
  our Design Elements and we will target those people within the next month, at least
  to make them aware of our product. Having worked in and around the Action Sports
  Industry &#40;surf, skate, moto, etc&#41;, this promises to be our most interested
  demographic. But we realize that this stuff is not for everyone. We are at work
  on several more Design Kits, including Musica Electronica, Bad Ass Mofo, and Made
  in Japan. Our niche is a counter-culture niche. <BR> <BR>WHERE DID YOU GET THE PICTURES?
  <BR>We took them. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">
  Now what to do with all these gasmasks? The vector art was created from scratch
  as were the fonts. A third vector technician has also joined us and is working on
  some of the other Design Kits. <BR> <BR>WHY ONLY 199 DESIGN KITS? <BR>We&#39;d like
  to make them 1&#41; available and 2&#41; scarce. <BR> <BR>HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO
  COST? <BR>We have a pricing structure in mind, but we&#39;d love to hear suggestions.  <BR>
  <BR>WHAT EXACTLY IS INCLUDED? <BR>Everything you see plus some more stuff, and sounds
  that we created on our Korg synth. <BR>We&#39;ll have a complete list intact when
  we launch Apollo 26. <BR> <BR> <BR>WHY ALL THE FLASH MOTION? <BR>We could show everything
  static but we didn&#39;t want tiny gifs. I don&#39;t know how rampant piracy is,
  but we wanted to give the copycats a moving target. The Flash movies aren&#39;t
  exactly Mike Cina quality, but they are a start. <BR> <BR>THE FLASH MOVIES RUN REALLY
  SLOW OR REALLY FAST ON MY MACHINE <BR>We are trying to find a happy medium. For
  computers with processors &#62;500 mhz, the Flash movies go to0 fast. We need to
  space out some areas where the text appears too fast. If you have anything below
  an iMac, I&#39;d love to hear how your computer handles the Flash. We haven&#39;t
  yet tested in an OSX platform, but I would guess that it would speed it up. It actually
  was built on a Mac, but runs better on Windows. <BR> <BR>ARE THE FONTS GOING to
  feature a full character set? <BR>Yes. <BR> <BR>DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH
  9/11? <BR>There are no specific 9/11 references, it&#39;s more our Elemental take
  on the state of our world. <BR> <BR>WHAT DOES THE WORD &#39;DEFCON&#39; REFER TO?
  <BR>Defcon is the Defense Condition of our country, referred to in numbers ranging
  from 1 to 5. <BR> <BR>IS THIS A NEGATIVE TAKE? <BR>We couldn&#39;t be more positive
  that it&#39;s not intended to be negative, these are just design elements and we
  happen to be very positive people, with occasional visions of bad things. <BR> <BR>
  <BR>bj <BR> <BR> <BR>By the way, as you can see we are keeping the name. CS was
  nice and wished us good luck.

  body: ' Hey BJ, <BR> <BR>It&#39;s really a very engaging interface and a great way
    to present your design kit. Since you&#39;re looking for critique, here&#39;s
    my take . . . <BR> <BR>For the average consumer who doesn&#39;t have the benefit
    of your post to read, you never actually come out and &#39;show&#39; or explain
    the whole kit which I can imagine is an impressive gathering. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    like to see the design kit sold in a metal spy or military suitcase with a black
    spongy foam lining that has holes cut out for a CD case, the shrink wrapped tee
    with the biohazard sticker sealing the bag, and a printed laminated &#39;manual&#39;
    just to name a few . . . <BR> <BR>The entire demonstration is great but it lacks
    real call to action that would get people to make a purchase. Show &#39;em the
    entire kit, explain the pieces, present the price, make sure you spell out in
    the animation before you show any elements that this kit comes with &#39;X&#39;
    clip art elements, THEN show the clip art . . . <BR> <BR>Check out www.houseind.com
    - they show the kit, the tee, the vector art, the fonts and engage you to place
    an order, that&#39;s ideally what you would want to present to your audience to
    make some sales. . . <BR> <BR>The only long term problem I forsee is you will
    still need a uniquly branded Apollo26.com website that features AND promotes each
    design kit. You DO want your audience to know that DEFCON is the name of one of
    your products, NOT your company . . . <BR> <BR>Otherwise, I can&#39;t wait to
    see the final release! Good work so far! <BR>Stuart :D '

  body: ' Stuart, thanks for the feedback and great ideas. <BR> <BR>Just to clarify,
    the DEFCON interface is going to pop-up from the DESIGN KITS portion of the Apollo
    26 site, which is still being constructed. <BR> <BR>A few things: the collector&#39;s
    tin packaging is going to be screened with a red UPC/stars logo &#40;its one of
    the first images in the intro&#41;, but we haven&#39;t taken the product shots.
    The spongy lining is a good idea. Actually, the closest thing to one of those
    cool boxes is a photographer&#39;s box. The lowest wholesale price we saw was
    $18.00. Out of our price range, but our Made In Japan Design Kit is going to come
    in an old school metal lunchbox. <BR> <BR>Yeah, we&#39;re going to outline everything
    that people get...on the PDF and Goodies pages. I disabled those because they
    are incomplete. We&#39;re a ways off, but thought I&#39;d get some initial feedback.
    July 26 is actually too soon. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions on pricing? And the 199
    figure? <BR> <BR>bj '
