  to say that this month's video is an \"outside broadcast\" - I filmed it in York
  city centre, in Dean's Park in the grounds of the historical Gothic cathedral known
  as the \"Minster.\"\r\n\r\nFans of bird-song may also be interested - they seemed
  to be in good voice throughout the filming!\r\n\r\nThere's been plenty of new and
  interesting material added to the site during April.\r\n\r\nClick the link below
