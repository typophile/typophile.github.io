  is the right place to ask. But I am interested in knowing more about typography.
  I am wondering if anyone know a place to visit around San Francisco area to know
  more about typography?\r\n\r\nWarm Regards,\r\n\r\nJohn"

    Both how to make and use it.\r\nhttp://www.arionpress.com/\r\n\r\nFontshop in
    SF should also be able to supply you with some good information.\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/contact/\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

    an iron hand press and full printing rig. Darn! I forget the ship's name and maybe
    the press isn't even there any longer. Check with some of the SF Typophiles about
    this.\r\n\r\nThe Book Club of California has a really rich library of California
    typography & printing. As does the Bancroft Library across the bay in Berkeley
    at the university.\r\n\r\nSF public library also has great collections.\r\n\r\nThe
    University of San Francisco is threatening to de-accession much of their library.
    Get out there soon to the special collections room. Lots of rarely-seen Eric Gill
    stuff.\r\n\r\nIf I still had my letterpress shop there I'd invite you for a visit.
    But that's a long time ago.\r\n\r\nHave fun. Dress warmly, particularly around
    the wharf. & alert the folks at home that you may never come back once you've
    got SF fever. That happens to a lot of people.\r\n\r\npowers"

    contacting them. I am quite amazed though they put their cell numbers there.\r\n\r\nStefan
    H:\r\nArion Press seems like a good place to visit. Now, only if I can have some
    excuse to take a day off from work... Hmmmm!!\r\n\r\nFontshop website seems to
    have a lot of information too. Though, I can't find anywhere in their website
    whether they are open for a visit.\r\n\r\nwill powers:\r\nSF is beautiful - I
    think I got the fever already. Thanks for letting me know those libraries. Book
    of California so far seems to be the most promising :D"

    in the Special Collections department will show you special and rare items if
    you are clear about what you are looking for. It''s on the top floor.'
