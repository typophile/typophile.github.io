    odd. they are similar to Bisque Bold by Letterbox, but several characters of Bisque
    are significantly different from your sample.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jonahfonts/georgie/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jonahfonts/annabel-lee/"

  body: "Jodie, Georgie has many more styles than Annabel Lee, and looking at the
    \"Glyph coverage\" icons it seems that it additionally has some OpenType features
    and smallcaps. And it's only $3 more (per style). But neither one of those is
    super close to the sample.\r\n\r\nBisque: I doubt Georgie / Annabel Lee is derived
    from that. That said, the Jonahfonts library <em>does</em> happen to make me mildly
    uneasy - but I'd have to look closer to have something to really complain about.\r\n\r\nChris,
    I'm just going by the designer's own admission here:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=zebra_110\r\nSee
    in particular the last comment (2/25/2010).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
