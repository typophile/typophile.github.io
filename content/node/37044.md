  build websites on the side - and I was wondering if anyone could tell me the font
  http://similicio.us uses as there logo font. I love the clean simple look - love
  the 'u'.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n~Andy"

    code of the website. That font is <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/147488/centurygothic-family.html\">Century
    Gothic.</a>\r\n\r\nEileen\r\n\r\n"

    Trebuchet.

  body: "True - and if no Trebuchet, then Arial Narrow and so on down the code: \r\n\r\n<em>font-family:\"Century
    Gothic\", \"Trebuchet MS\", \"Arial Narrow\", Arial, sans-serif;</em>\r\n\r\nIt's
    also not a logo, by the way, but that's a whole different discussion. \r\n\r\nEileen\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "It's easy. The source code on similicio.us references a css style sheet in
    this line:\r\n\r\n<em> link href=\"sim.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"
    \ </em>\r\n\r\nSo, simply add sim.css to the end of the url, like this:\r\n\r\n<em>http://similicio.us/sim.css</em>\r\n\r\nThen,
    find the \"h1\" style attributed to the font you're looking for. \r\n\r\nViola!
