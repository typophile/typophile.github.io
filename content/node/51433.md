body: "I just saw last night's 'Have I got news from you' & I was laughing out loud
  at a story in the connections round where a radio presenter was said to have confused
  a font name (Helvetica bold) for a person's name. Searching the internet to read
  more about this, I came across an article that stated 'Helvetica Bold' was actually
  the listener's nickname which kind of burst my bubble of anyone being that ignorant
  about what must be one of the most used & known fonts.\r\nBut it's still fun to
  watch & I wanted to share it nonetheless\u2026\r\nhttp://blogs.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/ianwylie/2008/11/helvetica_bold.html"

    It's certainly not that common :-)
