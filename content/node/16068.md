  I'm seeking feedback/critique/suggestions on this logo I'm creating for an industrial
  machine company in New England.\r\nThey are looking for something that says \"patriotic\"
  and \"old New England\".\r\nI'm pretty happy with my work-in-progress, although
  I'm not quite sold on the font yet.\r\nI've been a working designer for about 5
  years, but I'm the first to admit typography is not my forte, although I am facinated
  with it, hense my interest in the Typophile site.\r\nI guess what I'm looking for
  is \"that perfect font\" (hey, who isn't?!) to fit this situation. As I mentioned,
  it needs to say \"old New England\". Yet it also needs to be condensed, or at least
  very narrow, as  I'm happy with the proportions of the flag to the type as it is
  now.\r\nMaybe my chosen font is okay? If so, feel free to say that as well!\r\nAs
  a point of interest, the flag I've created is basically a combination of the \"unofficial\"
  New England flags of the revolutionary period and our current US flag.\r\nPlease
  feel free to comment on the logo in general as well.\r\nThanks alot for your help!\r\nGreg"

    are looking for something that says \u201Cpatriotic\u201D and \u201Cold New England\u201D
    ...seems like you have got that with the colours and all,and i initially thought
    the logo would be a bit more like a coat of arms?what you have got works but it
    feels too wide,because you have to balance out the flag pole 'L',i would get the
    flag separte from the L make it bigger and then place it behind\r\n\"New England\r\nMachinary\"\r\ntry
    it out ,also what about cogs that change into stars in a circle around that text?(like
    the really old american flag u guys use to have.)\r\nanyway thats my thoughts,better
    i left something than nothing i guess.(looking at the 60 people who read and didnt
    say anything)\r\nand as for the font,sorry i have no clue there...old english?!..see
    no clue."

  body: I am sold on the flag idea. what about just having a type that suggest New
    England (maybe look at the Boston press for ideas) and make something with it
    that suggest the robustness of the machines.

    you might try some more ideas out. How about taking a circle of stars ( very betsy
    ross you know ) & making it look embossed like it was in iron? Actually, what
    kind of machine work do they do? Maybe that should be hinted at in the logo too."

    a napkin. To much excution and not enough thought. Eben's thought on the Betsy
    Ross flag could be right on. The thirteen colonies and all. Try something simple
    like the name on three lines within the thirteen stars. The type doesn't say New
    England to me and I've lived most of my life in Connecticut. Try this do some
    research, do a google search. Find old New England symbols like Eagles with the
    flag. \r\n\r\nOn a side note you should listen to Stan Freberg Presents The United

      and dirty job, and I'm not going to be spending a lot more time developing new
      concepts, although the ideas, suggestions and feedback I've received thus far
      are appreciated... particularly Dan's theory about hitting the computer without
      enough up-front work... you're right! But, as I mentioned, down and dirty.\r\nI'm
      still hoping for a few more font suggestions, but the Grotesque seems interesting,

    myfonts.com search</a> yields some interesting results. It has a slab serify,
    old world commerce, condensed look with lots of character but not too much. There
    will be a lot of Wild West-ish fonts, but you'll probably find something with
    enough strength and character to stand up and stand out.\r\n\r\nAlso, another
    tack is going for the more American revolution, late 18th century historical look,
    but that might not give you the muscle and condensed look you need."
