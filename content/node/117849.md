    and from what I can gather via a bad Google translation, apparently hand-drawn.\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "Thank you, kthomps.   I agree it's probably hand drawn.  Thank you for listing
    all those possibilities anyway. After posting this I found another font it's somewhat
    close to, Susa, by Hubert Jocham:\r\nhttps://www.hubertjocham.de/shop/type/script/Susa/\r\n\r\n "
