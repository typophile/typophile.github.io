  body: My guess would be that this is a (rather awkwardly) reconstruction of a serif
    font from scratch. The tiny serifs and awkward curves say "amateur" to me. And
    maybe a hand-done rip of P22 Cezanne for the tagline. But I could be wrong.

  body: It is Arrow as Fivos said. It is lousy and amateurish as Craig said. Yet inexplicably
    popular.

  body: Thanks! My client is looking for something with small serifs, but right now
    she is wanting me to use Dream Orphans. As I refuse to use a typeface that only
    has serifs on one of the glyphs, I wanted to find a good alternative. Although,
    now that I am looking at Arrow, I completely agree. Any other good alternatives?

  body: Arrow is an old Headliners International face. Treacyfaces acquired the rights
    to that library years ago and markets some of them including Arrow (as <a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/050806_TFArrow_2c5a.html">TF
    Arrow</a>). (Don't bother with the italic. It's pretty bad. It wasn't part of
    the original design, but was added more recently.)

  body: "Actually, Arrow Italic makes for an instructive story - there's actually
    two of them, and they took turns: the first one was a mechanical oblique, then
    Joe figured to make a \"proper\" one. Except his customers were outraged and wanted
    the original back!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Well, it's the "proper" one that I don't think is very good (sorry, Joe, if
    you're reading this). There's certainly a subjective element to inventing an italic
    for a face that never had one, and I'm not sure how I would do it. But he did
    some things in it that look like they were borrowed from his other faces like
    Forever that I don't think fit Arrow's look look and feel. (Oblique doesn't do
    it, either.)
