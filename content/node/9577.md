  body: Oooops! Sorry. Let me retract that. I&#39;ll keep looking. It&#39;s not Ballantines
    Script.

  body: Ok how about this -- it&#39;s called Andrea in the sample I have, but I suspect
    another identity. &#40;I had it labeled as Dianna, but I can see it&#39;s not
    the same.&#41;<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66623.gif"

  body: Yes, I have just been hunting since you posted that. It turns out that &#39;Alison&#39;,
    which appears as freeware all over the web, is a modification of Dianna/Ballantines/Balladeer
    etc. The font files still have the orginal A and G included. Robert &amp; Nancy
    Wall of Chameleon Graphics apparently re-drew those two letters and effectively
    created a new font. Those two letters are often the most distinctive, so that
    was a clever method to apparently create something new. <BR> <BR>So I feel better
    that I was not far off with my first ID<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Here is a quick rendering of the sample word using Alison. It needed serious
    tracking adjustments &#40;and I need practice with outlining techniques&#41;.  Below
    it is the same word with the original A &#40;Shift-Option-A on Mac&#41;. <BR><img
