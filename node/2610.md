  lets you use your own handwriting for the text you write on your computer.  <BR>It
  turns a scanned sample of your handwriting into a computer font that you can use  <BR>in
  your word processor or graphics program, just like regular fonts such as Helvetica.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t tried it out yet. It&#39;s a free service, so this might
  be fun to try. I think it would be interesting to see a collection of Typophile
  hand-written typefaces. <BR> <BR>What do you think?

  body: Yes, some people successfully created fonts and posted  <BR>samples at <a
    href="http://typographi.ca/000763.php">Typographica</a>. The system seems very
    rudimentary,  <BR>but it is an interesting breakthrough in automation.
