  handwriting. My handwriting was terrible (still is in my book) but has improved
  since I started. I love to read and see the beautiful works that are on display
  in older text. To me, nowadays, writing is a lost art. Now, I want to bring that
  back; for me at least. I am twenty two years of age and have one fountain pen for
  calligraphy along with several nibs (Speedball and Hunt) and was wondering if anyone
  had any tips along these lines:\r\n\r\n1. What is a good book that could get me
  into the basics of calligraphy? \r\n2. What is a normal (ordinary) way for a person
  to become immersed into this art?\r\n3. Are there any techniques that would help
  my handwriting to become better without slowing down speed? (In other words incorporating
  calligraphy with day-to-day writing; like taking notes in class)\r\n4. While being
  an unemployed student I have a low budget but have some of the materials needed.
  What type of materials are best suited for practice? Also important documents (letters
  and the like). For example, I have tried two types of inks and don't believe there
  is any that is truly water proof, if there is that would be helpful. \r\n\r\nSince
  I am an unpublished writer & poet I prefer to write by hand, so any advice for a
  neophyte like myself would be immensely helpful!"
