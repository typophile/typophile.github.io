body: Hi, I&#39;m trying really hard to match this typeface, and it looks like FB
  Magneto &#40;with an outline&#41; at first glance, but the &#39;a&#39; is rounded
  and the &#39;e&#39; is closed. It looks much more readable than Magneto.  <BR> <BR><img

  possible that it was altered by the person who originally set the text, but I&#39;m
  really doubting that, and think instead it&#39;s an alternative cut of Magneto that
  I&#39;m not familiar with. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know? <BR> <BR>thanks, Aaron.

  body: I think you are right to pick Magneto as the base font. The differences you
    noted could have been simple modifications done at the same time the outlining
    was added. The basic shapes of the R and O are also like Magneto, and only the
    I looks like a completely new &#40;and simple&#41; letter.

  body: I thought that too, but when I put it next to the actual Magneto set font,
    the &#39;e&#39; and the &#39;a&#39; and the rounded corners at the top right of
    the &#39;i&#39; and the &#39;l&#39; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/36779.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s so close, yet so different. I also think the weight
    may be lighter.  <BR> <BR>

  body: I think those differences are relatively minor tweaks using a graphics program
    like Illustrator. You convert the lettering to outlines and then move some of
    the corner points around. I think these would be fairly simple modifications for
    anyone skilled in using Illustrator. Outlining can be done in such a way that
    it appears to reduce the letter weight, so I think this is still consistent with
    a modification of Magneto. The letterforms, slant, strokes and x-height all seem
    to me to be identical. Only relatively minor details have been altered.  If I
    had this font I could try to demonstrate with a quick &amp; dirty simulation,
    but my skill at this is mediocre, and an experienced artist would &#40;I think&#41;
    make these changes easily.
