body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI donated an experimental display typeface to my favorite
  web-radio-station <a href='http://www.dublab.com/protondrive/'>dublab</a>.\r\n\r\nBut
  I'm not really helping them with their fund-racer without putting some music loving
  type-designers on this subject. So I should do some rude self-promotion: By donating
  an amount over 50$ you will get a price-package in retune which as well contains
  an exclusive mix-cd by dublab-dj <a href='http://www.jimmytamborello.com/'>Jimmy
  Tamborello</a> (a.k.a. Dntel, The Postal Service, James Figurine).\r\n\r\nI originally
  designed this font for the audio-visual exhibition <a href='http://www.intoinfinity.org/'>Into
  Infinity</a>. My contribution is also posted on my <a href='http://www.ewalthert.com/'>frontpage</a>.\r\n\r\nMy
  sounding Typeface:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SonicWaves_abc400_5967.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  the funny thing, it will come with a folder of sound-files:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SoundEditor_3894.png]"
