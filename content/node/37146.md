  has a web host they'd recommend, and if there are any where you don't have to upload
  files individually. Are there any web hosting platforms where you can just select
  a folder and upload everything at once?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nK"

    program for doing your file transfer work. If you don't mind me asking, who's
    your current host?\r\n\r\nI use 1and1.com and they've worked well for me. Also
    have a site set up on a buddy's computer in Australia, and other than his occasional
    system troubles, never had problems there."

  body: "I guess Media Temple is pretty good. I have a Dutch hoster myself, but a
    friend of mine uses Media Temple (and I believe Typophile was or is hosted there
    as well).\r\n\r\nBut I think you should be able to upload a whole dir on your
    current host too. However, with FTP, files are always uploaded one by one, until
    the whole dir is uploaded. But I'm probably stating the obvious. ;)"

    than Media Temple, and their support is amazing! U get individual control panels
    that are very helpful and can upload your files in more than one way.

  body: "What server environment do you need? What apps installed? What application
    support? Shared or dedicated box? Bandwidth needs? Budget? Support?\r\n\r\nAs
    for 'upload multiple files at one'...as stated, FTP or SFTP access will provide
    that, and is a rather basic feature at any Web Host. I'm rather shocked that yours
    doesn't offer that. "

    most, but it\u2019s a rock-solid BSD environment with excellent support\u2014or
    at least they were the last time I had a problem. It\u2019s been five years."

  body: It's been a while since I've shopped around and compared what's out there,
    but I've been using [[http://www.webintellects.com/|WebIntellects]] for many years
    now and they've been reliable and reasonably priced. If you're looking for good
    helper apps and other enhancements, you might want to take a close look at what
    they have -- I don't use that stuff much. They have good Unix-based servers, and
    I use my own FTP client to move files back and forth. Their tech support has always
    been very responsive.
