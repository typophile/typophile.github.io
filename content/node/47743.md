  designed based upon the work of the \"brigade Chac\xF3n\", the graphic team of the
  Chilean Communist Party.\r\nI make it in a grungie style, because it's used in painted
  paper over walls.\r\nI had to do the \"no grunge\" style for the work in Chacon,
  but i prefer the texture and the style of Chacon.\r\nPlease critique."

    the typeface first and add scratches later.\r\n\r\n\"K\" and \"R\" are not legible
    to me. \"I\" looks shorter in white text. \"G\" looks like borrowed from another
    typeface.\r\n\r\nHow about a \"Y\" like below? IMHO it suits your typeface better...
    To E, F, A etc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/poster-13_5978.jpg]"

    \"\u0427\""

  body: "\"K\" seems like a stylized \"V\" to me and \"R\" is a \"D\". More with the
    \"R\"; looking at the \"P\", it's so different.\r\n\r\nSuppose you're looking
    at a poster from a far distance:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-11_5001.png]\r\n\r\nI
    know \"\u0427\" is cyrillic, but it should fit better. Current \"Y\" associates
    to Bauhaus as in ITC-Bauhaus bold's \"Y\". \"\u0427\" looks like a \"4\" though."
