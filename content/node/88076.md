  body: "The top type looks similar to French Round Face, also shown in McGrew's book.
    \ 19th Century types are not as well documented, at least in my collection of
    books, as 20th century ones, so I may only be able to get something similar.\r\n\r\n-

    Capitals]]</strong> by Amy Conger\r\nwhich seems close enough to \"HJALMAR...\"\r\n\r\nThere
    is a possibility the designer have used a source design\r\nclose to your font,
    I suppose you can send a message and ask:\r\nhttp://www.abecedarienne.com/about/\r\n"
