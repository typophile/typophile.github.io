    said it was from a documentary. I would not expect them to be newly created in
    that case.\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, the answer would have to be something from
    that time period (and possibly not existing as a digital font).\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Looking through the Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" I don't see many
    lineales with the oblong counters and a G with no 'beard'. One candidate could
    be Reform Grotesque from Stempel (called Information in the Klingspor version),
    which has several condensed weights. The design goes back before the 40's, so
    it is credible to be used (in Italy?) by these dates.\r\n\r\nStarting to look
    for the strange serif used for MONTAGNANA.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
