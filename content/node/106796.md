body: This is the first round of a logo for a music project called Glass slipper.
  Deep, techy house with a soulful female vocals. Colors are placeholder only. Would
  love feedback. Still trying to figure out how to dot that "i"

  body: 'Nice idea! I think you need to work on the execution a bit, the colours clearly,
    but also lots of elements not really lining up, and little inconsistencies in
    the construction: the two different s constructions, the detached r, the fact
    that on most letters the instroke is behind the outstroke, but not on the first
    p, which frankly gives me an escherian headache trying to figure out its twisted
    3d construction. (Actually, that''s not the only letter than feels internally
    twisted. Have alook on the other p too. and, as you mention, the i.)'

  body: Thanks for your detailed feedback, Birdseeding. Funny because all the things
    you mentioned, with the exception of instroke/outstroke inconsistencies, were
    intentional on my part. Mostly in the name of variation, i.e. I didnt want the
    two p's to look exactly the same, detached r to make it look more handwritten,
    etc. But perhaps I should reconsider some of these elements if they take away
    from the design. I definitely don't want to be responsible for any Escherian headaches!

  body: Here's my latest revision, with new colors, resolved the instroke/outstroke
    issues and fixed general inconsistancies. Thoughts?
