  body: "That's the strangest G I've seen on a sans typeface. The closest family I
    can think of is Red Rooster's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/gothic-rr/|Gothic]],
    which has alternate variant letters that are more like some from your sample,
    such as the C and G. You would have to edit the G and the R to make them more
    like yours.\r\n\r\nJust out of curiosity, how old is this sample?\r\n\r\n- Mike
