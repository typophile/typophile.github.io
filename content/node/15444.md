body: "The form of the letters you use to compose words and texts often expresses
  more than you suspect. With the series of exhibitions entitled Type An Sich, the
  Catapult design office awards the letter the attention it deserves. In the spring
  of 2005 our gallery presented the letters of the Dutch typographer Gerard Unger.
  This autumn it is his French colleague Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez who is taking up
  the torch. The exhibition from 13 October until 31 December 2005. Opening hours:
  weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. A lecture will be held on 24 November 2005 (more
  details later).\r\nCatapult, Rubenslei 10, 2018 Antwerp, Belgium.\r\n(close to the
  city park, within walking distance of Antwerp central station). T 03 239 10 10,

    US). I like what I see on your links.  Perhaps a book or magazine article could
    be developed from your material and give it a broader distribution?\r\n\r\nChrisL"
