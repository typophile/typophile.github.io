  body: This image is too small to be sure, but if it were Futura, you'd recognize
    it and you wouldn't be posting here. So based on the album's release date (1977)
    I'm going to guess it's Kabel, which was very popular in the 70s.

    the image iteself.\r\n\r\nClearly not Kabel. My best guess is <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/century-gothic/'

    then it is Avenir .
