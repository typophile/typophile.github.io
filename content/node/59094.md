  and am trying to find an ideal type. i've more or less settled on the one  in the
  book at the following link and attached (which i believe is jenson pro regular).
  however, i'll also be adding extensive annotations at the foot of the page, as well
  as margin definitions of obscure words, which perhaps should be in a less artsy
  font. can anyone recommend a font that would be compatible with the jenson (if jenson
  it is?).\r\n\r\n[[http://www.amazon.com/Short-Epics-Tatti-Renaissance-Library/dp/0674014839/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1245172084&sr=8-3]]\r\n\r\nalso,
  is there a way to buy a font for a trial anywhere? or to buy onet inexpensively
  but legitimately? i see jenson for $35 from adobe, but would rather not buy it unless
  i know for sure it's what i want. i'll search a little on this site as well...\r\n\r\nthanks!!"
