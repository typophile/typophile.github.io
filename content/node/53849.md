    why is the v in \"reserved\" different?)"

  body: "Joostmarcellis: maybe I can use the other simple version of \"g\" instead
    of that \"g\" but When you see that square gliphs on first time, you can't sure
    which is wiuch... and I want to make several differences between number \"9\"
    and letter \"g\" when Alphanumeric series appear on same line.\r\n\r\nSpeter:
    About counters I believe that can be greater.. I remember try this and honestly
    now I see this need a better counter space. And .. oh god.. about that messy \"v\"
    when I write that I haven't ready my last version \"v\" and I temporary used another
    typo there and forgot change to last version, sorry. xD\r\n\r\nThanks guys for
    that useful observations, I'll try to improve taking your words.. =D\r\nPeGGO"

    i can show you later on what i mean with the g, dont go for the normal g that
    makes it boring. The small counters shouldn't be a problem if you don't use to
    small"

  body: I like it, but there are two small things that stand out for me. I think perhaps
    D and O are a bit too similar. Is there anything you could do to differentiate
    them more - perhaps a bottom serif for the D? Also I'm not sure how well the long
    f fits in with the lower case. But of course these are both entirely subjective
    - perhaps they won't be problems for other people. I'll look forward to seeing
    any future versions.
