  It doesn''t show up as something I can choose when I select the letter I wish to
  change. Is it not possible with this font? '

    course, alternative glyphs can only be employed in OpenType fonts. In InDesign
    there is a glyph \"flyout\" menu where you click on an arrow and it displays the
    alternates.\r\n\r\nCorrect me, anyone, if I'm wrong. Because the other day, I
    wuz working with a PS font and I typed \"f\" and then \"i\", and it became the
    \"fi\" glyph. Evidently, if a font has those glyphs, InDesign will use them, regardless
    of whether the font is OpenType or not."

  body: I don't think there is a glyph menu in version 10. Can you input via Unicode?

  body: InDesign will use the "standard" ligatures if the "ligatures" box is checked,
    which it is by default. This means that the Mac PST1-standard fi and fl glyphs
    will be accessed. But if the designer happened to stick ff, ffi, ffl, or any other
    ligatures to replace programming or mathematic glyphs, InDesign won't recognise
    them. That's because a ffi ligature inserted in the spot normally taken up by
    pi - for example - will still be pi as far as InDesign is concerned.

  body: "AFAIK, Illustrator 10 doesn't support OpenType features or Unicode. Illustrator
    CS and CS2 do.\r\n\r\nInDesign will recognize ligatures if they have names like
    \"ffi\" or \"f_f_i\" and automatically use them, if they exist in Type 1 fonts
    and even OpenType fonts that don't have a \"liga\" feature. Not sure if it works
    with TrueType fonts, but I would think so. \r\n\r\nNB: If you are making a font,
    you have to be careful about this. It will work with any ligature, even discretionary
    ones, if you don't explicitly add the \"liga\" and \"dlig\" features. You may
    end up with st and ct ligatures showing up whether you want them to or not."
