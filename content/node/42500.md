  on a new logo for a Class 1 training school. Smaller business needing a bit of a
  logo update. So here's what I have so far and the original. More looking for ideas
  for the typeface; placement sizing and all but suggestions and comments on the mark
  are fine too. Thanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freeeagle-logo_5208.jpg]\r\n\r\nPS.
  I realized it resembles Ferrari's logo a bit (slab serif under image of animal)
  which was totally unintentional."

  body: When I first saw this, I was reminded of a teenagers' clothing shop.  Considering
    it's about training truckers to drive, try to pursue a more "proud to be an American"
    tack.  The type should have more of a country western feel to it, I think (think
    "Cracker Barrel").

  body: Ironically it's not an American company, it's Canadian, heh but maybe that
    point is still applicable. I'm not sure how they'd feel about too much of a western
    feel but I could play around with it. I was thinking a little more classy and
    corporate looking than that.

    some slightly more modern sans to go with it if you're aiming for the 'corporate'
    look. It'll also help move it away from the American vibe."

  body: Yes the URL is difficult to type as you have to keep hitting the 'e' so many
    times. The thought of using a sans crossed my mind but I feel it might not look
    as strong. Any suggestions on some faces to try out? I will have to play around
    with combinations of loose light text vs tighter heavy text.

    what your effort is trying to express for <em>their</em> company.\r\n\r\nTo me,
    your effort is either an intentional blurring of the Ultramar automobile service
    station mark and your driving school mark, or perhaps just by chance the two expressions
    are very much alike.\r\n\r\nEither way, I hope the driving school as a seperate
    and privately owned company will push for their own identity. Which in turn will
    push your <em>own</em> creativity.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm not to crazy about the font choice on "Driver Education LTD". Mixing serif
    fonts isn't usually a wise design choice. Perhaps a sans serif for contrast would
    be more suitable. I'd also make it slightly shorter in line length than "FREE
    EAGLE" to balance your image on top better and to help direct the eye towards
    "FREE EAGLE" more so.

    definitely not intentional. I did extensive studies on eagles and this pose is
    far from unseen. I felt it was a strong enough posture without being completely
    aggressive as seen in a hunting/fishing posture. I did a lot of sketching before
    coming up with this one. I had some ideas for doing just a head but that's been
    done (USPS) and didn't want it to be too abstract either.\r\n\r\nAsvetic: Well
    it's not really \"mixing\" as they are the same typeface\" but I will try using
    a sans. I'll see if I can find a nice complementary face. As stated before I don't
    think a name change is possible. Name's been around for around 10 years and I'm
    not sure the client is too huge on a completely new logo direction either but
    I think what I have so far isn't too extreme.\r\n\r\nI'm still open to ideas and
    will try to incorporate some. I just know some of the ideas may not fly so sorry

    a different expression would greatly improve the mark. Also, consider using the
    bird's wing span to help emphasis the expression of 'Free'. By appling your idea
    of white head and neck plummage on the tail feathers as well will help enhance
    the wing span.\r\n\r\nGood luck."

    DRIVER EDUCATION LTD is just a description of what service FREE EAGLE performs.\r\n\r\nThis
    is Freight Sans, but you could use any gothic sans like Trade Gothic, Franklin
    Gothic, Avenir, Gotham...\r\n\r\nI also reduced the size of DRIVER EDUCATION LTD,

    were almost identical just one being sans and the other serif. I'm still unsure
    of how the relationship between two fonts that go well together is but certainly
    like this idea. Secondly I didn't think of making it smaller like that and having
    it NOT line up with the edges of the \"FREE EAGLE\" but I think that seeing as
    Free Eagle is the name of the company and Driver Education LTD just describes
    what they do it's a very nice adjustment.\r\n\r\nI will continue to update and
