  admired professor Dr. Klimis Mastoridis and would like to share it with you as well.\r\n\r\n\"MoMA
  has just acquired 23 digital typefaces for its Architecture and Design Collection.
  Some are of everyday use, like Verdana; others are familiar characters in our world,
  like Gotham, which was used in President Obama\u2019s election campaign, or OCR-A,
  which we can find at the bottom of any product\u2019s bar code; and others are still
  less common, but exquisitely resonant, like Walker or Template Gothic.\"\r\n\r\nYou
  may read the full article <a href=\"http://moma.org/explore/inside_out/2011/01/24/digital-fonts-23-new-faces-in-moma-s-collection\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6263.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSB"

    listism, and not much different from the commentary of anyone who has written
    an opinionated type history, from Updike to Blackwell.\r\n\r\nThe return on investment\u2014the
    value added\u2014from which the museum profits in admission fees and collateral
    revenue (catalog sales &c.), is produced by the curators.\r\n\r\nI am in two minds
    of how good this is for type designers. On the one hand, being propped by MoMA
    enhances our status, but on the other it devalues our work. Let's face it, \"acquiring\"
    typefaces is a cheap way to put on a show. I don't see any House Industries fonts
    on the list \u2014 their licence (for, say, the brilliantly Postmodern Chalet,
    a suitably modern arty type) may have been a bit prohibitive, perhaps gearing
    fees to gallery admissions!\r\n\r\nIt also undermines the position of the museum,
    because it opens the door for virtual curation. Now anyone can be a curator.\r\n\r\nFontshop's
    Best of 2009 was \"hand picked\" -- will its Best of 2010 be \"curated\"? I hope
    so!"

    for the larger questions about what \"acquisition\" means, I note that kottke.org

    article</a> linked above, quoting curator Paola Antonelli: <cite>\u201C.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
    it sets curators free to tag the world and acknowledge things that 'cannot be

    because they are in the air and belong to everybody and to no one, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

    I\u2019m probably expecting too much of a type-historical component in such a
    listing.\r\n\r\nBut this is darn 1990s-heavy. To me, typefaces like Blur or Template
    Gothic represent rather the exploration of new technical possibilities and very
    temporary shapes without adding to, let alone creating something of \u2018revisionary\u2019
    value (is that even a word?).\r\nI haven\u2019t seen these two particular designs
    for a while and every time I see them, it\u2019s either a design from the 90s
    or something that unfortunately looks like from the 90s.\r\n\r\nSo many type-historically
    important typefaces are missing, wouldn\u2019t even know where to start.\r\nAnd
