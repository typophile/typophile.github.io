  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been having a running conversation on the Design forum about my burgeoning interest in typeface design&ndash;I am a book designer and page layout artist. Initially, of course, FontLab Studio comes up as <i>the</i> software package of choice for professional typeface design. Some have said, Type Tool is also something to start with and then, as necessary, make the switch later to FontLab.</p>
<p>Some mention was made of the open source package FontForge. I&rsquo;m on a dual processor G5 PowerMac running OS 10.4.10. After understanding what was necessary to get the X11 server package installed, it was an eay matter of installing and running FontForge, even though it is UNIX-based and I am not a techie.</p>
<p>But I was also told &ldquo;given that there is a learning curve for any of the programs,&rdquo; I &ldquo;risk wasting time by going with [FontForge]. &hellip; some software people use it, but not the design community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How do folks here feel about that? Is it accurate? Should I just stay away from FontForge, start with TypeTool if the investment is presently too much to get FontLab (but assume that professional typeface design will eventually mean moving to FontLab Studio)? Does anyone do viable, professional creative work in FontForge?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>also, if you use Windows, you may install the free Microsoft VOLT or the free Adobe FDK for OpenType (AFDKO) to add your OpenType features. A combination of TypeTool 3 + VOLT or TypeTool 3 + AFDKO will actually let you build professional-quality OpenType fonts. Since TypeTool 3 is based on the FontLab Studio 5 core, the technical quality of the fonts made in TypeTool 3 will not be any less from those made in FontLab Studio 5 (esp. if one only uses autohinting in FLS5 rather than manual hinting, which most people do these days &ndash; FLS5 lets you do both auto and manual, and TT3 only does auto, but uses the same algorithms as FLS5).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I tried using Typetool, and while it is a great program, I was really just using it to compile fonts that I was building in Illustrator due to some of the Typetool drawing limitations. But I find that drawing letters in Fontlab is often easier, and keeps me from running into the performance and file management issues that come along with keeping the letters in Illustrator. This week I decided to just move on and upgraded to Fontlab, which wasn’t to hard on my wallet now that Fontlab offers academic discounts.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind about Fontforge is that, being an esoteric open source program, the amount of quality help and support that you’re likely to get for it is something like nil. If you have trouble with Fontlab, you can just post here and eventually one of the Fontlab programmers will probably answer your question.</p>

I&rsquo;m transitioning from my decade old copy of Fontographer to FontForge, and while it hasn&rsquo;t exactly been smooth, the tools in FontForge offer a lot of significant improvements. As far as technical support, if you sign up for both the users and developers (for bug reporting) mailing lists, you have direct access to the program&rsquo;s author who takes very quick action to address any problems, and if it takes altering the program to effect the fix, he&rsquo;ll do so without hesitation (first with a patch, and at least once a month with a full build).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Steve,</p>
<p>First of all, I don&rsquo;t think learning FontForge can be considered a waste of time even if you decide not to use it for your actual work. In general, I am sure that having some experience with &ldquo;alternate&rdquo; applications is always extremely useful, because it allows you to understand the difference between the peculiarities of your application of choice (e. g. Word or FontLab) and your general task (e. g. word processing or font design) and thus to use your favorite application more effectively.</p>
<p>Regarding FontForge itself: I used it for several years, and now I am also participating in its development by submitting patches. I have also some experience with FontLab, and I am sure that FontForge is better at many aspects. In particular, I heard many font designers (especially those who had previously got familiar with Fontographer) to complain that FontLab is very inconvenient as a spline editor. But drawing glyphs with FontForge is a real joy, so that no external tools are required. Just one example: FontForge has an option to mark extrema points and points of inflection on the spline. Thus if I see that handles of some of my points expected to be positioned at extrema are not exactly horizontal/vertical I can easily correct this, while in FontLab I would have to run FontAudit to notice this  problem. BTW, I often see slightly distorted extrema even in costy commercial fonts, and I am sure this would be not possible if their designers had used FontForge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FontForge is much more powerful than FL in designing OpenType layouts. In particular it allows to define anchor points for combining marks (&lsquo;mark&rsquo; and &lsquo;mkmk&rsquo; features) which neither FontLab nor AFDKO support. Well, most designers currently do that with VOLT, but VOLT is only for TrueType fonts, while FontForge supports the OpenType-CFF format as well. FontForge also has a nice intuitive GUI for adding OT features, which is much clearer for me than feature files with their obscure syntax.</p>
<p>I should mention also the main (to my mind) FontForge&rsquo;s disadvantage, which still makes using it for production quality TrueType fonts a bit difficult. FontForge&rsquo;s TTF autoinstructing code is really bad, and the developer was not interested in fixing this problem for years. However, things are changing now, as there are volunteers working to improve this functionality. On the other hand, FontForge already may be very useful even for creating/modifying TTF instructions: first, it allows to modify them directly (unlike FontLab), and second, it has an excellent TTF debugger which is extremely useful for anyone who would like to understand how exactly his/her instructions work.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m really the most elementary kind of a novice at this, I can&rsquo;t really draw a lick, and I&rsquo;m seeing this as a long-term project, I&rsquo;m actually starting by reading some history of type stuff. I know the typefaces I like the looks of; now I want to see how they fit in to various ways of categorizing them. And then maybe the next step will be to start sketching by hand some characters. After that, I imagine, it will be time to bring FontForge into the mix.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be keeping this forum informed.</p>

Being on a new laptop, I had to install the program fresh. It does not, however, start, as one of the libraries is missing. So now I am faced with two options: just stick with Fontlab, or uninstall Fontforge and start installing older Fontforge packages until I get one that works.</p>

<p>You should understand your problem has nothing to do with free software. Many open source applications have been successfully ported to Windows (or MacOS) and can be installed and used just like any other native programs. But FontForge is a Unix application, which means you need some Unix knowledge even if you are running it in your Windows environment under Cygwin (I suppose the same would be true for most X11 applications under MacOS). Nobody never promised that installing a Cygwin application would be as easy as a native Windows application, but having a Cygwin port is just better than nothing.</p>
<p>So if you are not prepared to some small difficulties, which, unfortunately, are unavoidable when you are running an application written for another platform, then, indeed, it is better for you to stick with your favorite software. Otherwise I am sure your problem can easily be resolved. But please don&rsquo;t blame something you haven&rsquo;t even tried.</p>

<p>I’ve been running on some variant of UNIX or Linux, from Solaris to OS X, and putting up with free software, for most of the last decade. And I don’t deign to work on Windows, much less Cygwin. And yeah, I could just try to track down the missing library and try to get stuff working, but this sort of stuff is why I just stick with commercial software most of the time. I’m sure that Fontforge can be a great tool, but I can’t begin to describe how many hundreds of hours I have wasted dealing with some little thing here or there when it comes to free software, which is why I jumped ship from Linux to OS X and eventually stopped using most free software entirely.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As I made the argument that learning Font Forge is a <em>risk</em> of wasting time, of course I don&rsquo;t think it is a silly argument. If your main interest is in making fonts, not learning software, then you are going to want to minimize your time away from design time. Designing fonts is extremely time consuming, and for me at least learning FontLab and getting to use it with some fluency has also taken time, and I&rsquo;m still learning.</p>
<p>FontLab is not the most complex application&ndash;from what I hear Pro Tools for sound engineering is way more complex&ndash;but it does take some serious time to get on top of. Given the complexity of font technology now, I can&rsquo;t imagine that other options are a lot simpler, when you include interpolation tools, including multiple masters, as well as spacing, kerning, hinting, and open type programming.</p>
<p>Also, the idea that what software application you use is just a &lsquo;flavor&rsquo; and &lsquo;moot&rsquo; as a general proposition does not seem to me defensible. Publisher and InDesign are both page layout programs, but I don&rsquo;t think even MicroSoft would say that Publisher is just as good for full-on professional work.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t learned other font design applications, so I can&rsquo;t compare their merits. But I can report that at TypeCon earlier this month there were lots of workshops on FontLab, some using the revived Fontographer, and none on Font Forge. I never even heard Font Forge mentioned. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there are zero professional type designers who use it, judging by conferences and Typophile discussions. In any case there are certainly very few among those doing latin scripts.</p>
<p>If Font Forge is actually distinctly better, and you can do the same stuff with it, or with it plus other usable programs, then it would absolutely be worth learning and using. Otherwise, I don&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s a good investment of time.</p>
<p>As font design is very time consuming, if Type Tool and the full Font Lab are actually better than Font Forge, then worrying about the $99 seems to me like really false economy. I realize that in poor countries this might be a lot of money, and the money might be a significant factor. But in rich countries it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>To me the main question is really how good Font Forge is, not the cost of Type Tool.</p>

<p>William,</p>
<p>I appreciate this approach very much. What I really don&rsquo;t like is arguments like &ldquo;nobody uses it&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an esoteric open source software&rdquo;. You should try it before criticizing it. Or just browse the online documentation at [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/overview.html]] and see how powerful FontForge is.</p>
<p>And yes, I can easily believe no professional designers are using FontForge, but this proves nothing for me. There are several known reasons (I would not like to discuss them here) for which most folks concerned with graphics and design are not familiar with Unix and Unix software. I also think the problem with TTF instructions I have mentioned previously could affect FontForge&rsquo;s popularity too: of course it would be not a real problem for those who have access to VTT, but&hellip; there are so many &ldquo;professional&rdquo; designers who prefer just to export an autohinted font and then claim their production is perfectly hinted. Unfortunately, this is impossible with FontForge (but probably will be possible soon).</p>
<p>And, finally, there are very few real professionals in font design anyway (I believe most of them can be found at this forum). I know enough  font foundries which promote themselves as &ldquo;professional&rdquo; but actually sell so poorly designed amateurish fonts, that the fact they use FontLab really doesn&rsquo;t matter. On the other hand, I can list several open source font projects implemented at a high professional level (my favorite is the [[http://junicode.sourceforge.net|Junicode]] font) which use FontForge. I think their designers can be considered real professionals, even if font design is not their main business.</p>
<p>You can have a look also at my own [[http://www.thessalonica.org.ru/en/fonts.html|Old Standard]] font. If it has any flaws (and of course it does), FontForge is surely not responsible for them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I am by no means a techie. And I found that once someone told me in two or three straight declarative sentences how to get X11 off the systems disk, I had no problem installing it on my G5 PowerMac. And FontForge downloaded and installed easily.</p>
<p>I can see where this discussion&rsquo;s gone already, so I hesitate because I don&rsquo;t want to start a whole platforms war. I just want to say that, in my experience&ndash;as a non-techie&ndash;that&rsquo;s why Macintosh rocks and has been my choice 17 years: it&rsquo;s easy to get going and just start learning how to do the work you want to do. Rather than learning how to use the computer, and install and configure jazz. I know the Windows machines at my day job are constantly down or slowing down&ndash;even just for minutes can be a drastic inconvenience.</p>
<p>That said, since this is simply a long-term project and book design/layout is really my work, I gues FontForge is definitely a reasonable choice for me at this stage.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>William points out above that FontLab is NOT owned or distributed by Adobe. I use Adobe products every day, but part of me can understand why some designers might want to &ldquo;diversify&rdquo; their software portfolio, so to speak, and use products from other companies. No problems there.</p>
<p>What makes me wary about a lot of OpenSource-talk is the &ldquo;values&rdquo; that are often implicit, and which are so often brought up. Values? I guess that I just have different values.</p>
<p>FontLab is a small company. I don&rsquo;t know how many employees it currently has, but I&rsquo;m thinking 10–15, tops. And that is spread across multiple countries and continents. I don&rsquo;t think more than a few ever work in the same room.</p>
<p>FontLab, and other companies like it (inclucing many in the type design industry), IS the little guy. They are the people on the forefront bringing technology forward, and trying to make a living from it, too. I think that that is worth supporting. Here is why my values come into play ;-)</p>
<p>Personally, I think that it is more worthwhile to support these 10–15 guys spending their working careers trying to make a great product than to support some vague, hobby-level &ldquo;opens ource&rdquo; movement. Especially if I&rsquo;m making a living using these products.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&lsquo;[…]But I can report that at TypeCon earlier this month there were lots of workshops on FontLab, some using the revived Fontographer, and none on Font Forge […]&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fact that an application is the choice of the majority does not per definition proof that it is the best tool for every purpose. For instance Windows is also the choice of the majority, but the operating system does not seem to be very popular in general on this forum (which as such is interesting, if only because of the fact, that the Windows platform represents the largest market for font producers and besides that, Microsoft has done a lot for both font technology development and the font community in general [like sponsoring events]).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if DTL FontMaster was mentioned at TypeCon, but presumably not. That does not mean that it is not a good, or perhaps for certain tasks even better and more powerful font production tool than any other available on the market. FM was simply not developed for the &lsquo;mass market&rsquo; (nor is our organization very much suited for extensive [low level] customer support). 
I don&rsquo;t expect our customers to attend workshops either; the most work on a large scale and are very capable of solving or circumventing inevitable font production related problems themselves. But sometimes even FM users come to us with unexpected problems, like for instance recently with a request for support for glyphs with higher Unicodes, i.e. not in the BMP, which was added subsequently to the program then.</p>
<p>If one wants to judge a font production tool, in my opinion at least two parts of the production have to be separated: first, the conversion from design into outlines and second, the conversion from the outlines into font formats (for a more detailed separation see: <a href="http://www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/FM_docs/Automating%20using%20FM.pdf">http://www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/FM_docs/Automating%20using%20FM.pdf</a>
Concerning the first part generally a couple of Bezier editors are comparable when it comes to functionality (although not in detail, of course), but when it comes for instance to manually digitizing this functionality is only supported by DTL IkarusMaster. 
The generated font formats must be reliable, according to the specs and the results reproducible. Concerning the latter, because OpenType layout features files can be used in batch in FM, all GSUB features supported by the AFDKO will be added automatically to every font that has applicable characters. This way it is not only unnecessary to do the same work for all the &lsquo;common&rsquo; GSUB stuff, but it also assures consistency throughout a library (which is important for the success of the OpenType format itself). It actually does not make much sense to me to do this per font.</p>
<p>By the way, I don&rsquo;t think that the platform on which an application is running, should be an issue; if only for the customer support for the generated fonts one must have knowledge of and control over at least the mainstream operating systems and applications anyway.</p>
<p>The Ikarus based file structure of FM was developed for batching (I will show this in detail at the ATypI TypeTech Forum at Brighton). For the most needed functionality, like merging glyph data, generating composites, checking glyph data, generating fonts, et cetera, extensive batch functionality is built-in and mostly controlled by simple command files. 
If one wants to make full use of this batch power, for instance for generating all current font formats for all typefaces in a library in all applicable code pages at once with the call of just a single command file, some reading and good organizing is necessary. But not everybody wants to draw letters on paper and subsequently manually digitize these, or needs the batch power, or want to spent more money on a font production tool, or likes a modular structure, or is willing to use a tool that is not the choice of many colleagues (which means less direct assistance from others in the field, or perhaps even no workshops at for instance TypeCon [although this can be organized on request, I reckon]).
Others only want to work with apps for Mac OS X, or want to add more or less comparable batch functionality themselves through Python scripting, because it fits their purposes better or perhaps because they just simply like to do it. Maybe some will wait for certain already available technology to appear in some way in their favourite application(s). And there will be probably plenty of other rational and irrational reasons and explanations for the use of certain tools.</p>
<p>In short, it is a relatively small but complex, diverse and interesting market for font production tools. Objective judgement of the offered technology looks even more complex.</p>

<p>In FontLab you can make the size of nodes big or small, colored or black &amp; white. Go to Tools/Options/Glyph Window/Appearance and check or uncheck the appropriate boxes.</p>
<p>With all due respect, when you tell me you prefer FontForge, but don&rsquo;t know the FontLab interface, I am not moved to try FontForge. When I hear of experienced type designers singing the praises of Font Forge, I will start to take notice. Personally I am skeptical that FontForge can be that good without a base of professional type designers interacting with it, and the programmers to respond. But I&rsquo;d be glad to hear more.</p>
<p>Mr. Blokland: 
I didn&rsquo;t mention FontMaster as this thread was started by a question whether to use to use a free program, rather than TypeTool, which only costs $99 US. FontMaster Utilities are considerably more expensive than the full FontLab. And from the description on your site&ndash;and here&ndash;they have seemed to be targeted more to foundries than individual type designers.</p>
<p>I have heard about the FontMaster utilities, but not a lot. It was mentioned here on Typophile that Miguel Sousa at Adobe was impressed by the Kern Master. And the very high quality of DTL fonts of course speaks well for the tools. I don&rsquo;t think many people have seen your tools demonstrated, so I would think for most they are a question mark.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Steve Tiano: in answer to your original question, yes, FontForge is a perfectly viable tool. I use it along with my own Spiro tools for the fonts I create. But I&rsquo;m very strange: to me, reading the code and understanding the way the geometry happens under the hood is very important. I&rsquo;m also quite capable of fixing things myself when they&rsquo;re broken, and indeed have sent patches back to George.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also more than a bit frustrating and maddening. The UI is by no means up to the standards of modern apps, even other free software ones. Do not generalize from FontForge to the rest of the free software world. For some things, such as production operating system kernels and compilers, the open source products leave their proprietary competitors in the dust. In other categories (databases, for example), open source has staked out the low end (MySQL, Postgres), while leaving only the very high-dollar end (Oracle) to the proprietary players. The font software business is totally different because the market is so small. There just isn&rsquo;t a large population of people who both care about the quality of the tool and are able to make big improvements to it. Unlike, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned, the situation with compilers.</p>
<p>But I find myself agreeing strongly with the main point I see articulated on the thread. What&rsquo;s really valuable to the type community is diversity. A few years ago, it wasn&rsquo;t clear there would be <em>any</em> viable font editing programs. Now even the venerable Fontographer is back, and people who do prefer free software for whatever reason also have a usable tool. People on the high end can use the IkarusMaster and family. This is all good. If I were setting out to make a living being a professional font designer and nothing else, I would no doubt just go with FontLab and be happy with it.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see which, if any, of the major font platforms have the flexibility to adopt the Spiro technology, which is another good test of responsiveness. I have no time right now due to personal stuff (I got to spend three hours today with a lawyer, yay), but when I do get time again, I&rsquo;m going to try to get it out there as a Web app, which may turn out to be an important ecological niche. (also, whether a new program succeeds in that niche probably depends more on how important web collaboration turns out to be, and whether the program is well done, much more so than whether it&rsquo;s based on fresh or stale technology, but in any case it ought to be fun to do.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello William &ndash; <cite>FontMaster Utilities are considerably more expensive than the full FontLab. And from the description on your site—and here—they have seemed to be targeted more to foundries than individual type designers.</cite>
<cite>I don’t think many people have seen your tools demonstrated, so I would think for most they are a question mark.</cite></p>
<p>Since the original question was about an inexpensive tool for the first steps into type design, the answer may be TypeTool or FontForge. (I never used FontForge because it requires X11.) For the beginning, I think, the simpler the font editor is, the better. This allows to focus on the essence of what, referring to the technical side, a font is: (a) a collection of glyphs (b) that have space to the left and right side and (c) possibly may be kerned.</p>
<p>As regards FontMaster: Today one doesn&rsquo;t need the entire FM suite to generate font but can do this e.g. with the BezierMaster module, which is about the same price as, or less than, FLS.
Yet the interesting thing about FM of course is batch font generation and the way it deals with OT features. This may not be required for single style fonts, not even for four-style families, but as soon as just a few more weights are involved, it can save time and trouble since one doesn&rsquo;t have to care for every technical setting in every single font. (See the other thread about the horror story cause of a missing hyphen in one style&rsquo;s font name.) I touch a few similarities/differences between FLS and FM <a href="http://www.kltf.de/kltf_notes_concept1.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>As regards other aspects touched in this thread:</p>
<p>As said earlier, FLS&rsquo;s popularity has the effect that people can easily exchange data or tools, and people can help each other. However: All font editors allow to import/export PST1 (or even OT) fonts. So no font editor is an island.</p>
<p>I see two important factors:
(1) The designer must feel comfortable with the drawing tools since she/he spends a lot of time with them.
(2) What matters in the long run are the OTF/TTF files which are finally produced.</p>
<p>When drawing, use whatever tool you like, can afford, etc.
Production is another issue. You can use any of the mentioned font editors to produce fonts. Some examples: FLS only. FLS + AFDKO2, in case you plan to do things that the older AFDKO-version does not support. TypeTool/FontForge + AFDKO, as the least expensive combination. And why not draw in FLS, TypeTool, FontForge and produce with FM, or draw in FM and produce with FLS? Whatever gives the desired results.
When producing fonts, you&rsquo;ll sooner or later change the point of view anyway. You will not ask any more whether it&rsquo;s better to check this or that box in the FLS or FM interface but make up you mind about how the font file and its tables shall look like and wonder, how can I achieve this with the tools at hand? And then it ceases to be an either-or and will turn into a both-and as regards choice of tools. For example, currently my fonts consist of some tables generated by FLS, others generated by AFDKO2, plus additional table tweaks done with FontTools/TTX.</p>
<p>As an aside, even unconventional combinations are possible. InDesign is a good kerning interface, and FontLab Studio and KernMaster work together nicely.</p>

<p>Raph&rsquo;s view here I think confirms that for a beginner the $99 for TypeTool is a better option than Font Forge, unless you are a programmer or the price is prohibitive.</p>
<p>On the Pro end, my impression is that many, like Karsten, use multiple tools to produce their fonts.</p>

<p>what exactly in Raph&rsquo;s comment convinces you to think so? The only negative moment he seems to stress is the fact that FontForge&rsquo;s UI doesn&rsquo;t correspond to the standards of modern apps. Well, I would call this rather an advantage. I never could understand why MS and other large software developers (even open source developers) change the UI of their applications in each new release, although an ideal of good appearance was already achieved in early nineties. For me old style interfaces (like in MS Office 95 or in some old Motif-based applications for Unix) look much more solid and elegant. And indeed I like traditional FontForge&rsquo;s UI very much.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I again need to thank yo folks for some enlightening discussion. Believe it or not&ndash;partly due to being quite busy; unfortunately, not all of it busy-ness connected to making books&ndash;although FontForge is now safely installed and opens just fine, I haven&rsquo;t even had the time to do a tutorial with it. I am beginning to get some sense of the sketches I&rsquo;d like to start making of letterforms.</p>
<p>Would it be advisable to begin sketching on paper or just start up FontForge for a tutorial and see where it takes me? Or should I do some sketching in, say, Adobe Illustrator?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Definitely sketch it out on paper. 
Many designers do start drawing directly in the font design programs, but sometimes those results can wind up looking overly mechanical unless substantial care is taken (see some of my own early works).
Really, though do whatever you&rsquo;re comfortable with.</p>
<p>[[http://briem.ismennt.is/index.htm|Gunnlaugur SE Briem]] has some handy notes on type design, including workflow and tracing sketches, none of which are tied to any particular platform (except maybe the bits about autotracing)..</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The sole problem with Open Source, has always been that the only software that is truly embraced &ndash; is the software that has the most thriving and active community.</p>
<p>In regards to commercial font creation tools &ndash; there are really only two company options available that are worth considering.:</p>
<ul>
<li>FontLab</li>
<li>Font Editor</li>
</ul>
<p>FontLab has a more robust mindset in the professional paradigm, and taking over FOG was a good move. BUT - being a Windows user, I am still a little miffed that there hasn&rsquo;t been a priority placed on getting the memory architecture upgraded and patched for Windows.</p>
<p>Font Editor reminds me more of Macromedia when they started-out years ago. Macromedia were always the kid on the block that understood community support and the value in providing useful and educative resources to their users. Unfortunately, when Adobe took them over, some of that approach was washed in with the mix and degraded a little bit.</p>
<p>Look. The main issue here regarding any platform are two things, really.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Trainability</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t afford it &ndash; chances are, you&rsquo;ll look at something else. If you can&rsquo;t train on it, or train someone within your organization &ndash; chances are, you&rsquo;ll look at something else.</p>
<p>Those are the only two entities that I see having both those factors in mind &ndash; though, FontLab is the higher priced option.</p>
<p>Personally, I think if Open Type were finally treated as the default standard for once, instead of tiering the approach and restricting between apps (TypeTool and ScanFont vs. FontLab, etc) &ndash; then FontLab would have no problem creating more buyers. But, that&rsquo;s just my opinion.</p>
<p>PS:
I&rsquo;m still not willing to get out of my beloved FOG just yet. I would just like to see them update it to standards, and include Open Type support.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m watching a large Python library get rewritten in C++ because of the ~100x performance improvement in certain key areas involving I/O.

<p>Yeah, what is this thing? On my Mac, it simply doesn&rsquo;t work. If the UI functioned as advertised (it does not) it would still be of little value. In my experience a lot of Java(tm) applications are not platform independent, if only because they are not tested on all platforms. It&rsquo;s hard to tell if it&rsquo;s a fake/stub app. or if it actually will function.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thomas: I <em>am</em> a programmer, and if I were doing a font editor as a traditional desktop app, Python is very likely the language I would use.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s slow for some things, but for this application there are a number of factors to mitigate that. First, font editing doesn&rsquo;t require a tremendous amount of actual computation, nor the movement of huge amounts of data. Heck, if Fontographer could work on the 8 MHz Macintosh Plus of 1986 (the year of its first release), even a 100x slowdown would still be reasonable on modern hardware.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the situation is better than that. If you can get the heavy lifting to happen in libraries, it&rsquo;s full speed. The antialiased vector graphic rendering should be done in a cross-platform library such as Cairo, or in the native graphics engine of the OS, such as Quartz. (One frustration for me is that the comparable bindings to the native graphics library aren&rsquo;t as mature on the Windows side as on Linux and Mac, but with luck that situation will improve). Some numeric computation, especially when dealing with vectors and matrices, can also be shuffled into NumPy or SciPy, which are every bit the match for handrolled C++ code.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even possible, though still somewhat cutting edge, to run Python code in the browser. Within the Microsoft world, there&rsquo;s IronPython, which should run inside Silverlight. On the free software side, it&rsquo;s possible that integrating Mono with a browser should provide similar functionality. But none of that stuff is quite ready for prime time yet, so I&rsquo;m doing my Spiro stuff in straight JavaScript (which actually isn&rsquo;t all that different from Python, as a language).</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that Python scales well compared with other scripting languages, but if you&rsquo;re writing hardcore systems-level apps, none of the scripting langauges scale anywhere nearly as well as C or C++. Java is somewhere in the middle of that, and has carved out a good niche for server-side stuff, partly because it supports threading natively. But none of its strengths apply very well to the specific task of font editing. In fact, I don&rsquo;t see anybody in their right mind doing real client side or browser-centric development in Java these days.</p>

<li>RoboFab. It is a set of Python libraries and tools and you have to know how to use it, but it can actually create a very powerful and flexible font production environment (used with FLS or without it).</li>
<li>Superpolator. A tool that nobody should miss if ever working on the font family.</li>
<li>MetricsMachine. Simply the best tool to edit font metrics.</li>
<li>ScanFont. Not just a &ldquo;tracing&rdquo; tool but a very good in converting fonts made as EPS files into real stuff. So draw anywhere, get your font build as a collection of outlines (in a single picture) of any size and convert it into font in few clicks.</li>

<p>Not all of these tools are already released (for both platforms) but it could be a good idea to find a way to try them.</p>

<p>Superpolator vs Multiple Master - in short, Superpolator can take any number of masters on an axis, have any number of axes and place masters at off-axis places. While it won&rsquo;t magically reduce the number of drawings, it allows you to construct different &ldquo;design spaces&rdquo;. For instance 6 masters total, Light, Medium, Black, and then condensed versions each. Any construction &ndash; 9 masters on 3 axes, 4 masters on 1 axis, whatever your design needs. It can recreate any MM design space and then some. Glyph specific masters - you can insert a master for a single glyph if you have to. Superpolator uses the same math as GX variations. Previews, animations, export to pdf.</p>
<p>Multiple master is fixed on 2 master/1 axis, 4 master/2 axes, 8 master/3 axes and I believe even a 16 master/4 axes setup. If your design happens to match that, great. Usually things aren&rsquo;t so neat and need intermediates, fixes for specific glyphs, lots of previewing. In Multiple Master, to get the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; right, the weights that stand to be used most often (most often anyway) you have to work through the extremes. You can&rsquo;t edit the &ldquo;regular&rdquo;, you have to tweak the light and the black to change the middle - this forces the extremes to be a lot less extreme. With Superpolator you could set up light/regular/black on a weight axis. While this means one more master to draw, it&rsquo;s right down to business. The extremes can be more extreme.</p>
<p>Superpolator runs on OSX, is written in Python, and is plenty fast ;) But a lot of people do great work with MM as well. Whatever makes your designs tick.</p>
<p>If you need more info, I have some keynote slides I can send.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for coming on the thread to explain your product.</p>
<p>The fact that Superpolator gives more flexibility than Multiple Masters in doing and modifying the middle and more extreme weights has sold me on it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already done the middles on three optical sizes, as these are the most important, and some heavier and lighter weights, with more to come. It sounds like it will be be extremely helpful as I go forward on the project.</p>
<p>In fact, it even sounds a little fun :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Urm, almost all of what Erik van Blokland ascribes to being the limitations of multiple master fonts are in fact limitations of the existing <em>font editing tools</em> implementation of multiple master fonts. Adobe actually shipped multiple master fonts with intermediate masters (Adobe Jenson), warped design spaces (Kepler MM) and transitional masters for specific glyphs (ITC Garamond MM). I&rsquo;ve even seen an experimental 15-axis MM font with one master plus one master per axis - having masters at corners is not a requirement of the format.</p>
<p>I have no idea how obvious all this was in the published MM specs, but that&rsquo;s kind of a moot point, as the MM format is all but dead for end users. Apps can more easily implement whatever the heck they want as far as how they support design axes, if they don&rsquo;t worry about exporting the result in an MM font. I dearly wish FontLab would sprout more Superpolator-like features in version 6.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Thomas. Technical implementation of MM technology in first spec of the CFF/T2 format (outline part of the OT/PS format) was really powerful and flexible, <em>technically</em> allowing most of the features you can now find in Superpolator.</p>
<p>However, Superpolator is not only a very good font blending machine, it also provides great UI to deal with masters. Highly recommended!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Erik, a case study would be very helpful. I would be more impressed to see what it <cite>has done</cite> rather than to hear what it <cite>could do</cite>.</p>
<p>Is there any type family out there where Superpolator has played a significant role in the design/production? If so, you could write a bit of text with images that demonstrates how Superpolator has saved time (or even improved the final result). For me, that would be more convincing than coloured diagrams.</p>
<p>[edit: just spotted the reference to Amalia. It would be interesting to know exactly how Superpolator was used in its making.]</p>

<p>In his talk at the TDC in spring, in answer to a question Christian said he used RoboFab (or was it RoboFog?) for the many weights of the Guardian fonts, but would use this great new tool Superpolator in the future. So I assume he is using it on current projects.</p>

<p>I wish we had been able to use Superpolator for the Guardian project, but I&rsquo;ve only been working with it since December 2006, long after that project was delivered. I&rsquo;m already at the point where I can&rsquo;t live without it, though. I use it for two main things: the first is rapid prototyping, i.e. taking Headline Regular, Headline Bold, and Text Regular, then extrapolating Text Bold. Not so glamorous, but this was the only way we could have met the almost-impossible deadline for the family we drew for <cite>Público</cite> in Portugal. The extrapolated Text Bold wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it was certainly good enough for our clients to use in prototype pages and even a press test to determine if it worked for emphasis in running text. I will often set up separate axes for different aspects of a family - weight, ascender length, ball terminal size, whatever - and adjust the whole family as needed. If I have a Regular weight with long and short extenders, I can apply the axis to lighter and heavier weights as well. It&rsquo;s very handy. Besides Publico, I&rsquo;ve used these tools for prototyping styles for the serif face that Paul Barnes started and we finished together for <cite>Condé Nast Portfolio</cite> magazine, plus the sans I drew for the same publication, the optical sizes of Giorgio, an additional style of Bosch Serif, and various other projects. It took some time to get used to drawing in a way that yields more usable extrapolations without making the poles bland or unattractive, but I&rsquo;m slowly getting there.</p>
<p>The other thing I use Superpolator for is keeping track of intermediates as I work on a family. I never worked in MM because I tend to work from the middle out, as you&rsquo;ve discussed a little bit here, so I would have to keep separate notes on all of the interpolation values and then reinterpolate each style by hand each time I made a round of corrections to one or more of the poles. This was fine for a small family, but a nightmare for a family like Amplitude, with 3 masters per width, all drawn in Robofog, where interpolating all of the intermediates could easily eat an entire afternoon. With Superpolator, any time I change a master, the change is seamlessly propagated through all intermediate styles. This was a huge help with Publico, Meta Serif, and some projects that I&rsquo;m working on right now. I can also add intermediate masters late in the process, based on the interpolations, so I can fix specific characters (often sans &lsquo;a&rsquo; &lsquo;e&rsquo; &lsquo;g&rsquo; and &rsquo;s'), and these changes instantly affect the styles around them. This was a huge help with both of the families we drew for <cite>Portfolio</cite>, because they covered a lot of ground from light to heavy.</p>
<p>Superpolator&rsquo;s precision makes it a great tool for a production environment, but I also find it really fun to use - especially dragging sliders to make morbidly obese extrapolations.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the detailed explanation, Christian!</p>
<p>It seems that essentially, Superpolator is taking FontLab&rsquo;s Make Master function (which is actually vector addition) to new levels. Sounds great, because Make Master is not very intuitive and not so convenient if you are working on more than one axis.</p>

<ul>

<p>Using this new fontforge feature, Apostolos Syropoulos wrote a free alternative to Cambria Math, called Asana Math [http://openfontlibrary.org/media/files/asyropoulos/219], officially in &ldquo;beta&rdquo; stage. It worked as well as Cambria Math in XeTeX (using unicode-math), but I haven&rsquo;t tried it in Office 2007. Asana is not entirely new; it is based on the TeX math fonts pxfonts, but with a lot of additions.</p>

I will read all the tutorials at fontforge site now.  It&rsquo;s not pasting my imported SVG at baseline zero, so maybe I need to change something in my Illustrator file.  Also some weird green arrows appeared, and I&rsquo;m missing Extrema points, but I don&rsquo;t know why that&rsquo;s important.<br>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A bit late to the party, but the easiest thing to do for non-technical users who want to try FontForge is the following guide. The process is really easy to undo (just check the bottom of this post).</p>
<p>The following process uses open source/free software only and is cross-platform, so both MacOS and Windows users can use this guide (things might be a bit different in MacOS, but it should be easy to find out yourself).</p>
<p><em>Notes:</em></p>
<ul><li>This guide is written with "absolute beginners" in mind, power-users can deviate if they know what they're doing.</li>
<li>The reason I recommend the Mint-DVD at step 1 is that it provides a similar experience to Windows and MacOS out of the box, without having to worry about additional libraries later on.</li>
<li>Both VirtualBox and Mint have 64-bits flavours.</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps to take:</p>
<ol><li>Download the <strong>DVD</strong> of Linux Mint at http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php (warning: 1 gigabyte!)
</li><li>Download VirtualBox at https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
</li><li>Install VirtualBox and run it
</li><li>Create a new Virtual Machine in the "Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager"
   <ul><li>Hit the "New" button</li>
   <li>Hit "Next" in the wizard</li>
   <li>The name is up to you, the OS should be "Linux", the version "Ubuntu"</li>
   <li>Since the defaults on the next pages are okay: keep hitting "Next" until you reach the "Create" button, which you hit as well to close the wizard.
</li></ul></li>
<li>If it hasn't finished yet: wait for the DVD-download to finish. (No need to burn it!)
</li><li>Select the virtual machine you just created at the left and hit start. A new wizard should appear.
</li><li>Hit "Next" and click the folder-image next to the dropdown menu. Browse to the downloaded DVD-image and select it. If you did it right, the dropdown should display "linuxmint-*something*.iso". Hit "Next", then "Start" on the following page.
</li><li>Wait until things stop moving/counting down/polka-dancing and you see a desktop with the icons "Computer", "Home" & "Install Linux Mint"
</li><li>Install Linux. Tutorials on that have to be googled, even though it's a fairly straight-forward process, quite possibly in your own language as well.
</li><li>Once it's installed and running: in the top left corner you see a menu named "Applications". Click it and go to "Other" -> "Software Manager"
</li><li>Once the manager is usable (might take a bit, due to syncing with multiple archives on the net), type "FontForge" in the searchbox (upper right corner).
</li><li>Click "FontForge" once it shows up at the results, hit "Install" on it's information page and accept/confirm your action. It will probably give you a message that additional programs/libraries are needed, but by default they will be downloaded and installed as well.</li>
<li>Once it's been installed (progress bar at the bottom, next to "X ongoing actions"), close the "Software Manager" and you should be able to find/launch FontForge at Applications -> Graphics</li></ol>
<p>If you want to check out other open source graphic programs, search in the Software Manager for:
Inkscape (vector-creation/editing)
gimp (bitmap-creation/editing)</p>
<p>I hope this brings some of you to check it out.</p>
<p>Getting rid of it all is easy:</p>
<ol><li>If the virtual machine (the window with Linux Mint in it) is still running: shut it down (preferably by hitting your username in the top-right corner -> shut down -> shut down, otherwise close window -> power off the machine).
</li><li>Right click on your virtual machine in the "Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager" -> Remove -> Delete all files
</li><li>Uninstall VirtualBox</li></ol></div>

<p>In my opinion everything related to services consists of a combination of two from the following three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>it&rsquo;s cheap</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s good</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s fast</li>

<p>You have to either invest time (1+2 combo) or money (2+3 combo). Although the latter can also be replaced by good karma, for those who take a less legal route to obtain propriety software.</p>

Is there some way to pass from FontLab to FontForge safely? Without creating an OTF file?

<p>FontForge, at least in theory, supports the RoboFab &ldquo;Pen&rdquo; object.</p>
<p>This is a macro which, when run in FontLab Studio, will open a font in FontForge and use the Pen object to transfer the glyph to FLS:</p>
<p><code>from FL import *
import fontforge
from robofab.world import CurrentGlyph
flf = fl.font
fff = fontforge.open(flf.file_name)
ffg = fff[&ldquo;B&rdquo;]
flg = CurrentGlyph()
flpen = flg.getPen()
ffg.draw(flpen)
flg.update()</code></p>
<p>Unfortunately, last time I checked it (some months ago), this code was crashing FontForge a lot, which means that the FontForge implementation of the Pen object was unstable. But, at least in theory, this process should work both ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d love to add support for reading and writing SFD and SFDIR files natively to our next-generation products. I&rsquo;m a strong advocate for this within FontLab, and I&rsquo;d like to see how many people would be interested in having such functionality.</p>
<p>Going through UFO or RoboFab is the safest method at this point, I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>Best,
Adam</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be keeping the company name (FontLab). Our signature product has been FontLab Studio. We haven&rsquo;t announced the new product naming and structure, but the name &ldquo;FontLab&rdquo; will certainly keep on living.</p>

<p>Thank you for the answer. 
For sure more compatibility between font production tools can only be positive.
I personnaly have never used FontForge until recently, but my partner in font design uses it sometimes, particularly for its ability to convert TT curves and hinting.</p>
<p>Can the pen also copy hints in FontForge?
As far as I know, UFO left PS hints at its doors.
I guess it is possible to use the lib, although I have no idea how to do it.
But my partner might…</p>
