  for the credits of Showtime&#39;s &#34;Jeremiah&#34;. <BR>The title font was easy
  &#40;Morpheus&#41; but this one has me stumped. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/62625.gif"
  alt="Showtime&#39;s &#34;Jeremiah&#34; credits"> <BR> <BR>Hopeful thanks!

    target="_blank"> Daniel Midgley&#39;s</a> Du Bellay &#40;manipulated a bit. Large
    caps simply scaled up and so too bold&#41;. His nice Fontor.com website appears

    commercial uses. <BR> <BR>This shows Du Bellay and its companion Italic: <BR>
