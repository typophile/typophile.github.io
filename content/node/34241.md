  a wide variety of print materials, reports, brochures, price lists, etc. Farnham
  may make an occasional appearance as a display/titling face. Something contemporary
  with a nice dose of tradition like Arnhem. Univers is in the running, though something
  with a little more personality would be nice. I've looked at Fresco Sans but not
  sure how that would work with Arnhem and it didn't feel quite right. It would be
  great if the uppercase G matched the tail-less Arnhem G and the K matched how the
  limbs meet the vertical at a point. And if the outer profile of the M was vertical
  instead of inclined ala Myriad. The materials will be related to international development,
  sustainability, and the like. Connotation would be humanist over corporate, classic
  printed Grotesks over computeresque.\r\n\r\nThanks very much."

  body: Fresco Sans would work well, but if you're leaning towards Univers I will
    assume that you would prefer a less humanist sans serif. Try <a href="http://fontshop.com/search/?q=bau&x=0&y=0">FF
    Bau</a> for a more expressive grot, or perhaps <a href="http://vllg.com/Village/GalaxiePolaris/mudTyper+Weights/">Galaxie
    Polaris</a> from Village.

    K features you're looking for.

  body: Rich Hendel, for the <cite>Encyclopedia of North Carolina</cite> used Arnhem
    Blond for the text, and TheSans for much of the display. Worked quite well. Rich
    uses TheSans for a number of titles where he specifies Arnhem Blond for the text
    face; much depends on what kind of book it is, of course.

  body: "I'll echo the recommendation for Benton Sans (or News Gothic), though I've
    always wished Benton had an italic.\r\n\r\nThere are a ton of great faces that
    would pair well with Arnhem, but it's about finding the \"chemistry\" that works
    for your project."

  body: "There certainly are a lot of great faces for the task. Parry Grotesque is
    nice, I just can't abide those curly drooping stroke endings for this project.
    Benton Sans is fantastic and is definitely in the running. Galaxie Polaris is
    a nice face but just doesn't grab me for this project. TheSans is great in some
    aspects, like how the lowercase b is hoisting up its beer belly for the photoshoot.
    I just don't like those inclined \"M\"s for some reason. I've always loved FF
    Bau, and it's certainly a possibility, though it lacks the spring of something
    like Benton Sans, but makes up for it in character, like the eccentric Uncle of
    sanserifs, especially the bolder weights. News Gothic is too condensed in its
    natural state for my taste.\r\n\r\nAnything out there like an FF Bau with a little
    more contemporary snap in its step, or a Benton Sans that listened to a touch
    more Tom Waits?\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your help."
