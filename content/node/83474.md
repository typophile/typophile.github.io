    logo thing \u2013 the rest.)\r\nIn the KNICKERBOCKER GROUP those are fake small
    caps, which I was able to reproduce with Georgia Bold caps, tracked out by 270,
    horizontally-scaled to 85%. I'm done abusing type for tonight but I'm pretty sure
    the rest is Georgia too.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/squoosh_3418.gif]\r\n\r\n(Edit:
    I have no idea why my image is shown so fuzzy. If you do a View Image it looks
    better.)"
