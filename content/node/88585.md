  body: "Almost certainly (based on the dot-matrix ticket printer) this is a typeface
    designed for a computer system that no longer exists.\r\n\r\nMaybe an alternative
    could work? Something like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/mitigate/|Mitigate]]
    is narrow, monospaced and slabby. Or maybe you're after that specific [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3A%22dot+matrix%22/fonts/|dot
