  speaking\" (text).\r\n\r\nJust curious if this is true for everybody's Mac...or
  if Apple's got a wormy one just for me. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Try using whatever you assigned for start speaking again to see if you can get
    the bloody thing to stop. Perhaps that will help you worm your way out of the
    never-ending dialogue :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    things like this happen. The computer is trying to be oh, so helpful and it does
    something it thinks you want. I wish there were just defaults that did nothing
    unless you check the box in preferences which says, \"I like being annoyed with
    stupid random interuptions so please turn all stupid stuff on\".\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    in this case it means, Start Over. \r\n\r\n\"There\u2019s also command-.,...\"\r\nThat
    old cure-all, stopped generally working years ago, and does not work here either.
    \r\n\r\nKind of like some of the leaders of these companies, who would greatly
    benefit from a \"shut-up\" command.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    hose -- can't remember the how exactly (probably because I did it some time ago!),
    but I made it go away permanently.  Look at the Help file: for once, it actually
    does something useful.  ;-)"
