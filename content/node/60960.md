    put U instead. \r\n\r\nMaybe to try with serifs. Oh, yes Bulgari has them :D."

  body: 'Very clean and great looking, but it <em>is</em> for a straight-on Bvlgari
    reference. Both start with BV, both have GA and about the size number of letters,
    very similar in the use of the typeface and black/white palette (which is a minor
    issue obviously). I don''t think changing BV to BU will suffice, the type needs
    to be changed to something completely different to break Bvlgari association.
    Perhaps also consider switching to the lowercase ? '

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_6266.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's funny to see
    how the change of name gets rid of Bvlgari reference. And yes, start with BV does
    make this reference stronger. I don't think that lowercase is answer, especially
    as I want caps and this extended style of typeface.\r\n\r\nRethinking is probably
    the answer. This is exactly design of typeface that I wanted, and also the name
    Butiga that I like so much."

    it more different, more itself with an U instead of V?"
