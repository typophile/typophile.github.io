  this logo?\r\nit needs to read at small sizes and have some of the same dna. i've
  gathered a lot of stuff i thought would fit,\r\nbut i'd like to see if i'm on the
  right track compared to other typophiles. thanks.\r\n-etah chen.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gel_6184.png]"

    garde lower case would be a good choice :)\r\nIn my opinion of course!"

    of \u201Cuncial\u201D /E.\r\nIf it\u2019s just the word EQUIPPED you need, as
    part of the logotype, why don\u2019t you make it in Illustrator, to match the
    GEL letter style? That would take less time than trying out lots of fonts that
    obviously don\u2019t match. It\u2019s not as if there are any tricky letters like
    /S to draw."

  body: I will second Nick's suggestion of drawing it yourself. I would also take
    care to rebalance the current "GEL" letterforms. They appear to be the result
    of some horizontal condensation so either thicken the verticals or lighten the
    horizontals. As it stand now it looks amateurish.
