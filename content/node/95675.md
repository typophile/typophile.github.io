  (they are all png images) and Mercury for texts. I thought to use web font services
  like [[http://www.typotheque.com|Typotheque]], [[http://fontdeck.com|FontDeck]],
  [[https://typekit.com/fonts|TypeKit]] or [[http://www.google.com/webfonts|Google
  Web Fonts]] (that is free!), but I found out that none of these supports Mercury.\r\n\r\nWhich
  alternatives do you suggest? I would like a very contemporary font and I also like
  Mercury's geometry (for example the fact that the horizontal serifs are flat and
  not tapered).\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance."

    Here's an -old- article that might be helpful (second section): http://www.typographer.org/2005_06_01_digests.html\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    you could look for fonts that are \"wedge serif\", which turns up nice stuff like
    this: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/spinoza-pro/\r\n(Noting here that
    FF is top-tier in terms of screen rendering.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
