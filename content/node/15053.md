  body: "Helvetica could be feminine in German for three reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The word
    for writing and/or a typeface (Schrift) is feminine: <strong>die Schrift</strong>.
    In German, Helvetica (or any other typeface name) is often used in context, i.e.,
    <strong>die Helvetica Schrift</strong>\u2026\r\n\r\n2. Helvetica is derived from
    the Latin name of Switzerland, <em>Confederatio Helvetia</em>. In Latin, I think
    I can remember that Helvetia is a first declention noun, and therefore feminine.
    So Helvetica would be feminine because the Latin Helvetia is feminine.\r\n\r\n3.
    Switzerland in German is also feminine, <strong>die Schweiz</strong>, maybe because
    of the Latin root? Not all nation-names are feminine in German, though. Germany
    and France are both neutral (<strong>Deutschland</strong> and <strong>Frankreich</strong>)
    because their suffixes (<strong>Land</strong> and <strong>Reich</strong>) are
    also neutral nouns (<strong>das Land</strong> and <strong>das Reich</strong>\u2026
    country and empire, respectively).\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, at Linotype (where German
    in spoken), all typeface names are feminine. This must be because of reason number
    1, I guess.\r\n\r\nI do not know what the gender of Font is, however."

    that change, and some dont. neu is one that doesnt. "die neue schrift", "der neue
    baum", "das neue buch" (the new font, the new tree, the new book, all three cases
    are the same). i just didnt think about any other adjectives, thats why i wrote
    that (wrong) thing about no cases for adjectives in german.

    believe that natural languages are created by the people who use them, and that
    the ultimate standard is common usage.  So outside of academia, I often end up
    pronouncing non-English words ... \"incorrectly\".  (Growing up in Chicago, I
    referred to a couple of streets named after two famous Europeans artists as Go-thie
    and Mo-zart, even though I knew how to pronounce their names.  It bothers me to
    refer to my favorite Baroque composer without pronouncing the gutteral kh at the

    our \u201Cstandard English\u201D we have learned. So we don\u2019t try to simulate
    how someone in Texas or Georgia or New York would say it, but we would say it
    in English of course. We will certainly NOT apply German pronunciation rules to
    English names. (As some of you do it the other way around.)\r\n\r\nI certainly
    agree that common usage also dictates the right usage and that can mean that proper
    names can take on slightly different pronunciation or for very common foreign
    words even completely new pronunciations. (The names of famous cities are a typical
    example of that.) \r\nBut where does that \u201Ccommon usage\u201D for font names
    come from? What if some say it this way and some say it another way? What is the
    right way then? What happens, when in each and every language the font name is
    pronounced as if it were a word of that local language? THIS would cause endless
    confusion when people from different countries talk to each other.  The best common
    denominator is then to stick close to the original pronunciation. Neue Helvetica
    will then certainly still sound different when Matthew Carter, J.F. Porchez or
    Erik Spiekermann say it, but at least it will be more understandable then when
    every nation has \u201Cinvented\u201D a unique pronunciation. \r\n\r\nSo I see
    some benefit in trying to stick close to the original pronunciation. That collection
    of pronunciations in my blog is more about getting to know the original pronunciations.
