body: "Today, the [[Diacritics Project]] was updated. Diacritics Project is a database
  of information related to diacritics: the correct shape, size and position of each
  accent. There are also lists of accented or special characters used in particular
  languages, historical background, language specific information, useful links etc.
  Many typographers contributed to the open project during last months. \r\n\r\nhttp://diacritics.typo.cz\r\n\r\nNow
  the accents are grouped by a script. The database supports following scripts: Latin,
  Cyrillic, Greek, Sanskrit, and Arabic; other scripts could be added on request.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nI
  would like to invite you to <strong>join the project and to share your knowledge</strong>
  with other typographers.\r\n"

    wish there was more information on the Greek area. I am not well-versed enough
    to contribute in a scholarly manner but I hope others on this list who are will
    contribute.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Chris,\r\nThe Greek area was updated recently by one of the project users.
    Check it! I still need more information about particular languages, about its
    alphabet, typographic rules... But I am not pessimistic; the quality of the information
    is being constantly improved by the users.\r\nFilip"
