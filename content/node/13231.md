  body: The basic tenet of these articles, which appears to be that wacky fonts cause
    kids to behave in a wacky manner, is certainly one of the most bizarre contentions
    I have heard in a long time. Of course, for parents I suppose it is always easier
    to find something (or someone) else to blame for a child's bad behavior.

  body: "I was just amazed that topics about typefaces (fonts as the rest of the world
    commonly misuses) should appear in a forum for new fathers.\r\n\r\nOn the other
    hand, it occurred to me that urban graffiti letter shapes of the sixties have
    evolved into a sort of youth art form commonly associated with hiphop, rap gangs
    and wannabees.\r\n\r\n It was just a matter of time before some \"styles\" were
    available as fonts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://members.chello.se/johan.waldenstrom/fonts11d1.htm\"

    href=\"http://members.chello.se/johan.waldenstrom/font_examples.htm\" target=\"new\">Coca-Cola
    Soundwave campaign.</a>\r\n\r\nJust as with music, art and clothing, each generation
    creates a genre to represent itself. And as always, marketers are there to repackage
    old snake-oil.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\nYes, I'm
    old, but I still wear beads and sandal!"
