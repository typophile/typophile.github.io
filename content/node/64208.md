  body: "I don't like to state the obvious, but if you want to have a hand drawn sans
    serif you have to hand draw it yourself, or find someone to do it for you... :)\r\n\r\nIf,
    on the other hand, you're looking for a typeface that comes close to this one
    or looks hand lettered. You could search for hand lettered in [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/hand+lettered/fonts/|MyFonts]]
    or other font sites. It might give you what you're looking for.\r\n\r\ngreetings
