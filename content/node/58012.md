  license plate that made me think of something:  it appears that the typeface used
  on the words \"North Carolina\" on the plate is the same as the one used in the
  credits from \"The Streets of San Francisco.\"  Whether they are the same or different,
  what is the typeface called?\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina plate:\r\nhttp://www.ricksplates.com/images/archive/nc1984pass.jpg\r\n\r\nThe

  you!\r\n"

  body: "Not sure how that Paratype version differs, but you can get (perhaps) closer
    to the original Advertiser's Gothic, with the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/advertisers-gothic-light/|Monotype
    version]], or the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/advertisers-gothic/|one
    from HiH]], which is the heavier weight.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
