  untrained in typography, I invented my letterforms (and sometimes my spelling) on
  the fly as I hand-cut the silkscreen stencil.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zeus_5014.jpg]\r\nAnd
  here's a logo I made about a month ago for a coffeehouse at my church. The lettering
  is a hand-drawn (in Illustrator) adaptation of Ed Benguiat's Interlock font.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IAATM_4150.jpg]\r\nWhen
  I looked at it, I realized that my idea of coffeehouse typography hasn't changed
  much in the decades since college! "

    rut-pilot). Having a personal style doesn't preclude a lot of steering.\r\n\r\nPut
    another way: if your answer is \"I've always done it that way\" you're probably
    in a rut. If your answer is \"this is what it needs\" you're probably developing
    your style.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For me the newer version seems more evolved and if you never revisit projects
    then you don't learn from them. You can't always be 100% fresh. The goal should
    be to produce the right design for the right piece, if that happens to be similar
    to one done years before, the other day or never before is irrelevant. \r\n\r\nI've
    never put Comic Sans on any pieces I've been in control of and I don't think that
    just because I haven't done that that doing it now will make me a better designer."
