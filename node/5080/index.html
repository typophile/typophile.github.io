  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi All.  <BR>while reading &#34;Schriftkunst&#34; by Adolf Kapr I found an interesting piece of type, by an obviously czech designer called Stanislav Marso - the Marsuv Grotesk. I was searching through google but couldn&#39;t find anything further than his name for about three times nor could I find any digital piece of his work.  <BR> <BR>So you&#39;re my last chance. Has anyone round here Information about this guy and his typefaces - maybe I was just too stupid to find something that is too obvious &#40;Maybe the type is now common under another name or something&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure someone in here can help me. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant is right. The only digital typeface from Stanislav Marso &#40;1910-1975&#41; is RePublic by Brousil. Marso was an employee of Grafotechna, Czech metal type foundry. There are even more typefaces created by him, but you can only find them in old Czech books on type and in some past issues of Typografia magazine. Typografia is a Czech magazine for printers and typographers since 1888; it is now published by son of Mr Marso.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Hrant and Filip. <BR>That was about what I imagined. I think I gonna try to make a revival of that beauty. I&#39;m not quite sure if it&#39;ll work, but trying can&#39;t be a mistake. I have some time off in August, so i&#39;ll start then.  <BR>I&#39;m sure there is someone with similar efforts anywhere, because this is not a specimen I found in the back of an old bookshop. I mean it was in a  pretty popular book.  <BR>There is definitely a lack of popularity for this face. Which, I think, It should definitely earn. <BR> <BR>Down there the spec I saw first &#40;and now am in love with&#41; <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/37595.gif" alt="Marsuv Grotesk"> <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the support guys and sorry for not tuning  in a while. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t spent a single thought on the legal issues yet.&#40;Thanks, Victor, for that hint, how naive can one be, doh!&#41; <BR>But that would be something I sould surely check before starting something like this. It was more of a heart to arm decision than thought about very well. &#40;I don&#39;t know if this was idiomatic but I hope the picture delivers&#41; <BR> <BR>For me the whole thing should be fun at first.I didn&#39;t have any commercial issues in background. To be able to sell something like that, I&#39;d surely  need to have the original metal. Since I&#39;m surely not able to pay for these, the aspect of making money with it is out of play. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t really know it from original source, but at least in the U.S. it seems to be only the name is under copyright protection. How else so many derivates for popoular fonts would have been developed. &#40;I don&#39;t tell no company names&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll check about the legal issues. But it would be a pity if this shouldn&#39;t work. <BR> <BR>Servus <BR> <BR>Dominik <BR></div>
