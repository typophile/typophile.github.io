  body: I'd like to know this too. I've seen it several times, and I'm thinking it
    has to do with how Adobe converts the output to pdf. On the other hand, if I remember
    correctly, it prints out fine, so it may have to do with how it's displayed on
    screen.

  body: An idea. If you have photoshop access to the file, try moving the character
    a half pixel to the left or right. That may add anti-aliasing to make them look
    the same.
