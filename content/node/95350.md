  trying to work the font used in this old logo. It was originally created in the
  70's so I'm not even sure if the font will have been digitised or not... maybe someone
  can shed some light on it? :)\r\n\r\nMyfonts.com came up with these:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/eurotypo/atenea-egyptian/italic/
  (pretty close)\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/presencetypo/placebo-serif/italic/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/glypha/bold-oblique/\r\n\r\n.....but
  none of them are quite correct. "

    but its certainly the closest I've seen (the 'a' isn't correct). However, though
    I'd like the actual font I actually only really need to create a vector of the
    logo, so that font should help!"
