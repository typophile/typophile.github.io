  body: "Just as in that previous thread I again searched the Sans Guide; and also
    used Identifont and some MyFonts searching, without any luck. This is not the
    same font as that earlier thread, as Patty noted, but the odd W is similar. The
    oblong G and high-crotch M are not so common, so it ought to be a simple enough
    thing to find, but it must be from an obscure source.\r\n\r\nI'm getting tired
    of getting stumped.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I just found one that I think could be made to look like this lettering by
    outlning it with a white stroke. If I were trying to match this and running out
    of time, maybe this is the font I'd use:  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typewerk/td-bastard/|tdBastard
    Mono]] from Typewerk. Maybe add a little bit of squooshing(tm) and I think it
    might fool you if you weren't examining them side by side.\r\n\r\nI think I've
    had enough of this 'fun' after going more than 1/3 of the way through the 2400
    sans serif fonts in the MyFonts collection.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I came across this a while ago in the AIGA archives, the type caught my eye
    then. After searching for it again, the  blurb states that the typeface used is
    'Historic, found type'. I know this doesn't ID it... but it will probably save
    everybody searching for a digital version.\r\n\r\nCheck out the info:\r\n\r\nhttp://designarchives.aiga.org/?s1=2|s2=1|eid=7745"

  body: " Maybe Georg (\"Bleisetzer\") has it in his collection of metal types.\r\n\r\nThe
    other point to make is that many digital typefaces have their origins in typefaces
    like this -- they are not all original designs, by any means -- so it is never
    a waste of time to check the font libraries.  However, I found one that would
    have been close enough (for me) if I was trying to reproduce this (with some tweaking),
    so I stopped.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
