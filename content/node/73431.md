  Musical'' is a vivid hand drawn font with 405 alternate letters, all caps. Developed
  from a lighthearted drawing in my sketchbook saying the German word MUSIK cheerfully
  over and over in twenty vivid variations. Next to it was the date \"6th April 2007.\"
  This initial idea has burst into a font that is full of surprises and whimsical
  turns. It is dynamically suggestive, like music, and humorously chaotic, as in Dada.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whimsical_musical_sketchbook_4837.jpg]\r\n<br/>\r\nEach
  uppercase letter is enriched with ten stylistic alternates to create a heap of playful
  variations amounting to a mountain of possibilities. Recommended for display usage:
  gonzo headlines, fantastical picturesque covers, extravagant quirky flyers, chichi
  posters, individual labels and fun logos.\r\n \r\n[[http://bit.ly/whimmusic|http://bit.ly/whimmusic]]\r\n\r\nMore
