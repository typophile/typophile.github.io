body: When testing the spacing of caps, should I test them out with no tracking because
  so many people will set them like that anyway? Or should I be testing my caps with
  +10 or +20 units of tracking to make sure that they look good set that way and still
  work with the lowercase?

    settings tracking the font out should be fine. Ultimately the regular setting
    must be correct anyway. '

  body: "If your font is to be used for setting text, the caps should be spaced to
    work with lower-case letters, punctuation, and especially the default word space.
    The caps have to look correct in a normal sentence, which can include initials
    such as \"H. L. Mencken had a wicked wit\", as well as other constructions.\r\n\r\nMoreover,
    the amount you letterspace full or small caps depends on how many words are involved,
    and the wordspacing values too will vary, depending on the number of words. Try
    it -- set \r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE \r\n\r\n& get it feeing correct. Then set something
    longer, such as \r\n\r\nTHE INTERMITTENT CHATTERING OF SMALL FURRY ANIMALS, AND
    BIRDS.\r\n\r\nI believe you will find that you pick different values. The type
    designer cannot function as the compositor, for the simple reason that s/he cannot
    specify the text to be set."

    frequent and must work well. Good type setters setting all caps know how to space
    given the context. Bad typesetters don't know and don't notice that they don't
    know. It is too hard to be a mind reader.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
