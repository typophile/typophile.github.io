  soundtrack CDs released by Toei Music Publishing (Japan) in the mid-1990s.\r\n\r\n\u2022\_The
  italic used for the film titles \u2013 \"Zerkalo\" and \"Stalker\".\r\n\u2022\_The
  bold condensed grotesk used for \"Andrey Tarkovsky\" (possibly Akzidenz Bold Condensed?)\r\n\u2022\_The
  glittery number \"4\"\r\n\u2022\_The typewriter font used for the glittery Cyrillic
  version of \"Tarkovsky\"\r\n\r\nI have a couple more images from other CDs in this
  series if anybody needs extra letters or numbers to work with, but they are a bit
  more blurry than this one.\r\n\r\nI know it's a lot to ask, so thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iz_69_3_orig_3767.jpg]"

  body: "To start, the 4 is Bodoni, or some clone...\r\n\r\nZerkalo-Stalker looks
    like a faux-italic (ultra-slanty), squooshed garamond (hook at the end of the
    leg of lowercase k)\r\n\r\nIt's not AG bold condensed (descender on y is too stubby,
    arm on k doesn't look right). Perhaps Helvetica Black Condensed?\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/12573/helveticablackcondensed-font.html\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the help. \r\nIt hadn't occurred to me that it might be Helvetica.
    I'm obviously a bit slow this morning. \r\n\r\nI had a feeling that extra slanting
    and a bit of squooshing may have taken place, because Garamond and Plantin italics
    \r\nwere looking pretty 'upright' in comparison.\r\n\r\nAndrew \r\n"

  body: "James, I don't think it's Helvetica Compressed. That variance has a different
    lowercase r. The ear points downward. I think black condensed looks closer.\r\n\r\nI'm
    tapped out on the cyrillic."

    Elementa]] is close.

    seen it before.\r\n\r\nI'll keep looking for the typewriter font and I'll do some
    squooshing experiments with Garamond (shudder)."

  body: The K is interesting. You have a hint of ball serifs and a particular flavor
    that is not common in typewriter fonts.
