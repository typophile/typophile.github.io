body: "I'm not sure if this has been discussed before or not, but I have been thinking
  about this a bit.\r\n\r\nWhen somebody says something about a letter or glyph, they
  say something like \"this lowercase a needs some work\", and I get the meaning just
  fine. In writing, though, for some reason we feel like there needs to be some added
  emphasis, whether it be quotes, slashes, or italics. I've used all of them at one
  time or another. But I think it's unnecessary. And with non-alphabets or non-latin
  glyphs, it's even more obvious.\r\n\r\nSo rather than say,\r\n\u2014I think your
  'a' is too wonky.\r\n\u2014I think your /a/ is too wonky.\r\n\u2014I think your
  <strong>a</strong> is too wonky.\r\n\u2014I think your \xABa\xBB is too wonky.\r\nI
  say:\r\n\u2014I think your a is too wonky.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is simpler and still
  makes sense, right?"

    especially when you have to add a possessive (like \"the \xABa\xBB's top\") and
    I mean for any kind of quoting*. It's just that they're a hassle to type. The
    slashes seem dorky (although I guess one is not as bad as two). So I just use
    double quotes.\r\n\r\n* In fact Nina and I made it part of Armenotype's house

    can save money by using an upside-down comma as an opening quote... I can sympathize
    with their motivation.\r\n\r\nNow that we're no longer using little pieces of
    lead-tin-antimony alloy (mustn't forget that other element, riding in its triumphal
    chariot... and, for that matter, the small amounts of other elements such as copper
    as well), maybe it might be considered appropriate to revisit this. But when people
    are used to something, changing it will be resisted as an impediment to quick
    reading.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's not as if ordinary people notice Bodoni's quotes
    and are confused by them - or even have trouble with typewriter quotes. So people

    get what you mean, but that could still be confused as R/s (arr slash ess, arr

    to be confused or misunderstood. That's why I'd like to remove declaration or
    bracketing and use wording to mark with. Is \"I love the R.\" confusing at all?
    Especially when prefixed with \"uppercase\" or \"lowercase\", it's not really
    ambiguous. Even if we came up with a great declaration system, bad writing still
