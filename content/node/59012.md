  \"font identification\".  I tried many of the online identification systems but
  to no avail.\r\n\r\nWe are looking to add more buttons to our site but can't find
  this font to match.  The guy who developed the buttons for us is long gone, can't
  contact him.\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated!  I will post a variety of
  the buttons so you can see as many characters as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks again for
  any help you might have."

    among their nearly 500 bitmap fonts. If it's not a bitmap font, it's so small
    it's hard to get a good idea what to look for.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    find.  Most likely, I will have to make all new buttons with a font that I hang
    on to!\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nFrom an amateur letterer, this is a great site!"
