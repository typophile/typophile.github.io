  Week</a>, specifically the thread on <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16343?from=50&comments_per_page=50\">WTF
  ligatures</a>.\r\n\u2018The marvellous blog[!] typophile.com recently[!] ran a hypothetical
  exercise imagining what ligatures and letter-symbols we would have created had current
  phrases been prevalent before keyboards were truly established. It\u2019s remarkable
  what distracted typographers can produce to symbolise LOL or WTF or my favourite
  RTFM. Of course, what we really need is a ligature for www (w3?) or even http://.\u2019\r\n\r\nPictured
  are Lex\u2019 and gmckenzi\u2019s RTFMs and Daminox\u2019, Mark Simonson\u2019s,
  Cerulean\u2019s and Ikean\u2019s WTFs (And Mrs Eaves, the article is about ligatures
  and swash characters and their recent use).\r\nTim\r\n"
