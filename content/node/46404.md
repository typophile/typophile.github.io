  brought up before.  At another forum I go to someone started a thread on which is
  more readable, serif or sans.  Someone mentioned they like sans better but that
  a true sans face wouldn't have bars on the I like the face used for text on that
  forum\u2014that face being Verdana, btw.\r\n\r\nTo which I, without thinking, replied
  that, no, the bars are not serifs.\r\n\r\nAnd then someone questioned me as to <em>why</em>
  the bars aren't considered serifs and I had absolutely no idea how to answer him
  despite wasting almost an hour trying to come up with an answer.  My google-fu even
  failed me.  The only thing I could come up with was that the bars are a design decision
  to help differentiate the I from an l and that serifs are traditional terminal whearas
  these are the same weight as the rest of the letter and are squared off but that
  still doesn't answer whether or not they are or aren't serifs.\r\n\r\nSo, I ask:
  in a sans serif face are bars on a capital I considered serifs and if not why?  With
  a bonus question: the j in Verdana has what appears to be a serif but is it?\r\n\r\nThanks"
