body: I work for an automotive group and we just bought a new dealership, so there
  are 8 total. I'm having the hardest time trying to figure out what fonts we have
  in our logos so I can make them all the same. They were designed by one of our vendors,
  who says that due to the formatting, they can't figure out what font the designer
  used (who is no longer employed with their company). Can anyone help me out? I need
  to know the names of the fonts for the dealership names, not the part that says
  Chevrolet. I would really appreciate any wisdom anyone has to offer. Thank you!

    they can't figure out what font the designer used \r\n\r\nThey don't sound very
    professional. Most professional designers keep file copies of every job. There's
    no need to \"figure out\" what font was used, they open the file and the software
    tells them exactly what font was used.\r\n\r\n> so I can make them all the same\r\n\r\nIf
    you're making them all the same, is it necessary to match what was done previously?
    Might be a good opportunity to update your logos."
