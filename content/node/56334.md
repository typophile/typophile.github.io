body: "Hi all (and especially Adam or Nick, if you're here ;)\r\n\r\nAnyone know when
  MyFonts will update their sample renderer to use (GPOS) class kerning for the samples?\r\nOr
  should I re-generate my fonts to include expanded old-style \"kern\" tables just
  to make the samples on MyFonts look good? (With the added benefit of them perhaps
  better supporting older applications kerning-wise?)\r\n\r\nMy \"problem\" at the
  moment is:\r\nI have just released a batch of fonts on MyFonts.\r\nA foundry's best
  selling font is used for the header on the foundry page.\r\nMy current best seller
  is a font called \"Dynamic BRK Pro\", and its design means that without class kerning
  applied my foundry name reads like \"CheapP roF  onts\"!\r\nIt does not look good,
  and I'm afraid customers will think my fonts actually HAVE such abysmal kerning
  (which they don't)...\r\n\r\nHence my question.\r\n\r\nSo... Should I wait for MyFonts
  to improve their sample engine, or should I put \"legacy\" information in my fonts?"
