  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Yeah if this is for a rock
    concert, a book, a movie, it could make a great, beautiful mark. I think your
    drawing is well done. If this is for babies, you might want to soften it up a
    bit, cause it kinda wants to kill me.  <BR>Context is key. <BR>Though it does
    look good. <BR> <BR>Aaron&#60;/font&#62; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>oh man, that would
    be an AWESOME concert!'

  body: on a purely technical standpoint, i think you might wanna iron out those kinks
    in your swashies. As they are now they look a little mechanical/inorganic. I think
    some nice smooth swashes would give great balance to the heavily angular letters.
    just my two bits.

  body: Thanks for the comments.  Yes, I want to get all of the kinks ironed out in
    the swashes - good point.  What I&#39;m really concerned with is trying to figure
    out the &#34;logic&#34; of the letters and how they relate to each other.  I want
    to make sure all of the letters follow the same rules and look like they came
    from the same typeface - that is, of course, except for the capital &#34;B&#34;
    and &#34;S&#34;. <BR> <BR>The client is a design agency and they want the logo
    to look like a cigar box logo - not for kids!

  body: The E seems to be out place.  It&#39;s missing some spurs and curves.  The
    capital B is also somewhat difficult the to read. <BR> <BR>I recommend busting
    out some circles and perfecting those curves as well.
