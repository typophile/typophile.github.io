body: I have a logo for which I'm trying to track down the original typeface. It's
  reminiscent of something I've seen but I can't place it and am unable to get in

    don't think there are italics for these faces, so the upper- and lowercase version
    must be artificially italicized."

  body: Thanks! I thought immediately that the italics were an Illustrator manipulation.
    Appreciate the help.
