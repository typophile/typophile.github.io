		<div class="commentbody"> All of Gill&#39;s lowercase &#39;p&#39; are delicious, although I tend to love his cap Florentine &#39;R&#39;, especially in Perpetua. I agree with Joe on the italics as well. It was the &#34;humanizing&#34; of the face that makes it so beautiful, in my humble opinion. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure it has been &#39;proved&#39; that Gill Sans derived from Johnston&#39;s face. I&#39;m not arguing it didn&#39;t. Gill was in on the design of the Johnston face for the first three &#40;or so&#41; meetings. Johnston&#39;s face suffers from too much geometry in the wrong places and Gill avoided this with the humanist approach. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure I entirely agree &#40;or disagree&#41; that the English design the best faces. What about the French? I&#39;ve come to appreciate the beautiful eccentricities, and I mean that as a compliment, of the lettering styles of the earlier part of the 20th century. I never did appreciate those faces, such as Choc and Vendome, until listening to Gerard Unger&#39;s seminar on French design. By the way, does anyone know of where I might find more information on Roger Excoffon? Preferably in English, but my brother speaks French. </div>

High five to Gill for doing a humanized sans serif, though.

I have to say that Gill Sans, run in all caps is probably the worst instance of what you&#39;re talking about. &#40;In other words, if you want that monumental feeling you can only get from all caps, perhaps you should choose a different face&#41;. <BR> <BR>But I will forever regard the Gill Sans italics as pure genius. <BR> <BR>A logotype I created once upon a time. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/370.gif" ALT="apg-us_logo_color.gif"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can&#39;t say what Gill was thinking, but I can point out some design issues for which that might seem like a reasonable solution. <BR> <BR>When a font weight gets that heavy, it is helpful to increase the x-height, allowing heavier horizontal strokes in letters with several horizontals such as a and e. <BR> <BR>However, once you get a really large x-height, if the i dot is to maintain an appropriate relative weight, it ends up above the descender height! Something has to give. One solution might be to make the linear part of the i much shorter than the x-height. Having tried this, I think at the extremes &#40;Gill Ultra/Kayo&#41;, it looks as goofy as the miniaturized dot, because the main part of the i ends up so far below the x-height. So it becomes a question of which aspect of the design has to &#34;give.&#34; <BR> <BR>My $.02, anyway. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There was a version of Gill Sans made for timetables &#40;Monotype - I think&#41; - uppercase and numerals only, monospaced bold and regular, the uppercase was used for footnotes and did not have &#34;I&#34; or &#34;O&#34; to avoid any confusion - I believe it was only available in 6 or 6.5pt to be used with ordinary Gill Sans for destinations etc. btw I didn&#39;t know any English type designers designed cars.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I also like Gill Sans to an extent, and have found it so eye catching, its so identifiable. Only thing I have never been crazy on is the inconsistancies across the different weights, so I prefer to stick with the roman and italic. I am gonna have to aree with hrant also about the lc italic p :). If I am not mistaken, Gill only designed one weight? and the digital versions build off of his normal weight?
