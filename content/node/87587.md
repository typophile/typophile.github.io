    Century Bold]], perhaps?\r\n\r\nEDIT: very nearly but not quite... Strange, the
    digital versions all seem to have flat bases to the 'v' and 'w', but the printed
    sample I've got has pointed bases, just like your image. So I really think it
    is <em>some sort</em> of 20th Century... just: whose version?"

  body: Having trouble finding the 20th Century version that has a quotation mark
    and apostrophe like in the sample. Any other ideas?

    family font. Futura Serie BQ w/ alternate quotation marks and apostrophe, perhaps?"

  body: Futura's definitely better for the quote marks. The Vs and Ws in Futuras all
    seem to go from pointed-base to flat-base in bold, too (along with the tops of
    A and N). Strange.
