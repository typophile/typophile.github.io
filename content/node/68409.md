  piece of software that generates lettershapes based on a skeleton, by turning knobs
  on a machine I built. \r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/67309]]. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  best comment on this topic was:\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n\"...Can't help thinking
  a pure software/mouse version would be easier, but then it wouldn't be as much fun.\"\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSince
  then I've been rewriting it to use online. \r\n\r\nI placed it on a website:    [[http://www.haagseletters.nl]]\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    an interface using knobs for some aspect of it."
