    or Office</a> or OS X. Ascender didn't infect the world with Impact, that happened
    long before they bought the rights to license it to other chumps.

    fonts with software is to be expected, and Windows et al have an adequate range

    context, ie a cartoon speech bubble and not a business letter or funeral service.\r\n\r\nArial

  body: "Cool, Chris. I'll check out that thread.\r\n\r\nOn font bundling, sure the
    mere availability of computer-based fonts allows for misuse. But that's true for
    every creative application ever sold for a computer -at least one that was priced
    at any somewhat affordable level. What do we do about it? Price fonts and any
    application that can handle them well out of reach of most people?\r\n\r\nI'll
    offer what I think is the root of the problem: our education system.\r\n\r\nThere
    were penmanship courses in the past. Sometimes the garden variety art course in
    high school would delve into calligraphy. High schools have taught typing. But
    what are they doing that is appropriate for today? I think schools need to offer
    some basic page layout courses that include some basic coverage of typography.\r\n\r\nJust
    from the simple standpoint of putting together a r\xE9sum\xE9 regular people aren't
    given much of a clue on what is appropriate for business communication. They are
    left on their own to guess.\r\n\r\nEven if operating systems and office productivity
    suites had their font bundles removed, we would still see lots of bad type happening.\r\n\r\nA
    lady I know who makes banners and other \"fast sign\" stuff in my town has really
    horrid taste in type. But she has fun doing what she's doing and other people
    are stupid enough to pay her for it. The awful nature of her work comes from a
    lack of design sense (or talent for that matter) in knowing what kind of fonts
    can work well with each other. She downloads lots of freeware fonts at various
    free font sites and comes up with some really strange combinations.\r\n\r\nI think
    most people know good typography when they see it. They know the page looks better,
    but don't know how to break down the mechanics on why the page looks better.\r\n\r\nIn
    the end good designers have to look at the situation as being more of an opportunity
    rather than a problem, work harder and use the imbalance to get more work for
    themselves. The most loyal customers tend to be the ones who are educated enough
    to understand the difference."

  body: Maybe this is just a case of something being popular because it's good, or
    bundled because its popular? I like some of stephen's suggestions but none of
    them quite thump you in the head the way Impact does. Well maybe Compacta but
    it's not as readable. the Impact ampersand is rubbish though. House Gothic is
    quite cool too even though it's a bit disco for my everyday work. (and Squeeze
    looks like a naff version of it.)

    here will say fonts should not be bundled.\r\n\r\nI like it when fonts come in
    all four weights. The most overly used bundled font is probably Zapf Chancery,
    which most people think is a script, since it was bundled without the romans and
    the italics in other weights. It's a fine font, if you can avoid overuse of the
    italic weight everyone is so familiar with.\r\n\r\nBut I got one of the Shelley
    fonts bundled in an Adobe product once. There just isn't a roman version, and
    it would be silly to think of one. \r\n\r\nDisplay fonts, traditionally, come
