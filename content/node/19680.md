  up with a thread about the typeface: luxury, which is about a exhorbitantly priced
  typeface that might not even exist.\r\n\r\nWould anyone be kind enough to throw
  up some suggestions?\r\n\r\n"

    be so many things. What is your product?

    body: I agree with Tiffany. I would also say that to create a real luxury brand
      ( which must by definition be unique in some way) requires vision & innovation.
      To steal the style of existing luxury brands past or present is as easy as recognizing
      their formula & using it or using it with a twist. There is of course some room
      inbetween & no pure state per se. However I think it's best to stick to what
      Tiffany is talking about - creating a new idea of luxury that is aware of &
      builds on history instead of wallowing in it.

  body: "The thin 'sexy' lines of Neue Helvetica Ultra Light is often used to convey
    luxury. And generally speaking the whole entire family of Helvetica is a good
    choice.\r\n\r\nBickham Script is definitely opulent. Optima connotes clean classic
    chiseled lines.\r\nI see Didot used at Saks all the time (Bodoni too).\r\n\r\nITC
    Blair, Petras Script, and Mrs. Eves are also really excellent choices. \r\n\r\nThere
    are about 5 billion other fonts that can convey a sense of luxury too, the key
    is the how will you use the fonts.\r\n\r\nAppropriate color harmony, granular
    adherence to the rules of typography, print material, and numerous other factors
    have play in the success of your project.\r\n\r\nWhat is your application?\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "There's also typography, the careful, artful and stylish USE of a carefully
    chosen typeface in conjunction with the specific imagery to convey an overall
    luxurious feeling. Even the most pedestrian typefaces, depending on the context,
    can be used in this way. You might be surprised to find Avant Garde, Helvetica
    and Times in use by extremely high-end merchants.\r\n\r\nTake a look at some of
    the current magazines hawking jewelry, perfume, shoes and fashions. Tiffany is
    right; it could be almost anything. There are a lot of esthetic codes to play
    off of and it would probably be misleading to suggest specific typefaces unless
    the other elements are present. \r\n\r\nDo you have a product? Does it contribute
    anything to the mystique and perceived value of the advertisement? \r\n\r\nLuxury,
    the typeface, does exist. It happens to be very exclusive, that's all. If you
    have to ask the price, well.... \r\n\r\n;D"

  body: "Thanks for the very helpful responses. \r\n\r\nBefore posting I did look
    a some car brands but there wasn't really any consistency in the type of typography
    that would be usually associated with luxury.\r\n\r\nThe product is photography
    services; something that isn't always considered as a luxury.\r\n\r\nAs with color
    combinations; I was thinking any saturated vibrant colors wouldn't convey that
    feeling. But sticking to a monochromatic scale of colors would probably best.\r\n\r\nI'll
    agree that luxury has to be a brand identity that is built with sucessful marketing
    positioning and strategy; but in my humble opinion, creating beautiful typography
    to give that perception is a good foundation with branding every piece of literature
    with consistant typography and design."

  body: "personally if i think about luxury brand logos (normally fashion brands),
    it's usually an all text logo, black text on white, usuall all caps, usually with
    loose tracking between the letters and fairly often high contrast serif typefaces
    (think Bodoni), or thin/light typeface at least.\r\n\r\njust look at the logos
    of these brands: Armani, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Calvin Klein, Chanel, Christian
    Dior, Fendi, Ferragamo, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Prada, Versace,
    Yves St. Laurent, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nof course, going that direction isn't exactly
    new and fresh, but i'd say that's how you emulate the luxury brand look.. and
    if it's a logo for a single photographer then it might work as the name of the
    person becomes the brand name, much like it usually is for fashion brands."

  body: "Since it is for  the photography industry, I was thinking something art deco
    inspired yet accompanied by a flexible font family that can meet any challenge
    you could throw at it. Logos, signage, web, and print.\r\n\r\nMy choice is Neutraface
    from House Industries. I can totally see this typeface being used to convey luxury
    for the photography industry.\r\n\r\nAnd then again, my second choice is Neue
    Helvetica matched with some other gothic/grot.\r\n\r\nIs this a high end processing
    lab, a studio, what??? Who are the clientele? Are they young or old? Where are
    you located? The point... there are different kinds of luxury. Classic, Sexy,
    Young/Trendy, Minimal, Rococo etc. Provide more info so I can help you better
    (if I'm helping at all ;O)\r\n\r\nAs far as trying to develop new ideas on luxury
    or some other 'revolutionary' kinda thing... forget all that! If you do look at
    all (and I do mean all) the top luxury brands. They all follow a similar formula
    for conveying luxury. Trying to reinvent the wheel is not necessary. The general
    public expects things to look a certain way in terms of luxury. Cliche- maybe-
    but it works.\r\n\r\nThin, sparse, sexy are mantras for luxury. And like you said
    consistent typography is the key.\r\n\r\nHope I'm Helping,\r\n\r\nMikey"

    Atdelphian open seems like the engraved style i'm looking for. \r\nIs there any
    font that looks like that but isn't all caps?\r\n\r\nI'm really liking Nuetraface.
    It's definately a beautiful font. That and in combination with an engraved font
    for large headers would go beautifully. I'm looking for something like Zaragoza
    that shows some personality. I don't know"

    some customers. ATdelphnia is a nice one... I have to look at it more closely.
    As far as Zaragosa- NO!!! I don't like that at all. It looks dated for what your
    going for. On its own... very nice but what you are going for- survey says \"X\"
    \     :(\r\n\r\nFF Acanthus Open is the one you want... classic, clean, and very
    upscale. Or perhaps Scala Jewel. I'm gonna look into open faced type... I'll get
    back to you on that.\r\n\r\nLook at these web sites: http://www.viceroysantamonica.com/
