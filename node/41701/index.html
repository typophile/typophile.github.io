  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've been offered a new design position at a worldwide company. This would require relocating a few hours away, which is fine, and they've offered me nearly 30% more than I make now. All good yes, but the problem with said job is........... they only design on PC's and use Quark. Being a person who has only designed on Macs and is mostly familiar with InDesign, the thought of this scares me. 

The idea of working on a PC is making me about 95% sure I don't want to take this job. 

What would you do?
New job, more money, PC, Quark
Old job, less money, Mac, InDesign</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Have you asked if they'd be willing to let you work on a mac? It's not out of the question to ask. I've asked what kind of computers and software companies use at interviews and, if they are using old equipment I try to see if they'll be upgrading or willing to as part of the job.

If it's a worldwide company with design departments spread around the globe I can see the logic of what they are doing. They probably invested heavily into one system and software to cut down on compatibility issues years ago and kept up with it.

Myself, I much prefer working on a Mac, because i know the OS and hot keys; but Windows isn't all that bad, just different. If it was a design studio using just PC's I might be a little more hesitant. </div>

You can drag icons to the start button to add them to the first pop-up when you hit the window key. Or drag them to the toolbar down where you probably already see the IE icon.

You can fill the toolbar up with icons if you want (you might have to unlock the toolbar). You just have less room to see what is open.

I have been a Windows user all my life, and just switched to Mac. I have never used Vista, and I have heard complaints, but suffice to say, you'll be probably be OK and live to tell about it.</div>

I'm not a designer, but I wouldn't turn down a job just because I had to use Windows rather than OS X.  If that's the only thing holding you back, take the job, figure out which of your co-workers are the gurus and let them know that you're quite competent with OS X and InDesign but need to get quickly up to speed on Windows and Quark.  They'll steer you in the right direction, and it will be a good way to break the ice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">PC might be a deal-breaker for me, but Quark is OK, you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly if you know your way around InDesign. Despite what others have said above, Quark is a very solid design/layout program. I know InD lets you import your keyboard shortcuts from Quark (which was a HUGE help to me since I learned Quark way first) but I'm not sure it works the other way around. In any event, intuitively the programs are very similar and Quark even has a few features sorely lacking in InDesign such as customized kerning tables, very important for type purists.</div>

<strong>Come over to the Dark Side, Katherine!</strong>  ;-D

I kid. I spent several years working only with Macs. And then, one day, I started a job where each designer had a Mac <em>and</em> a PC. At first it was troublesome, but pretty soon I got the hang of it. I am no longer at that job, but learning how to use a Windows machine was helpful. I still prefer Macs, though (sorry, Darth).

As for QuarkXPress, back in Version 3.x days, the Windows version was awful. Nowadays it is pretty similar to its Mac counterpart. I too have my InDesign keyboard shortcuts set to the Quark 4 shortcuts! But you can't set Quark to InDesign shortcuts... Sorry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just did the "switch" to mac due to a new job... I worked on macs while being at university, then "returned" to windows (XP) because it still felt more natural to me (it's all about being used to a system), and now I returned to OSX again...
I did Indesign, xPress, Illu, Photoshop, HTML-Coding, making books, marketing material, fonts and everyday work on the system, and it was very reliable and in 5 years there were no compatibility issues with printing services, fonts, or when exchanging data with other windows- or osx-machines. So: it works.

After one week on OSX, I am at about lets say 60% of my usual working speed, but I am slowly getting used to it, adjusting the system and getting used to it. I've learned that one has to tweak OSX as well as one has to tweak Windows, out of the box both of them are hard to get used to if you compare it to a machine fully adjusted to your needs you used before. So if you give Windows a chance, it's possible to work with, but don't be frustrated in the beginning...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For me the switch over from mac to pc would be a small issue, but not big enough not to do it. I'd be more uncomfortable with the application change. Having said that, it wouldn't be that difficult to adjust, it's only platform/software after all! I've worked with both platforms and both applications, and it's just a question of getting used to it. If everything else about the new job and other circumstances (move etc) are just about perfect, I'd go for it.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm another one who thinks the platform isn't nearly as big a question as what application you run on it. The transition between QuarkXPress and InDesign (in either direction) seems like a bigger deal to me than the platform switch. But I can't promise you'd feel the same way.

Now I can imagine switching back to Mac (I am familiar with both systems, although I spent 95 percent of my time in front of a Windows Vista machine) but I would never switch to XPress again.

		<div class="commentbody">When I interviewed for this job 9.5 years ago, one question was "What kind of computer do you work on and what software do you use?" My immediate answer, given with no hesitation was "I work on a Macintosh and use Quark. But I'll learn whatever machine/software you folks use here." I did know that my predecessor used used Windows and Quark [InDesign was just a glimmer then].

I had never even sat at a Windows machine. But I knew I was smart enough and nimble enough to make the machine switch. And I wanted the job: the type of work, the added money, the new responsibilities, the shorter commute.

These are the sort of things you should think about. They are not asking you to switch religion [I hope], or to get rid of your dog and get a cat. It is just a damn machine.

Think through what you really want. Machines and software can be mastered.

powers

PS: I was offered the job. Before the offer was made, the Managing Editor talked with other book designers and found that Mac / Quark was the preferred combination. On the day she asked me to come to work here she also said "Give me a Macintosh shopping list." So in the end I had not to make the switch. But I was ready, and I like to think that honest willingness to shift was a factor.

Still using Quark.</div>

I think most of the people here who have mentioned they like or would find the move to Quark easy are those who started on it, then went to ID. Going back is probably easy. Going there with an ID mindset will be maddening, I think.

And I agree, wearing a tie is harder than either.

That closes the window you were working in, not the program itself! In most cases, you could have several windows per program open. Difference between a Mac and a PC. PC's have windows nested inside other windows, while Mac OS tends not to.</div>

i know how you feel - i find elaborate reasons to doubt my best offers, and generally i'll stick with a comfort zone in software and find experts to work in platforms i haven't had time to explore. 

but two things: i'm always upfront with new and potential employers about what i DON'T know, and if we're serious about each other they're usually glad to provide time or training. the biggest obstacle for me is time (and the cost of my free time to train), and if they're willing to pay you to come on board AND learn some new chops, i'd say this offer is a gift !</div>

		<div class="commentbody">From my perspective, it's all the same really. You'll get the same results. I started on OS 9 using Quark, bought a Powerbook and taught myself InDesign, built a PC so I could work on the Quark files at home (my newspaper got rid of their PCs, so yay for me, a free Quark license!)

I was used to my nice Powerbook and Creative Suite workflow when I took a job at a newspaper that used OS 9 and Pagemaker 5. Talk about a step backwards.

And how did things turn out differently? Nothing changed. You place some photos, you wrap some text around it, you hit print. 

What a person uses for their <em>personal</em> machine, however, is completely subjective.

I always wondered why, in Windows, you had to go to a menu called "Start" to shut down the machine.  ;-P

But seriously... The red close button wasn't always there... And I wasn't very happy when Mac adopted the traffic light buttons... What do they have to do with the old desktop metaphor? But I'm used to them now.</div>

Ya know, I never questioned that, but you raise a good point.

I remember I never questioned the English language until I tried teaching it to Vietnamese refugees at Camp Pendleton back in the early '70s. But I had to admit it is pretty screwy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is enough of Mac vs PC here to help you make your decision - but I think you need time to decide on other matters.
With which company will you feel you have job security? Which company has room for growth, promotion, salary increases, benefits, understanding of time off for family emergenicies?

Meanwhile, always before considering a job, find out from the company who had the job before you. Why do they no longer have it? Did they move up the ladder? Did they leave cursing up a storm? How long did they have the job - how many people have had this position?

Always check out if the employees of a company you are considering are happy working there and are well treated.

Then make the decision that is best for you and your future. 

Good luck.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although I'm pretty much the biggest mac fanboy there is, I wouldn't pass up a 30% raise at a great firm just to have to work on a pc. The quark thing may be the downside for me. I don't understand why anyone still uses it, especially with the new creative suites. I feel like quark impedes my process so much that the result is lower quality work. I'd personally say go for it though, and hope that quark waves the white flag before cs4 comes out in a year or so.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I use Quark 6 on a mac, but use Indesign CS2 on a PC with newer versions on Illustrator and Photoshop so I have to switch between mac and pc all day.  I don't know PC's as well as macs but have to say I much prefer working on the mac, dragging whatever you want into the icons is so much handier than using menus to open stuff every time, along with everything else that's handier on a mac, but I am new to PC's so I may have some more to learn there. Quark 7 is close enough to indesign if they have that, don't know if it's selling well mind you, I could count the quark 7 files I received so far on one hand, PDF's produced are OK but still not as good or as small as those from indesign...you shouldn't have too much trouble with quark if you know indesign but you will have more work to do, especially on a PC, which are a lot cheaper than macs, but I have to say they feel a lot cheaper too....take the job and if it doesn't work out I'm sure you'll find another one anyway.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Please excuse this outburst, but since switching to Mac in late January, the thing that strikes me as completely blowing away PCs is the search function. The magnifying glass in the upper right corner searches not just file names, but inside .pdf and various text files files and Word docs, spreadsheets, e-mails, etc. (on all your drives) and gives you a definition from the dictionary as fast as you can type it in the search field. Stunning the first few times; still pretty amazing.</div>
