  same. While doing my kerning classes I found that could be cool to copy and paste
  the classes for, for example f and F. Is there any way to accomplish this task without
  doing same task twice?\r\n\r\nThanks dudes!"

  body: "You\u2019re missing my point. You don\u2019t need to make a copy of the class
    if the letters are identical. Just put the second letter into the class you\u2019ve
    already created for the first letter. This saves you from creating the second
    batch of classes entirely."

  body: "Michael, whole the point of having kerning classes in the first place is
    to group similar shapes together\u2014that's what kerning classes are. In the
    classes panel in Fontlab, you'd make a class called '_kernF' or whatever, and
    you'd add all f-like shapes into that group. Just make sure you remember which
    glyph is the key glyph, or you'll get messed up kerning in your output file. What
    exactly are you asking?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kerning-Classes_5376.gif]"
