  its hand written, i know... But maybe someone can help me out with a very similar
  font (or just its name).\r\nThe letter S (like in Semicanals), f (like in surface),
  T (like in Tensor) are the most important for me.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your
  time!\r\nboondie"

  body: "This is a modern typeface. (modern as in style, like oldstyle, didone, etc.)\r\nMostly
    used in the late 19th and early (i.e. first half) of the 20th century. I would
    not be surprised, if your book was from this time.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly (or not
    so much if one considers the effect of cultural cycles) little of them have been
    digitalised.\r\n\r\nYou might want to checkout the \"Old Standard\" typeface by
    Alexey Kryukov\r\n     http://www.thessalonica.org.ru/en/fonts.html\r\nwhich is
    a very nice rendering of that style! (Digitalised original print).\r\n\r\nbtw.
    I would not call the above example expanded. It's the optical size that makes
    it look expanded, I guess. Which size is that annotation in in the original? 6pt?\r\n(Alexey's
    digitalisation is base on something like 10pt originals).\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"

  body: I meant Century Expanded, as opposed to Century Schoolbook or Century Old
    Style for example.

  body: "I remember Gray mentioning somewhere where the plates originally come from,
    but I can't find it right now though. Actualy, that may have been a different
    anatomy textbook.\r\n\r\nBut I can scan this figure in higher resolution if that
    would help."
