  May well be proprietary \u2013 it's meant to evoke the kind of folksy blackletter-esque
  lettering that's found in [[http://www.nordiskamuseet.se/sites/default/files/styles/adaptive/public/public/amnen/mobler-boende/dalmalning_0198927.jpg?itok=aNthJBGR|traditional
  rural painting in Sweden]] (almost rotunda-like, except on the other extreme of
  Europe) , and I'm not sure whether that's a commercially viable style. But on the
  off-chance it's available, anyone have any leads?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pepparkaksdeg_3832.jpg]"

  body: "Good find on the Linotype Dala \u2013 clearly another font with a similar
    background, inspired by the Dala painting tradition I linked to in the first post.
    But I do think this <em>is</em> type \u2013 because of the similar repeating letters,
    the layer-based drop shadow and the otherwise completely contemporary packaging:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_0051_4129.jpg]\r\n\r\nNote
    a more conventional fraktur in the \"god jul\" (Merry christmas) vectory faux-seal.
    Maybe more products will appear closer to the holiday season?"

  body: I went ahead and emailed Fazer, the manufacturer, and they told me it was
    custom type by Hans Samuelson of <a href="http://www.samuelstype.com/">Samuelstype</a>.
    I've emailed Hans and asked for more details, let's see what more we can learn.

  body: Ah, just got the reply right now from Hans. :) It actually is Bo Berndahls
    "Dala" as suggested by kthompson5! Heavily customised in Illustrator. I think
    it's lovely, wish it was an actual typeface. :)

  body: "Edited:\r\nThis round-script Fraktur lettering looks warm and inviting compared
    to the choppy forms of standard Fraktur. \r\nInteresting options for uppercase
    letters include the flowing letterforms of some of the letters in OPTI's Modern
    Blackletter [img:sites/default/files/old-images/OPTIModernBlackletterAsSTOW_5840.jpg]\r\nI
    suspect that this is one of the relatively few fonts that OPTI independently digitized.
    OPTI is a defunct operation and its fonts are now orphans. Deiter Steffmann pirated
    the font and called it Fraktur Moderne.\r\nLook closely at the lowercase and you
    will see that behind the flowing curves of the script are the broken stroke letter-forms
    of the classic Frakturs such as\r\nWittenberger Fraktur\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/Wittenberger+Fraktur/fonts/\r\nNeue
