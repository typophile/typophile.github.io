  sample they could get for me. Tiny and faxed.\r\n\r\nIt looks familiar, like I've
  seen it here recently, but I can't find it now."

  body: "That's a pretty tough sample to ID anything from. Did you try looking through
    either Part 6 or Part 11 of the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html|Script
    Font ID Guide]]? You might be able to find something that would be close enough
    that your client couldn't tell the difference, if that's the only sample they
    have. The ones in Part 6 should be more professional looking lettering than the
    Part 11 samples.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
