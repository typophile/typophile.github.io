  body: one comment. the hyper-extended bars on the T make it hard to "read" as a
    T. At first i kept thinking it said "Naglilech." I think it's very important that
    there be no confusion about what the name of the company is with its logo.

  body: Erica, work on the kerning its very inconsistant the gap between T and e in
    Tech is so large you could drive a truck through it. I suggest you try a version
    where you separate the mark from the type (two elements) when you combine them
    it makes the "logo", "art" not very business like. Your choices in typefaces are
    interesting not boring.

  body: Erica, please in future posts make the samples smaller. Make the orange and
    green sprials less important than the the type (tint of a solid color)

    a critique, we need to know some context. What are the logos for? What does the
    company do? What are the project paramaters? What's your concept? hat are the
    reasons for using the type/elements that you are using?\r\n\r\n"
