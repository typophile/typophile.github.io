body: 'Hey everyone, I recently have become serious about typography. I''ve always
  dabbled and kept up with foundries but just recently i''ve started to purchase some
  nicer fonts and over the last year have built quite a collection. Now i just throw
  all the fonts i get into my user/library/fonts and dont think about it again. Now
  my list is over populated and I would like to reorganize by foundry or font (ie:
  serif, sans, sript) i would like to know how you guys go about keeping your font
  list uncluttered. I downloaded fontxplorer X from linotype? not sure if this is
  the best tool or not, any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks for everything.
  Also is there a way to strip all additional fonts besides my original mac leopard
  system fonts, my list has become so unorganized!'
