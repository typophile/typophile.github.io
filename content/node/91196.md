  on gonna be hinted.\r\nlately I've been researching the technical parts, and think
  i quite got it well, \r\n\r\nbut my main questions are design perspective:\r\n1.
  Before designing the typeface, are there any limits I need to take in account? (White
  spaces? open glyphs?)\r\n2. What's the difference between the process of designing
  a typeface for print and for screen?\r\n3. how free-form can the glyph be? or should
  it be very mathematical?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nYennok."

  body: When designing for screen, it helps a lot if you have a target pixel-per-em
    (ppem) size or range of sizes in mind. This is especially true today, given the
    prevalence of asymmetric rendering, i.e. systems such as ClearType that apply
    different different grid resolutions in the x and y directions. If you can target
    a particular ppem size, you can design your glyphs so that their proportions naturally
    give the kind of onscreen shapes that you want at that size (generally providing
    positive results for adjacent sizes too). You will inevitably face the frustration
    of asymmetric rendering as the same outlines look less good as you move away from
    that target size before looking good again as they approach the next 'magic' size
    at which the proportions just work. [The only way to avoid this is to produce
    more than one design, targeting different ppem size ranges.]

  body: 'Much depends on what you mean by ''superhint''. If you mean something like
    heavily delta''d instructions controlling precisely the pixel appearance of the
    type at individual sizes, then I think it is obvious that the diversity of rendering
    methods now in play make this technically impossible, especially since some of
    these rendering methods ignore some or all of the hint instruction set most of
    the time. Beat Stamm has suggested what I think is a different kind of superhinting:
    programming in the TT instruction language that allows for dependent hints targeting
    different environments. Even in that case, though, I think the reality is that
    design for screen has to begin at the outline level, and isn''t something that
    can be applied post-facto in hinting as was the case for binary bitmap display.
    The days when Times New Roman could be turned into a credible screen reading font
    with hinting are long gone. The push to enhance individual typeface fidelity via
    antialiasing, to represent text type on screen recognisable as individual type
    designs rather than as highly readable but generic brick patterns, necessarily
    implies that the qualities that make for good screen readability must reside in
    the design. That was the genius of Verdana and Georgia and why they continue to
    work so well across so many different rendering technologies, and why that approach
    disitinguishes the best work being done in UI and webfont design.'
