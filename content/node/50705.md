body: "Have a client who signed off on a logotype set in PMN Caecilia. Now need to
  find a suitable companion typeface for text and taglines, and a web equivalent.
  \r\n\r\nThe client runs a large executive placement firm and like things 'clean
  & modern'.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: The most logical sans serif companion for Caecilia is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/thesans_basic/">TheSans</a>.
    Comes from the same school of thought.

  body: "I think that putting a member of the Thesis family and PMN Ceacilia in \u2018one
    bed\u2019 could be a bit indelicate. The designers came from the same school and
    the same influences, but PMN Caecilia is more coherent than TheSerif (formerly
    known as Thesis Serif). \r\n\r\nFor what it\u2019s worth: I have used Caecilia
    extensively for headlines as well as text (which I preferred slightly compressed,
    say to 92 or 94%), and have combined it with for instance Metro Sans (Bold) for
    captions and such, or with Avenir (that has some of that Neo-Humanist quality
    that Caecilia has too.\r\n\r\nPMS Caecilia is one of my all time favorites, as
    you might guess : )\r\n\r\nWeb equivalent? Not amongst the usual suspects, I am
    afraid.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

    Caecilia itself is perfectly suitable for book-length body text!

    that one's typos and inadvertent errors do not normally need to be pointed out,
    but in this case, the error seemed somewhat humorous, and I thought you and others
    might enjoy noting it. (I did try to convey my light-hearted intent with the use
    of the \"Smile\" word -- guess that didn't work, sorry.)\r\n\r\n-- Clint\r\n"

    in the humanist sans world could probably be made to accompany it well, too.
