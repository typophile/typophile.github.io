  there is no better source/picture for this information. The font in question is
  the one in blue , and it has nothing to do with the one in the top right corner.\r\n\r\nI
  think it's probably a commonly used font, Arial Narrow?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Arial comes to mind for sure (mainly because of /G right side flat section)
    but it lacks some many details it's really hard to be positive. Arial /M and /R
    don't look out of the scope either. [[http://www.identifont.com/identify?16+G+2DH+23+4KH+9M+773+F+20Z+97+1QN+J+9J+2BT+6X5+6XA+9Z|Identifont]]
    might provide some more leads to explore but to me, Arial (Narrow or horizontally
    stretched) should do the job.
