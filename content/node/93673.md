  all their branding was this (see attached)\r\n\r\nRecently seen something similar
  a few times and can't ID it.\r\nThe middle bar of the 'E' throws me with some of
  my initial guesses.\r\n\r\nInterstate?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nB.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ISTD-CfE-20111_5174.png]"
