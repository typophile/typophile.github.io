  body: "what is with the 'i' in Belgium?... weird. The '0' confirms Avant Garde Gothic.
    and it is bold\r\n\r\nwhat searching did you do before you posted, did you go
    to http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ \r\nor any other foundries, this is a easy
    font to recognise\r\n\r\nwhen I was a student I would endlessly try to find typefaces
    myself, the journey to identifying them was great, discovering other typefaces
    on the way"

  body: Michael Place [build - wearebuild.com] likes to customize his type so my guess
    is that this is the above mentioned Avant Garde Gothic with some custom works.

  body: "\"Avant Garde Roundotted, lol.\" LOL\r\n\r\nWow, this WhatTheFont is great!\r\n\r\nI
    started to think that maybe its a specific customization for this work. I don't
    know.. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the paralelism of A and V is so perfect! And the AvantGarde
    is not like this! Not in a large size. This made me remember again the 'specific
    customization'.\r\n\r\nBut nothing I couldn't do! Thanks for the help!!!"
