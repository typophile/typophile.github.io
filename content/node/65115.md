  strength lies mostly in illustration. I'm working on a wine label for a computer
  graphics class and I can't figure out what to use for the name. \r\n\r\nFeel free
  to critique the heck out of the design itself while your at it, I'm more than open
  to it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wine lable_3992.gif]"

    born Finn I don't get my home town feeling in the lable. The official city of
    Helsinki these days is all Helvetica, but there's also plenty of Jugend/Art Nouveu
    in the old buildings. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/freda_5916.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/14_5575.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/28_5016.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/paivakoti_3581.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/11_5446.gif]\r\n\r\nHere
    you can find some pictures from the city:\r\nhttp://taivasalla.net/english/\r\n\r\nThe
    global warming hasn't made it possible to grow grapes here just yet, so my guess
    is, that your wine is made of berries :)] "
