  body: You're probably not doing anything wrong; Dreamweaver has a lot of its own
    problems. To solve this one, in the CSS statement <strong>#logo {</strong>, switch
    the numbers for left and top...

  body: "indesign are not meant for web design, so try not to use it when possible.\r\n\r\nbasically
    the 'problem' with it is dreamweaver is their browser view sucks, it is inaccurate
    in most instances and extremely inaccurate in some cases. In your case I think
    dreamweaver just added some margin or padding (visually not literally) since you
    added &lt;div&gt;.\r\n\r\nif you are still in school learn to code by hand, It
    will save you time in the long run."

  body: "I am still in school and in 2 semesters I am planning to learn web programming.
    \r\n\r\nI see a lot of places people saying Indesign sucks for web, I don't understand
    that statement. Photoshop is so hard and annoying to design a layout in, why would
    it be better?\r\n\r\nI don't know about the margin and padding because I did try
    adding margin:0; and padding 0; . It didnt make a difference and I did try viewing
    it in firefox and it looks the same as in Dreamweaver's viewer. \r\n\r\nWhat should
    I do? I already designed a lot in Indesign and i wouldnt be able to design a layout
    in photoshop. \r\n\r\nI am not doing the actual code of the website, I may do
    the HTML and CSS but thats a big maybe. If i do it or don't do the code I still
    need to figure this out so I can tell the programmer where things are positioned. "

    about web programming now. That''s the only way for certain that you will be able
    to figure out what''s going on. It will make using a program like Dreamweaver
    easier too. '

  body: "<cite>I see a lot of places people saying Indesign sucks for web, I don't
    understand that statement.</cite>\r\n\r\nInDesign was not primarily (or even secondary)
    designed to create web pages with. It's primary function is <em>document design</em>,
    and the typical end-product would be a PDF.\r\n\r\nThe very inclusion of \"pixels\"
    as a measurement unit in InDesign CS5 made my skin crawl. Every other measurement
    unit in InDesign is an existing one, with real physical dimensions (which is kind
    of important for printing and stuff).\r\n\r\nIf you want to make web pages, use
    a web design program. Your other example, Photoshop, is not one either."

  body: "inDesign is great software for what it was designed for: print production
    page layout. \r\n\r\nWeb design, unlike print design, has no fixed canvas. Designing
    in print is dictating the visuals. Designing for the web is suggesting the visuals,
    but willing to allow for variations and variables, along with interactions, time,
    movement, etc.\r\n\r\nAs such, inDesign is simply the wrong tool for this.\r\n\r\nDreamWeaver
    is slightly better, but even then, it's not a great tool for doing the visual
    design. \r\n\r\nThe best tool is an understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JS work.
    Once you start learning that, you can jump into your tool of choice to make visuals
    as needed, adding them to the mix.\r\n\r\nIf you have no ambition to learn any
    of that, that's OK. But then realize you're not going to be the one building the
    web sites. You're going to want to team up with a skilled UI designer/developer
    who can work with you to get you what you want. "

  body: "Since this thread was kindly revived by a spambot, I might add that for anyone
    who's looking for a a web design program that works like InDesign, try Adobe Muse.\r\n\r\nIt's
    in its early days, but very usable. Features are being added regularly. Specifically
    designed for print designers who like the way InDesign works."
