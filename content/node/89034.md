body: "I came across this lovely last night, a headline from a 1984 issue of National
  Geographic.  I've done some digging online and haven't found anything, and I'll
  go through my specimen books when I get home, but it would be great if this mystery
  could be solved sooner than that? I'm currently using Adso for a restaurant project,
  but I'd love to use this instead.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scotland_6237.jpg]\r\n\r\n(There's
  a little distortion on the end of the word \"Glory,\" I took a photo of the page
  and it wasn't completely flat)\r\n\r\nThanks a ton!"

  body: "I'm still looking for this one.. I suspect part of my searching trouble might
    be terminology. The shop I work at has sort of a house style, which mostly involves
    lots of boxy sans-serifs and custom scripts, so I'm afraid I'm less versed in
    the specifics of more traditional type.\r\n\r\nIt was used as a headline in National
    Geographic from not too terribly long ago, it can't be that obscure... right?
    I hope?"
