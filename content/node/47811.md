body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nHave just found this site after a year and a half in design
  wilderness!\r\n\r\nAm about to start a company called Bedouin Travel, it's based
  in London and the main activities are: 1. Islamic Pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina
  in Saudi Arabia and 2. General tours and holidays off the beaten track in the Middle
  East (Syria, Jordan, and Oman amongst others).\r\n\r\nAm looking for a font that
  reflects the companies professionalism in a market full of amateurs, with a consistent
  and clean (i.e. not over fussy or elaborate) brand image. To make an similae with
  cars, when I started the project I was pitching the image level at around the Bentley/Aston
  Martin luxury level when that was not an accurate reflection of the product or the
  market I'm going for. Continuing the car similae, it's more around the Audi/Lexus/Saab/Volvo
  level of image. Reliable, well made, high quality but not necessarily ostentatious,
  lives up to expectations and comfortable.\r\n\r\nI have had a logo designed (see
  attached) which I do like because it hints at something of the east without necessarily
  being over-islamic because many of my customers won't be. I could change the font
  of the logo but would need a very good reason to do so. \r\n\r\nI've tried serif
  fonts (Palatino) not sure it works on web, and san-serif (Optimum - which I like
  but not sure it works for the brand and now Avenir - which I really like and is
  what I'm currently favoring but need reassurance on unless there is something much
  better)\r\n\r\nI need to have my stationery printed and want something that satisfies
  web, business cards and letterhead as I'd like it to be consistent.\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be gratefully received (ps. early draft of website is at www.bedouintravel.com)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSaqib\r\n\r\n"
