<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody> I think typophile should use Cookies for logging in, i'm a member of probably thirty or forty forums, and i can't remember all the passwords, allso this would save a little bit of time... <br> <br>Allso, the frames annoy me, as i can't bookmark a thread or send a link without some hassle... <br> <br>Appart f rom that, great forum! </div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody> It does use cookies! Once you've logged in, you should never have to again. To activate it, click "Login/Register", enter your username/password and click "Log In" to open your account settings. Scroll down to "Preferences" and check the box marked "Remember my username and password in a cookie." <br> <br>I agree, the frames are a hassle, but we haven't had much luck trying to strip them out. A new version of the BB software is coming out, and we're hoping that is one of the new features. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Svenni, <br> <br>I've been pleased with the forum setup since <br>I signed up for new posts to be emailed to me. <br>This way I can keep up with discussions without <br>even visiting the site unless I want to see an <br>embedded graphic or see an entire thread at once. <br> <br>I believe you can set this in your user prefs. <br> <br>Stephen </div>

<div class=commentbody> Jared: <br> <br>Since the subject of passwords has been brought up, I haven't been able to use my account since I first signed up for it many months ago. The password that I thought I used when the account was created doesn't work, and the system won't let me make a new account with the same name or e-mail address. I sent an e-mail shortly afterward, but any reply never made it to me. <br> <br>Can anything be done? I've been getting along without trouble by manually entering my name and e-mail address on my posts, but it would be nice to have access to all of the functionality of an account. <br> <br>Thanks! <br> <br>David (lost soul) Thometz ;) </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody> In both IE 5.1 and Netscape 4.7x on my Mac the discussion pages are almost always far, far too wide. I have to scroll right to read long lines of text that don't have any line breaks in them, and the limit on just how wide these pages can get seems to be infinite. In this PARTICULAR thread the page works fine - as if the frame it is in has a set pixel limit, but many other threads here don't seem to have any page/column width limit. Surely this can be fixed pretty simply by tweaking the templates. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Ouch. Where's the love here people? Heh. <br> <br>Martin, the issue you raise is true--there are no <br>set pixel dimensions. You'll notice it most <br>glaringly when someone posts a graphic that is <br>over, say 600px wide. <br> <br>Lastly, note how my post (and Stephen's) is nice <br>and narrow? That's because I manually add line <br>breaks. <br> <br>This forum is software out of a box, and <br>so it's not always beautiful. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Manual line breaks? <br> <br>Sheesh -- next you'll suggest that we all <br>should KERN our fonts...!

<div class=commentbody> Here is the love: <br> <br>I highly recommend manual line breaking. <br>I find it's a very comforting, zen experience <br>(like ironing, or that stick-in-the-sand thing). <br> <br>Stephen </div>

<div class=commentbody> Manual line-breaking is indeed a form of art. <br>But note this: it reaches true nirvana only <br>when one adapts the actual content to <br>create a pleasant block of text. <br> <br>Furthermore: a good paragraph is neither a <br>roller-coaster ride with huge gaps and juts, <br>nor is it a military tribunal with completely <br>straight sides; it is a pragmatic, human thing <br>that is neither frantic nor frigid. The Ancient <br>Greeks knew this; in comparison, the Romans <br>were juvenile. <br> <br>My maxim for the ASCII age is this: Write for the rag. <br> <br>But the reason I refuse to do it on Typophile is simple: the typing window uses the predictable, monospaced Courier, but the end-result uses a proportional font - this makes the creation of nice text blocks much too laborious. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> By the way, I think I owe Jared an apology. <br> <br>On re-reading my previous post, it could be construed that I was complaining about a lack of assistance with my account and password. In truth, I sent only one e-mail regarding the problem, several months ago, and it was a secondary mention within a message about another topic. I didn't bother following up because I was getting along just fine on the boards entering my name and e-mail address manually with each post. <br> <br>It was only with the creation of this thread that I thought to ask about it again. As you can see, Jared fixed the problem for me immediately, for which I am grateful. <br> <br>My previous post was somewhat careless, and while Jared made no indication of taking offense, I wanted to clear the air anyway. <br> <br>Jared and Joe run a great organization, and I for one really appreciate their efforts. <br> <br>David (who once was lost, but now is found) Thometz <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> </div>
