  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The best gift I got for Christmas was a book about the design of the Norwegian telephone box (1933). So I got inspired, and drew some glyphs, and all of a sudden I had a whole alphabet. I didn't look at the telephone box lettering while I drew, I wanted to make letters resembling the Art Deco style there still were a lot of traces left of in Norway until the 80s (now, there's only a few phone boxes and some street signs left), without making a derivative of anything. 

I've made some deliberately naïve old-school choices, this is not a polished, modern take on a geometric sans serif. 

I have a bold (or rather an extra bold) weight half-drawn as well, and I think that's going to be the whole type family. I need to get something finished. All my former attempts have grown too large too soon, this is going to be my first finished project. But I need your help. Any kind of criticism is very, very welcome!

- The bottom half of the "s" is malformed.

You're definitely right about the "a", it looks like the afterthought it is. Originally I had a one storey-"a", but that is boring (and illegible, and makes the "æ" impossible). It didn't feel right, but I didn't know what I was looking for. Thanks for telling me. The Q is stolen from Jakob Erbar's sadly forgotten geometric (much used in the 30s up here), and you're right, it doesn't work. I'll think of something else. Those s-es are the most difficult glyphs I've <em>ever</em> drawn. The simplest shapes are the hardest. I'll try and fix it. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Cool project, and I'm right with you on feeling pressed to finish something a bit simpler.

In a way this is quite a difficult design to critique, since almost anything criticizable is equally likely an error or part of the deliberate naivete!

I definitely agree on the /a/.

I think sixes and nines may be *too* constructed looking, in their lack of tapering at the join and their sudden changeover from circle to line. Fours might need some more overshoot up top.

BDPR also have too hard of a break from straight to round on the outside contours.

Did you consider a counter on the R that was open at the bottom? That'd be another place where that acute angle could show up.

Did you consider a chevron-style structure for /K/ (and, I suppose, for /k/)? That might go with the /M/ well.

The diagonal of /N/ looks thin to me.

I wonder if the /G/ is a stylistic misfit in the way the /a/ is. Did you try any versions with crossbars? Euro also feels rather out of place.

That sliced off /t/ seems awfully arbitrary in a font where every other terminal hews to horizontal or vertical. Reminds me of Arial, too. :-( 

The spacing seems way too tight in the text setting, given the boldness, lack of contrast, and small x-height. I'm sure you haven't done much work with spacing at this stage, but I think it would be good to be able to determine fairly soon how legitimate the hopes of making this a font for running text are - and to judge that it needs some breathing room. 

This reminds me not only of Neutraface but even more of Tempo. [[http://typophile.com/node/10490|Here's]] one of several interesting Typophile threads on the latter.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you, everyone! 

Nina, the narrow "D" was a subconscious decision, I think. I've widened it slightly, just for you. (Er, and because it looks better.) Thanks for good-mouthing the "a". I like it too. It gives the lower case a much stronger identity, I think. Now the "g" and "a" are better friends, too. 

Craig, I've subtly softened "69", and made the "4" even taller. Darn, I love drawing spiky glyphs! And I've fought with the BDPR curves quite a bit. These shapes are always difficult for me, too tight, they get an undesirable diamond shape with ugly transitions from the lines, too soft, they look squarish. But I've finally learnt too use points at approximately 45 degrees in addition to extrema points, and that makes the transitions from the lines better, at least. Any better now?

Chevron kays I've tried twice, just can't make them work. Perhaps I'll try again. 

I've strengthened the "N" diagonal slightly, and widened the letter half a hair. But this is one of the letters I really want a little "wrong". 

Gee, I didn't know Tempo once was a proper typeface, I only knew those nondescript condensed bolds Adobe sell. Thanks for bringing it to my attention, it's great! I think Neutraface is but a parody, by the way. Some may say the same thing about my typeface. Well, at least it's parody that I <em>like</em>.

The "G", yes, that's a misfit. But I really like it. Georg Fredrik Fasting, the architect of the Norwegian telephone box, drew "G"s like that. On an ideological level, there's no other remnant* of the pen in this typeface, why use one here? But of course, it looks weird. I've thought a lot about it, too. 

* Except for the slanted "t" top. That's an influence from the old Norwegian street signs, and I just dig it. It should remind you of Erbar, not Arial.

Curves are difficult, and the simpler the shape, the more difficult they are. New BPRD here. And Craig, here's your conventional "G", too. And a wider N. There's now also quite a bit of optical tweaking in most of the glyphs shown here.

About your "R" suggestion: I actually tried this twice early in the process, and while I dig this shape, it reminds me very much of (the original) AvantGarde and Herb Lubalin and the 70s, and I discarded it because it felt out of place. Did that R shape exist earlier? I'd love to see an example of that. 

Jonathan, you're right about that, but you see, I don't want to make another Futura. I want this to be quirky. The letters that started it were TELEFON (see photograph in the specimen). Maybe I'll make more conventional alternates later, but that'll have to wait. 

About the spacing: Perhaps this is a display typeface, I really don't know yet. But if it is, the spacing is quite OK now (though crude) now, isn't it?

... you should include that splendid O, with the three stencil splits, as an alternate glyph. Maybe even create a stenciled version of the typeface and name it Telefon Kiosk / Kiosker / Kiosken.

I've done some more work on the "R", here are three candidates. The first one is wider, as per Frode's suggestion, the middle one is a slightly reworked version of the old one, the third one is an interpretation of Craig's suggested R (it took me quite a while to understand that shape, thanks for helping enlighten me), which I think probably is my favourite at the moment. What do you think?

Strange how defining the upper case R is! These three settings makes the word look like set in different typefaces, almost.  

I've no idea what the typeface of that Vogue cover is (I almost thought it was a mock-up, by the way, as all the headlines are so stereotypically women's magazine that it is laughable. "Love, sex and what to wear", isn't that the essence of all women's magazine headlines?). This is a very good illustration of what Jan Tschichold called "a thicket of letters", by the way. Thanks for scanning and uploading. 

I've been wondering about the crossbar "G" (I now think that one has to be the definite version ...), is the crossbar's length and height right? Is it a problem that it is only slightly higher than the "E" and "F" crossbar? Should I raise and/or lengthen it? (Am I getting type blind already?) 

Thanks, Frode, and so do I. Type and craft beer are amongst the nicest of man's inventions, and they should indeed be combined. 

Jonathan, that is a splendid idea, in fact, I thought of it when I started drawing, and then forgot. I'll go for a full stencil font instead of alternate glyphs, I think, but, as you suggest, only make cuts in the letters that needs them to stay together. This is going to be fun!   </div>

Crossbar of G: to me it looks a smidge too low, like it's trying to be the same as EFH but realised it can't quite get there.

I'd be careful not to lose the dimensional quirks through iteration.
<em>S</em> is a bit depressed at the base IMHO and the outlines seem shaky compared to the otherwise smooth alphabet.
I keep rotating S as I am drawing, otherwise I tend to run out of space constructing the lower curve.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you for all your comments and suggestions! I haven't had time for type drawing this weekend, so I'll just comment now and upload images and stuff later. 

Thanks for your kind words, Ben. You're probably right about the "D". It needs to be narrow, I think, but a few more units of width and some more meat in the curves will make it right. Your comment on the "G" confirms my own concerns about that glyph. Consider "2" and "5" fixed.

Thanks, Elias, and no, it's not just you, the middle bars of E and especially F are too long, but I think they really have to be. Their eccentricity sort of defines the whole typeface. Then again, someone good once said "kill your favourite glyph" or something like that. I'll have to think about it. 

Thanks for your advice, Randy. I've decided on the "R" now, and your spacing words will come in handy.    

Andrew, the corners are both filled and filed, and my method is quite straightforward. For this typeface, I made 10x10 bevels, and then I convert the sharp points to curved ones. I probably could use some script, but I prefer doing it by hand. Quite a lot of work (and lots of copy and paste), but that's okay with me. I like fiddling. 

You're right about the "S", it will be fixed. And thanks for your "S"-making advice.</div>

/v/ looks both light and insufficiently overshot on the baseline to me.

Tell me what's guiding your extender length decisions. I'm surprised you're pulling up the descenders with such (appealingly) high ascenders. 

I especially like the /n/, the /i/, the /f/, and the /z/. That question mark strikes me as too close to Futura (Telefon's got its own quirks, it doesn't need to copy Renner's!).

The /y/ feels like it's falling rightward, and the intersection seems high relative to the baseline to my eyes. Perhaps just shifting the long stroke's bottom points rightward while retaining the angle of the short stroke would solve both issues.

I wonder if all of your vertical strokes should be thinned the tiniest bit. Looking at "squaw," the /q/'s stem seems darker than the rest; and the vertical-dominated "litt" is the darkest word of all. (Some of this could be rasterization...)</div>

I went through your posts, and 'a' does need some work still (you decided to go with two-storey after all [heh]), and '?' is pretty lopsided. The stresses seem to be going the wrong way. Also some of the smooth corners on counters seem softer than outside, like in 'A'. That seems odd to me. Try to keep them is scale. And 'S' and 's' have bumps.

		<div class="commentbody">Craig, you're right about the vertical weight. I've now sliced a little off each stem, both cases, and I think that procedure have made for a better overall balance. I shortened the descenders because of that blasted "g", I couldn't make it deep enough without making a too large aperture. But perhaps it works now, the descenders are at their original depth again. I've tried to repair the "y", and I've fattened and tweaked the "v" a bit. 

Frode, what kind of "a" would you prefer? I'm going to have a one-storey one as one of few alternate characters. Personally, I dig the current "a". You were right about the "c", I've fixed it.  

Tomi, those S-es are difficult. I'm a beginner at vector drawing, you see (hadn't drawn a serious Bezier curve till october 2008), and I honestly can't see those bumps, but I've tried to make the curves as smooth as I can now. Is it better? I would be grateful if you could point out the faults, if they're still there. 

New question mark. This is still unpolished, do you think this shape could work?

I've done a lot of work on spacing and diacritics, and needed to do something else this evening. So I started drawing fat glyphs, something I've never done before. This is a very quick draft of an extra bold or black weight for Telefon. Is this approach right? Or does it look like a parody of Benton's Eagle? How do I solve the "G"? Is the tittle way, way too big?

I think the minuscule letters with round counters get too dark /b/d/g/o/p/q/. /O/ and /Q/ also might need bigger counters.
That /c/ is narrow but I'm not sure if/how to correct it.
Pretty nice job getting those vertically dense glyphs to work in such a heavy weight, /a/ and /s/ especially.
I think the tittles are fine.
/G/ is tough but you might be close already with what you have (I like it better than the Eagle solution, anyway).</div>

I'm just passing by and off to bed, but can't help noting a few spontaneous impressions:
- Agree that curvy caps need more white. 
- Tail on bold "Q" seems shy. I'd at least make it longer.
- Not sure about the terminals/counters on the bold "s", but I don't have an alternate idea either (helpful eh!).
- I *love* the "f"!

BTW, Eagle's "G" has gotten protests from all the clients I proposed the font to. It's too much like a "C". Your form seems a much better solution, although it seems a bit imbalanced to my eye (but maybe it's mostly the weight right now).</div>

I was very uncertain about this, I've never drawn such weighty glyphs (not entirely true, I drew a rudimentary bold for the other sans I'm working on, but that's a grotesque, which is much easier), and it's been a steep (and darn fast) learning curve. Encouraging words means a lot. Thanks a lot, Craig and Nina.

Yes, that "s" is a bit awkward, it has to carry a lot of weight, and I found that the 45 degrees cut of the medium weight was impossible. So I made it 22.5 (echoed in the unpopular slanted "t" top. Perhaps I should try 30 degrees. </div>

That's great advice, Craig! Thanks a lot. I've already done some (failed) experiments in that direction, and will continue to do so. Tomorrow. </div>

These latest numerals look splendid. Something about the zero is especialy juicy. I love the pointy junctions on 7 and 4, and though the counter of the 4 makes me wonder, I think it's a valid solution. I would like the diagonal to have more weight, but I also would like it to retain those points — if you moved the counter down slightly, could the arm have some weight taken off the top? You know, also I think the weight of the stem at the bottom could be reduced without drawing attention. Your 1 is delicious.</div>

Comma is a lot smaller than quotes, why?
£ looks light? It might not need to be the exact same weight as L, but it could be closer.
(I think I'm a bit obsessive about the £ sign however.)
Did I miss the section sign?
3 looks heavier on the bottom than on top. 
Grave and acute look a bit too centred, I can't remember the recommended ratio of what goes where above the centre line but the small end should be nearer the centre.

All in all, this is looking terrific. Great work Sindre.</div>

Bendy's right about the accent placement.
@ looks cramped in its circle.
percent and perthousand look quite roomy compared to everything else.
I love the question and exclamation and quotation marks.
Yen's top bar runs into the Y's arms a bit too much - could you lower the bars a bit to let some space in there?
Dollar looks like it leans right a touch.
/X/ may be a bit dark.
/M/ looks a little wide but I'm not sure if that's solvable while preserving the structure. /W/ too?
Great /R/!
Weight on /3/'s bowl strokes isn't as even as it should be - looks like it gets cartoonishly fat at the southeast.

I agree on all your suggestions, and have tried my best to follow them. Does this look better to you? I've fixed the per cent/thousand and the comma issue too, and I will look into the dollar problem later. Have to do some other work first. (I'm deeply envious of the people who actually make typefaces for a living.) I forgot about the section mark, and I see now that its curves are a bit wobbly. But do you think its basic shape and weight works?

I think the accents (acute and grave) still look way off. I would put the bottom of them very near the optical centerline of the letters.
I'm afraid /3/ still looks a bit fatassed to me. :-/

W looks a bit precariously balanced; I might try spreading out the lower vertices. 
J could be a little wider maybe?
Nice job cramming that S in (though those counters have a touch of that squinting, too, maybe).

With the counterspaces so thin, they may start to read as lines (a la [[http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/klimax/plus/character_set?size=72&feature=|Klimax]]) rather than counter<em>shapes</em>: I do like how /H/ and /U/ don't reduce the counters to lines. 
That said, there's not a lot of vertical room to work with in a "morbidly obese" /E/. 
Maybe optimum size for the font is something you should think about as you make that decision.
It also occurs to me that if you thickened E's counters and they wound up more or less matching the letterspacing when followed by a straight (as in the EF of your sample), they actually might look <em>more</em> like lines rather than shapes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, well done with that S! I agree with Craig about the G, and I'll be intrigued to see if there's another solution to the C. Next to D, the first C's counterspace looks very different.
I think F crossbar could even go a bit thinned. 
Lower leg of K looks a bit tight. R is lovely though.
I wonder if the arms of T need to be heavier to compensate for the gaps underneath (I'm conjecturing that at extreme weights like this it can be more about minimising the white space consistently than having the black strokes all the same weight. At least it'd be interesting to work that way and see what happens.)
I think there may be some kind of optical illusion caused by the tail of the Q that makes its counter look too far left.
N may need more overshoot?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sindre, that's a tough one! I think the counter of C needs to be somehow more central in the glyph, to make the weight more equal all around the curve. I had a quick try which might be a starting point:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Telefon-C_5338.gif]
I made the counter a bit more circular too.

5 looks too skinny—could you make the bottom come around like /S/'s? 7 could stand to be a touch wider too.
If you could fatten 3's upper stroke that might be good. (Hey, deja vu! :-) )
The contrast in zero may be a bit much—did you try it with the counter squooshed in from the sides a little more?

I don't see a big problem with your /G/. The /C/ just looks too fat on the left. What happens if you just bring in that left extremum a bit?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First off - this is really impressive! I love this typeface already.

For some ideas on the "æ-ae" solution you can (obviously) check Futura, but also PTL Superla.  I think the latter alternative is the way to go, since it will preserve the geometric feel to it (even though Futura goes the other way).

I just noticed this thread so I have to get back to you with more input. The numbers are delicious, especially No5, and the letter "M" is stunning.

IMHO the morbidly obese weight is just.. morbid. Didn't like it at all. The typeface lost its qualities there.</div>

I've been having second and third thoughts about that overweight cut too, while I like some of the glyphs (BHMNRS and perhaps WZ), others are plain awful or cartoonish. Perhaps it's a good idea to finish the other three weights (after all, the ultra caps are still but an experiment), and then try a rethought fat face, perhaps less ultrablack, perhaps slightly condensed. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is really terrific work. 
Attractive letters and they fit together nicely (favorite combos include /ra/, /fi/, /tt/). That Arial-slant /t/ even slopes up nicely to an ensuing /h/! ;-) The letterspacing in the regular weight text sample looks tight to me.

I still think /J/ could be wider in all weights.

Looking at it in the text settings, I think the bowl of /a/ should be a hair smaller in the regular weight.

In the bold weight, the /Q/ looks heavy at the bottom - should you push that counter down the slightest bit?
Also in bold, I think the upright segment of /5/ could be heavier by a touch.

In the black weight, the diagonal of /7/ may taper too much - the cartoonish effect threatens to arise.

I like the idea of the narrow /z/, but I think it could gain a little in width more with every jump bolder.

The sterling doesn't do it for me. Did you or could you experiment with a bottom that turns acute at the left, like your /2/?

I buy the "stemless" cedilla solution in the black weight but maybe not in the bold and not at all in the regular.

(Note: the glyphs page for the black weight is mistakenly labeled "TELEFON BOLD.")

Again, great work. Get this on the market and hopefully soon you'll have funded your trip to America to bring me beer.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks again for your time and thoughts, Craig. I was starting to feel a little insecure about this whole project, your criticism blew away those cloudy thoughts. 

Yes, I've had doubts about the spacing. I guess I've landed on a spacing suitable for display work. But perhaps I should make it looser, so it can be set at ten or twelve points without the need for manual adjustment. But I wonder how much that will affect the kerning. I'll do some experiments. Is it only the regular that's too loose, do you think? 

I'll more or less blindly follow your other suggestions, perhaps except for the cedilla thing. I think it works in all weights, but I might be blinded by my own idea. It would be great to have second on third opinions on this. (I kind of like my sterling too, but that glyph is rather alien to me, so I guess I'll follow your advice.)

		<div class="commentbody">Ok well I had a sneaky look at this earlier and the £ didn't draw attention to itself, in fact everything looked unbelievably polished and beautiful. I really like this one. 

Well I'm going to look through in super-picky mode so take my comments with even more salt than usual...

a is terrific! I love the egg shaped counter. As Craig said, perhaps it could be narrower but only a hair, it's great.

Tilde looks funny. I think it should be more monoline and more geometric somehow, like two semicircles with horizontal terminals??

aacute seems to need the acute moving left a bit, as the hood is already quite rightward.

aogonek: I think I'd slim the bottom spur slightly to compensate for the extra weight below the baseline.

ccedilla: I think the cedilla works fine, though could do with a final polish (the counter looks vaguely deformed)

eth looks a different size completely.

eogonek is beautiful.

I love f.

g may need a tiny bit shaving off the tail's terminal. It looks a bit getting fatter at the end.

ezh needs a polish on the lower curve. The rightmost nodes may need sliding down.

nacute needs the acute further to the right.

Why is there a smallcap R in the lowercase?

s is incredible. Good work.

scedilla may need cedilla further right.

w is awesome.

Wow, a wynn! Why not indeed.

yacute: move the acute right. And the opposite for ygrave.


Fractions: I think I'd add a hair more weight overall.

£: Now, here's the difficult one! I love the quirky toppling shape of this. I'd pull the straight section of the stem up a bit to make the left side of the hood more taut and geometrical. But actually what I'd like to see is a vertical terminal on the hood and a slab on the right end of the foot. And if you can make the hood's terminal hover over the slabbed foot then it would echo the G. I think a pointy 2-like £ would look out of place in this font.

Percent looks light.

@ might benefit from more space between the a and the ring.

Your punctuation rocks!!

TM: more weight?

Section is such a hard one. It looks wide maybe?

Uppercase:

Ccedilla: should the cedilla be a slight bit heavier than on the lc?

D: perhaps the bcps need pulling a few units right on the top and bottom of the bowl?

E with diacritics: the diacritics seem to be all slightly too far left.

Eogonek needs to have the ogonek flush with the right end of E's foot.

Ezh may be too narrow. I'm quite unfamiliar with it really though.

Q may need its right side lifting ever so slightly to even out the density above its tail.

What is that funny R thing?

Scedilla: see scedilla.

OE: I've never seen one like that, but I really like it. Is that ok?

I haven't looked in such depth through the bold and black. See what happens with the regular first!

Really liking this, there's something really 1930s about this style to me, but much sharper. </div>

Yes, that small cap R may seem odd, but it's really a lower case Yr, used for scholarly transcription of Proto-Norse. (The upper case Yr is that weird R with the right part moved a storey down.) Yes, I know nobody will ever use it for this (nor for Livonian), but <em>I</em> want to be able to set "Ek HlewagastiR HoltijaR horna tawido" properly.

I had no intention of including ezh, as that is only used by the moribund Skolt Sami. (And transcription of some African languages, but I <em>definitely</em> won't support any of those.) But then again, now I'm just a few glyphs away from Skolt Sami. Here we go again ...  </div>

About the superiors: All hinting so far is auto-generated, I have to read up on hinting before I do anything. But perhaps their design is flawed too, I haven't paid much attention to those little guys. By the way, I've made slightly fatter fractions (and superiors):

I very much like your new £. I personally love the one with the slab, because the other looks a little too simple and naked against the more complex forms of the other currency signs...but of course it would occur with numerals which are very simple shapes. In terms of harmonising then, the slabless one proabably wins.</div>
