  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We are casting our nets far and wide for an <strong>Art Director</strong> to join us.

We are looking for someone with more than five years professional experience working as both as a thought leader and a supporting teammate. You are dedicated to honing your skills and playing to your strengths. Good things don’t just come to you, you earn them. And people take notice. Your portfolio reflects conceptual development, strategic thinking, typographic sensitivity and visual pacing. You are comfortable working across print and digital, and everything in-between, and understand working with strong established brands. You have the client’s best interests at heart and are dedicated to making them successful. 

You thrive in a strong collaborative environment, and understand when to lead, when to follow, when to champion your own ideas, and when to champion others’. You are a creative leader and you understand how to educate and partner with our clients, how to make your teammates around you better, and to look for mentoring opportunities to grow and improve the team.


<strong>Visionaries. Role Models. Educators. Teammates.</strong>

Five words that tell you about opus:creative, our philosophy, the people that work here and our approach to the relationships we have with our clients.

We've been recognized by Oregon Business Magazine for the last four years as one of the best small companies to work for in Oregon. We heartily agree. 

Please send portfolio, résumé, and a short essay that tells us why you are our next art director to:  careers@opuscreative.com (please direct your email to Jason Sherwood in the subject line)

Seriously though, a thought leader is someone doesn't need or want everything spelled out for them. Someone who can lead our clients through strategic innovation. Someone our clients trust and rely on for guidance.

As for the essay, we didn't feel like a word count was necessary.

There are two ways of answering the "best small companies" question The quantitative answer can be found here:

For me though, it is something more emotional. I love what I do. I love who I work with.

Thanks and good luck to you as well.
