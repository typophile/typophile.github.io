  throughout the years and since the scans I found are rather dodgy I'm in need of
  a helping hand.\r\n\r\nFrom 1951 to beginning of 1961. An italic typeface with characteristics
  from Gill Sans and Futura. All-caps.\r\nhttp://www.iskelma.fi/files/content_800/2011_12_05_4edc748ad9ded.jpg\r\n\r\nEarly
  1960\xB4s:\r\nUpparcase/lowercase style introduced, some resemblence to Futura again.\r\nhttp://www.antikvariaattimakedonia.fi/moog//Images/manual/Aku%20Ankka%201965%2039%20s14%20002.jpg\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!\r\n\r\nVille"

    designed for Linotype.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Now, I'm not so sure, since the J going below
    the line in the all-caps italic sample does not seem to be characteristic of Metro,
    even though that face still does look similar."

    I'm after here. Will examine further and get back with the findings!"
