    buy it. Yoost did a great job with it and you Yoost can&#39;t ignore  <BR>that
    Yoost&#39;s lefthand is better than his right. <BR> <BR>Seriously, handwriting
    fonts are way in &#40;scripts are too, but less  <BR>so&#41; and Just Lefthand
    is an excellent choice. It&#39;s got enough flare  <BR>to give it some polish,
    but is convincingly spontaneous because <BR>it is not too decorative or ornate.'

  body: This is a bit off-topic, but Joe said <i>&#34;Seriously, handwriting fonts
    are way in&#34;</i> and I just noticed yesterday that Phil&#39;s Fonts has started
    selling a CD of 300 Handwriting fonts for $289 from The Type Marketing Co. Turns
    out that these are not new handwritten fonts at all &#40;I wrote to Phil&#39;s
    pointing this out, because I want to believe they didn&#39;t know this&#41;, but
    the same ones that WSI took and re-named from the 1995 ClickArt Handwritten Fonts
    CD. These fonts are scattered all over the web, all using names with the form
    <i>Somebodys</i> Hand. These fonts have had a way of showing up over and over
    again, because they have that sort of anonymous look, but I have the original
    ClickArt CD, which I got in return for giving permission to include my printing
    as one of the 300 fonts &#40;called &#39;Bowfin&#39; in the original, but renamed
    &#39;Marions Hand&#39; by WSI&#41;. <BR> <BR>ClickArt &#40;actually T/Maker Co.&#41;
    no longer exists as a separate entity, having been taken over by Broderbund, which
    in turn became part of The Learning Company, but I have never heard that Weatherly
    Systems Inc &#40;WSI&#41; had the rights to those fonts. The fact that they stopped
    selling them directly years ago reinforces that idea, but these fonts with their
    everyday anonymity have taken on a life of their own through third parties , like
    Expert Software and the Type Marketing Company who have repackaged and sold the
    same collection. <BR> <BR>I plan to keep blowing the whistle about this until
    it stops or gets cleared up.  <BR> <BR>Ok, I&#39;ll get off my soapbox now. Thanks
    for bearing with me.
