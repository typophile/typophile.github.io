  body: With the slight difference between the three Es I think it is hand lettered,
    copying a simple signwriters grid-based gothic appropriate to the era.

  body: Actually the slight differences stem from my resizing of the lettershapes
    in the poster, which have a slight gradient overlayed. I do believe that this
    really is a font and not hand-lettered type.

  body: "I just went to check out the official Public Enemies website hoping to find
    a press kit with the embedded font, but I did not get lucky. So instead I noticed
    that the preloader seemed to use the same typeface, so I took a peek inside the
    swf file and it uses Compacta, which is similar but not identical. Its M touches
    the baseline, the middle of the S is not straight but diagonal and the height-width
    relation does not quite match up either. But it's close.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/compacta/]]"
