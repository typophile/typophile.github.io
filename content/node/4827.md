  (9 k)</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-/Attachment-!> <BR>I began designing Xozza 6
  months ago. I wasn&#39;t  <BR>inspired by any existing face in particular, but i
  guess there must be some similar fonts out there. I saw a similar one at <A HREF="http://www.thirstype.com/index.html">thirstype</A>
  <BR> <BR>This is my third digital type face, and i know it has some problems. But
  i like it very much and i have spent a lot of time in its design so i would like
  to finish it and get the best font i can. Any comments would be very much appreciated.
  i especially have doubts about numbers and some lc glyphs:k,i,j,t. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for any help or comments in advance.'

    doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t do your own thing. <BR> <BR>BTW, one small
    piece of advice: the more you like something, the harder it is to be objective
    about its flaws. When this thing is a typeface -something &#42;other&#42; people
    must like- this becomes a big issue. On a practical level, this means that you
    might consider putting it aside for a few weeks, then taking a fresh look at it.

  body: ' Quka, <BR> <BR>While some of the characters show some interesting promise
    &#40;particularly D, K, a, b, and x&#41;. However, most of the characters are
    awkward, as if they&#39;re forced into that curved shape, &#40;A, C, H, 7, etc.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Perhaps there&#39;s some way to preserve what&#39;s interesting about
    that shape without forcing the other characters into unnatural configurations.
    <BR> <BR>Good luck with it. <BR> <BR>//joe '
