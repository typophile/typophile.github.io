body: "I am happy to announce that St Bride Library and the Department of Typography,
  University of Reading are collaborating on a two-day conference on non-Latin typeface
  design. The conference will be on Tuesday 18 and Wednesday 19 September 2007, and
  will comprise a day of talks at St Bride Library, London, and a day of hands-on
  sessions at the Department of Typography, Reading.\r\n\r\nSpeakers at the conference
  at St Bride include Graham Shaw (Head of Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections at
  the British Library), Victor Gaultney, Mammoun Sakkal, and Maxim Zhukov, amongst
  others.\r\n\r\nThe hands-on day at Reading includes sessions working with original
  material from collections of both institutions. Sessions will be conducted by: Jo
  de Baerdemaeker, Dr Martin Dodds (Principal Examiner for Urdu, CIE), Gerry Leonidas,
  Thomas Milo, and Dr Fiona Ross. As sessions at Reading involve working with original
  artefacts, seats will be limited to 30 persons.\r\n\r\nThe twin events will be accompanied
  by substantial exhibitions on the theme of the conference from the collections of
  both institutions. A lot of this material has rarely been seen before, and certainly
  not in this concentrated manner. The gems include original drawings for several
  reference non-Latin typefaces. The exhibitions will be curated by Fiona Ross and
  Rathna Ramanathan. \r\n\r\nRegistration fees are \xA360 for the Tuesday only, and
  \xA3120 for both days; student fees are \xA340 and \xA380 respectively. \r\n\r\nOther
  speakers are in the process of being confirmed. We will post updates as soon as
  more information becomes available.\r\n\r\n\r\nRob Banham, Gerry Leonidas, Rathna
  Ramanathan, and Fiona Ross"
