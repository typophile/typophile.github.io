  alternatives like: Pump, Blippo, Moderna but I'm not satisfied with them. They look
  'outdated' to me. Not trendy (contemporay is a better word) enough. Important is
  the font has no spur or serif. It doesn't need to be complete round.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help.\r\n\r\nHS"

    Font (maybe a little to soft but a very nice font)\r\nhttp://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/co\r\n\r\n\r\nKaliber
    (a bit farther away from Bauhaus but a 'sturdy' type)\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/kaliber_regular/\r\n\r\nDistilla\r\nhttp://www.t26.com/fonts/Distilla\r\n\r\nBut
    more suggestions are stil welcome. Like a said before. It is important the font
    has no spur or serif. It doesn't need to be completly round like the Bauhaus but
    it musn't look to techno\r\n\r\nHS"
