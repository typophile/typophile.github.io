  find a nice sans with hi-contrasting thicks and thins.\r\n\r\nThere is an example
  of one along the lines of what i'm after here:\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/juraj-chrastina/kammerlander/|Kammerlander]]\r\n\r\nBut
  I would like one with more elegant and proportioned curves.\r\n\r\nI would like
  to thank everyone in advance for taking the time to help out  : )"

    preview. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/reserves/4675788094/\r\n\r\nIt is
    now mixed-case and more proportional. This was an early version preview. We might
    even release an unicase (uppercase) version with more eccentric proportions after
    the mixed-case releases."
