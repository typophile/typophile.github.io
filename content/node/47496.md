    Any suggestions?

  body: I must say this script looks quite unique -- the overall shapes are of the
    kind that is usually associated with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/features/newsletters/sep2006_a/">smooth
    scripts</a>, not rough edged ones. Do you prefer the actual letter shapes or the
    brush texture?

  body: "Thanks for expounding on the title of the thread, and for the suggestions.\r\n\r\nBald,
    to answer your question, I'm looking for as close of a match as possible. I like
    both the letter shapes and the brush texture. Though, if I had to choose between
    the two, i'd err on the side of the brush texture."

    \r\n\r\nFor now, I'm mocking up with \"Brubeck\" -- free from DaFont:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/search.php?psize=m&q=brubeck\r\n\r\nNot
    an exact match, but it attempts to maintain the feeling of the intended target."
