    very similar to Stymie, but more monoline.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Stymie1.png]"

  body: I think she's referring to the jaunty bodoni-esque font for the Late Night
    logo. The one that's not quite spumoni.

  body: FYI -- the old twentieth century lettering term for bouncy baseline informal
    alphabets was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=frisky&source=MyFonts.com&page=1"
    target="new">Frisky</a> which still seems to work well if used as a search term
    on MyFonts.com
