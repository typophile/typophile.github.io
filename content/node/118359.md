  such that each one of those typefaces could be readily distinguished from all the
  others in that set on the basis of a single character...\r\n\r\ninstead of saving
  ink and paper with such minor steps like having really short descenders and huge
  x-heights, each letter could now encode the letter following it in its typeface,
  thus cutting the length of texts almost in <strong>half</strong>!\r\n\r\nI'm assuming
  that for readability, words would still be separated with spaces, and so one might
  have a 27th neutral typeface for the last letter of words with an odd number of
  letters."

  body: "Well, I admit this proposal was made in jest.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a set of
    syllabary symbols into the Latin script similar to the Japanese katakana would
    be a simpler way to increase the density of texts.\r\n\r\nThe idea (if it wasn't
    obvious from the original post) was that, in one possible implementation of the
    scheme, a letter in Artistik is that letter followed by an A; a letter in Arnold
    Bocklin is that letter followed by a B; a letter in Cheltenham is that letter
    followed by a C; a letter in Lydian is that letter followed by an L; a letter
    in Optima is that letter followed by an O; a letter in Peignot is that letter
    followed by a P; that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nHowever, since this requires recognition
    dependent on fine details of the letters, the obvious refutation of this proposal
    is to present the clearly better alternative of reducing the type size by 30%."

    if you have 26 different typefaces to work with, then each typeface can stand
    for a different letter.\r\n\r\nSo if you have a letter, the letter it is stands
    for one letter, and the typeface it's in stands for the letter following.\r\n\r\nIf
    I omit all the letters, how can anyone see what typeface they're in? Or perhaps
    you meant that you thought I was omitting only the second letter of the word,
    instead of <em>every</em> second letter - omitting the fourth letter, because
    its identity is given by the typeface of the third letter, omitting the sixth
    letter, because its identity is given by the typeface of the fifth letter, and
    so on, also.\r\n\r\n<cite>Take it a step further and encode every word in the
    dictionary as one revival of the Garamond types.</cite>\r\n\r\nThere may be <em>enough</em>
    of them, but would they be easily enough distinguishable for the system to work?\r\n\r\nThus,
    there are even more than 676 typefaces in existence, but using the typeface of
    a letter to indicate the <em>two</em> letters following is clearly not practical.\r\n\r\nNow,
    another degree of freedom would be to use the Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, or Ethiopic
    scripts to represent letters. Or, to get enough visually distinct objects to represent
    all the words in the dictionary, there are Chinese characters. But while the Chinese
    characters map systematically to the syllables of Chinese, how would one map them
    to the words of English in a memorizable fashion?\r\n\r\nTo find a high-efficiency
    writing system for English, one option might be to adapt the Korean script..."
