body: 'This scan is a &#34;script style&#34; lettering from 1980 &#40;A High School
  sports award certificate&#41;.  It was done by a print shop except for date, which
  was later filled in with a typewriter- remember those?<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I would think both fonts would be rather common
  given the fact that the script style lettering was likely the print shops &#34;standard&#34;
  script font.  The Typewriter &#34;date&#34; font would also likely be a widely used
  font since it was used in a public high school athletic department. <BR> <BR>Can
  anyone identify: <BR>1.  The &#34;script style&#34; font? <BR> <BR>2.  The typewriter
  font used for the date &#40;&#34;25th&#34;&#41;?  <BR> <BR>I hope someone can help!

  body: I think the script is probably a small size of the ATF metal face Typo Script
    which doesn&#39;t seem to be available in digital format. A close alternative
    would be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palace-script/mt-semi-bold/testdrive.html?s=Given+at+Livon+This&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Palace Script</a>. <BR> <BR>For the typewriter font, check out

  body: Thank you to Dav&#40;id&#41;, Mark, and Mike! I appreciate your help. <BR>
    <BR>Dav&#40;id&#41;- The 2 and 5 in &#34;Tired of Courier&#34; was really close.  So
    much that I was surprised when I compared the numbers &#34;8&#34; and &#34;0&#34;
    that there was a difference in these number characters.  On my original, the &#34;0&#34;
    is Larger than the &#34;8&#34;, but it is the REVERSE in &#34;Tired of Courier&#34;
    &#40;see attachment below&#41;!? <BR> <BR>Mark- No match on the Vintage Typwriter
    Collection, but it is a good source for the future I wasn&#39;t aware of. <BR>
    <BR>Mike and Mark-  Great match on the &#34;script&#34; text! <BR> <BR> <BR>Tom
