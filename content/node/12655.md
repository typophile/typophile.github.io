  for self promotion purposes. I've come up with a name and an idea that I'm happy
  with based on my surname (Watt). I've discovered an amazing observation that a bit
  of a pun (using watt as the question 'what') and the connection to the unit of power
  can both be represented in one symbol because a question mark incredibly resembles
  the shape of a light bulb. \r\n\r\nAfter some development, I've arrived at this
  solution but I'd love to see what some of you guys think. Does it work? Is it too
  cliched? How would you tackle it or improve the idea? Obviously all comments and

  body: "Hi Ed,\r\nI think its good start, at least as far as the colours are concerned
    (the blue from the Scottish flag?), but without reading what your initial concept
    was (playing on the word Watt=name/lightbulb=idea) I don't think I would've \"got\"
    the meaning from the question mark logo. For further exploration I would look
    at:\r\n1. Your design style (ie, having an affinity toward Modern, Classical,
    post-Modern, etc) Its often helpful to get a second or third pair of eyes to look
    at one's work objectively. How could you represent that visually?\r\n2. How you
    tackle a design problem, and maybe turn it into a metaphor.\r\n3. If you really
    do wish to stick with the ? as the silhouette of a lightbulb, maybe make it more
    shadowy, or start with drawing the shadow of a real lightbulb so that it just
    happens to resemble a question mark. \r\nSometimes I've found it useful to do
    a whole lot of thumbnail sketches of ideas, and not get too hung up about the
    rendering. Sometimes that yields solutions I didn't think of before.\r\nHope that
    helps :)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDavid"

    see if people get the idea without the explanation.\r\n\r\nDavid - great suggestions
    but I have been through the sketching stage and I've gone for a modernist style
    because I think it does reflect my work well. As for the lightbulb - I don't mind
    it not being too literal, and the question mark should definitely be 'seen' first,
    which is working at the moment. I will try and strengthen the light bulb link.\r\n\r\nI
    am open to suggestions about changing the typography if it will improve the readability
    of 'what's his name'. Would lowercase work better? Different emphasis? Bolder
    forms? \r\n\r\nAlso does anyone have an opinion on using an icon at all? Maybe
    the 'watts'isname' is enough?\r\n\r\nEd"

    logo</a>. It's a 'W', was inspired by a light bulb - and most would recognize
    it as the great Paul Rand's work. If you modified it to fit within your logo,
    either with or without the image, I think it would show a knowledge/respect of
    the older design greats.  But then again, others may see it as plagerism\u2026\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like the mark...honestly, the second you said lightbuld I cringed, but
    I was surpised and relieved to see that you handled the image with such subtlety.
    I would not make the symbol any more obvious than it is...and from the rest of
    these posts i don't think that's a problem. I happened to see the lightbulb right
    off, but I guess I was looking for it.\r\n\r\nI wonder, though the image looks
    great and you have a lot to work with visually, is this really what you want to
    say about yourself as a designer? The question mark/lightbulb pairing sort of
    makes me think, \"where/what's the idea?\" It makes you look like an unsure designer,
    like you don't quite know what the product of your design process will be.\r\n\r\nI
    do like how you've played on the pronounciation of your name...it rings and catches,
    but it also raises more questions. What's his name? And in that case, where is
    he? and what does he do (since it isn't apparent that you're a designer through
    the mark alone, it actually looks like a lightbulb brand)?\r\n\r\nI don't mean
    to ramble. In sum I think visually its handled pretty sweetly, but conceptually
    I'm not sure it's the best idea to raise questions with your identity. The client
    probably wants to know you'll be answering the questions, not asking them."

  body: "Thanks all again, it's great to get some more opinions and feedback. Interesting
    how some of you are reading my name as 'watts'. I suppose the grammatically correct
    way to deal with this is \"watt's'isname\" since there are two letters missing,
    the I and the H. I decided that two apostrophies was ugly and hindered the reading
    dramatically but perhaps I've dropped the wrong one.\r\n\r\nI've tried your suggestion
    Dan, and a few variations on the apostrophe placement in the file attached.\r\n\r\nJay,
    It's a good point but I'm not too concerned about being subtle. The logo is something
    that will be seen over and over on any correspondence and so there's a lot of
    time for the idea to emerge. The <a href=\"http://www.onewatt.co.uk/wattsisname/globalhome_fedex_corp_logo.gif\">
    FedEx Logo</a> (famous 'subliminal arrow') is a good example of a subtle, almost
    hidden, extra and I quite like that idea.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJtyler, this really
    is a good point - one which I've struggled with since I got this idea. In some
    ways, a question mark is positive because it represents the problem solving process
    . . . But it also represents a problem - which is negative. It certainly gives
    off a message of uncertainty. As an icon, however, it raises the question 'where's
    the idea' - a perfect representation of my work as a positive question . . . because
    most of my work is based on a central idea and not just aesthetic or style. It
    could be almost a motto, as what I do is search for the idea - the solution. \r\n\r\nYou
    raised the issue of what do I want to say... well I want to say 'I am a good designer',
    and in my opinion, good design is design with an idea at the centre. I want to
    communicate an ability to 'see' things differently, expressing clever visual thinking
    and a high quality of execution.  \r\n\r\nThat's fine when it's explained though
    and you're right, what I should be saying is 'here are the ideas'or 'i have the
    ideas!'. Maybe I will drop the whole question mark icon - bulb thing and go with
    a logotype. The Watts'isname idea is quite strong on its own I suppose. Anybody
    got any thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main target audience for this identity is slightly
    uncertain because I'm putting toghether self promotional materials to try and
    get a job rather than finding more clients. Ideally I need something that works
    for both. I've thought about this and decided that designers will be impressed
    by good, effective design so if I concentrate on the clients as the main audience,
    the identity should work for designers as well.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've linked to
    two files, one working on the mark:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.onewatt.co.uk/wattsisname/wattIdMark25May.jpg\">
    Mark development</a>\r\n\r\nand this one for the logotype:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.onewatt.co.uk/wattsisname/wattIdLogotype25May.jpg\">

    I think it should be Watt'shisname or watt's'isname, though the latter is a bit
    odd. Maybe dash it out: watt's-his-name\r\n\r\nThat would make the What is his
    name?/Watt is his name thing a bit clearer.\r\n\r\nSo...uhh...in summary, I'd
    loose the abbrevaited 'his' and just spell it out. People SAY 'is but need to
    read his.\r\n\r\nI don't think you need the light bulb. Just keep it nice and
    simple with the question mark. The verbal pun is much more interesting than the

    that there's a little more going on, w/o shouting.\r\n\r\nRe: FedEx -- the difference
    between FedEx and your mark is that FedEx is the message, and the arrow is the
    bonus. The reason most people don't see the arrrow is they get the \"FedEx\" message
    and then move on. In your case, people might see the question mark, decide that
    your message equals \"huh?\" and move on before they realize there is something
    more subtle going on. IOW, you don't want the obvious message to be a bad one.
    The improved threads at the bottom is a very nice pointer that there's more here

    Ok here's the latest developments </a>\r\n\r\nI've tried to deal with some of
    the issues you have all raised, specifically: \r\n\r\n1. The readability of 'what's
    his name'\r\nAfter many different configurations and positioning of the apostrophies
    and word spaces, i've decided that maybe it reads best without any at all? I think
    the emphasis of 'Watt' is enough to communicate that it is my name, and the rest
    makes sense as you read it (I think!). It also looks cleaner.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The
    legibility of the pun in the mark.\r\nThe mark has been developed from idea b
    with the 3 diagonal threads. Good point about the printing problems Tim, I've
    addressed this by making the mark quite large in scale and scrapping the version
    where the mark is the same size as the letters. I've also made the lines thicker
    and reversed them so that there are two clear yellow lines rather than 3 white
    ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nJay, I think you're right about the FedEx thing and there definitely
    is an issue about my mark being a question. There's something about it I like
    though too - a question mark seems to be quite powerful - it grabs attention and
    forces investigation. Imagine a box with a question mark on the outside, it kind
    of says 'look inside me', if you know what I mean? I've been thinking about it
    and there are other positive points too and something quite ironic and interesting
    about making a mark out of something that almost asks 'where's the logo?'. It's
    almost an 'insert your logo here' statement. Anyway, I'm giving it another go
    but I may decide to drop it in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nDan, I'm in the design business.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments Paul. I'm partial to puns too. I love 'smile in your mind' design
    but I've heard widely varying opinions from a few professionals while on placements
    and from tutors etc. \r\n\r\nHere's a thought... how much does a pun improve a
    logo?"

  body: "watt,\r\n\r\nNot sure if I'm too late to comment, since I only just swung
    in, but I've got some observations that i hope you can make use of. I really like
    the possibilities here.\r\n\r\n1) I agree with everyone about the phrase. There
    are too many visual and verbal puns of equal importance that the viewer needs
    to untangle to 'get it'. Pick one and let the rest fall to the side or away completely.
    Personally, I'd make the sentence as easy as possible (removing the UKism) to
    read and focus on the 'watt as watts' & lightbulb elements. \"Watt is his name\"
    could work, because the question mark changes the meaning.\r\n\r\n2) I actually
    think your first lightbulb icon was the strongest. The newer ones seem to drift
    from the solidity of the first. I'd scale it back to the original and make subtler
    adjustments: Angle the thread, but don't narrow or widen the size of the period;
    in the U.S., the bottom of the threaded part is actually more of a trapezoid when
    seen from the profile. If that's true in the UK, then ditch the semi-circle. Perhaps
    try a thin weight for the hook in the ? because it's meant to represent the silhouette
    of the edge, and a thinner weight will make the lightbulb more obvious.\r\n\r\nI've
    created a quick digital sketch to give a clearer idea of what I'm saying. It emphasizes
    the lightbulb/wattage thing over the question mark/question thing and leaves the
    second layer as a reward for later examinations. (like the FedEx arrow) Here it
    is: http://currentconfig.com/images/watt_ex1.gif"
