body: "Hey. I'm getting married in January and trying to make choices on text for
  the invitations. We all know that Bickman was an incredible typographer but I'd
  like to use a script that hasn't been used on 90% of wedding invitations :)\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone suggest some really classic, beautifully swashed or not swashed fonts? \r\n\r\nI'm
  going to be crafting the invitations myself but, of course, printing the text and
  inserting it into the invitations.\r\n\r\nThanks! I appreciate.\r\n\r\nCarolann"

    classic english script, \r\nbut a very nice calligraphic italic and very rarely
    used. \r\nthere is a pdf on typophile!\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/29605?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
