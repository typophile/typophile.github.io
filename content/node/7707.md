body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Hello! <BR> <BR>I am currently
  finishing the lc glyphs of my first typeface, an - yet to be named - sans serif
  font. <BR> <BR>Before advancing too much I would appreciate some comments on this
  preview: <BR> <BR> <BR>I know there is still a lot of work to be done - especially
  with the e, r and s. <BR> <BR>How do you like the feel of it? does it feel too light
  for a regular? <BR> <BR>I would be grateful for some feedback - no need to be gentle!

  body: The &#39;g&#39; needs work. It&#39;s too big and the bottom story is too far
    from the top story. <BR> <BR>The &#39;e&#39; feels off balance. It looks like
    it

  body: It needs polishing but overall I think it&#39;s ok. You have good basic shapes,
    but need to polish the details, like the round terminals on the ascenders.

  body: Hi, Samann. <BR> <BR>Once again, I agree with Hrant -- the 3rd <b>h</b> is
    the one I like best, followed by the 4th one. <BR> <BR>As for your earlier questions...
    I like your typeface. It has a certain elegance. But yes, I feel that the <b>s</b>
    needs some work. And I agree with DeWitt&#39;s comments about the <b>e</b> and
    the <b>g</b>. <BR> <BR>I look forward to seeing more of your work!
