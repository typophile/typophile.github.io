  use Mensch Thin for a logo.\r\n\r\n1. I'm trying to find a font for a smaller size
  slogan that goes under the logo\r\n2. I'm looking for fonts that are on Typekit
  or Cufon elligible for a website design\r\n3. It would be nice to find a serif that
  goes well with Mensch\r\n\r\nIf anyone got ideas or examples of works using Mensch
  with other typefaces please share them :) \r\n\r\nBy the way, it's my first post
  on Typophile so I hope I didn't made any mistake aha"

  body: "I think most serifs, that aren\u2019t too humanist/bookish/friendly in style,
    work well with Mensch. For screen, try a slab-serif maybe. Kulturista or RePublic
    would be good matches, or Adelle or Museo Slab or, for smaller sizes too, Teimer
    (all on typekit)."
