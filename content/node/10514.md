  digitally &#40;this is a letterpress piece&#41;.  I&#39;m looking for an easy to
  set serif face with larger, just slightly ornamental caps &#40;like these&#41; with

    target="_blank">this thread</a> for more information &#40;there&#39;s lots of
    good stuff there&#41;. Those don&#39;t look like small caps but rather regular
    caps with the swash capitals. <a href="http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=415678&amp;ovmkt=JK0U0JDQ41GISCA7JS1RID2DCS"
