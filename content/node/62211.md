  who are just getting used to using typography, what would be an easy way to have
  them draw a pixel glyph or two? Draw on a grid in Photoshop OR sketch on a grid
  and then transpose into Photoshop? Ultimately I'd like them to each draw a glyph
  and then load them all into FontStruct so they can type with it. They will also
  make icons to match their letters--like an alphabet book. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
  a good process, (number of pixels) size to start with and a file resolution to suggest?\r\nor
  a good link that describes this?\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n \r\n"

    week to make a poster with a hierarchy that incorporates every typeface designed
    by all students in the class. The results will be horrid, but they\u2019ll learn
    a lot."

    Illustrator would be easier to use for this.

    bitmap fonts used in Oslo\u2019s subway is really horrible. Maybe you could have
    them create something like that, something with very specific requirements?"

  body: Interesting idea. But what exactly are you hoping to have the students learn
    by building pixel fonts? An understanding of letter shapes? Wouldn't an Illustrator
    exercise to build a vector character do that better?

  body: 'Don raises an interesting point: is this exercise about drawing letters or
    about type design? If your goal is to put the students on a path to drawing letters
    competently, a vector exercise with one or two letters makes sense. But if your
    goal is to shine a light on the complexities of typeface design, a pixel font
    is a better way to go.'

    and easy to figure out. Fire it up, set the height and start bashing out pixels.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you can find some ancient abandonware pixel font editors that still run on a modern

  body: "I find it good to start by defining the intended use of the font, and from
    there the grid size (the total height in pixels), weight, width and style.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/\">FontStruct</a> is very easy to use and
    is great for designing bitmap fonts \u2014 students can test the fonts on real
    size on screen as they are designing it. Photoshop can be used to make a nice
    test/sample document with the generated fonts.\r\n\r\n(I have developed a <a href=\"http://www.hipertipo.org/pdfs/ElementarTYPO27.pdf\">parametric
    method for designing bitmap fonts</a>, you might find it useful as a reference.)\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps,\r\nGustavo.\r\n"

  body: "An advantage to using pshop could be the block brush and block eraser in
    a small file such as 8 x 8 pixels. Especially since you say their are new to type,
    using new software could detract from focusing on the bitmap process or letterforms
    (whichever it is).\r\n\r\nPersonally I think coloring/erasing/reworking squares
    on graph paper would be more fun! Maybe let them choose their method.\r\n\r\nThe
    task itself could be to choose their name or a word and render it in several different
    grid heights, in the same \"style\" as much as possible. I.e. don't switch from
    a sans to a slab. That way they have to decide if the higher rez versions reflect
    their \"original\" idea for the typeface or if it resembles more of an 8 x 8 for
    consistency's sake.\r\n\r\n"

    series). If the grid is anything as low as ten (or less) height, there are not
    enough different ways to construct the letterforms, it will all look pretty much
    the same.

    out on graph paper then develop in fontstruct. My students this year were resistant
    to developing ideas on paper. For the most part, the initial \"hamburgefonts\"
    graph paper concepts were poor...not sure why. I think it would be easier to use
    .psd than .ai for their initial concepts for reasons listed on an earlier post.
    My only concerns about using an application to flesh out a concept versus hand
    rendering is that they will get too caught up in the tool and not the idea.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\n\r\nBTW - I do encourage the students to use larger grids as a
    way of developing more detail so there is more variety."
