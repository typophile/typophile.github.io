  body: "The (badly) connected script at the bottom is Cool Air Conditioner a free
    font at <a href=\"http://www.fontdiner.com/main.html\">Font Diner</a>. The other
    script may be hand-drawn, but check out the other Font Diner selections -- maybe
    that's where the designer did his/her shopping.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Ricks looks like a monoline version of Murry Hill or Phyllis to me, but there
    are other fonts with a very simalar look, my favorite being <a href=\"http://letterheadfonts.com/contributors/charlesborges/bouncescript.shtml\">Bounce
