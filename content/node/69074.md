  you'll like it.\r\n\r\nBy posting here i would like to come up with two questions:\r\n\r\nFirst
  is if you have any ideas for another name of this font - i don't really like \"daluxe\"
  very much.\r\n\r\nThe second is an issue that propably comes from my missing knowledge:
  When i preview the font in fontLab it the anti-alias is more or less fine. When
  i export the font as OTF and use it in Photoshop the anti-aliasing is quite ugly:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_4580.jpg]\r\n\r\nDo
  you have suggestion how i could solve this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nChristian\r\n\r\n[Edit
  - somehow attached file was missing]"

  body: "I think it's quite nice.\r\n\r\nBut you should check the widths, as riccard
    said. the middle of your lowercase 'p' looks a little too large in comparison
    with your other letters.\r\n\r\nAlso, the tail of your lowercase 'e' might be
    a little too short.\r\nThe left edge is also too straight, it does't match the
    overall roundness of your font.\r\n\r\nThe uppercase 'R' is in need of a bit more
    elegance... the shape is neither round, neither straight.\r\n\r\nThe uppercase
    'O' is too large when looking at the other characters, the inner space is too
    wide.\r\n\r\nWatch out for the lowercase 'a', the shape gets filled up at the
    bottom. Try to place the lower tail upwards or something?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    you're well on the way. Keep us informed!"

  body: "Thank you very much for your comments and sorry that i did not answer so
    far - i thought i get an email when some one replied (So for - my shame - i forgot
    it).\r\n\r\nI did not work on it further so i don't have news on the font but
    with the stroke widths i have a little problem: I'm quite sure that i worked with
    the same withs on each letter because i used grid lines to \"measure\" that but
    anyway they look different. Could it be that for those letters where the width
    seems different i simply should not trust the grid but my look? Is that common
    in typography? I see this problem on the C,S and U - do you see some more?\r\n\r\nWith
    the \"p\" its funny - it's the very same shape as the a,b,d,q,p and the upper
    part of the q. So they all should have the same problem as the a has. There i
    have the problem that i can not take the lower tail up cause then the entire letter
    seems lower, i can not lengthen the edge and i would not like to miss the round
    corner between edge and tail :S\r\n\r\n@tourdeforce: This upper image was the
    best that i could get out of the a-a in photoshop - do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nBest
    regards,\r\nChristian"

  body: What you did with the bowls is logical, but just seems 'wrong'. Either the
    straight strokes need to be longer or you make the whole thing round. This way
    it seems as if was a circle, but pieces have ben cut off. I like the idea of the
    font and for a first one it's certainly not bad. You need to put some more time
    in the spacing. for instance 'th' in 'that' needs more whitespace. For the problem
    with the a you should higher the part thats right of the bottom nodes in the bowl.
    Furthermore you should cut of a piece of the vertical stroke so that it's thinner
    at the bottom. Hope you get what I mean. the same thing should be done with the
    h.

    this will probably solve the a-issue. I'll try that as soon as i have time. With
    the spacing you're very right - i'm not yet satisfied with that too but i'm working
    on it.\r\n\r\ntourdeforce, the attached pdf above (that is an export from fontlab)
    is okay for me - it's just that i work with photoshop quite often. Thats why I'ld
    like this font to render better even because other fonts render good in PS. But
    as there are no settings or anything maybe i should not care to much about that^^\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nChristian"
