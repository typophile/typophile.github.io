  body: forgot to say this was Maz shot by me at St. Brides Library in one of the
    back rooms. It is a great setting for librarians. And a large donation was made
    to Maz and St. Brides library by me but not as large as the Peter Saville photoshoot
    budget which should have gone to St. Brides instead. Commercial twits...
