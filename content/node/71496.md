  to build a display font for a client which I've done. They are now requesting cyrillic
  & greek extensions for other territories to use. Now what I'm wondering is what's
  the norm for this, ie. do you build the extra glyphs into the same font as extra
  unicode characters or do separate font files for the European, Cyrillic and Greek
  versions?\r\nThanks in advance, any help is gratefully appreciated!\r\nSi"

    characters, they preferred that all of the characters be in one font. You might
    ask your commissioners what <em>their</em> preference is...
