  you need to space them and kern them at the metrics windows...\r\n\r\nHow the heck
  do you do it? I mean, It's difficult to create lines of texts in small caps at the
  metrics windows...\r\n\r\nDo you use the preview window?  / Do you put each smcp
  character separately at the metrics window? / Do you use some kind of awesome kerning
  preview text?\r\n\r\n<strong>What I'm really asking is:\r\nIs there any way to magically
  substitute lower case letters for small caps at the metrics windows so I can space
  them without having a headache? </strong>\r\n\r\nAs always thanks for the help!
  :)"

  body: "I can imagine!  But eliason's page helps!\r\n\r\nI was thinking, that perhaps
    the best thing is to create another font file and put the SMCP in the lowercase
    glyphs... and then try and joing them by exporting the kern and adding \".smcp\"
    suffix with a program like sublime text (which is very helpful for those things)...
    But, it would take some time, \r\n\r\nAnyway,  thanks for solving my existential
    doubt :)"

  body: "One common trick is to type/paste your string into the OpenType Features
    tab of the Preview panel, activate the feature (in this case SMCP), then copy
    the slash-coded string from the bottom of the panel into the Metrics window. If
    it's something you're likely to reuse, you can also add it to the list of preview
    strings (the Options '...' button in the Metrics window or Preview panel).\r\n\r\nOr,
    if you happen to be using Windows, the [[http://www.fontlab.com/front-page/featured-product/introducing-fontlab-studio-5-2-for-windows/|FontLab
    5.2 Public Preview version]] supports OpenType features in the Metrics window."

    click the glyph you want to change, and use CRTL+mousewheel to switch to next
    glyph. No tedious typing involved.  There are also keyboard shortcuts for it,
    but they seem to differ in platform, version and language of your keyboard ..."
