body: "The attached PNG is from a sanned page out of a Teletype (r) service manual
  that was originally printed in the 1930-1940s It is one of the pages that is a list
  of parts. The font is different then that used in the main body of the manual. My
  guess printed from punch cards, and if so could be IBM.\r\nUnique attributes are
  for example the number 8 has a flat line at around 10 degrees from the top. The
  base of the numbers varies\r\nThe 1, 2, 6, 8, 0 are at the character base\r\nThe
  3, 4, 5, 7, 9 descend below\r\nAgain the 8 is very unique\r\n\r\nThe serif on the
  lower case y really stands out, and well as the lower case g\r\nI don't think they
  match any of the fonts used by Teletype for their printers.\r\n\r\n-pete"
