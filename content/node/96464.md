  body: My pleasure. Someone at Typophile recently made a request for us specify how
    we come by our answers. I use WhatTheFont, WhatFontIs, FindMyFont etc.... but
    occasionally, the odd one can be retrieved from the old memory banks  ;-)

  body: "@All: The reason us old guys can do it from memory is that we started before
    computers and internet. We didn\u2019t have fancy software or forums. We had \u201Cbooks.\u201D
    \u201C<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=p-book\">P-books</a>\u201D
    at that.\r\n\r\nIt was only from repeat exposure that, over time, we formed strong
    associative neural pathways which lead us to develop \u201Clong term memory.\u201D\r\n\r\nWe
    couldn\u2019t ask Bing, Google was a funny word that had something to do with
    numbers, and you were probably just a twinkle in someone\u2019s eye.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    really simple. Taking advantage of your resources to assist in efficient problem
    solving only makes sense. But the skills development in the what I dub the \u201CSearch
    versus Solve\u201D dichotomy still remains.\r\n\r\nIn two proverbs:\r\n\r\n\u201C<em>Give
    a man a fish, and you feed him for a Day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him
    for a lifetime</em>.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\u201C<em>Practice makes perfect</em>.\u201D\r\n\r\nMy
    advice? Just spend the money on a HARD COPY of the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook/\">FontBook</a>,
    bust out a pencil and sketchbook, and flip through a few pages every morning with
    your coffee. Take notes and sketch key letters. If memory serves, FontBook doesn\u2019t
    show complete alphabets. <strong>Very</strong> disappointing, but a good start.
    Always keep your eyes peeled for good specimen books. Another one in my library
    I quite enjoy reading is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/American-Metal-Typefaces-Twentieth-Century/dp/0938768344\">American
    metal typefaces of the twentieth century</a>. Many specimens are accompanied by
    a short historical paragraph. A fun read. Don\u2019t waste your money on a paperback.
    Hunt for a deal on a hard-cover. The paperback will simply fall apart within a
    year.\r\n\r\nNo go! go off into the world of \u201CPaper\u201D and explore! Be
    free!!\r\n\r\nFrom the film Kung-Fu: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCyJRXvPNRo\r\nCaine:

    it that you can not?"

  body: "Sorry Christopher, but speak for yourself. I've been using computers from
    way before I was aware of type, and I only started talking to other people about
    type thanks to Typo-L. I've never spent an inordinate amount of time perusing
    printed specimen books, and don't recommend killing more trees just to get better
    at ID-ing fonts. But that doesn't mean I don't appreciate real talent and skill
    at ID-ing fonts; running software to do it for you might be more efficient for
    the person you're helping, but it doesn't really help the person doing it get
    better at anything (and thereby helping others in more significant ways).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    ways</em>).\r\n\r\n\u201C<em>Surely, the most important thing is to learn and
    try to remember</em>.\u201D\r\n\r\nMy points exactly. Using software and getting
    someone to do your work for you is not helping them learn. Yes, it\u2019s taking
    advantage of valuable resources, but it ultimately stunts their ability to do
    it themselves. Perhaps I\u2019m living in the past. I\u2019ve also made the same
    point before in that if we as a community take care of other people\u2019s leg
    work, they aren\u2019t going to develop those muscles, and 10 years from now we\u2019ll
    have a weaker community. A difficult balance, and obviously the solution lies
    in a combination of both, but all too many times I see \u201Cdo my homework\u201D
    \u201Cwhat\u2019s this font\u201D and a plethora of students doing a simple Google
    image search and slapping some type on it (which someone else probably told them
    to use), or even worse, \u201Cffffinding\u201D a solution and ripping it off.
    It\u2019s really simple from where I stand. If your first line of attack is to
    ask Wikipedia, you are stunting your problem solving skills. I would match any
    stake that this will become a very important conversation in the next few years
    in the fields of sociology, cultural anthropology, heck, even neuropsychology
    (if it isn\u2019t already).\r\n\r\nAnd as far as trees go, don\u2019t get me started.
    The carbon footprint of the computer you are using right now is ridiculous compared
    to that of a book. Computers are made from finite mineral resources and (currently)
    powered by petroleum products which the world is at war over. That, and trees
    are a renewable resource which can lead towards a sustainable economy. <em>And</em>
    high quality acid-free paper is by far in a way the most stable way to archive
    information. #rant"
