    version of something like this. You might check out FontDiner.com as well, they
    have a lot of retro fonts.'

  body: Pretty sure this is an old metal face by Monotype called Sans Serif Medium
    Condensed. It was very similar to Kabel, but had alternate characters so it could
    also mimic popular faces like Futura (hence the "g").

  body: 'Thanks for your help, guys! Burbank looks similar, and nice, but a little
    more groovy and hand-lettered than I''m looking for. It''s a shame Sans Serif
    Medium Condensed was never digitized (I''m assuming it wasn''t; with a name like
    that it seems like it''d be virtually impossible to search for it online). '

    DT Condensed</a> is fairly close, although it doesn't have the alternate "g" and
    the stroke endings are horizontal. And the apostrophe is different. And the weight.
    Okay, not that close, but Kabel was what Sans Serif was more or less copied from.
