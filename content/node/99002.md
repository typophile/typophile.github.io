body: "This is the first real font I've ever designed and this is my project for my
  diploma. It's planned as a font for headlines and sub-headlines in a culture magazine
  (It doesn't necessarily have to work under 14p). I know that it has small serifs,
  but I decided to post it into the sans-serif forum nonetheless since I don't really
  know where to post it otherwise. It's not a serif font because there are only serifs
  at the bottom and not on every glyph.\r\n\r\nI can't present much, I've just done
  the lower cases, but I hope that I'm going to get some useful feedback here in what
  I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong.\r\n\r\nI just probably also mention that
  these took me quite a while, so it's definitely something I scrapped together in
  one session. I also just noticed, as I was typing with it, that f, t and i and so
  on, appear to be a little too thin compared to the rest... But I'll leave it here
  for now.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/4271/font01500.png\"></img>\r\n<img

  body: "Hm, I think it works quite well here, but it's definitely a problem when
    I use it at a smaller scale.\r\nThe a, e and w also have a different level of
    grey when I use it at let's say... 12p. So that's still something I need to work
    on.\r\n\r\nAnd I meant to say that it's definitely -not- something I scrapped
    together in one session obviously."

  body: "So I thought I'd post an update, since it's about two months since I posted
    those previews. I did some minor changes and added capitals. I'm still unsure
    of what it's name is going to be, but I'm thinking of \"Sibra\". Cap height is
    a little lower than the ascender.\r\n\r\nFeedback and critiques are very welcome.\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "I have to say, even if I know it is hybrid, that when I'm looking at this
    font I'm confused. I can see some concepts in it, but no one is actually the main
    one. Some quick ideas:\r\n\r\n- /a and /s with large aperture - /c and /e with
    small aperture , why not the same?\r\n- /t without tail is not gonna work in small,
    can be confused with /lslash\r\n- /h, /n, /m, /u and /b, /d, /p, /q are usually
    with same idea\r\n- /s seems the upper part bigger, usually it's reversed\r\n-
    /S weird middle part\r\n\r\n- These small serifs are there why? Do you have any
    system for putting them on the letters? Why is on the stem of /k present and on
    the tail not?\r\n\r\nCan you put some texts here? \r\nJan"

  body: "Your /R and /P have very small bowls - they look the same as the top part
    of /B, where normally they're larger.  In the /R especially this results in an
    unusually long leg that looks awkward to my eyes.\r\n\r\nThe upper counter in
    /A is also a bit cramped IMO.  \r\n\r\nThe spines of /s and /S look a bit pinched
    in the centre; in most fonts this is optically the fattest part."
