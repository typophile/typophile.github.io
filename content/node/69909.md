  the shapes repeat. (for example, the n in Chardonnay, the a appears flipped)\r\n\r\nAny

    in Greece.\r\nI started this hand drawn, based on stephen sprouse sprayed type.
    It's not a font YET. And you're right i flipped the A in Chardonnay, because it
    matches better with the gap before the Y. All letters are in vector format.\r\n\r\nHere's
    another photo, with all packs (including cabernet sauvignon)\r\n\r\n[[http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=31053736&id=1538256245]]"
