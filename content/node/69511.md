    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=eurostile+extended&x=0&y=0\">Eurostile
    Extended</a>?\r\nFor more personality, Carl Crossgrove's new <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/702864/biome-family.html\">Biome</a>.
    He says it's a display face, but IMO it does pretty good text as well.\r\nAnd
    somewhat off the wall, picking up on the unicase style of Armchair, my own <a

  body: "hi nick, \r\n\r\nthanks for the suggestions. actually i'm looking for one
    that will work at small sizes (like 14pt) like on a drinks menu when armchair
    is used for the bar's logo on that menu. \r\nyou're suggestions would definately
    work, but i'm looking for a more clearly \"visual difference\" on that 2 faces...
    i will give biome a try nevertheless. i guess even it's maybe more a display face,
    it's fine using it for the \"drinks-menu-purpose\". \r\n\r\nthanks: lars"
