    for my school's newspaper concerning file sharing. Jobs is absolutely correct.
    DRM has failed, and will continue to fail as long as it exists.\r\n\r\nIt basically
    boils down to this: If I want the latest CD, font, program, etc., DRM is not going
    to stop me from having it. Everything and everything that can be put into a computer
    can/will be/has been on a file sharing network, and there's nothing that Jobs
    or iTunes can do to stop it.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that will stop someone from
    downloading illegally is that old-fashioned thing called a conscience. And unfortunately,
    a conscience requires morals, which our society has basically done away with."

  body: "\"It\u2019s about time. If Apple ditched their screwball DRM system \"\r\n\r\nThe
    point of Jobs article is that this is NOT Apple's decision. It's the RIAA's decision.
    It's out of his hands to a large extent.\r\n\r\nAnd he's getting pinched...by
    countries like Norway which is trying to ban Fairplay, and up-and-coming DRM-free
    options like eMusic.\r\n\r\nHe's in a bind, and (rightfully so, IMHO) pointing
    the spotlight at the RIAAs rather illogical hang-up on DRM.\r\n\r\n\"I might start
    buying music online again\u2014right now I\u2019ve given up on the iTunes store
    because the DRM is bugger.\"\r\n\r\nCheck out eMusic!\r\n\r\n\"The only thing
    that will stop someone from downloading illegally is that old-fashioned thing
    called a conscience.\"\r\n\r\nI completely disagree on numerous counts. First
    of all, I don't think sharing music you like is necessarily 'immoral'. It's something
    kids have been doing for decades. Mix tapes are a staple of our pop culture. Burning
    more than a handful of CDs and selling them at $5 a pop? That's crossing the line.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    not everyone downloads 'illegally' because they just want it for free...it's often
    because it's the more convenient option. \r\n\r\nThe reason iTunes (IMHO) succeeded
    early on is that it is a VERY easy system to use. They had a large library, and
    a single double-click gets it to your HD in a few minutes. At the time, this was
    actually a LOT easier than hitting bitTorrent or Napster.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we
    do want to shine a light on consumer 'immorality' then we need to shine a brighter
    light on corporate 'immorality'. The RIAA hasn't exactly been an innocent 'victim'
    in all of this despite what their PR machine has told us.\r\n\r\nMy recent rant
    on a fight with DRM:\r\n\r\nhttp://mnteractive.com/archive/fischer-price-fp3-player-headaches-for-dad/\r\n"

    It\u2019s something kids have been doing for decades.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty hard
    to copy LPs until cassetes came along. So don't act like this has always been
    the case. And just because people have been doing it for a long time doesn't make
    it right.\r\n\r\nI get royalty checks every quarter and know that I have missed
    out on a lot of money due to copying.\r\n\r\nBut - I am also against DRMs. It
    is not stopping anyone so what's the point?\r\n\r\npeace"
