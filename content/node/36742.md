  main is small caps). It is available at myfonts.\r\n\r\nwww.myfonts.com/fonts/corradine/garabata\r\n\r\nThere
  is a PDF file showing its main characteristic features. \r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nManuel

    the name, though I must confess it doesn't look garabatey to me at all! I liked
    it a lot. Congratulations on it. Saludos desde Coacalco, Mexico!\r\n\r\nLetrizmo

  body: 'I agree. It got a bit wild when using a lot of caps (like: "Si Ya Te Vas"),
    but for regular text it is very cool.'

  body: "I'm usually in favor of 'the more options, the merrier', but I would imagine
    that smallcaps would be more appropriate for a font without the flamboyant personality
    of this one. But I have been known to be wrong, so if you feel it, go for it.\r\n;

    quite good.\r\n\r\nIs it me or does it have sort of a Middle Eastern look?"

  body: "Thanks for your comments.\r\nRespect to the Middle Eastern look, it could
    be related. Garabata was made thinking about a mystic, misterious and antiqued
    style."
