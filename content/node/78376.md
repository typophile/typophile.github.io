  that some glyphs i made don't have a unicode assigned to them just \"---\" \r\nHow
  do i go about giving them a unicode and where do i for example find out what the
  unicode name is for ligatures such as f_k & f_h\r\n\r\nanny help is much appreciated"

    have a unicode however. They are accessed by an OpenType feature. \r\nIn addition
    you might assign a Unicode value from the Private Use Area (PUA), but that is
    mostly not recommendable. "

  body: "Basically, from the Unicode point of view, a text consists of letters and
    no ligatures. A ligature is just a device used by a font to present the text in
    the traditional appearance people are comfortable with.\r\n\r\nOf course, this
    assumes that the writing system is sufficiently simple that it is, in fact, reasonable
    to expect that an algorithm that can be coded inside a font will be sufficient
    to apply the rules for ligature use. If, instead, the appropriate and reasonable
    solution is for ligatures to be inserted manually by the typist when they are
    appropriate - and when preparing texts that are going to be used for printing
    and display, and not for other types of machine input - then this aspect of the
    philosophy of Unicode fails.\r\n\r\nIn Burmese, for example, the technology required
    to print Burmese properly using Unicode Burmese as input is not yet standard -
    so users make do with fonts that have extra characters in unused Unicode positions
    in the Burmese block, because that is the most convenient thing to do, at least
    in the short run.\r\n\r\nCertainly, it is at least awkward, using, say, a Unicode
    Arabic font, to use it to type a table of the glyphs that font can generate. One
    can't do that simply by typing, with tabs, the characters of those glyphs if some
    of those glyphs don't exist as characters. Putting every glyph in a font in the
    Private Use Area solves <em>that</em> particular problem, of course."

  body: "Evie,\r\n\r\nYour f_k ligature (and f_b and f_h) are just like other ligatures.
    Go look at the features code for a font -- say, an Adobe font. Just do the same
    thing -- add them to your liga list.\r\n\r\nIf you are making a Type 1 font, no
    Unicode is involved. You just name them. And if for older, hard-wired encoding
    system, you'll have to lie about the name. \"product\" and \"integral\" were common.
    Here's the problem. When you print text using your font, if those names were in
    the file, everything will look fine. Change fonts, or reuse the text, and that
    text is no longer correct.\r\n\r\nUnicode and OpentType work together to avoid
    these problems. Your f_k ligature is so named, and has no unicode number. In the
    font features file under \"liga\" you add\r\n\r\nsub f k by f_k\r\n\r\nAny text
    (Kafka) set using your font will use the f_k ligature, with the single characters
    f and k preserved in the file.   \r\n\r\nJohn:\r\n\r\nLet's suppose you make a
    PDF. Then you extract text. What happens to the characters that were in the Private
    Use Area? Gone, aren't they. Let's suppose you export XML from a file that had
    characters in the Private Use area. What happens? Problem, isn't it.\r\n\r\nSo
    yes, there are reasons to use the PUA, but they come with severe compromises.
    If a ligature is needed for a font, but not a language, as, for example, is the
    case with all the f-ligatures in English, they should follow the usual convention.
    Do not put them in PUA, nor given a Unicode number. Even if ligatures are needed
    for a language, as with Arabic, there are ways to avoid PUA usage. PUA is for
    *characters* that just do not exist in Unicode, and are not constructions of characters
    already within the encoding."
