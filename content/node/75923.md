    stroke widths though, unless I''m mistaken. '

  body: i can "slightly" see hints of it wanting to be serif on the l and the N but
    its so subtle  that i would say its customized on the 2 letters from arial. the
    main thing that leads me to say this is that the X has no hint of a serif...

  body: It's close to Arial, but it's not. I just placed your jpeg in illustrator
    and type in Arial over it, and there are some difference. The angle on the stroke
    of the "e" is different, the opening to the counter in the "c" is more closed
    in Arial, the way the arm joins the stem in the "n" is different. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/excelence_6485.jpg]
