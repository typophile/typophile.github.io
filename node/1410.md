body: This seems rediculous. A customer has trouble installing a font in Mac OS X.
  Has Mac changed the system? I am running a version of System 9.  <BR> <BR>Yes, we
  are running behind. <BR> <BR>All the same. I can not duplicate the customers problem.
  They have several fonts so it is not, probably, a font specific problem! <BR> <BR>What
  could be wrong? <BR> <BR>Reportedly it reads, &#34;You can not change the system.&#34;  <BR>
  <BR>I feel extra stupid, our e-mail has not been functioning and I am late? <BR>
  <BR>Could someone help soon. Please! <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR>Lanston Type
