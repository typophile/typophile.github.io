body: "I'm developing a font with large language support. The Eng uses a typical combination:
  N with J-descender (still a bit fat at the junction, I will fix it). The same for
  eng, based on n with j-descender. The design is is also coherent with other glyphs:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eng02_4032.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Eng
  and other glyphs with J descender.<em>\r\n\r\nHausa and other West African languages
  uses a glyph defined by Unicode as N with left hook. In all fonts with this glyph
  (there is a demo list [[http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/19d/fontsupport.htm#|here]])
  it is build the same way as Eng, just with J-descender at the left.\r\n\r\nAs the
  glyph is supposed to have a <strong>hook</strong>, the J-descender solution may
  be incorrect in my font as its shape cannot be considered a hook \u2013actually,
  it's very far from this. So, I designed it with a real hook:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eng01_4364.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Eng,
  N with left hook and N wit left J-descender.</em>\r\n\r\nThere are many other glyphs
  with hooks in a variety of positions. Almost all came from African languages and
  are in Latin Extended-B block of Unicode. I designed them always with the same approach:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eng03_4899.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Various
  glyphs with hook, mainly from West Africa.</em>\r\n\r\nThe <strong>question</strong>:
  must I keep this design for N with left hook, using an actual hook, or simply go
  with the general trend and use the J-descender? Wouldn't be strange to have two
  Ns with different descenders, even considering the glyph is supposed to have a hook?\r\n\r\nBy
  now, these are the UC/lc pairs I'm using:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eng05_4678.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Eng/eng
  and N/n with left hook.\r\n\r\nI know this is a very specific question, but any
  ideas about the best way to design this N with left hook are very welcome. Thanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Igor, this is completely speaking with no familiarity with the languages
    concerned, but it seems logical to me to keep the hook distinct from the Eng shape.
    To be sure you'd have to know whether the function of a hook is the same on an
    N as on another letter...difficult as this letter seems to be used for different
    languages. Even in IPA it seems the hook has different functions (implosive and
    ejective). However, I'd imagine the Eng has less to do with an N than does an
    N-hook, so I'd keep the shapes different.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could put together a
    full list of all the questions you've asked about unusual letters, with their
    conclusions and illustrations, as a reference for other designers?"

  body: "Ben and Riccardo, thank you very much. Both ideas are welcome.\r\n\r\nI did
    a try using different hook shape. Another change is small increment in first stem
    thickness, to compensate its tall gain with hook. This sample also shows alternate
    Engs for some African languages:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eng06_5548.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Eng,
    alternate eng and N-left-hook.</em>\r\n\r\nI did not use any ball-like terminal
    in this font. So, this second hook may fit better the general design, what is
    more evident in IPA characters:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eng04_3727.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Characters
    with hook from IPA block.</em>\r\n\r\nTo bring together information about various
    uncommon characters is a very good initiative. But following the wiki article
    created by Riccardo, I cannot find the <em>Characters</em> subsection in the <em>How-tos</em>
    section. I just find <em>Characters</em> link through <em>Design international
    characters</em> subsection. Maybe a small correction is needed there.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thread I begun about this kind of characters is [[http://typophile.com/node/73886|here]].\r\n\r\nAs
    we're talking about uncommon characters, here ase some really tricky to me:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unusual_5958.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>More
    unusal characters.</em>\r\n\r\nQuatrillo with comma is maybe the greater sin I
    made until now as I choose to melt the comma and base character to avoid confusion
    with comma itself. G with central stroke is not in Unicode and is used only in
    Kadiweu language, a native amerindian from Southwest Brazil. The others are in
    Unicode, but its design was not so easy to me."

    Latin-script languages. It gone much longer than I planned. Firstly, it were 500+

    I'll need to take a break from this before become crazy.\r\n\r\nYou're right,
    there are slight different hooks mixed on IPA characters. I'm still testing the

    used for Africanist phonetics. It's also in Shona, a language from Zimbabwe, Zambia
    and Botswana, with about 11+ million speakers. The character was used between
    years 1932 and 1955, but was dropped because no typewriter could produce it.\r\n\r\nInclusion

    much the same I face(d) when designing Andron. Mostly quirksome nasty glyphs invented

    you climb onto the 6.400 glyphs mark? With Latin/Greek/Cyrillic/-Extensions only?
    Which writing systems is your font to cover? (Just in case this is not a business
    secret ;-)\r\nBut I\u2019m seriously disturbed by the prospect of getting outleveled
    by your project. Andron Mega Regular has about 5.500 glyphs only  :-("

  body: "<cite>I track your glyphic considerations with much sympathy</cite>\r\n\r\nIt's
    really fine to hear that from the man behind such a masterpiece like Andron!\r\n\r\n<cite>How
    do you climb onto the 6.400 glyphs mark?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe way I wrote was somewhat
    misleading. The project is not so rich as a font like yours. Actually, it's far
    from this. Latin is the only script supported, besides phonetics (IPA, APA and
    some unnofficial).\r\n\r\nThe total of glyphs became so huge because this font
    has uppercase, lowercase, small caps, petite caps and swashes. There are alternates
    for |Q|W|a|b|g|q|y|, what multiply the number of glyphs (just lowercase a, with
    two alternates, produces 120+ glyphs).\r\n\r\nBesides the letters themselves,
    there are glyphs which varies with uppercase and small caps: combining diacritics
    (all), punctuation (partial), maths symbols (partial) and currency symbols (partial).
    Numbers also elevate the account, with ten sets: default, uppercase, oldstyle,
    small caps and petite caps, each one in proportional and tabular variants.\r\n\r\nI
    also added enclosed A-z and numbers, a set of arrows and more mathematical symbols
    than usual. All this caused the project to go so far. BTW, you don't need to be
    disturbed because I probably will drop the swashes set from this version. It's
    so much work for a lone life (how to draw a swash for B-with-hook or Tresillo?).
    For release 2.0, if I reach age 117, it would include complete swashes and Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nI'll
    send you a private message regarding the other topics."
