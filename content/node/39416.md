  tell me, is there a version of Eras for the Mac that coverts to outlines correctly,
  i.e. with the correct slant and thick/thin? \r\n\r\nWith the version I have, ITC
  Eras is how it shows in the font list (from Adobe?), it prints correctly but when
  converted in Illustrator the paths are like a cheap knockoff - right basic letter
  forms but upright and worst of all uniform in weight, which is of course not what
  Eras is all about. \r\n\r\nI've always wondered if there's a technical reason this
  font can't be made to outline properly although it seems like it should be possible
  given the characteristics of fonts that do convert OK.\r\n"

  body: It's very likely that nobody else has encountered your problem, and it may
    not be the fault of the font. Maybe you should post an image of the results so
    people can get a better idea of what you're talking about.

  body: "Yes, that would be it. You have the \"old\" version of Eras from the early
    90s, and when converting to outlines you are getting the \"low-res\" set of outlines.\r\n\r\nTime
    to update the font!\r\n\r\nT"
