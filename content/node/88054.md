    on the right column.\r\nPisco\u2019s sample is a script, which unfortunately I

  body: "Pisco, how can we be sure these are not hand-drawn letters? Do you have more
    samples that show repeated letters? I looked at this in the e-mail you sent me,
    and i do not think it looks like a font, but I would have a better idea if I saw
    more letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    tried to draw a more polished version of the same letters. It's JonahFonts <a
    href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-BcETP7\">\"Palazzo Solo\"</a>.  The basic shapes,
    at least for these letters, seem very similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
