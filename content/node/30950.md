  Is the cost worth the benefits? Thoughts and opinions on it in general?\r\n\r\nWhen
  I was working in New Brunswick nobody really cared about it. My boss and 2 of my
  colleagues were members but no one talked about it and outside of the plaques there
  wasn't much sign they even belonged to it. Where I'm at now, several people are
  members including the art directors. They're trying to convince me to join but I
  really don't know what the draw would be to it.\r\n\r\nHelp shine some light on
  this if you please."

    need.\r\n\r\nInteresting that you're asking that question now: GDC's Southern
    Alberta chapter, Alberta College of Art and Design alumni, and local members of
    Alberta Craft Council are currently being polled as part of a survey (presumably
    paid for by ACAD, since that was the focus of the questions) to look at educational
    and employment opportunities for people involved in \"art, craft, and/or design\"
    -- given the scope and type of queries, they didn't seem terribly applicable to
    folks who are strictly GDs...."

  body: "I too have toyed with the idea of becoming part of the GDC chapter here in
    British Columbia on several occaisons, but have been unimpressed with what they
    have to offer for their inflated fee. \r\n\r\nI truly believe our industry has
    a great deal to offer, but lacks the vision (in some circles) to effect change,
    make a difference and put standards in place to influence and educate the business
    industry. I have been to several guest series lectures, as well as other events,
    and while these were helpful, did not leave me more inspired.\r\n\r\nAny experienced
    designer in this industry will know that it can be a daily challenge to inform,
    educate, convince and foster good design for our clients, and our professional
    networking group should really focus on the weaknesses at hand, as well as promote
    the exciting and new artists within our field.\r\n\r\nToo often these events are
    not as open as they need to be, due to the competitive nature of our industry,
    or the environment to where we practise (too small or too large)....\r\n\r\nSo,
    I would say NO, these chapters are not overly helpful. As one who knows former
    GDC presidents personally, etc. and have seen the new 2010 Olympic logo being
    awarded to a designer like the country fair, we have a great deal more work to
    accomplish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
