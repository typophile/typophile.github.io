    don't give a hoot. They know CHKN ain't fish : )\r\n\r\nDon't ya just love the
    pink and green.\r\n\r\nI have a friend that when I stop by his place he asks me
    to do a small sign or two. I learned the first time he said\"make it more funky\"
    not to take my lettering skills to seriously.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: I like the evolution of "Pop" from top to bottom. The solid ring becomes these
    contained explosions, puckered 'P' counters, an exclusive loopy-fill, overlapping
    letters...

    amusing nonetheless. Carry on."

    depends how we define \"typography\". There's some great material in:\r\n\r\n[[http://nscad.ca/en/home/academicprograms/design/faculty/hanno_ehses.aspx|Ehses,
    H.]] (1976). <em>Design Papers 1. Semiotic Foundation of Typography</em>. NSCAD
    University. Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.\r\n\r\nLast I looked, [[http://www.elupton.com/index.php?s=about|Lupton's]]
    latest definition was:\r\n\r\n\"Typography is what language looks like.\""

    yes, I suppose so. Call me a traditionalist. Lupton's sounds more like a quip

    </em>\r\n\r\nMost graphic designers don't have to try very hard, once they put
    down their mouse and pick up a pen or brush.\r\n\r\nAlso, even if you are adept
    at drawing/writing on a small format -- mostly wrist -- things don't come out
    nearly so nice on a larger canvas once the arm comes into play. The slick boys
    there wield spray bombs.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, my local coffee shop has some
    sweet chalkboard menus, courtesy of a nearby tattooist."

    really love it. He put so much effort only for one sentence. For those who don't
    read Croatian language it says that he is offering to repair stoves and washing
    machines. But it's the numbers I love the best! Hope you guys like it. http://typophile.com/files/1347221866939.jpg
