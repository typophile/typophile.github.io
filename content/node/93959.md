body: "often have i read that the color of red has been the only available color in
  \"the old days\" to distinct an element from the rest of the black typography. so
  red is often called the \"color of typography\".\r\n\r\nbut why is that? does somebody
  know any source that explains the reason behind this? i assume that color was something
  rare then, and probably red was easier (?) to produce, but why? does anybody know
  how red color was produced during the times of gutenberg or why it was often chosen
  as the only color next to black?\r\n\r\nthanks a lot in advance. \r\n"

    also why barns were red (at least here in Norway). They still are because of tradition."
