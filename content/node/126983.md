  is on the side of the Marylebone Fire Station, which is located on Chiltern Street
  (in London, UK).\r\n\r\nThe building itself was built in 1889 but I doubt the lettering
  on the side dates from then.\r\n\r\nMore information about the building can be found
  here:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiltern_Firehouse\r\n\r\nAny help getting
  an ID (or anything similar) would be appreciated."
