    but it is very solid and the small caps work really nice!\r\ngood work!"

  body: "It's very distinctive. I'm getting an Emigre vibe from some of it. I don't
    get the straight /J/. If you cut the serif off the right side, sure, but... It
    that a regional convention somewhere? I think the /j/ works alright, though it's
    still a bit strange.\r\n\r\nThe color seems consistent, except that /M/N/W/ appear
    a little bit heavy in text (just assuming on the W since I couldn't find any in
    the test paragraphs.\r\n\r\nI find double /f/s to be distracting in text (on page
    4, my eye is drawn straight to \"souffle\" and \"effet\"). Maybe you should make
    it a ligature with one of them on the baseline. Having single /f/s go to the descender
    line is fine.\r\n\r\nThe last little thing I see is that /%/ looks light.\r\n\r\nIt
    looks great though, overall. I could definitely see using it."

  body: "Thanks Andrej and Tristan! Nice to get positive feedback!\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    not to everybody's taste, but hey, you can't please them all!\r\n\r\nThere's no
    convention on /J/, it's just me ;-) Although it sticks out, it sticks out if you
    know what I mean. Not sure I want to change that.\r\nI'll take another look at
    /M/N/V/W/, lighten them up a bit (and put them in some text).\r\nI'll also make
    a ligture for ff, I've already got some ideas. /%/ and other less used glyphs
    like it need some more attention anyway.\r\n\r\nThanks again, I'll update soon."

  body: Mmmmyeah. I don't know that the /J/ "sticks out" so much as masquerades as
    another glyph.

  body: you can say, it is you, but you also can say that /J/ sticks out just so much,
    that the majority of people might not buy/use the typeface just because of that.

    is meant to be a display typeface, why show it at such small text sizes?  Show
    how it would really shine - magazines, headlines, logotypes, whatever you think."
