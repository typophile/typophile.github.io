  body: "Sorry to break up the conversation and speculation but the typeface you may
    be looking for would named Palana...there is some confusion as to whom the true
    owner would be either Robert Trogman(who happens to be a member of this site)
    for Fotostar (that closed in 1985) or LetraSet who released it under the authorship
    of Alan Withers...either way the font's name is Palana...hope this helps\r\n\r\nHere's
    a link to where you will find it...\r\n[[http://type.akofa.com/junkdrawer/palanasample.jpg]]\r\n\r\nThanks
    from the friendly folks at [[http://type.akofa.com|AKOFAType]]"

  body: "Well spotted about Romic, Lex! It is Palana, I designed it for letraset back
    in 1980 and the guy who designed Romic,(Colin Brignall)and head of the fontstudio
    Alan Meeks oversaw the hand cutting, hence the similar styling. Don't know how
    Robert Trogman gets in on the act, nothing to do with the design side anyway!
    Regards Alan Withers\r\np.s hi to the friendly guys at akofatype...the junkdrawer??"
