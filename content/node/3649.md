    Normetica</a>! I had a hunch it&#39;d be from the Lineto collection. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 420 Swiss francs?! That&#39;s US$ 330 for just three weights. <BR>I knew Lineto
    was rather expensive, but... phew.

  body: Is that a method of making sure the typeface doesn&#39;t become overused,
    or is it just a method of being greedy?

  body: Thanks Yves, Lineto slipped my mind. <BR> <BR>Chesh - I would say it&#39;s
    just about seeking &#34;high-end&#34; clients. <BR>The Lineto stuff still sells,
    because we see it in use, so it must. <BR>But it&#39;s true that we don&#39;t
    see a lot - so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s great <BR>for their bottom line. Maybe
    they just care more about seeing <BR>it used well then making money. Dunno.

  body: That&#39;s exactly what Gerard Unger and Jeremy Tankard  <BR>once explained
    to me &#40;on separate occasions&#41;. Also,  <BR>people will think twice before
    passing those high-end  <BR>faces to friends or colleagues.
