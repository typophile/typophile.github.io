  body: "It looks like a synthesis of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/firmin-didot/|Firmin
    Didot]] and my own Marquet Titling (below), based on the 19th century work of
    Th\xE9ophile Beaudoire. Anyway, it's very French! Almost looks like it could be
    a display version of Sabon, if there were such a thing.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/marquet_6477.gif]"

    Titling</a> and the '7' like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/carter_cone/big_caslon_cc/?sample_text=MD70&sample_size=96">Big
