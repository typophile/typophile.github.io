  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We have a significant service coming up at the (Church of England) church I go to in London&ndash;the Bishop is coming to dedicate a newly painted icon. It is a black madonna, given in memory of a 16 year old victim of a shooting. I think it warrants special thought about the design of the service book, and I am considering getting a new typeface specifically for it. <BR> <BR>The core requirements are: <BR> <BR>(1) Economical, especially in horizontal space consumption. Because prayers are set like verse, one wants to avoid turnover lines, and a slightly condensed type does that. <BR> <BR>(2) A good legible bold because prayers the congregation says are set in bold. It needs to be easily distinguishable from the normal weight, but also easy to read. <BR> <BR>(3) A self-effacing italic, because italic is used for rubrics which are not particularly important. <BR> <BR>(4) A low cap-height because prayers are full of capital letters scattered mid-sentence (God, Jesus Christ, Holy Spirit, Father, Son, Lord etc &hellip;) and one wants to minimize the ugliness. <BR> <BR>(5) A good plain text face &ndash; nothing sentimental or churchy in either the Victorian (Ye Gothicke) or modern (sentimental calligraphic) veins. <BR> <BR>I saw Arnhem in Kinross's Unjustified Texts, and thought that it might work. But it's expensive enough that I don't want to make a mistake. Does anyone have any experience of using it? Would it fit the bill. <BR> <BR>(PS: The CofE itself used to use Palatino, and currently uses Gill Sans. I have used both Ehrhardt and Galliard in the past. Orthodoxy for home-produced services is either Arial (they think it's Gill) or Comic Sans (cos it's &quot;friendly&quot;, of course), but I'm a heretic.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for both answers. I don't know Print. Anything reasonably accessible set in it? (I am terrible at judging what type will look like when set just from samples.) <BR> <BR>Minion is I agree an obvious choice; I have it, which is a bonus. I also have a probably unjustified prejudice against it (perhaps because one sees so much of it about), but I suppose I should probably overcome that, and at 10pt it does look nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the suggestion. I don't believe Print was on my radar screen at all, and it's rather admirable (I'm going on the PDFs; I should check out Print itself&ndash;presumably St Bride's, which I work very close to but have never visited, would have it). To my eye it teeters on the edge of being too condensed (I suppose I mean, it is on the edge of actually appearing condensed). But I suppose &quot;teetering on the brink&quot; successfully is a fair hallmark of good design, and it certainly looks promising. <BR> <BR>BTW, I do wish it was easier to find raw data about things like cap-height, copyfitting etc &ndash; the sort of thing you get in older books on book design. I know the figures don't tell the whole story, but they do tell quite an interesting story, and it would be very useful when looking at a sample to be given them.</div>
