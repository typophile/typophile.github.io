      Swash, but do you know of the actual typeface used for both covers?

  body: "Until the 16th Century, most Roman type used in England was manufactured
    in the Netherlands. English printers were beginning to make their own Roman type
    in Shakespeare's time, but they were still using Dutch type as their model. (In
    the 17th Century, England enacted laws severely restricting the press, which sent
    English printing into a temporary decline.)\r\n\r\n[[http://myfonts.us/td-Sx7pBj|1669
    Elzevir]] is a modern re-creation of the type that inspired the early printers
    of Shakespeare. \r\n"

  body: "It is very interesting to learn of the typefaces of Pierre Haultain. So this
    face dates from 1570, and while one revival was done, it was not made generally
    available.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, as it does very strongly resemble Caslon, and
    it was formerly thought to be a typeface of Dutch origin instead of French, I'm
    wondering if the discovery of the font's origins will have an impact not just
    on Shakespearian study, but on the history of type in general - in that Caslon
    resembles this more than, say, Plantin."

  body: "Shakespeare's First Folio is well before Caslon, as as people have noted.
    Yet as Caslon was using models from the previous century, and giving his personal
    interpretation, they retain quite a bit of the feeling of the earlier types. \r\n\r\nIn
    2011 the Folger Shakespeare Library did an exhibition on Shakespeare's First Folio,
    and did a book, <em>Folio Mania! Stories Behind Shakespeare's Most Important Book</em>.
    Bruce Kennett designed the book to the same proportions and some of the same layout
    as the First Folio, and used Williams Caslon Text (Font Bureau) for the text and
    running heads, which like the First Folio were in italic with swash caps. The
    book also used fine Vellum paper. I was delighted see my typeface used so beautifully\u2014Thanks
    Bruce! I thought it succeeded pretty well in getting the feel of the old book,
    without being fake antiquarian.\r\n\r\n   [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FoliomaniaCataloguePagespread_5395.jpg]"

    for a close match to the \"First Folio\" -- which may not be essential for the
    request for a font that  screams \"Shakespeare!\" I agree Williams Caslon Text
    would work for most readers, particularly since it has a fair assortment of swashes
    and other characters that are lacking in the fonts closer to the \"First Folio.\"
