    notably Magneto and Raceway. This seems almost like a blend of them, but I thought
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/raceway/|Raceway]] was closer. Nick
    Curtis's Lakeshore Drive is also this style, but not slanted. There are a number
    of others in this genre shown in Part 7 of my Script Font ID Guide, but I didn't
    see an exact match. Maybe someone else recognizes it?\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    into a sign. Lovely. Is it an old sign? It actually looks fairly new. '
