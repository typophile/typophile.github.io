  very familiar but I can\u2019t pin it down. It is the masthead from the <a href=\"http://www.pv-magazine.com\">pv
  magazine</a>. So possibly it is custom, but the \xBBe\xAB, \xBBa\xAB and the \xBBg\xAB
  look very familiar to me, but I have no clue. Just found similars. \r\n\r\nAnother
  thing which let me think it could be custom, is that in all the PDFs (at least those
  I have seen) they use the masthead inside their copy texts only as embedded picture.
  \r\n\r\nAnyway, I\u2019ll want to give it a try here. \r\n\r\nFYI: It\u2019s from
  a request from a german type-ID site. I am interested in the typeface (if it is
  one), because it looks clean, contemporary and useful. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance. "
