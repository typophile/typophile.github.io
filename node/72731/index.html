  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've just designed my first font (after being a long time lurker...) and I've seriously caught the type bug! I've started initial ideas on 3 other faces since the completion of tracing my first font, Leena. 

However after designing it, scaling it fully in illustrator (descenders and ascenders) I've come to a dead end with Fontographer. I'm using 5 (and have limited time on it... I have to travel to uni to use it every time I attempt it) and can't figure out how to set the x height... my lower case a is the same height as a capital H and I can't figure out how to adjust this...

Also, the initial version of the font are multi-tonal which Fontographer seems to chew out as a solid b/w shape. The type is still legible in this format, but takes away from the look and feel (and even the concept) of the typeface in a solid monotone shape. 

An example of the type multi-tonal approach I want can be found here - http://www.typographyserved.com/Gallery/Time-Type/568156

Is this simply a matter of creating the font as symbols in illustrator as apposed to composing them as a font file?

Any and all help will be appreciated. Looking forward to contributing to these forums :)</div>

Then, find a reference point for your baseline. Zoom in and click the "Guides" checkbox. Drag a guideline to the baseline and make a note of its vertical position. Under FONT INFO, Dimensions, enter this number as your Descender, then subtract that number from 1000 to get your Ascender. Then select all of your glyphs and MOVE them DOWN this same value. Then RESET YOUR BASEPOINTS to 0,0.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As far as the multi-tonal aspect is concerned, most modern font formats only support pure black and white. I'm pretty sure Type 3 was the last format to support grayscale values and most modern software won't be compatible with Type 3 fonts.

What you might want to try is making a different font file for each color you want. Then you can layer them and change the fill as you see fit. A lot of type designers use this technique for drop shadowed, 3d, or pattern filled fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I'm with you on what I should be doing, I can see a layers option for guides, by nothing else. I copy/pasted the font straight from illustrator a character at a time, should I have imported the whole document with guides etc. and selected them this way? (Completely new to FOG)

I guessed as much Andrevv, if I'm being honest, I don't even know what I was expecting. I just dropped in the vectors after two weeks of tweaks and realized that as much as I'd thought through everything else about the font, I hadn't thought about the tonal aspect. The multiple fonts is a very nice idea, especially for practicality. I'm going to have to get my head around Fontographer first though...

Nevermind, just have to knuckle down and get some tutorials done... Got to many ideas at the moment to let software limit me :)</div>

I export five to seven characters at a time from CorelDraw to EPS, then import into FOG, do a clean-up to add extrema and closepaths (but not to simplify outlines), correct the parth direction, remove overlaps, then cut and paste into adjacent cells.

By selected the GUIDES checkbox, you can drag guides from the baseline to any position you want, and the curs0r info at the top of the glyph window will tell you where you are...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is one <em>caveat</em> about using this import method in FontLab: for some reason, if your spacing marks are not part of a solid figure, FontLab imports the EPS at less than full em-square height (the top image in the screengrabs below). A solid full em-height figure, such as the bar glyph in the bottom grab) <em>does</em> import full height...

So, if you want to maintain consistent dimensions throughout your importing, for FL you need to use one method or the other, but not both...</div>
