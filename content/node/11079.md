  team. Its inspired by &#34;Aachen&#34;, &#34;Princeton&#34; and &#34;City BQ&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>Now I totally redesign the font and add many features like:  <BR> <BR>Ligatures
  <BR>Alternates <BR>Small Caps <BR>Old Style Numerals <BR> <BR>The hardest thing
  is to kern this font. So Opentype is the only format to handle this massive kerning
  tables. InDesigns &#34;autokerning&#34; engine - cant handle these faces in a good
  way - so I have to do all by hand. <BR> <BR>Is is the first face &#34;ThunderBold&#34;

  body: ' I think this is a great idea, and well executed - it just needs polish &#40;and
    I don&#39;t mean ogoneks&#41;, and of course that tricky OpenType stuff &#40;which
    I agree is central to your idea&#41;. <BR> <BR>In terms of letterforms, the lc
    is the hardest part... more soon. <BR> <BR>&#40;BTW, maybe put this under &#34;Display&#34;,
    no?&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp '

    Topic has more experimental fonts than &#34;seriously&#34; ones. :-&#41; ...and
    the Crayfish is a serifed font. '

  body: ' I really love how the letters fit together -- when they do. For instance,
    the D and the I, the O and the P. They nestle together so well. But in other instances
    they clash: the C and the D. <BR> <BR>I wonder if there would be a way to either
    make them always fit or never fit. Having the letters SOMETIMES fit is very distracting
    for me. '

    <BR>This is &#42;exactly&#42; the problem with making a tightly-spaced bitmap
    font, and the impetus behind spawning Verdana out of Tahoma. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Hello Glutton, <BR> <BR>thanx for the comment - I have done a rekerning
    of font. But I think &#34;CD&#34; fits very well - like a logo - but of course,
    C produces a lot of white space. But C is also an essential character for this
    font - a &#34;face letter&#34;. So it`s is more a question of personal taste I
    think. <BR> <BR>/attach '
