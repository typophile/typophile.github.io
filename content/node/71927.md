  way to Karen Cheng's Designing Type? I'm looking for a book that at least shows
  axial stresses, relative proportions, and some width measurements to compare. Haven't
  had any luck in finding even something close to this, and feel like it'd be really
  helpful. (hopefully the information isn't in some out of print volume\u2026)"

    them over one another, both within and between fonts. Use the guidelines and measuring
    meter to find slants and weights. All the secrets are in plain sight\u2014not
    that that makes it easy. \r\n\r\nAlso have a look at the \"How to\" section in
    the Typowiki. Enjoy!"

    and proportions for yourself, but many metal-era specimen books, especially from
    type houses (as opposed to founders) have copy-fitting charts, showing characters
    per em.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you can track down a good \"jobbing\" typesetter's
    specimen from the 1950s, it will show types from many foundries."

  body: Thanks! Not quite what I'm looking for all in one easy place, but definitely
    helpful. I'll try checking those out.
