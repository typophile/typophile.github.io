  telecommunications cable; however, that was laid in 1858. And the \uFB01rst Transatlantic
  telephone cable was laid in the 1950s. So which cable was laid in \u201927? From
  the Siemens web site:\r\n<blockquote>Facsimile telegraphy was introduced in the
  nineteen twenties. Photographs were scanned by a photocell and copied onto photosensitive
  paper by means of a controlled light source at the receiving end. In 1927, the Berlin-Vienna
  route went into operation using the Siemens-Karolus-Telefunken system. This new
  way of transmitting photographs was used in particular by the press.</blockquote>"

  body: "Wikipedia claimed that it was named after the first trans-Atlantic telephone
    cable. However, a quick Google shows that that cable was laid in 1956, so you
    are indeed far more likely to be correct than they.\r\n\r\nEDIT: And it becomes
    curiouser.\r\n\r\nI thought I should Google some more, in case there was a trans-Atlantic
    telephone cable laid in 1927 that failed after a short period, so that the 1956
    one was the first one that was practical.\r\n\r\nWhat I found instead was that
    trans-Atlantic telephone <em>service</em> began in 1927, that service was based
    on radio links, and the first trans-Atlantic telephone <em>cable</em> indeed was
    laid in 1956.\r\n\r\nSo the coincidence of dates seems to have led to the misconception
    about Kabel which you have cleared up.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I have found some further
    evidence, however, which suggests that Kabel <em>could</em> have been named after
    a trans-Atlantic telephone cable, albeit one that was never successfully completed.\r\n\r\nThe
    discovery of inductive loading of cables, known then as \"Pupinization\", led
    to discussions of building a trans-Atlantic telephone cable in the 1920s, since
    this reduced signal distortion to a point which seemed to make such a cable possible,
    given sufficient amplification at both ends.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made to lay
    such a cable, but it ended in failure in the early 1930s, due to the Great Depression
    - according to Wikipedia, but I have not been able to find, at least on the Web,
    other references, by means of which I could determine who made the attempt, and
    whether it failed while attempting to raise capital, or if any actual cable was
    set down on the sea floor.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I finally did locate [[http://www.iscpc.org/information/Timeline_History.htm|a
    reference]], which notes that design of a trans-Atlantic telephone cable which
    was continuously loaded using Permavar tape began in 1928, with the cable being
    manufactured in Germany. The cable would have run between New York and Ireland,
    as a joint project of AT&T and the British Post Office, and the project did fail
    due to the Depression.\r\n\r\nThis unsuccessful attempt, however, would then have
    begun one year too late to have formed the inspiration for the name of Kabel."

  body: "Telecommunications is an interest of designers, of course, as we are communicators,
    and technological change  has a constant impact on our work.\r\n\r\nRound about
    the time of Kabel, technophile Moholy-Nagy exhibited his telephone paintings,
    which he had ordered by phone, describing the size and position of abstraqct shapes,
    and their colors by the pantone system of the day.\r\n\r\nIt has always impressed
    me how <em>au fait</em> Koch was with modernism, given his deep grasp of traditional
    media. However, during the \u2019twenties many artists who had been heavily into
    historicism when it was the thing changed horses and became modernists. It\u2019s
    not such a big deal for designers (if we don\u2019t become trapped in our brand),
    as force of necessity makes us familiar with working in different styles and methods,
    for different clients. "

  body: "Perhaps the name is more metaphorical, in a plastic sense: making the equation
    between cabel as wire/cord, and a monolinear typeform of similar appearance, strength
    and integrity.\r\n\r\nBut now take it a step further than cable-like form, and
    consider the typeface\u2019s cable-like function (font as a medium of communication,
    suitably high-tech).\r\n\r\nIt is a typeface that looks like a cable, and self-referentially
    refers to itself as a means of communication. The name is a pun.\r\n\r\nThe references
    to speci\uFB01c communications cables may not be literal, but they set the tone."

  body: Cables were a fascinating thing in those days, obviously, when you think of
    the famous catalogue made by Piet Zwart for a cable company. Though I think Koch
    might have called Kabel Kabel because of the geometric shape?

    the Zugspitze (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugspitze). The first one was built
