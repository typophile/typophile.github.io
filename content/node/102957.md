  wanted to say thanks to Mark Simonson for his help with some technical questions
  with regarding to encoding, naming, etc. And a big thank you to Maximiliano Sproviero
  for letting me bounce glyph looks off of him, and for his fantastic suggestions
  for making the font. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nRL"

    easy to achieve with so many scripts in the marketplace today.\r\nBut you did
    it. Wishing you all the best... good luck!\r\nAnd, keep it up. I expect to see
    more great stuff from you.\r\n"
