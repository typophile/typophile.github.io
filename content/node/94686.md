  numbered raffle tickets and etc.\r\nHaving a bit of trouble picking which font I
  should use for this.  It needs to be official looking and yet somehow hand stamped.

  body: "Listen to Kent: that IS the right tool for the job.\r\n\r\nAs is Print Merging:
    an excellent thing to know how to do when certain kinds of jobs need to be done.
    Once you get clued into how it works, you can find a lot of other uses for it.
    And, if you are the go-to guy for it\u2014as I was in my last job\u2014you become
    a valuable member of the team. Which means your job is a bit more secure that
    it might otherwise be. Which, given the still alarmingly high unemployment rate,
    is encouraging.\r\n\r\nStudy it well, Grasshopper."
