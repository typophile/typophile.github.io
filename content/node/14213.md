  moderator. In addition to his good nature, Paul has shown an uncanny dedication
  to the [[start|Typowiki]]. Like other moderators, Paul will traverse the halls here,
  but will focus his efforts on the wiki.\r\n\r\nPaul's favorite quote of the moment:
  \"Keep our wiki clean.\" Paul is currently working with [[P22]] in Rochester, NY.\r\n\r\nWelcome
  Paul!"

  body: i don't think we met at typecon, chris; i'm sure i woulda remembered. if there's
    anyone who i didn't say hey to it IS because i'm shy (at least at first). i'm
    sorry i didn't get around to meeting everyone that was there.
