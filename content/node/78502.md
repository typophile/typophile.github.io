  body: "I started out creating an opentype font and when I tried to convert it, it
    crashed fontlab 4.5. \r\n\r\nI think I need to try converting instructions and
    curves and maybe also hints, to truetype first, and there's a couple of other
    ideas I have gotten recently. I will eventually really try to figure it out, and
    if I figure it out I will post it, but I don't really care anymore if I do create
    a truetype or not - I think I will just make opentype fonts.\r\n\r\nYeah I plan
    to upgrade fontlab ASAP.\r\n\r\nTHANX"
