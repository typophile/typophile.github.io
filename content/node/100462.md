  of the font used for the number bullets in this great book designed by Kasper-Florio?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kasper-Florio_Begegnungen_20_2048_6212.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  this picture it is the font of \"[S.105] GERTRUDE STEIN\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kasper-Florio_Begegnungen_16_2048_5983.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  help is really appreciated.\r\n\r\nSeb"

  body: "Jan, although I really appreciate you identifying the main font in use within
    these images. Please read my comment a bit more. I'm trying to find the font used
    for the number bullets in the first image, and \"[S.105] GERTRUDE STEIN\" in the
    second. \r\n\r\nNext time I'll do a better job of cropping my images, so its not
    so confusing, sorry.\r\n\r\nSeb"

    as very similar.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!"
