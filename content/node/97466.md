  to the Johnson & Johnson logo, but not quite. Maybe the same artist did it? It might
  be custom for both cases, in which case the question should be what is a script
  that would get me there?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rare-vintage-american-white-cross-bandage-tin-can-first-aid-kit-band-aids_250898475887_4269.jpg]"

  body: Can't even say if it's actually a font or not but it makes me thinking somehow
    to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/alphabetsoup/metroscript/|Metroscript]]. Having
    a look to the [[http://www.myfonts.com/morelike/76095/|"More Fonts like..."]]
    could worth a shot...

    body: "Thanks for the suggestion Ryuk \u2013 Metroscript is pretty close, but
      it doesn't have the same kind of thicks and thins that the original has. I'll
      give it a shot though!\r\n\r\nI've also been looking at [[http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Mr-Sheffield-UMT0000111?skeywords=script|Mr
      Sheffield]] and  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suomi/cider/script/|Cider Script]],
      but nothing has quite that mix of medical seriousness and vintage charm. Might
      just be too hand-done to match the mood perfectly!"
