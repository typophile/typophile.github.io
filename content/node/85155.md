body: "Hi, I'm new to typophile, and I have a typeface to choose. I have a small,
  light-hearted self-help book project, based on Victorian health tips. I'm using
  \"Jugend WF\" (sample attached) for the titling and heads, but I'm trying to find
  a good body face for the content.\r\n\r\nI'm overrun display faces from Victorian
  advertising and posters but I don't really know where to start for a respectful
  hardworking body face. I can't decide whether it needs a sans with a nod to the
  Victorian era to contrast and root it in the present, or a serif from the Victorian
  era to respect the context. I'm leaning towards a serif, but I don't want it to
  look too dry.\r\n\r\nPlease help! "

  body: "A scotch looks like the job. A sans might end up too jarring, and jokey.
    It still needs to be taken seriously, and a scotch roman certainly would.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    if there's a scotch and a sans which work well as a pair?"
