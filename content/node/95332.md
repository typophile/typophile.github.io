  fonts from OTF (cff) files? I'm on OSX and it could be command line tools as well.\r\nI
  know there are more than a few sites available that can do it for you, but I'm looking
  at fonts that I'd like to convert myself and also test with OT features.\r\n\r\nI've
  looked at sfntly from Google but it's still a work in progress and also does not
  handle OTF/CFF fonts.\r\nThere's an (old) tool from JKew (http://people.mozilla.org/~jkew/woff/)
  but could not test it yet (the pre-compiled version doesn't run atm).\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas or pointers?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRolf"

      time (back in March) Brian (from the project) wrote: <em>"[...] Currently sfntly
      can recognize the CFF table block but cannot take the CFF table apart or reassemble
      it; ie: cannot edit or subset it. We also want to subset OTF/CFF fonts so we
      are working on adding subsetting support for CFF but it''s a biggish task and
      will take a while (several seasons)."</em> I think it can read the font, but
      that''s it really.. no real support yet.'

  body: "@Ralf H: thanks for the tips, I will check fontsquirrel again. The thing
    is that by using it I'm not sure what's going on behind the scenes. I don't know
    that either when I'm calling sfntly (well, I can check the source code), but at
    the moment I want to try it locally first anyway to see if I can generate the
    same results.\r\n\r\nAs for conversion CFF to TTF, it's indeed not my main concern
    at the moment. But I rather not convert it right away (automatically) to start
    with the basics first and then compare later. Like, I don't know if anyone seriously
    compared the fonts after applying Font Squirrel TT hinting automatically (and
    by self made conversion or whatever)\r\n"
