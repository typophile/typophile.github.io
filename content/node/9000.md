body: Maybe the build section isn&#39;t the right place to ask this but.... <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  tried almost all combinations of shift/option/command/etc and I still can&#39;t
  type the &#34;multiply&#34; and &#34;minus&#34; characters... does anybody know
  how to do it?

  body: You can&#39;t. They are not part of the standard Mac keyboard layout.  <BR>
    <BR>Most commercial fonts include them because they are part of the standard Windows
    keyboard layout. If you have OS X you can use the system Character Palette to
    input them into some &#40;most?&#41; programs. In more recent Adobe apps you can
    use the Glyph palette.

    on this, pressing minus on the keypad gives me a \u2212 &#40;U&#43;2212&#41;,
    and pressing option-asterisk on the keypad gives me a \xD7 &#40;U&#43;D7; and
    option-slash gives me a \xF7 too; U&#43;F7&#41;."
