  bits of text (newspapers I think) to create illustrations (pretty sure the ones
  I saw were portraits).\r\n\r\nI've seen their work before, but can't remember for
  the life of me their name. Really annoying as I really need their stuff for a main
  bit of research in a small university project.\r\n\r\nAnyone know who I am talking
  about?\r\n\r\nHope I have explained it well - if not let me know, and I'll try reword
  it!"
