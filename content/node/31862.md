body: "I'm looking for a square, bold, san-serifed typeface. Similar to like a bold
  trade gothic, but not as vertical.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any suggestions as to
  what will fit this description?\r\n\r\n\r\nsorry, but i have no visual (it's really
  something that i want. i know i've seen it before but i don't remember where)."

  body: FF Hydra all the way, Kenny. It has killer ink traps and comes in three widths
    -- <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11346.0.0">FF Hydra</a>
    (narrowest), <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11347.0.0">FF
    Hydra Extended</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11463.0.0">FF
    Hydra Text</a> (widest). Everyone I recommend it to falls head over heels for
    it.

    body: "thanks guys for all the input.\r\n\r\nthe FF Hydra Text is definitely looking
      sweet. i can't believe how closed the apertures are, but it's pretty much bang
      on as to what i was looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\nas always, thanks again for all
      the input and the speedy replies.\r\n\r\n\r\nand on a side note, what typeface
      is used for TYPOPHILE in the logo? is that a customized font or is it commercially
      available?"

    about the bolder weights of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Eurostile">Eurostile</a>
