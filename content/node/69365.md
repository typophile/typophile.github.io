body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Uhland_6700.jpg]\r\nI recently came across
  this delightful 1817 silhouette of Ludwig Uhland by Luise Duttenhofer. At the time,
  Dr. Uhland was 30. He was a well-known Romantic poet, and there are many portraits
  of him on the Internet, several in old age; in none of them is he wearing eyeglasses.
  Was this the style for immersing oneself in romantic poetry? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Friedrich_4690.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  this painting by Friedrich (detail) from the same era, the lady is also holding
  her book quite close. This is anecdotal, so I wonder if any studies have been done
  on what normal reading distance is for various kinds of documents. And what does
  type size have to do with this? And offset vs. letterpress?"

    more absorbed in the book. \r\n\r\nI'm sure studies have been done on reading
    distance as that info is important when making reading glasses and bifocals. \r\n\r\nRecently
    I was talking to my optometrist about my bifocals and he mentioned \"arm's length
    or slightly less\" as a typical reading distance, although when I was younger
    I typically held books a little closer than that because I was nearsighted.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Perhaps it was just a question of vision impairment? I assume that corrective
    lenses in those days were not as sophisticated as today. It also may be that vanity
    prevented some people from wearing glasses? (Particularly those who were romance
    minded)

  body: "Nice collection of images, Craig.\r\n\r\n<em>Perhaps it was just a question
    of vision impairment? </em>\r\n\r\nThat would only apply to the 20% of the population
    who are sufficiently impacted by short sightedness and stigmatism to warrant reading
    closely, and many of those would use glasses. The lenses to fix simple short/long
    sightedness are quite simple, e.g. they can be bought off the rack at chemists/drug
    stores today. So AFAIK they were readily available in the 19th century and earlier.\r\n\r\nIt
    would seem that reading distance is multivalent, related to individual physiology,
    reading position (chair/desk/standing), document scale (page/type size), text
    genre (difficulty of language), document genre (balance of text/image) and lighting
    conditions.\r\n\r\nI always liked the way Schubert rocked the wire-frame look.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/franz-schubert-and-music_6700.jpg]"

    National Galley in London, where the mediaeval and early renaissance works are
    shown, looking for depictions of people reading (or in the case of so many depictions
    of the Annuniciation, interrupted while reading). There are an extraordinary number,
    many more proportionally, I recall, than in the collection of later works.\r\n\r\nI
    hadn't thought about it much before, but realise that I tend to hold books quite
    close. On the other hand, I hold newspapers at arms' length, and have my computer
