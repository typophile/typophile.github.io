  body: "The serifs on the uppercase T in Garamond (including Adobe) are very distinctive.
    They point in the same direction, instead of being symmetrical as in Caslons.\r\n\r\nAdobe
    Caslon's W (uppercase) comes to one peak, while Garamond's looks like two overlapping
    Vs\r\n\r\nAdobe Garamond has serifs both at the top and the bottom of the  uppercase
    C while Adobe Caslon only has a top serif. However, other Caslons, such as 540,
    have both serifs.\r\n\r\nThe center bar on the E and F in Caslon don't stick out
    as far as in Garamond."
