  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Every day we are exposed to typography of all levels - rare is the treasured occasion that we find truly moving type in public. Part of me loves this fact, as the discovery and appreciation of great type is a special treat. Another part of me gets impatient that not enough people (designers and general public alike) care about good typography, which, of course, means that there are poor design choices being made regularly, and published  nonetheless!</p>
<p>Alas, my (our) obsession with type brings with it a curse: scrutiny of absolutely everything that uses letters. How many of us can read something without considering the appropriateness of the choices of typeface, proportion, kerning, leading, et cetera?</p>
<p>For better or worse, this is something we all must deal with on a day-to-day basis as typophiles. I&rsquo;m curious to know how others handle this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Ray</p>

<p>It warms my heart to hear I am not alone. It would be interesting to find that there are throngs of us. Maybe even have recitals akin to karaoke. I just wish a real money-making idea could capture my imagination like my obviously cockamamie ideas can.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;How many of us can read something without considering the [type]&rdquo;</p>
<p>A good question. I read almost everything without considering the type. It is only when I am being paid to do so, or, if there is &ldquo;something wrong&rdquo; in something I&rsquo;m obliged or attracted to reading that I do consider it. It did, however, take me no short time and it was incomplete until I&rsquo;d made a decidedly type-sparse environment. From the refrigerator to approximately 6 miles in all directions, superfluous type is rare.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there are not incredibly dense areas of type in the home/office, but they are kept at bay and hardly ever left in the right-reading position. As this is the point of view a type of a designer-with-an-outlet, it may be different from that of a non-type designing typophile — i.e. I can say to myself, &ldquo;Well that looks bad&rdquo;, when I trip over something bad from a print ad to an OS.  &ldquo;Poor thing.&rdquo; But then I can put it to rest by making sure whatever I saw wrong &ldquo;out there&rdquo; is right in the font , fonts, or composition in progress.</p>
<p>Graphic designing typophiles must get similar satisfaction each time they don&rsquo;t do something bad they remember seeing done, don’t they? If they don&rsquo;t I think they should.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

This is more of a passion, every big passion has its drawbacks&hellip; not enough of course to drop a passion like this for typography. This happens to everything you know in depth, i mean, even as a graphic designer, i see somethings and a shiver of discuss comes to me. I am a beginner on typographic design but even I catch myself analyzing everything i lay my eyes on. Grids Colors Typography Shapes.

<p>I went driving around LA with a friend on Wed. and one place we visited was USC, which surprised both of us by being one of the worst examples of uncoordinated architecture we have ever seen.</p>
<p>For such a prestigious school, it defies logic. Not to mention it is surrounded in all directions by some of the funkiest parts of LA.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Noses in the air should not be equated with the right to critical comment. If someone calls himself a professional and is paid to do typographic work, he/she takes on the likelihood of comment by their peers for better or for worse. This does not mean name-calling or personal attack but well documented critical commentary on the work presented is fair game.
As I said initially, I have no issue with a mom&amp;pop store putting up their hand made signs in their store&ndash;they are just doing the best they can. My issue is with the self-proclaimed pro who takes the money and runs amuck.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eventually (hopefully) you will outgrow an obsessiveness to scrutinize type.</p>
<p>To mature as a designer, typographer, type designer, you need to be able to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->see<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with &ldquo;fresh innocent eyes&rdquo; at will. If one always approaches a piece with clinical scrutiny, then one is not able to experience the initial expression of what that piece has to offer.</p>
<p>The same holds true with many other skilled or artistic professions; culinary arts, music, film making, etc. It is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first impression<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which should remain unique and/or memorable, not the minutia.</p>
<p>It is the minutia that enhances the overall experience, but you can&rsquo;t receive that experience by focusing on the minutia. Sort of like not seeing the forest because the trees are in your way.</p>
<p>Train yourself to see without <!-- raw HTML omitted -->typographic eyes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at will, since there will always be time for nit-picking afterwards.</p>
