  serif serif with small swashes in the red backgroud. I tried WhatTheFont but failed.
  I guess it's a customized typeface. Any thoughts? Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/xt_4591.jpg]\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJZ"

  body: "This is a mystery to me. There are relatively few serif fonts with Roman
    swashes (most swashes are italics), and this doesn't seem to be from any of the
    fonts that I have catalogued. I was hoping that maybe Underware or Emigre had
    a font with a Roman swash, but I didn't see anything close.\r\n\r\nI'll be curious
    about the answer to this one. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    the wacky swashes. Now, Flxb seems right, at least the way I see it.\r\n\r\nJZ"

    actually refers to the architecture of the character shapes, more than to the
    actual slant."
