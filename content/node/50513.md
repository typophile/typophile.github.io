  saved from the throws of destruction this fall). Basically it entails each person
  individually writing a personal for a letter in the alphabet, such as:\r\n\r\nLetter
  B seeking typographically compatible companion. A, E, I, O, U, but not Y. Okay with
  heavier weight. Good kerning a must.\r\n\r\nJust a rough example, but you get the
  idea. I have the letter S and haven't come up with anything good, so I was wondering
  if anyone had any sort of ideas. Raunchy and inappropriate are fine."

    with sexual and gender overtones springs to mind, but I'm not going to tell you
    what it is.\r\n\r\nMaybe if you open up a Thesaurus at the Individual Volition

  body: Not asking you to think for me or do the design end. The side project is not
    even graded. Just thought some others may find it humorous and I've always found
    talking with others to be creatively helpful.
