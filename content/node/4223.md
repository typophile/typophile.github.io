  <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t picked colors yet or a typeface. I am leaning to Champion

    I would consider making the broad diagonal a bit thinner. see example. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33217.gif"

  body: I see Piano Keys as well, but in the context of lighting, it&#39;s probably
    not a big deal. I wonder if you could do it with fewer &#39;rays&#39; just to
    make the mark a bit more flexible in size. Also, maybe try one where the thicker
    parts of the rays are &#39;hanging&#39; from the ray insteald of centered on the
    ray &#40;does that make sense&#41;. <BR> <BR>And, I hate to say it, but the original
    card is so bad that it&#39;s good. ;o&#41;

  body: tom -- the first one looks like the old logo, sorta, is that wavy? if it is
    wavy, then no, that isn&#39;t it at all. the dot version is newer. the old logo
    had a varying amount of prongs depending upon the size it was to be used at.

  body: Tom -- Better use of white and black. I can see rays of light now. But, how
    does it work at smaller sizes? And, how will you incorporate color? Or is it a
    one-color logo. I know the old adage &#34;must work good in black and white&#34;,
    but I&#39;d like to see how you plan on solving that problem. But first, size.

  body: Good questions Tiffany. Below are the logos at smaller sizes. They won&#39;t
    need to be any smaller than what I have them at. I don&#39;t want to take too
    many rays out because I like the gradual increase in the shapes of the tail of
    the &#34;k&#34;. Let me know if you think it looses too much, but I don&#39;t
    feel it does. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33314.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>As far as color I will tackle that next. Like you said I do b&amp;w
    first before color. I will probably do the icon in 1 color, unless I find it looks
    better otherwise. I will probably do the text in anoher color.

  body: Tom, I like the image you&#39;re going for quite a bit, but I think the K
    needs to be sturdier. The righthand leg feels too flared, or perhaps too tapered
    at the top. The thinning of the upper diagonal is better in the second version,
    but I still think the flaring of the leg is too strong. Also, the lefthand leg
    is getting eaten away by the negative space of the rays, but I&#39;m not sure
    that&#39;s as much of a problem. Adjusting these might help for smaller sizes,
    though &#40;which will cause problems at all of those joins&#41;. I guess I&#39;d
    recommend being freer with the manipulation of the original letterform. <BR> <BR>Are
    you still considering Champion Gothic Bantamweight? <BR> <BR>Also, I prefer the
    earlier versions, in spite of the piano interpretations. I actual saw a clock
    hand/ metranome moving at first glance. I like the concept a lot. I&#39;m eager
    to see where it goes.

  body: Hi Tom, <BR> <BR>I guess you want the rays effect to expand the &#34;lighting/radiant&#34;
    concept? I like it but I think the logo looks a bit &#34;oldie&#34; as an 80&#39;s
    corporate logo &#40;can&#39;t think on a more correct word, sorry&#41;. I know
    there will be type and more info on it and this can change how I&#39;m looking
    to it now. I&#39;ve looked on an old logo book &#40;from &#39;91 DAVID E. CARTER,
    logos of America&#39;s fastest growing corporations&#41; and found some examples
    you can see for inspiration. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33398.gif"

  body: I&#39;ll have to admit over-using the linear halftoning effect during the
    late 80s and early 90s myself, and for that reason I haven&#39;t found myself
    going there anymore, but I wouldn&#39;t steer Tom away from experimenting with
    the technique. I think exploring as many techniques as possible for value gradation
    is essential to any designer&#39;s education. This is a great collection of samples
    Adriano. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not quite feelin&#39; the logo yet, Tom. Fortunately
    for you, I don&#39;t have to. I think I&#39;m on a similar page to Ryan&#39;s.
    I&#39;m not crazy about the flaring of the leg and upper arm/stroke &#40;optical&#41;.
    I kind of like the light rays starting inside the base of the stem, but I wonder
    if they angled, causing a slight flare to the base of the stem, if it would offer
    more stability. Maybe even start the top ray by completely separating the base
    of the stem by following the upper arm/stroke through the stem. Have you tried
    stopping the rays at the outer edge of the leg? <BR> <BR>Just some thoughts. <BR>
    <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: 'I think you should bolster the lower-left leg &#40;spine&#41;, perhaps having
    the vertex of the rays farther to the right. Obviously, the optical perception
    of the vertex will vary with print size and technique, but right now that part
    looks too thin IMO. <BR> <BR>What about alternating an extra-long &#40;beyond
    the square shape&#41; ray and a shorter one to add some visual interest to that
    side? <BR> <BR>Also, about the &#34;80s look&#34;: Most of the companies that
    used a linear halftone logo were telecommunications &#40;AT&amp;T&#41; or high-tech,
    like the ones Adriano posted. Since Kentucky Lights is actually a lighting supplier,
    your use of rays in the logo is representative of their business rather than a
    trendy design feature. <BR> <BR>Make sure the new business cards spell &#34;commercial&#34;

  body: I will make the changes you all suggested &#40;unflairing the k, enlarging
    the base, etc&#41; and post them. I like your idea of separating the bottom with
    the top, Scott. <BR> <BR>I feel that my logo doesn&#39;t fit in with that group
    of logos posted &#40;as Chase said above&#41; because it is symbolizing light
    which is relative to the company. Light will probably always be symbolized by
    bursts and rays. Customers immediately &#40;if done right&#41; should think light.
    However, I agree that the halftoning in most of the above logos looks outdated.

  body: 'I find the first versions you posted best, Tom. They are the only ones communicating
    &#34;light&#34; at two different cogitive levels. The first level is visual description:
    rays. The second one is a subtle presentation of light by thin white spaces &#40;between
    rays&#41; which actually &#34;shine&#34; somewhere from behind the K logo. The
    thick parts, which are sitting on the rays then make little geometrical shadows.
    <BR> <BR>That first logos make the viewer FEEL the light. <BR> <BR>I am afraid
    this second layer of meaning has been spoiled in later versions. The reason might
    be in fact that you have turned those shadows into some kind of wall. This wall
    can even be understood as a device for stopping the light. You don&#39;t want
    that, do you? <BR> <BR>In case you agree with my advice, then maybe you will have
    to balance those thick parts of the K and white spaces a bit more carefully.'
