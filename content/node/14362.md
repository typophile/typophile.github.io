body: "I'm looking for the font most often used in the 70\u2019s style high fashion
  magazines (such as harpers bazaar) where numbers were a focal point and small text
  accompanied the numbers, underneath them, and below a rule. (It might be Herb Lubalin?)
  This is the closest I could find, and I'm having the worst trouble identifying it.
  Can you help? Thanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sahara Bodoni is close but no cigar -- the upper loop on the ampersand doesn't
    match, and the dollar sign in the sample has no serifs but ball terminals. I think
    we're looking at Pistilli Roman, which matches the time frame.\r\n\r\nDon't know
    about that other ampersand. Cabernet Swash is a digitisation of Caslon Sawsh,
    which also matches the time frame. There are minor discrepancies, but do we really
    care? ;-)"
