body: "Born in London in 1929, Mike has degrees in architecture and graphic design
  from Yale. In 1958-59 he was lucky enough to be the person who put in order the
  punches, matrices and molds at the [[Plantin Moretus Museum|Plantin Museum]]. Jackson
  Burke at [[Mergenthaler Linotype]] believed that this experience might be turned
  to account preparing type libraries for photocomposition machines. Inheriting the
  design staff originally trained by [[Chauncey H. Griffith|Chauncey Griffith]], Mike
  managed the expansion of the Linotype library from a collection of 150 American
  hot metal designs for text-setting to an inclusive library of nearly 1,500 international
  digital designs for full page setting. In 1981 he left Linotype with [[Matthew Carter]]
  to found [[Bitstream]], went on to found The Company in 1987, and Pages Software
  in 1990. Pages developed a word processor on the NeXT platform which provided the
  writer with powerful graphic support.\r\n\r\nCourtesy of The Font Bureau, Inc. "
