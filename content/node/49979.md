  haven't been doing much in the way of making or using fonts lately, but I got a
  bug in my bonnet to make one this past weekend and soon recalled why this work is
  not for sissies. :)\r\n\r\nI've created a three-member family I call \"FultonSignAndPriceMarkers\".
  The members are Regular, Light and Symbols. For some reason, not all applications
  are happy with the new fonts (OTFs), as evidenced by the fact that they don't all
  show up in every application's font menus. Here is what I have found so far:\r\n\r\nExtensis
  Suitcase - no problems, all styles work\r\nAll Apple apps - works fine, all styles
  available\r\nAdobe Photoshop - works fine, all styles available\r\nAdobe InDesign
  & Illustrator - only Symbols style is present and available\r\nMS Office apps -
  light version is present but no style names show or are available\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  can help me sort this out, I'd be much obliged. For reference, I am using Mac OS
  10.411 and FontLab 5.\r\n\r\nI'd happily post the font files or any other info that
  might help.\r\n\r\nThanks mucho,\r\n\r\nAmy\r\naka\r\nl'Ab\xE9c\xE9darienne\r\n"

    before generating the font(s).\r\n\r\nSecond, because its working in some but
    not all apps, I'd suggest that you might need to run a utility to clean out your
    font caches. I use FontFinagler once a month or so, especially to \"fix\" Adobe
    menus that get all cluttered with fonts I had open two weeks prior. Adobe apps
    seem more prone to this than others, probably because they maintain their own
    font caches independent of the system... you may be seeing older versions of your
    font still cached in the apps' memories.\r\n\r\nI don't know if Font Finagler
    is Leopard-compatible, but it does work in Tiger."

    it's still not working (in the same ways as above) for the other apps.\r\n\r\nI
    named them via the FL Font Info dialog. I'm attaching screenshots here. If anyone
    spots any potential pitfalls, please let me know. \r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fultonreginfo_4518.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fultonlightinfo_4924.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fultonsymbolsinfo_5179.jpg]"

    Adobe apps generally look at other name entries, accessible on your second page.\r\nSo:\r\n\r\nFamily
    Name + Full Name unique:\r\n1. \"Fulton Sign And Price Markers\"\r\n2. \"Fulton
    Sign And Price Markers Light\"\r\n3. \"Fulton Sign And Price Markers Symbols\"\r\nPS
    Font Names without spaces\r\n\r\n2nd page\r\nOT Family Name for all \"Fulton Sign
    And Price Markers\",\r\nOT style Names\r\n1. \"\"\r\n2. \"Light\"\r\n3. \"Symbols\"\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\n\r\nChristoph"
