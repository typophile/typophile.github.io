  Spiekermann]], [[Christian Schwartz]], [[Erik van Blokland]], 2008\r\n\r\nDesigner
  and FontShop founder Erik Spiekermann notes that \u201Cround typefaces keep going
  in and out of fashion, for many reasons. One of them always has been the media the
  face would be used for: type on screens and back-lit signs suffers from radiant
  light. Sharp type will look blunt, and the amount of bluntness that occurs is usually
  unpredictable. Then came Web 2.0 and rounded typefaces made a major comeback. I
  think they are here to stay, both as a fashion statement and for physical reasons,
  like in the old days. There will always be bad media which needs indestructible
  fonts.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo blunt the corners on his FF Unit, Spiekermann turned to Erik
  van Blokland, whose technical wizardry took care of a lot of the issues common to
  rounding letterforms. While it is soft, FF Unit Rounded isn\u2019t a sausage face
  or one only suited for comic strips. It looks friendly without losing its precision.
