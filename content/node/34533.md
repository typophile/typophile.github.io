body: I know this will sound utterly lame, but does anyone know of a digital source
  for English or swelled rules? Someone's going to say "just make em in Illustrator,"
  right? My answer? Me and illlustrator? Not so good. Suggested sources or how-to
  tips welcome.

  body: "ITC Bodoni Ornaments has a swelled rule. There is a PDF specimen at Sumner
    Stone's website: <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/html_pages/BodoniOverview.html\"
    target=new>www.stonetypefoundry.com</a>\r\n\r\nHowever, when I was setting swelled
    rules in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Moments-Ted-Williams/dp/1580175287/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-9781295-3414223?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182167452&sr=1-1\"
    target=new><cite>Wild Moments</cite></a> (Storey Publishing), I found that to
    get the proportions I wanted, I had to create my own. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1731-02_Spring-75_5498.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    chose to make up a dash in font format (Type 1: this was several years ago) so
    I could have it run along easily in text and be easier to implement than manually
    embedding a graphic over and over. There were hundreds of rules throughout the
    book. As a character in a font, I could also easily implement it in manuscript
    by running a GREP search sequence on the tagged AHs prior to importing. \r\n\r\nI
    wanted the rule to be flexible and not fixed to a certain width, so I drew the
    rule to 2000 units (2 em). Then I used horizontal scaling in the app to adjust
    the rule to full measure. I had to experiment a little with the proportions between
    the swell and the thin ends and with the degree of taper. (It looks a little ragged
    in this screen-res rasterization, but it was fine in print.)\r\n\r\nSetting the
    font size established the actual thickness of the rule and scaling set the width.
    I don't remember offhand the exact settings I wound up using, but the math was
    pretty straightforward because the width was twice the em and the swell was a
    known proportion of the em. (I do recall coming up against an upper limit on horizontal
    scaling.) \r\n\r\nI defined the size and scaling in a paragraph style, for easy
    application and formatting through tagged text.\r\n\r\nThis probably sounds a
    lot more complicated than it actually was. Perhaps there's an easier method these
    days. At the time, I thought it was a rather elegant solution to achieve a classic
    decoration that you don't see much any more -- precisely because it can be so
    tricky to implement in current technology.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "An inspired response! Thank you Kent. ITC Bodoni Ornaments does indeed have
    a swelled rule, and oh so much more. A steal at $39. I'll have to buy it just
    to give adjusting its point size and horizontal scaling a try. \r\n\r\nIf that
    doesn't work to my satisfaction, I may very well turn to my old Linotype catalogs
    and scan some samples. Perhaps I can still salvage my relationship with Illustrator.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again, and by the way, Wild Moments? Very nice, elegant."
