  body: "Most likely modified: the R is distinctively Tiffany-like, but the other
    letters, not so much.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, if the cover were designed in Photoshop,
    Rasterizing then Selecting the type, Modifying it by Contracting, Inverting the
    selection then Deleting the pixels outside the selected area would accomplish
    the effect."

  body: According to [[http://www.materialiste.com/culture/irreverent-carine-roitfeld-book-rizzoli|this
    recent blog post]], Alex Wiederin from [[http://www.buero-newyork.com/|Buero New
    York]] was in charge of the artistic direction. As he is [[http://www.google.com/search?&q=site%3Atypophile.com+alex+wiederin|well
    known for many other elegant custom typefaces]] for the fashion world, we could
    consider he has done the same for this book art cover.
