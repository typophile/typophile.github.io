  body: "Think this may be Tiemann-Mediaeval which has a digital revival by Gerhard
    Helzel.  I have this, including a full sample of the Roman and Italic in the Serif
    Font ID Guide, but I do not have a foundry link. Maybe someone can locate a source,
    but I got my sample from a friend who may know Helzel ( the font was done in 1995).\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Yes, Mike is right.\r\n\r\nTiemann Mediaeval was designed by Walter Tiemann.
    Klingspor published the Regular in 1909, with a Halbfett (Bold) following in 1911,
    and a Kursiv in 1912. Gerhard Helzels\u2019s digitization comprises 5 fonts: all
    3 styles based on the 72pt cut, plus the Regular and Italic based on ca. 10pt.
    \r\nHelzel\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.romana-hamburg.de/antiqua.htm\">Edition
    Romana Hamburg</a> has one of the more eccentric website designs."

  body: "Thanks for the link Florian. The site seems like a virtual catalog of Fraktur
    and Gothic typefaces, but are all those available as fonts from that site? The
    18-page PDF seems to repeat the material from the site pages, but there seemed
    to be no links for seeing complete character sets, or for ordering either. Being
    unable to understand German doesn't help, but there seemed to be pricing for everything.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Yes, all those typefaces seem to be available as digital fonts. There are
    no complete glyph set images. I can\u2019t comment on the quality. Looking at
    the website, one could easily dismiss the whole thing as amateurish, but maybe
    that\u2019s unfair. I should give it a try, one day, and then report here.\r\n\r\nSome
    information from the PDF, translated:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThe fonts marked with
    * feature Nordic characters (\xC5 \xE5 \xC6 \xE6 \xD8 \xF8 \u017Fl \u017Fk). Newer
    typefaces include the ligatures that weren\u2019t in existence prior to 1910 \u2013
    ft and tt, after R. Koch. [\u2026] Shipping: only via email attachment, hence
    no extra costs. Please specify whether Macintosh or PC, TrueType or PostScript
    is desired. New: OpenType also available.\r\n</blockquote>"

  body: "Some personal experience with Herr Helzel:\r\n\r\nBack in late 2005, I e-mailed
    him to inquire about purchasing a copy of the splendid script face, Derby. He
    replied (in pretty good English, BTW) that the easiest way was to simply send
    him the 15 Euro's and he would e-mail me the font on receipt - which he very promptly
    did.\r\n\r\nThe font was made in 2000 and is quite competently made."
