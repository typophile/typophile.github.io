    Zara, love your second entry. Is that your own typeface? Ultra-Bob, lovely word.
    Sharon: love your concrete poetry. Am surprised there aren't more entries of that
    type. And the face...gorgeous. Comrade Natecox, that is an outstanding entry!
    The T is very close to a cross...Gutenberg/Bible, etc. Lots of levels of meaning.
    I like the green one. And the quick brown fox made me laugh. Wonder what that
    would look like as a camouflage pattern \u2013 the visual equivalent to lorum
    ipsum?\r\n\r\nOk, here's my contribution to the revolution (inspired by Natecox)

    I really like the fox jumping over the dog imagery and wonder if it can be simplified
    even more, icon-style. There are so many great ideas here that perhaps the shirt
    artwork that isn't chosen can be uploaded onto cafepress to be ordered by those

    any. I usually don't like t-shirts with stuff on them, but I'd like to make an
    exception\u2026 but it really had to blow my mind away\u2026\r\nOf course, I'm
    very aware that my own ideas/design skills have pretty much sucked, so far. That
    being said:\r\n\r\n@almar: I think the \u201CT Rating\u201D really belongs on
    top of the back, I think your first idea was spot on. It does come from the back
    of DVDs, so, in a strange way, I even find it weird to see it on the front. The
    heart/nib is also very nice!\r\n@Miss Tiffany: your idea is really good too. The
    second one. I personally don't like it with the words on the front. Of course,
    the tag is sweet, but the reference to that song renders the shirt unusable to
    me. :D\r\n@eduardm: the design with typophile in unicode is nice, but I'd put
    that on the back or on another item, like a bag or something.\r\n@Kristi-Lynn:
    your idea is nice (I thought about something in those lines), but it's probably
    being overlooked because it just needed to be stronger in concept and/or design
    (a bit like my ideas).\r\n@Aleksandr: angel/devil, as I said before, very nice.
    Probably needs to pack a bit more of a punch\u2026 maybe a dark background, or
    something\u2026\r\n[That \u201CNeurosis\u201D one was something I'd consider wearing!
    The colours and the words on the back\u2026 very nice!]\r\n@ihoff: Tetris, yes!
    I saw no problem with the first one (I think it's still my favourite of those)
    other than, of course, the complete lines; they should at least be flashing! :P\r\n@John
    Langdon: very interesting! Not something I particularly like, but I really appreciate
    the idea and the design.\r\n@Zara: the asterisk and the lettering, both nicely
    done! (Though I'd personally change the type on the first one\u2026)\r\n@Ultra-Bob:
    HOOTENANNY! Funny! I like it! Colours and everything!\r\n@Natecox: Che Gutenberg,
    very nice! I'd lose the T altogether. I think the portrait should stand alone,
    like Che Guevara's. It would be a nice way to make people curious and possibly
    start a conversation! I also prefer the green one. Oh, and the brown fox and lazy
    dog are very nice too!\r\n@mollymonster: That makes no sense! With ears and everything?!
    I like it! :P\r\n\r\n(I write too much, I'm sorry!)"

    the one you mentioned (heart/nib), but with the rating on the back since the \"phile\"
    reference in the name has a direct correlation to the \"heart\" symbol.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    getting them sent in just in the nick o' time. I am still learning how to compress
    files.  I used WinRar, can anyone tell me if that is okay?  It is what I use to
    open compressed files, so I thought it would be okay.   Here is my first entry,
    \"I TYPE\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Battle25_Brian_Jaime_1_5657.gif]\r\n\r\n(The

    I particularly love Tim's ambigrams, Jos's stacked version, and Tiff's Obsess

    a series of the 'Typophile' 'T' alternating up and down. One in black and white
