  moment.\r\n\r\nIn another post Jens Kutilek kindly offered the following feature
  as a suggestion to a problem I was trying to solve (http://typophile.com/node/72726):\r\n\r\nfeature
  kern {\r\nscript grek;\r\nlanguage dflt;\r\npos space <50 0 100 0>;\r\n} kern;\r\n\r\nWhat
  I'm wondering about is the script and language statements. I've read about them
  a bit on Adobe's site but, admittedly, will have to back and revisit to better understand.
  One thing I didn't see is how these statements get used or activated.\r\n\r\nDoes
  the application call for them? If so the language statement makes some sense as
  most apps have a language setting. I don't, though, understand how the script command
  comes in to play. I've seen it in liga features without a language statement, but
  again, I don't understand how/when it is implemented.\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone know
  of a source that would be the equivalent to \"Features for Dummies?\"\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKen\r\nDummy

  body: "To answer this, it's probably best to consider some hypothetical feature:\r\n<code>\r\nfeature
    test {\r\n\_\_script latn;\r\n\_\_\_\_language dflt;\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_sub X by Y;\r\n\_\_\_\_language
    TRK include_dflt;\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_sub A by B;\r\n\_\_\_\_language DEU exclude_dflt;\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_sub
    C by D;\r\n\_\_script cyrl;\r\n\_\_\_\_language dflt;\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_sub E by
    F;\r\n} test;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWhen you compile the above, the font will actually
    include four different versions of the 'test' feature, and it will be up to the
    application to determine which of those versions to use when the user activates
    the 'test' feature (assuming this is a feature which the application allows the
    user to (de)activate).\r\n\r\nThe four versions of the feature are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.
    a version which will substitute A by B and X by Y which is intended to be used
    for Turkish\r\n2. a version which will substitute C by D which is intended to
    be used for German.\r\n3. a version which will substitute X by Y and which is
    intended to be used by other languages which employ the Latin script.\r\n4. a
    version which will substitute E by F and which is intended to be used by languages
    which use the Cyrillic script.\r\n\r\nYou'll want to make sure to include appropriate
    <code> languagesystem </code> declarations at the beginning of your feature file
    if you want to make use of language tags. These are also described in the OT syntax
    spec.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n\r\n"

    is when each peice of code gets used.\r\n\r\nWhere is the decision made as to
    which code gets used? Is it the norm that each peice only gets used when that
    language is selected in the application?\r\n\r\nThanks again"

  body: "In the example which I give, it is the responsibility of the application
    to correctly decide which version of the 'test' feature to use. If the user selects
    a run of text which is marked as being Turkish and then activates the 'test' feature,
    the application should apply the first version of the feature. If they subsequently
    apply this feature to a run of text marked as being English, the third version
    should be applied.\r\n\r\nHow (or for that matter whether) an application allows
    a user to specify the language of a particular block of text isn't addressed by
    OpenType standard.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
