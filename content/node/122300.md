  since folks here are more likely to have come across this sort of thing before.)\r\n\r\nIn
  the 1928 Scribner\u2019s (NY) edition of <cite>The Plays of J. M. Barrie</cite>,
  I\u2019ve noticed an odd convention: where a contraction happens in middle of a
  word (e.g., \u201Cdon\u2019t\u201D for \u201Cdo n(o)t\u201D), the apostrophe has
  the usual appearance. But when the contraction removes the entire first part of
  the word (e.g., \u201Cit\u2019s\u201D for \u201Cit (i)s\u201D or \u201CI\u2019ll\u201D
  for \u201CI (wi)ll\u201D), the typesetters consistently left the inter-word space
  there: not \u201Cit\u2019s\u201D or \u201CI\u2019ll\u201D but \u201Cit\u2423\u2019s\u201D
  or \u201CI\u2423\u2019ll\u201D (using \u2018\u2423\u2019 to represent a space):\r\n<img

  the comments someone mentioned seeing a book from that era with \u201Cy\u2019all\u201D
  written as \u201Cy\u2019\u2423all\u201D. The idea is the same: if the apostrophe
  indicates elision of part of only one word, the words aren\u2019t run together.\r\n\r\n\u2022\u2002Was
  this a reasonably widespread practice, or merely an idiosyncratic house style? or\r\n\u2022\u2002Was
  this perhaps an idiosyncratic <em>authorial</em> style, like A. A. Milne\u2019s
  use of \u201Csha\u2019n\u2019t\u201D in <cite>Winnie the Pooh</cite>, and should
  therefore be preserved in reproductions?"

    volume</a> of the Library of America's edition of Henry James's collected novels
    (1871\u20131880), published in, I think, 1984. All contractions are spaced: \"ca
    n't\", \"do n't\", \"it 's\". I can't remember if I saw a \"won't\" \u2013 not
    sure what would have been done with that.\r\n\r\nThe editorial decisions made
    in this book were a bit odd \u2013 they wanted to present the novels in their
    initial forms, though multiple revisions exist of most of them \u2013 and the
    spaced contractions are probably part of that. \r\n\r\nIt is decidedly jarring
    to a modern reader & seems out of place in a reading edition \u2013 though I think
    an argument could be made for it for a scholarly edition (which the Library of
    America isn't).\r\n"
