  font, agnoti. I have never made an entire typeface before but I am ambitious. Its
  missing some letters, the ones where I cannot find a nice solution. As I have said
  I've never made a font before and this is purely for my own pleasure and a good
  learning experiance.\r\n\r\nedit: *updated*\r\n\r\nId really like replies, comments,
  crits or ideas so that I can finish the font. Thanks for your time. I have attached
  a pdf(570 KB) and a png.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nDavid Pache\r\n"

  body: What's your motivation behind this font's design? At first glance, the letters
    seem grunge-y and piecemeal. After that, they don't seem to have too much to do
    with each other But the sharp angle on the up-stroke of the m looks professional!
    I'm so confused :(

    of classical type look. I was thinking about crusaders and medievel times while
    drawing the letters. I assume this is completely another style, but this was my
    inspiration : http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/LLH00001/frames?div=3&subdiv=0&locale=en&mode=reference\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid\r\n"

  body: David, I think that you should think more about the way broad-nibbed pens
    write on paper, as that is how letters were written in the middle ages (letters
    were also painted with a brush, or carved into stone, etc. but those were more
    for decoration than for reading). I'm not saying that you should necessarially
    copy calligraphic styles, or start writing by hand yourself, but do at least try
    to think about the tool and its style a bit more. Your "m" is getting there, the
    top curve on the "a" is a neat idea but needs a better transition, but the "s"
    is impossible, etc.

    Im going to review the way I drew them and also make it have cleaner lines. I

  body: "Before I could say a lot, I would have to see more sample than this. But
    I'd say that for the kind of font it is, it's coming along well. I'd work on having
    a consistent color throughout: for example, the o is some lighter than the n,
    and the eye of the g is even lighter. You can have a serif with somewhat random
    stress and still have all the characters the same color. Check out http://www.shinntype.com/
    Nick Shinn's work, in particular Oneleigh. The tail of your g is interesting,
    and I haven't decided whether or not I like it. Maybe (maybe) it could come a
    bit farther right, but I'll let you decide. I think my lack of confidence in criticisms
    is due to not being able to see in more context how the letters turn out to work
    together. So... put up more sample.\r\n\r\nNathanael"

  body: 'What I really meant was could you post a PDF with, like, a few lines or so
    of running text, or maybe a pangram. You know, show off all your character set.
    I think the color is getting better. I have to say I kind of liked it when it
    was a little more jagged. I also like the old e. The w,v,y could do with some
    flaring on the thin strokes. Overall, I think the concept behind this gives you
    a lot of freedom to just do whatever... as long as you make sure it looks good.
    I think you could do more with faceting, like you did with the n,m,h,u: do it
    on the a, maybe the b,d,p,q, possibly even the s and o. (But with this concept,
    avoid monotony too.) Some letters are still bolder than others. I wish some other
    people would come here and critique this (and while we''re at it, my font too),
    so you could get advice from more than just me. One last thing I''d say is work
    on making them all look like they''re related: for example, the s doesn''t look
    like it even knows the rest of the font. (For a good s, I''d think maybe Lydian.)
    The middle serif on the k is totally unrelated. Okay, so pretty soon I''ll just
    be rambling, so I''ll stop typing.'

  body: "Thanks again for being so helpful Nathanael, I really appreciate your aid.
    To make all the letters look like they belong together seems to be the hardest
    task for me, but Im slowly but surely getting there. As I said earlier, my s is
    probably the worst character to draw for me (it works better when its rotated
    180 degrees!) but Im working on it everyday. I will check out that s you mentionned.\r\nIt
    has really evolved since last year. I do attach some nostaligie to the hard, jagged
    edges but the soft curved look it has now feels more appropriate for the kind
    of learning curve I have set myself. Honestly though, too much freedom is a bad
    thing ( for example the k ). \r\nWell anyway, I attached the pdf which has a few
    missing letters still.\r\nSorry for not making proper sentences with spaces but
    I just cannot find an easy way to get my illustrator made characters into an easy
    to use font file. Will learn soon :) Also I may leave this font to settle down
    in my head for a moment, try some other style in the meantime.\r\nThanks for looking.\r\n\r\nhttp://dache.ch/agnoti3.pdf\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/agnoti3pdf.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid"

  body: "That's what I'm talking about. What I really want is for more people to come
    here and comment on this. I'm afraid that if I make any mistakes here, it all
    falls down on you, and keep in mind that I haven't done any expert studies into
    type design--I just go by what looks good, and I'm self-taught (though by looking
    at fonts drawn by the experts)--and I'm still just 17, so there's that. All that
    said, with this larger sample I think I get a better idea of what you're trying
    to do, and it gives some of your decisions a rationale. The s doesn't actually
    look as bad as I thought (though it still needs something), and in regards to
    it working better when rotated 180\xB0, one could say that about Weiss's s too,
    but then it loses the charm. I think the tail of the g does need to come right
    at least a little, and I stand by what I said about the flaring in the w,v,y.
    Also the f is out of character--too Baskerville. Centaur could be a good inspiration
    for some of the font. I look forward to whatever else you come up with as you
    take a sabbatical from Agnoti. I also wish someone <cite>else</cite> would come
    over here and look this over."

    this optical slant to the left done intentionally? I think it would get more dynamically

    I will try that. It certainly isnt something I did intentionally. The k will be
    revamped, but later on.\r\n\r\nIm not sure if this project merits a new thread,
    so Ill just post it here for the moment. Im working on the letter \"a\" uniquely.
    I must have drawn over 200 \"a\"'s in my sketchbook over the past months. I was
    wondering if anyone also attempted the experiment among you? Its quite a challenge
    to come up with an original idea when you hit the the 100's :)\r\nIm working on
    vectorising them all now, and plan to make many more for perhaps a greater project,
    who knows, its too early to say. These are by far not the best of the growing
    collection but the first 18.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aaa.png]\r\nhttp://dache.ch/aaa.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Good evening everyone.\r\n\r\nI have gone onto learning FontLab Studio. I
    did a quick typeset ( which took about 3 hours to do) and used it as my no risk
    try every button study. Its great when you see your very own characters appear
    as you're typing them for the first time.\r\nSo here is my first try with the
    software, the font has a huge number of errors, its ugly in most parts and isnt
    easy to read but I will clean it up over time. It may turn out to be just for
    titles or something. Is it ok if I use the same thread? It is based on my old
    5 letter logo. \r\n<a>http://typophile.com/node/15799</a>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rosti_3458.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo
    this evening, I added my agnoti characters in, did some kerning and just gave
    it a try. Work in progress, but its getting there.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/agnoti5_4282.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
