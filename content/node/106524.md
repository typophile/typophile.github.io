  body: "The cover is set in Seven Line Grotesque, a typeface (the first sans serif
    with lowercase letters) designed by English typographer William Thorowgood for
    Fann Street Foundry in 1832. A digital version\u2014Grotesque Regular\u2014can
    be purchased from myfonts.com.\r\n\r\nThe body text appears to be Century Roman,
    designed by Linn Boyd Benton in 1894 for Theodore Low De Vinne, publisher of The
    Century Magazine. There are many digital variations of Century (again, see myfonts.com),
    but Century Expanded or Century 725 might be your best matches."
