  can't use a (FF Blur) font because it's commercial:\r\n\r\n<cite>Probably Sony reworked
  it... They can't use a commercial font, of course, they must have their own font</cite>\r\n\r\nin
  <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/5250\">this</a> thread.\r\n\r\nI was wondering
  if it is so, why can't some brand use a commercial font?\r\n\r\nThank you."

    presumably because they want something more special.

    is that Sony thinks a font anyone else can buy is not good enough for them.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I post too slow!"
