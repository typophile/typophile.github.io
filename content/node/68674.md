  body: "As already written, it's difficult to find a typeface whith such a low-waisted
    R, but rather regular E and H.\r\nOne is Le Gendarmerie:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gautier/le-gendarmerie/\r\nWhich,
    unfortunately, has the \"wrong\" G.\r\nIf you have a healty budget, you can mix
    Neutra e Neutra no. 2."
