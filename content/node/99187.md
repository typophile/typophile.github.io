body: "The printing company where I work has produced letterhead, envelopes, and business
  cards for this customer since 2004, and we inherited the dies from another company,
  so I don't really know how old they are.\r\n\r\nThe upper line in the sample is
  from the letterhead, the second from an envelope, and the lower from the business
  card. At first glance (only) I thought they were the same, but the more you look,
  the more differences you find.\r\n\r\nThe name is all we have; the address, etc.
  appears to be AT Sackers Gothic.\r\n\r\nThe normal online automatic ID sites have
  come up blank. I'll check my books tonight, but I have more hope for the forum's
  collective knowledge.\r\n\r\nEven allowing for old, worn dies, these letters are
  so crude, with so many variations, that I wonder if they were hand-drawn. The other
  possibility that occurs to me is that they from pantograph engraving fonts that
  have never been digitized.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,
  and Happy New Year!\r\n\r\n-Eric\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img-Z27143637-0001_6371.jpg]"

    Roman will be pretty close to these letters.

      tolerates, University Roman might just work!
