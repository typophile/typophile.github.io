  body: I can't find an exact match, but if you want to recreate it, I think it could
    be easier to start with something like <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Linotype&ffam=Plak%20LT%20BlackCondensed%20-%20Regular&fid=c63b023c78a7ecc8795774718312265a&fsize=60&text=S&fit=1|Plak
    Black Condensed]]</strong> and not Bank Gothic

title: This looks like Bank Gothic to me with a rounded top and bottom. The cutout
  style is likely done in Illustrator.
