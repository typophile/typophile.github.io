body: "<strong> [[Indicies]] : [[History]] : Linotype Machine</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  first Linotype machine was built in New York by [[Ottmar Mergenthaler]] in 1886.
  Perhaps the world's first commercially-viable typesetting machine, Mergenthaler's
  invention could cast a line of type on-the-fly, greatly speeding up the process
  of metal typesetting. Newspapers around the world took advantage of this immediately.
  Newsppapers would always be the biggest users of Linotype Machines.\r\n\r\nThe Linotype
  Machine sparked a revolution in typesetting. Soon, competitor machines appeared
  on the market, like the [[Monotype Machine]]. Linotype Machines were used well into
  the 60s and 70s. From the late 1950s onward, however, Linotype had begun to produced
  photo-typesetting equipment, and later would go onto build digital machines. The
  typefaces  that were designed for these various machines would later be sold as
  [[PostScript]] (and other format) fonts by a company called [[Linotype Library]]
  (since 2005 simply \"Linotype GmbH\").\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Linotype Machine was in a
  large part technically possible only because of [[Linn Boyd Benton]]'s pantographic
  punchcutter.\r\n\r\nA two-part film showing in great detail how the Linotype machine
  works is available online at the Prelinger Archives at <a href=\"http://www.archive.org\">archive.org</a>.
