  body: Aharonda, just make it in a drawing program. Come on you can&#39;t be that
    lazy. If you have Illustrator draw it and make it a symbol and you can use it
    as many times as you want. Create it in photoshop and make it a brush or symbol.
    Not every solution is a font.

  body: Daniel, <BR>You sound as if everyone has Illustrator and/or is proficient
    <BR>at vector drawing. That&#39;s not the case and I think that calling <BR>him/her
    lazy was uncalled for. Good thing Yves isn&#39;t around <BR>to jump on ya! <BR>
    <BR>Aharonda, <BR>Is there some reason that you think this ornament came from
    <BR>a font and not someone&#39;s drawing? Do you need that exact <BR>design? <BR><br>

  body: There are some Ornament Pi fonts from Linotype, Letraset &#40;Type Embellishments&#41;
    and other foundries that you could probably find by searching on the term &#39;Ornaments&#39;
    at MyFonts.com. I looked though samples in the FontBook but didn&#39;t see this
    exact ornament. Sometimes they are called Fleurons. Sometimes they are extra glyphs
    in a font set.

  body: Thanks everyone for your answers. <BR>Daniel, you are right, I was just a
    bit lazy! <BR>Mike, thanks for  fighting for my honour - I need the exact design,
    but Daniel&#39;s solution seems the best. For some -weird!- reason, it didn&#39;t
    cross my mind I could redraw that, and I think I have the required skills. <BR>Yves
    - thanks but i will just redraw it. <BR>Again, thank you all for your time and
    attention. <BR>What a great forum! <BR>Aharon
