  body: "How are you intending to use it? If it\u2019s over a solid background colour
    you can get around it having the label. If it\u2019s over a photo or another multi-coloured
    background and there won\u2019t be too much of it then using Photoshop or Illustrator
    you could get rid of the label part fairly easily."

  body: I'm planning to use it over video. Dynamoe Hard looks good, but it's not available.
    I may have to try another font. Thanks to all for your help.
