body: Hi everybody, <BR> <BR>i&#39;ve to do a sleeve restauration for a music label.
  <BR>There are three fonts used on the sleeve. <BR>I&#39;ve maybe identify its but
  i&#39;d like you some confirmations. <BR>the head seems to be an helvetica and i&#39;ve
  find some similarities with the memphis &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/memphis/"
  target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/memphis/</a>&#41;  for the caption
  and the tracks. The one used for side one and side two reminds me something but
  i&#39;vent find it. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/51624.jpg"

  body: Looks like I was wrong about Lubalin. Memphis is pretty close but the lc g
    is incorrect.

  body: Karl, I think you&#39;re correct about the text face being Memphis. Given
    the age of the sleeve, the different &#39;g&#39; could simply be an alternate
    glyph in the photo face used for the original typesetting.

    before posting. Some serifs where only on memphis, and some characters like f,
    G and other wheren&#39;t the same on lubalin. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/51629.gif"
