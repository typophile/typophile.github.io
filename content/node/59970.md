body: "Hi there\r\nI'm working on a japanese version of an image book I designed \r\na
  year back. The english version uses Cronos Pro and ITC Giovanni \r\nfor the text.
  I would like to match the feel of the latin fonts.\r\nBut I'm afraid I'm going to
  use the wrong fonts\r\nand it will be some sort of a japanese version of Comic Sans.
  Smile.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest japanese font to replace Cronos Pro and\r\nGiovanni?\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Also consider the Ryo \"PlusN\" fonts, available as two serif families (Ryo
    Text PlusN and Ryo Display PlusN) and one sans serif (Ryo Gothic PlusN). These
    combine the kana and punctuation of the Ryo \"Std\" fonts, which were specifically
    tuned for readability, with the kanji and other glyphs from the Kozuka Mincho
    and Kozuka Gothic families.\r\n\r\nRoughly 70% of Japanese text is comprised of
    kana, so making the kana glyphs more readable increases overall readability.\r\n\r\nI
    believe that the Ryo PlusN fonts are bundled with the Japanese versions of the
    Creative Suite.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior Computer Scientist, CJKV Type Development\r\nAdobe
