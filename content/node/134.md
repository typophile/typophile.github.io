body: <i>But I would go further and argue that, in my humble opinion, the practically
  limitless number of religions and interpretations of the same religions possible
  must lead to the same sort of relativism.</i> <BR> <BR>Difference of opinion or
  interpretation does not imply relativism. Relativism is the radical belief that
  nothing is objectively true and that everything is culturally, psychologically or
  otherwise subjectively determined. Most religions deny relativism, and their disagreements
  are about <i>what</i> is true, not whether truth exists.

    room-temperature IQ&#41;. The reason Gulf War II was a bad idea is simply that
    the losses to humanity far outweigh the further material enrichment of a petty,
    greedy, obese, and intellectually, spiritually and morally superficial, provincially
    brutal, tiny segment of humanity. <BR> <BR>Currently, a good war would be one
    against the US. It harbors a corrupt and incorrigible regime/system that&#39;s
    killing and stealing at a greater rate than any other in history. If Americans
    are not able to correct their own course, the rest of the world will have to do
    it for them. Through any means that seem reasonable in context. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR> <BR>It is objectively true that if I drop a 200lb rock on your foot it is
    going to hurt. Neither culture nor individual psychology can determine that it
    will not hurt. We inhabit an objective universe with objective characteristics
    that every human being experiences. <BR> <BR>I did not say that this objective
    reality is <i>perfectly</i> knowable by humans, only that it is knowable. To claim
    otherwise is to embrace irrationality, to deny that there is any cognitive relationship
    between the human intellect and the physical universe we inhabit. Not only is
    this obviously false, it is also very dangerous and plays directly into the hands
    of tyranny, as Orwell warned. Yes, there is a subjective element to all our knowing,
    but this does not mean that what is known is known only subjectively or that what
    is known is not ontologically true.

  body: The term &#39;natural law&#39; is not mystical, it has been part of the vocabulary
    of western philosophy for hundreds of years. The use of the term in the manner
    you describe is a later development, and in my opinion a misleading one. What
    you are referring to are so called &#39;laws&#39; of nature, i.e. properties and
    relationships of the physical universe. Natural law refers to the idea that morality
    is not culturally specific or an invention of human intelligence, but refers to
    objective truths. For a fuller explanation, see the <a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/n/natlaw.htm">Natural
    Law</a> entry in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, or the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09076a.htm">Catholic
    Encyclopedia</a> &#40;the latter acnowledges that in English &#39;this term is
    frequently employed as equivalent to the laws of nature&#39;&#41;.
