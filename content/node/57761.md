  body: "Nope, Mike this is a freefont, with all the stars and stuff included. Don\u2019t
    know when regular user Artslons learns to write a descriptive title of his requests.
    I'll wait for some minutes until I provide the name of this \xBBWild West\xAB-font,
    mabe Artslons could edit his title? BTW, wild west font would make a descriptive
    title \u2026 ;^D"

  body: "If I can try to answer your question about 'descriptive title', in addition
    to what it says in the [[http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_2FAQ|FAQ]] about
    title, the main reason for wanting this is because the people who are trying to
    help you don't know which thread to look for when they think they found an answer,
    if all the thread titles say something like \"help identify this font\".  If this
    thread was called \"AIR - WORLD'S LARGEST\" we would all know which one to come
    back to with our answer.\r\n\r\nWe don't always get the answer at first glace,
    and so sometimes we have to go hunt for a while and then come back and try to
    find the thread. I can't tell you how many times I have had to search through
    the posts looking for the one I found an answer for, but couldn't find because
    there was nothing about the title that told me which problem I was answering.

  body: "What Mike said.\r\na) Try to describe the letterforms. In this case, something
    along the lines of \u2018decorated caps with stars, stripes, bulges; Wild West/Circus
    style.\r\nb) Mention the source, date and media (if known). Could be \u2018Mumbai
    leaflet\u2019 or \u2018French poster from the 1970s\u2019 or \u2018Headline type
    on www.example.org\u2019.\r\nc) Always helpful, in addition to a) and b): Type
    out the literal letters/lines in your sample: \u2018AIR - WORLD\u2019S LARGEST\u2019.\r\nThanks!"
