  body: This is, again, your original posted image - which IS Brush Stroke Fast. Yes,
    it looks a bit different. It's been manually condensed and skewed.

  body: "Mike, all do respect cause I know you have been doing this far longer than
    I have.  But I just don't see the likeness.  I have put the original font and
    the Brush Stroke Fast together in this image.  To me they are quite different.\r\n\r\nJeremy[img:sites/default/files/old-images/together_6381.jpg]"

  body: "The image you have labeled Brush Stroke Fast here is actually the (yes!)
    very different <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/edo.font?nb_ppp=50&text=PAIN+IS+WEAKNESS\"
    target=\"_blank\">Edo</a>. What you have labeled Mystery Font is, again, <a href=\"http://hometown.aol.com/rps82/Fonts/brshskfst.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Brush Stroke Fast</a>.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't clear to you yet,
    well ... I give up, Jeremy."

  body: Jeremy, I think it is quite safe to trust Mike's judgement. He's one of our
    very top people here; he knows his fonts. To tell you the truth, I only do routine
    checks whenever I credit one of his identifications because he's always spot on.
