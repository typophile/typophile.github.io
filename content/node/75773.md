  article about a study where students who \"[reviewed] material in hard-to-read fonts
  did better on regular classroom assessment tests than did their randomly selected
  counterparts reading the same material in easier fonts\".\r\n\r\nSort of interesting.
  But I'm sure we'll question the generalizability and their definitions of easy-to-read
  and hard-to-read fonts."
