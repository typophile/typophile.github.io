    better than a used BMW.\r\nAlmost exactly one year ago I bought a low-milage\r\nconvertible
    '94 model (the first year of the new body\r\nstyle) in great shape, for $8000.
    It looks nice*, it's\r\nfast enough, and it drives like a \"real\" car on the\r\nroad,
    which is pretty rare these days.\r\n\r\n* Pretty much like this, just not as shiny...\r\nhttp://www.ambassadorautosales.com/8952%201998%20bmw%20m3%20DR%20ANGLE.jpg\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I have no problem with my 2 Audis  A4 and S3 the only problem is I would
    not advise buying 2 of the same types of cars since the insurance company gets
    confused when you have 2 cars that are similar. Of course one of mine is left
    hand drive and the other right hand drive and one is silver with 4 doors and the
    other is dark blue with 2 doors and a hatch.\r\n\r\nGermans make the best beer,
    biscuits, cars and women but the Italians make the best looking bikes..\r\n\r\n"
