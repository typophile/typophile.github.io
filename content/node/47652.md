body: A quick poll, what does everyone do with their unused logos?  Some say they
  use them for 'spare parts', others for inspiration, others say they it's cheating
  to use them again.

  body: Well whatever anyones opinion about 'recycling' old logos - selling them is
    just wrong. And even more so if you buy them! What a farce.

    into new designs as fru fru.. on the background etc. :D sometimes if i really
    like the logo I include it on my portfolio :) \r\n"

  body: "Clashmore:\r\n\r\nWhen working in identity development the standards we should
    aspire to is a tailor-made design solution in response to a clients' communication
    problem. This recycling of logos is a reverse engineered idea where the designer
    (or client) browses unused concepts and logos and picks one based purely on aesthetics.\r\n\r\nTHAT
    is more like browsing in a Goodwill store for an identity than design.\r\n\r\nDesign
    is a process between client and designer and choosing a 'brand' from hacked old
    and unused logos is a farce and, I believe, unethical.\r\n\r\nIf a designer is
    lucky enough to be able to find an unused concept that BEST FITS a new project,
    well good for them. But selling them - please."

  body: "I think that it may be silly to buy a random unused brand rather than work
    one-on-one with a designer to come up with the best possible representation of
    their company, I don't see any way that it is unethical.\r\n\r\nRidiculously dumb,
    maybe. But if someone wants to sell and someone wants to buy, then win-win for
    them, I suppose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI personally use my 'unused' logos in personal
    portfolios, or just keep them for possible inspiration later on."
