body: "Can somebody please identify this script font that Evelyn Henson uses on her
  blog and in many of her prints? It seems to have a handwritten feel to it but from
  what I can tell, the letters seem to be pretty uniform.  I've posted two examples
  but if you want more just look at her website and blog. You'll see the same font
  appear over and over again on her website and in her art prints. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/evelyn_henson_font_sample_3739.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/evelyn_henson_font_sample_2_5062.jpg]"

  body: "Yes, this style of scripts seems to be flourishing lately. Other than the
    already mentioned Emily Lime\u2019s work, you could be interested in Laura Worthington\u2019s
    offerings, and several options over at Creative Market."
