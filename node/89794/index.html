  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>A little while ago, on this very site, Nick Shinn commented &lsquo;I do believe that &ldquo;non-transformable&rdquo; glyph shapes are inherently more legible than those which can be transformed into other characters simply by rotating or flipping. Which gives serifed type the advantage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I would agree with this, but can anyone suggest any non-transformable serif typefaces that fit this task?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Just publicity, but to quite a degree. I mean, the designer did a good job marketing it, but the construction&hellip; There have been some books marketed towards dyslectics printed with the typeface though.

<p>There has been heaps of research into legibility and the serif vs sans battle, but real conclusive research is found sparsely, and most of them contradict each other again. But that distinctive letters aid reading does help, and for dyslectic, breaking the rhythm does as well.</p>

<p>Interesting observation, expressed better than I&rsquo;ve managed in
the past. Maybe the Dutch went so far ahead in good design that
now it&rsquo;s all imploding in abstraction. A good example in the type
world is the delusional infatuation with upright italics.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There is however a difference between using one&rsquo;s instincts to
design something readable versus using empirical science as a
formal guide (even though the stuff is still thin on the ground).</p>

<p>Oh yes, don&rsquo;t get me started about the ecofont. Even if drilling holes in a typeface would save ink, wouldn&rsquo;t it better to create it out of dots due to the inkflow? Try to get that across to people. Or the existence of light weights.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Read Regular was a Helen Hamlyn research project instigated by a Dutch student at the RCA some years back. It was never released because the designer did not want it in the &lsquo;wrong hands&rsquo;. The typeface was tested to be used for optimal legibility purposes only in conjunction with &lsquo;correct&rsquo; typesetting. I guess the only person to be able to typeset it &lsquo;correctly&rsquo; was the student herself. Although I am not dyslexic myself I have read a book typeset in Read Regular and I find it incredibly easy to read. I don&rsquo;t find it &lsquo;ugly&rsquo; at all and I think it&rsquo;s a fantastic project with a real purpose of trying to improve people&rsquo;s lives and their experiences of reading&hellip; It may not be perfect, but opens up a lot of debate and avenues for other type designers to explore.</div>
