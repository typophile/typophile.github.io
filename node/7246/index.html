I guess designers tend to think humanist sans are slightly more legible than neo-grotesques? So they use the Univers for display and Meta for text.

		<div class="commentbody">I have been reading Bringhurst. He is eloquent and lucid, but I find he uses too many technical/typograhy terms(?). <BR> <BR>I always use a serif, sans serif combo, just that sometimes, it is not that clear cut. For example, would a serif font like Minion go with Fenice. Assuming the entire Minion family is used, for body and subheads, but Fenice is used at only 36pt and above. <BR> <BR>It would be really interesting to know the specific fonts you guys have married with what you consider good results. <BR> <BR>I'll post a pair to start: Franklin Gothic and Berkeley. <BR>This was a combo used when my previous publication was redesigned. <BR> <BR>Gerald: Bringhurst suggested Univers and Meridien, both by Frutiger, but somehow they don't really work well together, or I haven't found a way to make them work. I am still trying to place my finger on why. Possibly I haven't found the right sizes to combine them at. <BR> <BR>The book cover is interesting because most people would not know that the fonts are different. They look similar enough to pass off as one font, so it doesn't really bother me. <BR> <BR>Would be interesting to know what the others think though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Pairing typefaces is a challenge I constantly hit in graphic design, which is one of the reasons I decided to learn more about typography.  It was something I didn't know nearly enough about. <BR> <BR>I'm still learning, but here are a few rules that seem to work: <BR> <BR>1. The obvious: pair a serif with a sans-serif when possible.  This is a pragmatic rule simply because you usually need a display face and a text face for design. <BR> <BR>2. Go for balance, not contrast.  At small point sizes, a bold, robust sans will balance your serif text blocks.  At large sizes, a light sans or humanist might balance your serif better.  Balance is possibly the most important rule of design. <BR> <BR>3. Match x-height as close as possible. <BR> <BR>4. Match the geometry as close as possible.  A gothic sans (straight-sided O's) might not be the best companion for an old-style serif (circular O's). <BR> <BR>5. Match the &quot;voice&quot; of all the fonts you choose to the project.  Certain fonts will never work for a telecom ID system.  Others will never work for a basketweaving brochure.  And so on. <BR> <BR>6. The more you know about the background of your fonts - geography, history, etc. - the better you'll be able to make natural choices. <BR> <BR>Again, I'm still somewhat new at this. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm reading a lot of useful hints in the replies above (especially Paul's points 5 and 6), but I have to agree with Rodolfo. There are no hard and fast rules, not even the &quot;don't match up fonts that are very close&quot;. For every rule summed up in this thread there are beautiful examples that contradict that rule. Just at the top of my head, check out &quot;The New Cranbrook Design Discourse&quot; (1991). It's one of the first books I purchased after joining FontShop, and it made me realize that the possibilities are endless. For example on some pages Bodoni changes abruptly into an Egyptian at a slightly smaller size so the colour almost doesn't change. The effect, although a bit jarring at first sight, is strangely beautiful and has a subtle tension to it. <BR> <BR>The big thing is that there are many more parameters than just the type design that influence: colour, size, spacing, setting&hellip; When designing stuff for FontShop, I had to combine sometimes unwieldy amounts of different typefaces in one design, and somehow there was always a way to make it work. It takes a lot of balancing and trial-and-error, but it's an extremely satisfying exercise and makes you look at type in a totally different way. <BR> <BR>Karen, one of my more succesful magazine (re)designs combined FF Info with FF Meta, very similar faces, both by Erik Spiekermann. Which proves contrast isn't always the way. Furthermore the &quot;always use a sans/serif combo&quot; makes me feel really uneasy: it reminds me of that infamous quote from some version of the QuarkXPress manual: &quot;Always use Helvetica for headlines and Times for text&quot; (authentic!). On the other hand I've also done magazines which have more than 7 or 8 very different faces on one page, and that works perfectly well too. Go figure. ;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yves, your quote from the QuarkXPress Manual is hilarious!!!!! Got a scan? <BR> <BR>Anyway I am glad to hear that you have successfully used 7 or 8 different faces on one page. Would LOVE to see that. <BR> <BR>Think you will have to post some of your stuff (by popular demand). <BR> <BR>But I have to ask, why did you use both Info and Meta? They are sooo similar. What was your rationale?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Karen and Paul, sorry it took me so long to reply, but every time the fun starts around here it's bedtime where I live. :/ <BR> <BR>The quote from the QuarkXPress manual is from a slide Erik Spiekermann used in his FontShop presentations. My second favourite is his &quot;Thou shalt have no other typeface before me&quot; slide listing all the German companies that use Helvetica as their corporate ID type (see also his delightful &quot;Rhyme &amp; Reason: A Typographic Novel&quot; pages 100-101) <BR> <BR>The most interesting thing I learned when at FontShop was something Neville Brody said: &quot;Question every rule. Decide for yourself which ones are valid.&quot; That has been my main rationale ever since. <BR>I don't consider myself a &quot;real&quot; graphic designer:  I approach typography more like an architect or a researcher/scientist. My designs are almost always utilitarian, none of the flashy stuff that gets published in graphic design mags or typography annuals. I'm willing to post some samples to illustrate what I mean, but don't get your hopes up too high. Give me a day or two, as I'll have to search through some back-up CD's. <BR> <BR>The Info and Meta problem was a typical case of setting myself a challenge (I do quite often make things hard on myself just for fun). I hope my English won't fail me in trying to explain this case. <BR>I got handed an existing large format magazine which was pretty poorly designed. It used FF Meta as headline face and custom condensed Futura for text. <BR>Instead of redesigning the whole thing and get it over with, I decided to try to find a valid solution using only design elements from the original lay-outs, just like a teacher would help a pupil without imposing his own creative vision. The only thing I dropped was Futura: I avoid overused typefaces unless I can find a watertight good reason use them. As I realized Meta is in fact overused too, I needed to find a way to keep it interesting. And this is a situation where I usually fall back on Neville's advice. I contradicted the rule &quot;try using typefaces that belong to the same time period or that were designed by the same designer&quot; with the rule &quot;never use two typefaces that are too similar&quot; by adding Info to the mix. The research and resulting design process was extremely gratifying, although the end result is, well, I'm certainly not gonna win any awards. ;) <BR> <BR>See if you agree once you've seen the samples and let me know what you think.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Yves, why is there a duplicate of all the files?

D'oh&hellip;  <BR>  <BR><i>What font is used for the words, &quot;vacature magazine&quot;?</i> <BR> <BR>Helvetica Black Italic. See, I <i>do</i> use Helvetica once in a blue moon. I was not completely brainwashed after my month at Spiekermann's. ;)  <BR>  <BR><i>So you used Info and Info Display as the display type and Meta for body text?</i>  <BR>  <BR>No, I also used FF InfoText at text sizes. I'll post a few more examples where they are used alongside each other. You'll see: it's tricky, but it works.  <BR>  <BR><i>When Meta is used at bodytext size, it look a lot like Info, doesn't it?</i>  <BR>  <BR>Well, yes, but there's a couple of details that make it work in combination with FF Meta but not with ITC Officina. Again, I'll post some extra examples.  <BR>  <BR><i>I understand what you said about keeping part of the old design.</i>  <BR>  <BR>Don't fix it when it ain't broke (although the original design was badly executed I must say). I take a humble approach in graphic design, adapting my &quot;style&quot; to the client's or project's needs. And then I go and brag about it on the message boards. =D</div>
