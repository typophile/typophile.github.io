body: "<a href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/treeware\">Treeware</a>:
  Paper-based printed material, typically as contrasted with media that store or convey
  information electronically: <em>We have to ask whether online publishing will ever
  replace treeware</em>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.macmillandictionary.com/open-dictionary/entries/p-book.htm\">P-book</a>:
  Abbreviation for \u2018paper book\u2019, often contrasted with \u2018e-book\u2019
  (= electronic book). <em>Close the gap between the price of p-books and e-books,
  and increase the profit margin</em>."

  body: "From the [[http://www.catb.org/jargon/|Jargon File]]:\r\n\r\n<strong>dead-tree
    version</strong> [common] A paper version of an on-line document; one printed
    on dead trees. In this context, \"dead trees\" always refers to paper. See also
    <em>tree-killer</em>.\r\n\r\n<strong>tree-killer</strong> [Sun] n. 1. A printer.
    2. A person who wastes paper. This should be interpreted in a broad sense; 'wasting
    paper' includes the production of <em>spiffy</em> but <em>content-free</em> documents.
    Thus, most <em>suits</em> are tree-killers.\r\nIt is likely that both senses derive
    their flavor from the epithet 'tree-killer' applied by Treebeard the Ent to the
    Orcs in J.R.R. Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings\". See also <em>elvish</em>, <em>elder
    days</em>, and especially <em>dead-tree version</em>.\r\n\r\n<strong>treeware</strong>
    /tree\uFFFDweir/, n. Printouts, books, and other information media made from pulped
    dead trees. Compare <em>tree-killer</em>, see <em>documentation</em>."

    sustainable.\r\nP-books can last centuries in a functional state, and then be
    recycled.\r\nHowever, e-books obsolesce quickly (a new iThing every year), are
    made from non-renewable resources (mined minerals and oils), are much less conducive
    to recycling, and require energy-devouring server farms to exist.\r\n\r\nI'm a
    double-bassed typographer/designer, working in both media.\r\nSo isn't the distinction
    irrelevant?"

    to Techno-Narcissism: the physical \"artifacts of thought\" have been around for

    to be the rule.\r\n\r\nThe obsession with being up-to-the-minute has now become
    up-to-the-second, if ads for wireless service providers are to be believed (here
    inserts some very large grains of salt). The end result is a loss of perspective
    and a trivialization of what came before. Get a grip, guys."

  body: "@Nick Shinn: You might find this interesting. There is great debate surrounding
    the overall environmental impact of electronic versus paper:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ecolibris.net/ebooks.asp\r\n\r\nThe
    long/short is, paper uses a lot of energy and chemicals, despite the fact that
    trees are renewable. However, IF we didn\u2019t throw away our current device
    for the latest iThing THEN there might be a chance that the electronic could have
    a smaller footprint. However, greener energy and processing in paper-land could
    reduce their footprint as well\u2026"

    publications seems inevitable. I love books but haven't bought a single printed
    book since I got my iPad, and in my work as a graphic designer I see less and

    media <em>retrieves</em> what has been obsolesced.\r\nProfessionally, new media
    throws a lot of \u201Cmanual\u201D workers of the old media out of work, but creates
    an elite of transitional managers/directors who work in the new media managing
    its automation of the old jobs.\r\n\r\nThat was the case with photo-typositors,
    which put a lot of small-town lettering artists out of work, but created a new
    class of job for a select few to create fonts for the new technology.\r\nAt the
    same time, niches emerged at either end of the market: upscale, for super-high
    quality work in one-off luxury craft, and down-market, also deliberately anti-automated,
    for reasons of extreme cheapness, amateurishness, or counter-cultural aesthetic. "
