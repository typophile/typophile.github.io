  body: '[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/hessian/|Hessian]] is the most widely
    suggested for this font. not exact. how old is the logo? seems like it''s probably
    pre-digital and maybe based on something that is not currently available. maybe?'

  body: "Early 19th century type category called Tuscan had these split & curled ends
    -- like a \"bad hair\" day. Were various photo-composition era versions that could
    have been used for the logo. Digital versions usually are dumped in various unrelated
    categories like western, circus, and as in the case of Hessian, biker/motor cycle.So
    far found nothing closer than Hessian.\r\nDon"

    This one reminds me of those used in the embroidery industry mainly for baseball
    team purpose. Some suggestions for similars: [[http://www.dafont.com/bosox.font|Bosox]]

  body: "AFAIK the Hells Angels patch and logo are protected under copyright. So  if
    you find a pirate copy of a digital file that was originated by Hells Angels be
    careful not to break the law by using it, or that's not all that might be broken:)
    However, seems to be no LEGAL problem [at least in USA]  with creating a new digital
    design that matches an image provided it has a name that will not infringe.\r\nDon"

  body: "Seems to be an exact match in <a href=\"http://www.fontalicious.com/project/bike/\">Bike</a>
    by Fontalicious. Love the explanation:\r\n---start quote---\r\nWhen I was working
    on a project one day, I went a-lookin\u2019 for the Hell\u2019s Angels font. Not
    only did I not find it, but along the way I bumped into the information that they
    don\u2019t give that font out, it\u2019s in their secret files. Really guys??
    I guess now we all know one more thing about the infamously bad ass biker gang\u2026they
    pilfer cool fonts. Well, I went ahead and made it, that\u2019s how I roll. Last
    time I checked, no other designers were putting their life on the line making
    fonts. You\u2019re welcome.\r\n---end quote---\r\nHow close? decide for yourself:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bike_5867.jpg]\r\nDon"
