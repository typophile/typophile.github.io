  body: 'Ye Gods, this isn''t Crowdspring surely? I am new to forum, Have read posts
    regarding ''logo for eCommerce platform'' with interest, wondering whether this
    the first time this sort of misuse of generosity and transgression of sensitive
    unwritten code has occurred?  To ''Canada Glulam'': make a thoughtful choice and
    hire a designer, let them create a brief with you, pay them and treat them as
    professionals. Design is not blind, arbitrary twiddling type and so forth, no
    one knows a thing about your company and how to intelligently project that to
    say the VERY least. To me this is insulting. I am sure you do not mean to be though,
    and especially because of that, God help us.'

    your post insulting, as we see from the previous poster. In my opinion, based
    on what you have written; you need to approach a local Educational Institution
    which offers design studies and put forward your brief to their students. In this
    way you will receive your free logo and the students more or less will be happy
    to work for you, because they are getting a chance to show off their skills to
    an outsider, plus they will have a work to put in their portfolios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood
    luck,\r\nSB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.s. sometimes education and books can come in handy
    whenever assistance is needed.  \r\n\r\n"

    also encourage \"Canada Glulam\" to spend some time considering how they might
    react to a proposal for a project with ZERO guarantee of ANY compensation. Is
    that how you run your manufacturing company? You research, design and produce
    a product, and do so while knowing your client has solicited thousands of other
    manufacturing companies to do the exact same project? You invest your time, resources,
    materials, and expertise to complete the project. \r\n\r\nThen, \"your\" client
    picks only <strong>one</strong> manufacturing company to pay, and the other thousands
    of companies get nothing - except stuck with a useless product. They can't even
    sell it themselves, because it's specifically designed for the client and it'd
    be legal infringement to sell it. Sound like a good way to make a living? \r\n\r\nAnd
    worse---what would happen to the manufacturing industry if they all had to survive
    in this system? "

  body: "To me the most worrying issue isn't about the fee, it's about how the work
    of a designer is misunderstood and design trivialised. The fact that Canada Glulam
    could post such a request on this forum without embarrassment shows that we have
    a vast problem of how what we do is perceived and valued. Most of us would feel
    we are so well outside the realm of Crowdspring and similar sites we can ignore
    the phenomenon but they are having an insidious impact and are redefining and
    solidifying what we do as light weight and low status. As are those crass and
    laughable sites where 'off the peg' logos can be chosen like Build-A-Bear. We
    might dismiss all this as beneath our concentration but I was at a branding conference
    recently where the presentation of one of those sites (and it's \xA310 price tag)
    was greeted with extraordinary excitement and rapturous applause by professionals
    who would be horrified to apply such standards to their own fields. Can't help
    feel it is our fault if design is held in such slight regard and it makes us very
    vulnerable now. There has always been hack, ignorant work of course but computer
    technology is giving it a spurious respectability and power to overwhelm and control
    and as anyone has the means of production, anyone is a designer and we are diluted
    into oblivion! The responsibility lies with us to change this and establish the
    high ground. Everything is in flux. Now or never I rather think. "

  body: "What amazes me lately is the ability of those who are in now way shape or
    form, designers, to find themselves WORK as designers. \r\n\r\nI find the problem
    to be that our audience is ignorant (clients).\r\n\r\nI recently printed a banner
    for a guy. He got to the framer and came back to ask us why his logo (which looked
    so nice on his business card) looked so bad at large sizes. I calmly explained
    that we were not at fault--some idiot decided to livetrace the most simple of
    compass designs and not even worry that it couldn't become any bigger without
    being noticeable. \r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that the compass can be found in
    Zapf Dingbats, outlined, and voila! Some guy managed to find a picture on the
    web, I'm presuming, and livetrace it. Which is sooo much more work than it required.
    \r\n\r\nI offered to give him a perfect logo for payment of 1 hour--but he's got
    his \"logo guy\" working on it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, God help us help them. "

  body: "> the work of a designer is misunderstood and design trivialised\r\n\r\nI
    agree, but the misunderstandings typically come from people who've never hired
    a professional designer before, so it's understandable that they don't understand
    the profession and have no idea what things cost. When working with them designers
    need to educate them. Corporate clients, on the other hand, typically have worked
    with designers before and understand what typical fees are."
