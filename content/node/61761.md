  <strong>Helvetica</strong>\r\n- <strong>Frutiger</strong>\r\n- <strong>TheSans</strong>\r\n-
  <strong>Fedra Sans</strong>\r\n\r\nWe're looking at the following Arabic typefaces.\r\n\r\n<strong>Frutiger
  Arabic</strong> http://www.linotype.com/617936/frutigerarabiccomplete-valuepack.html\r\n<strong>TheMix
  Arabic</strong> http://www.khtt.net/page/614/en\r\n<strong>Fedra Arabic</strong>
  http://www.khtt.net/page/256/en\r\n<strong>Insan</strong> http://www.linotype.com/184192/insan-family.html\r\n<strong>Atrissi
  Sans</strong> http://www.atrissi.com/wordpress/?p=157\r\n\r\nAs we don't speak or
  read Arabic I just wanted to quickly get an idea from you about readability of the
  above in longer texts, e.g. brochures, articles.\r\n\r\nWe have an idea that Fedra
  Arabic may be quite good in terms of readability and 'normal' feel for longer texts.
  Would the same be true for Frutiger Arabic, TheMix Arabic, Insan and Atrissi Sans?
  We would use them for headlines and signs, for example, but which of them would
  be also suitable for longer texts? Or would we be looking at having another text
  font in addition to the headline font?\r\n\r\nThanks for any opinions."

    the moment this is our favourite to use, so I'd be happy if your answers would
