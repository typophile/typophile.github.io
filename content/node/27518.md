body: 'Barbarians at the gates! The Apple Typography Wiki - http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Apple_typography
  seems to have been messed up, half the content has disappeared and heretics are
  ranting about Apple Garamond! Maybe the typophiliMac faithful can step in and sort
  it out. Is "logography" even a real word? '

  body: "In my short time posting here, I gather OS-bundled fonts are not regarded
    very highly...with Arial for Windows being at the very top of the S#!^ list. Comic
    Sans is a close second for encouraging the most seething hatred.\r\n\r\nBeing
    a scumbag PC user for the last decade, I guess I don't have all that much sympathy
    for Apple Garamond or Myriad Apple. Myriad Pro, Garamond Pro and Garamond Premiere
    Pro in OTF seem to do just fine when they can fit into my sign design needs. Myriad
    is a very good typeface to use in making neon filled channel letters."

  body: Regardless of the Apple Garamond slant, missing are additions and clarifications
    I made regarding Espy Sans and other eWorld bitmap faces and Newton system fonts.
    It looks like some information was moved to related Wiki entries, but not everything.
    Where does one start in order to get this whipped back into shape? Revert! Revert!

    Apple typefaces can now be found on its own page here:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_typefaces\r\n\r\nNeedless
    to say, it still required a bit of tidying up after I reviewed it."

    text, and it turns out it's simply been moved here:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fonts_on_the_Mac\r\n\r\nAll
    that happened is that he thought that it was strange to mix a discussion of Apple's
    corporate identity with a discussion of their bundled fonts and rendering technology,
    so he unilaterally decided to split the article in two.  So far as I can tell,
    nothing has actually been lost in the process."
