    body: 'Im actually redesigning my resume. Goudy Old Style is the main header font,
      and the body font. I was looking for another font to head the sub categories,
      right now I am going with Antonio. I perused the myriad of other Goudy fonts
      but didn''t fall in love with any for the look I am going for. Thank you for
      the good advice though. '
