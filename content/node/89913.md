body: "I'm embedding a PDF417 Barcode font in a PDF but when it comes time to output
  pdf thru my Esko print/prepress equipment, I get an error, \"Glyph zero, Character
  code 48 is missing from the font\". \r\n\r\nI contacted the author of the font,
  and this is the response I got: \r\n\r\n[It is true that the PDF417 font does not
  have an active glyph at location \"0\", because \"0\" is the place in this font
  for a white symbol. This is not normally an issue except in rare cases such as what
  you are experiencing. Placing an active glyph in location \u201C0\u201D of the font
  would cause a corrupt barcode to be created. I suggest working with the support
  department of the Esko device so that barcode fonts can be used on their device.]\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts on what I can do to fix or repair the font or PDF? Is there a way to replace
  the \"white symbol\", so I dont have problems? I really have no experience with
  editing or building fonts. I did conversions with TransType Pro and ran Font doctor,
  tried subsetting the font, ect,, and still had the same problems. I really can't
  convert the fonts to paths or image, as I have 10,000+ pages and it makes the PDF
  huge."

  body: "Nick, I presume this error is given because the software used <em>inserts</em>
    a \"0\" somewhere in the barcode and then <em>relies on the font</em> not to show
    anything. In InDesign, for example, that would flag a \"missing glyph\" error.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to this\r\n\r\n<cite>Placing an active glyph in location \u201C0\u201D of the
    font would cause a corrupt barcode to be created.</cite>\r\n\r\nit should be possible
    to add a \"0\" with a zero width, non marking glyph. Then you can use them as
    much as you want and nothing will appear on paper, and the Esko software will
    stop complaining."

  body: 'Thanks everyone - you printed me in the right direction. I downloaded a demo
    glyph editor and looked at their other fonts that do work. They had a nodes that
    are 0 in width and height on their other fonts for white space, so I drew a box
    that was 0 in width and height. Font works with no problems now! '
