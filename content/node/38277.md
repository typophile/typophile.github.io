  a public figure, and he was born in 1949, and it would be a nice touch. I was hoping
  one of Zapfs faces would have come out then, or at least been started during '49,
  but it looks like a dead period between palatinio and optima.\r\n\r\nPreferably
  a sans, but I'll take a look at anything right now.."

    you'll find that 15 weights of various typefaces were released in 1949. Not sure
    which of these you can get in digital, though\u2026"

    leave a lot of wiggle room, so we were looking for more ways to tie the choice
    in.\r\n\r\nThanks for the GT-d link - didn't know it existed. I'll have a squizz."

  body: "Any edition of <em>An A-Z of Type Designers</em> is a good resource for this...
    Following the name of each type designer is a list of his or her typefaces, followed
    by the year(s) of development or release.\r\n\r\nOn page 58 of the latest edition:
    Trade Gothic, 1948-60 (Jackson Burke)\r\nOn page 59: Normandia, 1946-9 (Alessandro
    Butti, with Aldo Novarese)\r\nOn page 74: Diethelm-Antiqua, 1948-50 (Walter J.
    Diethelm)\r\nOn page 76: Electra, 1935-49 (William Addison Dwiggins)\r\nOn page
    101: Emergo, 1948-53 (Sem L. Hartz)\r\n\r\nAh, check this out, on page 111: Savoie,
    1949 (Marcel Jacno)\r\n\r\nThe book has 200 pages, I'm sure there's some more
    typefaces to be found! :-)\r\n\r\nAnother good resource might be Sebastian Carter's
    <em>Twentieth Century Type Designers</em>."

    have something to do with a scarcity of types released in 49?

  body: "What would type designers have done during the war. I suppose a few would
    have served, but I can't think of a \"war effort\" field they could have entered
    en masse.\r\n\r\nUnless they were the ones writing \"Kilroy was here\" on everything
    that moved."

  body: "The foundries that manufactured their designs would have certainly been preoccupied
    with casting all sorts of war material. And in that era type design was one aspect
    of a complex manufacturing process, I would think that the war would have curtailed
    or slowed down many types being released in the few years after it ended. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Many factories (Monotype UK, D. Stempel AG Germany, etc.) were converted
    over to war industry production for a time. Many older type designers stayed in
    their posts during the war. Younger ones, like Zapf, were drafted, although his
    lettering skills lead to his being assigned to a cartography office in occupied
    France. Some other designers were not as lucky; Klingspor's Rudo Spemann died
    in action. And Vojt\u011Bch Preissig was interned in the concentration camp at
    Dachau, where he died.\r\n\r\nBy 1949, many English and German foundries (select
    foundries in both countries were bombed) seem to have back in business, at least
    that is what their period promotional materials seem to suggest."
