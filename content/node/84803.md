  and my neighbours have their outdoor lights on. I live in Iceland and the time of
  the light nights are over for this year. \r\nI have being thinking about some of
  the type designers that were giving us very fine work in the beginning of the digital
  age and I wonder why some of them that used to work for big companies seem to have
  disappeared, information about them is scarce and maybe none.\r\n I am thinking
  of people like Carol Twombly, Chris Holmes, Charles Bigelow, where are they now?\r\nWould
  be happy if anybody could tell me about them."
