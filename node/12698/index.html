It seemed a great way to liven the entire line of Bazaar's up. That magazine has not been the same since Liz Tilberis (RIP) passed away. Photography is still brillliant, but the design has repeatedly fallen short. IMHO.

So. I see no reason why a magazine cannot change as long as it is for the better.</div>

Mixing sans is a difficult thing to do. I think either (A) they both have to be of the same lineage, i.e. Humanist, Grotesque, Geometric; or (B) the title face needs to be more geometric or grotesque and the text face needs to be very humanist. This is only a theory. I hope others respond to this as I'd be interested in others opinion.

You are right. Magazines should not become stale.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">How much text are you setting with a sans? Just out of curiosity? 

You might consider a grittier sans such as <a href="http://www.macrhino.com/">Sophisto or Stalemate</a> for the heads, captions, callouts and other things. 

I find that magazines which do use all sans tend to have difficulty setting forth a clear hierarchy. One important factor to consider is contrast. One obvious way to include contrast is sans versus serif. With using only sans you elimate that. </div>

To me, such publications are saying "we're more concerned with our image than whether you are comfortable reading our publication." To which I say "fine, I'll take my readership elsewhere."

That being said, if you want to mitigate that tendency as much as possible, a good humanist sans would help a bit.

Anyway, to comment on T. Leaves question: If you can swing it, spring for a humanist sans with a wide range of weights, and use the extremes in display settings (e.g. extra light or black) to introduce the contrast you're after. <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/whitney/index.html">Whitney</a> comes to mind.</div>

I though the whole point of the "don't mix sans with sans" rule was that fonts with a common lineage tend to clash. The small differences between them will subconsciously be seen as mistakes, while two very different fonts would establish contrast.

So my advice is not to mix sans unless they are very obviously distinct. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">So Joe, what do you have against Legato, exactly? For a text face, what's more important than to "build proper word and line images"? And if you believe Bloemsma about that, and you consider <strong>how</strong> it's supposed to be doing that, then it sort of follows that no other font (certainly no other sans) does this, so...

Amira: I have a lot of trouble liking it.

		<div class="commentbody"><em>I though the whole point of the “don’t mix sans with sans” rule was that fonts with a common lineage tend to clash. The small differences between them will subconsciously be seen as mistakes, while two very different fonts would establish contrast.

So my advice is not to mix sans unless they are very obviously distinct.</em>

I disagree -- I often perform experiments against all those tried and true golden rules, and the "never mix sans unless they are very obviously distinct" doesn't hold up if you know what you're doing. I redesigned a large format magazine combining FF Meta with FF Info and it looked perfectly fine. Agreed, it takes some more effort and thinking through to pull it off, but that shouldn't stop you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The humanist sans is most certainly greatly over-rated. Which doesn't mean it's useless: compared to most any serif design for example it can express a distinct casualness; and compared to a geometric sans, it can express more humanity, and also be more readable. The fallacy of course is that a typeface has to be either humanist or constructed; "with us or against us".

Bravo Yves, that's the spirit! Use your own eyes and mind and trust (the Force) within you. Too often people are hindered by rules and fear critique from others. The only rule I adhere to is: "There is no rule that should always be adhered to"
