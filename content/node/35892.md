body: I'm looking to buy a copy of Tschichold's The New Typography but am unsure which
  version on Amazon is the best one to get; there's a version from 1998 and a more
  recent one from 2006. Anyone got any advice on this?

  body: "The more recent <a href=\"http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/5581001.html\"><strong>2006
    edition</strong></a> has a new foreword by Richard Hendel, plus a different cover
    design. Everything else is exactly the same in both editions.\r\n\r\nHendel's
    foreword is good, but what you really don't want to miss is Robin Kinross's excellent
    introduction."

    that I've never read this book before.
