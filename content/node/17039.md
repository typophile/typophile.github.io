    morning from the art director of <em>Good Night, And Good Luck</em> who insisted
    that they did <em>not</em> use Helvetica in the film, contrary to what was claimed
    in the article (<a href=\"http://www.marksimonson.com/article/145/good-article-shame-about-good-night\">more
    here</a>). If this is true, then it is unfortunate that they chose to pick on
    this particular film in the article's lead. It could be a serious blow to the
    whole cause. I may be forced to resign my position in Designers Against Anachronistic
    Film Typography (DAAFT)."

    because the WWII Russian propaganda leaflets were set in Arial Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nOne
    of Ross' and my earliest typographic jobs, when we first started Tiro, was reproducing
    French identity cards and vermouth bottle labels from the 1920s for a film based
    on the flying exploits of Antoine de Saint-Expury. If I recall correctly, we modified
    Franklin Gothic for the identity card type, and were able to get quite close without
    too much difficulty. Even if it wasn't completely accurate, it also wasn't recognisable
    as a specific later typeface. Fun work, and something that could become a lucrative
    and interesting field for many of our colleagues if the studios start paying attention
    to Mr Simonson. :)"

    for the titles - that is such a recent font, albeit with a vintage look.

  body: Yeah, I was disappointed by the type choices in the credits, too. But in my
    "spot the wrong font" hobbie, titles are exempt. Because they are part of the
    present, they can't be considered anachronistic. An art deco font made in the
    '90s for a movie set in the '30s is okay for the titles since they exist outside
    the context of the film's setting. Aside from that, though, they could have been
    much better. Bodega Sans is one thing, but Skia??? Please. At least they didn't
    use Trajan.

    go a more logical route first seeking what their own studio or CBS Studios might
    still have available in terms of sign props? (Free standing extruded, cast or
    cut letters.)\r\n\r\nMy younger son works in L.A. at an antique store that specializes
    in architectural hardware from European gothic cathedral door hinges, to brass
    spitoons from the 1920s. He says many of the set and prop workers in Hollywood
    hunt for period style fixtures, door knobs, ceiling fans, etc., then bring them
    back to the prop dept. workshop to make knock-offs for the various sets.\r\n\r\nMy
    point being that the responsibility for making/finding letters for \"CBS NEWS\"
    might have gone to through the \"property master\" to the prop dept instead of
    through the art director to the art dept. \r\n\r\nInstead of creating all the
    letters from scratch, the prop people might have gone the research route and found
    only a few existing sign letters, mistakenly identified what they had as Helvetica,
    thus constructed any missing characters as Helvetica???\r\n\r\nBesides, we know
    that both <a href=\"http://www.scottsigns.com/ExtLtrs.htm\" target=\"new\">signage
    manufacturers</a> and sign makers deal in a different scale than graphics people.
    If type designers prior to phototypesetting frequently modified character design
    for scaling of titling weights, wouldn't even skilled sign crafters consider subtle
    modifications for characters ranging from 12 inches to 20 feet tall? I think so."

    One notable one was an interaction between Kong and his girl friend. It seems
    every time the camera was on Kong in NYC he was surrounded by snow and every time
    it was on her there was no snow. Another one is when Kong goes down a Manhattan
    street destroying cars and everything else and when the girl friend follows down
    the same street the cars are perfectly parked with no damage.

    on the recently released DVD. It was fun to see them back to back because the
    new one follows the original store very closely and includes many references to
    it. The titles on the new version--the ones with Bodega Sans--were similar to
    the original, but could have been better. In fact, in all the extras on the DVD
    of the original, they did a really good job of aping (ha!) the original titles,
    even creating a font to match the lettering. The titles in the new Kong look \"inspired
    by\" while the DVD's look astonishingly like the real thing, down to scratches
    and frame jitters.\r\n\r\nThe \"one other thing\" I noticed that's mentioned at
    the end of the article was Bodega Sans used for dimensional letters above a marquee
    on a theater. It's a fleeting image and I missed it the second time I saw it.
    It may well have been my imagination. There was one more thing (which Scott Stowell
    mentioned on Design Observer and I had forgotten about): During the opening scenes
    depicting the Great Depression, there is a down-on-his-luck guy sitting in front
    of a box labeled in large letters set in Optima. Aside from those few things,
    I thought they did a great job on signs and such. I noticed there were three sign
    painters listed in the credits. Nice."
