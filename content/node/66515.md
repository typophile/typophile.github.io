  \r\n\r\nThe idea of breaking down a typeface into its most minute aspects used to
  seem unnecessary. Coming from a web design background, I chose one of the 11 websafe
  fonts and pushed ahead.\r\n\r\nWhen CSS came along and positioning became a lot
  more malleable a component of the design process, I began to see type in a different
  way. More recently, embedding just about any font into a website has become possible
  through various means including CSS and XML-injected Flash content. That's when
  I knew I should take this stuff more seriously.\r\n\r\nSo I'm here to browse conversations,
  and learn from what appear to be a community of some very learned individuals. I've
  already seen a few typography books mentioned as must-haves and will be picking
  them up sooner than later.\r\n\r\nSo my hopes in being a part of this site is that
  it will become part of my daily routine, and I'll pick up some knowledge I otherwise
  can't afford to get in a classroom environment.\r\n\r\nJustin\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    learned a lot more here than I would in a classroom! :)
