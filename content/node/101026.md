  issued by the Fonderie Clement, Bruxelles.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClementNumbers_6258.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  5 is my favorite, the upper part is unique.\r\nI fell in love with it. And so I
  decided to digitize them all.\r\nI hope you enjoy them! I made them with love.\r\n\r\nAvailable
  for download at http://goo.gl/cgxts Just $15\r\n\r\nI'm not completely sure, but
  I think that Clement was a Didot's apprentice, who then started his own foundry.
  If anyone has more info on that, I will appreciate it.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPablo"
