body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've an issue with a font I developped. This font is an OTF which
  contains dingbats. I can't seem to get the font to be recognized by Microsoft so
  it appears in the function \u201CSpecial Character\u201D (from the Insert menu)
  in Word (of course it shows fine in the list of fonts available). I've tried creating
  a new font containing only the dingbats (which I identified as a Dingbats in the
  Supported Unicode Range), and that works. But is there a way to make the whole OTF
  be available in the Insert Special Character function?\r\n\r\nAlso, in Word 2008
  (on Mac only) the ascenders and decenders are cut off in the preview, any way I
  can fix that? (prints fine and also export to PDF is ok)\r\n\r\nThx!"

  body: "Hi Martin,\r\n\r\nonly glyphs which have a unicode assigned can be inserted
    in Word. If your dingbats are in the ornament OT feature in your font, they probably
    have no unicode. You could assign them unicodes from the Private Use Area to make
    them accessible."
