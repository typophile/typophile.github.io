  body: sorry just an offhand reference to all the fine detail in the images, and
    a comment on the general hyper-embellished look -- if you imagined it as a three-dimensional
    object the slender bits if brought near to the eye could conceivably cause severe
    damage or even poke it completely out. Damn, it's not as fun when you have to
    explain it ;)
