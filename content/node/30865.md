  body: That narrow display sans was the house headline face for Zembla magzine which
    folded over a year ago; I'm not entirely sure but think it was custom made for
    frostdesign in the UK who were the magazine's designers. You could either try
    asking them direct; info@frostdesign.co.uk or looking at the colophon in any back
    issues you might have of the Zembla magazine itself.
