  body: 'These kinds of posters were usually hand-lettered, so they don''t necessarily
    match standard typefaces. The serif font on No. 2 resembles Barnart Brothers &amp;
    Spindler''s Old Roman, while the sans on No. 3 is similar to Futura Bold Condensed. '

    been on my to-do list for a couple of years; Windsor Bold might be an acceptable

  body: i hear ya, its a shame there is hardly any information about it... i also
    think Garamond Premier Pro - bold subhead, medium caption, & bold italic could
    work. thanks for your help!
