  of the glyphs windows ?\r\n\r\nI have them cos I have a vfb. file that I'm using
  to generate opentype fonts both PS and TT flavours. The blue icons appear if I generate
  the TT opentype font and then open that font file with Fontlab.\r\n\r\nIs it possible
  to generate TT fonts with the same vfb I'm using to generate the PS font, or do
  I have to do something to the vfb to make it generate TT opentype fonts.\r\n\r\nc."

    it's possible to generate PS and TT from the same source. However, sometimes it's
    useful to save a separate .vfb, convert outlines to TT, convert hints to instructions
    (both can be done using Tools / Action Set), and then using the TrueType Hinting
    tool, review the screen appearance of the font. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "You need to set the correct path direction separately, after converting to
    TT outlines but before converting hints to instructions. Indeed, the three steps:
    \r\n\r\n1. Outline to TT\r\n2. Path direction\r\n3. Hints to instructions\r\n\r\nare
    necessary. In addition, you may want to expand kerning if you defined class kerning.
    Note that OpenType TT (.ttf) fonts can use old-style \"kern\" table kening as
    well as new-style OpenType GPOS \"kern\" feature kerning. OpenType PS (.otf) fonts
    can officially only use the latter (although it is possible to put the former
    in as well) and Type 1 fonts can only use the former. \r\n\r\nThere are some implications
    involving kerning in OpenType TT (.ttf) fonts such as that some applications will
    only see the old-style kerning and some will only see the new-style kerning. If
    your kerning table is really extensive, you may want to generate your \"kern\"
    feature explicitly (using the OpenType panel), then expand kerning using Kerning
    Assistance while subsetting it to a specific codepage. In Kerning export options,
    you'd need to allow both types of kerning to be included. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam

    Hints to instructions\r\n\r\nwould that relate to :\r\n\r\n1. Curves to TrueType\r\n2.
