    wordmark for Black Tower wine [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BlackTower2_6413.jpg]
    or for Oktoberfest [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unknown_Oktoberfest2_3868.png]\r\nThere
    is at least one contemporary blackletter that has some of the flavor of the wordmark
    for Duvel. For example Johan Mosse's Guillemet http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/gestalten/guillemet_ot/ot_ps\r\nI
    trust there are others...\r\nDon\r\n"

    of the serifs, round some corners where the angled strokes meet the vertical,
    delete the fancy stuff on the capital, and it would be suggestively similar to
    a lighter weight of Duvel.\r\nDon"

    blackletters, that would match the Duvel word-mark, and others that I posted,
    \ rather than the endless proliferation of angry, angular blackletters that are
    offered by fontmakers for consumption by bikers, heavy metal, pained tattoo aficionados,
    urban rebellion, Reich revivalist skinheads, Putinist fascists etc. So, fontmakers,
    get cracking.\r\nDon"

    </em>\r\n\r\nHah. I like it, Don. That would surely hold true for marketing to
    consumers in the second half of life. Therein, perhaps, is the limitation, though.
    I'm not a designer or in advertising, but it seems like angry blackletter is used
    for a huge range of products aimed at the younger crowd, while happy blackletter
    seems limited to saying, \"This is German\". There are exceptions and I may be
    wrong, but that's how it appears to me as a consumer.\r\n\r\nI was pleasantly
    surprised when, in 2002 - a time when there was still plenty of that angry blackletter
    on rock album covers and in video games - Ray Larabie gave us <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/vinque/'
    target='_blank'>Vinque</a> (clearly a modification of William Morris' work). And
    this from a video games programmer.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Mike. Vinque works for me! Morris blackletters are good.\r\nBTW all consumers,
    except those that die young, have a second half of life quite different from the
    angst ridden first half. Nuff said. Lets get the designers working!\r\nAs for
    the German thing there is a big difference between laid back Fat Fritz in the
    beer hall,  and the heil this and that gang.\r\nDon"
