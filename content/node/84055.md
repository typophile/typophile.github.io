  The client is pretty much set on the letterforms. Any pointers appreciated. Cheers.

  body: Neat!  The S feels too distant from the T to me.  There are some challenging
    forms here.

  body: I think the first name looks tighter overall than the second.  Look at IE
    vs. IC.  Also compare EL with CK - similar challenges there.

  body: 'I think you''re right, thanks. The E''s are much narrower than the C + K
    also, which doesn''t help. Wondering whether to try and stretch them out slightly. '

  body: "apul. Firstly, nice letterforms. Really nice.\r\n\r\nI agree with you guys,
    Stickland is feeling a lot more spacious than Ellie. I would think about opening
    Ellie up a bit rather than trying to play around with Stickland."

  body: I'm also seeing some weight issues, especially the diagonal on the N looks
    too dark.

  body: Have you considered making L & T a bit wider?  I suppose you looked at ITC
    Busorama for some inspiration?

    wider - thanks Luma. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logotype_kerncheck_edit3_4080.jpg]
