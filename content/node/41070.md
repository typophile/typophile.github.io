  using for example the following code.\r\n\r\nfeature zero {\r\n  sub zero by zeroalt;\r\n}
  zero;\r\n\r\nSo I' making extra characters by adding an -alt suffix. For example
  \"zero\" becomes zeroalt.\r\nSo far so good. But my question is the following: What
  do I do with the Unicode of these new characters?\r\nThe Unicode for \"zero\" is
  \"0030\" but I can't put my alternate \"zero\" at \"0031\" because that's taken
  by \"one\".\r\nWhat are some possible unicode solutions for \"zeroalt\"? And is
  a uncode necessary for these alternates?\r\n\r\nthx"

  body: "<em>And is a unicode necessary for these alternates?</em>\r\n\r\nyes and
    no. adobe recommends you not encode alternate glyphs, but then typical users (using
    MS Office) will not be able to access alternate glyphs at all (unless they have
    more sophisticated applications such as Adobe CS apps.) This is the route I would
    probably go. if you want to give these glyphs unicode encoding, use the Private
    Use Area slots. In FontLab you can assign all your unencoded glyphs at once by
    choosing Glyph > Glyph Names > Generate Unicode > Assign PUA indexes to unencoded
    glyphs."

  body: "thx Paul for the quick answer. \r\n\r\nIt's a font for a kind of digital
    private press. So office isn't that big of an issue. But I'll guess I'll encode
    them anyway if there's a private use area in unicode."

  body: "If any of the documents you set will have a use beyond that original printing,
    (e.g., pulling text from a PDF file, etc.), I suggest you also name those characters
    zero.alt, one.alt, etc. Any program based on *names* (like a PDF) isn't going
    to understand \"zeroalt\". But the Adobe convention is that everything after the
    period drops out, so \"zero.alt\" would extract as \"zero\" and the text would
    be useful.\r\n\r\nPrivate use also comes with some penalties -- any character
    so encoded has a meaning only in a particular font.\r\n\r\nIf you can access characters
    without a Unicode index, as with InDesign,  the best practice would be to name
    the alternative characters \"zero.alt\" , give them no Unicode index, and use
    OT features to access them. That way, the text in the original document is preserved.\r\n\r\nFWIW

  body: 'Also, in the event there is more than one alternate for a character, and
    you have no more descriptive suffixes than .alt (such as you might for language-specific
    variants or oldstyle figures) use zero padded number extensions, such as: zero.alt01,
    zero.alt02, &c. Two digits will allow the option of up to one hundred variants,
    though the only reason I can think you would need that many is if you inserted
    a random number generator into your substitution script, which could be a fun
    experiment but not terribly useful generally.'
