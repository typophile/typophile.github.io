  examples? I am so stuck on these... ggggrrrr...\r\n\r\nI know some may be Helvetica,
  but if you could simply just name the font against the image or filename that would
  be so helpful for me. Number 5. in particular has a few different fonts which I
  would like to know.\r\n\r\nAlso, for print design and letterpress, which combination
  of fonts is best for headings and general content?\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance,\r\nRS"
