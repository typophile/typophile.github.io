  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, <BR> <BR>I'm redesigning a printed ballot for the Vancouver municipal elections as part of my communication design senior project at ECIAD. <BR> <BR>I'm looking for something with some or all of the following characteristics: <BR> <BR>- high short-burst legibility <BR>- family of weights, widths if possible <BR>- letter-forms with visible differences from character to character to help with dyslexic/ESL reading <BR>  (opposite of prokyon, univers, helvetica?) <BR>- confidence with a little character and warmth <BR>- contemporary feeling <BR>- good optical characteristics at various sizes <BR>- efficient character count (high x-height &amp; condensed available?) <BR>- perhaps suitable for voting instructions, signage, etc <BR> <BR>A lot to ask, I know. The final choice will obviously be a compromise on one area vs. another. All suggestions of any kind are greatly appreciated! <BR> <BR>Thanks very much.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think you'll find anything that is specifically well optimized for dyslexic/non-Latin readers, which also comes in a large family of weights and widths. <BR> <BR>I'll also note that legibility and efficient character count (including condensed widths) are largely opposed to each other. Newspaper text faces try to walk that line, but they are also optimized for small sizes and don't meet the rest of your needs. <BR> <BR>Overall, I'm thinking something in the same general design space as Myriad or Frutiger would seem best suited to the job. Humanist sans, pretty legible, available in a wide range of weights and widths. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rrrrrr. <BR> <BR>Resist the impulse to default to sans. I still say Trinité. It has the condensed and extended widths you require, it has the  multiple available extender lengths you require, it's superbly legible, it certainly fills your need for &quot;confidence with a little character and warmth,&quot; need I go on? <BR> <BR>Other TEFF fonts are designed in similarly versatile ways (see also Lexicon.) The closest Adobe font I can think of is Kepler. Many would dismiss it because of its modern serif tendencies, but I think it's a fine and versatile design, perfectly legible, and certainly not overexposed. <BR> <BR>Step away from the sans!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Generally I don't like sans fonts, but for careful, deliberate reading at small sizes they're better than serif fonts. The problem is <i>most</i> sans fonts are more modular (hence more ambiguous) than the typical serif face. I think the ideal here would be a sans that's &quot;quirky&quot; - in the right ways though. One font I might recommend is Burke's Pragma*. And if you go with sans, maybe his FF Parable. <BR> <BR>* <a href="http://www.hiberniatype.com/Pragma/pragma.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.hiberniatype.com/Pragma/pragma.html">http://www.hiberniatype.com/Pragma/pragma.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>Also, stay away from highly chirographic* fonts: although they're not as bad as geometrically constructed designs, they're still too formally modular - it's just a less obvious modularity. Look at the b/d/p/q in your average chirographic font: the bowls are too similar. Good for aesthetic harmony, bad for reading. <BR> <BR>* Which is a term meaning a design that exhibits the vestiges of handwriting/calligraphy. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This may sound obvious, but i do know my faces pretty well: <BR> <BR>that description sounds like the brief for FF Meta, when i first designed it for the German post office as PT 55 back in 1985. It now even has a condensed version, and it was designed for very small sizes on bad paper with low-res typesetting. It's human, it's warm, it's a Sans. OK, it's overused, but aren't the Frutigers and Myriads even more so?</div>
