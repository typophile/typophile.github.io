  body: Well, as far as tag-style scripts go, it's not too bad, innit? Plus in a situation
    where the client really wants <em>that</em> specific font, you sometimes don't
    have much of a choice. ;^)

  body: "True, but I always prefer hand-lettering for this sort of style, unless (God
    forbid) a lot of text has to be set or the font has a ton of OT ligs and alternates.
    Just look at the two 'T's in a row in the logo above and you'll see why.\r\n\r\nI
    find that a nice stencil face with paint drips and overspray can convey a hip-hop
    vibe just as well as a \"tag\" style font.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
