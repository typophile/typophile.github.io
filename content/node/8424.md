body: I&#39;m planning a design/layout makeover for a security and defence policy
  magazine. 58 pages approx, full color, pictures; &#34;Neewsweek format&#34;. <BR>
  <BR>Open for suggestions for font combinations for body text and headings. As for
  the body text font is concerned, readability is important of course, but it must
  not be too gray or conservative. And it&#39;s definately good if it came in a range
  of variations, such as thin/normal/semibold/bold, condendensed/narrow, etc. <BR>
  <BR>When it comes to the sans serif for headings and small articles, I&#39;m quite
  fond of Helvetica New. Would that be a very bad choice &#40;I mean, is it too boring?&#41;
  I like the Frutiger too, though. <BR> <BR>Suggestions? Advices? Thanks in advance!

  body: 'Frutiger and Helvetica are solid but boring. They&#39;ve been used, used
    and used again. <BR> <BR>If I was in you&#39;re shoes, I&#39;d look at Farnham
    as a serif, and FF Bau  or FF Super Grotesk B as sans options. <BR> <BR>Farnham,
    recently released from exclusivity by Font Bureau, is a lively serif that won&#39;t
    alarm a conservative audience, but looks like it would a lot of fun to work with.
    You could use it for display purposes, too. <BR> <BR>FF Bau and FF Super Grotesk
    B &#40;note the B: it&#39;s the version with the two-story a and g&#41; offer
    more interest and character than Helvetica, and their liveliness, especially in
    the bold and black weights, would match Farnham&#39;s &#34;exuberance,&#34; as
    the Font Bureau site puts it. <BR> <BR>You might consider adding a slab serif
    to the mix for display purposes. Since you&#39;d be using it sparingly, as a spice
    rather than a main ingredient, something a little quirky, like Oxtail &#40;from
    PsyOps&#41;, might work.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Farnham"

  body: William, I&#39;m quite fond of Helvetica Neue as well. If you decide to go
    with Frutiger instead, take a look at Frutiger Next, a revised version of the
    family released a few years ago. It includes, amoung other things, a true italic
    &#40;instead of the old <i>obliques</i>&#41;. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/53781/frutigernext-family.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com/53781/frutigernext-family.html</a> <BR>
    <BR>Another interesting headline option, if you like Frutiger&#39;s work, is the
    new version of Avenir that Adrian Frutiger created last year with Akira Kobayashi,
    Avenir Next. This version of Avenir is far superior to the original 1988 release.
    It has a better family system &#40;more clear differentiation of the various weights&#41;,
    condensed weights, small caps, and old style as well as lining figures. Plus,
    it is available in OpenType format. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html"

    <BR>For the body text, I recommend Sabon Next, which was designed by one of Typophile&#39;s
    best contributors, Jean Fran

  body: Thank you for good suggestions, Marc, Stefan, and Dan! <BR> <BR>Marc, <BR>Farnham
    was a very good idea! So was FF Bau and FF Super Grotesk B, but after having tested,
    it seems to me that these two font packages don&#39;t comprise Latin-1 characters
    and special characters. That&#39;s really sad, because the two, the FF Super Grotesk
    B in particular, had that something &#34;extra&#34;. In fact they would have been
    my first choice. :-&#40; <BR> <BR>Dan, <BR>I must say I like the Avenir Next,
    too. It sails up as one of my personal favorites right now. But is the Avenir
    Next Italic a true italic? Sabon Next is a font that many have recommended to
    me. The big &#34;risk&#34; - to put it that way - is that it may be too similar
    to Garamond? Anyway, I will definately consider it! <BR> <BR>Stefan, <BR>as I
    write this, it seems to me that the Mac Rhino website is down. They had problems
    when I tried to access their site earlier today, too, so I have not had the oportunity
    to take a closer look on their fonts. <BR> <BR>Stefan, Dan, and Marc, <BR>Thanks
    again. So far. <BR> <BR> <BR>WW

  body: Glad the suggestions were useful, William.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure what
    you mean about &#34;Latin-1 and special characters,&#34; but before you give up,
    contact the folks at FontShop to see if there&#39;s a version of the font that
    would work.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve spoken with people at FontShop USA and FontShop
    Canada and they&#39;ve always been very helpful.

  body: William, Avenir Next&#39;s italic is an oblique, not a true italic &#40;come
    to think of it, many of Frutiger&#39;s typefaces use obliques; I wonder if that
    is his personal preference&#41;. If you are worried about Sabon Next being too
    Garamondy, take a look at the original Sabon &#40;also available through Linotype
    &amp; other distributors
