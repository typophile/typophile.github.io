  body: hmm, yeah, it looks close.  too bad the foundry site does not show a more
    complete alphabet to compare to, I don't own this font so can't check it more
    closely.  are there any other fonts similar to this.  i might just have to re-do
    this with a new typeface that "close enough".  thanks for the help, that was fast!  :)
