  body: "The text is \"\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062D\u062F\u06CC\u0646\"? Does it
    have a Roman transliteration (like the png that you attached)?\r\nAnd how does
    it translate into English, if you don't mind?"

    think the translation would be something like \"the unifiers\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
