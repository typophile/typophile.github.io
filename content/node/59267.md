  body: "These are not the most revealing letters, although the E is key. I think
    you could get very close to this with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/clarendon/|Bitstream
    Clarendon]], either by flattening the condensed Bold or squooshing (TM) the Bold
    or Black to make them narrower.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: If so I'd search in the general direction of Cheltenham (although the logo
    might well be custom); the TUBORG logo seems close to it, and it seems like they've
    used it for some sub-brands too (as in the Danish <em>Julebryg</em>, see large
    JPG <a href="http://www.carlsbergdanmark.dk/Produkter/PublishingImages/High-res/Tuborg%20Julebryg%201%20stk_.jpg">here</a>).

  body: I thought I had seen the font in the "Typecasting" blog entry, but it actually
    isn't either Aachen or (a bold weight of) Memphis.

  body: "Certainly not.\r\n\r\nRe my suspicion above, I should maybe clarify that
    in Icelandic, \"L\xE9tt\xF6l\" means \"Light Beer\". I still think it looks a
    lot like the Tuborg logo font."
