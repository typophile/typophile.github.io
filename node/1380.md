body: Hi there, <BR> <BR>Does anyone know if it is possible, once you have set up
  your guides in InDesign, to edit them all together, say move all the guides 5pt
  to the right? <BR> <BR>It would seem handy to me... <BR> <BR>Cheers

  body: Yes, it&#39;s not too difficult. Unlock the guides, and then set the increment
    of your arrow keys to the desired distance &#40;5pt&#41;. Select guides with selection
    tool&#40;s&#41;; depress the shift key to select multiple guides. Then, use the
    keyboard arrow keys to move the guides. Voila!
