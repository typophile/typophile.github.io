body: "When placing a caption beside body copy what is the general rule of thumb?
  Should they both have the same leading? For example, my body copy is 7pt with 9pt
  leading should I set the caption to 6pt with 9pt leading? see attached sample. Thanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cap-size1_4414.jpg]"

  body: "I would use the leading that best suits the caption size, rather than try
    to align the captions and the text on the same baseline grid. \r\nHere's why:
    The captions should have a stronger visual connection to the art or photos they
    describe than to the adjacent text column. Also, I would want the flexibility
    to scale and crop art and photos however they work best. I wouldn't want to have
    to scale or crop them to line up with the text baseline grid, just for the sake
    of aligning the captions. "

    every three of its lines would align with every two of the main text.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
