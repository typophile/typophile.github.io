body: I use fontlab 4.5.1 on osx. I have a problem with the  <BR>preview window and
  the &#39;@&#39; glyph. Whenever I have <BR>the @ glyph previewing, it shows whatever
  is in the <BR>glyph window instead of what is actually in the cell. <BR>Does anybody
  have a solution or have the same  <BR>problem?

  body: This is a feature. The @ sign is a wildcard, which shows the currently selected
    glyph. This is very useful because you can build a small set of preview strings
    to check any glyph in particular contexts, e.g. <a href="mailto:nn@nn">nn@nn</a>
    and <a href="mailto:oo@oo">oo@oo</a> for basic spacing tests. <BR> <BR>If you
    need to display the @ sign in the preview window, use the convention /at . The
    slash is an escape character in preview strings after which you can identify a
    glyph by its name. <BR> <BR>You can also use the convention &#92;XXXX in which
    the variable is a Unicode character hex value.

  body: That&#39;s not a problem, that&#39;s a feature. That&#39;s what the @  <BR>character
    does in the preview panel. If you want to see the  <BR>@ character, and not what&#39;s
    in the glyph window, type &#34;/at&#34;.  <BR>You can do this for any character
    that can&#39;t easily be typed  <BR>or can&#39;t be typed at all. Just type a
    slash followed by the  <BR>name of the character. You may need to type a space
    after  <BR>depending on what follows.
