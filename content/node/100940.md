  body: "I think this has been posted here before for an ID, not sure if it was successful
    then. I presume it is the band name you\u2019re looking to have identified? I
    strongly suspect that it\u2019s simple customisation, with certain elements added
    and deleted from the original glyphs."

    hours of looking!\r\n\r\nIt looks like this font - http://www.dafont.com/futurist-fixed.font?fpp=50&text=ALVAREZ+KINGS\r\n\r\nBut
    like you say, with customisation."

    directly); other than the obvious difference of the |S| I doubt anyone making
    these sorts of customisations would modify the |K| in this way."
