    than the specimen I have (ITC Typeface Collection, 1980 -- the BIG BLACK BOOK).\r\n\r\n(edit-a-bit-more):
    I have not found a digitized version, though at one point pre-digital I believe
    there was a look-alike named Florence (the city which is known as \"Firenze\"
    to Italians)."

  body: Looking at your sample of "solar arkestra" it looks like some of the characters
    were condensed a bit... the uppercase E for example. Which might account for why
    the original ampersand is narrower and almost closed like your sample.

    thing for my post on <a href=\"http://typographi.com/001062.php\">Threadless fonts</a>.
    There was a version of Firenze offered by Image Club but it has since gone \"out
    of print\", as it were. Ask Monotype about that, I guess. In the meantime, I offered
    some alternatives in my Typographica post."
