  font in a way, just-for-learn fontlab and I have all my basic glyphs in a THIN weight.
  Now I want to do the complete family! kind a dream... I see via Actions you can
  BOLD a font, BOLD + Round but I never figure out how to automatically Italic a font...
  Any ideas? \r\n\r\nMuch appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance "

    the strokes, and narrow the width of the letters and their metrics. All of this
    can be done pretty quickly using Karsten Lucke\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.logofontandlettering.com/bookorder.html\">KLTF
    Glyph Transformer</a>. I just tried it out and it took me about thirty seconds
    to figure out how to do it. Of course, you\u2019ll still need to redraw characters
    like a, e, g, and f that have different italic forms. "
