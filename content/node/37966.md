  job. This is one bunch of prototypes (all the same main idea), utilising my initals
  (\xD3S\xD3). I like the fact that it's also an ambigram, but generally I don't think
  they really work. Any ideas? Or should I just pursue another direction altogether?\r\n\r\nOh
  yeah, you can just ignore the text in the lower right corner - I was just playing
  around drawing some letterforms on a grid. I might try and take that somewhere though,
  if this ambigram logo refuses to work.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/osologo_5769.jpg]"

  body: "I think it's actually pretty striking.  I'd keep working on it.  I see a
    pair of eyes and even a bit of an infinity loop.  When you've been given good
    initials to work with, sometimes you just need to go with it.  \r\n\r\nI would
    work them out in black and white first before delving into color, as that sometimes
    obscures your focus on the form.  If I had to pick one, I'd say version 1.  I'd
    like to see 1a and 1b out of the containing shape, though.  You get a fairly interesting
    footprint created by the forms that is lost when you put it in the shape.  \r\n\r\nThe
    only section that feels a little awkward to me is the very middle connection between
    the top right and bottom left arc.  You might need to fudge the geometry a bit
    to make it feel right.  Sometimes optically right is better than purely geometrically
    right, if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nKeep going."

  body: "Thanks for the input!\r\n\r\nThe curves of #1 are probably a bit sloppy,
    that's the only one I drew with the pen tool - the rest were done with concentric
    circles and liberal amounts of Pathfinder operations.\r\n\r\nThe idea with the
    bounding box was originally to try and use the negative space to assemble the
    logo, but it didn't work out so well, so I ended up extending the box. What irritated
    me about 1 and 2 was the abrubt cut-off on the sides, hence the revised versions.
    But I'll work on this a bit more. Appreciate the tips.\r\n\r\nFunny you should
    mention a pair of eyes, though, as I've been using this silly mark to sign my
    pencil drawings for some time now (excuse the crappy digital photo crop, no scanner
    nearby at the moment):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ososign_5394.jpg]"
