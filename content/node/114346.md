  body: "Because that makes it less a \"C\".\r\n\r\nLet's look at each one of those
    four:\r\n- The first looks like a Devanagari \"s\" with an exotic accent. Nice
    logo for a yoga studio in Szczecin...\r\n- The second is pretty much a \"C\" in
    smaller sizes.\r\n- The third is fine, if ugly.\r\n- The fourth is totally unfamiliar
    to many people. And hopefully will be to everybody eventually.\r\n\r\nOf course
    context make a lot of difference, but the basis remains. \r\n\r\nAll that said
    however, it was probably better to say \"better\" instead of \"good\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    meets a different need, only one  has a strong horizontal bar.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ThirdManInGodWeTrust_4093.jpg]\r\nA
    sans based on the lettering on the  Criterion DVD cover for THE THIRD MAN. Clearly
    it does not say that we trust in a codfish.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UnderwoodChampionGroves_3531.jpg]\r\nMillions
    of words were typed in this font on the Underwood Champion Typewriter in WWII.
    A thin monoline Roman with unambiguous letters that remain quite legible even
    when read in the blurred fifth carbon copy page. Comments I have seen say the
    font looks more attractive than other typewriter fonts.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PalmerRevised_5416.jpg]\r\nMillions
    of North American schoolchildren were taught cursive writing based on variations
    of the Palmer System of handwriting. This one is standardized to enable consistent
    linking of the letters.\r\nI doubt that middle G the only one that is a candidate
    for being a \"good\" G.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: 'The horizontal stroke on a G is like the horizontal stroke on a J: although
    it makes a bigger difference its not needed for disambiguation or increased legibility.
    The classic pattern (= the basic structural model) is in both cases: no hor. stroke.'

  body: "First, I truly disagree with Hrant's assessment of the the three Gs  I posted
    a couple of days ago. In my view each is a \"good\" G in the context of the font
    in which they appear -- unambiguously a G even in the black sans, which would
    be used only at titling/display sizes.\r\nSecond, I do have a G to offer that
    I consider to be a \"bad\" G. Unless one is an expert in this particular style
    of typography -- Fraktur -- there is little to guide the reader to recognize which
    letter is a G, rather than an E, S or C:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FetteFrakturSGFC_6425.jpg]\r\nSo
    dear reader, I invite you to play the game of \"find the G.\" Also, for that matter,
    the E, S, and C.\r\nBTW I clearly recall this problem from when I was learning
    to read Fraktur -- I had to tell them apart mainly by context.\r\nDon"
