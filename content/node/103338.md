  luck at Bowfin, where I flipped through \"formal connected scripts,\" Identifont,

  body: "Thanks. \r\nThis is indeed a version of the same font . My copy of French111
    is an old t1 with the notice \"Copyright 1990-1998 as an unpublished work by Bitstream
    Inc.\" I checked the character set at Myfonts and note that BT has not updated
    the font to include the German Z as an alternate.\r\nAnyway, it seems that the
    design predates the digital era.\r\nMyfonts says about Linotype Gando that it
    is \"The classical French Ronde, as it appears in the work of Nicholas Gando in
    the middle of the eighteenth century, adapted for photocomposition at Mergenthaler
    in 1970 by Hans Jurg Hunzicker and Matthew Carter. Typo Upright is similar.\"\r\nAs
    far as I can determine Linotype did not digitize it. A search at the Linotype
    website produces an offer of the BT font. Similarly Myfonts does not sell Gando
    and a search leads only back to French 111.\r\nAs for the Decca image, I can only
    guess at the source of the Z. Presumably it is  from a digital source.\r\nBowfin
    & Identifont did not add anything.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think Gando Ronde might be seen as the Linotype-version of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/typo-upright/|ATF\u2019s
    Typo Upright]] It has to be noticed though that the upright French Ronde has been
    rather popular in Germany in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Seemann\u2019s
    \u2018Handbuch der Schriftarten\u2019 from 1926 lists eight German foundries such
    as Berthold, Stempel and Bauersche Gie\xDFerei that sell a \u2018Rundschrift\u2019
    (round script). The design is credited with W. Woellmer (a typefounder/typefoundry
    in Berlin), 1860.\r\n\r\nNote that, unlike in Gando or Typo Upright, the \u2018i\u2019
    in \u2018Die\u2019 tilts to the left \u2026 not very Germanic I\u2019d say!"

  body: "Thanks for the book reference -- I'll see if I can find a copy -- and the
    designer credit.\r\nAs for the tilt to the left of \"i\" in the sample, you are
    correct that it does not tilt left in the BT digital Gando. Indeed, the BT version
    clearly tilts to the right. \r\nHere is Gando's \"i\" as displayed in Jaspert's
    Encylopedia of 1970, presumably the metal font:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hij@GandoRondeLC@Jaspert1970__3647.jpg]\r\nAnd
    here is the photocomposition version prepared for Mergenthaler by Hans Jurg Hunzicker
    and Matthew Carter in 1970, as displayed in Rookledge's Interational Typefinder:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hij@GandoRonde@Rookledge1983__4013.jpg]\r\nI
    don't see a tilt to the right of either the metal and photocomposition versions
    to quite the same degree as the BT version.  Nor do they tilt to the left as shown
    in the  Zauberfl\xF6te sample. \r\nThis almost suggests that despite the 2012
    release date of the DVD the sample was made in the old way, from a set of photocomposition
    transfer letters and there was a lack of attention in pasting the \"i\". This
    may also explain the source of the Germanic Z as a Germanized set of transfer
    sheets. But I have no way of knowing any of this.\r\n \r\nDon"
