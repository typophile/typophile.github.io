  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, sorry if I am beating a dead horse here but I didn't find anything recent on this question.

But I am looking for a good type manager for windows with out having to spend to much, or none at all :P

I tried a free trial of a software I can't for the life of me remember the name of, but it was horrible.

I am a fan of extensis on my mac at work but don't have that budget at home.

Any suggetions? Also using vista (64 bit) if that matters.

cheers

That's what all the font management programs do. They either add a copy or a link the fonts when you activate them in the system folder, then when you deactivate it deletes the copy/link. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes but this application did not reset itself say like suitcase. Without keeping a record of which fonts you had installed and then going back and manually deleting these files, thy would become a permanent file in the system font folder, which bloated my system fonts on a day to day basis.


Yes I could keep better record of which I had "installed"  but when I would accopy over several fonts in a design session I just don't seem to remember them all.

Anyway, guess I will just start saving for suitcase, as I am comfortable with it.

This is only partly true. When modern font managers like Suitcase activate a font on Windows, they do so programmatically by modifying one of two different registry keys depending on the font type. If you look at C:\Windows\Fonts\ it will appear as though the directory contains shortcuts. This is the way Microsoft has chosen to represent the Windows font system. The fonts folder, though, is not a normal directory. The only way files can be added to it are though the Add Fonts dialog. So, the "shortcuts" are really created by Windows to represent the state of the font system, which is reasonable. After a font is added, other API calls are made to update the system and tell Windows to refresh the font menus of open applications. 

This has varied somewhat over time as well. My understanding is that Suitcase 9.x did in fact do something similar to creating a shortcut. Suitcase 11 (Windows) does use the method I've described however.

On the Mac OS X side, there has always been a robust programming interface for font activation. As far as I know, nothing like a shortcut has ever been used.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Trick, I recommed trying High-Logic MainType. You'll find more info and trial at http://www.high-logic.com/maintype.html .
It should run OK on 64-bit Vista.

MainType is 49 USD but is currently up at a 50% discount on the discounts still availabe list over at: http://www.donationcoder.com/.
You need to become a donating member in order to get the discount (but any donation will do).
 
MainType has been up at: http://www.bitsdujour.com at a 60 % discount and it seems it will be again on 16 June 08: http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/maintype/.

Trial MainType, add your mail addy to: http://www.bitsdujour.com/software/maintype/notify/ and you should be able to get MainType at a bargain price just a couple of days before the trial period ends.

BTW, I'm in no way affiliated with Hig-Logic, but I've tried all font managers for Windows, bought a few, and have fond myself using MainType only.

It's perfectly acceptable in the States too. There's a difference in meaning (verb aspect, in this case) between the "preterite" (completed action) and the "present perfect" (something occurring in past that continues or relates to present) that works mostly the same, so far as I know, in both American and British standards of English. In this case, the latter verb form is useful to imply that the toaster still does not work.</div>
