  font but I&#39;ve looked everywhere and can&#39;t find it. If anyone knows the answer
  I would be grateful...  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/mf_private.WTFImages/000000633ecbf71c0006557700003744.jpg"

    been? &#40;major places&#41; <BR> <BR>did you already check Identikal collection
    // t26 // larabie&#39;s neuropol // <BR>angus shamal&#39;s collection // test
    pilot collective // <BR> <BR>myfonts and DA FONT, the freeware mecca... <BR> <BR>and
    what country is the sample from...Down Under. <BR> <BR>Also, there&#39;s a chance
    that it&#39;s custom. <BR> <BR>it&#39;s a quickie, with a cloned a/e. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: Yes, the a, e looks like larabie&#39;s Saved by Zero, while the t and d looks
    like it could be modified from Zero Threes, also by larabie. Both fonts <a href="http://www.dafont.com/search.php?nq=1&amp;q=zero"
    target="_blank">here</a>. <BR>But I assume you are obsessing about finding the
    EXACT match, right? Since it has been bothering you for a while?

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I am not so familiar with the freeware/shareware font
    world as you folks but I checked out places like abstractfonts.com, 1001fonts.com,
    highfonts.com - those kind of places. I have run it through What The Font and
    the MyFonts.com forum &#40;no-one picked it&#41; and I have looked in every catalogue
    such as T-26 and House Industries that I can lay hands on. The font is unusual
    and for some reason I really like it. I want to use it on a logo if I find it.

  body: whoa - Saved By Zero is close isn&#39;t it &#40;but no lower case&#41;. I
    am not sure where the &#39;Latitude&#39; sample is from. To be honest - a client
    asked me to ID it for them and I have been looking ever since!

    that summer vacation is over, my font browsing time is limited to the evenings.  I&#39;ll
    see what I can find. <BR> <BR>And really, Cheshire Dave is much better than me
    anyway.

    is similar.

  body: Thanks Lisa P and everyone. I have come to the conclusion that it is a commissioned
    logo font. I have done more research and the logo appears on this website <a href="http://www.latitudetower.com.au"
    target="_blank">http://www.latitudetower.com.au</a> and their corporate font is
    Digital Sans. I therefore think the &#34;Latitude&#34; logo is an altered version
    of Digital Sans. Anyone agree there?

  body: Quite possible. Also, this type design is very easy to  <BR>emulate &#40;geometric
    design, straight lines, quarter  <BR>circle curves, no optical corrections&#41;,
    so if you want  <BR>more characters it won&#39;t be too hard to draw them  <BR>yourself.

    Designers&#39; Republic</a> used for <a href="http://www.platipus.com">Platipus
    Records</a>. <BR> <BR>Although the &#39;t&#39; doesn&#39;t line up in the Latitude
    logo, whereas it does for Platipus, and also the aspect seems a little different.
    Sadly, I don&#39;t have any of my Platipus releases on hand to check properly,
    only those nasty jpegs on the Platipus site. <BR> <BR>Personally I prefer the
    TDR version!
