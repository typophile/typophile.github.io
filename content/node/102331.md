body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a little problem with a font I am generating. When I am
  in fontlab the A glyph is at the right place with the right OT number. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture
  d\u2019\xE9cran 2013-04-16 \xE0 23_5156.02.33.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut as soon as I generate
  it the A glyph moves in my window glyph to the end of the list and when I use the
  glyph window in Illustrator (or any other soft) the A glyph is not next to the B.

  body: "There seems to be a mis-match between Unicode sorting order (top window)
    and Glyph order (Illustrator's Glyph panel). In InDesign, you can toggle between
    the two -- a feature I have used to my advantage.\r\nLook in the FontLab View
    menu for an item called \"Sort order\" (it supports many)."

  body: "When you say \"sort order\" (which I could not find in the view menu. Do
    you mean the \"123\" button on top of the glyphs window ? Because my glyphs are
    already in order. The thing is that everything is in place but when I am generating
    the font, Fontlab move my A to end of the list in the OTF file. I can figure out
    why :-(\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/717823Capturedcran20130417090912.jpg\"

  body: "OK my mistake. I didn't look in the right place :)\r\nIn glyph menu there
    is the submenu to sort glyphs by name or by unicode.\r\nUsing this order put everything
    back in place.\r\nThanks very much !!!"
