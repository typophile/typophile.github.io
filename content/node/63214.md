  body: 'Chase: The images you''ve provided were probably not printed using the same
    font. The general category under which those designs fall is Old Style. (Although
    1 or 2 of them may be Transitional). I don''t know Type history as well as many
    of the other folks on these forums, but I''d wager that your sample from Common
    Sense was printed with a font of Caslon.'
