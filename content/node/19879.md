  body: There was a tidal wave of homemade grunge fonts in the 90's. Many of them
    where shareware/freeware, this could have been one of those. A lot of them have
    since been taken off the market as the designers have gotten better, and the hobbyists
    have moved on to other things.

  body: There are many fonts that mimic tape labelers. You can get a similar look
    from taking <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.2961.2.8">FF
    Dyanamoe</a> and reversing it.
