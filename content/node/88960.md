body: "Curious if anyone has read this new book, \"Type Navigator\" by Jan Middendorp.
  I loved his history of design in Den Haag (\"HA,\"), and of course the amazing \"Dutch
  Type\" book from 010 publishers.\r\n\r\n [[http://usshop.gestalten.com/books/new/type-navigator.html|Here's
  some more info]]. \r\n\r\nAlso, what's up with that CDROM? 100 typefaces? Are those
  just visual references or am I smelling some kinda deal here...(shameless, I know).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Participants were asked to provide fonts and information for the specimen
    pages.\r\nHaving fonts on the CD was optional, with participants choosing which.\r\n(Disclaimer:
    Shinntype is included in the book, but we declined to put fonts on the CD; I don\u2019t
    recall why.)\r\n\r\nThis kind of arrangement is similar to <em>Indie Fonts</em>,
    although in that publication participants also created editorial pages (custom
    for an introductory page, and adapting a template for specimen pages), whereas
    in <em>Type Navigator</em> the design is entirely by the publisher.\r\n\r\nJan
    Middendorp\u2019s previous \u201Cfoundry compilation\u201D book, <em>Creative
    Characters</em>, has no bonus font CD."

  body: I also love the book Dutch Type and therefore, I bought the book Type Navigator.
    It gives a good overview of many small and independent foundries. Even though
    I thought I know many foundries, it is impressive to see the variety of fresh
    new fonts. I really recommend buying this book.
