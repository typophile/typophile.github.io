body: "I'm making tentative steps towards designing my first typeface and I've been
  thinking about vertical metrics.\r\n\r\nWhat should be accounted for within the
  height of the em square? My instinct is that it would be a tidy solution to allow
  space for the height of diacritical marks within the em to avoid clipping / crashing,
  but I can see a number of disadvantages too.\r\n\r\n<strong>Advantages</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A
  degree of future proofing if extending into other character sets. No need to break
  backwards compatibility of vertical metrics.</li>\r\n<li>Assuming the em square
  retains a fraction of space at the top and bottom, solid setting wouldn't cause
  crashes.</li>\r\n<li>Possibly simplifies the setting of vertical metrics values?
  I still need to fully read John Hudson's wiki entry on this.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Disadvantages</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The
  result will be 'small on the body' making the apparent size smaller for a given
  point size.</li>\r\n<li>The default linespacing (ie when set solid) becomes dependent
  on the tallest glyph + diacritical combination (Would this be Aringacute? http://typophile.com/node/35221).</li>\r\n<li>As
  a result of the above, a text using no diacritics may need negative leading.</li>
  \r\n<li>Mixing typefaces within the same line may be problematic.</li>\r\n<li>Reduces
  the effective vertical resolution for placing points.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI remember
  a thread which compared the 'size on the body' of recent Microsoft type families
  to that of older ones such as Arial, and found the new releases were significantly
  'smaller on the body'. Has there been a move in this direction for other designers
  / foundries, or is it one of those personal preferences which splits opinion?"

    acute \u2014 put the acute accent to the right of the ring.\r\n\r\n2. Use low
    profile diacritics for uppercase glyphs, that is slant them less.\r\n"

  body: "No need for Aring acute, unless you expect publishers of Danish dictionaries
    to license your font.\r\n\r\nBut they will no doubt require fonts including IPA
    (phonetic) symbols, so unless you plan to also include *those* Unicode glyphs,
    you are wasting your time on this character.\r\n"

  body: "Chris, your doubt was also mine when I begun to develop my font.\r\n\r\nThe
    solution I did adopt was to set height limits according to <strong>single</strong>
    accent above and below, plus a small extra space. I also followed Bhikku's second
    suggestion so my diacritics are different for each set of glyphs (lowercase, uppercase,
    small caps, petite caps).\r\n\r\nAbout characters with <strong>double</strong>
    accents, I built them preserving design and exceeded the height limits. This would
    cause collisions between lines, but I believe that people who use languages with
    these glyphs, like Vietnamese, are familiar with this problem and already use
    larger leadings."
