		<div class="commentbody">Looking at the PDF, my only problem is that you're using both <BR>totally sharp corners and slightly rounded corners: discord. <BR> <BR>Linguistics: The Latin alphabet (when used for most languages, and particularly English) uses the vertical Cartesian space in different proportions in terms of ascender, x-height and descenders. The x-height conveys the greatest chunk of information to the reader, and the descenders almost nothing. You still have to balance that against the importance of diverging boumas, but irrespective of the proportion you give to the x-height/ascender ratio, the descenders have to be notably shorter than the ascenders.

It looks a bit dark there, and might clog up a bit at smaller sizes, or at least muddy up a bit. That might help alleviate the &quot;flat tire&quot; look that Kris mentioned. <BR> <BR>I'd also apply the same aesthetic that you applied to &quot;hamb&quot; above to all of the curves.

		<div class="commentbody">Apolline, Berkeley too. <BR> <BR>Anyway to answer to the question about asymetric in serifs: <BR>&quot;Is this treatment left over from a serif drawn in one   <BR>motion with a flat tipped pen?&quot; <BR> <BR>Yes, the form came from a study of the ductus produced by the broad edge pen when doing the terminals. But, as there is various interpretation how humanistic letters has been done at serif level, their his place for infinite variations. <BR> <BR>I like particular the &quot;ecce hereditas Domini&quot; typeface done by Noordzij as illustration of his essay called 'The truth about the serif&quot; published in letterletter dating back the end of the eighties for ATypI. <BR> <BR>You can access again to the reprint of his texts published in lettereletter in a book of the same title published by Hartley and Marks in 2000.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi All.  <BR> <BR>Here's a third version. I've done the spacing and some kerning. Also, I revisited the shapes. Previous versions still showed too much up and down movement &ndash; not enough horizonal. I've reworked the branches and bowls to give more emphasis to the horiz/vert. transition of the curve (see the diagram in the pdf &ndash; blue is old, black is new). In addition, I exaggerated the angle of the break to keep the character of the old sets despite the thicker horizontals. <BR> <BR>I'd love some of the experienced text folk to give me some feedback at this point. It seems much improved to me, but i value your opinions. <BR> <BR>Would you set long text in it? If not, why not. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Randy <BR> <BR><!--attachment: prodigal_3_0-16803.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*205.4*prodigal+3%2e0*prodigal%2e3%2e0%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">prodigal 3.0<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/prodigal_3_0-16803.pdf" target="_blank"><b>prodigal.3.0.pdf</b></a> (205.4 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's a good test, although somewhat predictable: assuming your printer isn't out of whack, outlines will gain half a pixel (on average, of course - since it's binary) in size when converted to outline. This is because of different rendering algorithms within Postscript - not smart, Adobe - unavoidable? <BR> <BR>On a 600 dpi laser outlines will gain twice as much as on a 1200, so the 12 comparison would be like your 6, and you'd have to go to 24 to get &quot;Very very slight&quot;. <BR> <BR>The best test would be somewhat subjective: figure out at what PPEM most people can't tell the difference between a real font and outlined text. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
