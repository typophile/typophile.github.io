  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">i&rsquo;m curious. after reading over Gerry&rsquo;s [[Greek|short history of the Greek script]], i want to know what the current trends are in Greece regarding the handling of their own script. i was doing some digging to reference the Gill Sans Hellenic, which was used for the 2004 Olympics in Athens and found <a href="http://www.fonts.gr/tryfonts/sample.asp?familyID=226">a sample on the Cannibal Fonts website</a>. i was a bit surprised, because as i quickly browsed through several of the type families on this site, most seemed very westernized to me, being highly geometric. however, if you look at faces produced here in the west, they seem to follow traditional models more closely, with the new ClearType fonts and Thomas' new <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/Hypatia%20text%20settings.pdf">Hypatia Sans</a> showing a lot more calligraphic flavor. which brings me to an actual question: do native Greeks prefer more westernized (geometric) or more traditional (calligraphic) for Greek extensions of western faces?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Greek Letters: from Tablets to Pixels&rdquo; is wonderful, but when it comes to current trends it&rsquo;s too old.</p>
<p>From my modest experience (basically talking to Greek type people in 2002 and 2004) they generally don&rsquo;t like the Latinized forms. The Western habit of relying heavily on chirography on the other hand is very old-fashioned, and any native who uses a computer is likely to like that even less (even though I personally think it&rsquo;s less bad). But they haven&rsquo;t been given many real alternatives to the two &ldquo;schools&rdquo;, so&hellip; The one recent Greek font I admire is Apollonia.</p>
<p>So Paul, if you could help, they&rsquo;d love you for decades.</p>

<p>it’s how that alphabet originated</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, not exactly. It came from the Phoenician, which was also angular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this face is no more nor less radical than Futura was to the Latin type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t make sense, considering the
precedent in one and the lack in the other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The design of Olympia addresses ithe issue of
modernism and tradition, latinization is irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two are strongly related.
Modernism is not a universal culture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t follow trends, make them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great advice. But for text face design, first you need
a firm grasp of readability. This applies to Latin too&hellip;</p>
<p>If you want to make something highly readable you either mimic
or you fathom. And you can&rsquo;t innovate properly without the latter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>take a look at Akira Kobayashi’s career for inspiration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What about talent?
Maybe (and this seems quite likely) Akira has more than average?</p>
<p>Another central thing is nativity: Japanese people for example are exposed to a lot of Latin when they&rsquo;re growing up, while Latin users don&rsquo;t see much besides Latin. Nativity is glossed over mostly by people who would suffer a drop in credibility by admitting they lack enough of it.</p>
<p>And Simon&rsquo;s advice is rock-solid.
Don&rsquo;t rely on souvlaki buddies too much&hellip;</p>

<p>By Western, do you mean American or European as well? Greece is an EU country and part of Western civilization so I am not sure you can separate the two. It seems to me that there were some ancient Greek mathematicians (Euclid and Pythagorus) who had something to do with Geometry as well :-)</p>

I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way. I was trying to indicate that Greece is an unusual case. Latin was initially Greconized so it is really a soup mix. Greece was also influenced by the Ottomans, the British, and now, Americans. What is authentic and pure Greek is a very fuzzy thing. Look at Hyphen 2006 and see what typeface it is set in? We live in a World more international in nature than ever. Purist nationalistic notions just don&rsquo;t have the sway that they used to. Unlike the pre digital era, Greeks can buy type anywhere in the world online. They have choices, they make choices just like the rest of the world. They are not stuck with what used to be on a Monotype hotmetal typesetter any more. This is a very interesting topic, Paul, and I had no intension of putting you in an uncomfortable place by trying to pin down Westernism. Personally, whatever Westernism used to be, is certainly something else now, thanks, in part, to the internet.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My opinion on the subject is based more on intuition and less on thorough research so I am going to be careful on what I say (it&rsquo;s the heart talking rather than the mind on this one).</p>
<p>I totally agree with Chris Lozos&rsquo;s position on the way modernist values have changed into something universal for almost all &ldquo;western societies&rdquo;. In fact some of the best works (imho) in greek poster design have been made during the 60s/70s by graphic designers like Michalis and Agni Katzouraki, and Freddy Karabott and were very much influenced by modernism.</p>
<p>So, yes Greece is most of the times a &ldquo;user&rdquo; and not an &ldquo;initiator&rdquo; (and when it comes to typography, that is the case), and, yes, Greece has for many years tried to decide whether it considers itself east or west. The thing is though that our (my) dilemma has now changed - and it&rsquo;s based on Chris&rsquo;s conclusion: we are able to purchase typefaces and get inspired by designs from all over the world. So, do we really need to think in terms of &ldquo;nationalistic&rdquo; or &ldquo;latinized&rdquo; or &ldquo;exoticized&rdquo; or whatever designs, rather than thinking in more universal terms.</p>
<p>Gerry Leonidas&rsquo;s analysis is truly detailed and correct. But in my opinion what is rather interesting to see is that Helvetica (and Helvetica-looking typefaces) has been the default in several applications in graphic design for a lot of years from the 60s up to the 90s, and then Meta and Din came and replaced it, and then (a few years ago) Myriad came and replaced them, and then (fewer years ago) Fedra came and conquered the contemporary greek typographic world. As you can see they are all contemporary and mainly geometric (instead of calligraphy based) typefaces. And then, in the book industry, Didot (like GFS&rsquo;s Didot), and Times were the default. And they never left the scene, only to find themselves occasionally replaced by Minion or Warnock (in the past few years).</p>
<p>So, what I am trying to pinpoint is that foreign (that is non-greek) typographic designers have now (and I guess always had) a &ldquo;power&rdquo; to lead the trends in greek typography without too much critique or even competition. And of course it&rsquo;s not them to blame (if there is anyone to blame). The think is that you can count the greeks that actually try to understand and thoroughly research the phenomenon called &ldquo;greek typography&rdquo; in your two hands. Their work is undoubtedly remarkable. But the educational and research gap is something that literally prevents upcoming greek designers to be critical when faced with an &ldquo;imported&rdquo; interpretation of the greek alphabet, let alone innovative when it comes to designing their own interpretations.</p>
<p>So, to conclude, for me there is no such thing as a preference towards traditional or geometric typographic forms in comtemporary Greece. There are just people trying to cope with constant change or mimicing imported norms. And there are fewer people trying to fathom how did we get here and (if they should/could) change it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My point concerning Futura vs Olympia is that the latter is qualitatively more progressive, less reliant on precedent; your equating of the two is non-sensical.</p>

<p>That’s not been my experience.</p>

<p>Nobody can expect you to see clearly within your own system. You can&rsquo;t easily know that your progressive text face is in fact a flop. In fact in your case when an expert tells you so, you choose to turn the tables in your hubris. You have to listen to and trust others to tell you what&rsquo;s most likely going on with your designs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you do your homework.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only a matter of homework. Formalism only covers half the ground, the rest is incommunicable, non-transferrable subconsiousness, nativity. It is known that the formative years of a person&rsquo;s childhood bestow certain affinities that cannot be gained later. It is known for example that children who learn two languages early on end up being fluent in both to a degree an adult can never attain.* Never. This is our biology, and you are no less human than any of us.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact early-bilingual people attain a different <cite>type</cite> of intelligence. In effect, their brains develop slightly differently. This is not shocking - in fact teenagers go through pronounced structural changes to their brains during puberty.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you simply cannot &ldquo;get&rdquo; it any more. It&rsquo;s too late.
Ignoring this reality is self-serving and possibly even dishonest.</p>

<p>Thank you George, that is exactly it in the nutshell. Greeks, or any of us anywhere, are not limited to what happens between here and the next village so designers do not confine their work to what was done in that bygone era. What is the value in reconstituting the past for everything we do? If past generations had done that, there would not be any typography today. Greeks were seaman and traders and explorers and invaders. They gathered from the foreign lands they saw and developed a culture and a language and an alphabet. If they took nothing from Phoenicians or Babylonians or Assyrians, perhaps that writing would never have come. The Romans borrowed from the Greeks, and later, the Greeks borrowed back. Mix in the Turks, and later the rest of Europe and you see what a conglomeration it was. This all took thousands of years by slow ships and by foot. Today, cultures blend in an instant. Today, what used to be the next village, is now the entire globe and at the speed of a T1 line.
Just think of having this conversation among us all, separated by thousands of miles. If we just did what our older culture had done, we would never know each-other.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey, that bump did in fact jolt my memory! I was meaning to add the following:</p>
<p>It seems to me that just as important (perhaps even more important) than the angular vs curvy &ldquo;potential authenticity&rdquo; difference between Greek and Latin is the former&rsquo;s much lower regard for alignment. The Latin caps are made to fit (mostly) between two lines, and the Latin lc (mostly) between four. In Greek however historically there&rsquo;s been a certain leaning towards a single <cite>median</cite> line (especially in the caps) as well as a large degree of deviation from the &ldquo;x-height&rdquo; as well as the extender lines in the lc.</p>
<p>So I think it might be possible to sometimes make Greek more
&ldquo;authentic&rdquo; by being a bit naughty about vertical alignment.</p>

<p>Looking at written Ethopic scripts and especially John H&rsquo;s Nyalla ( but not other Ethopic fonts so much ) shows an example of that going on in another script. Chris' sample does seem to bear your idea out to a point.</p>
<p>Do you have any good examples to look at.</p>
<p>What would Gerry say?</p>
<p>I wonder if from a political EU &amp; trade perspective looking Latin compatible might be seen as desirable. I have heard this described ( in the context of Greek) as the urge towards &lsquo;modernity&rsquo; here on Typophile. Interestingly this is also how I have heard a Ato, an Ethiopic type designer express himself.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I love the idea myself - but that might not be the point sometimes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that there is a dominant typographic trend but I would understand the curiosity as sometimes perception could be slightly different than reality.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a lot of highly geometric type families in Greek that are widely used as well as many others that are based on chirography that are equally used. The difference is on where and how they are used. As G.Trianta remarked, Gill Sans Hellenic, DIN Greek, Meta Greek or Myriad could be a trend for a corporate or magazine design use, while Warnock, Fedra B, Omonia or our Apollonia (which like many GFS type families are designed by T. Katsoulidis) could be a trend for a book design.</p>
<p>And again, I totally agree with G.Trianta' quote
&ldquo;So, do we really need to think in terms of “nationalistic” or “latinized” or “exoticized” or whatever designs, rather than thinking in more universal terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I would question though, is some information about a brief history of Greek script in modern times. Especially, I don&rsquo;t see any relation between the social or political status in Greece of the early seventies and Linotype&rsquo;s typeface development to a so called &ldquo;western&rdquo; texture.
This texture existed decades before and had there been an influence on type, this would surely be towards a &ldquo;non western&rdquo; or a more &ldquo;exoticized&rdquo; direction.
All Greeks who lived that period (1967-74) remember that during the military junta, everything &ldquo;western&rdquo; was considered as a bad influence or even a sub-cultural product.
(Not to mention that all english speaking songs were banned from the radio, or that famous records such as the Beetles  &ldquo;Sgt Pepper&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; was first released in Greece 8 years after its original release and a year after the fall of the dictatorship).
Also anyone would remember these tacky revival parades at the Stadium dressed in ancient clothes or like byzantine emperors.
And of course, the motto &ldquo;We belong to the west&rdquo; was not repeated then, simply because the first time it was pronounced was 4 years after the fall of the dictatorship by the late Karamanlis (uncle of today&rsquo;s PM) on his effort to track the country into the European Community and back to NATO alliance. Instead, the sound bite used by the colonels was the triangle &ldquo;state, religion and family&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, as written above, the Thessaloniki conference in June, or even finding some Greek newspapers, books and printed material would be a good resource to have a more spherical of what Greeks prefer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The overall sociocultural milieu of Greece in the 70s was surely as you describe, but I guess that&rsquo;s a testament to the fact that type has been (and still is, although to a lesser degree) a hidden subculture, and this made it possible to produce highly Latinized designs at that time. This &ldquo;covertness&rdquo; I guess allowed the Greek newspaper people of the 70s to tell Linotype to make those fonts as Western as possible without getting in trouble. At least that&rsquo;s the version we always hear, including from people like M Carter! I guess it&rsquo;s possible that Linotype and its designers would like to deflect &ldquo;credit&rdquo; for the highly Latinized Greek typestyles of the 70s, and in reality it was mostly their idea (probably because such a style would have been easier to make for them) but I have to doubt it.</p>

<p>The design programme was very much driven by demand. Mike Parker relates that Linotype were approached by a Greek businessman who wanted to be their sales rep in Greece. He claimed that he could get Linotype composing machinery into every newspaper and typesetting house in Greece if Linotype would undertake to produce any Greek typeface requested by the customers. Linotype had no significant Greek type development prior to this, and the faces produced were as requested by the Greek customers, communicated to Linotype via their sales rep, who apparently succeeded in gaining for Linotype virtually the entire Greek type composing market.</p>
<p>Why did the Greeks want Helvetica, Baskerville, etc.? That is indeed an interesting question given the social and political situation of the day. Helvetica is particularly interesting because it&rsquo;s associations were not merely western but internationalist and linked to a modernist movement with strong socialist links.</p>

<p>Well the question really is why did Greek newspaper men want to be more Western, and the answer might be that, considering newspapers tend towards the liberal end of sociopolitical thought, they wanted to resist the ideals of the junta, albeit in a subliminal, and essentially safe, way. The couldn&rsquo;t publish liberal, dissenting <cite>content</cite>, so maybe the typography was turned into a venting mechanism.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A quick check on dates indicates that only Helvetica Greek was released during the dictatorship, in 1971. Century Schoolbook was released in 1976, Baskerville in 1979, and ITC Souvenir in 1981. All for Mergethaler Linotype&rsquo;s V-I-P system.</p>
<p>So in large respect the social and cultural situation of the junta years is less relevant, except in the case of Helvetica, than the period immediately after.</p>
<p>Regarding Helvetica Greek, what would be interesting to know is when the project was initiated, which Greek customer(s) for Linotype systems expressed a desire for this typeface, and how it was first used.</p>
<p>By 1973, opposition to the military regime had become increasingly open both domestically and internationally, and the opposition was not limited to left or liberal groups, but included businessmen worried about the regime&rsquo;s impact on international investment in Greece and also monarchists calling for the return of King Constantine and the establishment of a constitutionally legitimate government. It would be interesting to see examples of how Helvetica was used during this period, the first couple of years of its introduction in the Greek market.</p>

<p>Paul, thanks for digging up my previous comments on Cadmus. I&rsquo;m always nervous when someone makes reference to something I said e.g. four years ago. Am I going to have to explain why I said it, or why I might have changed my mind in the interim? In this case, I think the comments pretty much stand. In reference to your comment about the final sigma, I actually don&rsquo;t find this a problematic letter in Cadmus: the transition from the top part of the final sigma to the descender should be more fluid than the transition in zeta and ksi.</p>

Ahhhh. It was slow. As slow and meticulous as the letterrdrawing was, the making of plaques and then fonts and then proofs took 30-60 days from the time manufacturing got the drawings until the office got proofs. Take this and put it in a tube and send it to Greece, London or Frankfurt for comments and you&rsquo;d add another month. Make changes, two more months. etc&hellip;in 4-6 months you migh have one style&hellip;each style after that took more time not less, as it most often doesn&rsquo;t today.</p>

However, while I have no love for a regime that brought dictatorship to the part of the European continent not behind the Iron Curtain in the postwar era (of course, that exaggerates slightly; with Franco, and, indeed, Salazar, it was already there), being under the oppressive rule of a foreign conqueror did indeed mean that Greeks largely lived from day to day from 1453 to 1830, not having the opportunity to build for the future.</p>
<p>Thus, while the Portuguese have Brazil, the Greeks missed out on being the first to settle, perhaps, Australia. It wasn&rsquo;t a Greek who invented the telescope, or the steam locomotive. We don&rsquo;t have a corpus of Greek symphonies and Greek operas in the standard repertoire, the way we have German symphonies and Italian operas. Or even Russian symphonies and French operas. And so on and so forth - Greece is still behind countries like Britain and France because of the debilitating effects of that period.</p>

<p>By your reasoning, it seems that colonialism is the only way to “build for the future”. And, also, Ottoman Empire has Greece. Does it means the “standard repertoire” should include Ottoman symphonies and operas?</p>

<p>Ultimately, with advances in education and literacy, indeed, not only the Turks, but each linguistic group in India or Africa similarly somehow needs the chance to flower into a fully developed nation with cutting-edge science and technology, and an economic substrate that supports a vibrant cultural life - so that they would contribute to world science and culture&hellip; as, say, Japan is doing, in the electronics industry and with anime.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Many things of value happened in world history from 1453 to 1830&hellip;&rdquo;
and one of those things is that Greece learned to survive extreme difficulty. They also learned what it felt like to be conquered.  This is something unknown in Alexander&rsquo;s reign of conquest. The soul of a person, as well as a country, is made by knowing that glory is not won on a battlefield or marked by territory taken or great works heralded, in years of superiority. It is made more by the recovery from trying times, the will to return from agony, and yet the true fortitude to forgive your transgressors as others have forgiven your transgressions. Strength is knowing you have survived to grow better rather than to perpetuate eternal hatred. 
As with every other conquered people in history, the Greeks worked much harder and learned much more under oppression than they did when Alexander and his father raised their swords in victory.
There is a point where the hatred must stop so that the understanding can begin or else we are all doomed to repeat the endless brutal cycle until we are all extinguished from life.</p>
<p>Greeks can now move on and write symphonies and operas, because they have learned both sides of passion and that forgiveness is the greatest gift we can offer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">[Chris, it is worth remembering, since you cite Philip and Alexander, that they were very much seen by the Greeks as Macedonian invaders and conquerors, despite the strong cultural ties between the two peoples. It was only later that Alexander&rsquo;s conquests in the East were framed in terms of &lsquo;Hellenism&rsquo; and celebrated as Greek triumphs. Even before the military invasion of Greece and the forced submission of the ancient city states to Macedonian rule, there were periods of anti-Macedonian feeling in Athens, incited by the rhetoric of orators such as Demosthenes. Aristotle&rsquo;s periods of residence in his northern homeland appear to correspond with these outbreaks of anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens. Philosophers go home!]</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I do not want to be a conqueror. I want to be a liberator.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t want everyone forced to learn to speak English just to have a decent selection of books to read or movies to watch or popular music to listen to.</p>
<p>Every nation should be free. Not conquering and dominating other nations, but free and prosperous in its own right. Right now, though, there is not enough world for so many nations to function. A few lucky ones have more than their share of space, and thus have been able to thrive.</p>
<p>I see this as a bad thing with the potential for causing more human misery. For example, if a government commits aggression, in a world where people thirst for resources, the temptation upon defeating the government to strip the nation and its people of their territory will be strong.</p>

It wasn&rsquo;t a Greek who invented the telescope, or the steam locomotive. We don&rsquo;t have a corpus of Greek symphonies and Greek operas in the standard repertoire, the way we have German symphonies and Italian operas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow! I guess the first swarm of bees to release is that it&rsquo;s pretty much agreed by historians and ethnicists that the people inhabiting Greece from the 15th to the 19th centuries a.d. were not much related, if at all, to the people inhabiting Greece from the 7th c b.c to the 1st c a.d&hellip; That much happened. Greeks don&rsquo;t like to hear this, so sorry if it offends modern Greeks.</p>
<p>Swarm of bees two then, is that we have no idea what places were settled and what things were invented written and sung by the descendants of those who lived in Greece before the 2nd century a.d. Non Greeks don&rsquo;t like to hear this, and sorry if this offends non Greeks. Who&rsquo;s to know that James Watt&rsquo;s family, 25 generations before the steam engine, didn&rsquo;t land in England with the name Pompendropolotapus, the neighbors said &ldquo;Say what?&rdquo; and changed their name to Watt?</p>
<p>And isn&rsquo;t that Greek type conferees held on Cyprus now?</p>

<p>I can imagine that during periods of foreign conquest, there was sexual exploitation of the downtrodden population, leading to admixture of foreign ancestry.</p>
<p>But where would the ancient Greeks have gone? Sure, a few of them may have wound up as Pharaohs in Egypt, or slaves in Rome, but if the modern Greeks have little or nothing to do with the ancient Greeks, <em>why are they even speaking Greek?</em></p>
<p>Or is it that prior to the 15th Century, Greece was such a prosperous place that it was a magnet for immigrants who adopted the language?</p>
<p>A bit of research allowed me to find one page claiming that in Nuristan in Afghanistan, a group of Greeks left behind by Alexander survived.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on another web page, some Macedonians (the Yugoslav kind), annoyed (in my opinion, entirely justifiably) that Greece does not like what they want to name their country, are claiming that the ancient Greeks were wiped out, and Greece was a country full of Bulgarians, Albanians, Christian refugees from Turkey (Armenians?), and something called &ldquo;Vlahs&rdquo;&hellip; but, apparently, no Greeks. But it could be they&rsquo;re not objective.</p>

Some more web searching allowed me to determine that the people sometimes called Vlahs or Vlachs are not dimension travellers from Vlah, but are in fact the Arumanians, a small ethnic minority, formerly nomadic cattle breeders, in Macedonia (the one certain nationalist Greeks refer to as FYROM).</div>
