  body: You're right. I "edited" this, though it seems to have been posted as a separate

  body: "Maybe one lesson of this experience is to give your thread a meaningful (unique)
    title -- please! Another could be to name samples in a less generic way. So these
    are sample of Legend of Zelda graphics? If you can point to a web site, or better
    yet actually post the graphics, we might be able to see something. (BTW, as the
    thread originator, you are able to edit this thread title. Please use something
    that relates to the subject mystery font, such as \"Legend of Zelda serif (or
    script, or?)\".\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
