  actually held it 3 -- maybe 4 times. Twice while it was still in the box. Anyhow,
  (not complaining) from looking over her shoulder, it seems that a lot of the aps
  are rather crudely adapted from the iPhone. the interface is iPhone size by default
  and and increasing it to iPad size scales everything up uniformly so that the type
  is way too big. I'm assuming that with time this will be addressed but right now
  it is a short coming in my opinion..\r\n\r\nShe's really enjoying Sketchbook Pro
  but I'm thinking that something with some vector editing abilities would be useful
  to the as well\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?  (yeah, no type here, but i'm sure it will
  come up before long)\r\n\r\nR\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: All the apps I have are made for the iPad. Perhaps your wifey have been selecting
    the cheapest options and thus the iPhone versions. There are no good vector apps
    available yet. Freeform seems to be the one with most possibilities but it's very
    crude and not really useful.

    fit the iPad and they are just fine, No issue there. But newspaper aps and maps
    - things like that often have iPhone proportions by  default even though it is
    suposed to be an iPad version. \r\n\r\nPaul: well gee thanks, but that's an obvious
    spelling mistake and not a gramatical error at all, sir. \r\n\r\nR"

    \r\n\r\nThere are more, Frode. don't ask me what, because I won't remember. It
    looks like a case of some organizations needing to get on the ball and catch up.
    We were surprised though. Especially by the Times. We'd have thought they would
    be keeping up better than that."

  body: "The apps that are \"crudely adapted from the iPhone\" are actually just iPhone
    apps, which the iPad is able to run. Look for apps that are designed for the iPad.
    You can view these separately in the iTunes store by clicking the \"iPad\" tab
    at the top of the Apps page.\r\n\r\nSome apps are \"universal\" apps that look
    different depending on whether you run them on the iPhone or iPad (taking advantage
    of the extra room on the iPad). \r\n\r\nWith other apps, there are separate iPhone
    and iPad versions. \r\n\r\nIf, when you launch the app on an iPad, it's displayed
    at iPhone size and has that little \"1x\" button in the corner, then it's not
    designed specifically for the iPad, i.e., it's an iPhone app."

    the apps I have are iPad-designed, and they look wonderful. I also have 3 apps
    to read ebooks (including the Apple one), and the experience of reading a book,
    a newspaper or a comics on this thing is really great, expecially when on a journey.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    I am not really fond of iPhone 4, iPad is just awesome, but it's true that this
    feeling grows as you use it."
