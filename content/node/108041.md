  for a Japanese font with Japanese characters for numbers.\r\nSo, not using our own
  1-9 'characters' but Japanese characters representing them.\r\nDoes such a thing
  exist?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Any typical Japanese that includes a minimal number of glyphs for kanji should
    suffice for this purpose. Here are the main number characters: \u96F6\u3007\u4E00\u4E8C\u4E09\u56DB\u4E94\u516D\u4E03\u516B\u4E5D\u5341\u767E\u5343\u4E07\u5104\u5146."

    guess.\r\nIs there somewhere I can find a more elaborate explanation?\r\nI'm required
    to use it for numbering in a magazine..."

  body: The first two represent zero (the first is the official kanji, and the second
    is an alternate form). The next ten are one through ten, followed by 100, 1,000,
    10,000, 100,000,000, and 1,000,000,000,000. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kanji_by_concept#Numbers.2C_counting.2C_sequence|This
    Wikipedia page]] may help.
