    into Williams Caslon: you can do 3/16 or 235/789, and it will work, kerned. Also
    lining figures, proportional and monospaced, and old style figures, proportional
    and lined. And small caps fractions.\r\n\r\nIf you want some sharp serifs\u2014which
    work better in display IMHO\u2014you can do Williams Caslon Text for Text and
    Big Caslon for Titles, as Boston Magazine has done. Big Caslon has stylish italics
    you can get if you ask.     "

  body: "That's interesting.\r\nMy first inclination would be to say that old style
    figures and fractions don't combine well, as many of the integers are so short
    (esp. 1 and 2) that they are almost the same height as the figures in the fractions.
    However, their form is so different that a sufficient contrast is established
    -- very \"tactile\".\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ingred_5219.png]"

    a playful font like Oneleigh, you might make it work, but I doubt it generally.
    \  \r\n\r\nOn the issue of having uniform width fractions, this can't work when
    you have more than one digit in the numerator or denominator. Williams Caslon
    Text has uniform width fractions for the basic half, thirds, quarters and eighths,
    if you want them. \r\n\r\nThere is also the option in proportional old style of
    the traditional \"I\" shaped one and \"ring\" shaped zero, on one hand, and the
    default barbed one and stressed zero. "

    playfulness of the \"font\".\r\nIt's how homogenized the interpretation of the
    oldstyle is.\r\nCompare Monotype Garamond with Adobe Garamond.\r\nThey are both
    the same typeface, Garamond, but Slimbach's interpretation homogenizes the treatment
    of the figures.\r\n\r\nThis is a departure from 20th century metal, where fractions
    were generic, modern, and lining.\r\nSo if a typographer used oldstyle figures
    for integers, then there would automatically be a stylistic contrast with the
    fractions.\r\n\r\nNut fractions is another story..."

    fractions with tabular and proportional options?\r\n\r\nI made the fractions in
    my [[http://typophile.com/node/67787|font]] all proportional (especially considering
    the huge difference between digit one and all the others), but I guess it would
    be a good idea to also include tabular variants. So when user selects tabular
    numbers, fractions are set accordingly.\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm using 10 set of numbers
    (aligned to uppercase, small caps and petite caps, besides old style and the default
    set, whose height is midway small caps and uppercase).\r\n\r\nAlthough not similar
