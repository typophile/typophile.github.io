		<div class="commentbody">I think the problem I'm seeing recently is that there have been too many claims as to the all-in-one nature of developing fonts in Font Lab. For many of the reasons above, I have been reluctant to spent the time or money to learn if this is even somthing I really need or not. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->While I'm pleased to see Font Lab continues to update its software and it gets better every time, the benefits of Font Lab haven't become so obvious to me that I could see it being a worthwhile purchase. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant I also don't understand there are post-production benefits of Font Lab.

I do most of my design work in Illustrator mainly so I can edit characters in context with other characters. Having to edit characters in isolation has always felt constraining. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since then, I had another idea that might be even better: A plug-in which would allow you to develop a font directly in Illustrator. Even if it was just to get the basic design down (i.e., minus hinting, encoding, etc.) so you could export a font to be finished in FOG or FL or whatever. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I picture something similar to the symbol library, but with glyph names listed. Each glyph would be defined in the drawing window by drawing a glyph and a bounding box (to define the ascent, descent, and side bearings), selecting both and choosing &quot;Create Glyph&hellip;&quot; from a menu or by dragging them onto a glyph name in the palette. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Glyphs could be dragged out of the palette to the drawing area and placed next to each other to form words. Any defined glyph could be edited in place. If the side bearings (of the bounding box) are changed, the characters to the right would move themselves accordingly. It may also be possible to create kerning pairs, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The palette would have an &quot;Export Font&hellip;&quot; command to export the font at any time for further work in another program (for hinting, special encoding, etc.). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I see this as mainly a tool for the design phase, not as a tool for producing finished fonts. All the well-honed tools of Illustrator would be at hand (rather than try to recreated them in FOG or FL or whatever). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Existing tools and plug-ins in Illustrator already perform similar specialized functions (the symbol library, the graphing tool, etc.) why not something for creating fonts?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Fond memories. I also had Yuri's Font Designer v.1&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last time I used Font Designer in earnest was to digitise an 'Italian' type of 1821, a really delightful exercise in geometry in which the designer had reversed the thicks and things of a Fat Face design; I've also used it for another font in which rigorous geometry was important, a version of Edward Johnston's Underground type. Neither of these fonts have been commercially released, by the way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Font Designer 1.1 has a beautifully intuitive way of constructing an outline, a way of storing serifs, stems etc in a library, and good options for drawing guidelines. It's also - and this I think is why it continues to appeal to me - got a totally understated interface. The screen is uncluttered, and there's very little getting between me and the character I'm working on. In that respect it's not unlike Aldus PageMaker 5. Technically I shouldn't imagine that FD 1.1 now has anything going for it that Fontlab doesn't have in spadefulls, but that hasn't stopped me dusting it down recently for a new project I'm working on. I'll probably use it as my drawing tool, generate a Type 1, and then pull that into Fontlab. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The program itself has a hardware dongle, but I do have a demo which I'd imagine could legally be sent to anyone who asks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Incidentally, does anyone have unwanted copies (software + original manuals, preferably with packaging!) for these and similar programs? I'm Curator of the Type Museum, London, and recognise that this is an area we should start collecting seriously - the museum already has unrivalled collections of punches, matrixes and hot-metal equipment.

		<div class="commentbody">Today the Dutch Type Library released version 2 of DTL FontMaster. The release includes free light versions of four of the modules. The light versions of Bezier- and IkarusMaster are fully functional and only have one restriction: not more than 256 glyphs can be stored per database. With the light version of DataMaster it is possible to generate PostScript Type 1 fonts for Mac OS (only with the Mac edition) and Windows. The light version of ContourMaster makes a complete testing of font databases possible, which results in a listing (automatically improving is not enabled). However, the improver functions of Bezier- and IkarusMaster can be used on character level to make the necessary corrections.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Anonymous, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the listing of possible improvements of DTL FontMaster. Although FM already has a lot of functionality which will be probably overlooked by many users, the FontMaster Team is constantly discussing the necessity of new functions. FM was originally produced for internal use at the Dutch Type Library and normally the enhancements of the modules is based on internal needs at DTL. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OpenType generation is fully supported by DTL FontMaster, of course. FM was the first program which automated the OTF feature generation. Also the database system was made for handling large glyph sets. With the light version we already made a lot of technology available for free and for many users the functionality will be more than sufficient. The OTF production is, of course, part of the full version. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To reply on some of your other suggestions: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The standard guidelines are automatically placed based on the information in the Font Header and you can place as many as you like in the V/H Guide Lines section. You can store as many glyphs in a slot as you wish. Coordinates can be edited using the Edit Coordinates window, which shows a full listing of all points. In the Windows version the right button can be used to paste and cut. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Internally at DTL there is no real demand for an OS X version, but -as I stated earlier- we will probably produce one, if only to underline our commitment to Mac users.</div>
