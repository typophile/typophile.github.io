  I was hoping to see if anyone else would like to join me in this experiment/project.
  The basics of it are, to \"find\" or make a letterform a day for 50 days. It can
  be found anywhere or in anything. You can make one or draw one. Paint one or just
  find one that's already made. An exercise to open up the possibilities of what can
  be considered typography, or where we can find typography. Inspired by Stefan Sagmeister
  and Michael Beirut, I've dedicated myself to find or make a letterform a day. You
  can follow the progress here... http://nicolascervantes.wordpress.com/  Post your
  letterforms there and also comment. Thanks guys, here's aB that jumped out at me
  today.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/b_small_5629.jpg]"
