  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've decided upon the classic Minion Pro for my PhD thesis (human geography / cultural studies).

However, it seems that Minion Pro is a pain to read on screen at 11pt
(I'm writing the thesis using OpenOffice, but it's the same in MS Word or Acrobat Professional and even the windows font preview)
Alignments and spacings are really off (the dots on the i appear between the letters, the first arc of the m is half the width of the second and the r huddles up against the next character, and so on...)

I can, of course, use a different font for writing (I'm currently using DejaVu for screen readability) but I'm required to submit both a paper and electronic copy of the thesis. (And I imagine my examiners may be reading the electronic version)

Is my experience of Minion Pro & screen reading a common problem, or is something wrong with my screen / font setup?

If it is a common problem, is there a decent screen-readable Minion version available? Or any suggestions for a similar font which is readable on-screen?

(I'm loathe to use completely different typefaces for both versions of the thesis, because of the extra editing that will inevitably entail...)</div>

You seem alarmingly unclear on the PhD concept. You need, in collaboration with your supervisors, to get a clear idea of "done." The font is the least of your worries. Finish the thesis, then worry about the font. 

On screen, say with a PDF, people can always zoom in on the text. </div>

Maybe send your chapters to a typesetter (read design student) as you complete them?

And yes, I have noticed that Minion does that in Word. Don't know about other software.</div>

Is this from Windows? If you and those who evaluate you are working on Windows, you might try John Hudson's Constantia, as this is more literary in look and should render well on screen. It is one of the relatively new "C" fonts that comes with Word.  </div>

No, that's a bigger problem!  :-/
The font has to work onscreen at full page width.

		<div class="commentbody">My thesis will also turn up in Minion, eventually. The rendering of Adobe fonts in Windows is generally terrible; it's not just you. It seems more unusual, though, that it's also happening in Adobe Reader. You're not, perhaps, using Microsoft's PDF exporter for Word, are you? It will export the page as an image rather than type, with generally disastrous results.

LaTeX still seems to be the cool software for writing a thesis, but I really think that it's simply too complicated for most people. For better typography, then, my plan is to write the thing in Word and import the files into InDesign for final submission. Perhaps this is overkill, but I'm somewhat addicted to real small caps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">CFF rendering on Windows is generally pathetic if applications are relying on the system for rendering. If you were to use Adobe's Creative Suite applications, I'm sure you would not be seeing the same issues. Also, if the final electronic copy will be in PDF format, it is doubtful that you will face the rendering problems you are seeing in OpenOffice (depending on what reader application you are using and how it handles CFF rendering).

For full disclosure I am an Adobe employee. However, I have tried to objectively characterize the problem as I see it (even if 'pathetic' might seem too emotive).</div>
