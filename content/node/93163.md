  had a popular jazz club located off the lobby and a lot of the building elements
  are connected to early jazz culture. Wondering what typeface these numbers are.
  \r\n\r\nWorking on a project for the building and would love to find the history
  of the typeface and see if there is any jazz crossover. My gut says no but I would
  love to research further.\r\n\r\nThank you as always for your time and thoughts.
  I truly appreciate it."

  body: No typeface there. Both are the work of sign painters, who follow their own
    rules for making letters (and numbers). A different but parallel world from type.

  body: A sign painter might be able to help, especially an older one. I don't know
    enough about the history of various sign writing styles to date it. It was probably
    painted relatively recently. Paint doesn't last forever outdoors. However, that
    doesn't mean the style is recent. Old signs get repainted periodically.
