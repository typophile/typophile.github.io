body: Hi, I'm trying to photoshop a reply to this nametag invitation, and to edit
  what it says, I really need some help with the font. I know the seems like a really
  common font, but I'm really not sure what it is, even after looking it up online
  (the match wasn't the same).  I already figured out the handwritten part to be "Complete
  in Him." [img:sites/default/files/old-images/09-04-2012 05_5508.png] That's the
  front part. On the back , there seems to be a different font for the text in black.
  I couldn't ID that either, and I'm not sure the orange font is the same as the font
  in the front. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/09-04-20122 05_5459.png] Can you
  guys help me out? Thank you so much!

    scale it down, if you guys need it.
