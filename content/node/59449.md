body: "I've been using Caxton (the newest OpenType version) for a book project, but
  I'm getting to the point where I'm frustrated by its lack of advanced typographic
  features (small caps, superscripts, etc) so I'm wondering if there's a similar looking
  typeface that has more of a complete feature set. I really like the look of Caxton,
  but cannot for the life of me think of something similar enough to switch to.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Caxton is pretty unique. How about <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/typetogether/karmina_ot/">Karmina</a>?  See
    the typographic features <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/typetogether/karmina_regular_ot/?s=c">here</a>.
    SC and Superscript included.
