  body: "Thanks Brad and Suntory. I just read through the thread. But it mainly talks
    about the 0 on a typedesign level. I once read somewhere that It had a somewhat
    more political or historical reason for it's non-design, not only to diffrentiate
    from the o. Like the 0 was often regarded as a non-character maybe as a reference
    to its mathematical meaning of \"nothing\"? Math-history sais the ancestor of
    the 0 was originally introduced in India only as a placeholder in shape of a period
    or later a circle. Apparently the Church even banned the character when it was
    introduced later in India-Arabic Mathematics. I'm interested how that affected
    typedesigners?\r\n"

  body: "The zero played a special role when Arabic numerals were introduced into
    western writing. It was only its use as a place holder within a positional system
    that made modern arithmetics possible. Leonardo di Pisa (also known as Fibonacci)
    introduced the concept of zero and numerals in his 'Liber abaci' in 1202 as follows:\r\n\r\n'The
    nine Indian figures are the following: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. This is why
    with these nine figures and the sign 0, called zephirum in Arabic, all the numbers
    you may wish can be written.'\r\n\r\nLeonardo uses the word 'zephirum', which
    later became the word zero, and he clearly distinguishes between the nine numerals
    and the zero, a distinction that later found its equivalent in the design of the
    numerals and the zero in early printing types. The zero in Renaissance typefaces
    is a perfect circle without any modulation in stroke thickness, thus making its
    actual form look a little bit different from that of the other numerals.\r\n\r\nThe
    shape of the numerals in mediaeval manuscripts were different from our modern
    numerals. The \u20184\u2019 resembled an \u20188\u2019 with an opened lower bowl,
    the \u20185\u2019 looked like a contemporary handwritten \u20184\u2019, and the
    \u20187\u2019 looks like a \u2018V\u2019 upside down. (When wou read the caption
    in Phil Baines and Andrew Haslam: 'Type and Typography' on page 45 you can see
    how the authors therefore confused the old shape of 5 with 9.) It was only through
    the renaissance printers that the shape of the numerals as we know them nowadays
    were established.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the history of the numbers

  body: "The first printed books did not make use of Arabic numerals at all. None
    of Gutenberg\u2019s printings contain any Arabic numerals. Ratdolt was one of
    the first to use printed Arabic numerals in his books \u2013 many of which were
    about mathematics and astronomy. His numerals left behind any traces of medieval
    forms and are immediately familiar to the modern eye. The zero is a perfect circle.
    Aldus's zero was a perfect circle, as well as the zeros in Garamond's typefaces.\r\n\r\nFrancois
    Guyot was one of the first type designer (or was he the first at all?) to cut
    both a roman and an italic related to each other, evidently with the idea that
    both may be used together. He used exactly the same numerals for both the roman
    and the italic typeface (as one can see in the Folger type specimen of c. 1565).
    His zero is a perfect circle. (BTW, perfect circle actually means perfect circle
    - the counter in one of Granjon's typefaces was drilled, as one can see in Fred
    Smeijers: 'Counterpunch', p 158.)\r\n\r\nAmeet Tavernier was the first punchcutter
    who designed inclined numerals for an italic typeface, but he did not dare to
    touch the perfect circle shape of the zero, so the zero is upright and not inclined.\r\n\r\nApproximately
    at the same time, Robert Granjon cut his first italic with inclined numerals,
    but he also slanted the zero, which therefore turned into an oval. It is very
    interesting to observe that Granjon, even if he abandoned the shape of the perfect
    circle, retained the other characteristic feature of the zero, its monolinear
    stroke thickness. He must have found it important to still keep the shape of the
    zero different, while trying to bring the design of the numerals closer to the
    design of the italic. \r\n\r\nThe introduction of numerals of equal width (one
    of the two features commonly attributed to the so-called \u2018tabular figures\u2019
    as opposed to the so-called \u2018old-style figures\u2019) preceded the new design
    of numerals of uniform height. Already in 1764, Pierre-Simon Fournier le jeune
    wrote in his Manuel typographique about numerals of equal width:\r\n\r\n\u2018The
    figures of the roman have no respective sets, but one uniform one. They are all
    cast to the thickness of an n-quadrate; that is to say that two of them put side
    by side make a square of the size of the body.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe first numerals
    of equal height were cut by Richard Austin for the founder John Bell in 1788.
    It was the zero that suffered most from this treatment, since it was both squeezed
    into a far too narrow horizontal space and stretched to capital height at the
    same time.\r\n"

    the reading of running text, however slightly.\r\n\r\nI don't know \u2013 It doesn't
    really bug me (as a reader), but then on the other hand as a designer - even if
    I really appreciate that there are well made revivals of historical typefaces
    available - I hardly use them in the end...\r\n\r\nBut that's not only because
    of the zero. \r\n\r\nSomehow I feel that revivals are WRONG. I really love to
    look at old type specimens, but I am not sure whether I enjoy a - say - Garamond
    or Caslon in offset printing. \r\n(Of course, one could ask whether this is not
    simply a side-effect of knowing too much about type. When I was still in the innocent
    state of a person who doesn't know and care about type, a person who just loves
    to read, I read a lot of Garamont, and I never stopped reading because of a badly
    designed zero.)\r\nI do enjoy Galliard, but for me it doesn't have that much Granjon
    in it, I rather see the seventies in it. \r\n\r\nAs for shape of the zero: \r\nI
    think John Hudson was right when he pointed out that the strongest argument for
    a perfect circle zero nowadays is not a design argument but a marketing argument:\r\n'The
    answer in most revivals seems to be to follow the original; after all, the selling
    point of the design is that it is a revival of something'\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/19212"

  body: ">How do you feel about this oldstyle zero in modern settings? It must hinder
    the reading of running text, however slightly.\r\n\r\nMy feeling about this issue:
    \r\n\r\nThe numerals in any case don't follow the 'rules' of upper or lower case.
    Even when their color is beautifully harmonious with the u & lc, you can pick
    them out right away on a page. So to me the old style zero doesn't stick out more
    than the rest of the numerals, provided it is the right weight and slightly modulated--i.e.
    not a perfect circle.  \r\n\r\nAs to revivals, first I agree with Wolfgang to
    the extent that I think the goal of an \"authentic\" revival is misguided. But
    I do think that revivals that attempt to capture what an old face did well, for
    new technology, is often well worth the effort. For example, Monotype 's metal
    Bembo and Baskerville, among others, were great typefaces.  And among digital
    revivals, I greatly admire Adobe Garamond, and I suppose the newest Premier is
    even better though I don't have it.    \r\n\r\nI think the truth is that all typefaces
    are modifications of older faces--and this applies even to the first printing
    types, which took the hands of scribes as their starting point. So whether you
    call it a revival or not is mainly a matter of how close the 'revival' is to an
    old type, and, as John says, a marketing decision also.\r\n\r\nStudying the old,
    and trying to capture the best of it for today--I'm all for it. "
