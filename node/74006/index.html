The colors and style feel a bit more casual and surfer than upscale formal.  Not sure how the circle plays into that idea, or if it is fitting to the company.  But I agree with the others about the bottom right font choice being best.  Neat concept.</div>

I happen to like the circle and colour choice very much, but that&rsquo;s just me. The type doesn&rsquo;t work for me. It could be so much stronger. Perhaps something handwritten, or something that followed the circle shape. If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable drawing type yourself, there&rsquo;s no shame in hiring help! After all, most of us (Typophiles) are type designers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for the feedback. Rather than an upscale image, I believe the company wants to give off a warmer, lighter feeling while still projecting a professional image. They requested the use of warm earth tones and provided me with a pdf with images of natural elements. As for the circle, I added it because just having the bikini top looked unbalanced to me. I felt the circle sort of glued everything together. If you guys have any suggestions on that, please let me know. I did try something hand-written but it ended up looking a bit kiddish which would not fit the target audience. But again, I&rsquo;m open to suggestions.</p>
<p>Here are three versions with varying weights of the bottom right rendition. Personally, I like the second one the best but I&rsquo;d like to hear some thoughts on that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I suppose the logo is final. So I comment with caution and respect.</p>
<p>I wonder if the circle isn&rsquo;t causing the illustration to be a little misread. (I first saw a very curvy body shape with large thighs, but now see the top.) Could the shape in which the top sits be a little more organic or interact somehow with the top? It feels as if the top is trapped. Or could the straps somehow interact with the circle?</p>
<p>Having a second color in the type, for me, disconnects the mark from the logotype. Or will you, somehow, include an accent of the 2nd color in the mark?</p>

<p>As for the mark, I&rsquo;m still trying different approaches and putting everyone&rsquo;s thoughts into consideration but I thought I&rsquo;d show the bikini out of the circle for now. When I first tried this, I thought it didn&rsquo;t look right but I tried it again a second time and strangely it looked better. Plus, w/ the bikini out of the circle, I think people will see the bikini first rather than its negative shape. Any thoughts on this?</p>

I showed my previous rendition to the client and unfortunately I was way off. She was looking for more of a sexy/clean/modern/earthy vibe with a non-literal mark. Also, apparently, the one I showed her gave off a &ldquo;maternity&rdquo; feeling. She gave me some new direction and wanted me to focus on the ampersand so it could be used both as part of the logo and separately as an abbreviated mark.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@hola Yes, still swimwear. That sounds like a great idea but I can&rsquo;t imagine how I would execute it with such limited space. Thanks for the suggestion. It&rsquo;ll definitely open up some doors to new creative ideas.</p>
<p>@riccard0 Is it hard to tell it&rsquo;s a leaf? I&rsquo;ll explore other options.</p>
<p>I used the leaf because it was the only way I could think of to inject &ldquo;natural/earthy&rdquo; into the design by the way.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s just a little stiff.
And, for swimwear I would see better a drop.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My days and nights are one big blur. ;) I was in the middle of working on another concept when I read what you wrote (riccard0) and tried a drop.</p>
<p>Simple, earthy, and has to do with swimming.</p>
<p>Possible candidate? (second one)</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample5_5928.jpg]</p>
<p>@Ratbaggy I agree 100%. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to keep the image insertions to a minimum. I think a simple image would add a nice touch to the mark though since they will be using it separately in abbreviated form.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>@jakes The target audience is 20s and 30s. The client really liked the branding of this company: <a href="http://bit.ly/dim59L">http://bit.ly/dim59L</a></p>
<p>Meaning something that looks elegant and timeless, yet natural and earthy at the same time.</p>
<p>Here are a few more concepts I was playing around with, 4 and 5 with a different font:</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Sans Serif has a more modern feeling to it, Slab I think is a little too manly for a swimwear company unless you used something light. I think the comment that jakes made about the newer iterations being old fashioned was on the money, especially using the ampersand as the logomark of the type. Nevertheless, the ampersand is one of my favourite glyphs. On the other hand, the blue/orange colour scheme really works. I think the primary problem with the stylisations of the ampersand is scale, none of them really hold up to scaling very well. What about abbreviating Lauren &amp; Holly to just L&amp;H? If the client wants to appeal to 20&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s they ought to reconsider your original direction, perhaps if you tried rehashing some iteration of your original with the pizazz of the new direction? I dunno, tough case but I think you&rsquo;ve brought a lot to the table.</div>
