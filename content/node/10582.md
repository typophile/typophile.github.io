    marker layout, and use of sans serif, from the 1880s.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/70855.jpg"

  body: Yeah, awesome lettering, especially the lower case. <BR>But the layouts are
    a bit dull -- what we call in the trade a &#34;tombstone&#34; layout.

  body: These photos are from the small 19th cemetery in Clifton, Bristol, England.
    Most of the people buried there are ex-colonial officers and their families. Unfortunately,
    the date is missing from one of these, and only the first three digits of the
    year are included in the arty photo with the leaves, but 185- suggests I&#39;m
    winning in this round of &#39;earliest date for sans serif lettering on tombs&#39;,
    although Dan may trump me with the lowercase. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/71041.jpg"
