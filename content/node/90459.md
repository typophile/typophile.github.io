  this year, and I've been asked to design some stuff for our local events. The national
  organization is taking care of all the national things, but our local group has
  enough money to pay for the printing and that's about it. \r\n\r\nWe were founded
  in 1912, so I thought it would be nice to put our programs, nametags, etc. in a
  font from 1912. I'd like it to be something people would notice and ask about, so
  I could say \"Oh, yes! That was ______________ and it's 100 years old, just like
  us!\" and also decidedly feminine, but not so flowery that it's illegible. \r\n\r\nIf
  anyone has any suggestions that are within a couple of years either way of 1912,
  preferably earlier, so our founders could have used it, that would be fine too.
  I have about six weeks on this, and if I do end up spending a little of my own money,
  I guess I could resign myself to that, although I don't have any idea of what this
  might involve. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance. \r\n\r\nBarbara"

    catalog of the American Type Founders\r\nand see what you like that's available
    digitally.\r\n\r\nBut hopefully some ATF-savvy people will help\r\nyou find a
    shortcut to a font that's just right.\r\nIn fact here's something that just came
    up:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/90458\r\n\r\nAnd in terms of overall style,\r\nmaybe
    something like this gem:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/412837790/in/set-72157594575660607/\r\n\r\nBTW,
    does you sorority have a mission\r\nthat might help narrow down the choices?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    out on Google; the original design is from 1912/1913. I'm not sure how good this
    'revival' really is but here you go:\r\nhttp://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Glass+Antiqua\r\nSample

  body: "Wow, I just love Glass Antiqua. That may be it right there, but I welcome
    more suggestions.  \r\n\r\nOur stated mission is \"to create close comradeship,
    to advance educational, social and philanthropic interests and leadership training;
    to encourage spiritual development and adherence to the highest moral standards;
    and to promote lifelong bonds of friendship.\" Nothing much different from any
    other fraternal group, I expect."

    that time period in their archives (graduation programs, invitations, etc), and
    they might be useful as design reference.\r\n\r\nWhere I went to college those
    materials were kept in a locked room at the library, but anyone could view them
    upon request. Anyway you might inquire at your library.\r\n\r\n> nametags\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to be authentic, keep in mind that any handwriting (like a name on a
    tag) was probably done in script using a fountain pen."

    we''re commemorating, so I don''t want to go Deco. The university won''t have
    anything of ours from 1912, but other groups would have had things, and the yearbooks
    could be invaluable. '
