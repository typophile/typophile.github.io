  cards.\r\nI seem to keep seeing the same ones used again and again and interested
  what they are.\r\n\r\nIf you can name the font and a movie that it was used in that
  would be ideal - or even more amazing - attach an image of the poster with the font(s)
  used.\r\n\r\nFor example: The font used in 'Prince of Persia' (both 'defy the future'
  at the top of the poster and the title font) seems like they're used all the time
  in movies. (I think they're just helvetica.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
