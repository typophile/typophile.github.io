body: "Hi, I'm collecting feedback and help for my thesis project.\r\n\r\nThe research
  part of the project is an analysis of the ongoing tendencies in design, such as
  generative design, conditional design, parametric design etc.\r\nAs a result of
  the research, I'd like to design and publish a complete typeface to be used as the
  official font for the Academy I'm studying at.\r\n\r\nI'd like to work with all
  the other students, researching their taste in typography, asking them what fonts
  do they think are more suitable to be officially used by the Academy, and then producing
  an average font based on the opinions.\r\n\r\nI've read about various parametric
  \"average\" typefaces, like the Averia:\r\nhttp://iotic.com/averia/\r\nand the Average
  typeface\r\nhttp://www.letterlabor.de/typeface.php\r\n\r\nBut I want my average
  font not to be based on my sole taste or on every font installed on my font library.
  I want it to be the true recreation of the opinions and ideas of all the students
  from the Academy (even those who don't give a sheewt about type design, yep).\r\nBut
  in order to do such a thing I still need of to teach any typedesign application
  to make an \"average\" type, whatever the sources of the process.\r\n\r\nDo you
  have advices/tips/etc.?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the reply, this stuff is quite
  important to me as it would be my first outbreak into 'true' type design.\r\n\r\na."

  body: "I recently taught a course of type design to graphic design students.\r\nThe
    goal was to create the students' version of a contemporary generic sans, through
    consensus.\r\n\r\nOne thing I will say: the taste that is expressed through the
    process of design is emergent, and dependent on the way in which the designer(s)
    use their tools, no matter how automated the process may be. \r\n\r\nThe taste
    that may be appraised by choosing preferences amongst existing types that people
    have seen is somewhat different.\r\nAnd the taste that may be appraised by choosing
    preferences amongst existing fonts that people have used is different again.\r\n\r\nSo
    you are setting yourself an extremely tall order if you expect a generated font
    to be able to recreate the opinions and ideas of the massive.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThere
    is another problem with averaging.\r\nSay you're considering serifs.\r\nIf 40%
    prefer serifs and 60% sans, the average will be a semi-serif, which nobody prefers.\r\nAnd
    it wouldn't be at all representative.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like Averia as it's a nifty little mix of computer science mixed with art
    and the end result is rather interesting in its own way.\r\n\r\nIt is what it
    is and it's interesting and looks nice. But it's not a treatise based on deep
    scientific analysis of the opinions and science of type searching for some profound
    revelation. \r\n\r\nI guess what I'm saying is that your intent may be noble,
    but it's really way out there. I'd step back a bit and first ask yourself what
    problem or question are you trying to solve by figuring out what your classmates
    thing about what defines 'average type'?\r\n\r\nMy advice would be to ground it
    a bit. The reason things like Averia worked is *because* of a defined (if not
    arbitrary) subset of data was used. \r\n\r\n(Also, this feels a lot like \"what
    happens when we design by committee\". That question, sadly, has already been
    answered and tends to be answered daily in most corporate settings.)\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\nMy intent is to produce both an average serif
    and an average sans, so the research result would be splitted into the two categories.\r\nI
    like the results of the averia, as the serifs and the sans have morphed into a
    very particular kind of shape (much like a gross version of the Optima corrections),
    but I'd prefer a more 'ordinary' and 'familiar' look.\r\n\r\nI know that actual
    representation of a typographic taste is almost utopic (and the wider the chosen
    subjects, the more utopic the representation gets), but that wasn't the real scope
    of the project.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd really like to realise is to let all the students
    participate by their feedbacks and opinions on my project, but since most of them
    do not have a specific education in type design, they'll naturally refer to existing
    typefaces in order to express their views and opinions.\r\n\r\nI'd like to create
    some sort of memetic and psychological link in between the resulting typeface
    and the final users of the typeface.\r\n\r\nIntermission/further explanation:
    the more I study modern design practices, the more I realise that in a complex
    system like nowadays society, the designer is just an operator among operators,
    while the old creators-to-users system is collapsing fast. This was the first
    spark that brought my attention to the fact that, in order to create a typeface
    that really works for the users-operators (i.e. academy students), I should give
    the highest priority to their feedbacks and needs. As a vast number of those students
    do not really care about type design, the first consideration would be to abandon
    the project, as the final users do not need a specific typeface for them. But
    this year my academy is also finally establishing a visual identity of his own,
    after fifty years of basically lying in a 'identity limbo', and in my opinion
    a typeface is a very important part of the visual identity of an academy where
    a good number of students do study type design, whether they care or not."
