  traced in Illustrator. It's probably one of my best pieces of custom type drawn
  to this date, I've established a partnership with John Langdon and am going to start
  drawing a lot more type. I'll be sure to post up what I'm working on, it's amazing
  how fast my sketch pads are filling up now. Preview below and PDF attached for further
  inspection!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/patrice_6641.png]"

  body: "mk2: That's the beauty of custom type, creating a few letterforms that relate
    to each other in a special way and only in that way/order. I'd rather do 20 (most
    probably more) different pieces of custom type in the time it would take to make
    one complete typeface. :o)\r\n\r\nHere's the drawing in case anyone's interested
    in seeing the process. It's not perfect, as I'm still learning, but my skills
    are getting there!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/patrice_final_6581.jpg]"
