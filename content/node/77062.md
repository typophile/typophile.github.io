  Basic will soon be released in the Google font directory. I am also working on Expletus
  Serif, but I just need to work on something new and exciting. So I started off closing
  the gaps in Expletus Sans. Nick Shinn already pointed out to me I should do that,
  but I was stubborn. Yes Nick, you were right. Anyhow, 'just closing some gaps' (it's
  not that easy off coarse) wasn't satisfying enough. First off all I want it to become
  very readable. Secondly, I want it to be very readable ON Screen, for web use on
  small sizes. Since @font-face I am disappointed with the number of rivals for Verdana
  (readable at small sizes). So, naive as I am, I decided to give it a go myself.
  I'll upload a picture of how it performs in a few weeks in the critique section.
  To get to the point, I would like to know if any of you have some good information
  or links on what makes a typeface perform well on screen.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper
  de Waard"

    if you want it to work as screen type it needs to be as wide as Verdana, the x-height
    needs to be as high as Verdana, and the apertures need to be as big as Verdana.
    And, of course, have it hinted by experts. \r\n\r\nBut a little advice: don\u2019t
    get hung up on technical stuff this early in your font design career. I feel like
    I made a mistake by getting wrapped up in stuff like language support, big families,
    legibility, OpenType, scripting, etc.. Doing that stuff is really tough without
    a solid foundation in creating good looking fonts without bells and whistles.
    Right now I have several type families in development that took far too long because
    of this. I\u2019m going to get them done and just focus on simple stuff for a
    year or two. Do yourself a favor and don\u2019t get into this position \u2014just
    work on the basics for a few years."

  body: "Good point James.\r\n(I've got some single-style faces in the works.)\r\nNonetheless,
    I still say that it makes practical sense to conceive of a sans typeface from
    Thin to Black from the outset.\r\nBecause fleshing out missing weights later,
    especially at the extremes, is a horrible hassle. "

    agree with you there. But I also think it\u2019s probably best to learn to design
    them independently before worrying about them as extremes in a family."

  body: "I don't do this because I think I have to learn it, or because I think it
    will be great succes. I do this because it's fun. And to be honest with you. Expletus
    Sans Text only has auto otf hinting, but IMO reads almost as comfortable as verdanana.
    When I opened up verdana (pre-instaled on my mac) in fontlab, I was surprised
    to see it didn't have any hints. Does that mean hints aren't necessary at all?
    If my font works well [[http://somadesign.ca/projects/fontfriend|here]] does that
    mean it will work likewise in most other browsers and operating systems? It almost
    seems as if Fontfriend does the spacing and hinting automatically, but that seems
    rather impossible.\r\n\r\nI don't see why one should learn to draw the weights
    independantly. If you can make a black, you can make a bold, I would say.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for some good points guys!"

    are a Mac user, aren't you? Unfortunately, what you are seeing may be representative
    for what designers will see on OSX, but not for what the majority of internet
    users will see on Windows. Rasterization of OTFs, and unhinted OTFs in particular,
    is far from ideal on Windows, especially Windows XP which is still the most popular
    version: <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp\" target=\"_blank\">statistics

    year, I hope that users of Windows XP will update to Windows 7 which offers much
    improved font rasterization ..."

    ;) this is the Adobe head- in- the-sand approach to the problem, I think. Why
    windows needs or ever needed any hinting is rapidly spinning up to a fontnado,
    a typocane, or a typhoont, I can never remember which.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Jasper,
    if you follow your own work, whatever problems it leads you to, those are the
    problems you should learn to understand and design solutions for. In this case,
    I think you are going in a good direction, looking at Verdana to learn about good
    screen font design. While you are looking, closely study the relationship of Verdana
    to Verdana bold, in addition to what DT said I preach already.\r\n\r\nI'm certainly
    looking forward to seeing your design on Google and would be glad to help you
    get it hinted when that time comes, if you have questions.   "

    The fact that xp doesn't rasterize fonts so well really changes the matter. I
    guess autohinting won't work in that case -.- Perhaps I can develop this typeface
    very slowly, so that it's finished when most people have upgraded to Windows 7.
    Although windows 7 doesn't bring many improvements, microsoft will probably find
    a way of forcing their customers to upgrade, or the customers will shift to Mac

    IE7 which uses cleartype. 30% uses IE 8, 12% uses IE 7, 8% is a mac user (I assume
    they don't use IE), and 29% has Windows 7 (out of that 29%, I assume around 14%
    doesn't use IE, so we can add 15% to the total.)\r\n\r\nThis makes: 30+12+8+15=65%
    of the world internet users has properly rasterized fonts. This number gets bigger
    every month, as Mac gets more popular and many Xp users will upgrade Windows 7.\r\n\r\nThis
    all might not make a lot of sense to some of you, but if I'm right, only 35% (getting
    less by the month) has problems with .otf fonts on the web at small sizes.\r\n\r\nJust
    trying to look at the bright side of things ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Be careful with such statistics. IE7/8, on XP or Vista, <a href=\"http://typekit.com/fonts/crimson#browse-browser-samples\">doesn't</a>
