  body: "I like the M treatment a lot. It is unique and relates well to the concept
    of minimalism.\r\n\r\nHowever mixing the uppercase M into lowercase text is visually
    disturbing. When the label is read, the eye first catches the leading M and the
    \"minimal\" is perceived as an uppercase text. Then there's a visual break after
    \"L\" and a lowercase part starts. Something like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yadda_3626.png]\r\n\r\n.\r\nSo
    the resulting impression is that the text is set in two parts - uppercase and
    lowercase - which have the same vertical size. This looks strange and not exactly
    visually pleasing. \r\n\r\n"

    put your finger right on it. What would it look like for the rest to be small
    caps (rather than lowercase)?\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "M treatment does look nice, but I think it doesn't play well with this logo
    because lower case letters tend to be round. Because Ms have cut outs they are
    even more sharp than normal.\r\n\r\nIt's also quite distracting that \"al\" are
    stronger/heavier compared to other letters. So the whole logo does look nice to
    some degree but it should be finished properly.\r\n\r\nSomeone else's comment
    on having upper case letters to represent minimalism does hold water here. I guess.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
