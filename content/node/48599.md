  a long time, but with no luck.\r\n\r\nIf I remember rightly it was based on old
  french theatre posters, and the elements at each side of the crown are also part
  of the font set.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FILTH-LogoRGB_5918.jpg]"
