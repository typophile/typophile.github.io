  guess is the top one would be Trade Gothic? Yea? Nay? \r\nUnsure of the bottom.
  Your help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

    Gothic]].\r\nHard to say for the serif as it's very small. I guess you could fairly
    approximate it using [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond/|Garamond Pro]]
    and switching numerals to proportional figures ([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond/adobe-garamond-bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/505942/242|/1]])."

  body: "Ryuk, thank you for your reply. I'm going to look at proportional figures
    and research it a bit more. Garamond Pro looks close, however the P is open at
    the bottom of the loop (lobe?). American Garamond is close too but the R is different
    on the stems. \r\n\r\nI'll keep looking."
