  if it is. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I absolutely love the Y in Lithos, it is perfect for incorporating
  into a logo. However, the rest of the characters don't fit in. Can anyone recommend
  any similar fonts that have a y, that basically looks like to arms reaching out
  (apologies, best way I could explain).\r\n\r\nAt this stage I am open to either
  serif or sans-serif, I am trying to give the font a friendly, yet traditional feel,
  sort of like a hybrid between the two if possible. \r\n\r\nI may have to find a
  suitable font, then adapt the y to get it to have a friendly, arms opening feel,
  I just thought if anyone knew of any fonts to start with, it would be here.\r\n\r\nAppreciate
  any help.\r\n\r\nThanks"
