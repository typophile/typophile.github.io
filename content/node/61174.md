  body: the fact that any click on the first page redirects you to a site with a different
    format is troubling. there can easily be a way to accomodate the rest of the pages
    in the same structure as the homepage. and as far as the typefaces are concerned,
    (its stupid to be so specific, but still) i'd probably like to see, links in trebuchet
    with text in georgia.

  body: I love the first page. LOVE! But I think the other pages need to follow that
    design more. They don't seem very connected to the first page.
