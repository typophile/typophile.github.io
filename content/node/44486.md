  'Advertising & Design'? currently i am using lacuna regular. But i dont think it

  body: "Sorry\u2026 this isn't really specific to your question, but at small sizes
    (e.g. logotype on business card at 2-3cm wide) there is no way that 'Advertising
    & Design' is going to be legible, regardless of the typeface you choose.\r\n\r\nRoss"
