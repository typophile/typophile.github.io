  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>okey,
i wanted to make my own font for my own albums
and since i moved to snow leopard and only had fontlab available
so i installed it</p>
<p>but it was slightly more difficult when it came to dealing with nodes (points)</p>
<p>for example</p>
<p>1 when i want to re-connect two individual points with a line, in fontographer i was able to do it simply with pentool but in fontlab this pentool method seem to work very rarely..</p>
<p>2 when i want to get rid of the line that connects two dots, in fontographer, i was able to do it simply slicing the line, creating an additional dot in between and delete that, and the two points become disconnected.. but in fontlab when i do that nothing happens or if i erase a point :-0 it turns into a weird curve connecting previous dots :-0 i can&rsquo;t even cut the line simply!</p>
<p>3 to merge points in font lab, i witnessed that i have to draw a dot somewhere else and then drag it on top of a desired point.. :-0 this was far too laborious for a lazy-ass herniated disc condition suffering turtle like me&hellip;</p>
<p>4 there wasnt a shortcut for aligning the dots :-0 grr!</p>
<p>5 it froze too often :-0 especially when doing metrics test thingy.. maybe rosetta issue..</p>
<p>but there were pros too</p>
<p>1 i liked the exact point parametres / properties so that i can be more mathematically accurate when it comes to refninng the geometrics of the whole thing..</p>
<p>2 i liked not bothering to have tangent or different types of curve points (although this might be a downer when it comes to refining the lines though)</p>
<p>but overall.. i felt that i have to go through a lot of complex process to do really simple things.. and i got a bit of headache and lost that momentary impulses which i find is important.. i guess i still have to get used to it but i was wondering&hellip; what&rsquo;s your view on this situation?</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m really hoping that there could be a tool that can have the intuitive drawing capability of both fontographer and illustrator at once have numeric precision and control that fontlab provides
so that i could minimise the useless process figuring something out for hours just to connect two simple lines the right way :-0 but focus more on just the composition, proportions of things..</p>
<p>so far the processes and tools that i am aware of are-</p>
<p>using head!
pencil and paper! sketch!
illustrator
fontographer
typetool?
fontlab</p>
<p>have a nice day
hun</p>

<li>
<p>Use the knife tool to add a node, then RIGHT CLICK (or SHIFT+CLICK) the node: the Contextual Menu has an option to BREAK CONTOUR.</p>

<p>No, you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Select nodes, RIGHT CLICK and select ALIGN NODES</p>
