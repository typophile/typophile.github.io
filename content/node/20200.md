  body: I'm obviously a novice but Californian Text has the numerals on the line instead
    of dipping below or straddling the line.  Californian SC has the numerals as per
    the .jpg above.

    as opposed to \"lining figures\" which are flush with the baseline.\r\n\r\nCentaur
    has osf in their expert set - that's your font."

      shown, the letters would be in Cloister and the numbers in Centaur Expert?\r\n\r\nIf
      so, is there any way to \"combine\" the letters of one and the numerals of the
      other into a single font?"

  body: Centaur is a beaut. But it drives me crazy that they don't have a caps/small
    caps set like Bembo. It means that if you have a style sheet for the small caps
    you have to manually correct all the initial caps (or make a separate style sheet
    just for them). Fournier has the same problem.

    body: "Sorry - that's right.\r\n\r\nBut I like Centaur's letters and Centaur Expert's
      numerals.\r\n\r\nMy question is: can one \"integrate\" the Centaur letters and
      the Centaur Expert numerals into a single font or when editing, does one have
      to change all the Centaur numerals to Centaur Expert?\r\n\r\nAgain, many thanks."
