  Melody Since 1982\" in the image below?\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nIt looks almost
  like a regular font (like Hightower, etc), but the alignment of the letters on the
  baseline seems to differ just slightly (or something...), making it have a bit of
  a handwritten feel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bg-head_3678.png]\r\n\r\nTHANKS!!"
