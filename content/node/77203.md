  used once, in this wonderful 1985 edition of Lucian's stories and dialogues, produced
  by Franz Greno. \r\n\r\nAs far as I know, this face hasn't been digitized yet, which
  is a shame, as the digital Didots currently available have a stroke contrast way
  too high to be useful for longer stretches of text...  \r\n\r\nbest\r\nNils.\r\n\r\n<img

    punches cut by Vafflard around 1780), I agree that a contemporary rendition of
    a Didot-text type would be useful. In the meantime, the digital type that resembles
    most your sample seems to be Fayon:\r\n\r\nhttps://ourtype.com/#/try/fayon/"

  body: "Series N\xBA 27 (Neo Didot) had a Cyrillic (\u2018Russian\u2019) version.
    I don\u2019t know when it was developed. A lot of books in USSR and world-wide
    were set in Neo Didot. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1904_5589]\r\nNeo
    Didot was so popular that around 1940 its Soviet clone was developed, Obyknovennaya
    Novaya Garnitura (\u2018Ordinary New Typeface\u2019). It was custom-designed for
    the <a href=\"http://www.rarete.ru/order.php?dname=book&id=332\">4th edition</a>
    of Lenin\u2019s <em>Collected Works</em> (its 1st volume was printed in 1941,
    and the last one, 39th, in 1967). That typeface was later <a href=\"http://www.gostedu.ru/26805.html\">released
    for general use</a>. It is now offered in digital form by ParaType, under the
    name <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/New-Standard.htm\">New Standard</a>.\r\n<dl>

  body: "thanks everyone for your replies! Fayon looks great indeed; I particularly
    love its italics. As for New Standard -- this just how invaluable a few real people's
    advice is, compared to WhatTheFont, which didn't come up with New Standard even
    though it's in MyFonts' database. I'll go check out that Lenin edition you mentioned;
    I'm sure there's a few copies in Berlin's libraries...\r\n\r\nITC Bodoni has been
    a long-time favorite of mine; in its category, it's probably the most accessible
    and reader-friendly face I've worked with so far.\r\n\r\n@Nick: I'm glad to hear
    \xBBstroke value\xAB mentioned by a pro, as I've always thought this is only what
    non-pros do (hoping to emulate good old ink squash). So I never even tried it,
    as I'm a non-pro myself, trying to avoid anything that's only done by non-pros
    :) ...are you suggesting this is a serious option, or even a standard procedure
    in book production? Same goes for the artificial \xBBbold\xAB feature found in
    font editors. Of course one could apply a tiny (vertical) bit of it, to fatten
    up the hairlines, but I can't imagine the results to look anything but awful --
    I might be wrong though; maybe I'm just too old-fashioned..."

  body: "Nils, I believe one should trust the judgement of one's own eyes, and experiment
    rather than operate blindly on someone else's principle, even if it is commonly
    held.\r\n\r\nI first used the Stroke feature to strengthen type when creating
    small caps in InD and Quark, for typefaces where there were none.\r\nI combined
    it with adjustments to tracking and horizontal scaling.\r\n\r\nCheating has been
    going on in typography for aeons: shaving metal type to squeeze in justification,
    for instance.\r\n\r\nI'm wary of faux bold, a little bit is OK, but the more it's
    used, the more \"cleaning up\" that needs to be done afterwards..\r\n\r\n\"Stroke\"
    is the basis of how type designers make \"grades\" and optical sizes."
