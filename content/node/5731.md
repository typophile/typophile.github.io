  body: This bears some resemblance to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/extension-rr/bold-italic/testdrive.html?s=ABCDEFGHIJKLM&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Extension Bold Italic</a> from Red Rooster. It&#39;s not exact
    but has the same feel. I hope this helps.

  body: James, that is SO close that it could be a version of the same font. The differences
    are rather minor ones, as if the original &#40;Extension&#41; was refined to produce
    the type in the sample. If Les Usherwood didn&#39;t do them both, I hope whoever
    did had permission from his estate.

  body: It also has an eery resemblance to a heavy weight of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-advert/bold/testdrive.html?s=abcdefgpqhijkGJKMW&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">FF Advert</a> that has been slanted. The M &amp; W are the most
    different, and the dots on the i&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Is there an italic for Advert
    in the works?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to play with this image and see if I can
    show you what it looks like slanted.

  body: 'Great insight, Mike. Red Rooster&#39;s version credits Usherwood as a designer.
    Does anyone sell a digital version of the original Extension? '

  body: Here is the slanted Advert sample. A bit similar, I guess, but not the same
    by any means. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41276.gif"

    target="_blank">Formata Italic</a>. <BR> <BR>Here there are enough similarities
    too, including the dots on the i &amp; j. <BR> <BR>Maybe I&#39;m starting to hallucinate.

  body: Wow - Formata bold italic is close and FF Advert was too. I just rang Fontshop
    Australia and they have had a whole heap of new releases but no italic weights
    of FF Advert. Thanks Mike and everyone for taking up the challenge <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
