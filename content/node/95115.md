  body: "In my limited experience, three-dimensional software makes it a no-brainer.\r\n\r\nXara
    3-D USED to be pretty good, but Corel managed to firetruck it up pretty good\u2014as
    they did with WordPerfect AND the star of their fleet.\r\n\r\nWhich reminds me:
    does ANYONE have an installable version 10 available at a decent price? Which
    means \u201Ccheap\u201D\u2026\r\n\r\nA figure I will not divulge until I am pretty
    sure that I don't spell out C-H-E-A-P a little higher than you do. If you catch
    my drift\u2026"
