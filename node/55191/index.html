made a small vacations during last weekend and found a small library with some old books. Here are some photos to share...
In one picture you can see double apostrophe in the begin of the sentence. Anyone here knows the meaning?
Enjoy.

Ricardo, "Quotation marks began to appear in printed works in 17th century England." I think I've seen them in earlier portuguese printings but i'm not sure... i'll try to find some examples, i'll also try to find out when they stoped being used like this, repeatedly in every line. I'm curious now, thanks António!</div>

One of them (Obsequio) as the date printed on cover (1739)
The rest I dont know...
I can tell you where the books are if you want to study it better: Centro Bibliográfico e Documental Prof. Doutor Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in Celorico de Basto.

This can be found even in rather new British books like James Mill's <em>Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind</em> of 1896 (pp. 151-162).
What is funny is that the author of the article considers it as "distracting" -- looking at how we quote in email I cannot think of anything more contemporary ...&nbsp;&nbsp;:)</div>

One thing I found interesting was seeing the tilde placed over the 'o', as in the word "coraçaõ" (first line of top sample). The current orthography is to place the tilde over the 'a', like "coração". I could swear that in primary school we were taught to position the diacritic between the 'a' and the 'o'. This would actually make sense because 'ão' needs to be read as a nasalized diphthong, and having the tilde between the two letters would emphasize the fact that it's not just the 'a' that is accented/nasalized. I guess the diacritic gradually migrated West :^)

Speaking of old Portuguese books, some time ago I started a thread here on Typophile (which is impossible to find right now) about the [[http://purl.pt/index/geral/PT/index.html|Biblioteca Nacional Digital]]. It's a site that is definitely worth exploring, especially the [[http://purl.pt/index/monog/PT/index.html|Old Book (Livro Antigo) section]].</div>

Miguel, you should work on multiple letter tildes for your next font.  Not just double but triple and quadruple.... they used to be used :)

		<div class="commentbody">"(whose book designs tend to mirror that of Portugal)" Guifa, actually, it's the other way round. For many decades, all that we had here in Portugal came from Spain, typographers, types, matrices... even the German ones were first established in Spain, before coming here... mainly from Salamanca I think.

The books in CV at the moment have different formats depending on the rights and digitization method used.  For the facsimile editions, there is thankfully a pattern to the file names so I just write a script to download it and place into a PDF on my own.  Quality can vary but the more recent scans tend to be of higher quality (I've found a few that are black and white 1 bit scans of manuscripts -- impossible to read for me)

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">It's not a J.  But historically it was a slight upward diagonal, a long horizontal, and another slight upward diagonal.  This was necessary because it was placed over multiple letters at once:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oldlongtilde_3777.png]

Overtime, it began to just be used to represent a deleted n or m: capitane --> capitãe (Sp. capitán).  In Spanish at least, there was no real rhyme or reason, it was just a space saver.  I'm not as current on Portuguese linguistics to know its history as marking nasality.  Also in Spanish you encounter a lot the q with a tilde, which abbreviates "que" (hence aunq~ = aunque).

It's because of this history that I prefer tildes that overall are flat or slightly rising.  There are a lot of fonts that have it essentially dropping which I don't like and I'd consider personally improperly made, but I don't say that with any authority other than historical precedence :)  Things are changing of course.
