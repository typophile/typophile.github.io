  of an client&#39;s handwriting. So far I made a template for the artist to write
  in each character. Budget is only allows for 8 hours billable. I know this is properly
  not enough time, but will be making it up on the site which is the next job. I am
  used to doing it the long and hard way with letter by letter, but can&#39;t afford
  the time. Any suggestions for short cuts. How about a link to a company that can
  do this. I want to see what is offered in the current market for this sort of work.
  I think FontShop used to do it but I can&#39;t find it on their site any more. '
