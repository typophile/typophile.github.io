  school teacher and pro-surfer before be began his career as a Typographer. His first
  graphic design book, The End of Print, is the highest selling graphic design book
  of all time, selling over 200,000 copies and printed in 5 different languages. Carson
  pushes the limits on both graphic design and typography. He experiments in new ways
  of communication through his designs and uses a variety of different mediums. He
  is a very inspirational designer and continues to follow his intuition to drive
  his work. \r\n\r\nCheck him out at DavidCarsonDesign.com "

    not to show up. \r\nHe has a record of two decades of not showing up for his agreed
    appointment."

    as \r\na guest lecturer!\r\n\r\nit might be cool to begin a bit of carson-esque
    type in your work and then\r\nwe can talk all about the cool type by that inspirational
    designer j. strong!!"

  body: "Tomi, now I feel less special: for the Thessaloniki conference of 2002 (or
    was it 2004?) Carson canceled, then rescheduled at the last minute, causing a
    $6000 first class ticket to be bought, then canceled again.* The good news is
    that Spiekermann and Brody did a superb job filling in - much more satisfying
    than when I saw Carson speak at... I think it was ATypI99 (where a gaggle of fawning
    wannabes lined up for an audience afterwards).\r\n\r\n* This type of behavior
    reinforces my view that on the Art--Design axis Carson is closer to the former.
    Design is essentially about <em>other people</em>.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
