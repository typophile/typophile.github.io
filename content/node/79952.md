body: "Can anyone advise as to a \"best practices\" when managing the fonts on one's
  system?\r\nI am going bonkers these days trying to manage all my typefaces. I use
  Linotype's Font Explorer, but it doesnt seem to do the job or i am doing something
  wrong. Of particular frustration is when running into multiple versions of one typeface
  (i.e. Futura \u2014 I have cuts from several different foundries and have to use
  them on different jobs, so i cant just trash the others\u2014 i turn them on and
  off as needed). And secondly, is there an alternative to Font Explorer? Do any of
  these Font Management Systems really beat all the others? Or are they all just the
  same? Which one is truly the BEST? Surely someone on Typophile can answer this?"

    forebears and newer Pro-version) around 12 years, before I switched to FontAgentPro
    (on account of switching to OS X), which has been exemplary in daily use. \r\n\r\nBest
    practices always starts out by weeding out the bad apples amongst your font files,
    which can be quite a task, but is imperative."

  body: "For many years I would always start every new system software upgrade (Mac
    System 6x onwards) by stripping out the contents of the System Font folder down
    to the bare minimum \u2013 those fonts required by the system  only \u2013 and
    managing the font libraries elsewhere on the hard drive with a third-party solution
    like Suitcase or MasterJuggler. The ability to create font sets grouped and named
    for specific accounts/clients/jobs was a huge boost to productivity everywhere.\r\n\r\nAfter
    Mac OS X, things got more complicated, and Extensis, makers of Suitcase Fusion,
    produced a .pdf booklet called Font Management in OS X Best Practices Guide. It's
    recommended reading. I have a 5th edition which dates from 2009, but I suspect
    you can find it on their site still.\r\n\r\nFor the last couple of years I have
    been using <a href='http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontcase/'> Fontcase </a>
    which is just great \u2013 very affordable, with a slick interface and pretty
    robust."
