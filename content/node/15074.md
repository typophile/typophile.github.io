  body: The font on the right is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times/bold/testdrive.html?s=AMERICAN+CAPITAL&p=48">Times
    Bold</a>. The one on the left seems to be modified from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bembo/bembo/testdrive.html">Bembo</a>,
    or maybe started out as Bembo, but is several generations removed from the original
    artwork.
