  logo used in the 30s I believe, and the right one is from the 40s.\r\n\r\nI think
  it's funny that the right logo looks like the illuminati symbol.."

  body: The one on the first and fourth lines in the logo on the left is an old typeface
    called Latienisch. I don't know of any digital version. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/familytree.html">Romana</a>
    is very similar, but doesn't have the little serif on the top-left of the "A".

  body: Thanks Mark. Anyone else who has got a clue? I know there's a couple of fonts
    used here, so it's a challenge...
