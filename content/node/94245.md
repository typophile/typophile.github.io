  you consider the platformID = 3 (Windows fonts) on both results, you'll see that
  the \"MS Mincho\" font shows correctly, names for the encodingID = 1 (Unicode BMP
  UCS-2) and 10 (Unicode UCS-4). But the \"Cambria Math\" font only shows encodingID
  = 1. It doesn't show the encodingID = 10 names. I know for sure the \"Cambria Math\"

    see those in the version I have.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's not necessary for a font
    to contain enc.10 names even if it <em>does</em> contain an encoding 10 in the
    cmap. Of that, the specs say\r\n\r\n<blockquote>... If the font is meant to support
    supplementary Unicode characters, it will additionally need a Format 12 subtable
    with a platform encoding ID 10. ...</blockquote>\r\n\r\n... and these supplementary
    characters are typical for a CJK font but not for a math font. Hold on, I'm going
    to check what cmap encodings are in Cambria Math.\r\n\r\n(Edit) Okay, Cambria
    Math also contains a 3/10 encoding, so that's not the reason.\r\n\r\nWell, I cannot
    recall from the specs that says every cmap encoding needs to have a corresponding
    name entry."

    (it also has a format 14 subtable, the first I've had to make)) but the name table
    entries do not make use of any of these characters.\r\n\r\nOr am I misunderstanding
    your question?\r\n\r\nPS. What tool are you using to examine the table entries?
    Are you able to look within a TTC, or are you breaking the Cambria TTC apart somehow?"

    your replies.\r\n\r\n@John Hudson\r\n\r\n>> No, this isn't a bug. My understanding

    subtables that cover the encoding needs of text set in the font. <<\r\n\r\nI have
    to disagree with you on this John. Take for example the fonts \"MT Extra\" and
    \"Symbol\". These are symbol fonts as you probably know, and so, none of their
    \"characters\" will ever be present in the <cite>name</cite> table. Nevertheless,
    the encodingID = 0 is the only one present in this table for both fonts, for all
    platforms. Also, if you consider the fonts that have Unicode points above 0xFFFF,
    all of them, as far as I know, have encodingID = 10 present in their <cite>name</cite>
    tables for the Windows platform, with the exception of the \"Cambria Math\" font.
    My feeling is that this a bug, although a minor one, as you really don't need
    this information in the <cite>name</cite> table.\r\n\r\n>> PS. What tool are you
    using to examine the table entries? Are you able to look within a TTC, or are
    you breaking the Cambria TTC apart somehow? <<\r\n\r\nI have developed a small
    C++ program to parse this <cite>name</cite> table for any font specified by the
    user.\r\n\r\n@Theunis de Jong\r\n\r\n>> John, does that mean that the Encoding
    10 name entry in MS Mincho actually contains these supplementary characters? <<\r\n\r\nIf
    you look at the names for the MS Mincho font on the screen shot above, you'll
    notice that there are characters that were printed as invalid. I presume those
    characters correspond to this encoding in the MS Mincho font. But there is one
    thing here I didn't understand : I used the font Arial to print the reports shown
    on those windows. As far as I can understand, the function TextOut() that I used
    to print those lines, should print the correct japanese characters, by just using
    the font fallback mechanism present in the Windows API. But apparently, that didn't
    happen ! Why ?\r\n"

    contrary to the spec and/or produce unwanted behaviour. To my knowledge, neither
    is the case here. If it is so that other fonts containing supplementary plane
    coverage in their cmap tables also provide encodingID 10 name table encoding,
    I'm much more inclined to see this as unnecessary bytes in those fonts than as
    bug in Cambria Math."

    But then, how do you justify the encodingID = 0 for the MT Extra and Symbol fonts
    ?\r\n\r\nThere is one other thing that surprised me in relation to the  \"msmincho.ttc\",
    the TTC font file for the MS Mincho font. The TTC header present in this file
    is as follows :\r\n\r\nTTC Tag               ttcf\r\nversion                 0001
    0000\r\nnumFonts            0002\r\nOffsetTables[0]    0000 0020 [1]     0000
    018C\r\nulDsigTag            DSIG\r\nulDsigLength      0000 1B98\r\nulDsigOffset
    \       0099 59FC\r\n\r\nFrom this [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otff.htm|Open
    Type spec]] you'll find this assertion : \"There are two versions of the TTC Header:
    Version 1.0 has been used for TTC files without digital signatures. Version 2.0
    can be used for TTC files with or without digital signatures -- if there's no
    signature, then the last three fields of the version 2.0 header are left null.\"\r\n\r\nShouldn't
    then the version number for this font collection be 0002 0000, instead of 0001
    0000 ?\r\n"

    font made by anyone. It looks, based on your description of these and other fonts,
    as if either Monotype or Microsoft may at one time have had a policy to include
    a name table encodingID to match cmap coverage, regardless of whether this was
    actually needed in the name table entries."
