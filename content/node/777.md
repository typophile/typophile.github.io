    the library or librarian should be able to help you get a book about it.  <BR>
    <BR>I spent last weekend trying a hand at binding. its kind&#39;a relaxing...beats
    the knitting club <BR> <BR>here&#39;s a site I just found though - with instructions:
    http://www.sff.net/people/Brook.West/bind/bindit.html <BR> <BR>there&#39;s a note
    at the bottom mentioning &#60;i&#62;For more information on Japanese bookbinding,
    including decorative bindings, how to make cloth covered hard covers, making cloth
    covered boxes, and other useful techniques, check your library for Japanese Bookbinding:
    Instructions from a Master Craftsman, by Kojiro Ikegami &#40;published by John
    Weatherhill&#41;. &#60;/i&#62;'
