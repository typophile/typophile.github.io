  like a dumbed down version of [[http://typetester.org|http://typetester.org]], but
  with dozens of typefaces rendered at once and without any Flash trickery on the
  webpage itself.\r\n\r\nMake sure to read the \"WTF\" (FAQ) page though. Specifically,
  this thing uses fixed database of fonts, but it can be told about other fonts and
  FAQ explains how to do that."
