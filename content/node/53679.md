  not updated on script fonts that have come out recently and was wondering if anybody
  had any tips on their favourite new scripts? It needs to be crisp and simple and
  fun. Fun fun fun!"

    [[http://www.badassideas.com/blog|\"The Spellbinding Scripts of Alejandro Paul\"]]
    \ on her blog. I'm honored to be typing in the same thread as such a talent.\r\n\r\nIn
    years of searching for scripts that aren't just another attempt at digitizing
    classic Spencerian examples or mediocre knock-offs of the glory days of hand lettering,
    his work is astounding. I'm getting out my credit card.\r\n"
