  of my friend, it's somewhat final already, but I think it would be good if I could
  get some feedback/opinion from other person. I'd like to know what might be improved,
  which is I can still do. This might be useful for my upcoming project as well.\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://bit.ly/1H7LIS2\">Here is the link</a>\r\n\r\nI hope some of you could
  give me a constructive feedback, I'm new here, please tell me if anything wrong
  with my post\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/asklausen-1_3678.png]"

  body: After some moments thinking I guess the first character is an a (based on
    looking at the fifth character) but otherwise it is at first look hard to decide
    whether or not it may be a C or an O and I think first look is important . . .
    I am still not sure

  body: "Agree with Anthony about the ambiguity of the first letter. Also, I think
    the bottom unconnected swash is too small to support the whole wordmark (I like
    better the sketches where it\u2019s part of a letter)."

  body: "I agree that the \"a\" is ambiguous. Looking at your sketches, moving the
    gap up would go a long way to resolving that issue and making it clearer. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    when working with handwritten typography, I feel it's important to follow the
    logic of actual handwriting as much as possible since viewer's brains are \"conditioned\"
    to perceive a flow that is familiar to them. When you break that flow or do something
    counter to intuitive expectations, you set yourself up visual discord in the final
    product. The \"a\" is an example of that...the natural break is where the stroke
    is reversed, up at the top, not in the middle.\r\n\r\nRelated to that, the \"s\"'s
    look odd to me since they are not not cursive. I think the cursive \"s\" letters
    in your sketches work better, although perhaps since the client chose a different
    version you don't have a choice.\r\n\r\nI'm also not comfortable with the left-leaning
    tabs or \"ears\" that you've put atop the ascenders. They run counter to the flow
    and energy of the graphic. I think you'd be better off, with a cleaner result,
    if you left them off and just left the tops slanted down to the right.\r\n\r\nLastly,
    the variation in the vertical height of the letters seems a bit off to me. It
    gives a \"bumpy\" quality to the mark. While I assume the point was to inject
    some informality to the mark, it does not have the right rhythm to me and ends
    up feeling a bit awkward."
