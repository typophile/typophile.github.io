  I should mention that I am from [[New Zealand]], which is a very, very young country.
  The only time I see blackletter faces around here are for fashion labels (on the
  goth bandwagon) and heavy metal record covers. Or not-heavy-metal-record-covers
  that are being ironic. The covers are mostly foreign (i.e. American, British) anyway.\r\n\r\nOh
  right, and on newspaper titles.\r\n\r\nSo, where else arethey be used?\r\n\r\n-

  body: 'Welcome to Typophile, Don! <BR> <BR>I certainly agree with you that Blackletter
    is a rich, and varied medium, which can be used just like any other tool for the
    right purpose. However, I disagree with two other things that you mentioned in
    your post. <BR> <BR>First, the second world war has everything to do with the
    decline of blackletter as a used typeface style&#40;s&#41;. Blackletter today
    serves a number of decorative roles in design and society. But pre-1930, it was
    used for a wider scope of design roles. Today, most Germans avoid Blackletter
    like the plague, because they associate it with Nazism &#40;and people&#39;s assumptions
    are often more powerful and convincing that the truth&#41;. This reaction is especially
    true in younger Germans, in my experience, even among graphic designers &#40;who
    should know their type history better&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Books just aren&#39;t printed
    with Blackletter types anymore, neither in Germany nor elsewhere. Blackletter
    may still be seen the world over &#40;even in Germany, especially on things that
    are supposed to look old, or on beer labels&#41;, but it has been relegated to
    a much less significant, and more superficial place. <BR> <BR>Secondly, it wasn&#39;t
    Claude Garamond in c.1540 who struck the death-blow to Blackletter as text in
    non-Germanic countries, but rather the duo of German printers and Italian patrons
    in the 1460s and 70s. Especially Nicholas Jenson &#40;okay, he wasn&#39;t really
    German, but he was a Gutenberg apprentice in Mainz, I think&#41;. <BR> <BR>The
    Italians never embraced Blackletter printing. Even their more-native Rotunda hands
    didn&#39;t get much press. The Renaissance Humanists wanted &#34;Roman&#34; looking
    letters. They actually got Frankish letters, but they couldn&#39;t tell the difference
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR>
    <BR>They never took to Textura or Schwabacher, like patrons in Germany &#40;and
    Holland, England, Scandinavia, etc&#41; were doing. And by the time that the Holy
    Roman Emperor commissioned the design of Fraktur, there was a stylistic split
    across Europe which would soon become ideological: Luther&#39;s works were solely
    printed with Schwabacher and Fraktur types, making them &#34;Protestant&#34; type.
    A southern Catholic would have used those letters for his books at his peril.'

  body: In my above post, I generalized with the term &#34;southern Catholic.&#34;
    I really meant the countries south of Germany, from 1517 onward. <BR> <BR>I should
    point out as an additional aside that, in Southern &#40;i.e., Catholic&#41; Germany,
    Textura was still used during the Reformation and Counterreformation to set religious
    texts in Latin, and that was OK. After a certain point &#40;I can&#39;t put a
    date on this&#41;, there wouldn&#39;t have been any &#34;Protestant&#34; stigma
    attached to any sort of lettering style within the German-speaking countries;
    I suspect that this was after the Catholic Church in Germany felt comfortable
    enough with the relative success of their Counterreformation. <BR> <BR>However,
    were I a printer in Rome in the 1600s, I would not have tried printing anything
    for the Pope with Fraktur

    German typestyle&#34;&#41;, but think about why they really dumped it: it was

  body: Actually, a fixed pen angle is not required in &#34;Western calligraphy&#34;
    at all, although it does tend to be a norm in most hands from what I can tell.
    The three parameters are translation &#40;movement in the Cartesian plane&#41;,
    rotation &#40;of the pen&#41; and pressure &#40;which releases more ink, with
    the correct type of pen&#41;. In fact, even in hands that are based on a fixed
    angle you get the occasional exception &#40;depending on the letter &#34;skeleton&#34;
    - think of the &#34;z&#34;&#41;, to avoid ungainly results. <BR> <BR>BTW, there&#39;s
    quite an uncanny similarity between certain Celtic manuscript motifs and certain
    Armenian ones, including the famed knotwork... And from what I understand there
    are at least two scholars working to figure this out. <BR> <BR>hhp
