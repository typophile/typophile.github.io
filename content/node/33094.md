body: "I have a conundrum which I am sure is easily solved... Is there was using InDesign
  that you have a background colour (white) to the text. When I say this, I dont mean
  for the whole text box, but only for where the text is, so the background colour
  is only present when there is a character present... i have attached a very poor
  picture to show what i mean. \r\n\r\nAnd while I'm posting, any ideas for two typefaces
  to work together for the setting of Wagner's Der Ring Des Nibelungen??? I would
  like a serif for the libretti, and a sans for stage directions... I also need something
  for the story which will be presented in novel format........\r\n\r\nAny ideas would
  be great! thanks thanks!\r\n\r\nclaire\r\n&8"

    Just highlight the text, then choose underline options in the drop down menu in
    the character palette. Set the underline color to white (or whichever color you
    want behind the text), then play with the pt size and offset until you create
    your desired effect.\r\n\r\nps: my first post! :)"

  body: "When I want color under my text I set the type and then draw boxes on a layer
    underneath using pre-measured blocks to ensure that all the boxes are the same
    size relative to the text.\r\n\r\nAs for Der RIng, it should relate to the specific
    production if for public consumption, if for actors/singers to read, just pick
    something legible like you would for any text. "

  body: "I agree with the solution James has proposed, actually, for the boxes --
    for starters, it lets you mess around with the box edges, so they don't have to
    look like correcting type strips. \r\n\r\nAs for suitable typefaces, the proprietors
    and creators of various foundries will soon give you a vast selection, which you
    can evaluate on your own....  ;-)"

  body: As always, it's a trade-off, Tim.  One could easily use letterjay's process
    for the initial layout (particularly if there's going to be much messing around
    with text content!), and then switch to make the boxes sing and dance a bit.

    it seemed to work fine, BUT then I decided to do the whole thing by hand! Its
    going to take a long time I feel!\r\n\r\nThanks for all your help!! ~ Typefaces
    I chose were DIN light and Spectrum Regular.... Havn't decided upon the story
    one yet... might stick with spectrum but go semibold/bold....\r\n\r\n<em>thanks
