body: "Hi All\r\n\r\nSome of you have seen this logo before; I posted the first incarnation
  a few months ago and got wonderful critique. I have tweaked (hopefully not too much)
  and am now happy to present a nearly finished version. Nearly finished because the
  addition of the tagline and its positioning as well as typeface choice is stumping
  me a bit so I would appreciate some input from the typophiles. \r\n\r\nI like the
  tagline following the curve but I am wondering if this is a dated or tacky approach.
  I tried a version with the tag just centered underneath on two lines and I felt
  it just stuck out too much. On the fly I used Century Schoolbook because its weight
  is very similar to the lettering and it has a vintage feel to me that I hope my
  logo conveys. Is this a good choice? Any other suggestions? Also I realize the weight
  of the & is a little off, because I decided to make it smaller to match the height
  of the lower case. I would have to work this out later. \r\n\r\nThe background on
  the logo is that it is for a just-starting-out event planner who helped me on my
  wedding day in September and in return, I have designed this logo for her. She has
  seen the first version but not this one yet.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/olive_with_tag_4221.jpg]"

    fancier would dilute the logo.\r\nYou're right about the &. But I think you could
    try to align it at least at the t height.\r\nWhile beautiful, the logo unfortunately
    lacks the organicity and smoothness of your hand drawn sketches."

    about making the tagline to a nest? At the moment I fear, that the egg falls down
    and breaks. (An olive probably would not break.) Or you could make the tagline
    to a piece of cheese and spear olive and cheese together."

    eggs and black eggs and big eggs. The egg is a very successful invention in evolution.
    It does not matter, that your olive looks like a black egg, because it also looks
    like an olive. And it looks cool, except from the tagline. But someone, that is
    able to create such a nice olive, is also able to integrate the tagline in a better
    way."

    of the olive,set within a pointy-sort-of-black-shape, reminiscent of a toothpick?\r\n\r\nthe
    trick would be not to make it look hokey. although, the best option would somehow
    be to typeset it correctly next to the mark i imagine.\r\n\r\nMight i just say
    that i don't like the word occasions? Events are something special, and maybe
    in reality occasions are too, but to me it sounds like mediocrity. Ya know, I
    smoke a cig on occasion. but tomorrow is  HUGE EVENT!"

- body: evanbrog - Mediocrity? Not really. The word "occasion" is typically reserved
    for gatherings that are less celebratory; like a funeral, wake, postmortem award
    ceremony, or memorial dedication. It's somewhat uncouth to call a such occasions
    a "HUGE EVENT!"

    didn't come up with the \"events and occasions\" part and therefore didn't think

    Occasions sounds like greeting cards to me. What do you think of \"Humble Olive
    Events\"? \r\n\r\nEither way, I don't want to place the tagline in any way to
    make it look like a toothpick or stem. There is possibility of actually using
    an olive colour and I think that's literal enough. I appreciate all the thoughts

  body: "Does it really need the qualifier; \"events and occasion\" locked up to the
    logo?\r\nCan it be known by context and used separately to get the idea across?
    For example, the \"events and occasions\" copy could be part of the description
    in an ad, or even the first line of information in the address block on a business
    card. The thought is, you're going to be in a marketplace that your market will
    know what you do \u2014 people know if you go to restaurant you can order food,
    one doesn't have to advertise \"food sold here.\"\r\n\r\nIf you do decide to keep
    the copy with the logo, the copy \"events and occasion\" as it stands now, locked
    up to the logo, may be too small for reduction. You may want to try it on a business
    card to see how it works. Also, if they plan on embroidery, the smaller type may
    not render nicely.\r\n\r\nBy the way, still a big fan of the hand rendered drawings
    you posted months ago.\r\nNice work:)"

    it just feels more in theme with the rest of the logo and the other feels too

  body: "Still very charming, from a designers perspective i appreciate the hand-drawn,
    it's a personal preference.\r\nAlthough there's one thing that the hand-drawn
    version does better than the latest\u2014the balance of negative space around
    the inside perimeter of the olive to the logotype. it sits more comfortably inside.
    the latest version has a bit too much visual tension around the tops of serifs
    in the \"H\".\r\n\r\nHowever, i still feel that the \"tagline\" is too small in
    comparison to the mark. When the mark is reduced (used small) the \"tagline\"
    appears diminutive and unimportant. \r\n\r\nIs it a tagline or part of the name?\r\ni
    feel it's less of a tagline and more as part of the name. For example, i think
    of fedex's tagline. It was; \"when it absolutely positively has to be there overnight\".
    If you look at Fedex truck today, you'll see the logo with Fedex Ground, Fedex
    Home Delivery, Fedex Freight, etc.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fedex-logo-1_4939.jpg]\r\n\r\nall
    said, i really like the logo and the name. i hope the service will be as good
    as the mark portrays it to be :)\r\nM"
