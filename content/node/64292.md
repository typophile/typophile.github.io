    from 2001. However, as I look more, the counters on your lettering seem a bit
    more squared, like something of Zapf's.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yes, as far as the Roman samples on Identifont, they look identical. In any
    case, I now have Liberation Serif in the Guide, since it was a free font and I
    could download the family of 4 fonts. Full sample from the Serif Guide shown below.
    Thanks Renko.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liberation_serif_full_5205.gif]"
