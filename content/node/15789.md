body: "European Union Directive 71/316/EEC gives official specifications for the estimated
  sign, that is U+212E (\u212E). Can someone tell me about the estimated sign and
  whether or not people use the precise EU specifications for its design (some designers
  clearly ignore it), or is it open to interpretation like the Euro sign, which no-one
  seems to design according to the EU specs.\r\n\r\nThe brief entry on wikipedia here
  gives the 'exact' specifications for the sign: \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Estimated%22_sign\r\n\r\nAre
  there any more sensible specifications that the EU ones which are based on a 1 \xD7
  0.9 ellipse and give decimals (to 3 decimal places) for the other measurements.
  I tried to work it out but there are a couple of measurements that seem to be completely
  arbitrary. Anyone know how the design came about or who the designer was? \r\n\r\nFinally
  what is the approach to spacing the character both vertically and horizontally?"

  body: "Currency symbols are used in-line, often need to be on the figure width,
    and there's a history of making currency symbols match the style and weight of
    the base font. There's no one-size fits all solution. \r\n\r\nUse and placement
    of the estimated symbol seem to be dictated by law, and it's not used in-line
    in continuous text as far as I'm aware, just placed next to the weight on the
    product.\r\n"

  body: I made an estimated sign glyph a few years ago that I have used in all projects
    since. It is based on the EU directive, but I very slightly tweaked it to make
    some optical compensations. Since the sign is pretty generic, I'm happy for people
    to use my glyph in their own fonts. TT and PS font files containing this glyph
    can be downloaded <a href="http://www.tiro.com/John/Estimated.zip">here</a>. I
    usually scale the glyph to match the height of the lining numeral zero.

  body: "At Adobe we briefly flirted with customized estimated signs in pre-release
    fonts, where the design matched the typeface and weight, but we decided that these
    would not meet the legal needs of the EU, and went with the generic design, resized
    to match the numeral height of the typeface (like John's).\r\n\r\nT"
