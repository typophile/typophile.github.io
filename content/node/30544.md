    wallets. The type treatment doesn't really gel with the symbol for me. Upping
    it's weight would help.

    you have an immediate event, like a trade show the new ID must be ready for? If
    not, hold off if you have doubts. When the product is you, the branding has to
    feel just right, or you won't push it confidently.\r\n\r\nUregent event aside,
    whatever you do with the card, sync it with your site, and roll them both out
    at once. It seems to be exclusively a webdev company, so I'd recommend something
    loosely tech related, even if it is subtle. \r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz

    fit better in wallets. LOL I would love a more weighty type, only it is the platinum
    face of the luxury collection and there are no other weights...\r\n\r\nThe opposites
    will be cut like in the draft. I need to pass out cards fairly immediately so
    i will make these even if it is only a temporary identity.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    my site is circa 2 years ago and very out of date. I don't do mostly web design
    anymore but it is still a large part as I do a lot of identity design and marketing.\r\n\r\nYes
    i love really thick GSM cards so the stock will be thick ;) But I don't agree
    that if you sell logos for a living you need your own... "

    adequate' as it really is impossible to design your own logo to a level of perfection
    that suits you.\r\n\r\nSo, that said, I find this logo just fine. Nice, simple.
    Leave it!\r\n\r\nOther comments:\r\n\r\nThe front of the card seems off-center
    vertically. Raise the type and mark up some.\r\n\r\nI agree that the type could
    be a little heavier. I'd maybe put the cross-bar back in for the A. Seems to distract
    from the mark a bit.\r\n\r\nI don't see it as being religious, but it does have
    a bit of a historic vibe to it."

    Aluminum. Unfortunately I can't make it heavier as there are no other weights.
    Rotating it makes it look too much like an X for me, like don't use my services
    or maybe that I'm a pirate... I might try to tweek it a bit though so it looks
    less religious. \r\n\r\nCan anyone guess what the mark is made of?"

    \r\n\r\nBut i do like the feel that there is some kind of history to the mark
    and that it is fairly non representatinal. Except that to me it sort of reminds
    me of the North Star which a lot of people here associate norcal to."

  body: "The tight kerning is making a light patch out of the CAL of NORCAL, have
    you tried adding a stroke to the platinum to see if that helps you increase the
    weight (a method that doesn't always work on lighter weights), if it doesn't lead
    anywhere you might consider just having the mark on the contact side. Your spot
    UV seems to be gradated, I've never done this but it seems to me that it won't
    work as a gradation, perhaps you have seen this, if not I would ask your printer
    if it seems workable.\r\n\r\nTim"

    the letter shapes of your mark as it could affect readability of it.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    not a big fan of black, it looks dirty around white type to me and it\u2019s overpowering.
    Your brand needs to stand out more than the background color of it. Color is a
    very important thing in branding but the relation of logo and branding has to
    work together as one and to me now it\u2019s breaking it apart.\r\n\r\nThose changes
    in shapes on your corners reminds me of such bad reviews the first redesign of
    Quark\u2019s logo got. That shape is an on-going trend that I believe comes from
    that \u201Cweb 2.0\u201D look of making everything with round corners and  gradients.
    Be very careful if this is not your goal.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a sample of business
    card I go. It\u2019s not of my personal taste, to me the black background in this
    case, makes the color more important than the actual content of the card. Some
    may disagree but I just post it so you can see what a black BC looks like.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/felt_bc_5304.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor
    different business card sizes also read this:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/21340\r\n\r\nJust

  body: "tim, what do you mean by a light patch? Also I thought just adding a stroke
    to the letters to give them more weight would detract from their form?\r\n\r\nThere's
    no gradiation for the Spot UV but i might keep the ghost there as Kco sugguested.\r\n\r\nI
    agree there are a lot of setbacks to black cards, especially how easily they get
    dirty, But I want my identity to feel a bit edgy with a marked distinction. I
    think that the thick GSM, narrow cards, opposite rounded corners, UV/Matte combo
    and black stock works well for that.\r\n\r\nI have been collecting well printed
    material and I love black book covers like \"The Elements of Typographic Style\"
    and I love the 7 Diamonds black clothing labels (this is almost the exact matte/smooth
    feel with UV that I am looking for).\r\n\r\nGradients and web 2.0 are definately
    not my goal, though it is a shame how much gets lumped into web 2.0 category,
    \"To define is to limit\" as says Oscar Wilde. I think there is a place for gradients
    and rounded corners and rounded type, etc. in graphic design if used well. I am
    more a fan of bauhaus design myself so i tend to use gradients more sparingly."

    on books such as \"The Elements of Typographic Style\", they have a very thick
    coating, which is to take into account.\r\n\r\nAlso what about bringing your services
    such as: print, web, etc much bigger so they don\u2019t repeat as much not to
    hit them in the heat over and over but to be clear about it? Its only going to
    be a spot so it might work, although it can overpower the identity. You can try
    it maybe not so big so it doesn\u2019t repeat as much\r\n\r\nKco\r\n"

    will try to loosen up the kerning a bit. Isn't adding a stroke kind of like Faux

    edit it or contact Christopher again.\r\n\r\nStrange about the monitors. I am

    well handled it can work, at least it can give you a guide to work to. In this
    case you are not trying to design a font but letter a logo, a subtle difference,
    which really means that you only have to work up a limited number of characters
    and that those characters are only going to interact with those on either side
    of it. However, if you are unconfident it might be best to enlarge the characters
    in proportion to the mark.\r\n\r\nMy taste would be to drop the services and UV
    the logotype, restrained use makes it more \u201Cspecial\u201D.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the monitor I am Mac-biased, (having only rarely used pcs and generally concentrating
    on the different software and OS) so I am probably not the best person to give
    a recommendation, I do prefer my work Diamondtron to my powerbook but with different
    sizes and requirements it is not a fair comparison.\r\n\r\nTim"
