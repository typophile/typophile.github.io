body: '[img:sites/default/files/old-images/met_font_6451.png] This seems pretty close
  to Georgia Pro Black but there are subtle differences in the width of the characters
  and thickness of contours. Does anybody know exactly what this is, if it is in the
  Georgia super-family?'

    I can see is Baskerville 10/120 Pro (Bold/Italic) by Frantisek Storm [2005] -
    see the link bellow.\r\nhttp://www.stormtype.com/family-baskerville-original-pro.html\r\n\r\nThere
    was actually an older version of Baskerville Ten Pro by Storm which has this strange
    /1 on old-style-figures. "
