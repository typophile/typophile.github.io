body: "I'm putting a new shirt up on [[http://www.typographyshop.com|TypographyShop]]\r\n
  for the first time in awhile. I'd love this community's opinion on it and the choice
  of sizes for the word \"counter.\" \r\n\r\nAs I noted in a string of comments on
  our  [[http://www.facebook.com/TypographyShop|Facebook page]], the word \"counter\"
  has more than a couple of meanings. The O? Is it Oprah? The big O? Then the type
  geek wearer gets to explain what it really means.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your
  opinions.\r\n\r\nPatrick\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/countercomparison_5787.jpg]"

  body: "Maybe make the counter of the \"o\" slightly taller than it is wide, for
    more of a hint that it's a letter and not just a geometric ring?\r\n\r\nAnd put
    a gray circle on the back of the shirt, as if it's the counter being punched through
    and showing up back there?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: It's funny, I only briefly considered other typefaces before I felt wedded
    to the Futura Bold for its perfect circle. Maybe I'll try one in a serif face.
