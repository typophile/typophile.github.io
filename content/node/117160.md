body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a question concerning the digitisation of handlettered typefaces.
  I have been experimenting translating some drawn letters and icons into fonts, which
  give me some problems. The way I usually work is like this:\r\n\r\n- scan as greyscale
  or bitmap\r\n- remove unwanted \"schmutz\" in Photoshop\r\n- trace in Illustrator
  to create a vector drawing (using the \"lettering\" preset), after which I usually
  simplify the result slightly (97-99%) to reduce the amount of nodes\r\n- import
  this trace into Glyphs Mini and try to clean it up\r\n\r\nThese last steps are quite
  tricky: I have been experimenting with tracing settings to see which gives a faithful
  result with the least amount of nodes. Hovever, most of the time it still creates
  way to many to create a proper digital font. Also the conversion from Illustrator
  to Glyphs is not 1=1, so this creates another problem. I have been trying to manually
  trace the typeface in Glyphs Mini, but it is difficult to archieve the roughness
  of the original.\r\n\r\nI am looking for some advise on how to improve this workflow,
  \ to create a font which has a handlettered feel but is well drawn so it won't create
  havoc for rasterizers and computers. By the way: what is the maximum amount of points
  a character can have before it becomes problematic? I have some fonts with a vintage
  letterpress effect which are quite slow to process...\r\n\r\ndisclaimer: I am no
  professional typedesigner, I am an illustrator with a big interest in type. I have
  no formal training in creating type, but have experimented quite a bit over the
  years, so I know a thing or two about the technical stuff."

  body: The easy way to do this is Scanfont from FontLab - Scan -cleanup (or not)
    -import -separate, size and save as Fontlab File. Or you can import grayscale
    glyph image as template into Fontographer or FontLab and trace.

  body: "I tried the Demo of scanfont, but it does not install on OSX Lion.\r\n\r\nI
    guess the tracing in Fontographer/Fontlab is the same as in Glyphs Mini, so that
    gives me the same problem I described above: how to maintain the handlettered
    feel without too many nodes. \r\n\r\nAlso, I hope I don't have to invest in another
    piece of software first. I am quite happy with drawing tool in Glyphs Mini, as
    they are very user-friendly (moreso than the ones in Illustrator IMO). I was quite
    interested in Scanfont as it seemed a good solution, especially if it saves me
    a lot of time. However it seems that it is a rather outdated piece of software
    which does not work on newer macs, which makes it useless to me. I believe Fontlab
    will not continue this product, but rather will roll it into a future version
    of Fontlab. Any better options for tracing would be appreciated, though....\r\n\r\nWhat
    about Type 3.2. I mean: it is not Pro software, but it is affordable to me (a
    non-pro) and has a tracing function which seems OK?"

    my students would take the worst glyph shape they could find, trace it with the
    most points possible and then see how small they could get it without loss of
    the feel. '

  body: "I find it efficient to use Scanfont on tif images, save the result as a vfb
    then open in Fontlab where I can see a shadow outline of the tif behind the nodes.
    For all but key nodes where a sharp connection is obviously needed -- crotches
    and corners --I convert everything to curves and smooth connections. If I'm having
    problems I reconvert the curves to lines and then back to curves with smooth connections
    at the non corner and non vertex segments. [I'm probably now as clear as mud.]
    \ I then delete as many of these nodes as possible by an incremental process until
    my vector outline is a fair approximation of the shadow. I find that the automated
    features of Fontlab to simplify are generally more trouble than doing it by hand.
    Add new sharp points as required. I then copy this outline to a clean glyph space
    and resize to my final font specs, e.g. caps height 700.\r\nI then begin the refining
    of the design. Straightforward for a sans or standard Roman, incredible amount
    of work for something like a scanned Morris design! The objective is always to
    produce a glyph with the minimum number of nodes that will be a good representation
    of the original design. Too many and the font will be a slow or unworkable kluge.
    Easier said than done, particularly when time is not unlimited.\r\nBTW the process
    works better by careful choice in the size of the tif image. Too large generates
    too many unnecessary points. Too small produces loss of accuracy in representing
    the outline. With practice its possible to find a relatively sweet spot.\r\nAs
    in all such comments, your mileage may vary.\r\nBTW I use an ancient version of
    Scanfont, but it still gets the job done.\r\nDon\r\n"

    buy typetool+scanfont as a reduced package, but I don't really want to invest
    in another fonteditor if it does not offer a significant plus in features. It
    seems better to work with illustrator and glyphs for the moment (even if Illustrator's
    handling of bezier curves really annoys me) and wait and see what the fontlab
    people come up with in the next few years with a promising, completely redesigned
    code-base. I have tried Transtype 4, and if this is anything to go by, it will
    be a massive improvement!"

    on the latest Macs is much faster than ScanFont running native on Snow Leopard.
    The only \"workaround\" is you have to save the results to a .vfb file rather
    than have the vfb open in FL. Not such a bad thing. That said, I keep a Mac laptop
    running Snow Leopard just so I can use the ScanFont in its original incarnation
    when I have more than one or two things to import.\r\n\r\nMany of the tracing
    settings available in ScanFont have been in Fontlab for years. The last item in
    the Preferences is \"Trace Options\" and you can auto trace a background using:
    Tools/Background/Trace."
