    & Ginger is pretty good. The many comparisons of different fonts in the same genre,
    all spelling "Handgloves", allow one to become familiar with the genres, and with
    the differences between the faces in each category, in a personal way: the initial
    similarities account for their grouping by the authors, but then it''s up to the
    viewer to "spot the difference" and refine his/her assessment of each face''s
    personality -- and memorize its name!'

  body: When I started out learning about type (back in the cave days) an Art Dirctor
    (ty Jimmy) sat with me every day as we discussed type. He implored me to start
    getting to know the relationship of the letters and memorize every darn R that
    was out there. He let me in on the secret of the letter Q - though in each typeface
    they are so unique -- but not used that often. The R on the otherhand is very
    common - and becomes easier to identify with age...

  body: "I too look at the R, at least that's what I look at to determine if a font
    is Helvetica or not.\r\n\r\nI've never been really great at remembering font names.
    I can remember seeing a font before and usually I spend the next couple hours
    scouring the net for what I think that font is. \r\n\r\nMyfonts and Identifont
    are two of my best resources, plus our ever expanding font library here at work.
    \r\n\r\nCourse, it's one thing to know a font; it's another to hunt it down. This,
    I think helps me learn more about the intricacies of all the great typefaces out
    there. Plus, following the IDs on this this board can be rewarding. Especially,
    when you think you recognize a font and then you realize you've never seen it
    before and you're introduced to a completely new family. "

  body: "Lowercase a and g are very distinctive glyphs, the way upper and lower case
    w is made also can be very distinctive. Number styles and uppercase A, R and M
    also help.\r\n\r\nA good start is trying to date the typeface, can it fit on the
    historic families? (humanist, garalde, modern, mechanical, etc...) does it looks
    like 20th century? postmodern perhaps?\r\n\r\nA good excercise is studying historic
    typefaces styles and then classifying fonts, this makes you look typefaces in
    detail and trains you to find those distinctive gestures.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"
