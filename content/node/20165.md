  body: "Freebie knock-offs do a huge disservice to the type designers who have spent
    many hours creating fonts and should receive compensation. Many of those designers
    are regulars at this forum but even if they aren't, they should be paid for their
    hard work.\r\n\r\nAlso you'll find that the freebies often don't match the quality
    of the licensed fonts they rip off.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/wiki/FAQ_free"
