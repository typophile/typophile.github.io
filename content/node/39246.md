  from website\" option in adobe acrobat. \r\n\r\nI tried saving it multiple times
  using various settings, but each time..the images and type did not stay in the webpage
  layout on the pdf. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?  The links don't need to work or go
  to any other levels. \r\nI could just simply take a screen shot and do all that
  stuff...but now this option has got me curious!\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help I would
  appreciate it! Thank you :) \r\n\r\n-Cat  "

  body: "when creating PDFs, you are really emulating the print drivers.\r\n\r\nWeb
    sites, when printed, aren't usually designed to look the same as they do on screen.
    This can be a good thing when done properly, afterall, screen and print are different
    mediums.\r\n\r\nBy default, you won't see background colors or background images
    when printing a web site (to PDF or otherwise). If the web developer/designer
    so chooses, they can even completely redesign the layout for printing and that
    happens automatically when you print/convert to PDF.\r\n\r\nIf what you want is
    a PDF of what it looks like EXACTLY on screen, then you need to do a screen shot.
    Note that you will no longer have a text-indexable PDF, though...if that is a
    concern."

  body: "Thank you for your input! I will have to look into it more, and it could
    be the format of the website. \r\n\r\nSatya: I'm not sure if it's the particular
    website I'm trying to convert, but I tried that link you suggested, but it only
    creates a text pdf of the website, and does not include any images or the format.
    \r\n\r\nThanks a bunch! :)  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
