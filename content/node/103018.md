body: "Hi There,\r\nI'm looking for an alternative to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-avant-garde-gothic/book/\">Avant
  Garde Gothic Book</a> to be used on an app. The license is $2000-4000 for the server/app
  usages which is too steep for us. I've tried whatthefont and a few other places
  but don't seem to be able to find anything close.\r\n\r\nCould anyone suggest some
  alternatives which are less expensive or free? \r\n\r\nThanks very much indeed!\r\n\r\nA"

    your bill. The application licenses are priced by units downloaded per months.
    *It is rather different from Avant Garde though.\r\n Much less harsh geometry.\r\n"

    Gyre Adventor</a> or its predecessor, URW++ Gothic L (included in <a href=\"http://downloads.ghostscript.com/public/fonts/\">this

    are many (IMHO much more attractive) geometric fonts available \u2014 personally
    I quite like Avenir, although what it costs to license for software I don't know
    \u2014 but naturally it depends on what you're trying to achieve with it..."

    model is too prohibitive for the project as we really have to include it for distribution

  body: "I know the sarcasm wasn\u2019t directed at me, but for the record: Monokrom
    are not offering cheap fonts that resemble other, more popular, fonts. Our goods
    are fairly priced original designs. We do have a system for application licensing
    that offers less friction for the customer than a lot of our competitors\u2019
    systems do. The license are also moderately* priced for small projects. This makes
    a lot of sense to us in a world where apps are sold for a dollar on iTunes.\r\n\r\n*
    Priced slightly lower than a single user desktop license."

    type designers, but I don't think Alex himself deserves a caustic reaction. We
    can't expect him to protect typeface design by turning down a good deal. I think
    all we can/should do is warn him to watch his back when using free fonts (while
    admitting that some of them are sometimes adequate, if rarely ideal).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    on downloads and although the app is branded, it's a free download so this is
    really a non starter sadly. Great work though"

    per month? How much would you think is reasonable to pay for using a font this
    way? I completely understand if our fonts are too expensive for you, I\u2019m
    just eager to understand. I\u2019d also love to know more about the project. Feel
    free to write me in person if you don\u2019t wish to disclose details in public."
