  body: "This is hand lettering, and that's that. Lots of movie titles and graphics
    were done throughout the 20th century with no reference to any existing typeface.
    In this case, there's no point trying to establish influences. However, if you
    want to try to mimic the style of this piece, definitely start with one of the
    aforementioned Tuscan typefaces. the lettering is much less regular, aligned,
    refined. \r\n\r\nCarl"
