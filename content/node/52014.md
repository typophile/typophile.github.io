  But I am still wondering if anyone had any suggestions of complimentary faces for
  this font. I have tried by best to talk to client out of using this font but for
  professional purposes I'd like to give them a secondary font as a option along with
  my choices. Any ideas? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/caramella_3898.jpg]"

    like [[http://www.linotype.com/41/americana-family.html?PHPSESSID=5849db2ccb7f52bbaccffca88e15b939&subviewmode=FONTS&samplestr=Caramella|Americana]],
    only thinner, and a bit more \"handmade\" looking.\r\n"

  body: Lantz- I'm looking for a serif pairing font. I just need one to recommend
    for use with this font to the client, but I'm trying to get them to go with another
    set completely.

    my experience, when you show a client various options (for typefaces, for layouts,
    for color palettes, anything), and you really, really dislike one of them, you're
    setting yourself up for disappointment. If you dislike that typeface enough to
    try your best to get them not to use the font, I suggest you simply do not offer
    an option that uses that typeface.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can come up with a second
    set that you do like. That way, you're giving them multiple options that you can
    (and are happy to) work with.\r\n\r\nAs for a complimentary font, I'm kind of
    stumped, but the sample you show reminds me a bit of Optima, and so I kind of
    want go the easy route and say \"pair it with Palatino.\" On the other hand, I
    think it would help if we knew what industry this was for.\r\n\r\n- \u2014 - \u2014
    - \u2014 - \u2014 - \u2014 - \u2014 - \u2014 -\r\nWill food for type."

  body: "Ok here's the deal. This is the typeface the client chose to use and they
    asked for my opinion, and I gave it. I told them the same thing that I have been
    hearing on here. And I am recommending other sets but they still want a pairing
    font for this one, for their peace of mind.  \r\n\r\nThanks for the advice though,
    I do appreciate you looking out for me. The use of this face would be for an ad
    campaign for tires aimed towards women. I am definitely trying to sway them towards
    two other sets I have recommended for use in this campaign, especially because
    it is a type heavy campaign."
