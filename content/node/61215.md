  sometime soon. As a graphic designer, this of course becomes a project. Our resum\xE9s
  are judged not only by what they say, but how they look as well.\r\n\r\nI'm trying
  to put together a package that includes an envelope, cover letter, resum\xE9, business
  card and miniature portfolio to send out. As of now, I'm using Neutraface for the
  type and one spot color and black for the layout. I'm trying to decide if that is
  enough branding for my purposes or if I should create a logo for myself as well.
  I've had professors tell me as an individual it is unnecessary and shows arrogance.
  On the other hand, it's one more opportunity to show my skills and adds personality.\r\n\r\nIt's
  a tough job market right now and not a lot of companies seem to be hiring so I want
  to put together the best package possible to send out. I'd love to hear other opinions
  on this both from people in my shoes and those of you who do the hiring. Also, if
  anyone has any tips on good job sites I'd be very grateful."
