  Alphabet, but though all my searching on the web I have found very little on him
  or the New Alphabet. All leads on books he&#39;s written, or been featured in, have
  run dry for me. Any information that doesn&#39;t turn up on google searches for
  &#34;Wim Crouwel&#34;, &#34;New Alphabet&#34;, or combinations of the two would
  be appreciated. '

    <BR>What kind of info do you want? If you want the <BR>faces themselves &#40;&#34;what
    the wall shows&#34;&#41; they&#39;re <BR>sold by TheFoundry as it was mentioned.
    <BR>Of course, the &#39;New Alphabet&#39; is a &#39;conceptual&#39; <BR>design
    - a proposition for a CRT face &#40;the main <BR>text of the booklet is set in
    Univers&#41;. That&#39;s <BR>1967 of course. Some theoretical aspects behind <BR>it
    are developed in an article Crouwel wrote in <BR>the Journal of Typographic Research
    &#40;=Visible <BR>Language&#41;, in its Winter 1970 issue: &#34;Type Design <BR>for
    the Computer Age&#34;. <BR> <BR>On Crouwel himself, the main reference is <BR>Frederike
    Huygen and Hugues Boekraad&#39;s <BR><I>Mode en Module</I>, a thick <I>catalogue
    raisonn&eacute;</I> <BR>&#40;Dutch-only unfortunately&#41;, nicely designed by

  body: 'Brian: no, I don&#39;t have that issue of the  <BR>JoTR but I had access
    to the article all  <BR>the same. It mentions the New Alphabet only  <BR>very
    briefly. The gist of it is that type <BR>in the computer age shouldn&#39;t be
    based on  <BR>the old, hand-derived forms. I quote this  <BR>sentence that might
    delight our friend <BR>Hrant: &#34;Writing by hand is fortunately a  <BR>vanishing
    skill.&#34; &#40;Exercise for HHP: compare <BR>Crouwel to Gerrit Noordzij&#41;.
    Instead, the  <BR>inner &#34;modular&#34; logic of the computer should <BR>inform
    the structure of &#34;letters&#34;. Crouwel <BR>calls that a cellular structure
    - which can <BR>be represented by &#34;dots&#34; &#40;I think the word <BR>&#34;pixel&#34;
    wasn&#39;t current yet in 1970&#41;. Only, <BR>the concept of a cell is richer
    and more <BR>complex than that of a pixel or dot. The  <BR>signs formed by these
    cells - &#34;enlarged  <BR>cellforms&#34; - he wouldn&#39;t call &#34;letters,
    but <BR>&#34;nuclei&#34;, the grouping of <I>nuclei</I> not &#34;words&#34;, <BR>but
    &#34;units&#34;. Together, <I>units</I> form a  <BR>&#34;communication&#34;. <BR>

    Crouwel&#41;, in their opposite ways, seem <BR>to be preoccupied with the formation
    of signs <BR>rather than their reading/decoding &#40;I think that&#39;s <BR>an
    over-simplistic assessment however&#41;. In any <BR>case, Crouwel&#39;s progressive
    approach &#40;and let&#39;s <BR>put it in context, that&#39;s 1967-70 - at least
    six <BR>years before R2D2&#41; seems healthy, especially <BR>when so much typography
