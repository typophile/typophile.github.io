  seems clear that it needs to be (relatively) bigger in text than display, but by
  how much? Or is there no way besides experiment?"

  body: Well, for starters I suggest looking at existing typefaces, both text and
    display, to see  what other designers have done. That'll give you something to
    start on... Then you can experiment based on that.

    punctuation is circular, seeing as circles read smaller than squares of the same
    width, I'd say your eriod should be 20-30% wider than the thickness of your thickest
    stem, up to a a certain point. Derive the rest from there.\r\n\r\nNaturally I
    defer to the opinion of those with more knowledge and experience than I, should
    they choose to speak up about it."

  body: "Apostrophes generally tend to fill the vertical space of an ascender, so,
    once you have the period, if you raise it up, and then add the curl down to the
    x-heigh, it will look about right.  To make a comma, take the apostrophe  you
    made, and then drop it down, and its curve will tend to be about right, unless
    you have a super-low x-height with a miniscular descender. For that and the periods,
    here's a sample I put together.  Just look at other fonts in a similar way for
    the other marks.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.elahorcado.net/random/punctuation_comparison.pdf\r\n\r\nEdit:
    ack, apparently OmniGroup does use a separate engine for generating PDFsfrom their
    Export command than the standard PDF creation in OS X.  Anyways, some of those
    are a little off alignment from where I put them but you get the general idea.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "<em> \"Are there any guidelines about designing punctuation?\" </em>\r\n\r\nYes
    there are. \r\n\r\nI learned and continue to suggest one start with the i's dot
    and make a period that is apparently the same size as the i's dot in the middle
    of the point size range for which the font is intended to be used. (One can also
    start with the j's dot if one doesn't trust ones own i's. :))\r\n\r\nThe period's
    size may be made larger for smaller uses, and smaller for larger uses. The rest
    is based on that period with comma being made to look the same size despite its
    tail, the colon slightly smaller in its twinning and etc. But the period usually
    remains the largest.\r\n\r\nIf there is no lowercase, then base the period on
    the stem of the H and if the l.c. dots are somehow stylistically deviant, make
    one that isn't deviant just for this purpose and toss it when done. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>is there no way besides experiment?</em>\r\n\r\nI generally try to avoid
    following guidelines, and \"work out\" what looks best for a particular face by
    trying variants and see how they perform in different settings, before looking
    around to see how other designers have handled things.\r\n\r\nAs David demonstrates,
    guidelines can provide procedures that are useful for experiments, and using the
    i-dot as a benchmark is a good idea, because it connects a number of thematic
    elements; in size, it relates to the period, and in position to quote marks and
    accents.\r\n\r\nAgain, as he explains, the size of the various dots in a type
    varies. Consider, for instance, the dots in the question mark and bang; don't
    assume that these dots should be uniform with the dots in period, i, dieresis,
    etc. \r\n"

  body: "Punctuation marks being \"road signs\" aiding interpretation of the text,
    they need to be legible and distinct without being distracting. In some typefaces
    the tail of the comma is so thin and/or short that at small point sizes, it's
    hard to tell it from a period. A version of Times that somebody used to print
    out a manuscript for me a while back had periods so small that I was always confusing
    them with specks in the paper stock. The two elements of the double quote marks
    are sometimes placed too close, again causing legibility problems at small sizes.\r\n\r\nExperimenting
    is the only way, paying particular attention to the smaller end of the point-size
    range a particular design would normally be used at. The human eyeball is often
    the best measurement tool."
