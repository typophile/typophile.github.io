  body: "[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sassoon-sans/|Sassoon Sans]] has
    a vertical f like that, but there is more contrast in your letter suggesting a
    serif font. It's possible the italic was backslanted. It might also be a Math
    function (\u0192) symbol [Option-f on a Mac]. Most font showings don't show this
    glyph, so it would be hard to browse for this one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    'Garalde' as the search term. There were a few that were vertical, or nearly so,
    but most had different details. I thought [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/dante/|Dante]]
    was pretty close. You might find something even closer if you looked at more than
    the 225 families this search pulled up.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks, Mike. I hadn't considered that it could be the function symbol; thanks
    for that and I'm sure I can find a suitable substitute, or at least one I can
    slant back to match closely enough.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it does seem that the vertical
    ital f is extremely rare in serif families.\r\n\r\nThank you again."

    look at the unicode chart http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0180.pdf we see this\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unchart_5182.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo,
    it seems, you are not the only one to assume that, yet I am unaware of a character
    called \"function symbol\" in mathematics. In  France, there is a tradition where
    capital letters and  Greek letters used in mathematical formulae are upright (and
    that is why the psi in my avatar is upright) but I am unaware of a mathematical
    tradition that would denote functions with small upright italic letters. If I
    use the LaTeX fourier package with the upright option to denote a function <em>f</em>
    from X to Y, I get this\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/function_6158.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    X and Y are upright (contrary to the American tradition) but the f is not.\r\n\r\n[Edit]
    However, I have seen comments on another thread where it is contended that the
    florin should be slanted... "

  body: "Michel, I think it is usual for that symbol to be slanted, but apparently
    some typefaces use much less slant than others. When I was  an engineering student
    it didn't matter, since it only needed to look like a lower case f with a tail
    (we were writing it all by hand in the 60's). It's not clear how the posted glyph
    was being used. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, there are two independent questions here, the hook and the slant. Concerning
    the use, here is something interesting I found in Victor Gaultney's (pdf) text
    <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/render_download.php?site_id=nrsi&format=file&media_id=Gentium_RU_spec&filename=Gentium_RU_spec.pdf\"><em>gentium,
    a typeface for the nations</em></a>, and I cite: \r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The design
    of the italic f [in Gentium] allows a clear distinction to be made between it
    and the hooked version. Both are used for the Ewe language of Ghana.</em>\r\n\r\nand
    he gives the example:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ufaital_5165.jpg]\r\nI
    gather that in the regular, that should read\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ufareg_6116.jpg]\r\nand
    that U+0192 should normally be upright in the regular and, in the italic, it should
    share it's slant.\r\n\r\nAs for the requirement of a hooked f in mathematical
    formulas, I am suprised at what you say but engineers may have conventions that
    mathematicians don't. Normally mathematics lowercase is italics and, in most fonts
    but not all, the italic f is hooked. So I looked at my math books to see if any
    would use a non hooked italic f to represent a function; I found a few nicely
    edited books from the Springer series \"Ergebnisse der mathematik\" (one of which
    is even printed in the USA) with f(x) written as in (1), which is less hooked
    than the non hooked gentium italic f. I found essentially the same f in two books
    published in France (2); I also found a little book from Mir publishers, Moscow,
    with an italic f(x) that is absolutely not hooked (3). Those books date from the
    sixties and seventies and are all \"graduate level\" pure mathematics.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fofx_5671.jpg]\r\nIf
    you have any reference about that hook requirement, please let me know.\r\n\r\nMichel

  body: "Michel, you have done much more research on this than I have. I was an engineering
    student in 1962-67, when anything we did was done by hand. We didn't even have
    calculators, not to mention laptops. As long as what we wrote seemed to resemble
    the function symbol, that was good enough. Our textbooks were probably printed
    with metal type, and I can't honestly say that I paid too much attention in those
    days to what the function symbol f was like. At that point it would still be about
    20 years until I started caring about fonts, or noticing details like that. \r\n\r\nI
    tend to think that the 'requirements' about this are just general conventions,
    and as long as the function symbol is distinct from the other lettering in the
    textbooks, no one would be confused. I have been told that mathematicians can
    be very particular about their symbols, but as long as I am not typesetting one
    of their books, I don't think I will worry about it much.\r\n\r\nWe still don't
    even know what the 'f' of this post was supposed to be -- a vertical italic f,
    or a Florin symbol, or a function symbol -- but it seems we have answered the
    question well enough. \r\n\r\nI am impressed by your thoroughness though, and
    I have noticed that about you before. Well done.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
