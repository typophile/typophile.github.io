  body: Funny because I really thought it was no font and while starting the search
    trying to complete excellent list compiled by Don, I've encountered with the match.
    And you know what? It's free and called '[[http://www.dafont.com/eastwood.font|Eastwood]]'.
    Lucky day :)

  body: "Good find Ryuk.\r\nEastwood seems to have been derived from the 1960s poster
    for _A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS_ http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t84/theclinteastwoodarchive/HiQualityUKQuad.png\r\nThe
    ARSENIC AND OLD LACE image seems to be relatively recent and clearly uses Eastwood.\r\nA
    reminder that when looking at an image for font ID its really helpful to know
    the approximate date.\r\nDon"
