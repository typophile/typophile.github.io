  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I don't have the time right now to TrueType hint my typeface, so I was thinking of a hinting service that can do this for me. I have found a few companies that offer TT hinting, but I have no idea what the normal fee for such a job is. So that's why I'd like to know which companies do you recommend and what do they normaly charge for let's say: a sans serif typeface that need TT hints from 9-24 points?

I also like to know if they want the right to sell your font as it was their own after they did the hinting for me, cause I want to keep the right to whom I sell the font to.

Thanks in advance!</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I expect price also depends partly on what level of hinting you want, and whether for ClearType, GDI greyscale, or both. Character set (number of glyphs) is also a factor.

It sounds like you're talking about delta hints specifically when you mention 9-24 points. BTW, "points" are not the relevant unit as they are relative: pixels per em is the unit in question. 9 pt on Windows = 12 pt on Mac = 12 ppem.

Paying somebody to do hinting for you is quite separate from them getting rights to sell your font(s). However, you might get a discount or even free hinting in exchange for non-exclusive resale rights or something....

Cheers,

		<div class="commentbody">A quote i received  18 months ago for delta hinting an original typeface design which included Latin (western and Central Europe, no vietnamese), Cyrillic and Greek, so the type would function well in small sizes on screen was in the $6000-$8000 range. You've got to figure $100-$250 per hour for this sort of font engineering. Hobbyists beware!</div>

So Terminaldesign does TT hinting and delta hinting? How much would you estimate TT hint (plus delta hinting) a simple geometric sans serif typeface with 256 glyphs? Just a range, it don't have to be precise.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I do not generally do this work, the quote I received was from one of my colleagues. You can inquire at Monotype, and Ascender, they are two developers who do this sort of thing. There are many independent designers who do this as well, but I don't think many take on much outside work due to the fact that few want to pay for the service. The free Microsoft web fonts did a great deal of harm when it comes to pricing this sort of work.

To put it another way; TT hinting makes type design appear to be the most non-tedious work on the planet!</div>

But considering the costs, this is not something I can do for every typeface.
Monotype and Ascender must do a good job I guess. Dalton Maag looks interesting too. 
If anyone else knows of companies who offer this service please post!

FontWerk is experienced in TT hinting for more than 8 years.
 
I recommend to look not only on the price for TT hinting.
 
(1) Look as well at the data formats you get after TT hinting.
All the hinting stuff made by FontWerk is based on FontLab. You get not only a hinted ttf file, but also the FontLab-internal vfb-file for further work (additional characters in the future).
 
(2) Look as well at the hinting level you really need.
Good hinting options in the font file may produce sufficient screen quality by autohinting a Sans Serif typeface.
A good screen quality you may get with a manually basic TT hinting with no deltas. So the price for basic hinting does not depend on the point sizes but on the number of glyphs in the font.
Only if you need excellent screen quality delta hints are necessary. Delta hinting takes a lot of time because it is manually work on each glyph in each point size.
So, depending on the quality level it takes me between 2 hours and 2 weeks working time to optimize screen quality for TTFs with full Latin character set.
(3) Look at price-performance ratio.
 
If you send sample font to Monibart@fontwerk.de you will get a detailed TT hinting offer asap. Please be sure, that after finishing the hinting job all your font related data will be deleted from all FontWerk disks.

DH, do you work at or own Fontwerk? I looked at the site http://www.fontwerk.de but I get allot of "content/image not available"(red x) on the site. Will the site be available in english?
