body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nWondered if anyone could help ID this logo. The closest I could
  get was Presicav by Ray Larabie, but there seem to be some slight differences. \r\n\r\nIt
  is very possible it was hand drawn, as a few letterforms seem a bit odd. Even tried
  to unrightfully manipulate a few common faces into it with no luck. Thought I would
  consult the experts before making files for our comps.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.
  I love Typophile!\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/halstonLogo_Web_3860.jpg]"

    Gothic.\r\nZeppelin 41 has a similar feeling but is not as light and has a different
    S.\r\n\r\n [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atgothic-extended/|AT Gothic Extended]]
    is also very similar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions. \r\n\r\nI had looked at Zeppelin
    and Titling, and in my opinion they are both far superior to the sample. Unfortunately
    it looks like we are going to have to pander to the photo copy of the letterhead
    for now and redraw an S that is inferior to the forms in those faces. \r\n\r\nSometimes
    it is funny how people want to spend their money.\r\n\r\nMuch obliged for the
    time and knowledge.\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n\r\n"
