  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello, I am currently trying to create a logo for a construction company, but the name is so vague that I cannot think of any mark that is suitable. I have done all the conceptual work - mind mapping, sketching, word association, image searching, etc - but still cannot think of anything suitable.</p>
<p>I think it may be partially because I am creating the logo for my father&rsquo;s business (note: I am a design student currently completing my Des BA) and thus I am too close to it, so now I ask you all for help with coming up with a suitable idea. It has been quite a challenge for me (frustratingly so as usually these things are not so difficult for me) so I hope you all can provide some insight be it a word, an image, a concept, a typeface, whatever you can provide.</p>
<p>I really appreciate any help anyone could provide.</p>
<p>The company name is: Ceilings and More (note: the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; is spelled, not &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;, and he is very adamant about that).</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone, I hope to be posting later with some critique of some kind of logo!</p>
<hr>
<p>APPENDED: attached is a digital sketch of one of my concepts. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to rip it and be as honest as possible too, I am not attached to it: it is just some of my work, it&rsquo;s not me!</p>

Did a large ampersand once fall on him during a construction project?</p>

sit on a baseline have them &ldquo;hang&rdquo; from the cap height.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Do you need to use all uppercase on the &ldquo;and more&rdquo;&hellip; maybe it&rsquo;s my time spent on the net, but uppercase tends to SCREAM too much for my taste &ndash; especially when it&rsquo;s only used on &ldquo;half&rdquo; a logo.</p>
<p>Overall, I wonder if the face (this is Galliard, yes?) is a little too &ldquo;middle-of-the-road&rdquo;&hellip; it has some nice curves, but it&rsquo;s also kind of angular. The squared-off dot in the &ldquo;i&quot;s would stand out more in a more organic, curved face. Maybe even Galliard Italic? On the other hand, a more modern/geometric/tech face would likely convey the &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; quality of the company (if, indeed, it is more of a B-to-B rather than consumer enterprise).</p>
<p>The overall letter spacing seems a bit open too, though I tend to subscribe to the &ldquo;tight but not touching&rdquo; school when it comes to logos and headlines.</p>
<p>I kinda like the mark/dingbat, but it <em>is</em> pretty generic. Maybe the ornate panel would work better <em>inside</em> the box rather than outside, as you are selling ceilings, not exterior walls.</p>
<p>I just keep thinking about how you could convey &ldquo;above-ness&rdquo; or &ldquo;overhead-ness&rdquo; in a design. Try to think of how others do it, like Travellers insurance (they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;got you covered&rdquo; with an unbrella), or maybe look at roofing company logos. Don&rsquo;t steal, just get inspired. I keep (mentally) coming back to the ceiling of the Sistine chapel for some reason&hellip; the &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; ceiling i suppose.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My first impression of the logo was that it&rsquo;d be for an office supply company.</p>
<p>It seems unfitting to use a serif font for a construction company. Construction is mainly about robustness, not delicateness. Plus, the delicate aspect is already sufficiently represented by the ornamental symbol on the left. Therefore, a sans serif font should be more suitable here &ndash; a tall and narrow one, if you want the text to have some elegancy and less massiveness.</p>
<p>Also, the two colors used are both a bit pale, which does not only enforces the &ldquo;more delicate than robust&rdquo; impression, but also could be problematic if the logo is used in single color situations. Have you thought about how a greyscale version is supposed to look like?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Collin, here&rsquo;s my wandering thoughts on the subject&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crap name and one of those banal and cheesey business naming conventions of the 1980&rsquo;s like World of Chairs, Worktops &lsquo;r&rsquo; Us, Ovens Etc, Supadoors.</p>
<p>But it does have a quality you could play with. Think of it as two surnames and it sounds a bit like a business partnership from the 1800&rsquo;s possibly founded by Dr Samuel Ceilings and the Reverand Quentin More to promote, as they might have put it &ldquo;the edification of interior heavens&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Combine that with your father being &ldquo;very old fashioned/traditional&rdquo; and that he&rsquo;s probably been in the business for a good number of years now and you have a possible solution&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;design it in the style of shop and truck signage from, say the 1880&rsquo;s to 1900, or any classic period.</p>
<p>Make it a period study or revisionist exercise or parody or whatever by looking at font&rsquo;s and ornate embelishments / flourishes / devices from a particular era.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just one reference I found quickly&hellip; <a href="http://www.signmuseum.com/">http://www.signmuseum.com/</a></p>
<p>Maybe have the name in all capitals with a ceiling rose style graphic* between them for symmetry&hellip;</p>
<p>CEILINGS * AND MORE</p>
<p>You could go with deep bold colours with strong contrast or blended natural tones and textures. Maybe even incorporate a &ldquo;SINCE 1978&rdquo; style phrase.</p>
<p>BTW Does Ceilings need to be plural? Flooring tends not to be pluralised. Too late to change it I guess?</p>

<p>Jon, I laughed at that &ldquo;More&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ceilings&rdquo; comment, but you know, it actually makes sense. And I think taking a more reverential approach may work well.</p>

<p>Any chance you can talk him into using &lsquo;Ceilings and more&rsquo; as the tagline and go with a more logical company name? Even if it&rsquo;s something as generic as &lsquo;Smith Fine Woodworking&rsquo; or the like.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Stylize a sophisticated/clean length of crown molding - and set the word &lsquo;Ceilings&rsquo; upon it. Allow the &lsquo;g&rsquo; to descender below the top line of the crown molding.</p>
<p>Underneath the length of crown molding set an ampersand and the word &lsquo;more&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The ampersand will associate with the &lsquo;g&rsquo; descender', thus giving the composition a wholeness, a completivity (new word!), unity.</p>
