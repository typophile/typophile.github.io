    So your cutomers still on older systems can still use them without all the fancy
    features though. While the OT CFF PS ones might not. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    explain a bit more about their project we might be able to suggest some pros/cons
    for each flavor, otherwise we're just comparing cakes to pies ;-)\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "Below is a short analysis that I prepared for Leslie Cabarga's \"Learn FontLab
    Fast\" book* \r\n\r\nPC TrueType / OpenType TT\r\n(Also known as: Data-fork TrueType,
    Windows TrueType, TrueType-flavored OpenType, TTF)\r\n\r\nPros: Works on Windows,
    Linux and Mac OS X. May contain up to 65,535 characters, supports Unicode and
    can contain OpenType layout features, making the format suitable for multilingual
    fonts, non-latin fonts and advanced typographic features (such as automatic ligatures,
    small caps). TrueType hinting allows precise control in small screen sizes, can
    also contain bitmaps. Can include embedding rights information defining whether
    or not the font may be attached to electronic documents.\r\n\r\nCons: Does not
    work on Mac OS 8/9; not completely cross-platform. May cause output problems on
    ten-year-old PostScript output and printing devices. The designer usually needs
    to convert the outlines from beziers which may introduce slight changes in the
    shape. When converted back to beziers (e.g. in Illustrator), the resulting curves
    have superfluous points. Manual TrueType hinting is laborious to create. The multilingual
    and advanced typography features only work with new OpenType-savvy applications,
    otherwise just the basic character set is available. For font families, requires
    two versions of the family name within each font: the first may contain any number
    of styles; the second \u201Cmini-family\u201D may contain only four styles.\r\n\r\nOpenType
    PS\r\n(Also known as: OpenType-CFF, PostScript-flavored OpenType, OTF)\r\n\r\nPros:
    Works on Windows, Linux, Mac OS 8.6, 9, and OS X. Uses the bezier curve system
    preferred by designers and used in drawing apps such as Illustrator and Freehand
    so letterforms can be drawn precisely and outlines need not be converted. May
    contain up to 65,535 characters, supports Unicode and can contain OpenType layout
    features, making the format suitable for multilingual fonts, non-Latin fonts and
    advanced typography (automatic ligatures, small caps). Type 1 hinting is comparatively
    easy to create. Can include embedding rights information.\r\n\r\nCons: Type 1
    hinting does not allow precise control in small screen sizes. Can theoretically
    contain bitmaps, but they are not displayed. Since this is a relatively new format,
    there are problems with some applications (some styles are not displayed in menus,
    kerning for non-Western characters does not work.) The multilingual and advanced
    typography features only work with new OpenType-savvy applications, otherwise
    just the basic character set is available. Two alternative family namings within
    each font must be devised: one where a family contains an arbitrary number of
    styles, and second where one family does not contain more than four styles. Does
    not work on Mac OS 8.\r\n\r\n*) Get the book while you still can: \r\nhttp://www.logofontandlettering.com/\r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "Well, as a matter of fact, that tedious font naming issue is not the problem
    of any font platform or font creator program.\r\nIt is in fact because when Microsoft
    engineers, back yonder, built their marvellous DOS and Windows Operating Systems,
    they, in their infinite wisdom, figured that a single font family seems to have
    Plain, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic variants. That is the maximum of four variants.
    And that is STILL the reason for two different family naming.\r\nOr am I totally
    of the mark here?"

  body: 'You are not totally off the mark, but to be fair to those MS engineers, their
    observation was pretty accurate: they didn''t define a standard type family, they
    just looked at what was out there and what other people were already doing. And
    what people were doing was inherited from practices determined by earlier digital
    type and by phototype, e.g. the number of fonts that could be included on a disk
    for phototype.'
