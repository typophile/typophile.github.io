  body: I would ordinarily set the baseline grid to the leading of the body text and
    not worry about whether headings fall on the grid.

  body: "The smaller your baseline grid is, the more (vertical) freedom you have.
    However, with such an extremely fine spaced grid you might as well not use one
    at all!\r\n\r\nI usually use a whole-leading grid; sometimes whole fractions,
    such as 1/2 or 1/3 of the body text leading.\r\n\r\nIt Depends -- mainly on how
    large your headings, and its associated white space above and below, are when
    compared to body text and leading.\r\n\r\n(Your Headings leading seems to assert
    you only have one-line headings. I'd suggest using more tighter leading, and fill
    up the remaining space with Space Above and Space Below.)"

    type to help obscure see-through with thin paper, but I've never heard of a baseline
    grid being used for that purpose. I think a baseline grid is mainly used so that
    baselines in adjacent columns will align."

    think that's also the only way to make the system work mathematically. (am I correct?)\r\n\r\nIf
    this baseline grid is good, what would be the appropriate sizes for my headings?

  body: "Tim, what Bert was saying was that in InDesign you should use \"space before\"
    (or \"space after\") to control spacing between paragraphs. Or in this case, spacing
    between a headline (which is a very small paragraph) and the text. \r\n\r\nYou
    can set \"space before/after\" settings in the paragraph palette or by creating
    a style sheet with those settings.\r\n\r\nSetting the H2 heads the way you did
    at 24/64 will produce weird results if a headline takes 2 or more lines, and in
    general it's bad technique. Never use leading or blank lines to add spacing between
    paragraphs, it's better to use \"space before\" or \"space after\"."

  body: "<blockquote>How can that work? The points match exactly with my baseline,
    mm don't.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYou are not limited to entering everything in mm,
    even if your default measurements are set to that. Enter \"16pt\" or \"32pt\"
    -- InDesign will automatically re-calculate it into your current measurement unit.
    (Correct me if I'm wrong, but from your images I infer you <em>are</em> using
    InDesign.)\r\n\r\nIs your plain text 12 pt high? Try building \"up\" from that,
    in steps of 2 pts: 3rd headline 14 pt, 2nd headline 16 pt, and (not shown) 1st
    headline 18 pt. You can also increase the steps towards larger headlines; something
    like 14, 16, 20 pts.\r\n\r\nSince your 3rd headlines are in another color and
    another weight, you can also try the same size as your body text \u2013 the hierarchical
    difference is already there."

  body: I see it's an old discussion but I just want to add my method. I usually set
    the baseline grid to half the pt size of the leading. This will keep things consistent
    without having too much space between paragraphs.
