  just know this is gonna be so easy that I'll feel stupid, but I cannot for the life
  of me remember this typeface. It's possible this is a hand-lettered version, because
  I seem to remember it being just a touch wider, but it's definitely based on an
  existing face."

    by Warren Chappell (1938-39).  I think you've got it Mike -- it just seems like
    a condensed version, which could have been done optically with film type, if it
    was in use when this was printed. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I just looked Lydian up in McGrew's book of 'American Metal Typefaces' and
    there was a condensed version, created in 1946 by Chappell, but not marketed until
    1949. However, it doesn't match the sample very well. There were other similar
    metal types, like Valiant (Monotype 1940), Czarin (Baltimore Type 1948) and Samson
    (Ludlow 1940) which were similar pen lettering designs, but not as close as Lydian
    to the posted sample. There is also mention of a typeface by Koch called 'Offenbach'
    from 1935, as being the model for Czarin (which is actually very similar to Lydian).\r\n\r\nProbably
    too much information, but I'm hard to stop once I get rolling ;^)\r\n\r\n - Mike

  body: Thanks, Mike. Here is a bit of Koch's <a href="http://moorstation.org/Koch_Memorial/type/offenbach.htm"
    target="_blank">Offenbach</a>. His <a href="http://moorstation.org/Koch_Memorial/type/stahl.htm"
    target="_blank">Stahl</a> seems to have been in the same vein, too.

  body: "Thanks Mike. Seeing that sample of Offenbach puzzles me, because Stahl looks
    much closer to 'Czarin' shown in McGrew's book. However, I'd be surprised if 'CybaPee'
    got the Koch information wrong.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
