  <BR> <BR>The font for &#34;SHAMIR SHAH DESIGN&#34; looks a little like Gill Sans...
  but that&#39;s not it. <BR> <BR>Ideas?'

  body: That&#39;s Gill Sans as far as I can tell. It&#39;s a teensy bit distorted  <BR>by
    the pixelisation, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s the real deal. <BR> <BR>The
    rest is reeeally tiny Arial.

  body: Why don&#39;t you think it&#39;s Gill Sans? <BR> <BR>My guess would be Gill
    Sans and Arial.

  body: I typed it out in Gill Sans, and the width of the characters is off... this
    is more square than Gill. Specifically the M and the H. Perhaps it&#39;s an extended
    version? Hm...

  body: I think it&#39;s letterspacing, not the shapes of the letters. Here&#39;s
    a sample of Gill Sans Light at 28pt with tracking at &#43;170. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/62980.gif"
    alt="Shamir Shah Design"> <BR> <BR>The weight is slightly different, but this
    might be because of anti-aliasing or image processing. The shapes look the same
    to my eye though.
