  body: Hmm... possible, as it looks like a council-sponsored sign. Still, I think
    it'd not be FF DIN then but a generic [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451|DIN1451]].
    Of course, one would need a caliper or a micrometer to tell the difference.

    rel="dofollow">illuminated letters</a> that designers must taken into consideration.
    It's viewable in the public and effective for business advertising.
