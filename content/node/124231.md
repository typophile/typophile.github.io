  body: "Renko's guess is appropriate because your image is small and lacks distinctive
    letters, with the exception of _a_.\r\nCompare:\r\nArial Medium [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArialMediumlAs_performance_4817.jpg]\r\nwhich
    looks pretty much the same as \r\nNeue Haas Grotesk Medium [img:sites/default/files/old-images/NeueHaasGroteskMedlAs_performance_5228.jpg]\r\nbut
    not identical to Helvetica Neue 65 Medium [img:sites/default/files/old-images/HelveticaNeue65MediumAs_performance_6296.jpg]\r\nor
    Helvetica Bold -- which is not available in Medium [img:sites/default/files/old-images/HelveticaBoldlAs_performance_5585.jpg]\r\nor
    to similar Swiss style Grotesque's such as Folio Medium [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FolioMediumAs_performance_6642.jpg]\r\nDon"
