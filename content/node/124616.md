body: "Hello\r\nI just finished designing a script font and there is an alternative
  \"s\" for the ending of the words called \"sfinal\" that works perfectly. But now
  my client wants to add a beginning \"s\", for the beginning of words, I have called
  it \"s.init\" and I cant make it work. It is only this letter of its kind, no other
  letter will I use at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe attached image show what I have written
  on Classes window and what I have written in the OpenType window. To avoid confussion,
  I erased everything I have written for this new beggining \"s\". I am sure it is
  very simple but I can't seem to be good at programming, it goes beyong me.\r\n\r\nHow
  should I write on the \"Classes\" and \"OpenType\" windows? Any help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n"

    you read from the beggining but if you're in some kind of hurry he talks about
    the init feature in this page: http://opentypecookbook.com/common-techniques.html\r\n\r\ngood
    luck!"

    be more helpfull if I could get the coding for each case: Classes window and OpenType
    window.\r\nI will try to review it to see it can make some sense.\r\nRegards"

  body: "OK, I followed alvaroefe adviseand and reviewed the mentioned link. AND I
    MADE SOME PROGRESS. I renamed my glyphs and revised what I have written.\r\nIn
    FontLab, IT WORKS, nevertheless in InDesign works but only if I set up automatic
    in the OpenType window but in Illustrator nothing works. How can I make it work
    just by typing and that's it???\r\nI have attached an image of how I have it set
    up. On the top the Classes and on the bottom the OpenType windows of both INIT
    and FINA letters\r\nPlease HELP!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/progress_6497.jpg]"

    work.

    Cookbook site mentioned above can clarify that.
