body: "Hello\r\nA few years ago I remember reading about (and possibly even purchasing)
  a font that mimics lettering in 18th-19th Century ironwork fencing/gates, like you
  would see on the gates to a public park, a large estate, castle, etc. (The images
  I'm uploading are the general idea)\r\nThe font included not just the letterforms,
  but a way to create the horizontal/vertical iron bands and scrollwork that \"held\"
  the letters, also.\r\nI think it was called something like Covent Garden or Chelsea
  Garden, but I've done a search and can't find anything like that. Does this sound
  familiar to anyone? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/royal3bg_3878.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/w-ironwork_5211.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/nameplate_4551.jpg]"
