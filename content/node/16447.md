  body: "I think you could try using only the Rotis family for your book, it has something
    to do with Math too. The text which is now inside the \u2018I\u2019 in the cover
    looks like in a \u201Crefugee\u201D place, you can consider a tiny line of text
    under the square compostion; regarding this, as I can see you did for the \u2018C\u2019,
    the same thing needs to be applied on \u201CB, S\u2019 because of their round
    shapes, so it is enough you move the \u2018E\u2019 to the left a little bit. I
    like the cube apostrophe. The opening page also needs work, maybe you want \u201CBy
    Mary Bellis\u201D to be on the right, for sure your book should start on page
    3, the one you or the software called page 4 on your spread.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"

  body: "I was thinking of applying this book to the product and packaging. \r\nI
    would redesign the existing packaging and, this booklet (alot smaller, maybe alittle
    larger then the actual cube) would be like an insert. I would have to edit the
    text alittle and maybe include some world records that i found online. Maybe even
    have a page where the customer would enter the time that they attempted to solve
    the cube.\r\n\r\nThis would give a purpose for the book. \r\n\r\nThanks alot for
    all your comments."

    book toward those publications called \"Activity Book\", so it is a good design
    idea. You can also check my handout on \"Games & Learning\" :\r\nhttp://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~segalini/Games_and_Learning.pdf\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"

  body: "love this project of yours. I would love to see those combinations that just
    get under your skin.like when everything's matched up except for one peice.. also
    kinda cool to see it in mid-turn. can the typography find a way to be 3dimensional,
    a little enigmatic? peeled? (homage the cheaters). maybe throw in overtly 'geeky'
    typefaces.\r\n\r\nwaay cool. cheers!"
