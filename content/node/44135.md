    on the term \"calligraphy\" should produce candidates that would be similar, o
    you can look at fonts by Baker, Zapf, Crossgrove, or Bouwsma for other ideas.\r\n\r\n-

    like probably designed by Will Carter in 1964. Rich Lipton has done a number of
    bookjackets like this and his Italic a's are somewhat similar, but not as wide
    and generally more contemporary.\r\n\r\nStephen Rapp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the opinions, all, and Stephen, I'll be sure to look out for cover
    work by Carter and Lipton. I really like this particular hand and have pretty
    well covered the waterfront looking for a close match in a typeface. I have a
    lot of books whose cover lettering is lost in the mists of time. Here's one from
    the Thirties:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/weekendbksm_6382.jpg]"

  body: Thanks for suggestions, Stephen. The Scrivano is not too unlike in the lower
    case but less so for relative height of capitals. There are quite a few fonts
    with some similarities.
