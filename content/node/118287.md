  body: "The date is helpful. During the 16th century there was considerable variety
    in blackletter typefaces, as printers attempted to mimic hand lettering. The letterforms
    suggest an early form of fraktur/textura.\r\nI don't know of a digital version
    of this precise font.\r\nThere a few digital blackletter fonts based on typefaces
    from the era that have some of the flavor of your 1578 specimen.\r\nDracena by

  body: "Good find Dick. JSL Blackletter  definitely looks similar to most of the
    body text and could be a version of the typefqace.\r\nNote that the printer seems
    to have mixed type depending on what was at hand. For example I found several
    versions of blackletter _T_. Also the printer used some peculiar capitalization
    practices. For example: WOrshipful, and THis\r\nThe sample is taken from _The
    pleasant historie of the conquest of the Weast India, now called New Spayne, atchieued
    by the vvorthy prince Hernando Cortes by Francisco L\xF3pez de G\xF3mara (1578)_\r\nFor
    anyone wishing to examine a higher resolution of the typeface, the full text of
    the book is available at Archive.org https://archive.org/details/pleasanthistorie01lpez
