body: "Little is known about Bob Colby except that he organized [[SOTA]]\u2019s first
  physical gathering, [[TypeCon]]98, which took place in Westborough, Massachussetts,
  a suburb of Boston. The next event TypeCon, held again in Westborough in 2000, was
  met with continued enthusiasm. Colby elected to step down from his role as conference
  organizer, and turned over the reins to other modivated typophiles to carry the
  organization and conference on to the next level."
