    but we had this before.. :)\r\n\r\n<em>Edit-A-Bit.: This should be '<a href=\"http://www.houseindustries.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18&subpage=viewfonts\"

    Javier. We all had our share of first-post-nervousness once. Welcome to Typophile,
    I hope you enjoy your stay. I'll take care of your mislaced thread and move it
    to the Type ID Board. :^)"
