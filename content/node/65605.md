  Poppins accents, Scrooge flying to the moon, Carrey giving a party-bore Alastair
  Sim impression). What surprised me, amid an hour and a half of obsessively realised
  detail, was that the lettering engraved on Scrooge\u2019s gravestone appeared to
  be \u2018set\u2019 in Goudy. That face is used in the publicity material, so they
  may have been using up something they had lying around already, but could there
  be an alternative interpretation? Does Scrooge, b. 1786, in fact understand that
  the Spirit of Typefaces Yet to Come is showing him that he will not die before 1915
  at least, and more likely not until the other end of the 20th century when gravestone
  production can make use of fonts rather than chisels?"
