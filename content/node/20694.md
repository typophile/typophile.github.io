  about its origin on the net. One story is that a designer called Arthur Eisenmenger
  claimed to have made a sketch for the character which was later almost 1:1 used
  for the Euro Symbol. The EU Administration denies this and claims that there was
  not 1 individual designer behind it but a team. Anyone some more information on
  this?\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
