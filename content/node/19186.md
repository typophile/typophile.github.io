body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI'm currently cutting some characters for a translation of Frege's\r\n<em>Grundgesetze</em>
  and one of them, a variant infinity, has me \r\ncompletely baffled.  Has anyone
  seen anything like it before?\r\n\r\n  http://miles.shef.ac.uk/~jjg/infinity.jpg\r\n\r\n[I
  tried attaching the image but got \"File copy failed: no directory configured, \r\nor
  it could not be accessed\"]\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to think that this was something
  designed by Frege himself\r\nand cut by his printer (Hermann Pohl, Jenna, 1893);
  note the asymmetry \r\nin the overbar, the uniform width of the bowl strokes.  But
  Frege took \r\ngreat care in the typography of the <em>Grundgesetze</em> (and paid
  for \r\nits publication himself) so surely this cannot be the case.\r\n\r\nAny pointers
  would be most gratefully received!\r\n"

  body: "I know enough logic to be dangerous, but I am not familiar with Frege's notations,
    especially as originally published.\r\n\r\nMy undereducated guess is that this
    is a stylized lowercase \\omega with a wide inverted breve above. If I were drawing
    it, I'd use the same ductus (or lack thereof) as the \\union sign. The part below
    might indeed by a double\\union, but if it <em>does</em> mean some kind of infinity,
    \\omega makes more sense as it is often used as an infinity sign. I wouldn't worry
    about the asymmetry - if it had real meaning, I doubt it would be done that subtly.\r\n\r\nWhat
    methodology are you going to use to draw your fonts? If it's not too many glyphs
    and you don't have a strong attachment to doing it all yourself, I might be tempted
    to pitch in."

      I\u2019d use the same ductus (or lack thereof) as the \\union sign,</em>\r\n\r\nThat's
      what I've done for my first cut of it, but the lower\r\nand upper parts being
      in different styles jars a bit to my eye.\r\n\r\n<em>What methodology are you
      going to use to draw your fonts?</em>\r\n\r\nThe book will be set with TeX (what
      else!) and I'm doing the\r\nfont in metafont. Thanks for the offer of help.
      but it is \r\npretty much done now, I would be interested in comments though,\r\nsample
      at\r\n\r\n  http://miles.shef.ac.uk/~jjg/sample.pdf\r\n\r\n(900KB). The infinity
      is on page 4.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJim\r\n \r\n\r\n"
