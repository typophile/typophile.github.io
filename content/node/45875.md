  of my oldest friends are 5ish weeks away from having their first baby, and they're
  nowhere near a sense of what to name the lil pup. They're both designery and bookish,
  and quite like type. In fact, she's sitting across from me and just exclaimed \"Pica!
  We'll name it Pica! Or .. Franklin!\"\r\n\r\nSo, if you had to choose a type-inspired
  name for a baby, boy or girl, what would it be?  \r\n\r\nAll the reasonable guidelines
  apply, for example nothing unpronounceable or humiliating. Like, not 'Slug'.  :)\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    So if they're not afraid of having an eccentric kid (not only that, I guess they'd
    have to be really confident), Quaint Odwak actually sounds really good to me.
    I like eccentric. And it also seems to make sense! A quaint is something \u201Cattractively
    unusual\u201D (according to askoxford.com) \u2013 appart from the typographic
    meaning, of course \u2013, and then you've got \u201Codd\u201D and \u201Cwack\u201D
    or \u201Cwhack\u201D\u2026 I think it's a cool name to have! Although it probably
    wouldn't fit a girl very well.\r\nAnd it has unusual letters, too\u2026 a name
    with a Q, a W and a K? That's sweet! But of course, this kid's going to have to
    live with that name, I don't know how that would be\u2026 :P\r\n\r\nI'm also a
    big Seinfeld fan, and the George character wanted to name his kid Seven. Seven
    Odwak doesn't sound that bad to me. Nice for a girl! :P\r\n\r\nHow about Bell(e)
    Odwak? Trinit\xE9 Odwak? Tilde is like Tilda Swinton, the actress, so it's less
    \u201Cdifferent\u201D if they're not into something too weird\u2026 I like Zuzana,
