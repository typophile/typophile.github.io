  on the board? For use in a tech type illustration? <BR> <BR>Vectors? Anyone? <IMG

  body: 'Hey. <BR> <BR>A few months ago, I was looking into doing circuit board etching
    art. Ya know, where ya buy a circuit board that&#39;s covered in copper, lay down
    a resist and acid etch off the copper leaving that circuit board green behind?
    I was &#40;and am still&#41; considering silkscreening photos onto &#39;em, or
    doing circuit trace outlines. If ya google around, there&#39;s PC programs to
    layout circuit traces. With all the useful circular endpoints &#40;pads&#41;,
    etc. Dunno if it&#39;d just be easier to whip out Illustrator, but... <BR> <BR>David
    Roughs <BR> <BR>p.s. Or you could use a pre-done layout off the web, like from
    this <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/tech/mp3/pcb_layout_revc.html">page</a>: <BR><img
