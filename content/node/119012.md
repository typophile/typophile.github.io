  body: "I didn't spot a font that matched these Spanish wine shop letters.\r\nHere
    is a somewhat similar font of about the right stroke thickness based on lettering
    found on buildings constructed in Spain's Andalucian region in the 1930's and
    1940's. John Chippindale's Avenida \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Avenida_A-M_5050.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Avenida_N-Z_5276.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Avenida_lc_a-m_6592.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Avenida_lc_n-z_5436.gif]
