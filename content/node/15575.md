  here</a>) and while I had no input on that (it was designed before my time here),
  I've been asked to design a companion display face -- for use in the company magazine
  etc.\r\n\r\nMy first draft is attached, I'm not sure about:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The
  '2' -- mainly the bowl at the top.</li>\r\n<li>The 's' -- apart from the fact that
  it looks as though it's falling backwards, I can't bring myself to make it wholly
  geometric (and thus very thin), but it looks flattened otherwise. Any suggestions?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAny
  comments on these glyphs, or anything else about the face, would be most appreciated
  everybody.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    customizing <em>( a, b, g, m, n, q, r, y )</em> 'Century Gothic' instead of building
    a 'new' custom typeface, from scratch.? :) <em>( Because the logo itself sure
    could be based on 'Century Gothic'.. )</em>\r\n\r\nOtherwise I may add that I
    quite like it, but it still looks a bit uneven.. <em>( Especially where the curves
    'meet' the stems.. And you are right about the 's', it may seem too narrow and
    it doesnt really fit in there.. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav, <a href=\"http://www.formlos.net\"

  body: "Thanks for the reply Dav (and 'too harsh' should not be in the vocabularly
    of a critic!).\r\n\r\nWhy not just customise a cut of CG? Well, aside from the
    dubious ethics ;), mainly because I didn't want to just build a customised century
    gothic. I even forced myself to not look at any samples of it while designing
    this :)\r\n\r\nI wanted to create something with a <em>little</em> originality
    (and I think a number of letterforms in cimex bold -- including those you mentioned
    and more -- are distinct enough from CG to make this more than just a customised
    version of it). In addition, I'm also building a cursive (with no oblique-ing)
    version that I think will definitely add something unique.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've
    never been entirely sure (on a technical level) what the best way of sorting out
    the curve-->straight transition in a geometric typeface is. Any pointers would
    be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm still totally stumped about how to handle
    a geometric 's' without making it absurdly thin or too flat. I'm at the point
    of thinking of going for something completely radical, like a descender ..."

  body: "Well, and then there is the question of if you would want to dilute the brand
    by using a font for text or headlines that too similar too the logo's own face.
    I think that what you are on track to do is bad marketing practice. Which is a
    pain in the a** thing to say if that meant that I thought you should abandon your
    font. But I don't. I think it's a cool project. So I suggest\r\n\r\nYou make a
    font that relates too the logo but isn't *so* close. Then it might be wonderful.
    But what you are making right now does seem way too close to me.\r\n\r\nIt might
    be good for inspiration for your new font in faces which use a really round looking
    O. \r\n\r\nWhat about Mark Simonson's Proxima Nova? http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html\r\n\r\nWhat
    about a Gil Sans?\r\n\r\nNow to  be a real buzzkill: you could use the fonts I
    mentioned. But that would be less fun I suppose. Proxima Nova is awefully nice....\r\n\r\n"
