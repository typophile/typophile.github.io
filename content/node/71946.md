body: "Whilst googling I stubled upon two sites, eaglefonts and fontslog that offer
  truetype and opentype fonts respectively. And I noticed they offer a lot of original,
  certainly not free, typefaces. It seems to be a decent website, not spammed over.
  But no information about copyrights or anything. They only offer this BS line, with
  obviously no substance whatsoever: \r\n\r\n\"All fonts on the FontsLog site remain
  copyright of their respective owners. All fonts can be found elsewhere on the Internet,
  either as individual fonts or as complete font sets and are believed to be in the
  public domain. If you find any font on FontsLog for which you are the copyright
  holder, under the conditions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act you may submit
  a Take-down Request by clicking the red flag  beside the font name on the font's
  detailed view page. We will endeavour to investigate your request and take the appropriate
  action ASAP.\"\r\n\r\nThey obviously stretch the definition of public domain until
  it includes just about anything. You are all warned. As for copyright owners and
  foundries: shouldn't action be taken to close this down?\r\n\r\nPS Sorry moderators
  I don't intend to post links for people to download obviously but I do feel the
  need to inform about these sites. Please correct me if I'm wrong\r\n "

    you click on the Opentype link on eaglefonts it will take you to fontslog. If
    you are on fontslog and click on the Truetype link it will take you to eaglefonts.\r\n\r\nThey
    are both hosted at ThePlanet in Houston, TX but are hiding behind a Private Registration
    organization in the Netherlands.\r\n"

    these assclowns causes more harm than good. If I''m spending time getting hundreds
    of free font sites to include my EULA, I''m not making new fonts. Screw it. The
    only time I bother is if a site is offering a significant number of my commercial
    fonts for free and telling visitors that they''re freeware. Usually they take
    them down if I ask politely. If they don''t leave contact info, I just shut their
    sites down. '

    for some monotype fonts, and then a while later saw apparently similar \"public
    domain\" fonts on that site - my first though was that I'd just wasted a few hundred
    bucks! Normally, I would've just assumed they were pirate versions, but the ads
    definitely give the site an air of legitimacy.\r\n\r\nHow the hell do foundries
    keep track of these things?"

    mainly a problem because Google('s ads/searches) are totally complicit with piracy.
    It's the larger places with a more traditional b2c/b2b mindset who buy the Google
    ads. Most foundries are small and keep things close and manageable."

    \u2014 it\u2019s quite indiscriminate and difficult to stay on top of.) \r\n\r\nSeveral
    C&D take-down notices are also being pursued regarding pirated fonts."

    removed my fonts, and left a link to my site.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\nhttp://www.fontslog.com/handsomepro-classic-otf-5613.htm\r\n\r\nNonetheless,
    I do think the statement that \"All fonts found at FontsLog.com were collected
    from other public domains and were believed to be free for download...\" is disingenuous.\r\n\r\nPutting
    the onus on the publisher to correct copyright infractions is a lazy way to do
    business for what is clearly a commercial font, as Shinntype has been publishing
    commercial-only fonts for 10 years, and there is an \"all rights reserved\" copyright
    notice in the font info.\r\n\r\nWhat this business should do to be entirely reputable
    is open up every font it re-distributes, in FontLab or whatever, and inspect the
    copyright info."

  body: "I also noticed that Linotype are very activily using google ads. Just type
    fonts in google and they are always there, and several font sites that feature
    adwords also have linotype ads, and apprently not only the legal nice ones...\r\n\r\nI
    noticed that you could even try typing Linotype or another foundry in the search
    box and get a list of fonts, as the search also recognises copyright strings in
    the fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm glad they are responsive to your requests Nick, but it should
    really be the other way around. What bother me is the feeling of legitimacy that
    is created. This might trick unknowing designers into using them. But I guess
    that any (free)font site that has no info about itself, it's organisation structure
    etc. should be suspect. But I guess this kind of thing is very hard to crack down
    in the world of internet."
