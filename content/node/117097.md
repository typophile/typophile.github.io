  body: Kudos!  I'm sure Bauer Gable Antique was the basis for this.  As it was just
    a single logo for printing the book spines, it appears to me that it was a custom
    made plate, since the letters are never identical,  Thanks for your help.

  body: "Mephisto matches what Dan Solo shows as 'Washington Antique' in the Solotype
    Catalog. May or may not be the original name. Also available as 'Thuvia' by Michael
    Lee, who interestingly states in the ReadMe that he based the font on letters
    on the covers of some Edgar Rice Burroughs books.\r\n\r\nI'd have to agree with
    Ryuk that Mephisto (Thuvia) is closest. Thuvia is easily found on the Web, but
    I don't find it on any reputable site I want to link to."

  body: "The name Thuvia is derived, of course from Burroughs' \"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\",
    one of the John Carter stories.  Do a google search for thuvia images, and you'll
    find the book cover that must have inspired Lee.\r\n\r\nBut I think Ryuk nailed
    it with Bauer's Gable.  As I noted above, the only uses for this font are on the
    book spine, and none of the letters are identical to one another (e,g, all 3 O's
    and both E's are different) which I assume to be inconsistent with any kind of
    manufactured type.  My theory is that in 1894 someone at Tribune Printing designed
    a one-off plate for use on the spines and modeled it after the then-new Bauer
    Gable (which may have been available in an uncondensed version at that time).
    \ I ultimately did the same thing--tracing the image and having a magnesium engraving
    made."

  body: "Bauer's Gable is almost 100% identical to a font cut by Gustave F. Schroeder
    for the Central Type Foundry decades earlier, with three widths Lafayette, Jefferson
    and Washington. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/JeffersonBySchroeder@Central_3671.jpg]\r\nThe
    book title has the middle, i.e. Jefferson, width.\r\nBTW Solo's Washington is
    the name used by another foundry for a clone of Jefferson.\r\nCloning was thriving
    in the era. Jefferson spawned Washington and Gable.\r\nClones also included Webster.\r\nDon"

  body: "Christian, the full alphabet is in Phillips Old Fashioned Type Book published
    in 1945. There are a few copies in North American university libraries available
    for interlibrary loan.\r\nWord samples were the usual practice for display fonts
    in specimen books until well into the 20th century. Finding a full alphabet for
    19th century display fonts is often impossible. Some were patented. The patent
    images are available online, but many are very poor quality because the original
    patent documents were destroyed after being microfilmed. The microfilm photographs
    -- now used for the digital records -- are often crap.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "I confirm George's opinion that it is an excellent resource. Phillips assembled
    an collection of old metal type, in much the same way that Dan X. Solo did a few
    decades later.  Phillips has a better assortment of Victorians.\r\nNote that the
    full character sets are usually for 10 to 18 point impressions and are not as
    crisp as the limited phrases you can find in some of the old specimen books.\r\nThe
    prices George quotes are reasonable for what you get. Note that since you do not
    live in the USA you have to add international shipping. Different sellers have
    very different rates for international shipments. Many refuse to ship outside
    the USA, which I find to be very short sighted. But as Kurt Vonnegut always said
    when confronted by stupidity, \"such is life.\"\r\nDon"
