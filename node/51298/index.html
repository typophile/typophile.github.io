  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Microsoft had released Language support for many Indian Languages with WindowsXP. Crude and badly designed, the Malayalam typeface Karthika is an eyesore. With badly formed shapes, incorrect spacing and incorrect conjunct formation, the typeface and language support really mocks the language. Obviosuly people who didn't know the language were involved and made a mess out of it. On top of it, the OpenType/ Unicode support given is faulty and gives more disservice to the language.

Some improvement was expected over the years, but nothing has happened. Unfortunately for want of a choice, people are using it for blogs and sites as if this is the norm/ default. This is likely to corrupt typography in the language and general aethetics forever.

As a langauge lover and type designer in the language what can be done?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/malayalam_3550.gif]</div>

What we need in Malayalam is something like Verdana or Georgia (or even Helvetica and Times), tuned for the screen and looking neat too. 

The made-for print fonts are too rounded to suit the purpose. Micrososft's Karthika could have looked and worked better had some linguists and designers who know the language were genuinely involved.

		<div class="commentbody">I was Prof. Joshi's student and he passed away this February. He was been my source of inspiration too to get into language typography which hasn't kept apace with developments in technology. He was more into Devanagari typography, but I believe was also involved with Microsoft's Indian language efforts to some extent. But Indian scripts being many and so diverse one cannot expect one person to be an expert in all of them. 

Turning on ClearType will makes it slightly better, but exaggerates its bad shapes further. I believe for on screen-reading bitmap fonts work best with B&W pixels— Verdana nd Gorgia being the best models to emulate. The language technology part needs to be corrected first, with better and more acceptable conjunct formations and then the shapes which needs to be screen-friendly. merely replicating the print fonts for on-screen use is also hampering other Indian languages, to the best of my knowledge.

Linotype Manorama designed by Fiona Ross is a good evolutionary model, though may not suitable for on-screen viewing. We need original designs which are hand-tuned for the screen.

		<div class="commentbody">No doubt. Prof. Joshi was the right person, but I wish linguists and type designers in the language were also consulted before designing the default typefaces in each language. I have heard similar complaints from other friends speaking different Indian languages.

I can help with Malayalam if needed, having designed many typefaces in Malayalam (www.design-difference.com/typedes.htm). But the Unicode/ OpenType problem also needs to be addressed simultaneously to make it acceptable to a larger audience.

As you know there are two versions of Malayalam rendering: the traditional one (as recommended by Rachana, a group that recommends close to 900 characters to bring the language back to its original glory) and the reformed one (INSCRIPT/ C-DAC Gist with about 150 characters) which is more popular other than those used by various publishing houses (Summit's Indica, Mathrubhumi'system etc.). Karthika doesnot even match upto the INSCRIPT standards, bringing down typography in the language a few notches down. Script reformation in the 60's was an ill-thought-out step to make typewriters handle Malayalam, but Windows implementation corrupts the language further.

So Unicode is broken!? Well respectfully until you fix that issue any Unicode compliant solution (like Uniscribe and ICU) isn't going to support your scheme.

The general public may be blind to it and may even be resigned to use it everywhere as there is no alternative. But typographers in the language have been lamenting about it ever since Karthika was released. I can give you a list of problems if you are interested in a few days time.

In the Open Source domain, you can come across frequent communication regarding the incomplete Unicode impementation. But I am no expert on that, but can connect you to experts, if you are interested.

Print-specific fonts may not work well on-screen. Otherwise we would still be using Caslon, Baskerville and Garamond instead of Verdana, Georgia and Trebuchet.

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding Unicode encoding—to the best of my knowledge—the disagreement is regarding the conjunct formation. Whether there should be 150 or 900. Can't OpenType fonts use this choice differently in different fonts, so that the user has a choice between say Kartika (traditional script) and Kartika (reformed script)?

Also Simon, the tools that you have shown wrt Verdana are Mac-specific and may no longer be available. Is there is a modern day option to go the same way? Does FontLab + BitFonter on PC suffice or are there any proprietary software being used nowadays? I am keen to explore possibilities.</div>

I would assume if this were possible someone would have done it, however it seems unlikely. 

>Is there is a modern day option 

The proces (draw bitmaps, then draw outlines, and then hint the outlines to match the bitmaps) does not make any sense today for Windows and Mac OS fonts as these OS's don't rasterize bi-level any more. Not sure what tools you might use to repeat this as an accademic excercize, mabybe bitfonter, FontLab and VTT.

Can you meanwhile give us some insight into the process of design of your screen fonts other than Verdana: Georgia, Trebuchet and the new ones? Are there any sites or useful links?</div>
