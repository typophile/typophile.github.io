body: When using small caps in a leading line and you have what would normally be
  capitalized letters within it, (for example, someones name) do you make those normal
  sized capitol letters in line the small caps, or just all lowercase small caps?
  What is best practice for this, which is more traditional...

    caps, or just all <strong>lowercase</strong> small caps?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNot
    sure I understand the question -- the reference to \"leading line.\" Do you mean
    the first line following, say, some kind of space break, where the style is to
    set the first few words (or an entire line) in small caps?\r\n\r\nIf so, my informal
    survey is most designers just use small caps. But there is no hard and fast rule,
    and editors are a little more wont to insist on a full cap for that initial character
    (i.e., a cap-small cap style). \r\n\r\nThink of it this way: There really aren't
    any \"lowercase\" small caps. You could set those words in full caps -- sometimes
    done, but less commonly seen. It is all a design decision, and as such, is sometimes
    overridden by editorial convictions.\r\n\r\nIf the decision is yours and you strongly
    believe a reader will be negatively affected by one choice, you pick the other.
    But it is amazing the number of arguments proffered about what will negatively
    affect a reader, most of them turning out to be wrong."

  body: Generally, if I am setting only the first phrase in sc, I will leave the initial
    letter full cap, but use no other full caps within the phrase, even for words
    that would normally be capitalized. If I am setting the entire first line in sc,
    I don't even capitalize the first letter.

  body: "Well, I frequently look at the words involved, and if there really isn't
    any reason to use cap & small cap structure for clarity, I can sometimes use the
    fact that a line of small caps looks a bit like a rule. You can use them to echo
    certain kinds of rules that might be used in a chapter opening or subhead. \r\n\r\nNot
    as an echo of a  solid black hairline rule, but certainly a thicker, gray rule,
    or a \"rule\" made up of small vertical lines, one default of \"rules\" in InDesign.\r\n\r\nIn
    other words, once any need or cap & small cap is eliminated for clarity (& usually
    it can be), the graphic qualities of small (or full) caps can be exploited.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: Indeed. I really like the sturdiness of a first line set entirely in sc. It
    just looks so good, especially if you can print it in a second color. Often, mixing
    in full caps ruins the visual effect.
