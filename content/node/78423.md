body: "I'd added some glyphs to a font with FontLab Studio and when generating the
  font in OTF, I can't use them. When generating TTF (and in preview in the app itself)
  everything works fine and when I press ALT + L, I get '\u0142', but not with generated
  OTF. Is this a matter of some settings in OTF? What can I do?"

  body: Does the font have OpenType features and, if so, did you compile the features
    without error messages? Did you do a Quick Test as OpenType? Are the new characters
    mapped properly?

    nice in Quick Test as Open Type. Characters are (or I think so) mapped right the
    way they should.\r\n\r\nI got only the warning: Use of DFLT tag has been deprecated.
    It will work, but please use 'dflt' instead."

  body: "<em>Characters are (or I think so) mapped right the way they should</em>\r\n\r\nSelect
    All characters, then <strong>Glyph &gt; Glyph Names &gt; Generate Unicode</strong>.
    Look for any glyphs whose names appear against a red bar, which indicates that
    either the glyphname is incorrect, the Unicode is wrong or mssing, or multiple
    glyphs are mapped to the same codepoints.\r\n\r\nAlso, what program are you using
    to test your finished font?"

    was a problem while compiling OpenType font. Final .otf font is not saved. Please,
    check OpenType features definition for errors.\r\n\r\nI read a lot and done a
    lot to fix this but nothing seem to work. I'll just stick to TTF for now. I don't
    need OTF to be honest, but just thought that it would be nice to solve that kind
    of problem for future work."
