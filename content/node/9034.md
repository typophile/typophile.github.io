  that looks like this, or close to it. But nothing! Thought I&#39;d see if any of
  you experts have any clue. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64530.jpg"

  body: I think there was too much &#39;artistic license&#39; being taken with whatever
    letters the artist was copying from. It seems the bottoms of the M were made to
    go that way because of the contours of the body, for the purposes of design, rather
    than to be a faithful rendering of a typeface. I&#39;ve done enough hand-lettering
    to know how quickly the medium dictates the lettering you use. <BR> <BR>In other
    words, I don&#39;t think this is a font now, even if it was &#39;inspired&#39;
    by one.
