  diagonals as the weights of characters increase in typeface families? Oblique and
  upright - throughout weights and styles?\r\n\r\nIt appears that diagonal angles,
  for example of the 4 and the flag of 1, in upright character sets, become more gradual
  (less steep) in pitch as they increase in weight. I understand that these design
  decisions are often required to avoid the massing of weight as stroke thickness
  increases... but has anyone discussed this (in published works) and is there a precedent
  set?\r\n\r\nMy observations are mostly based on Geometric sans serifs but also sans
  in general!"

  body: 'But the increase of weight (and the proportional system that widely dictates
    the process of weighting type families) uses the middle of strokes as a central
    axis for widening, ie glyphs are not technically widened, they are thickened and
    therefore widen as a result. This doesn''t explain a change in angle... That would
    only occur with stretching, with a falsely emboldened character (MS Word etc)
    or an expanded version - surely it''s an adjustment made outside/beyond/after
    the proportional system due to optical issues? '

    bold don\u2019t change the angle, because it\u2019s evenly applied horizontally.\r\nAs
    Martin shows, the angle is changed in relation to the counters, and in relation
    to constrains like x/caps height (think of |z| and |Z|).\r\n"

  body: By the way, I recently noticed a typeface where the bolder the weight is,
    the larger the x-height. When is this appropriate to do?
