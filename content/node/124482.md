body: Hi! I got a tattoo three years ago and am trying to match up the font I used
  as I cannot find the original file. Any help you can give would be so much appreciated.
  I know it's most likely in the Germanic Medieval area. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3306_5810.JPG]

  body: "The lettering of your tattoo is the Latin phrase \"Aut viam inveniam aut
    faciam\" which  means \"I Shall either find a way or make one.\" I expect that
    the tattoo artists have it in their collection of alphabets. Compare your tattoo
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aut_viam_inveniam_aut_faciam_4107.jpg] to
    one from tatoaline.co.kr [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aut_viam_inveniam_aut_faciam@tatoaline_co_kr_3714.jpg]\r\nThe
    lettering is in a blackletter style called textura. As for retail digital fonts
    that are similar to this tattoo lettering, there are revivals of  Rudolf Koch's
    \"Fette Deutsche Schrift\" such as the one by Jos\xE9 Alberto Mauricio at Alter
    Littera [img:sites/default/files/old-images/DeutscheSchriftasAut_4774.gif] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/alterlittera/deutsche-schrift/\r\nDon"
