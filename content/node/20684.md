  body: "\"Sun's logo, which features four interleaved copies of the word sun, was
    designed by professor Vaughan Pratt, also of Stanford University. The initial
    version of the logo had the sides oriented horizontally and vertically, but it
    was subsequently redesigned so as to appear to stand on one corner.\"\r\n\r\nfrom
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems\">Wikipedia</a>.\r\n\r\nLooks
    like a swastika to me."
