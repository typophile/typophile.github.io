    that it is the best font editor out there... but there are sooooo many rough spots...
    and very few if any incremental updates to fix bugs.  I wish adobe would work
    their magic on it."

    great to be able to see more text set, than in the metrics window."

  body: "Goran, \r\n\r\nWhat do you exactly mean by \"it doesn\u2019t work\"? Please
    be more specific. \r\n\r\nIf a font can be generated, it works in Quick Test.
    If a font does not work in Quick Test, it simply means that the font cannot be
    properly generated and installed on the system (because it\u2019s all that Quick
    Test does, really). Therefore, you should verify how your OpenType features compile,
    if the font can be generated and if it can be installed on your system. (FontBook\u2019s
    reluctance to install some perfectly valid fonts may be one of the problems if
    you\u2019re on Mac OS X). \r\n\r\nScruggsdesign, \r\n\r\nso far, Adobe\u2019s
    magic on font software they acquired (Esselte FontStudio, Ares FontChameleon)
    resulted in a complete vanishing from the market. \r\n\r\nFortunately, before
    Adobe bought Macromedia, somebody there suggested that Macromedia should spin
    off Fontographer to a more dedicated party (as it happened, it was Fontlab Ltd.)
    I have no doubt that had Fontographer gone into Adobe\u2019s vast software repository,
    it would share the fate of other great programs that they let bleed out, e.g.
    FrameMaker. It\u2019s simply that Adobe has too many software applications in
    their hands, and cannot develop them all, plus the font tools market is too tiny
    for them. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m not entirely sure what you mean by \"very few if any
    incremental updates to fix bugs\", I would appreciate if you could elaborate on
    that. For FontLab Studio 5, we have released two incremental bugfixes (5.0.1 and
    5.0.2) after the initial release, we are also considering the release of 5.0.3
    in the coming months. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

  body: "Adam,\r\n\r\nto be more specific: When I do a quick test on any font (even
    the Freefont Pro that came with FontLab) all I see in the window is Geneva, not
    the font I wanted to Quick Test. It seems as if it\u2019s trying to do it\u2019s
    job, but when the \"rendering\" is over all I see is this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quicktest_4836.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    is from the FreeFontPro-file. But it\u2019s the same on any font. I\u2019m on
    an Ibook G4, OSX 10.4.8.\r\n\r\nDo you know what could be the problem?\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I tried to install the font via Apples Font Book and it worked fine there. Also
    in Suitcase and in the InDesign folder \u201DFonts\u201D. But not the Quick Test
    in FontLab.\r\n"

    font, there are stored binary OpenType Layout tables, and you may choose which
    information you want to use -- those stored binary tables or tables compiled from
    the code that is in the OpenType panel. Of course you can remove either the ones
    or the other, or you can control this behavior in Preferences. \r\n\r\nA."
