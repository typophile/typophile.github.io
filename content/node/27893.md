  body: "The H's look more like they were customized from <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/boulevard-be/\">Boulevard</a>,
    but the lower case is not Boulevard at all, or Kuenstler either, with that 'r'.
    The lower case could be borrowed from a number of scripts, like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atcitadel-script/\">Citadel</a>,
    or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/classic-script/\">Classic
    script</a>.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
