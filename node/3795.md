  describe typefaces. <BR>The profile should build on design- and emotional attributes.  <BR>
  <BR>Has anyone worked with semantic profiles and can me help !? <BR> <BR>Thank you

  body: hey Martin,  <BR> <BR>your name sounds german to me. If so, I can recommend
    Klaus Hesse&#39;s &#34;Der Helvetica-Mann&#34; and a few older articles in the
    Page-magazine by Christian Gutschi &#34;Psychologie der Schriften&#34;. I&#39;m
    working on a similar project.
