<div class=commentbody>Ooh, I have a question on this topic too: Are small caps meant to be used with full-sized caps? I notice that the full size caps often look heavier and does not seem to go all that well with the small caps. <br> <br>Someone also said that when they are not slightly taller than the lowercase characters, they suck. And I tend to agree, although "suck" is a strong word. <br> <br>It's somewhere on this forum. I just can't find it now. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Small caps are designed heavier than what a scaled-down <br>version of the full caps would be(*) exactly so that <br>the composition has an even color - i.e. the full caps <br>don't "look heavier" (except to the extent that they <br>naturally should, if it's the case). <br> <br>Also, about proportions: a sweeping comment like "when <br>they are not slightly taller than the lc characters, they <br>suck" doesn't make much sense. It can often be the case, <br>but depends of course on the original proportions of UC/lc <br>to begin with. In faces with a large x-height they'll <br>probably look better if they're the same height as the lc. <br> <br>(*) This is not the only difference between a small-cap <br>and a scaled-down full cap.</div>

<div class=commentbody>As I'm starting to understand it... and it would certainly explain a lot... <br> <br>... (if you don't have small caps for a certain typeface) using the small caps function is akin to using faux bolds and italics? A computer-generated interpretation? <br> <br>d'oh. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> They look cramped <br> <br>That's a good point, although I don't think it's a huge factor; some lc letters are more cramped than most UC letters. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>a) I think larger size is in fact the best way to disambiguate them.

<div class=commentbody>1) A face that doesn't have enough room for smallcaps between the x-height and the fullcap-height isn't a text font, so naturally Regularity becomes/can_become more important - you can freely sacrifice readability. <br>2) There's virtually zero harm in confusing smallcaps with fullcaps (I mean in their usual usage of acronyms in running text, as opposed to fancy titling), while there is in confusing them with lc. <br> <br>So you could conclude that a font with a huge x-height doesn't need smallcaps that much. <br> <br>And I personally would go further: a good text face has very short caps (much shorter than current -or past- convention) - it doesn't need smallcaps, at least not that much - there are [generally] more important things to worry about. Not least because virtually nobody uses smallcaps, even if the font has it right under their noses... <br> <br>> +0.2pt <br> <br>I don't know how much larger they need to be - it simply has to be a visible difference, in fact some distance into the parafovea. BTW, it's interesting that the smaller the point size the larger the absolute difference necessary. The problem here is that at very smaller point sizes the x-height needs to be larger too - I guess one could conclude that smallcaps have little place in tiny typography. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Good catch. I was sloppy. <br> <br>The first part assumes conventional proportions - caps slightly smaller than ascenders. Which is why when x-height/cap-height is too large, so is x-height/ascenders (a key factor in readability). In fact my proposal (making caps notably smaller than ascenders) goes hand-in-hand with reducing the necessity of smallcaps. Is that clearer? <br> <br>BTW, I think necessity is simply relative. An ideal face will have smallcaps (even if the x-height is large), but to me it's much more important to have sized masters, for example - which very few people do. Too many people are making smallcaps (not to mention the dreaded Unicase) instead of spending the time on more important things. And it seems to be a peer-pressure situation. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

I make most of them wider, more open with generally lower contrast between the letter widths. The eyes still the best judge at the end. Note that the OsF figures match the SC in weight and size.</div>
