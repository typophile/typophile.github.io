  body: <i>IF</i> it is a typeface, it&#39;s most likely been customized. <BR>Check
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/normande/italic/testdrive.html?s=Crazy%20Penis&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Normande Italic</a> for similarities, but notice for  <BR>example
    the extravagant shape of the lc &#39;z&#39;. The  <BR>dotting of the lc &#39;i&#39;
    by the tail of the lc &#39;y&#39; is quite  <BR>nifty, I must say.

  body: thanks yves, thats pretty close, but i&#39;m sure there is a typeface closer
    to this one as i&#39;ve seen it used in other designs. <BR> <BR>that would be
    good david, ask him what typeface he used. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>has he got a website?
    i&#39;m a dj and have always liked the paperecordings sleeve designs, would be
    good to see some of his other work.

  body: i&#39;ve been comparing it more with normande and checking out a few similar
    typefaces of that era. it has a very distinctive &#34;z&#34; and i haven&#39;t
    been able to find many other typefaces which are similar. <BR> <BR>if it is normande
    as yves said it has been heavily customised ie. the uc &#34;C&#34; and &#34;P&#34;,
    the &#34;a&#34;, &#34;z&#34; and &#34;n&#34; etc. also normande italic has more
    of a slant than the logotype characters. <BR> <BR>the other instance i&#39;ve
    seen the typeface used the uc &#34;H&#34; and &#34;S&#34; had serifs that curled
    into dots. unfortunately i don&#39;t have an example at hand, i&#39;ll have to
    check it again.
