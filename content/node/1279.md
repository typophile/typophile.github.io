body: Hi <BR> <BR>I was interested to see that a &#39;Large Foundry&#39; have threatened
  legal action against Cape Arcona Fonts for a font name which is similar. And that
  Cape Arcona have changed the name of that font as a result. <BR> <BR>I wondered
  if anyone knows where the law stands on this kind of issue, are there any cases
  where this has reached court. <BR> <BR>As a german based firm, is Cape Arcona liable
  to the law as it is judged in Germany, or can it be called to account by a US firm
  in the US where copyright of font name is more strongly protected. <BR> <BR>Jim

  body: So, don&#39;t hate the game, hate the playa? <BR>__ <BR> <BR>Jim, I believe
    that&#39;s the case in the US also. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a legal game of chicken,
    played by people with money  <BR>to scare the people without money. <BR> <BR>Speaking
    generally &#40;since the practice isn&#39;t limited to the  <BR>type industry&#41;
    it&#39;s common for firm A to threaten firm B,  <BR>in full knowledge that they
    &#40;firm A&#41; don&#39;t have the legal  <BR>grounds to win. They just know
    firm B doesn&#39;t have the  <BR>funds to engage in a long legal battle. In many
    instances  <BR>firm B would go bankrupt before they could win and have  <BR>their
    court costs paid by firm A. So firm B just has to suck it  <BR>up and change their
    behavior or compete differently or  <BR>whatever the issue is. <BR> <BR>I should
    finish by saying I&#39;m all for the use of the law when  <BR>it&#39;s necessary
    to protect legitimate copyrights / trademarks / <BR>trade names / trade dress
    / et cetera. It just pains me when  <BR>people can&#39;t see how to make a real
    living and just sue as a  <BR>way to eliminate competition. <BR>

    COSMO who was to similiar to Bertholds font COSMO. <BR>And after that, Bethold
    claimed, that the announcement that they renamed the font is not legal and that
    they must rename CA COSMOLAB to some other name WITHOUT mention that to CA customes.
    It&#39;s insane! <BR>Haha, on a sidenote, they say &#34;thank you&#34; to the

    with Joe about wondering why the FF DIN name was not an issue. Maybe because both
    the Letraset one and FF one are derived from the original German highway one,
    and <i>that</i> one is in the public domain? In the same way that there are many
    fonts that look like Interstate, but FontBureau can&#39;t complain. <BR> <BR>&#42;

    <BR> <BR>Just like all Letraset dry-transfer lettering, the character spacing
    is defined by little tick marks positioned at the baseline of each character.
    By matching up the ends of the ticks, you would approach reasonably correct letter
    spacing. &#40;Subjective kerning and tracking decisions aside.&#41; As you said,
