  body: "I like the leaf graphic, but it may not be immediately recognizable as church
    from the graphic alone. The sans \"CORNERSTONE\" lettering seems spaced to closely,
    especially on the bottom one. I'm not particularly fond of that sans font. Doesn't
    seem solid enough for a place with the name Cornerstone. On the bottom graphic,
    try modulating the white horizontal curving line to make it more calligraphic.
    Also, lowercase looks bad letterspaced. Instead, having the \"Faith Fellowship\"
    align right might look good. The \"Faith Fellowship\" is also pretty lightweight
    compared to everything else in the bottom one. The C graphic in the second one
    is nice, but does not match any of the the font choices. The C in the 3rd one
    is kinda awkward--should lean more towards either a recognizable graphic (what
    is going on?) or a letter (is that a G?). I hope these suggestions are helpful
    to you--its just the stuff that immediately came to mind. Those logos are great
    to start from.\r\nEron"

  body: "To me, the bottom one says \"church\" the clearest. The top would be my second
    choice. For some reason, I think \"community college\" when I look at the second
    and third logos.\r\n\r\nFor the bottom one, I agree that \"CORNERSTONE\" could
    use a little space, both between the letters, and on either side. Try to match
    the space on the sides with the space on the top. It looks off that there's so
    little space in \"CORNERSTONE\" and so much in \"Faith Fellowship\". The letterspacing
    in the latter doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThere should also be more space between the
    two lines of text. The text seems too close to the image below as well (the sun
    is almost poking Fellowship's 'i' out :P).\r\n\r\nWhat type of church is this?
    Most religions have a symbol that can identify them easily. Was the decision to
    leave out a Cross / Star of David / &c. intentional?\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "What are your communication goals, Jeremy? As others have pointed out and
    I agree with, these logos don't say 'church' or even \"religion' to me, so clearly
    you have other driving factors. If you are avoiding religious iconography simply
    because they are \"overdone\", I think your reason for avoiding them is not very
    strong. I'm trying to imagine the client meeting with church representatives where
    you tell them about playing down the religious aspect. Is there something in the
    client's creative brief or desires that led you in this direction?\r\n\r\nFrankly,
    a well-chosen typeface and sensitive typesetting will take you much further than
    any of the imagery you've used. (One example that I've seen on book covers and
    some films is H&FJ's <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/index.html\">Requiem</a>.
    I think you might be trapping yourself into doing something that feels generic
    for non-churches in an effort to avoid the generic for churches. Christian institutions
    have been integral in design, art, and architecture for centuries. There's more
    than enough there to draw from without falling on overdone solutions. Much of
    it is subtle and can be incorporated with stylistic choices, rather than direct
    references (crosses, doves, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis is an instance where your logos
    aren't bad, per se, just perhaps not as appropriate as they could be."

    the client is looking for, they aren't looking for something \"too crazy\". Small
    town, small church. \r\n\r\nMy reason for not using doves and crosses is that
    the company that contracted me the job has told me on other similar jobs not to
    use such imagery. There's always a way to use traditional imagery in a new way
    though. I guess I could have tried since this particular church didn't say that,

    \r\n\r\nAlso I don't see the point in avoiding the Cross. I'm not a Christian,
    but if I were I think I'd see the Cross as very positive, particularly if I were
    looking for a church to join. To me the logical solution includes a cross and
    a more human font, like one of Goudy's. <a href=\"http://www.lcms.org/\">Here's</a>
    an example of the feeling I am talking about. Ok, that example has a bit too much
    swooshiness, but you get the idea. \"The obvious is better than the obvious avoidance
    of the obvious\". If you can be innovative as well, fine, but something more conventional
    that works is good too.\r\n\r\nAlso, speaking of Goudy, he said 'Anyone who would
    letter space lower case would steal sheep.' And Erik Spiekermann wrote a whole
    book \"Stop Stealing Sheep.\" There are better solutions. "

    so they have something to put on the sign and their letterhead. Kudos to them
    for paying for something that matches and looks good rather than something haphazard
    and impromptu.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that this church is Christian (with \"cornerstone\"
    and all), and if so, I like the image of the leaves in the first example (\"I
    am the vine, you are the branches...\"). But, I agree with the others that you
    need type that is warmer, more inviting, and far less corporate. For this reason,
    I like the way you set \"Cornerstone\" in the third example. Lowercase just seems
    more friendly (but, please not <em>all</em> lowercase a la at&t).\r\n\r\n"

    imply flexibility rather than rigid (thinking, faith). Take a look at Caps and

    unlike a rock (cornerstone). Try for a friendly inviting look, not a corporate
    product oriented look.
