IFMSA(international federation of medicine students associations) ED will assist in diferent ways all over the world in case on an emergency or disaster <BR> <BR>the mission was to design a simbol that includes E&amp;D, i replace de ampersan with the plus symbol because it reminds me like a red cross but obviously with other colors. i use a simple language with the E and D and try to show a unified world for this cause. the letters are DIN from fontshop international beacuase i find it very transparent and simple thinking on the universality of the logo.  <BR>Once a have all done, the solution of the E and D remids me too much to the CE of the European Union, is just me or this means reconsider the logo? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26755.gif" alt="logo"> <BR> <BR> <BR>i also develop a poster to call for apllications, what do you think about it? <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26756.gif" alt="poster"> <BR> <BR> <BR>thanks for the feedback</div>

		<div class="commentbody">cristian, this is a case where the context sure helps. i initially felt that your symbol was too busy (and it certainly does contain many elements). but after seeing it on the poster i think it works very well! <BR> <BR>but i do think that if that logo needs to stand alone on a letterhead or some small mailer, it would be nice to have a version without as many words. the reason i think it works well on the poster is that the green bar and text become a headline to the copy of the poster. they're somewhat removed from the logo because of their function. <BR> <BR>nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not convinced that the &quot;D&quot; is evident enough. You might need to somehow connect the &quot;D's&quot; stem to the &quot;+&quot; symbol or some other alternative. To simplify the logo you could consider separating the elements of the logo and creating a style/usage guide to control their application. For example, the circular mark is either first read (usually top right) or it is incorporated into the primary graphic design (as in your poster) and the &quot;IFMSA-EMERGENCY &amp; DISASTERS&quot; is a tertiary read via positioning or size relative to the circular mark. BTW, where does 3M come into the picture? Are they the primary sponser? <BR> <BR>RE: Poster (only read this if you care to read my take on it as a communicator) <BR> <BR>&quot;BE PART OF US&quot; works great graphically, but it reads funny. Some alternatives might be &quot;Take Part With Us&quot;, &quot;Come Join Us&quot; or just &quot;Join Us&quot;, &quot;Be a Part of It&quot;, etc</div>

		<div class="commentbody">does the IFMSA not have an existing logo and/or is this green bar with the abbrev. it?  <BR> <BR>I ask because your explaination suggests that this ED unit is only 1 particular service or wing of the IFMSA - if so, should your symbol not include the real IFMSA logo so that the symbol your creating here will be the standard for all other dept or service symbols to follow.  - and then with that you may find that its going to get diffucult to design the ED part for units such as (I don't know) Nurses and Surgeons  - NS or Disease &amp; Research - DR. <BR> <BR>I think this might be what is the busy-ing factor - clarifying who the organization is and then what the service is. you have suggested ED twice - written and abbrev. - so this Emergency and Disasters seems to me the organizations primary purpose or even its name. <BR> <BR>I might say to  put emergencies and disasters around the circle and lose the fluff words - that way IFMSA stands alone and so does the circle - but they can be used together on top of each other too. <BR> <BR>or maybe I'm way off - who knows.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christian: <BR> <BR>You've done a really good job applying the recommendations from this critique. You've made some great improvements. <BR> <BR>RE: Logo - I agree with Darrel, that connecting only half of the &quot;D's&quot; stem might keep it from dominating the logo. I suggest using the top half, as the bottom half may look like a backwards &quot;G&quot;. Also, the &quot;+&quot; looks centered. Another way to decrease the dominance of the &quot;D&quot; might be to offset the &quot;+&quot; to the right. Tanya's suggestion about the circling type helped a lot. Much better. <BR> <BR>RE: Poster - I'm not sure that you have enough word spacing between &quot;BE&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;PART&quot;, and then &quot;OF&quot; and &quot;IT&quot;. The space between &quot;PART&quot; and &quot;OF&quot; seems OK. The globe &quot;O&quot; works for me. The new logo definitely demands more attention than the globe, but I see a relationship between them that is advantageous. Because of the size and shape relationship between the logo and globe, it communicates to me that the E+D organization is global. I assume this is what you intended, and I think it works. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

I'd shrink him a bit and move him and the green floor up so &quot;3M&quot; has some room. The &quot;BEAPARTOFIT&quot; needs to be taken down in size and spaced out better. Be careful.

		<div class="commentbody">Great job Christian! <BR> <BR>I'm curious why the logo elements are weighted differently from the 3-color logo. In the 3-color logo, the &quot;ED&quot; is clearly the primary read, but in both of the 1-color logos the IFMSA and &quot;+&quot; are the primary elements. For a consistent message, you might try weighting the background circle more heavily, then screening back the IFMSA and &quot;+&quot;. The EMERGENCIES &amp; DISASTERS can probably be black. <BR> <BR>RE: Poster <BR> <BR>I'm still in support of the globe and the doc sillhoette. I support them both for primarily the same reason. The globe assures that you are communicating a global aid organization, which is a cool thing to be a part of. The doc might look a little intimidating, but to me, it's almost like looking at a superhero</div>
