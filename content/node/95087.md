  body: If you already have FontLab Studio 5.1.x installed, you should be good to
    go. If you don't, make sure it is installed before you do the upgrade to Mountain
    Lion, otherwise it won't let you install it under Apple's new code signing rules.
    FontLab Studio works just fine under Lion and Mountain Lion.

  body: AFAIK you can still run unsigned installers and apps in 10.8 by going into
    System Preferences and changing the Security setting "Allow applications downloaded
    from" to "Anywhere".

  body: Rachel, I had the same problem when I first loaded Lion.  Eventually, with
    help from others, I also reinstalled Robofab and have been fine ever since.  Did
    you upgrade from Lion to Mountain Lion or from an older OS?
