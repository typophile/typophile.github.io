<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
Letter identification is a critical front end of the reading process. In general, conceptualizations of the identification process have emphasized arbitrary sets of distinctive features. However, a richer view of letter processing incorporates principles from the field of type design, including an emphasis on uniformities across letters within a font. The importance of uniformities is supported by a small body of research indicating that consistency of font increases letter identification efficiency. We review design concepts and the relevant literature, with the goal of stimulating further thinking about letter processing during reading.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Dean. In my Beatrice Warde Memorial Lecture at St Brides a couple of years ago, I looked at &lsquo;the importance of uniformities&rsquo;, specifically with regard to spatial frequency, and suggested that the work of type design can be conceptually understood as &lsquo;manipulating relationships of sameness and difference&rsquo;. I propose that most of the differences are &lsquo;given&rsquo; in one way or another &ndash; the necessary differences between individual signs that permit us to distinguish them, the differences between styles and weights, the differences between scripts &ndash; and hence that on balance we are mostly involved in ‘making same’ shapes with given differences, although there are specific instances of making different shapes that have built-in similarities.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can&rsquo;t believe I missed this when Christopher posted it six-and-a-half months ago.</p>
<p>I think Thomas Sanocki and Mary Dyson are right in wanting to stimulate thinking about the critical front end of the reading process and in relating current work in different research paradigms to principles from the field of type design. Good examples are the discussion of Denis Pelli and his associates’ work on crowding and efficiency, the review of Peter Walker and Sanocki’s work on font tuning and font-specific schematic tuning, the referencing of Fiset, Blais, Arguin and Gosselin, et. al.’s work with classification images, and the section on the microgenesis in the time dimension of letter or word processing.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s an excellent paper, despite the fact that I think it&rsquo;s major premise, that letter identification is a critical front end of the reading process, ultimately hinders access to a potentially even richer type-friendly view and partially pre-empts the paper’s stated goal of stimulating further thinking.</p>
<p>The paper states, “It is now clear that letter perception provides a critical front end for reading because letters are functional units — they are independent pieces of the word code,&quot; and references McClelland, 1976, Oden, 1984, Pelli, Farell, &amp; Moore, 2003. All these authors clearly share the paper’s perspective, yet Denis Pelli, Bart Farell, and Catherine Moore’s central claim in ”The remarkable inefficiency of word recognition” and other papers is that the efficiency of word recognition is only what one would expect if information at the granularity of independant strokes were the pivotal functional units, and Jay McClelland, one of the authors of the interactive activation account has consistently held that, though the interactive activation scheme uses letters, this standard cognitive unit might not necessarily have to be reified in a model to make it work, as shown by the explanatory power of what he calls intrinsic integration models. (I&rsquo;m not familiar enough with the work of Gregg Oden to comment on his approach.)</p>
