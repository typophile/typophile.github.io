  body: Tina, <BR> <BR>If you are speaking about FontLab then you can create new glyphs
    just by double-clicking the empty grey cells in the font window. Or select grey
    cells and choose the Reset command in the Glyph menu. <BR> <BR>Johnych

  body: Tina - <BR> <BR>Seeing as you mention 400 glyphs, I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re
    adding <BR>around 150 new glyphs that don&#39;t  currently exist in the file.  <BR>
    <BR>The easiest way to accomplish this is by pasting empty <BR>glyph cells from
    another font. After activating, selecting and copying them, <BR>append the glyphs
    to your desired font by right clicking and selecting <BR>&#34;Append&#34;. This
    will add the empty cells to your font. You will <BR>then need to name them appropriately.

  body: The best method is to use FontLab&#39;s &#39;Generate Glyphs&#39; function.
    You can paste a list of glyph names into the Generate Glyphs dialogue panel, and
    these will be added to the font as blank glyphs. <BR> <BR>If you simply want to
    create empty cells into which to add new glyphs, you can create/edit the .enc
    file for the font, which is stored in the FontLab/Encoding folder.
