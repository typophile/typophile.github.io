  body: "The top samples look like Chaim Shamen, with some Ahoni aspects. \r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    except for the second design, the designs are effective.\r\n\r\nAnother great
    design of Hebrew wood type was Yitchak Ginsbourg. Unfortunately, none of his designs
    were preserved.\r\n\r\nA great collection of Hebrew wood designs were in the pocession
    of Lili Wonker, of New York. About 18 years ago, I learned about the collection
    from Ari Davidow, who visited her. She was an old lady then; so I don't know if
    she is deceased or in old age home."
