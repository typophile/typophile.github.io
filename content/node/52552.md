  everyones adding strokes and filling the same font or this must be available somewhere..can
  you help me out?\r\n\r\nbtw, ive looked at the fat font fad list and nothing comes
  close (except maybe pump which does have a completely different J)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/839231223907975_4890.jpg]"
