  this card and thought I&#39;d post it here. The Arabic bit is a Sufi poem, the client
  is Iranian, and the market is &#34;resistance fashion&#34;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13870.jpg"

  body: Kind of bold for an Arabic company to call itself Asasin, isn&#39;t it?  Even
    if it&#39;s not meant to be assassin, people are going to see it, and the red
    and black on the card with Arabic writing...  I hope they know what they&#39;re
    getting into. <BR> <BR>From a an aesthetic standpoint however, I like the design.  Especially
    the calligraphy over the woman&#39;s face.  It has a really interesting texture
    to it and good contrast.  What font did you use for the asasin.org?  Looks like
    Filosophia?

  body: Paul, I like it. Just the stars don&#39;t work - try to find another ornament,
    something more organic. And I&#39;m not sure about that Bodoni. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    you&#39;re lucky to have such a juicy client! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: The client&#39;s first name is &#34;Asa&#34;, so her company name is kind
    of a play on words. Plus, I gather that the assassin &#40;in its historical meaning&#41;
    has much the same mystique in Iranian culture as the ninja in Japan, or the cowboy
    in America. <BR> <BR>Yeah, that&#39;s Filosofia, which I think provides an interesting
    contrast here even though I don&#39;t usually like Bodonis. The other text is
    Alpha Headline, gruff and no-nonsense. <BR> <BR>Paul

  body: 'Are Soofis Shee&#39;a? If not, the connection you&#39;re making might be
    shaky, since Iran is basically Shee&#39;a. Plus there&#39;s an issue of calligraphic
    culture/style: Arabic versus Persian - but I don&#39;t know enough about that
    to say. <BR> <BR>BTW, in Arabic &#34;asaaseen&#34; is the plural of something.
    If it&#39;s the plural of &#60;&#60;&#39;asaas&#62;&#62;, I don&#39;t know what
    that means, but if its the plural of &#34;qasaas&#34;, then that means &#34;somebody
    who cuts&#34;, like maybe throats... So the English word might very well be coming
    from the Arabic! Consider incorprating a knife - maybe an assassin&#39;s knife,
    which has a wavy blade. Or maybe not.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62; mystique <BR> <BR>And
    don&#39;t forget James Bond, the most glorified assassin anywhere! <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: "According to dictionary.com: <BR> <BR>&#34;At first glance, one would be
    hard-pressed to find a link between pleasure and the acts of assassins. Such was
    not the case, however, with those who gave us the word assassin. They were members
    of a secret Islamic order originating in the 11th century who believed it was
    a religious duty to harass and murder their enemies. The most important members
    of the order were those who actually did the killing. Having been promised paradise
    in return for dying in action, the killers, it is said, were made to yearn for
    paradise by being given a life of pleasure that included the use of hashish. From
    this came the name for the secret order as a whole, an, \u201Chashish users.\u201D
    After passing through French or Italian, the word came into English and is recorded
    in 1603 with reference to the Muslim Assassins.&#34; <BR> <BR>For whatever that&#39;s
    worth."

    again, and not think he is an al-qaeuda &#40;or however it is spelled&#41; member.
    The info asa gives through her manifesto is all true, and taken as true not only
    in the arabic world, but also in europe and usa &#40;by those who care about finding
    the info anyway&#41;. Watch michael moore&#39;s &#34;bowling for columbine&#34;
    or read one of noam chomsky&#39;s books about politics. <BR> <BR>as for the card,
    i agree that the five pointed star is not relevant to arabic culture, it&#39;s
    much more westernized... why dont you look at <a href="http://www.symbols.com"
    target="_blank">www.symbols.com</a> or some books about traditional arabic architecture/ornaments?
    <BR> <BR>erm, i just noticed... is it just me, or is she really asking for $1200
