  body: Since the booklet is about Haneke, I would recommend choosing as neutral a
    typeface as you can find. The thing about his films is that they're clinical and
    distances, which is what gives them their creepiness. I think any of the faces
    thus far suggested are too overt. I know you said subtle in your original post,
    but I think even subtle is too far. Non-existent is what would be best.

    is a very clinical exposition of the premise \"monoline + unicase\".\r\nThe premise
    may be overt, but then, so are Haneke's."

    but some of his other 'eccentric' work might be interpreted as subtly creepy.

  body: "To make something subtly creepy, what I think of is to take something very
    normal and familiar, and put it slightly off. A haphazard mixture of letters from
    two very similar fonts, like Helvetica and Akzidenz Grotesk, for example, tracked
    widely but slightly unevenly. Just enough that people like us would notice. The
    average reader would be able to feel that there is something wrong with what they're
    seeing, but wouldn't be able to identify exactly what.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Jason, cool idea. That could connect to Haneke's somewhat subversive creepiness
    in using the (= his) medium. Like the way he mixed film & video aesthetic in <em>Cach\xE9:</em>
    I watched that with a friend who doesn't know much about movies, and she commented
    later that it took her a while to realize it was that slight difference in image
    quality/feel that did a lot to subtly unsettle her. \r\nDunno if Helvetica/AG
    isn't too subtle though for \"normal people\" to notice?\r\n\r\nAlternately, his
    work seems to be a lot about voyeurism and the role of the audience, who is never
    passive but always, if subliminally, part of the story. \r\nI wonder if/how this
    notion of \"drawing in\" viewers/readers and making them participate could be
    translated into a typographic treatment that still works."

    said, that particular mix might wind up looking like Arial. Other font pairs probably
    would be more effective. Matching weights of Futura and Avant Garde, maybe, or
    whatever."

  body: "what a great discussion! seriously! i appreciate the depth of thinking between
    the design and the psychological content of the films.\r\n\r\ni'm making this
    for our local independent cinema, so we've this balance to strike between being
    the indie-interesting-accessible film theatre and pleasing the much more conservative
    university that's co-funding the booklet. i'm worried that just setting helvetica/AG
    may confuse most of the readership (just it's a great in-joke). we're still talking
    chilling horror films, so i chose to hit them over the head a little bit for the
    sake of impact and went with Keedy. Crazy - but I feel it works...! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/haneke_5097.jpg]"

  body: Speaking of which, the poster for Funny Games features a very standard looking
    sans serif (might even be the unkerned Arial:P) Looking at the picture above though,
    I think you've made a decent choice, quirky enough to hint at the content later,
    but fairly easy to read and NOT(very important) in your face.
