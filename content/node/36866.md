    (in Photoshop) to achieve the effect you're looking for.\r\nDon't know in AI,
    maybe you have to rasterize it, but then it's not editable anymore."

    how much IE really sucks.) I've noticed this effect and was wondering what was
    going on. How do I activate clear type in Windows?"

  body: "\"How do I activate clear type in Windows?\"\r\nBlueStreak, you didn't mention
    which version of Windows you use, so I'm assuming it's XP. (in Vista Cleartype
    is on by default.) See this page on how to turn on CT in XP:\r\n[[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=2241]]\r\n\r\nalso
    this page:\r\n[[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/tune.aspx]]\r\nshows
    how to use the ClearType tuner, but you must do it using IE.\r\n\r\nJason C\r\n"

  body: Thanks Jason C. Learning to work in Windows after 20+ years of using a Mac
    reminds me of the awkward switch from PageMaker to Quark. Switching the display
    to ClearType is one more baby step that I've made.

  body: "<cite>Is there any way I can type the \u2019pixelized\u2019 version of verdana?</cite>\r\n\r\nIn
    a Windows environment without Cleartype, fonts are designed to fit the pixel grid
    at small sizes. This makes the text much easier to read. The font contains special
    guides known as \"hints\", which distort the fonts slightly, but keep the letterforms
    intact when they are only a few pixels wide. On the web, the rendering of basic
    text is handled by the browser, so that same sample may look different depending
    on what OS/browser combination you're using. \r\n\r\nIf the above sample was actually
    a bitmap in the webpage, then it might have been created with one of the previously
    suggested techniques. Alternatively, there may be an actual pixel font floating
    around somewhere that duplicates this effect. At very small sizes there are fewer
    pixels to turn off and on, which makes originality a challenge. If you're looking
    for pixel fonts, you might want to check out [[http://www.fontsforflash.com/|Fonts
    for Flash]].\r\n\r\nAlso, if you clarify your intended use, you might get better
    suggestions."
