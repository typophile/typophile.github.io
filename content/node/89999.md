  people can use a typeface like this one.\r\n\r\nLetters that I am happy with: r,
  y, t, z.\r\n\r\nLetters that I am NOT happy with: k, s.\r\n\r\nYou?"

  body: "Nice looking 'z' with the ink traps. Pretty cool typeface as well. It has
    a bit of the appearance of a blackletter yet it's much more soft and friendly.\r\n\r\n-
    /w/ is a bit too wide.\r\n- /s/ is too light.\r\n- The bottom side of /e/ (does
    this part have a name?) should be a bit more extended to the right I think.\r\n-
    I'm not sure what the /k/ needs but the current design indeed looks weird due
    to the serif on the leg which extends the length.\r\n- /d/ has a bit too much
    contrast compared to letters like /n/ and /e/. Actually, I see the same with /p/,
    /q/ and /a/ so you might want to increase the contrast in /e/ and /n/ instead
    of decrease the contrast in the other letters.\r\n\r\nBy the way, as far as I'm
    concerned you can post as much as you like. I was actually disappointed to see
    there hasn't been much activity on Typophile in the last few days and also not
    a lot of new typeface entries."

  body: "I will go, point by point.\r\n\r\n/e/... looks better like that.\r\n\r\n/k/...
    I think it needs to be more like handwritten. I will work on it. This one was
    just demo.\r\n\r\n/e/ and /n/... I agree on the /e/, the middle stroke should
    be thinner, like in the /a/. /n/ though is directly copied from /d/, so the difference
    must come from some optical illusion, with which I am not familiar with.\r\n\r\nWhere
    do you see blackletter in this design?"

  body: "> Where do you see blackletter in this design?\r\nIt's quite a bold face
    to begin with, but the one-directional base stems remind me a lot of the blackletter
    form. Also, the severe slant towards the stems."

    width=\"500px\">\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nCapital letters (which have more serifs than
    the lowercase).\r\nMost letters have nearly the same width.\r\nThe basic shape
    of b d p q g etc. looks more like it is hand drawn (a little dilemma here, because
    I actually liked the previous shape too.)\r\nI added some more \"inktraps\" (not
    sure if this term is correct) \r\nNew \"k\".\r\n\r\nStill a lot of work.\r\n\r\nI
    am thinking that I should use less straight lines."
