body: "This family was inspired by a Type Battle here at Typophile: How would you
  design a font metrically compatible with Helvetica, but better than Arial? Working
  with preset letter widths was an interesting constraint, both a relief and a limitation
  at the same time.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-Familiar_Pro_450_4770.gif]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI
  have done all the 4 basic weights, and the skewed obliques (done to a slightly less
  steep 10 degrees angle as opposed to the originals 12) has been optically adjusted.
  The letters have been designed quite close to the german/swiss grotesk tradition,
  but by using super-elliptical rounds, rounded dots and slightly curved outer diagonals
  the end result is a friendly looking font family that still looks... familiar.\r\nhttp://www.cheapprofonts.com/Familiar_Pro\r\n\r\nPlease

  body: "Heldustry looks a bit... familiar, too - but it is still quite cold. I didn't
    even know such a font existed. Fun idea, though - but IMO it ended up too close
    to Helvetica and not much like Eurostile at all... ;)\r\n\r\nMy aim with Familiar
    Pro was to make a softer and friendlier \"replacement\" font by gently squeezing
    the round shapes (like with a soft ball) and also the diagonal letters (like they
    were squished from the top and bulged out). Some different lettershapes and the
    rounded dots completes the friendlyness :)\r\n\r\nUmm... Nightmares?"

    they had it coming. As you said, it's one stone cold sumbee.

    dog-flavored fonts! Brilliant, and the best of luck with this. And we should keep
    going. Times is next of course!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
