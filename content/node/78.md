    particular newspaper/magazine?

    Highsmith did recently design the new body face for the El Universal newspaper
    &#40;of Mexico City&#41;, and it has some similarities. Here&#39;s a sample of
    some titling: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/universal.gif"

    Formula, doesn&#39;t it?

  body: Prensa figured in the redesign of <i>Inc.</i> magazine back in October 2001.
    Cyrus showed me samples at TypeCon that summer. I don&#39;t recall if he said
    he designed it specifically for them or not. I suspect that the sketches for the
    design started as a personal exploration, but then <i>Inc.</i> commissioned the
    completion and licensed exclusivity for the past year and a half. But that&#39;s
    pure speculation on my part. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>

  body: '&#62; there is a &#34;trend&#34; <BR> <BR>There very much is, yes. And it&#39;s
    broader than just resurrecting Dwiggins&#39;s angularity. I call it the &#34;fauve&#34;
    style, and one of its strongest constituents is the recent -or recently revived-
    Eastern European school of type design. <BR> <BR>It seems to be somewhat of a
    reaction to the clean-cut Dutch style that has dominated the &#34;serious&#34;
    font scene in the past decade or two &#40;as opposed to the &#34;frivolous&#34;
    scene coming from NoCal&#41;. Some would call it Baroque. But essentially it seems
    to tap into the less controlled, the warm fuzzy side of shapes. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    It&#39;s beautiful. <BR> <BR>Which however is exactly the problem with using it
    for news - as you can see from that particular &#40;and actual&#41; setting. To
    me a certain neutral, maybe even austere atmosphere is the main requirement for
    news setting - especially titling, especially in this Age of War. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: What you mean by serious and frivolous, please give example, to understand
    to what you refer? <BR> <BR>Neutral and austere are very subjective, nobody see
    same things.

  body: 'Language is always a little fuzzy - some words especially. But humans use
    language because it&#39;s useful! The word &#34;neutral&#34; for example does
    mean different things to different people, but certainly more people would agree
    that Minion is more neutral than Lexicon for example - it&#39;s a useful distinction.
    <BR> <BR>Although nothing exists in a pure state, to me there are two opposing
    forces here, based on design intention: on one side we have self-expression, doing
    it because &#34;it&#39;s cool&#34; etc., and this is typified by the Emigre school;
    on the other hand we have the more populist desire to serve <i>other</i> people,
    more typical of European design. And this is a cultural difference that pervades
    everything, not just design. <BR> <BR>As examples I might give Suburban and Fedra-Serif.
    But sometimes the two poles appear in strange places. Seria for example has a
    serious Roman but a frivolous Italic. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
