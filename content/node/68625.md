    on what? Have you seen other letters?\r\nThe differencies between O and o indicate
    at least some big problem in reproduction.\r\nThus making it difficult to find
    out the original typeface, if any exists."

  body: "Ok, first, you're right, good point. Thank you. \r\nSecond, I should have
    been more clear. It's probably a mish-mash of a few typefaces (2 or 3). It'd be
    fantastic to find a g quite similar (closer than Hoefler, closer than Belwe and
    closer than Plantagenet Cherokee) and an r quite similar. \r\nThird, there should
    be no room for arrogance or sarcasm on this forum, and users should not tolerate
    it. It tends to run rampant on here, and in the design community. \r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your response. I appreciate it. "

  body: After over 5 years :-) in the lettering field I can say it is probably hand
    lettered. If you look carefully at it there are too many things wrong with it
    to be type unless it is a reallllllllllly bad free font! And I do not think anybody
    is being rude!

  body: "I must say, the awful lettering of \"Oregon\" on the license plates is one
    of the things that bothered me most about moving to Oregon. Second to leaving
    friends and colleagues behind in Seattle, of course. On the plus side, at least
    a good custom license plate was available (see below)....\r\n\r\nIt really does
    look hand lettered to me, and by an amateur. There are numerous details that suggest
    the  letters were customized to fit together... that \"g\" could interfere with
    adjacent descenders had there been any, the lower serifs on the \"r\" look like
    they were extended to try to fill space. But the weirdest element is the second
    \"o\" which simply doesn't match the weight of the rest.\r\n\r\nIf what you want
    is a vector font that looks as similar as possible, it would probably be easiest
    to just have somebody make one, or a vector logo. It's only six letters!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lic_plate_fonts_600_4397.jpg]"

    I know!) - but for what it''s worth - it looks like a (badly) stylized version

    things that are most distinctive about the lettering are present in Footlight
    MT, and none of the things that are most distinctive about Footlight MT are present
    in that lettering.\r\n\r\nThey have two things in common:\r\n- angle of stress
    (seen in the capital \"O\")\r\n- the lowercase g has a very wide lower counter
    (though quite different from each other in the two designs)\r\n\r\n"
