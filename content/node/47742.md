body: I'm looking for the name of a typeface that was once a link in the "support
  our sponsors" typophile ad spot. It was a marie antoinette style quill pen handwriting
  font with lots of contextual ligatures. I seem to remember it saying "HELLO SARAH"
  or something like that in the ad. Can anyone help me? I'm the victim of a spontaneous
  fruitless obsessions.

  body: Exactly the one! Can't believe I was searching for "Hello Sarah" the whole
    time, and it was hiding in plain sight!
