  for a religious organisation and I'm anticipating wanting to tweak exisiting typeface
  forms in illustrator to make something a bit special. I'm just wondering if this
  is a non-issue in terms of licensing, copyright and so on. What are my obligations
  if any? What do other people do in this situation? what do i need to know? any help
  would be greatly appreciated,\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nNick"
