  body: "Sorry Tamas, but besides the fact that it's a blackletter, Linotext isn't
    even close.  When Zeno333 posted his question this morning, I looked at about
    75 different blackletter fonts but couldn't find a match. Couldn't even find one
    instance close to that particular 'Y'.\r\n\r\n - HerbVB"
