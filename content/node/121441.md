  Does anyone know if this is custom design for the airline, or does it use an existing
  typeface?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ANACargo_3811.jpg]"

    Next Pro Heavy Italic isn\u2019t bad for those letters either (actually better

    it is custom, with an assist from one of these typefaces...."
