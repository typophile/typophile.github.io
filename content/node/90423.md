  body: "this looks like a real print of a dot-matrix printer\r\n(if you take a close
    look at the /Es, /Ms, /Ss they are all different)\r\n\r\nYou can use a font called
    <strong>Datmatrix</strong> by Stewart Dean, 1996.\r\nIt's not a perfect match,
    but you can achieve -more or less- the same effect .\r\nThe font copyright says:\r\n\"This
    font is share ware. For payment details see:  http://www.foresight.co.uk/stewart\"\r\nbut
    unfortunately the site is down (or does not exist anymore)..."
