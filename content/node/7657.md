body: 'a swedish colleague of mine recently purchased an opentype font. he&#39;s running
  windows NT. he wants to access things like the alternative figure styles.  <BR>
  <BR>some of his applications support unicode but not opentype layout features, so
  i advised him to insert the desired glyphs through character map. <BR> <BR>trouble
  is, his character map seems different to mine, and only seems to support the first
  255 characters &#40;ascii?&#41; <BR> <BR>here&#39;s a screenshot of his charmap:

  <BR>here, for comparison, is my charmap, offering the full range of glyphs in the
  font: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/53420.gif" alt="british">
  <BR> <BR>any ideas would be greatly appreciated. thanks, geraint'

  body: IIRC, NT supports Unicode. However, the CharMap utility may be a bit different.
    It may be that the NT CharMap only views specific Unicode ranges one at a time,
    instead of being able to browse through all of Unicode. That might also make it
    hard to get to private use codepoints or other odd things. <BR> <BR>Your friend
    should poke about for an option like the &#34;advanced view&#34; that enables
    full Unicode browsing in the Win 2000 and later CharMaps. <BR> <BR>T

  body: 1. With Character Map, one is only able to access the alternate characters
    if they are encoded in the Private Use Area. While the Calaxie Polaris font &#40;by
    Thirstype&#41; supports this, not all OpenType fonts support PUA because, in a
    way, it is a sort of a &#34;hack&#34;.  <BR> <BR>2. While the Windows NT character
    map looks different, it supports Unicode ranges -- just like the Windows XP character
    map. In the Windows NT character map, the Unicode ranges are shown in the list
    that in the Swedish version is labeled &#34;Delm

    the ranges, including the all-important private use area <BR> <BR>incidentally
    adam, you say &#39;hack&#39;, but is there any other way to encode multiple glyphs
    &#40;eg alternates, figure styles&#41;?'

  body: 'Geraint,  <BR> <BR>Encoding alternates &#40;swashes, old-style ligatures,
    small caps, inital versions etc.&#41; or ligatures should be done only through
    advanced typographic layout features. The by far most popular and relevant advanced
    typographic layout system is OpenType Layout.  <BR> <BR>Practically, alternates
    and ligatures should not be encoded via Unicode, but only by associating them
    with the basic glyphs using OpenType Layout features.  <BR> <BR>Assigining PUA
    Unicode indexes are just a hack, its aim is to allow the user to access the alternate
    glyphs in applications that do not support OpenType Layout features. The main
    problem is that glyphs inserted into the text corrupt the text logic: a small
    cap &#34;a&#34; inserted into the text using PUA Unicodes will not be recognized
    by the application&#39;s spell-checker, hyphenation algorithm, or the find-and-replace
    feature. Similarly, copying-and-pasting the text or changing the font will result
    in corrupted text: square boxes instead of the actual letters.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam'
