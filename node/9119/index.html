		<div class="commentbody">I don't know about it being the easy or fast answer. The butterfly idea was chosen over several concepts that weren't shown here. The client liked the idea of the butterfly because it is like a gift, emerging from the cocoon, etc&hellip; It sounds like you are critiquing the second layout with the more &quot;realistic&quot; butterfly&ndash;I did redraw the butterfly in the last item in my post&ndash;I agree that the more realistic butterfly was too easy and much too complicated for a logo, but I think the colour version simplifies and enhances the concept. The wings of the butterfly become bows on the box. <BR> <BR>I'm open to criticism on this, but I'm not sure I understand where you are coming from. Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good point Daniel. I'll have another look at that.  <BR> <BR>I do think that stylistically (is that a word?) that tracking the letters in all caps does help with legibility and it also feels a bit more elegant. It may be possible to make 'on the run' more solid by not letterspacing it. I'll play around with it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the 'butterfly as bow' idea, but the 'on the run' concept is diminished in your newer versions. What if the butterfly was alighting on the upper-left plane of the diamond (box)? So you'd see the 'bow' from the side rather than from above? It would add some action/dynamics to the logo which would conceptually compliment 'on the run' while maintaining the bow thing. You could also add the ribbon cross back on the box. The top-down view reminds me of pinned insects in a museum.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good idea, Chris. Thanks. <BR> <BR>I have played down the 'on the run' part of the identity a bit because it sort of cheapens the feel that we are trying to create for the company. However, it is there in the name, so I should likely do a better job pulling it out.  <BR> <BR>The clientele they are going after is corporate and relatively high end. The on the run part is that they are the only ones in this market to provide a complete online solution for this service.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It might just be me, but I don't think your latest designs say high-end gifts. Overall I get the sense of a quickie-mart. Perhaps because there's a local gas station chain called &quot;on the run&quot; and the rounded corner diamond box reminds me more of a traffic sign than a gift. I think Chris had some very interesting suggestions in his Feb 9th critique. The new placement of the butterfly could help emphasize the &quot;gift emerging&quot; concept that brought in the butterfly symbol in the first place. And I would also suggest looking at different type solutions. The type in your initial posting had a little more of a sophicated feel to it. The sans, although easy and clear to read, in it's current layout (justified, and loosely kerned) just seems stuck on. Would it be possible to intergrate the type and the mark?</div>
