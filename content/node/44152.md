  & offline business marketing and consulting firm.  Soseus is a bastardization of
  \"socius\", which is Latin for \"partner\".\r\n\r\nThey work mainly with medium-sized
  companies who are generally profitable but aren't very <em>interesting</em> (insurance,
  chemicals, etc), and make them so to other businesses and consumers (and a better
  bottom-line) -- by advising on all parts of the brand, everything from how the receptionists
  sound to the marketing collateral to rebuilding their website to be more functional
  towards what their customers want -- and end up being quite integrated with these
  firms along the way.\r\n\r\nI wanted to make a wordmark with a bit of corporate,
  a pinch of design-studio, and a personal touch... and kept coming back to something
  near <a href=\"http://michaeldoret.com/AlphabetSoup/metroscript.html\">metroscript
  by Michael Doret</a>.  Any other thoughts?\r\n\r\nWhat is it you expect if you saw
  this logo on a business card at a tech conference... say CeBit or IEEE?\r\n\r\nAll
  comments accepted and respected, of course!"

  body: "I like this mark a lot, although unfortunately it may be a bit too hip for
    the target audience.  Do you think that insurance company types and chemical engineers
    would be turned on by this?  Read this description of the <a href=\"http://www.personalitypage.com/ISTJ.html\">Meyer-Briggs
    type ISTJ</a> and then reconsider your direction.  Please know I think you've
    done good work, but I have doubts about you connecting with your audience.\r\n\r\n---\r\nNick

    it's working super well at the moment. That said, I think the script can definitely
    work.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul
