body: "I will be in Seattle August 17-23rd. It is a bit short notice & soon after
  Typecon but if anybody is willing I would be happy about it. I am also willing to
  go north to BC for a day if people have time to see me. \r\n\r\nA related question:
  I am keen on looking at contextual letterforms and especially those in Incunabula.
  My quick & dirty searches have not revealed any Libraries in Seattle with stuff
  to dig into. But the chances of my having missed things are pretty high. Maybe there
  is a secret Microsoft or Adobe stash I might get my eyeballs on? What about BC collections?
  I am about to peruse the Typecon Seattle website for suggestions as well.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance & all that sort of thing!\r\n\r\nNext stop SF, CA!"
