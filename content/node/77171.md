    The fact that the trend is going down, in combination with \"economic development\",
    didn't give me the best first impression of the company. Am I missing something?"

    first top on the left because he has a lot of character and it's not DIN:)(I'm
    joking about DIN).\r\nI'm searching other solutions keeping in consideration your
    feedbacks that are really helpful. \r\nCheers, Luca"

    D as they are either stretches to fit the shape of the 'F' or don't really read
    as charts/graphs. in A, I think you could add another bar to the left, the same
    size as the short ones. The tallest bar to the right could also perhaps be shortened
    just a bit to help in reading the graph as an 'F'.\r\n\r\n"

    where? Is \"clever\" a requirement, or rather \"geometric\", \"businesslike\",

    \u2013 you have to look at it for like 10 seconds to recognize the F and the bar
    graph, and nobody looks at a logo for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nIf you can find a simpler
    way to integrate the F with the bar graph, go for it; I suck at it too though

  body: I think the concept is sound, but the execution isn't working. By the time
    this is  made smaller the F is lost entirely. Does the angle of the shadow have
    to be so extreme? Do the bars have to be quite so thin? And does the type have
    to sit so close?

    bar (the one in the back), the shadow appears to extend further to the right at
    that connection on the right side (so it appears that somehow the shadow has a
    wider base than the base of the object creating the shadow--which is impossible).\r\n\r\nFinally,
    I think the whole third bar and shadow are just a touch too narrow."

    close. Also the right hand bar I'd make slightly taller so the negative space
    between the shadows and text is equal. All in all I think you're almost there,
    just push that left-hand bar in a bit, increase the height and width of the right-hand
    bar and you have a very nice logo.\r\n\r\nI also prefer the smaller weight of
    text on the left.\r\n\r\nEvanbrog: I agree, the space around the foot of each
    bar is different where it meets the shadow....though I assumed these were quickly
