body: I asked about modifying typefaces and the legal ramifications of doing so, but
  what about the different versions Garamond for example where there's ITC, Adobe..
  etc. etc. different versions. Can you get special permission to modify and redistribute
  a typeface? is Garamond so old that copyright laws don't apply?

  body: "I think you're kind of conflating typeface (the design) and font (the actual
    working specimen of a typeface). There's different takes of Garamond because different
    designers and entities interpreted a similar \"family\" of typefaces differently.
    Yes, different Garamond fonts are actually based on different typefaces! If you
    had access to some of the original printed material, you too could make your own
    version of Garamond. \r\n\r\nBut you can't take Adobe's Garamond Pro and tweak
    it and sell it as your own (without some special agreement with Adobe) - even
    though Adobe's Garamond Pro is an interpretation of material that's out of copyright
    and in the public domain. In other words, if you draw it yourself - fine. If you
    just use somebody else's font file and just make a few tweaks here and there,
    try to sell it/pass it off as your own, all without having the appropriate okay's
    from the copyright holder of that font-file - heap o' big trouble and pretty unbecoming.
    \r\n\r\nTo stir up the mud some more, some EULA's actually allow you to modify
    the font but only for personal use and never for resale/redistribution. Hope this
    helps."

  body: "definitely helps, thanks bem, so is this only for old typefaces that are
    in public domain? like... <em>hypothetically I'm not planning on actually doing
    this don't freak out on me</em> ...if I got my hands on some printed material
    of 'Gotham bold' and redrew it slightly modified in FontLab.. could I use it then?
    sell it?\r\n\r\n- Scott"

  body: In the US where letter-shapes cannot be copyrighted, yes you could legally
    copy a particular typeface's letter-shapes and use them as your own. Ethically
    or morally though is a whole different question. This may mean you could "legally"
    copy a particular font's letter-shapes and "create" your own font (although some
    would argue that this is not really creating). Again, there is a moral/ethical
    side to the question that should be addressed. In the end, it would be best if
    you drew your shapes from source material that exists in the public domain and
    keep a good record of your process and work. If there is any question, you can
    always point to your documented trail and prove that you did the work and the
    interpretation is yours and thus the font you developed is your own creation.
    Again, not a lawyer, so don't take my ramblings as legal advice. Rather it's just
    an opinion of a fellow typophile.

    stemming from the multiple versions of Garamond. Thanks!\r\n\r\n- Scott"
