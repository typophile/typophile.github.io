<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>When did it first become possible to scale the same fonts used on the page for use in large signs, billboards, etc.? What was the technology behind it? What I am trying to find out is if this was done with photo lettering, or if specialized letters and/or lettering systems were used until the ability to just blow up any text font digitally came along.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Two items to research:
<ol><li>The introduction of photo emulsions for silkscreening (the Wikipedia article on silkscreening says 70 years ago, but you can probably find an exact date); and</li>
<li>The introduction of film-based phototypesetting (late 40s-early 50s).</li></ol>
The combination of these two processes would fit your requirements.

<div class=commentbody>I'm inclined to think the technology may have been even more primitive, using techniques including grid scaling and maybe pantographs, either directly on to a surface to be hand-painted, or on to a large paper to be pounce transferred.
These days all that stuff is done with plotter-cut vinyl or grand-format printers, though for certain special circumstances hand-painting is still used.</div>

Some of these episcopes predate electricity, so I would suspect people have been scaling text for a long time. When I was a kid I used to make posters with an opaque projector in my elementary school. I'm sure I traced text as well as images. </div>

<div class=commentbody>If this helps, I began working in Graphics in a silk screen printing shop in the early '80s. Or main clients were dispaly comapanies, making exhibits for trade shows, Museums, Film companies (props) and ad agencies
We would get artwork from the clients, from which we'd spec type and order it from a typesetting company. They could only go so large by that route. I guess 72 points or so. Not sure what the max size was... Body copy would be well within that range, but not headers and titles. Beyond 72 points, could either be shot in a stat camera (You need a film pos for Screen printing anyways) or (more often, because it made for a faster turn around time) enlarged with a projector on the wall, using the designer's comp, and often, setting the text ourselves using Lettraset. Once traced to size we'd straightened it up on a drafting table or on the wall, and the hand-cut the text in amberlith, from which we could burn the stencil.
We also cut vinyl lettering for one-offs the same way. I have gone as large as 15' tall letters (the logo and name of Commodore 64,) on a banner installed on the top of the CN tower, here in Toronto)
Experienced sign writers, of which there are still a few, just draw the letters from memory. </div>

<div class=commentbody>As I recall, massive letter scaling was pioneered in the 1970s by CTW.
Much effort went into ensuring that the outlines stayed clean.

<div class=commentbody>In his ATypI talk James Mosely mentioned someone projecting enlarged printed pages via lantern during a lecture in the 1800's - I doubt the technology was used to scale type for signage purposes (ie tracing the outlines on a wall and then filling them in) but it would have been possible.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I do wonder how commonplace blowing up small type with optics was at different times. I’m sure that it happened—people built entire rooms for doing paintings that way!—but what’s really important is when it became a common practice. What I’m really after is knowing when designers would have started blowing up type used elsewhere in a campaign/brand/etc. as a normal part of doing business. I think that this is critical to understanding when optical weights for very large signage were being developed alongside text fonts, and how this all fits into the idea of families built with fonts that will remain legible and readable in a variety of circumstances and media.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Si -- I believe it was Sir Emery Walker who showed enlarged lantern slides of 16th-century types in a lecture on printing in 1888 (the event that inspired Morris to create his Golden type).

<div class=commentbody>"When did it first become possible to scale the same fonts used on the page for use in large signs, billboards, etc.?"
When I used film for fonts, we never scaled them — we enlarged or reduced.
Scaling, in my definition does not involve sizing of the contour itself. Font implies that handwork is not involved? The same fonts being used for print and billboard happened in James' talk, did it? Wow!
If you mean fonts, and scale, literally, then Ikarus was the first with a specific application I knew of. ' came out in the late 70's. The font was identical to those used in print and the app allowed corrective manipulation for the angle and distance of the viewer.
"specialized letters and/or lettering systems were used"
The further back you go into large sign painting, the more faded it becomes.;) but there were, as you can still see, all kinds of fonts made for or by, systematic use. The simplest example is the chamfered style, where measurement, marking and painting yielded huge clear letters without a curve, or very few, being required (Herald Gothic is a simple example of this, and Ironmonger a more complex one at http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/fontname). Highway Gothic holds some secrets on this topic as well.
"when designers would have started blowing up type used elsewhere in a campaign/brand/etc. as a normal part of doing business"
Big Cheap printers in the Late 80's early 90's is when that "normally" happened. A lot of wealthy companies did it before that, i.e. large format billboard printing, though specialty companies who did small runs of large pages from plates. I think Coca-Cola had a terrible quality control problem on this, that today looks "charming" to us.
"when optical weights for very large signage were being developed alongside text fonts"
Just now, I mean since the 80's. Before that, the people who made very large signage faces were as different from the text folk as a Formula 1 driver is from a potter, even though they both got their hands on a wheel.
I look fwd to reading what you get.
cheers!</div>
