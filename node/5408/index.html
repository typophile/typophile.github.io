  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">We use a specific dingbat to end articles for our monthly magazine. Ten years ago, when we went digital and purchased Macs, the person who installed the equipment was able, somehow, to digitize the dingbat and create a font. We use Quark to layout the magazine and this font has worked well over the years. <BR>Now, we are going to switch to InDesign and this font is causing major problems. None of Adobe's CS applications will recognize it. Highlighting the typed &quot;B&quot; character and switching to the logo font causes Illustrator to quit; Photoshop reports an error but stays active; and InDesign justs thinks the font is not available even though it shows up in the font listing. BTW, we are using MasterJuggler to manage fonts. <BR>I'm thinking that the dingbat was not properly digitized and hinted and generally, wasn't done right. I now need to find someone who can create a new font for us that will work with our new software. We are in the DC area (northern VA)&ndash;does anyone know of a font design/foundry house that could do this for us? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Kathy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kathy, <BR> <BR>We are the premium font company for dingbats. Not so much the ugly ones but they are easier than the beautiful ones. So either way. <BR> <BR>The question I would have to ask first is this. Are you planning to copy an existing font (dingbat)? That is where intellectual property rights comes into play. <BR> <BR>Dingbats fall into a higher level of copyright protection because they are not a letter of the alphabet. What they are is &quot;artwork&quot;. <BR> <BR>We were ripped off by a very large printer company who made that mistake. They redigitized a font of ornaments claiming we did not have protection because fonts were not protectable. They font out that ornaments are. They sent us $30,000 and stopped using them. <BR> <BR>You can write me a message by clicking on my name. That will take you to an e-mail form. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

It sounds like there is something incomplete about the font file. There may be nothing wrong with the digitization of the artwork itself, but with the settings that are present or not present in the font file. <BR> <BR>By all means seek expert help and pay to have it done if you don't want the technical headache of sorting this out yourself. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Could be a bug of some sort in our applications. But Kathy said it affected all the Creative Suite applications, so it's more than just an InDesign glitch. <BR> <BR>In my experience, these sorts of things are usually font bugs. Overwhelming majority of the time, in fact. Sometimes they are bugs that don't affect other applications because they don't use the fonts in the same way. <BR> <BR>For example, this month I ran into a problem where some Type 1 fonts from a major second-tier font vendor were behaving improperly in the CS apps for a major New York/national paper trying to deploy the Creative Suite. Turned out the problem was that they had messed up in the PostScript FullName, where they had left out the style as part of the name and made the FullName just equal the family name. Turns out that the PostScript spec itself says the style should be part of the FullName, and our apps were relying on it as part of making consistent cross-platform menu names for Type 1 fonts. <BR> <BR>Anyway, just goes to show that there are obscure things about how fonts are supposed to be made, but often these are easy to fix. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all your advice. Thomas, I think my font problem just might be what you mentioned. The font is named AUSA Logo (suitcase) and AUSALog (printer font). In ID, it shows the name just fine but I can't select roman, italic, bold, bold italic, regular or any other style; it's blank. PS and AI don't care so much about that initially but ID sure does seem to. <BR>The dingbat is one that we created&ndash;a little cannon! How cute! So we don't have any copyright or intellectual conflicts, just the font  problem. So, someone who has the proper tools could look at the parts, including the name, and fix it with little or no fuss? <BR>How would I go about finding someone to do this? I'll definitely contact Gerald and see what he says but I could just post here (in this forum or another)? <BR> <BR>Thanks again. <BR>Kathy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kathy, <BR>I got your file just now. Thomas was right when he said: <BR>&quot;&hellip; Turned out the problem was that they had messed up in the PostScript FullName, where they had left out the style as part of the name and made the FullName just equal the family name.&quot; <BR>You had no style name so I fixed it.  I also did a quick clean up of the dingbat which was quite poorly drawn&ndash;probably autotraced with a bazillion points. <BR>However, you said it was a cannon. It is a trumpet or bugle or some kind of horn.  I will send it back to you tonight both as type 1 and OpenType so you can use the Glyph picker in CS. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>
