body: "I am currently replacing the current typeface for a publication that was previously
  using \u201CSwiss\u201D for the body copy. We would like to have a Humanist sans
  family that is large like Aaux Pro http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MzE5
  The reason why we are not using Aaux Pro is because our sister magazine is now using
  it. I did find Joshua Darden\u2019s font Freight Sans to be quite nice as well http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightsans.php
  it just needs the H&JS to be loosend up a bit. If you could give me your opinion
  on these two that would be fantastic. and if you have any suggestions of other fonts
  that would be much appreciated.\r\nThe fonts I was previously looking at were:\r\nAlber\r\nCorisande\r\nDepot\r\nFlama\r\nFF
  Meta\r\nFF Scala Sans\r\nlisboa\r\nMundo Sans\r\nVista Sans\r\nWhitney"

  body: Aaux has a problem with tiny counters in the heavy weights. It looks like
    there was some corners cut in the extrapolation process. For more info, read about
    the <a href="http://vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/Example+About/">improved Apex</a>,
    which might not be a bad alternative itself.
