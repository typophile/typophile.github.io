  body: Hmmm. A larger sample might be helpful. It sort of has a DINEngschrift quality
    to it...but not quite. Someone may be able to identify it by the &#34;M&#34;.

  body: I used the Sans Serif Font ID Guide and found a sample that seems to meet
    the shapes of the M, G and S pretty well. It is FF City Street East Bold. &#40;<a

    shows East Regular, but you could check the FontFonts site to see a better sample
    with more letters.  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s my vote.
