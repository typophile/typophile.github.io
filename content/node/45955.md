  video was filmed in the grounds of Metal Type HQ (OK, my back garden!) and there's
  a chance to see some letterpress equipment and type that I've recently saved from
  the scrap-heap - it's all looking for good homes. Some of the larger items are only
  available for collection from York here in the UK.\r\n\r\nIf there's anything you
  fancy please get in touch.\r\n\r\nClick the link below to take a look:\r\nhttp://www.metaltype.co.uk/rail/clicks/click.php?id=17\r\n\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nMETAL
