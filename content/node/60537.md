  body: The duplicate letters are not the same, so at least this image is not a font,
    it is handwritten.

  body: "I disagree that the duplicated letters are not the same. I think I have seen
    this before, but I cannot think how to categorize it so I can search to find it
    again.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    rotated the black letters so that they could be horizontal: that might be the
    reason they don't look the same.\r\nThanks for the help, Miss Tiffany!\r\nCheers"

  body: "I have searched through some very obscure foundries and other than Slade
    and a font called Harbour, both at T-26, I haven't found much that even reminds
    me of this. Have you considered writing to the company that uses this to see if
    it is custom (or hand-drawn)?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
