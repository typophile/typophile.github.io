  body: "Oops.\r\n\r\nI sometimes wonder if it was better when it would be Courier
    when a font was missing. It was ugly, but had the virtue of making it more obvious
    that something was wrong. (I also realize that a big reason for the substitute
    fonts is to make embedding optional.) :-/"

    got a chance to play with an Iliad reader and the rendering is SWEET, and Iliad
    readers allow one to embed anything in a PDF. I\u2019m already formulating plans
    for an open-source Baskerville for ebooks."
