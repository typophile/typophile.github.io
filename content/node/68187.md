body: "Finally I have decided to publish the fruit of my labour on MyFonts. The result
  for now is yet another version of Baskerville Old Face but with the added suffixes
  \u201DKTKM\u201D and \u201DDisplay\u201D (Baskerville Old Face KTKM-Display). \r\n\r\nI
  wanted to improve the contrast between thick and thin, reduce some ink-traps and
  give stems, serifs and links a smoother overall feel. I have also added some alternative
  letters, ligatures and old style numerals.\r\n\r\nFeedback is highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\nKristian M\xF6ller\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bof_ktkm-art002_6603.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bof_ktkm-art004_3707.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bof_ktkm-art007_6479.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bof_ktkm-art006_5254.png]"
