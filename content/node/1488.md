body: An entertaining font, and refreshing to see something of a slab-serif when most
  bitmaps we see lately are sans.  <BR> <BR>Looking at the word &#34;Pfospfor,&#34;
  it appears to have a jumping rhythm due to the f and p not lining up with the other
  characters. I suppose this feature really stands out because the serifs create such
  horizontal movement. <BR> <BR>Why truncate the ascenders and descenders? Allowing
  them to increase by one pixel will open up the design and allow the p, q, g, f,
  and t to hit their appropriate marks on the baseline and xheight. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  taken the liberty to test it- Here is a comparison... <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/183.gif"
  ALT="font sample"> <BR> <BR>The other challenge here is spacing. Because of the
  variety of shapes, one can&#39;t assume that each character would have one pixel
  of spacing between it and the next. Some characters might require 1 pixel, and others
  wouldn&#39;t require any because of the serifs. <BR> <BR>Where do you see the design
  going? Do you have any other weights or sizes in mind? <BR> <BR>jb

  body: ' Your advice to add a pixel to the ascenders and descenders is helpful. <BR>
    <BR>It seems there are two directions I could take... <BR> <BR>One is to add the
    pixels you prescribe, which adds overall height to the face. Good for readability
    but not always optimal in bitmap font design. <BR> <BR>The alternative would be
    to make the x-height consistent, like you suggest, and eliminate key serifs to
    accommodate the short height. &#40;So, for example, the ascender on the lc f doesn&#39;t
    run into it&#39;s own cross stroke.&#41; <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t even talk to me about
    kerning yet. Heh. <BR> <BR>And weights? I started a 10 point but thought I&#39;d
    hold off until I get the smallest size &#40;7 point&#41; completed since the most
    constraints exist at the smallest sizes... <BR> <BR>//jp '
