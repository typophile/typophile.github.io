  body: If you're on the Windows platform you can activate their Chinese language
    set (under regional settings or something like that--consult the microsoft site
    if you're unsure how to do it), which will give you access to the built-in Simsun
    font (and a couple of others, but I like that one best). Someone who knows Chinese
    can then produce the characters in Word. They can be converted to outlines in
    InDesign or Illustrator.

    am attaching <a href=\"http://www.ezhw.com/ef/chinese.zip\">this EPS</a> using
    one of the fonts that come with Windows; if you need it set in different typeface,
    please contact me through my profile page.\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n\r\n"
