    (1999) freeware font I did which was, in fact, <em>based</em> on \r\nDoyald Young's
    <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?2OZ\" target=\"_blank\">Eclat</a>. However,
    despite some assertions made in the above-referenced thread, the font was completely
    re-drawn, not pirated, and redesigned in some instances (compare the lowercase
    r in the two fonts, for instance)."

  body: "I guess people wondered: why redraw it when it already existed digitally?
    Besides plagiarism, the problem with recreating so closely an existing font and
    releasing it freely is that it can devalue the original designer's work. Free
    fonts will always be distributed widely. The result: How many know about Creampuff?
    How many know about Eclat? Creampuff by a landslide. I don't blame Doyald Young
    for being miffed.\r\n\r\nIt's probably best to contact the artist before you \"correct\"
    his work."

  body: "Just a few minor points...\r\n\r\n1. 1999: one lives and learns. Stephen,
    unless you completely bypassed the \"youthful indiscretions\" stage, lectures
    are perhaps just a tad hypocritical.\r\n \r\n2. At the time of Creampuff's making,
    I was not aware of Eclat being available in digital form: my reference material
    was a Letraset catalog that I had been holding onto for almost 30 years. No point
    piracy -- the font was completely redrawn.\r\n\r\n3. It would be one thing if
    I were selling Creampuff, and thus taking money out of Mr. Young's pocket, but
    this is not the case. And LONG experience has taught me that it is extremely doubtful
    that the existence of Creampuff has cost Mr. Young a single sale: free font addicts
    rarely, if ever, buy ANYTHING.\r\n\r\n4. Are you absolutely certain that Eclat
    is a completely original design, based on nothing that went before?"

    a mistake once you've learned from it. Rather than attempting to justify Creampuff,
    why not chalk it up to youthful indiscretion and say that today you are certainly
    more careful to research the revivals you undertake? Your recent work seems to
    be very responsible."
