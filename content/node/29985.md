  body: According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is finally creating an exclusive all-uppercase
    only rounded sans-serif font as its exact mixture of both "Letraset Frankfurter"
    and "VAG Rounded/Rundschrift"; this exclusive typeface design exactly looks like
    Letraset Frankfurter, but becomes different and appears in VAG Rounded/Rundschrift's
    regular weight.     This font is finally appearing on both premium-quality typeface
    collections from SoftMaker - "infiniType 4" for designers and "MegaFont XXL 3.0"
    for home users - both being released in May 27, 2014.

    behind <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=88\"> Dead History.</a> The
    other half was Centennial.\r\n\r\nI take it you know that the V.A.G. stood for
    Volkswagen Automobile Gessellschaft?"

    for kids in kindergarten through about third grade. I don't know if you could
    get your hands on any of those?

  body: "VAG stands for \"Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft\"\u2026 Aktiengesellschaft,
    or AG, is sort of the German term for a company on the stock market. So, if you
    go back far enough (late 70s? 80s?) you should find VAG Rounded in VW ads or other
    printed material."

    GE Inspira was influenced by VAG Rundschrift. Interesting comparison illustration.
    Might be worth a mention.
