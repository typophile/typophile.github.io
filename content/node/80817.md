body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI'm a experimental film student from Brussels, I like tattoo's
  and I just got my first ink. I don't want any drawings on my body, just fonts. Because
  they are figurative AND the have a direct meaning and message.\r\n\r\nI want to
  put a piece of text on my chest. A fragment of a monologue from \"Mad Men\".\r\n\r\n\"\u03BD\u03BF\u03C3\u03C4\u03B1\u03BB\u03B3\u03AF\u03B1\r\n\r\nit's
  delicate, but potent. \r\nin Greek, \"nostalgia\" literally means \"the pain from
  an old wound.\" \r\nIt's a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone.
  \r\nNostalgia isn't a spaceship, it's a time machine. \r\nIt goes backwards, and
  forwards... \r\nIt takes us to a place where we ache to go again. \r\nIt let's us
  travel the way a child travels - around and around, and back home again. \r\nTo
  a place where we know we are loved.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a piece of text about nostalgia.
  So I want something matchable but not kitschy.\r\nI've been looking for fonts and
  I found some that could work.\r\nNow I want your opinion. (Ps: I like sans serif
  fonts, especialy \"Futura\")\r\n\r\nGreetings and thanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fonts_5546.png]"

  body: Why not Futura?  If I were to choose something to be inked indelibly on my
    body, it would be something timeless.  None of the 'faces you chose have the timeless
    quality of Futura or a Univers or a Trade Gothic.

  body: "There are thousands of tattoos in Helvetica.  \r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/bold-condensed-no-20-63882/|Trade
    Gothic Bold Condensed No. 20]] is very nostalgic of a certain era (the sturdiness
    and lack of pretense of the late 40's, early 50's), and also timeless, as it is
    widely used on the web today.  I would definitely consider that!"
