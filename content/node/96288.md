  body: Sounds probably "lazy" but, part of the (obviously) slight distortion (font
    size choice, post-scaling, bad export, wrong anti-aliasing mode, bad rasterization
    after zooming...), can't see any difference with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/|Helvetica
    Neue]].
