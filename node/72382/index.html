http://gizmodo.com/5590572/windows-phone-7-gallery//gallery/12

Shots of the new Windows Phone 7 in action—with its UI up and running. It appears that the type and copy will be the UI's principle element. I do not know the typeface but it's crisp and warm. ( EDIT: Type appears to be Segoe UI <a "href=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1792">here.</a>

Gizmodo's thoughts on the interface:

<cite> "The Interface
The phrase "authentically digital" makes me want to barf rainbow pixels, but Microsoft's description of the Windows Phone 7 interface is truth: It doesn't try to feel like anything but a flat, digital interface. There is no attempt to depict three dimensionality or any kind of real-world mimesis. No gradients, shadows, gloss or shading. Everything is crisp and flat. Everything pops, bright primary colors and white text on a black landscape. Touch a tile on the main screen, and the interface flies away like exploding puzzle pieces, revealing the app you wanted to see. Oversized text is the order of the day. (Yes, it still runs off the screen in lots of place.) It feels gloriously modern. I love it. I wonder how gracefully it'll age." <cite>

I'd have to agree. A complete breath of fresh air in the age of Web 2.0 iconography. </div>

Hopefully they'll actually release it some day. </div>

Surely that's the opposite of "authentically digital"?
Digital, except in its most primitive bitmapped expression, is by nature mimetic.

And the font appears to be that well-known airport signage face designed in 1968.
Combine that with a minimalist layout and all-lower-case look, and what you have is a retro style, "mid-century modern".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In identifying the fact that practically no one (on Typophile or elsewhere) is calling out what they consider bad typography on devices, I think Joe is onto something. Stewf’s iPad review and a few of Joe’s blogs posts being the notable exceptions. 

I’ve pointed the team to this thread. To their credit I think they’re trying to do something that no one has ever tried before in the smartphone space - building a device UI that relies primarily on typography - without relying on bevels, boxes, fake 3D, Photoshop lens-flares and brushed metal bitmaps used in other devices. Also worth remembering that this is a beta of a v.1 product. 

A bigger question is where are the apps, games and devices that showcase flawless typography. Is anyone making them? I don’t own an iPad, Kindle, Sony Reader, iPhone, Android phone, etc., actually I don’t own any devices (with the exception of a $20 Nokia phone that has one app – the “phone call” app). But I for one would be first in line for a typographically savvy device.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think minimalism is somehow more "flawlessly" typographic than layout styles which use devices such as boxes, rules, and drop shadows. 

When you run text over a disruptive background (e.g. a "screensaver" pattern), then a drop shadow is also typographic: the offset, blur, and density have to be gauged to the type style, colour, and background, for optimum readability. Setting these values is a matter of typographic taste and discrimination, is it not?

The page on the Phone 7 that shows type "surprinting" a photo could do with some drop shadows.

If you have a lot of hierarchical text categories in a layout, boxes and rules are a good way to demarcate information.
By the same token, going the minimalist route does require "white" space.

And in the Phone 7 GUI, that space seems to be latent, scrollably-accessible, in a way that I always associate with early Flash-enabled web pages.

So the question is: how problematic is latent space? 
Have we become used to seeing the picture cropped, and scrolling across it -- especially in map apps -- to the extent that a <em>word</em> which appears cropped and illegible when a page opens, is acceptable? Especially if it is the title of a frequently-visited page. Is becoming familiar with this partial word any different than becoming familiar with an icon -- learning its meaning? If you are going to a page via a link, don't you already know its title?

It's a premise of Donald Norman, the philosopher behind the Mac GUI, that one learns by doing, that an interactive medium is not just information that sits there revealing all without being prodded.

So good luck to those trying to out-Mac the iPhone with a minimalist GUI.

And to those who would judge it by looking at static photos, that's a bit premature, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

It is definitely beta (edit: maybe not "beta" but certainly not ready to be released) software. But, now that I look at the pictures, the cutoff is fine. You need to see video (<a href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-20010780-85.html?tag=TOCmoreStories.0" target="_blank">see here</a>) of how it works. It's zoomed out so you can see multiple lines of text, without cutoff, then when you go into a specific category, as you swipe left and right, there's a parallax effect of the type/content/background, therefore the rest of the type comes into view.</div>

I'm still laughing. After nearly 20 years of using phone devices who's UI's rely exclusively on typography, I'm wondering who would want that. But Wow! look how big the fonts are and thin sans fonts at that! What a truly original design.

I agree. I spend time on the gadget blogs every single day, and not just to hunt down devices using unlicensed versions of our fonts, and I have to agree with you and the bloggers, it's a truly original design - although maybe not everyone's cup of tea.

Only if one assumes that only one direction is correct.

The "gloss & beveled art style" isn't just about 'looking cool' but has deep foundations in human factor/UX design. For instance, when a button is beveled and has a shadow one sees that as being 3 dimensional which offers an affordance to the user that it is a clickable object. This can be an important factor for general usability of the device.

But that's not to say it's the only correct direction. The flat type-centric UI of Win7 mobile may work nicely as well. We'll have to wait and see. </div>

The key here is that most users know what's clickable and what isn't, these days.

I've used the Zune HD (review here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlR3vA7D3rk) and I like the interface a lot. As others have mentioned, some of the type gets cut off, but in using it, it doesn't really bother me. As it's a UI and not a typographic poster, I don't think every instance of type needs to be "perfect."</div>

In fact, I would prefer if most appliances and tools just had one large on/off switch, or a turnable knob, rather than all this programmable BS.
I have an electric space heater that I turn on when the room gets a bit cold, and off when it's warmed up, but I have to press several buttons in the correct sequence to get it to turn on.
I guess you know where I'm coming from:

That'd be nice but in user testing I've seen/been a part of, that's not always true, unfortunately. 

Bottom line, though, we can only judge visual aesthetics of the UI at this point. I think it's unfair to claim it's successful or a failure prior to actually being able to touch the thing and understand the total user interface and experience. </div>

Ignoring the fact that this discussion is about the joy of a typographic UI(who cares?), I think you should really ease up on the untested hate. The UI may be entirely usable, I mean, it is still entirely readable in screenshots.

My point being, aesthetics only matter to a point, and they only please a very small, niche, group of people. What actually matters is the usability. And, pretty can only get you so far.

So, if a word is cutoff, but is readable(1/3 of the last 'e' being hidden doesn't create any mystery for me) then what is the problem?

Also, authentically digital, or whatever the words were, is so purely subjective, it's better if we all just leave that one alone. But I do think the one claiming digital, in its birth, was to imitate life is slightly mislead: Virtual is more of an adjective describing imitation.</div>

I said that "Digital, except in its most primitive bitmapped expression, is by nature mimetic."
In terms of visual appearance (as opposed to functionality), can you name a quality that is not mimetic, in, say, a typeface? 

**

Such things as dimensional buttons are not intended to be <em>trompe l'œil</em> (i.e. virtual).
As Darrel (Aluminum) says, they "offer an affordance" to the user that they are clickable objects. 
The dimensionality is symbolic mimesis within graphic design, not virtual reality within a simulated environment.

Unsophisticated, in the manner that the words are still readable? are understood? or at one point in an active UI, were fully readable? Or how about the fact that the cutoff demonstrates the sort of, massive plane interface that MS has created.

It gives a sort of feeling of exploration, knowing there is this big, connected plane of information and media, and it slides in and out of the viewport.

Truncated text has been used for many years in graphic design(sorry no example as I am lazy). Would it not be better suited to have truncated text in interactive design, where the truncated portion is not lost forever, as apposed to printed?

Nick Shinn:

Do you think there is a point were digital is so understood, or accepted, or a part of ones life that it doesn't need to mimic to offer understandable(predictable) usability, but starts developing it's own traits and patterns?

Broadening the metaphor(away from just type), screen size, is almost a unique feature of the digital world. And even the swipe action(where it produces the same, expected result as an iPhone does). But I suppose that is just functional. And you may have been talking purely on the design.

What about underlined text? It hints at the same reaction that of a button, but does not mimic life.</div>

In terms of appearance, rather than behaviour, digital has ABSOLUTELY NO original visual qualities, so that point will never occur. Bytes are like that.

The "swipe" action (formerly known as "scrolling" isn't uniquely digital: before the invention of the codex (book), documents were in scroll format. In movies, what are pan and zoom if not truncations exposed? In the 19th century, before even the invention of photography, there were scrolling panoramas: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_panorama

In music, it is possible to digitally engineer sounds that no analog instrument could produce, but that is not the case with static visual images.

I once claimed that my Beaufort face, with its asymptotic pointed serifs, demonstrated a unique digital quality of super-sharpness, but was straightened out by Kent Lew, who argued that resolution is a function of output device, and that metal type was far sharper than digital-to-offset.

**

(Blue) underlined text as hyperlink: no, it doesn't look like a button, but there is nothing especially "digital" about underlining a word. It is repurposing, in a similar manner to Ladislaw Sutnar's repurposing of  parentheses to indicate area code, or the use of @ for email addresses, or the > symbol in emails.

Some RGB colors are quite unique, however.

Zune original (the older models) featured this typographic styling (which was around before the iPhone).

And it takes it a step further in making the type a much larger size than usual. The iPhone ads are knocked out sans, but the type isn't oversized at all.

Perhaps current designers don't give it as much thought but just a decade ago, 3D buttons & windows were really cool. Pushing a button in and out of the screen is useful. But there was a wow factor attached to simulated 3D interfaces. Mid 1980's operating systems and devices weren't 3D because they couldn't be. On a Macintosh, there was no gray scale but 3D was indicated with a heavier lines on the bottom and right. There were hacks to make the Amiga Workbench interface look more 3D but it looked pretty lame because the desktop palette was limited.

I ran a hack on my Amiga that would create drop shadows for desktop windows but the drawing was painfully slow. I'm not sure when the Mac went 3D, but Windows 3.1 showed a little gloss. Buttons and windows had a little light and shade. Even though the colors were ugly, back then it looked pretty slick. Functionally, that was as 3D as an interface needs to get. You could tell what's clickable and how windows are overlapping. After Windows XP, the desktop was no longer restricted to the limited Windows default palette. Buttons had (ugly) shading, words had drop shadows and it made older operating systems look flat. Around the same time, the same thing was happening on the Mac with the transition from OS9 to OSX. Drop shadows, realistic textures, all designed to look 3D. While in XP, the effect was so poorly done that it looked unrealistic, in OSX, it looked very realistic. If you've never seen a computer before, you might think windows were suspended above the surface and buttons were shiny glass beads.

If you were to design a semi-flat interface like 0S9 in 2005, it would look old fashioned. The man of 2005 might think the interface wasn't flat on purpose . . . just incapable/cheap. A phone interface with a color screen in 2005 with flat buttons looked lower tech than a phone interface with shiny buttons. If you had millions of colors with work with, you could even make those buttons look like shiny plastic.

That's the state we're still in. If it's not glossy, it's low tech. The glossy interface used on the iPhone is trompe l'œil. Look at the start screen in iOS4. There's a glass shelf on the bottom with shiny plastic buttons suspended on it. The background has raindrops which look 3D. Whether we believe it's really 3D or not is not the point. It's an attempt to fool the eye into thinking that a flat "painting" is three dimensional. The only reason they don't have stuff hanging into the "picture frame" like some of the more clever trompe l'œil, is because they can't yet. If they could make the metal shelf in iOS4 pop right out of the screen, they probably would.
