body: I am a doctoral candiate  at Hong-Ik university, Korea. My interest is a certain
  typographic composition which, assumably, started in the early twenties&#40;1920&#39;s&#41;.
  But it is not easy to find some available references and even know of the accurate
  term for it.  <BR> <BR>Belows are typical samples, which show the certain structure
  that use the same alphabet among two or more words. <BR> <BR>In fact I am in trouble
  because I am planning to set it as a thesis theme. My thesis is about some possibilty
  that this can be adapted to Korean Typography. It has not been considered because
  the Korean, Hangul structure is quie different from the English&#39;s. <BR> <BR>In
  the early stage of my thesis, the terminoloy and references about it is absolutely
  in need. It will be thankful if you give me even a simple comment on it.  <BR> <BR>Bjornz

  body: '&#62;assumably, started in the early twenties <BR> <BR>In a way. Crossword
    puzzles were a huge fad at that time, which is probably related. <BR> <BR>But
    actually, they go right back to ancient Rome: <BR> <BR>SATOR <BR>AREPO <BR>TENET
    <BR>OPERA <BR>ROTAS <BR> <BR>...and have a long cult history. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    recently seen an astonishing Christian &#34;poster&#34; from 1500&#40;?&#41; years
    ago which was composed of a massive grid-field of normal-reading text from which
    various significant diagonal and vertical phrases are highlighted in different
    colours. Unfortunately, I am not the world&#39;s best note-taker, so I can&#39;t
    give you any further information, other than it was in an exhibition at the Fitzwilliam
    Museum in Cambridge about 4 months ago. <BR> <BR>There is also the traditional
    genre of &#34;acrostic&#34; verse, where the Initial character of each line, read
    vertically, spells out a message. <BR> <BR>Check out &#34;The Oxford Book of Word
    Games&#34; and Willard R. Espy, &#34;An Almanac of Words at Play&#34;, to approach
    this phenomenon from the literary angle, which is, I believe, equally, if not
    more relevant than that of design.'

  body: Thank you for your help. <BR> <BR>I guessed it can be considered as &#34;crossword
    puzzle, word game, and word play&#34;. But I meant it was revealed in the 1920&#39;s
    in terms of typography&#40;printed type&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Now I am checking out
    more about your mentioned references. And I&#39;d like you to suggest more relvant
    information in a typograhic way.

    of research on Prof. Michael Twyman&#39;s &#39;Schema for graphic language&#39;,
    as I recall it covers every conceivable form of text layout. He did talk about
    it &#40;most recently perhaps&#41; at the 2002 Thessaloniki conference.   <BR>

  body: 'For those of you who missed my earlier post: <BR> <BR>Traditionally, going
    back centuries, the genre of characters doing double duty in horizontal and vertical
    words is known as &#34;Acrostic&#34;, in poetry. <BR> <BR>Since the 1920s US puzzle
    craze, &#40;still well established  in one&#39;s daily paper&#41;, the common
    usage is &#34;Crossword&#34;. <BR> <BR>No need to reinvent the wheel merely because

  body: Hi NIck, thank you again. <BR> <BR>I know that typography is closely linked
    with poetry, as Lissitzky&#39;s &#34;About Two Square&#34; was kind of a typographic
    interpretation of Russian Futurist poetry.  <BR> <BR>In 1920&#39;s the notion
    of orthogonality was influential. So we can see it at the every&#40;not some&#41;
    other famous graphic work. Muller Brockman&#39;s work is typical case which spreaded
    Swiss international typographic style.  <BR> <BR>I think that your &#34;Acrostic
    &#34; style has played a major role to maximize typographic vision   without help
    of image. So it is ubiquitious. I am focusing that it is a typographic view/phenomenon/principle,
    not merely a word game for no brainer.

  body: Bjornz, I don&#39;t know if there is an existing term for the sorts of thing
    you show in your posted images. You might try the term typogramme, which has links
    to the para-typographical experiments described in Herbert Spencer&#39;s _The
    Liberated Page_ under the term &#39;calligramme&#39; &#40;Guillaume Apolinnaire&#41;

  body: '&#62;I am focusing that it is a typographic view/phenomenon/principle <BR>
    <BR>Yes, this is more apparent with your second set of illustrations, where the
    layouts are driven by Constructivism. <BR> <BR>&#62;Did Lissitzky want to get
    the most out of &#34;Acrostics&#34; to make his monumental work? <BR> <BR>I suspect
    that the acrostic element was serendipitous, and followed from Lissiztky&#39;s
    adherence to his constructivist/suprematist principles. <BR> <BR>If he had set
    out to produce a constuctivist work with plastic elements composed purely of meaningful
    words running up, down, and diagonally, he must have been confronted with the
    problem of what to do at the intersection of perpendiculars: the acrostic would
    have strongly suggested itself to his receptive mind. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;m now
    liking &#34;acrostic&#34; more than &#34;crossword&#34;: -- it sounds more intellectually
    impressive, ennit?'

    serendipitous in making it&#39;s samples with Korean. <BR>Recently my friend showed
    me various sampes which ancient chinese poets did in the similar ways. It was
    gorgeous! As you might know, Chinese itself is very expressive and meaningful.  <BR>
