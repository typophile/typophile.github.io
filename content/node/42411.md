  values for Pantone 186 C, since the Pantone Process Guide is nowhere to be found
  in the studio :-(\r\nYour help is very much appreciated, we're going in print on
  monday morning\u2026\r\n\r\nP.S. Just found C0, M100, Y100, K10 as the appropriate
  value on the web, and could of course make up my own, but my gut feeling tells me
  there's got to be Cyan involved? I want to double check with the Guide as I'm sure
  you'll understand\u2026 Many many thanks in advance.\r\n"

    of yellow and 10% of Black, the result will be closer to red than blue.\r\n\r\nDo
    you have Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator at hand? Or Adobe InDesign, or QuarkXPress?
    Because their color palettes will allow you to select a Pantone color and then
    break it up into CMYK values... And the results will be true blue! (Pardon the
    pun... I couldn't help myself.)"

    a PDF soft copy version of the Bridge. You can find it within the first couple

  body: Many thanks to all of you. Just installed the color bridge libraries. They
    come up with 2/100/82/6. Will again double check tomorrow (in daylight) with general
    4C charts. Thanks again, everybody.

    at convincing the client last minute to just use an additional spot color \u2013
    Pantone 186 C. It's good to know there's a place with a lot of helpful people
    aound like this, in case things get rough. Thank you all."
