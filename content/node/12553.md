body: "Hello Typophiles.  I have a request for some advice.  I'm working on a redesign
  for a website and need advice on some good combinations of fonts to use for headings
  and body styles in my CSS.  \r\n\r\nI have plans to use SIFr for the headings so
  I can use a font that wouldn't normally be on the users computer.  \r\n\r\nI am
  partial to sans serif fonts and really like the heavier weights of ITC Avant Garde
  Gothic for the headings.  However, I am unsure what to use as the body font to go
  along with this.  It would have to be one of the more common ones, Arial, Helvetica,
  Lucida, etc...\r\n\r\nI'm also very open to suggestion for other sans serif font
  combinations that would add a little extra character to the headings especially
  since I will be able to use any font I want (as long as I can afford to pay for
  it).  \r\n\r\nAny ideas/suggestions/advice?\r\n\r\nThanks for bearing with a typographic
  newbie.  \r\n\r\nJamie"
