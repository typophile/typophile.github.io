body: Found this beauty used throughout the 1979 Angus Hall book on The Supernatural
  called Strange Cults. It reminds me of ITC Grouch, but is more condensed and has
  different nuances that I can't put my finger on. Any help would be appreciated!

    Riccione is perhaps based on Modern Times Black by Lettergraphics International
    from 1969, but I might have misread a previous thread http://typophile.com/node/105826

  body: I think it's probably Times Modern because of the time period and a lot of
    similar traits. Cole's article says that TimesModernEF was pulled from the market
    "due to a complaint from Times Newspaper Ltd. who claimed that the name was too
    close to Times Classic and Times Millennium."  Riccione would probably do the
    trick.

  body: "Bob, I agree with your summary. If  a digital TimesModernEF was available
    I would have shown it. Riccione is the second best, but it's available.\r\nDon"
