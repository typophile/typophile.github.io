body: "This is fairly cool. The UI is self-explanatory. However, I wonder if this
  will really make me want to post more to the blog area. Most of the thoughts I have
  which aren't Typophile friendly still don't qualify as Uppercase Blog friendly either.
  And I really don't want to talk about EULAs here too. :^}\n\nThis is cool though.
  I can add the song I'm currently listening to. <strong>The Long Goodbye</strong>
  from the album \u201CA Girl Called Eddy\u201D by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=%22A
