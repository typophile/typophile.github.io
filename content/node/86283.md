body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nCan't seem to find anything that can solve my problem... I've
  generated a couple of fonts now and its a common problem. When I type on any program
  letters with tilde & circunflex accents they get back to de standard font (Myriad)
  and not the font I selected/created. I can select that single word and define the
  font I created, but not if I'm typing. \r\n\r\nI've re-encoded the glyphs, I've
  tried new documents and nothing...\r\n\r\nAny help I would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry
  if my english is too confusing."

  body: "By which keyboard, I mean which keyboard layout. For instance, here is the
    portuguese keyboard layout on the macintosh.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/portugues_5996.jpg]\r\nWhen
    you type the key for the tilde on that keyboard layout, you are asking for the
    character 007E TILDE. On the other hand, if you are using the US extended keyboard
    layout and type alt n to get the tilde, it is 02DC SMALL TILDE that is asked for.
    When the character the keyboard is expecting is missing, then TextEdit or Word
    switch to a fallback font, normally Lucida Grande. "

  body: "I tested what you said, I really have to use ALT+Tilde+a (to get the \xE3
    or \xF5). The normal way would be Tilde+a only and the circumflex would be Shift+Circumflex+a
    on the portuguese keyboard.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to change this?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: The problem was already discussed (but at the moment I'm unable to dig out
    the old thread). I think it had to do with combining diacritical marks vs. precomposed
    glyphs encoding.

  body: 'It then seems that your font contains the glyphs 0x02c6 and 0x02dc but not
    0x005e, 0x007e. Just copy the ones you''ve got where they are missing (in fact,
    you can even put a blank in the missing characters) or redefine your keyboard

  body: "ok, resolved.\r\n\r\nseems I was \"blind\", as this font doesn't have to
    many glyphs, asciicircum (005E) and asciitilde (007E) being two of them, I've
    left them empty. This was the cause of the 'error'. \r\n\r\nShould I create all
    glyphs leaving them in \"white\" and empty and not in \"grey\"?\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot again! "

  body: "You are welcome.\r\n\r\nIf you test your font in Indesign or XeTeX, missing
    characters are clearly visible. Else, if you want to see clearly that a character
    is not defined when displaying some text in TextEdit or Word or some browser (especially
    if there are just a few characters replaced by the fallback font), then it may
    be useful to put some dummy and clearly visible glyph in the characters you have
    not yet designed. Otherwise, I would personally leave slots in grey except for
    those characters that may serve for \"dead keys\" in keyboard layouts (that are
    displayed in orange in the keyboard viewer). "
