  body: According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is creating their version of "Agraphicus"
    and the typeface itself is being cloned as A750 Deco, again in the same design
    as FontBank's Acropolis & Southern Software's Corruga Display SSi/SSK, except
    that more symbols/punctuation and international characters were added, joining
    numbers and some symbols/punctuation.   Appearing on "MegaFont XXL 3.0" and "infiniType
    4" premium-quality typeface collections - both being released in May 27, 2014.

    that you determination need to make a decision is the volume and fold of your
    brochure. You should forever design your brochure with the size and nature in
    brain, instead of annoying to make bigger or shrink an obtainable design to fit
    explain you desire.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.emanprinting.com/folder-printing/Plastic-Folders.php"

    match up.

  body: That was, predigitally, VGC Agraphicus, but it's been manually condensed.
    Digitally, Fontbank offered it (years ago) as <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/acropolis.htm"
    target="_blank">Acropolis</a>. I don't know if the folks I linked you to (a Xara
    offshoot) really have the rights to the old Fontbank (a defunct company) fonts
    as they claim, but at two dollars, does it really matter much?
