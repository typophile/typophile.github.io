  body: "You should search for <strong>Elefont EF</strong> or <strong>ElefoPEE</strong>
    - (c) 1993 by URW\r\nIt's an all-caps font which is a perfect match to your image.\r\n\r\nThere
    is also <strong>Rhinofon</strong> by Thomas E. Harvey (1992, 1993)\r\nbut the
    capital /P is a bit different: http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/6822\r\n"
