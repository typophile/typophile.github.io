  tribe names Galang & Tadhana.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SurvivorTribesGalangTadhana_4756.jpg]\r\nI
  was only able to find very small images. This is as clear as I can make the letters.
  I had more success with Galan than Tadhana, which has a dark background, which accounts
  for differences in the letters.\r\nDoes anyone have any information on whether Survivor
  used an existing font?\r\nIf there is not a known font, I would be interested to
  see any additional letters.\r\nThanks. \r\nDon"
