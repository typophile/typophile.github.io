body: "Hi Guys. Peace to you all.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to build an OTF fonts with extended
  range beyond standard codepage, some characters have absolutely no place in Unicode.
  When puts them in the Private Use Area (PUA), the font is proven to work well on
  the two platforms, Windows and MAC. But I've read a suggestion that PUA is not recommended.
  Even specifically Microsoft Font Validator gives warning the font has mapping PUA
  \ characters. It seems indicate that, using the PUA could bring problems. This fact
  is a bit confusing. The questions are:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> What kind the problems
  by using PUA and solutions? </li>\r\n<li> If not a PUA, then how to encoding the
  characters which haven't mapped in a codepage? The sample characters which I let
  do not have Unicode is \"germandbls.cap\" (the case-sensitive feature) will being
  \"SS\" (when typed in Indesign).</li>\r\n<li> Still related to (2). I've read other
  threads about the PUA on this site, which says that Adobe itself has to accommodate
  the PUA on certain characters. But of course be understood that the glyph design,
  will continue to grow, such as alternative forms of the characters in the stylistic
  alternate. Adobe OTF feature even register until 20 stylistic (ss01 - SS20). What
  codepage properly for these Glyphs? Here I also encourage the issuance of a design
  standard guidelines for this issue, from the competent institution off course.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance for your enlightenment.\r\nBest Regards\r\nawm"

  body: "The Unicode \"standard\" is nthing more than an inventory. It lists symbols
    that a comity identifies and creates code pages that are supposed to fit all cases.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    there are as many forms for a given sign as there are culture using it. Years
    ago, I had to devise a Baltic character, and they said my ogoneks were not right.
    As it turn out, what I took for an okonek was a \"pauckiuska\", an it looked more
    like a tear than an angular beard.\r\n\r\nThe  adjunction of \"private characters\"
    is good, though, because for the firt time, it allows the creation, of variation
    of a character, witout highjacking another font slot. It also lifts the limit
    of displayable glyphs in a font.\r\n\r\nMore curious is the immplementation, of
    the keyboartd in Mac OS Lion : you press the key, say \"o\". AZ pop up menu appear,
    letting you select the accept you want.No implementation of any kind of WGL4 (which
    was the case in Snow Leopard). Beuh.\r\n\r\nFonts forever\r\n\r\nMichel Bujardet\r\nhttp://www.fontmenu.com"

    by that? There's a word <strong>pauk\u0161\u010Diukas</strong> in Lithuanian but
    it means 'caron'."
