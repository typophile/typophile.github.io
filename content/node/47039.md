  especially with the niche letterpress shops pumping out concert posters for design
  annuals and rediscovery of our classic shops like Hatch.\r\n\r\nThinking about that,
  I realized that most examples of original wood type use that I've seen have been
  predominantly American based. Ryman posters, circus posters, 'wanted' posters, auction
  bills, the western migration bills, etc.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that comes to mind
  off hand might be some of the Bauhaus work later on. "
