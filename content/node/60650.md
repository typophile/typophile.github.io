body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have been working on a website project the last 6 months. Now
  when the release is here, I feel it\xB4s not a day to late to get some input on
  the typographic and visual aspect of it. I feel that this is the right forum for
  it.\r\nI can write a lot about this site... the name and branding, the concept,
  the dynamic layout solution, the typographic presentation, flash vs. non-flash etc.
  But basically it\xB4s about one thing, presenting an overview of relevant news and
  articles, easy and pleasent.\r\n\r\nfeel free to give me some input on the visual
  aspect of this. Especially on the typography.\r\n\r\nhttp://secondsof.com/\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\nPatrik\r\n\r\n(One issue that I am aware of and working on is the file-size/loading...
  this is not becasue of the flash files ;) but of the RSS/atom- feeds size.)"
