body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am little curious about font name string:\r\n\r\n1. Is it possible
  to show font name in local string(e.g. Arabic) in font menu?\r\n\r\n2. Some fonts
  names in font menu in MS. Word has attached local string (\u0627\u0628\u062C\u062F
  \u06BE\u0648\u0632) and some not. Examples are Arabic Transparent and Arial respectively?
  How can I attach this local string to my font?\r\n\r\n3. Is it possible to customize
  this local string (\u0627\u0628\u062C\u062F \u06BE\u0648\u0632)?\r\n\r\n\r\nBest
  regards,\r\nAtif \r\n"

  body: "1. To get localized font name, you should add entry to 'name' table for corresponding
    language. It will be displayed based on system langauge settings. \r\n\r\n2. When
    displaying sample string, Office is first looking at font signature in OS/2 table.
    If it appears to be single-charset font, string for this charset is displayed.
    For other fonts, string is chosen based on current language.\r\n\r\n3. Unfortunately,
    you can't customize this string.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"
