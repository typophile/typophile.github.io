  body: "This is a version of a wooden typeface created by William Hamilton Page in
    the 19th century and now known as Concave Tuscan extra condensed bold with side
    spurs. Wooden Type Fonts has done a digital recreation of the font, without side
    spurs:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/concave-tuscan-x/condensed-bold/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ConcaveTuscanXtrCondBoldWT_4324.jpg]\r\nPresumably
    the embroidering people have their own font.\r\ndon"

    for me (/M centre vertex, median side spurs/thorns, slab...). Here are some I

    particularly the ones like, Boxwood, WinnetkaJNL and CouncilEM which so not show
    up in Tuscan searches.\r\nDon"

  body: "I was going to do a mockup of the words TAEKWONDO but found that it is too
    much of a Frankenfont to make this easy. Some letters have a base design, i.e.
    excluding the horizontal spurs which can be pasted on, that resemble Concave Tuscan:
    T, A, K, W [if apex brought to a point], O and N. Others have a base design, again
    excluding the spurs, that uses slab serifs: E and D. This is almost certainly
    not a revival of any classic font that I have seen.\r\nPerhaps it might be most
    effective to ask the embroidery company about its source for the letters.\r\nDon"

  body: "To test the match of Concave Tuscan Extra Condensed by Wooden Type Fonts,
    I used it to as a base for the letters TA K ONDO, added spurs and did some relatively
    minor tinkering with the outlines. I made D by adding serifs to O.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ConcaveTuscancXCondBldSpursSM_4941.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: Great job, Don! Just found [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dunwich/becker-gothics/concave|Becker
    Gothics Concave DTF]], the closest so far to me. Adding slab serifs on /D, reworking
    /W centre vertex and scaling it horizontally should do the job quite nicely.
