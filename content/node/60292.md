  - it is almost reminds me of a Pirate font, but it has a right side swash on the
  letter A and the serifs are different from most Pirate fonts - so I am not really
  sure if it's one or not.\r\n\r\nAny guesses?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grace_5103.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nkaren\r\n\r\n"

    but it is the same there is on the R and the K. '

    font EULA allows you to do that in Illustrator. With \"Type > Create Outlines\"
    you can get the splines of both an A and a K or an R and then take the swash you
    want from the K or the R and put it on the A.\r\n\r\n"
