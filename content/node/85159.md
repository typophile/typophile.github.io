body: "I am trying to identify this face.  The attached photo is a scanned proof print
  of a foundry type face from the International Printing Museum.  From speaking to
  another docent who had tried to research it the closest he was able to find was
  a face created in germany called Beaton (I believe that was the spelling)  I have
  not been able to find additional information.  We have the font in 3 sizes and in
  the smaller (24pt & 36pt) the font is identical except for two alternate characters
  for K and G.\r\n\r\nI am looking for information regarding the foundry version any
  information would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NSFont_3821.jpg]"

  body: "Thank you JanekZ,  it looks like you are correct although the digital creations
    dont seem to hold a candle to the original cuts.\r\nI was able to find a list
    of variations of beton on identifont http://www.identifont.com/show?145 however
    I still have yet to find mention of this specific cut.  there were many variations
    but Im starting to think that Heinrich Jost may not have dont this one as I can
    not find it listed under his work, it may have been a later addition to his work
    so I am going to keep digging."

  body: My friend was able to find it in McGrew's book, it is called <strong>Beton
    Open</strong>.  It was indeed created by Jost so it seems strange to me that it
    isnt listed on any other web sites with the rest of his work.
