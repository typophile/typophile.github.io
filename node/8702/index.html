And I believe &#40;going from memory here&#41;, red is followed by blue, and then yellow, and then green in language development.  &#40;and then colours like orange, brown, purple, and so on&#41; <BR> <BR>That&#39;s responsible for part of the in-born misconception that yellow is a primary colour. <BR> <BR>Not only &#34;primitive&#34; languages show this phenomenon.  Japanese people still call many green things blue &#40;<i>aoi</i>, and in fact they had no common word for green until Crayola needed one for their green &#40;<i>midori</i>&#41; crayon. <BR> <BR>And in English, we say people have red hair, even when it&#39;s clearly a shade of orange or amber. <BR> <BR>What this has to do with typography, I have no idea. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mary Kay Duggan has written some interesting articles related to the use of the colour red in European manuscripts and early printing. See, for example, her essay on early printed Missals in the journal of the Printing Historical Society No.22 &#40;1993&#41;. She has some beautiful <a href="http://sheetmusic.berkeley.edu/205list.html">images</a> online. <BR> <BR>Of course, the use of red for instructions in the Missale Romanum has given us the word <i>rubric</i>, which in one meaning is a law or unbreakable rule. <BR> <BR>The use of black and red in Ethiopic manuscripts is <i>extremely</i> important. Although an exact parallel cannot be made, one can think of red being used in Ethiopic texts in the same way that italics or smallcaps are used in European typography: as an articulating, semi-semantic element. Arguably, religious texts in the ancient Ge&#39;ez language cannot be correctly written without both red and black.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I couldn&#39;t find my copy of Berlin &amp; Kay last night, but I found a study by Sarah Harkness &#40;&#34;Universal Aspects of Learning Color Codes: A Study in Two Cultures&#34; from &#40;I think&#41; an early 70s issue of <i>Ethos</i>&#41;. <BR> <BR><blockquote>In addition to finding universal focal points, Berlin and Kay also produced a hypothesis based on a survey of color lexicons in 98 languages, as described by the ethnographic literature. They found that th eoccurence of &#34;basic color terms&#34; &#40;which they defined as monolexemic, salient terms of general usage, whose meaning is not contained within any other term&#41; was ordered and predictable. Specifically, <i>which</i> basic color terms a language encoded could be predicted from their number, and the presence of any given color term in a language predicted the presence of certain other terms. They found a total of eleven basic color terms, ordered cross-culturally as follows: [see below]</blockquote> <BR> <BR>Harkness also speculated that the &#34;cognitive ordering of basic color terms...may be found in the shape of the color solid, combined with current knowledge of human color perception.&#34; Basically, red and yellow are more highly saturated than blue and green and, hence, hore highly salient in the mind. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s also a study by Kay &amp; Kempton from the early 80s &#40;sorry, I&#39;m awful with references&#41; in which they determined that linguistic knowledge &#40;e.g., color terms&#41; informed cognitive operations. From George Lakoff&#39;s <i>Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things</i>, University of Chicago Press, 1987: <BR> <BR><blockquote>Beyond confirming one of [Benjamin] Whorf&#39;s claimes, the Kay-Kempton experiment has an additional important consequence. It counters an all-too-common view in cognitive psychology that language plays no cognitive role other than to provide labels for concepts - labels that stand outside of &#34;real cognition.&#34; The Kay-Kempton experiment has shown experimentally, if only for one small case, that language is part of real cognition. this is true not just for grammar, but for the lexicon as well.</blockquote> <BR> <BR>Not so related is the fact that &#34;red&#34; &#40;&#34;rogue,&#34; &#34;rot,&#34; etc.&#41; are derived from the Sanskrit <i>rudhira</i> or &#34;blood.&#34; Perhaps that makes red cognitively more salient in some cultures. <BR> <BR>You might also check out Wilhelm Ostwald&#39;s color model that the de Stijl painters were ever so fond of. Ostwald was a retired chemist who set about attempting to psychologically, as well as physically, quntify color relationships based on geometry. Oddly, though, green outnumbers the primaries in his formulation. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, that&#39;s what I found. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/6407.gif" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christ, sorry for the typos in that last post. I forgot to mention that Berlin and Kay, after <i>Basic Color Terms</i> came out it 1969, set about extending their database of 98 languages. I&#39;m not sure what the count is up to, but I&#39;m pretty sure that all &#40;or <i>almost</i> all&#41; of them conform to the seven level model. It might also be noted that Berlin and Kay aren&#39;t without their detractors. Nor is Benjamin Whorf and his linguistic relativism, for that matter. <BR> <BR>And one more person worth looking into along this same methodology might be Eleanor Rosch. I know she did some work with the Dani culture - who have only <i>two</i> color terms &#40;one for dark/cool and one for light/warm&#41;. <BR> <BR>Nate</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Feel free to tell me to shut up at any time, but I thought of something else on the bus just now. Red seems to be the only basic color term in Berlin &amp; Kay&#39;s model that has a &#34;secondary&#34; term: pink &#40;i.e., light-red&#41;. I remember Jim McCawley bringing this up during my semantics work in grad school, so maybe I&#39;ll look through my old notebooks and see if I can&#39;t find out what he had to say about red and pink. In Spanish, or in some dialects, there&#39;s a word <i>celeste</i> that means &#34;light blue.&#34; Why it doesn&#39;t count as a basic term, I&#39;m not sure. And I also recall hearing &#40;perhaps from Jim&#41; that some Japanese dialects have a word for Wittgenstein&#39;s supposedly absurd &#34;reddish green.&#34; Although this has precious little to do with red.

		<div class="commentbody">Rodolfo, <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have a lot of references on hand re. the use of colour in Ethiopic, but I have certainly seen a lot of examples. As I indicated, pretty much every Ethiopic manuscript was written in both black and red. Here is an image of the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/h-orient_to_rome/images/orient06.jpg">first printed book in Ethiopic</a> and here is the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/h-orient_to_rome/images/orient05.jpg">manuscript on which it was probably based</a>. Note, in the latter, the punctuation marks that include both black and red; these bi-chromatic glyphs are normative for the Ethiopic script. <BR> <BR>By the way, Ethiopic is not an alphabetic script. It derives from the Sabean abjad &#40;consonant alphabet, e.g. Arabic and Hebrew&#41; of Yemen, but developed into a syllabic writing system in which most signs represent a consonant&#43;vowel combination.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Tiffany. Sorry I didn't see your posting of 05-06 above - or was it there? With the bugs to be ironed out, I'm not sure now.

Now I've got two answers: you say  "the new 4— series red. 439? I don’t know the exact number but it is richer than 185/6 and more saturated than 19-" and now "173 or 179." I will working on getting a good red for my book, but right now I'm confused. Also I don't have own the pantone colors, so I will check them elsewhere, and look at all you have mentioned. Your link to 'this sample' just goes to 'typophile.com'. Is this a bug?  </div>

485 is richer by far than 185/186, it is also less pink. 173/179 match, sort of, the red used in the William Morris sample. I assume WM would have wanted to use something as close to vermillion as possible. No? ::shrugs::</div>

Which is actually why barns (being generally large) are painted red.
