<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've been searching the web to find the traditional page order that books used to follow, like having a bastard title page, pre lims etc... but for the life of me I can't find the order. Does anyone know the order of traditional book design or could you please point me in the right direction?
Any help is greatly appreciated.

<div class=commentbody>"Front Matter" in Chapter 1 of the Chicago Manual of Style?
Marjorie Skillin’s <em>Words into Type</em> has the following list for front matter (somewhat abbreviated).
i Bastard title
ii Card page (books by same author), imprimatur, series title, or blank
- Frontispiece (usually unnumbered)
iii Title page
iv Copyright page
v Dedication
vi Blank
vii TOC
viii TOC (continued) or List of illustrations
ix List of illustrations or Acknowledgements
x continued, or blank
xi Editor’s preface
xii continued, or blank
xiii Author’s preface
xiv continued, or blank
xv Foreword or Introduction
xvi continued, or blank
The card page, frontispiece, and copyright page are always on left-handed pages. Other sections appear, or at least begin, on right-handed pages.

<div class=commentbody>We like to call the "bastard title" the half-title. It's more polite.
The copyright traditionally is supposed to go on the back side of the title page (that is, page iv) but it can also be the very last page of the book. It can't go anywhere else as far as I know.
The rules about contents pages and openers always beginning on the recto (right hand page) are pretty loose these days, especially in illustrated book publishing. You can certainly design the table of contents to run across a spread.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks,
I've designed a book within a book, which is to say that I have a larger book that surrounds a smaller book. I've been making a puzzle book using words that end with another word so for example 'Smoking' or 'carriage'.
The second part of the word is set in the inner book with the outer book representing the first part of the word. I've printed the words onto various types of paper to work with layering and seeing other words appear through layers of tracing paper and accetate, thicker card and paper with texture, each paper or print being relevant to the word and it's meaning. It's been a nightmare pagenating (sp?) it all and then I realised I'd forgotten the prelims and so now I'm putting them in.
I only knew the half title page as a bastard title page as that is what I've been taught, half title is much more polite I agree :) </div>

<div class=commentbody>> We like to call the “bastard title” the half-title.
Reminds me of Morison's insistence that one of the reasons JvK's Cancellaresca Bastarda failed in the market was that people were mistakenly pronouncing the "s" in the second word, while it should be silent. As if it were an Argentinian font.
