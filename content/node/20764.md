body: "any recommendations for body/subhead text combo for a corporate brochure.\r\nclient
  supplied a dell brochure for reference and it uses a sans serif for body text,\r\nunfortunately
  the client's brochure has a lot more body text, three full pages at three columns
  each.\r\n\r\nI've tested Myriad for a sans, but then went with a used serif: Minion
  for economical reasons,\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if there's a serif that reflects, corporate
  and technology more than Minion and legible at 8-9 points. I have to use a font
  from bitstream. \r\n\r\nthe brochure is going to internal coporate managers to push
  the companies IT guys, hence technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany suggestions very much
  appreciated from you smart people!\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's a freelance project for an Ad agency that specifically wants to keep
    the budget down, therefore they have enforced usage of Fonts that they have a
    license to use. Unfortunately, Bitstream the ripper is it :(
