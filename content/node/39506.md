  in 2003, Arabetics is best known for producing open, innovative, and inspiring non-traditional
  Arabetic fonts. However, we have almost two decades of experience producing both
  traditional and non-traditional Arabetic fonts. Our passion to preserve the power,
  elegance, and competitiveness of Arabic and other derived scripts, within a dynamic

  to providing original fonts through major font vendors, Arabetics had successfully
  executed several custom designed fonts projects, including both traditional and
  non-traditional designs, and had introduced innovative font related software solutions.
  We work very hard to satisfy our customers' requirements and to make sure that their
  contracted needs are met. Our prices are very competitive and favorable because
  we employ smarter, more efficient approach to Arabetic font design. \r\n\r\nhttp://arabetics.com\r\n"
