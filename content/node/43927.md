body: "Hi, I'm a student working on putting a bunch of portfolio books together for
  the end of the semester. I have to print all my work with my Epson R1400, and I
  have been having trouble finding good paper to print on. The main problems I run
  into are that the paper is not double-sided, it is not made for an inkjet printer,
  or the paper is too thick for pages in a book. I printed one of my books on Ilford
  Galerie Smooth Matte Multi-Use Dual Sided Inkjet Paper... but I can't seem to find
  the paper any larger than 8.5 x 11, which was fine when I was perfect binding, but
  now it is too small.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo... Does anyone know of any good inkjet paper
  to print images on for a book?\r\nAny help would be wonderful. Thanks!"

    Art Duo is .15mil and Photo Duo is .18mil. They come in sizes up to 17x22 inches
    and may come in rolls. You can check out www.itsupplies.com or www.atlex.com.
    You could also check with www.shadesofpaper.com. Any of those vendors are helpful.\r\n\r\nI
    don't really know if these would be too heavy or not but they are nice papers.
    Epson's enhanced matte dual-sided papers are nice too and don't seem overly heavy.
    I don't know about the sizes but it should come on a roll.\r\n\r\nSharon"

    II (it comes in 22 x 30 sheets with side deckles) and it runs through just fine
    on my Epson SPR300, even though it's supposedly \"not recommended.\"\r\n\r\nYou
    might want to find a god art supply store that has packages of paper samples (Talas,
    for example, since it's in Manhattan), buy one, and try running as much as you
    can (and like) through."

  body: Staples 11x17 double-sided matte paper is fabulous for Epson inkjets, and
    cheap, at least for inkjet paper.

    lacking -- sort of the \"it's not good enough to market it with our name and charge
    the big money, but we want to get rid of this stuff\" thinking.\r\n\r\nI've not
    used it, but I know a few folks who have used the Staples printer ink in their
    Epson and who thought the black was fine, but the colours left something to be
    desired."

    paper.\r\n\r\n<cite>\u2026but I know a few folks who have used the Staples printer
    ink in their Epson and who thought the black was fine, but the colours left something
    to be desired.</cite>\r\n\r\nI did a lot of reading before I loaded up my R1800,
    and it seems to be one of those things that varies wildly by model. The newer
    Epson photo printers are much pickier than the old ones. \r\n\r\nKodak is betting
    on a business model that involves selling inkjet printers at a profit and the
    ink at low prices. Unfortunately the quality is not up to professional work, and
    none of the printers handle paper larger than US Letter/A4. \r\n\r\nAnyway, my
    new Epson is already starting to streak, although that might just be because I
    loaded a few sheets backward and need to open the heads back up. But next time
    around I\u2019m going with a Canon."

    better than Staples paper but won't break the bank. It also comes in many sizes
    as well. Use it on our old Epson 1280 without a problem."
