body: "Okay, so I'm revamping this logo a bit and would love some assistance in creating
  a logo that has a bit more of a properly swashing capital letter \"B\".\r\nIt's
  all in illustrator and was began from scratch in 2007. \r\nThere it sat, finished
  enough for production.\r\nYesterday i figured it needed updating.\r\nI've enjoyed
  the changes so far, but the initial swash on the B is bugging me.\r\n\r\nIf you
  have any tips on getting it right, ANY comments would be appreciated.\r\n(I've used
  minimal bezier points forever, so that is my underlying style. Extra points dirty
  up the curves in my humble opinion.)\r\n\r\nInitial design: 2007\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/butter-before_4999.PNG]\r\n\r\nIdea
  going forward (not sold on the HIGH-water \"B\":\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/butter-idea_6318.PNG]\r\n\r\nCompared:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/butter-comp_3677.PNG]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLuke"

    the new r is a little to heavy and/or prominent."

  body: And I think the u is coming too close to the swash. Because I would think
    you'd want the same space relation (white space) as you have with the e. As it
    is now, the white space is more filled in.

  body: "On the whole, I'm a fan of the revision. The new B is classy but the top
    aperture is now possibly a gnats too tight & laterally squashed? R's gone too
    far away from the E - personally I prefer the original R.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe it's
    just me, but the baseline of the 'utte' look like it's rotated clockwise slightly,
    falling away bottom right - the new height of the U now giving me the illusion
    that the E looks lower than the U (and closer to LABEL).\r\n\r\nLove the new roundness
    to the tops of the Ts and U.\r\n\r\nIt's not really any of my business though,
    so make of that what you will, sir."

  body: "Thanks, Tiffany and Richard.\r\n\r\nThe \"r\" is a bit \"out there\". And
    I do prefer the original \"r\".\r\nYes, the top aperture of the \"B\" is squashed.
    Great point. Staring at this for too long. ;)\r\nThe \"u\" is too tall, but it
    filled in the space nicely, despite there being no necessity to do so. Bringing
    it back down in line with the \"e\" is the smart thing to do.\r\nThank you both.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think of the spur? Is it too much? I kind of like  how it safely lines
    up with the second bowl line\u2026"

  body: The spur on the B? Yeah - I love it - it's a keeper. It's stuff like that
    which makes the difference - it's a really delightful, thoughtful detail that
    definitely works. Also, didn't say before, but I really dig the slight rework
    on the E.

  body: "Sorry it's been so long since an update.\r\nThe mark was finished early March
    and here it is, for the record.\r\nShirts, buttons, business cards and other assorted
    items were made for handing out and sharing with friends and interested parties
    at SXSW2010 and was, from what we could tell, a mild success for a logo revision.\r\n\r\nIn
    short:\r\n\r\n# the points were softened and rounded.\r\n# the entire shape rotated
    5\xBA to encourage the old scripty feel of brush (hopefully)\r\n# the spur was
    dropped. too out there.\r\n# the internal letters received a curvy arch treatment,
    hopefully subtle enough not to notice, but it changed, to be sure.\r\n# the leg
    on the \"r\" was tweaked, once to be more geometric, but that wasn't sensible,
    either.\r\n# the \"B\" now intersects itself, but other solutions didn't work
    as well. our self-imposed deadline nixed any more changes on it.\r\n# \"LABEL\"
    was dropped, despite it being a large part of the identity, considering my packaging
    background, it narrowed the identity to that alone and was confusing in other
    usages. Label is still part of the company name, though (which is probably confusing).\r\n\r\nComments
    are still very welcome and appreciated. Thanks everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/butter-logo-brown_6029.png]"

  body: Top drawer stuff - love the finished article. The Butter t-shirts I've seen
    dotted about that there interwebs recently... will they be made available to the
    general public?

    is that the 'e' may need a little more adjustments maybe..."

  body: I agree about adjusting the e also. With the angle of the bottom loop of e
    and the long upstroke to the cursive r its almost like having 2 very thin upstrokes
    mirroring each other near the end. I would try making a regular short loop for
    the e and have the t connect into the base of e just like u to t. It doesn't need
    to look like everything is one continuous line. That would balance it all out
    better as well.
