  body: "Your -2- is wonderful. That ampersand is absolute narcissism ... and I love
    it! The -W- is falling backwards. So is the -s-. So is the -5-, but I think it
    is because you need to extend the bottom exit stroke by one pixel. The -A- seems
    a hair too tricky. The -f- seems too short. \r\n\r\nCan you show us another setting
    of the entire set spaced out a bit more?"

      You were absolutely right about the swashy 'W'; it's much better now. As for
      the 's', the alternatives aren't any better, are they? And is that what you
      had in mind for the '5'? Because I don't think it works. So doesn't the longer
      'f'. Now, what do you mean by <cite>The -A- seems a hair too tricky</cite>?
      As for the spacing, it's either that loose or dense as it was before; I'm not
      sure which one is preferable. What do you say?\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nOri"

      body: Okay, it's now clear to me that the new spacing is better. Thanks again,
        Miss Tiffany!

    (b) better space between lines; (c) an alternative ''s''.'

    body: Thanks, Gregory. As for the ligatures, they're actually useless, but designing
      them was fun. :)
