<em>26. 
In January 2004, Hoefler and HTF's attorney Frank Martinez presented Frere-Jones with a Sale and Assignment of Type Fonts that transferred the Dowry Fonts to HTF. Frere-Jones signed this agreement in March 2004; he was not separately represented by counsel. The sale was for nominal consideration of $10 and Frere-Jones, who had left Font Bureau, moved to New York and actively worked to build HTF, all in reliance on the 50-50 partnership agreement, considered signing the document a ministerial act as part of his performance of the original bargain with Hoefler. </em></div>

Turned out to be a very succesful combination, the company made loads of money, which my partner did not want to share. In an effort to clarify the situation I offered to bill my hours, which was accepted initially. After the first invoice things went really sour and I left and started my own agency. A friend lost and a lesson learned.

We don't know all the ins and outs of this, but I think that the creative input of Tobias merits more than being called ‘employee'.
So I am rooting for him.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Press Release fromH&FJ website: 

considering Tobias Frere Jones "a longtime employee" seems to be the problem

For Immediate Release
17 January 2014
Last week, designer Tobias Frere-Jones, a longtime employee of The Hoefler Type Foundry, Inc. (d/b/a “Hoefler & Frere-Jones”), decided to leave the company. With Tobias’s departure, the company founded by Jonathan Hoefler in 1989 will become known as Hoefler & Co.
Following his departure, Tobias filed a claim against company founder Jonathan Hoefler. Its allegations are not the facts, and they profoundly misrepresent Tobias’s relationship with both the company and Jonathan. Whether as The Hoefler Type Foundry, Hoefler & Frere-Jones, or Hoefler & Co., our company has always been a great place for designers, which is why it’s always been and will continue to be a great place for design.
It goes without saying that all of us are disappointed by Tobias’s actions. The company will vigorously defend itself against these allegations, which are false and without legal merit. In the meantime, we’re all hard at work, continuing to create the kinds of typefaces that designers have come to expect from us for more than 25 years.</div>

As the only publicly traded font company you could look at the Monotype valuation (market cap) vs their revenue and profit and do the math based on a $40M market cap. It probably won't tell you anything but might be a way to pass the time. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Money and equity aside, it seems the height of unfairness that Tobias looses all credit for his superlative work over the last fourteen years, especially the work he brought fait accompli to H&FJ such as Whitney. I know you can’t split the “baby” in a divorce, but Hoefler should not get full credit for some else’s creative work, even if Hoefler considers himself the foundry that commissioned and managed its development/sale. 

As many have said, there is a lot of misinformation and he-said/he-did-not-say in the media; but at least the lawsuit brings light to the situation and voice to Tobias’ perspective rather than having this fade to dark without a sound in Hoefler’s favour.

Regardless of written contractual obligations, it seems pretty clear that Hoefler did promise a partnership and then reneged; and he appears guilt free in that “business” choice.

—

What a crazy contract Tobias signed that prevents someone from working for a competitor for two years! I hope Tobias can release a typeface of his own, as I will do my best to support him. Stay strong; best of luck.
