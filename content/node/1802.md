  body: Dean try DaFonts for a free alternative. I don&#39;t know if they have one
    or not. I have a Mac and thats a font I&#39;d never use. Get your hands on one
    of the indie books and you will find a bunch of nicer faces, plus you&#39;ll be
    supporting alot of the designers who hang out at this site. Dan

    but its for a job, and techno is one of the company&#39;s chosen typefaces. <BR>
