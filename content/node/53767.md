  am capable of better, but this was a learning experience. I am still VERY new to
  Illustrator, and I'm learning shortcuts that will lead to me making things that
  are more complex faster. Practice, practice, practice!\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/stars-and-stripes.jpg\r\n"

    i think overall it looks great but the letters where the white stripes are curved
    seem a little distracting q, c etc. also the curve of the j doesnt seem to be
    consistent with the other letters.\r\nJonny\r\n"
