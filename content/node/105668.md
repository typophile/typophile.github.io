  body: "If you want specimens of old American typefaces, Dan X. Solo's Alphabets
    series, as published by Dover, are a great supplement to the foundry specimen
    books. He started to digitize some of these but the project seems to have ended
    a decade ago. Many font-makers mine his books for alphabets to digitize. There
    is also an online encyclopedia of his Solo Catalog, called the Solopedia,  which
    is an first class finder's guide to digital fonts based on the fonts mentioned
    in the Solo catalog, including digitizations based on other sources. http://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/\r\nDon"

    all the info on Dan and the Admiral specimen. You seem to know quite a bit about
    typography; do you remember how you discovered that, \"that serifs in the 'Latin'
    style were the height of font fashion for the era\"?"

    ---\r\nThe phrase \"the height of font fashion for the era\" refers mainly to
    \"broad pen nib terminals.\" In the sample, note the terminals on the letters
    _E_, _F_, _S_ and _T_, although the comment includes fonts which have both these
    terminals and Latin serifs. Regret any confusion. I probably should have expressed
    the idea more clearly.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks for clarifying. I was just curious how you (or anyone) discovers what
    the fashion in fonts is for an era. I found the book "Graphic Design Before Graphic
    Designers" and found it helpful, and I'm sure there are similar books. Ideally,
    I'd find a list of "most popular fonts" for each decade for, say, the USA. I imagine
    the most accurate approach is to just look at many samples from the period.

  body: "I agree the best way is try and find fonts in use. An academic looking for
    a research project could go though the advertising in magazines, leaflets etc
    for the era and compile a data base what were used most frequently year by year.
    A rather time consuming project requiring some familiarity with the fonts available.
    AFAIK nobody has yet attempted this. The usual way to do this would be for a prof
    to put his students on the task and publish the results under the prof's name.
    \r\nThe foundry specimen books can be misleading. Many fonts were offered but
    few became popular. The main use of these books is to identify fonts that were
    offered for many years -- popularity in terms of duration if not necessarily in
    terms of extent of use.\r\nDon"

  body: Yeah, the point about specimen books being misleading dawned on me some time
    after I'd inquired about Archaic. I've jumped around a bit in looking for typefaces.
    Thanks for your insight, Don.

  body: "I suppose one use of the specimen books as a measure of popularity of a typeface
    is to look at the degree to which \"me too\" typefaces were created.\r\nDesigns
    that were popular with customers were quickly mimicked by very similar fonts from
    competitors. Not identical but the same fashion features.\r\nTakes some judgement
    and digging to find these, but they are a good index of popularity. A good job
    for an academic with some money to spend and a publication credit to get. For
    example look at 1890s ATF fonts, then at the creations of Inland and BB&S. Tantalizing
    info.\r\nDon"

    and a BB&S book from 1907: https://archive.org/details/BBSSpecimenNo9_1907. That
    was about it from the 1890s from those foundries at archive.org. Have you seen
    other specimen books from them? Where did you find them? \r\n\r\nHave you ever
    seen body text (which I hope means text other than headlines) from that time period
    that was in some font other than something that looked really similar to Times
    New Roman, such as a sans serif?"

    terms such as typefounding, printing type, type and type-founding,  Printing --
    Examples, type specimens, printing etc. and they will be revealed.\r\nIf you look
    in the old specimen books you will see a section of smaller scale type which is
    for body text. Some are very different from Times. For example check Ronaldson
    with its big sweeping terminals on letters such a E,R, L and S. Or French Old
    Style, Lightface etc. Off hand, I don't recall any sans-serif for use as a body
    text. This is not to say that a sans-serif was not offered for that purpose.\r\nDon"

    mentioned from that time period.\r\n\r\nI like that Ronaldson is different and
    was described as being the \"best selling\" in the 1900s at Myfonts. I imagine
    most folks who aren't into graphic design just wouldn't notice much of a difference
    between it and other transitional or old-style typefaces. "
