  has interactive word mapping. Does this ring any bells?

  body: No. This isn&#39;t it, but thanks anyway Hrant. -- It isn&#39;t a map in terms
    of geography. It is more a way to work through words. Man I&#39;m gonna die if
    I can&#39;t find it. It had a black background, from what I remember, and you
    would pick a word and then you could explore &#40;so to speak&#41; all the words
    connected to it.

  body: THANK YOU DARREL! It was the visual thesaurus that I needed, but thinkmap
    is perfect as it answers two questions. Thank you!
