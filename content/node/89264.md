  typeface\r\n(yes, Algerian :(   ...But it is for a Victorian-era store) \r\n\r\nThe
  original logo uses alternate caps for the M, A and R. Algerian condensed does have
  these letters. But the digital version of Algerian Regular does not. I have also
  found very similar letters in the Algerian Mesa Alt Caps typeface. But, they appear
  to be slightly different. I have an old Letragraphica specimen sheet with the algerian
  regular alternate letters. But, the M is missing. Below is a scan of the other letters.
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/algerian_reg_a_scan_bothletters_4715.jpg]\r\n\r\n<strong>Does
  anybody know where I could find these letters\u2014either as a computer typeface,
  or a high-resolution copy of a specimen sheet?</strong>\r\n\r\nThank you!"
