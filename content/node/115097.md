body: "Is there a way to position just some nodes of a glyph with Opentype? If yes
  how do I do it?\r\n\r\nI would like to make contextual alternates this way. Like
  for T|Z make the top of Z shorter so it fits better. This way I could avoid generating
  many calt versions and keep my design simple.\r\n\r\nSorry if this has been discussed
  previously. Thanks for your help!"

    of your Z and substitute via the calt OT feature."
