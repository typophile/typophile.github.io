body: "Hi, everyone. I'm new to Typophile and I'm hoping some of you can shed some
  light on a problem I'm having.\r\n\r\nI recently purchased a comprehensive OpenType
  font family that includes a wide range of weights and styles. The problem is that
  the font designer has not style-linked the font family, so I now have over 40 individual
  weights and styles that appear in the font menu. Additionally, I can't take advantage
  of keyboard shortcuts for bold or italic, and typical OpenType features such as
  automatic ligatures or alternative sets are not supported.\r\n\r\nThe font family
  is beautiful and well-designed, but the absence of style-linking and the lack of
  OpenType tyographic features makes production a nightmare. It's incredibly time
  consuming to change weights, insert special characters or switch between old style
  and lining figures.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anyone has experienced this same issue
  and if there's anything I can do on my end to make the fonts more manageable. Are
  there any font management utilities for the Mac that can style-link fonts? I am
  working primarily in Pages and Keynote, if that has any bearing on the issue. \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your help.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Does Pages have style sheets? For a project like this, it might be worth investing
    in InDesign. You'll find that style-linking isn't widely supported by foundries
    for a number of reasons. Style sheets will let you switch character or paragraph
    styles with key commands.

    of the same family -- a family's styles will be automatically grouped in the font
    menu as long as they share the same 'name' table entry for name-ID16, or name-ID1/Mac
    in case of Apple's OSX apps.\r\n(As to bold/italic shortcuts, it is really better
    to use style sheets and assign shortcuts to them, in case that this is possible
    in Pages.)"

  body: "I have style linking enabled in Proxima Nova, but Pages and Keynote ignore
    how it's set up. The Cocoa text engine (which is used in both programs) seems
    to have its own ideas about how styles should be linked. For example, it links
    Regular and Semibold intead of Regular and Bold (the way I set it up). But, if
    you choose the Bold weight first, command-B will toggle between Regular and Bold.
    Or Regular and Extrabold. Black gets paired with Extrabold. A similar thing happens
    with Myriad Pro.\r\n\r\nIn other programs, the linking I set up works perfectly.
    The way InDesign implements it is particularly clever: When you do shift-command-B,
    it toggles between the linked weights. But in doing so, it has exactly the same
    effect as if you had chosen the fonts from the font menu. InDesign has no such
    thing as \"bold\" and \"italic\" styles, but it responds to the traditional keyboard
    short cuts as if it did, honoring the linking built into the font."

    rely on usWeightClass value rather than fsSelection bits for bold/italic, and
    it's the difference between weight values from which the engine infers which is
    the bold?\r\n\r\nAnother guess, regarding the original question: My assumption
    is that in the \"problematic\" fonts, the name ID1 includes both family and style
    name which means that Apple apps recognize them as different families.\r\n\r\nToo
    many guesses for today. Maybe plain nonsense.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)"

    should be pretty straightforward if he's using the AFDKO.\r\nIt might not be practical
    to do it manually; the rules are complex, and I think there's more to it than
    just the name ID16. FWIW, MinionPro-Regular is style-linked with MinionPro-Bold
    and none of the fonts has this name entry. On the other hand, MinionPro-Medium
    is style-linked with MinionPro-MediumIt, they both have name ID16, but they also
    have ID17 and ID18, additionally."

    regards name ID16 (Win-only in AFDKO) I should have said \"name ID16 or its fallback,
    name ID1\". \r\nBut this is not relevant in this case since Apple's engine seems
    to rely on name IDs1+2/Mac only, therefore I added \"or name-ID1/Mac in case of
    Apple\u2019s OSX apps\". If families <cite>appear</cite> to be sorted after name
    IDs16+17 e.g. in TextEdit, this is because IDs1+2/Mac are identical with these
    (which is what AFDKO produces). If IDs1+2/Mac differ from IDs16+17, then the family
    sorting in Pages and e.g. InDesign will differ.\r\nThis was the case up until
    OS 10.3.9; things may be different in 10.4."

  body: "Any family of types with more than 4 styles \u2014 Regular, Italic, Bold,
    Bold Italic \u2014 is poorly served by style-linking. If a family has (for example)
    7 weights in roman and italic, no style-linking arrangement seems terribly comfortable
    or logical. \r\n\r\nI have seen 4-weight style-linked type families where the
    weights are linked thus:\r\nFontname Light = Fontname Lt Regular\r\nFontname Light
    Italic = Fontname Lt Italic\r\nFontname Regular = Fontname Regular\r\nFontname
    Italic = Fontname Italic\r\nFontname Bold = Fontname Bold\r\nFontname Bold Italic
    = Fontname Bold Italic\r\nFontname Heavy = Fontname Lt Bold\r\nFontname Heavy
    Italic = Fontname Lt Bold Italic\r\n\r\nThe resulting two families of 4 fonts
    each are hard to manage and confusing to use. A single menu item with all variants
    in the submenu is a much more logical and workable solution for users."

    If there was a way that all of the Voice variants could appear under a single
    menu item, that would be much simpler than having each style and weight listed
    separately in the font menu. (For example, I also have Lucas DeGroot's large Thesis
    family, and all of its many variants are organized into just three groups -- TheSans,
    TheMix and TheSerif.)\r\n\r\nI can defintely live without keyboard shortcuts for
    bold or italic, and I understand better now why style-linking is not always ideal
    for large families with many weights and styles. I can also live without OpenType
    features like automatic ligatures, although these extras are nice to have.\r\n\r\nI'm
    still a bit unclear regarding how difficult it would be for the designer to rework
    the fonts so that all the variants appear under a single menu. If I ask the designer
    to make a change, I am asking for a small favor or is this a major undertaking?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for educating me on this issue -- I appreciate it!"
