  body: There are far too many fonts with great figures. But, I have to say Dolly
    because they have designed figures that line with the small caps and in my book
    that is giving the designer a full-set of figures.

  body: "Which font has \"the best\" digits in some general sense is really impossible
    to say - it's really situational. (Says the guy who started the [[http://dev.typophile.com/node/28902|\"best
    hyphen\" thread]]...)\r\n\r\nThat said, I've always liked Clarendon.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_4277.jpg]\r\n\r\nVerlag's
    [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_features.php?featureID=18&productLineID=100009|solution

  body: "\"Numerals\" is the authentic moniker for these things. Strange people from
    another planet like me call them \"Numberals, you moron! What's wrong with you?\"\r\n\r\nSome
    of my favorite numberals are the units I drew for Sibyl, and the other one I'm
    not allowed to talk about, but can show:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numberals_4058.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    have other favorite numberals in Other People's Fonts (OPFs). But really, as if
    I've got time to round them all up. My criterion for good numberals is, Do they
    look good enuff to eat? They look like candy or peaches? Right, I'll have 'em.\r\n\r\nMy
    favorite number is 425.\r\n\r\n<em>so, let me also pose another question - can
    you guys think of any more \u201Cexperimental\u201D fonts with interesting numberforms?</em>\r\n\r\nSibyl's
    numberals are experimental (or interesting, depending on how you look at it),
    being old style and cursive, which is somewhat unusual for a blackletter font.
    Most blackletter fonts have lining figures that look like they belong in another
    font.\r\n\r\nIf you want something more experimental or unusual tho, try these:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tuscan_numbers_6329.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>Honestly?
