  really love this forum. I've learned so much in here. I'm an educated graphic designer,
  but type in logos are my biggest challenge. I know how much it means to have the
  right font, spacing and more...\r\n\r\nCan you help me with the font/spacing/lettering
  on this one??\r\n\r\nAnd what do you think: The first (with round corners) or the
  last with hard lines???\r\n\r\nFile is attached...\r\n\r\nThank you in advance...\r\n"

    and bent' (I think I get what you're trying to go for...some sort of power/movement...it
    just isn't hitting the mark.) - it's also so clsoe to symetrical, while not being
    that it's distracting, I'd get a gemoetric grid happening and take the idea further.\r\n\r\nthis

    really would love some ideas for a better font... do you, or anyone, has any?\r\n\r\n\"which
    imo looks 'broken and bent'\" I've made it less bent. Please see below. Is any
    of those better?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trelogoer-02_3461.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    mark should symbolize the first two letters in the logo... please see how below...

  body: "yeah cool, not EXACTLY the concept I thought you were going for...but very
    similar.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that it looks like a point that's been bent or bashed,
    rather than a dynamic pose, I'd move away from mechanical and head toward organic,
    or revise your approach (i.e, to not be a star). The last illustration gets closest
    to this 'abstraction'.\r\n\r\nI'm ignoring the type for now...but as a though,
    it's fairly rigid too."

    we (the client and me) turned towards the more pointy design... :-)"

  body: "I don't see why you should force your mark to resemble a star. It seems to
    be limiting the potential of the design. An abstracted mark that looks more like
    a football player would be much more compelling than a star that is trying (and
    sort of failing) to look like one.\r\n\r\nI just took your images and transplanted
    them together. I know you can't really use this particular football player graphic
    but you may agree that this could be a useful direction.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kmsport_5671.gif]"
