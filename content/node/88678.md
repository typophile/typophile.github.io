  the files and after printing or they are only for the readers. thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  body: Not necessary for printers. Often the printed page numbers are not the same
    as the "real" page numbers anyway. "Page 1" may in fact be page 15, if there is
    unnumbered front matter, etc.

  body: "[[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~typo/glossary/index.htm]] &ndash; This glossary
    will help with many of the outer-space terms used here. Otherwise, as I understand
    it...\r\n\r\nLogical page numbering: PDF readers use this as the primary numbering
    scheme. The first page in the file is page 1, no matter how much front matter
    there is before the 'real' page 1.\r\n\r\nBleed zone: Pages are printed on slightly
    oversized sheets. The extra bits are then trimmed off to get the correct size,
    sharp and neat. You can make use of this to let images flush to the edge by letting
    them extend (bleed) a wee bit into these cut-offs.\r\n\r\nFollow Theunis' advice
    well, and the printer's gunna think: \"Ho! Claire's more pro than she looks like!
    Major coolness!\" It shouldn't harm, either, to ask the printer for the best spot
    to place the page numbers."

  body: "Ah I've been putting all my faith in InDesign for this. In the Printer's
    Marks section of its PDF export dialog, you have this option to add page numbers.
    Long time since I had to do that manually.\r\n\r\nThe printer needs <em>logical</em>
    numbers so he can see at a glance if his impositioning is correct. That's much
    harder if he has to mentally add up leading blanks and/or a roman numbered preamble
    -- and impossible if he's looking at an un-numbered page.\r\n\r\nClare, you also
    mention 'files' -- plural. Your printer is also going to thank you for consecutively
    numbering the files, rather than naming them \"first part\", \"stuff before first
    part\", \"the very first part\" (well you get the idea). Put \"01 -\", \"02 -\"
    etc. in front of your own (probably <em>very</em> logical, in your view) file
    names. Use a leading zero before single digits so no matter what operating system
    the printer uses, the files will appear in the correct order."

  body: "Claire, if your files are prepared logically your printer should be able
    to sequence everything without printed page numbers. However I think page numbers
    may help reduce the possibility of assembly errors, and at the very least will
    make it easier for you to proof the job. If your pages aren't numbered, it may
    be harder for you to spot any pages that are out of sequence in the proof, and
    it may make it harder for your client to communicate changes to you.\r\n\r\nAnd
    incidentally, even though a good printer SHOULD get everything in sequence, printers
    are human and even a good printer can sometimes make a mistake. A few years ago
    I was doing a press check at a high-quality print shop and saw a huge stack of
    brochures (not my job) that had been assembled in the wrong page sequence. My
    rep told me they were very embarassed by the error and would fix it before delivery,
    of course, but unfortunately it caused the job to be delivered late.\r\n"

  body: "My Dutch copy of <em>Watchmen</em> came with the exact same page '10' in
    both of the last two chapters. Very frustrating, as the already complicated story
    suddenly jumped forwards and backwards in time! I blaim Alan Moore for this ;-)
    He re-started page numbering at 1 again for each new chapter -- and apparently,
    the <em>logical</em> page numbering was missing, or overlooked while proofing.\r\n\r\nFortunately
    I also have an English version which has all the pages."

  body: "> or overlooked while proofing\r\n\r\nYes, exactly the point I was making
    in my earlier post. Printers are human and can make mistakes. If the pages don't
    have printed page numbers (or in this case have an unusual numbering system),
    a page sequence error may be much harder for the client to notice in proofing.
    And once you approve the proof,  the printer is off the hook for any unnoticed
    errors.\r\n\r\n"

    exactly do you mean by \"<em>only</em> for the readers\"?\r\nA four-pages pamphlet
    may do without page numbers. But if your publication is supposed to have some
    value beyond being nice to look at, consumed once and then either shelved or trashed,
    you better provide readers with some markers that allow them to point at any passage
    such that other readers are able to find it ... A text is to speak and to be spoken
    about.\r\nIf the text consists of rather short and numbered sections, you might
    do without page numbers, of course."
