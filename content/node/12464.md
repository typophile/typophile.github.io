  i post this in right place :) just move it if not.\r\n\r\nim still working on the
  font, kerning/spacing is not really perfect, but in general: what do you think of
  it?\r\n\r\nits nothing revolutionary, doing such things just helps to get experience.."

  body: "It's nice. The \"a\" seems a bit out of place; the rest of the face is clear
    and simple, without any breaks such as you have in the \"a\".\r\nThe \"y\" is
    alone in not following the construction rules exactly, but I like it, and I think
    you might want to try spreading that style to some of the other letters."

  body: "thanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\ni like the a because it is somehow special,
    brings \"spice\" into the font. but as i wont have any capital letters, i'll probably
    just make a \"normal\" a and have the \"special\" a on the place where a capital
    A would be..\r\n\r\nim really unsure wheter i should keep the y like this or make
    it a bit more like j/g, everybody's telling me something different :)"
