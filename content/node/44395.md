body: "Looking for a really fat serif with extremely thick stems and extremely thin
  serifs/bars. Something along the line of Didot in terms of contrast, but with thicker
  stems then even Heavy Bodoni. \r\n\r\nAnyone know any type foundries that would
  have a font like this?"

  body: "Thanks guys.\r\nBut not quite what im looking for. I might have to custom
    make it. I just wanted an obscenely fat serif with a hairline stress. Nothing
    that could be used for body copy at all."

  body: The contrast in [[Joshua Darden]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/garagefonts/freight_big_package/">Freight
    Big Black</a> has a 1:100 ratio. I doubt it gets any more extreme than that. :^)
