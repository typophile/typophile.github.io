  a sense of movement. Inspiration for a quickie logo I\u2019m going to make for a
  techno project (dance music).  Nothing too painterly, graffiti or cutesy. I\u2019m
  currently raiding Fontsruct but would love any suggestions from you guys!"

    something that's close). For one letter it wouldn't be too costly (especially
    if it's for a modification) and you would have something nobody else does. Many
    people here can do a great job for you on that, including yours truly: hpapazian
