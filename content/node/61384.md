body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nSome help please. I have just bought a copy of DIN and DIN
  ALTERNATE, the font bureau that I bought them from tell me that both fonts are included
  in the same font if that makes sense. \r\n\r\nNow I have bought opentype fonts before
  and usually they have come as seperate files. This hoever is confusing me a little.
  I have bought the fonts as I am updating a magazine and ALTERNATE is used within
  the paragraph styles. \r\n\r\nI can of course select opentype option in the character
  menu but that is not the problem. When I open the file in indesign it of course
  states that there is a missing font, ALTERNATE, but i obviously cant select it in
  the font menu. \r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMatt"

    the OpenType layout feature \"Stylistic Set 1\".\r\n\r\nSo you should replace
    the missing font in InDesign by the normal DIN, and turn on the OpenType feature
    \"Stylistic Set 1\" in your appropriate paragraph style."
