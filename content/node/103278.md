  body: "The bumps on the letters are called center spurs. \r\nThis type of font could
    be called Spurred Roman. Very popular in the mid 19th century and often classified
    as Western or Wild West.\r\nI did not find an exact match.\r\nI found one in a
    heavier weight, called Cowboy Western, from Font Mesa:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/\r\nThere
    are also some fonts in the Western category at dafont.com:\r\nSaddlebag by Dieter
    Steffmann,  K22 Ambelyn by Toto, & Let Me Ride by  M\xE5ns Greb\xE4ck.\r\nDon"

  body: "Don't have a match (yet!). The closest I have is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hydro74/h74-warriors|H74
    Warriors]]. I'm pretty convinced it is a font and not a hand-lanterring. You can
    see [[http://m.hypebeast.com/2011/1/edison-chen-x-nike-sportswear-destroyer-jacket|here]]
    some photos of the making process, one showing the typeset under Illustrator.
    You could also have a look to the video and around 1'09, there's a black flag
    with the type. That could be useful to printscreen and upload it here to make
    identification process easier.\r\n\r\nEDIT: finally got the sample by myself,
    can be shown [[http://s22.postimg.org/6n3pe342p/image.jpg|here]]. Fivos with his
    tremendous software may help."

    body: "The Nike sample is useful. It reveals the spur placement for more letters.
      Fortunately no surprises here. After all the design is about 170 years old.
      Spur placement and inclusion or not on various strokes varied from font to font.\r\nI
      note that the weight shown in this image is a little heavier than the original
      image, perhaps due to blurring. \r\nPresumably the actual Nike font is a match.\r\nBy
      the way, the letters shown in my previous post would need to be heavier to match
      the original image and the serifs adjusted to match.\r\nDon "

  body: "H74 Warriors is a nice font for showing placement of spurs. But the base
    letterform shown in the sample image is a Roman with a unified base and top for
    the stems, rather than the split or bifurcated stems used in H74 Warriors. This
    type of letterform is in the group labelled Tuscan. There was a good discussion
    of the Tuscan Letterform four years ago at http://typophile.com/node/41566 And
    for people who read books there is a substantial chapter on the Tuscan letterform
    in Nicollete Grey's Nineteenth Century Ornamented Type.\r\nDon"

    proprietary font by Nike as many of their letterings.

    am surprised that nothing other than a Tuscan has turned up among the thousands

  body: "If you are happy with Stahl's Tiffany -- a Tuscan with split stems rather
    than the flat ends used on the Nike jacket -- this simplifies your font search.
    However, if some of the comments I encountered in a web search are accurate, Stahl's
    Tiffany is popular with makers of T-shirts and other casual items but they find
    it difficult to purchase separately.\r\nThis is not a major problem as the general
    design of spurred Tuscan fonts has been generic since the mid 19th century. It
    should not be too difficult to find a spurred Tuscan with low contrast and weight
    similar to the Nike font and Stahl's Tiffany for purchase, or even a free version
    with sufficient quality. A search of Myfonts using \"Wild West\" produced several
    spurred Tuscans that you might review: Hessian, Miss. Scarlett, URW Wood Type,
    Saloon Girl, Buckhorn, H74 Warriors [mentioned already by Ryuk], and Saloon. Dafont
    has similar free versions. \r\nDon"

    letters of the uppercase alphabet we already have info on C, L, P & K. The remainder
    are generally obvious -- S & Z on the diagonal; J probably wide & not below baseline;
    \ M & W a couple of versions. Only the tail on Q is a complete unknown. \r\nAs
    far as I understand copyright law [American & related] there is no restriction
    on creating a font, or an eps file, based on an image. But use of the digital
    outlines in a font is a violation. [See the Stone case and the \"distinctive\"

    two years ago answers the essential questions as to the design of the font. \r\nHer
    reference to \"Bowery font\" is interesting. Perhaps the source is lettering from
    old New York? For persons unfamiliar with New York, it had a district informally
    known as  \"The Bowery.\" \r\nDon't know if her email is still current. BTW, I
    am not a registered participant in Myfonts \"WhatTheFont\" form.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: I guess this type is referenced as "Bowery" simply because she has seen it
    at Nike Bowery Stadium, 276 Bowery in Manhattan as all the samples previously
    posted here (flag, varsity Destroyer jacket...).
