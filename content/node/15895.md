  but have been unceremoniously logged out of Typophile while doing so: the problem
  has been fixed. All you need to do is clear your cookies from typophile.com and
  www.typophile.com. The new session cookies will be from .typophile.com which will
  keep you logged in on any sub-domain of Typophile. In fact, you can look at Typophile
  on nearly any sub-domain you can think of, switching willy-nilly from one page to
  another. '
