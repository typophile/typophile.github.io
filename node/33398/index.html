<p>jpad: I do have other photographs that often show the signs in their entirety. However it was/is my intention with this project to really focus on using the camera as a compositional tool while examining the unique letterforms and weathering of each sign. I guess in some ways I do not see the documentation, appreciation, and recontextualization as three separate things, but as a single goal—each component of which is essential to the other. Hopefully that makes sense.</p>
<p>Essentially I wanted, personally, to admire these letterforms as something a little removed from their original intent. The camera was my way of doing that. Hence the &lsquo;arty&rsquo; compositions of these images.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;d also like to see whole letters and signs. I think the audience here is different from the average layperson or photographer: whatever the medium, I am interested in the letterforms first and foremost. So these fragments are frustrating for me, especially knowing there is more. For that matter, you could bring these same images, or other photos of the same signs, to an even more abstract level than you have. Why leave them recognizable as letters, or even as signs?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see the documentation, appreciation, and recontextualization as three separate things, but as a single goal—each component of which is essential to the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would argue with that. Document: record. Appreciate: view, assess. Recontextualize: obscure, dislodge, reframe, repurpose. One of these is not like the others. It may be that your goal for this project is all three, and of course I can&rsquo;t argue with that. But this audience may value the originals more than the recontextualizations.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>crossgrove,</p>
<p>thanks for the insightful comments.</p>
<p>you may very well be right—it may be an issue of audience. I can indeed understand why these photographs may frustrate those looking for full specimens. But the aim here is to appreciate the micro (as opposed to macro) properties of the letterforms by focusing on the presence of nature and the human hand and not so much the content of the sign itself. This is the reason that the letters are not completely abstracted.</p>
<p>To this end the &ldquo;document, appreciate, and recontuxtualize&rdquo; components are not the same things, but equal parts of an inseperable process. if i had stripped the recontextualize portion from this process we would probably be seeing the full sign. However for me the crop and composition play an essential role in allowing the viewer (typographer or otherwise) to appreciate the work on a formal/sensory level.</p>

TO be fair, I considered the term &ldquo;document&rdquo; lightly on the front of the site, but the pictures document well other things, such as  the chemistry of the decomposition, quite well. Brad&rsquo;s recontextualization (as pretty art stuff)is what creates the value to some of us, as too busy adults, to go and appreciate. It also helps keep me from reading the words in what is a picture, to some extent. Could there be more type-documentation and less recontexting? Sure, but this works well for me. Also, ya can&rsquo;t beat the price.</div>

Just had a cursory glance but a great project. I do take the point about showing complete pictures instead of details, at least for this audience, but the images are neat. For publishers one guy who loves this stuff is Steven Heller. I won&rsquo;t speak for him but he should be able to help. He is <a href="http://www.hellerbooks.com/index.html">here</a>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just a quick note to say I just returned from my childhood home of New Orleans and managed to take some photos along the way. The new photos can be seen in the &lsquo;Latest Additions&rsquo; album—you will notice I am now making a conscious effort to take 2 shots (sometimes more) to satisfy those wishing to see the whole sign as well as those drawn to the more abstracted crops.</p>
<p>Some of the signs in the Newest Additions gallery are the same signs I have photographed before, but I can never resist an opportunity to perhaps look at these in a new way.</p>
<p>Trips to Chicago and Seattle are planned within the next month, so I should have more to add to the site then.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all the kind words and suggestions. The overall response has been quite positive and has given me a new energy for this project. I am still far away from pushing for book publication, but I do have a few ideas of how I would like to see lettermade grow in the future.</p>
<p>Regards,
Brad.</p>
