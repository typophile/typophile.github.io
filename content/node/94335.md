body: "If a typeface is well spaced for use at paragraph sizes, the white inside and
  between letters should appear \u2014 generally speaking \u2014 equal. If one goes
  about spacing the same face for display use, you\u2019ll need to space it somewhat
  tighter. If you decrease the white between letters, shouldn\u2019t you also decrease
  the white inside letters? This will most likely be achieved with a display variant.
  My question is: How do you decrease the internal white? Draw the letters narrower?
  Where do you take it from? Increase the size of serifs? Lower the x-height? Make
  the stems heavier? \r\n\r\nI wonder, since typically, a display variant would be
  lighter, have a taller x-height and even sometimes smaller serifs: all <em>increasing</em>
  the white inside letters, leaving the heavy lifting to width.\r\n\r\n"

    letters should appear equal? \r\n\r\nDisplay versions are lighter as you say,
    and they may be spaced very tightly at times... although in recent decades wide
    spacing hasn\u2019t exactly been absent from the scene! "

    black and white could be beneficial for immersive reading, the <em>notan</em>
    of a display cut would adhere to different rules.\r\nNot least because the different
    relationship with whitespace."

    and rythm of black and white \u2014 <em>notan</em>, if you like that term \u2014
    \ in a text face serves the purpose of creating an even \u201Csurface\u201D for

  body: "I like the term just because it\u2019s japanese ;-)\r\nAnd what I\u2019m
    trying to say is:\r\n<ul><li>For a text face, the optimal relationship between
    black and white is of an equal rhythm, both horizontally <em>and</em> vertically
    (every line of text relating to the preceding and following ones).</li>\r\n<li>For
    a display face, that relationship is more akin of that of graphics. And its vertical
    relationship is with other graphical elements on the page (the whitespace, paragraphs
    as a whole, etc.).</li></ul>\r\nBlack and white relationship doesn\u2019t need
    to be equal, it needs to be complementary. And a \u201Cdisplay\u201D line of text
    could need a tighter spacing in order to not \u201Cfalling apart\u201D, because
    it lacks the support of a whole paragraph. But that doesn\u2019t mean it need
    to be darker too: a single black dot on an otherwise white page is equally distinguishable,
    regardless of its size."
