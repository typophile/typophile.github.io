  body: "Yes, this put a smile on my face too.\r\n\r\nA full reference of the study
    it mentions:\r\n\r\nSantana, A. D., Livingstone, R. & Cho, Y. (2010). Medium matters:
    Newsreaders\u2019 recall and engagement with online and print newspapers. <em>Annual
    meeting of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication</em>.
    August 10, 2011.\r\n\r\nThe stats in the middle get a little heavy, but the discussion
    section (p 23\u201325) is very well written. It should also be mentioned that
    this study used a <em>between subjects</em> experimental design (participants
    were exposed to only 1 condition: print or digital) as opposed to a <em>within
    subjects</em> design (all participants are exposed to all conditions). This raises
    the problem of the chance that in the paper condition, there just so happened
    to be a lot more people who read the news on paper compared to the digital group,
    which would obviously skew the results."
