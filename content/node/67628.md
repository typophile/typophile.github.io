  would be happy to get any comments from all of you, because I didn't had much feedback
  from typographers.\r\n\r\nAnyway, when I made it, I didn't tought it would be accepted
  on MyFonts, so when I saw people was buying it, I started to think about a full
  charachter set and redesigning all glyphs to make them work better each others.
  I'm also working on the kerning, hinting and all things that needs to be done to
  make it more 'professionnal'.\r\n\r\nThanks by advance,\r\n\r\nBernard.\r\n\r\nEdit
  :\r\n\r\nSorry for bumping guys, but I think my post should be in this place rather
  than in Release, as it's still a work in progress, and I'd be very glad to get any
  comment.\r\n\r\nI'm not here to tell you \"Yo Dude, buy my font!\"."

  body: "<P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend
    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap

    about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to
    britney\u2019s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty,
    broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd\u2019s usually are not all
    that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage
    to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a
    couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard
    to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals
    Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get
    those ghd\u2019s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults
    include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P>"

    to peek in and say I really like this. I agree it might benefit from a little
    more polish here and there, but it's a very cool idea for a font, and seems quite
    nicely executed too. \r\n(BTW, Motion/Experimental? I'd have put it in the \xABDisplay\xBB
    category.)"

  body: "Thank you very much for your comment. I'm always wondering if that idea is
    a good one.\r\n\r\nDo you think making a complete \"basic latin\" set would be
    useful for this kind of font ?\r\nAs it can't be used for something else than
    headlines, I'm wondering if spending my time making it is a good thing or if It'd
    better for me to get a beer and start watching TV ?\r\n\r\nFor the forum, I'm
    a bit confused. As nobody was saying anything when I posted it in the Release
    section, I've reposted it in Critique/Display, then I saw \"Experimental\", so
    I thought it'd be better here. But I can move it back to Display if it's more
    appropriated."

    not be the best person to ask that question. ;-)\r\nSeriously though \u2013 I
    didn't previously realize you don't have Basic Latin. My first language is German,
    and without \xC4, \xD6 and \xDC I can't even set all headlines that I might need
    to. :-\\  So yes, I think making basic diacritics for this font should be a good
    idea \u2013 and a cool little challenge, actually. I could imagine you can come
    up with some pretty cool solutions."

    as you said, it's a cool [\u2026] challenge to make them all, I already have designed

    me about the original was the counter of the Q, so I'm glad to see you've already
    changed it for the better. Numerals, currency, braces are great.\r\n\r\nAsterisk
    and daggers lack twist. I would have expected them to be all outward loops.\r\nExclamation
    could be wider.\r\nBottom half of Yen symbol should probably be a vertical rectangle.\r\nAmpersand
    seems rigid. I'd try trading the two little loops in the upper right for one big
    diagonal loop.\r\nFor @, I recommend starting over and not basing it on the A.
    I can see a big spiral with the inner end connected to the outer end.\r\n"

  body: "This is a really innovative take on a display font. I like it lots. Not only
    is it very different but it's also legible. Complete it and put it out there.
    I'm sure it will get used. Very nice indeed.\r\n\r\nAbout your variations: I think
    the only one that's actually working is the middle one. Filled shapes with negative
    outlines. But you may as well forget about the other two. If anyone wanted to
    get the effect of the first variation, they can do it with the original outlined
    font, and the last one doesn't look good and has some legibility problems.\r\n\r\nAbout
    some shapes:\r\n\r\n/H/ is not good. It doesn't resemble H. When I see it in alphabet
    I know it's an H, but if I'd see in in text I'd have problem recognising it. All
    the others are.\r\n\r\n/!/ exclamation mark should be heavier. Considerably.\r\n\r\n/%/
    should be changed. I suppose it wouldn't be bad to try to overlap circled with
    the straight\r\n\r\n/@/ although similar to how reg.trademark and copyright are
    done I suppose it's not a good solution. Although it makes me think who would
    want to write their email address using this display font (stupid of me... who
    would want to use Comic Sans in formal papers either?! We can see that many =
    this means you have to make @ recognisable).\r\n\r\n"
