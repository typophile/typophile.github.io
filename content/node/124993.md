body: "Hi, I created the logo below for my wife's business, Our PC was recently hit
  with ransom ware and we had to wipe everything. For some reason I hadn't backed
  up any of the logo / website artwork so we lost it all. \r\n\r\nI can't for the
  life of me remember the fonts. I have spent the last hour looking through 1001freefonts.com
  as I'm sure I got them on there but I cant find them.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that
  the \"jewellery\" text is actually a pre installed windows font. I'm hoping someone
  can shed some light as to which are the two fonts I have used.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMike\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MjM3NUNDMEIyODVCOUYyNEMyNTY6MzUxMjEyOGM4MDc4OTFlOWJiZGE4NWEyMjA0ZDRiMjA6Ojo6OjA=_6104.jpg]"
