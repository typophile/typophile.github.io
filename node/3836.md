body: i know this one will be kind of easy for most of you. at first i thought it
  was myriad, but it didn&#39;t take long to rule that out. it&#39;s on a cd that
  came out in 1991, if tht helps at all.  <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/2978.jpg"

    <BR> <BR>BTW, am I the only person who thinks the lc &#34;a&#34; in Stone Serif
    should be given a public flogging? <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Character?id=0061&amp;vid=117874&amp;charset=CP2&amp;charpage="

    <BR>Sorry, but that flabby, pretentious wannabe of a glyph makes me queasy. <BR>

  body: ' thanks hrant. i feel a bit unsmart for not knowing that. i&#39;ll have to
    remember that test drive thing at myfonts. and no, you&#39;re not the only one
    who favors a flogging. i&#39;m not a great fan of the sans either, but i guess
    that&#39;s what happens when you stare at univers for too long. i agree with marc
    though. the sans is worse, or should i say not as good as, the serif. one last
    question: should these letterforms be given due process or this more like a kangaroo
    court? '

  body: ' &#62; why do you not like the lc &#34;a&#34;? <BR> <BR>I guess because it&#39;s
    like a politician: some parts are firm, but mostly the elements blend together
    too congenially. And that bulb... like carrion. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s interesting
    is how many people have a certain dislike for Stone &#40;I mean the font - the
    person himself is highly respected, and rightly so&#41;. Maybe it gets attention
    for being a &#34;superfamily&#34;, but in fact there&#39;s some deep flaw that
    manifests in different ways in each component. Dunno. And maybe it&#39;s a problem
    with the whole &#34;Adobe school of design&#34; - a lot of their &#34;a&#34;s
    are sickly. <BR> <BR>&#62; should these letterforms be given due process or this
    more like a kangaroo court? <BR> <BR>If Typophile had any kind of &#34;legislative&#34;
    power at all, I myself wouldn&#39;t be here. Instead, it is something actually
    useful: a place where people can say what&#39;s on their mind, instead of playing
    politics &#40;even though sometimes it seems to have to be done anonymously&#41;.
    Criticism leads to progress, as uncomfortable as it usually is. <BR> <BR>hhp '
