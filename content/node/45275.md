  Australia and for my Honours project I'm creating a series of numbers only fonts.
  Project description below:\r\n\r\nMelbourne is not shy of its history. Supporting
  a diverse variety of architectural styles of the buildings, juxtaposed with the
  hip street culture of today and the yesteryears as depicted in faded murals and
  advertisements\u2014Melbourne openly invites people to explore its layers of visual
  narratives. The accessibility of its roads and laneways give people, residents or
  visitors, the chance and pleasure to delve into it at their leisure. There is, however,
  a side of Melbourne that is forgotten, more often than not: the up side. I believe
  that this is merely because people are used to seeing things on their eye levels
  when walking around. By doing so, they are missing out on the beautiful architectural
  letterings mostly located on the face of the building, way above eye levels; the
  building names and the years they were built, most of which were done in a more
  subjective, expressive way.\r\n\r\nThis, in a way, mirrors how I see numerals in
  typeface design. In the past, \u201Ctypefounders considered numbers separately from
  the provision of other printing types\u2026 Nineteenth century type specimen books
  often displayed a separate section containing fonts of numbers alone.\u201D*. These
  days, however, I believe that numbers design is the black sheep of typeface design.
  It is as important as alphabet design but nowadays it is often not given as much
  care.\r\n\r\n3000 is an intertwining journey of these two interests. It is my attempt
  to create something concrete from my typographic exploration of Melbourne CBD\u2014looking
  at vernacular typography and investigating the social history and typographic expression
  of Melbourne CBD through found architectural numerals. The outcome will be a series
  of fully working, numerals only digital fonts\u2014as well as a type specimen book
  and a publication documenting the research process.\r\n\r\n*Jonathan Hoefler and
  Tobias Frere-Jones, www.typography.com\r\n\r\nThe specimen is here: http://typophile.com/node/45274\r\n\r\nMy
  questions are:\r\n1. What do you think of numbers only fonts? \r\n\r\n2. Is there
  any recommended books on numerals design? (I'm currently reading Walter Tracy's
  \ Letters of Credit and also Bringhurst's The Elements of Typographic Style)\r\n\r\n3.
  Regardless what H&FJ said, I can't find any type specimen book with numbers-only
  sections,nineteenth century of otherwise. Has anyone come across any of these books?\r\n\r\nAny
  comment/feedback will be much appreciated. Thanks.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nChrista"
