  body: I suspected those as well but neither sport the same "R". This "R" seems more
    condensed.

  body: Haley created this thread based on a post I made in another forum. I finally
    heard back from my client who supplied these mock-ups and they said the font is
    <a href="http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/block-gothic-extra-bold-condensed.aspx">Block
    Gothic Extra Bold Condensed</a>. Doesn't seem right at all. The "J" and "R" are
    off.
