body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nFirst time poster here, hopefully you can help me with
  something.\r\n\r\nI've recently opened an older Typeface I designed back in 2004
  (ARS Robust) in order to take another swing in implementing a feature that is essential
  to the character of the Typeface, before I officially release it. \r\n\r\nThe design
  integrates two types of attachable shapes (serifs) that in combination with the
  letter forms can create custom ligatures or aesthetic modifications to the letters
  or spacing at will, chosen by the user/designer. The system i came up with so far
  is placing each form in different places with different key combination. \r\nI'm
  not sure this is a very user-friendly system, do you? I'm trying to solve this maybe
  with OpenType coding or something like that.\r\n\r\nI've attached a pic of the font/feature
  so you can see what I mean.\r\n\r\n<strong>The issue is applying a single shape
  or several at a time to a character either at the top left or bottom right or both..
  whatever, where ever you want it... AUTOMATICLY. Is something like this possible
  with OpenType?</strong>\r\n\r\nObviously the possibilities and combination will
  be virtually endless if I to make ALL the ligatures in font itself (think of the
  endless combination you can generate from 4 digits).\r\n\r\nAnyone has any suggestion
  on how to tackle this?\r\n\r\nBest, Angus\r\n\r\nps. (Sorry for the long post)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ARSRobust_automatic_6665.png]"

  body: You can do a series of stylistic alternates, but I don't think you can have
    them linked to a keyboard shortcut without creating such shortcuts (to the stylistic
    alternates) in for instance InDesign.

  body: "What about having the font smart enough to use the alternates automatically?\r\n\r\nThis
    is going to be tough to do without separate glyphs. There are a lot of permutations
    for doing it with alternates. If a letter has four positions you could attach
    something to, and the options for each position are nothing, or a short thing
    or a long thing, that's 3^4 or 81 variants for those letters. Ouch.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Is it not feasible to create only connector blocks (1 above, 1 below, both
    above and below), and have OpenType insert the correct one between any combination
    of characters?

  body: "Thanks for your input guys!\r\n\r\nClaus; I suppose Stylistic Sets would
    have to be used in some form, but if you mean that they'll contain all the possible
    combinations that will result in hundreds (if not more) of characters. Or did
    you mean something else? please correct me.\r\n\r\nThomas; Indeed some alternates
    and ligatures (are) will be made separately - the ones that don't involve the
    attachable blocks mostly. However, as you say, making all the ligature/alternate
    possibilities separately is exactly what I definitely want to avoid. And yet I
    somehow believe there's a way... \r\n\r\nTheunis; That's more or less what I'm
    trying to figure out. As for now, those are in fact 2 types of separate \"connector
    blocks\" as you call them (6 in total) - two (short & long) for top, two for bottom
    and two middle ones for the small caps. All with 0 cell width, and considering
    the designer leaves the automatic spacing to the font (and not the software),
    can be applied to the character at courser position with the help of (awkward)
    key-shortcuts (see picture).\r\n\r\nUnless someone sees a different solution,
    I realize more and more that applying them with key-shortcuts is the way to go,
    but I still think it's a bit of a tedious system.\r\n\r\nI recall Mathew Charter
    designed a font system a while ago for the Walker Art Center, which used a similar
    feature with attachable serif shapes to a basic Sans font. How do you suppose
    he solved that?\r\n\r\nhttp://design.walkerart.org/detail.wac?id=2098&title=articles&style=images\r\n\r\nI'm
    not a coder and I wish to make this feature a bit more intuitive and user friendly
    somehow without sacrificing existing (important) characters. If only the OpenType
    format could meet me half way on this. \r\n\r\nPerhaps, for example, making the
    key-shortcuts more intuitive and easy to remember with the help of OpenType?\r\n\r\n"
