    but it looks like something similar to [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/scangraphic/cooper_black_sh_regular_italic/|Cooper
    Black Italic]].\r\n\r\nIf your looking for beautiful black italic type, I'd look
    at H&FJ's [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100019&itemID=200050&cpuCount=|Proteus
    Project]]\r\n\r\nAnalisa"

    guys - yes a small sample but thats all i have.\r\n\r\nimmm, creampuff maybe.\r\n\r\nthats
    funny as i used that font on a logo i did for hyundai a few years back see above...\r\n\r\njust
    looking for like a rounded hybrid serif that is a little fun i guess.\r\n\r\ncooper
    black italic is cool but a little heavy perhaps."
