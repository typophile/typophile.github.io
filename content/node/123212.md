body: From a book I typeset in the early 1980s using an Exxon Qyx electronic typewriter
  interchangeable wheel font, whose name I cannot remember.  Some of their fonts were
  well known but this one maybe a Qyx house font. Note that the typographers quotes
  and apostrophe in the attached sample were not on the wheel. They were made by typing,
  cutting out and pasting commas.  Thank you for any help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ExxonQyxfont_4448.jpg]
