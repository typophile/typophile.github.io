  body: What do you like about this design? The chubby feeling, like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/emigre/los_feliz_bold_italic/">Los
    Feliz</a>? The swashiness, like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_bookman_std_bold_italic/?s=c">ITC
    Bookman Swash</a> (click the characters in the overview to see the swash variants)?
    Just to know in what direction we need to look.

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nI'm making a logo for a brasserie/restaurant. It has to be
    classy, but also modern. So I'm looking for a modern swashed font, preferably
    a serif font. Not to curly. ITC Bookman comes really near. Love the Nespresso
    logo by the way. Looking for that kind of look and feel.\r\n\r\n"
