body: "Greetings all. First time poster. I've trying to find a pairing face for a
  custom wordmark that I've done for a mixed martial arts company (yuck, I know).
  The wordmark is comparable to something like the ford logo. I can't seem to think
  of anything that really works well enough for me to present.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?
  \r\n\r\nThanks. "

  body: Futura condensed seems to be working pretty well. It's a big aggressive, which
    fits the target audience. Thanks for the help.

    and make that thinner, while thickening the right stroke and adding a spur to
    that.\r\nAlso make the right stroke of the \"r\" closer to x-height.\r\n\r\n"

    agree with making the left stroke thinner and the right one thicker, as well as
    moving the right stroke closer to the x height. I think the spur should stay where
    it is though, the rest of the characters have a spur on the left, but maybe the
    contrast is a good thing? \r\n\r\nI certainly appreciate the feedback."

  body: I was concerned about the possible 'w' being visible. I showed it to a number
    of people and it didn't seem like a big deal. Do you really think it is? It would
    take a lot more time to fix that.

  body: It's that the thinner stem of the r is very rigid compared to all other letters.
