Their answers are soundbites parroted straight from the news or come from a shaky grasp of current events. They range from &quot;if it weren't for Bush, I would have no place to ride my jet ski&quot; (!) and &quot;he's against gay marriage.&quot;  <BR> <BR>Some of the more thoughtful Republicans have a resigned &quot;our leader, right or wrong&quot; attitude. A few are even beginning to question the long-term effects of Bush's way of doing things. I won't even mention the ones with a Stepford view of his policies.

		<div class="commentbody">America is, as it always is, split pretty evenly on the issue of GW. I think the majority (narrowly) want him out, but the majority is also fragmented and not of one mind on the subject of who would be better. <BR> <BR>Speaking from my own viewpoint (I live on the East Coast of the US, in Philadelphia), I think those against Bush are more mobilized because his administration is much more forthright in exerting its policies, and therefore more angering than many people are used to. It operates with an ideal view in mind and a very strong hand, but a truckload of contradictions that weaken their assertions.  <BR> <BR>Also, he is very preferential to fundamentalist Christianity, and evangelical groups. This is a real flashpoint for the U.S., because we are always playing our desire for freedom and democracy (in their most general senses) against our moralistic and puritan underpinnings/ foundations. I think many of his supporters seek more certainty in the world and in politics, which is reflected in a religious world view. Unfortunately, the issues he is trying to grapple with and overcome are very slippery and grey. His entire <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/">re-election campaign's</a> foundation is strong, steady leadership with a clear agenda and knows &quot;exactly how to make the world better.&quot; ( a quote from one of his TV spots) You either believe him, or you don't.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Re: Jim Richardson <BR> <BR>Jim, it's a little disingenuous to qualify what you said as &quot;just your own opinion&quot;, given what you said at the start of the thread: <BR> <BR><i>&quot;. . .the impression of George W Bush inside America is the same as the view in Europe[;] [b]asically that he is a dangerous very right wing leader who is in the pocket of big business, and who intends to run an election campaign based on racism and fear?</i> <BR> <BR>It sounds very much like you're claiming this to be the &quot;European&quot; position.  And that's one of the problems with this whole mess: Polarity. Generalization.  Assumption.  On both sides.  I've heard comparisons ranging from Forrest Gump to Hitler.  And people don't seem to feel the need to back their statements up anymore, as demostrated by Kevin Pease: <BR> <BR><i>&quot;The trouble is that there is a majority of Americans who are easily led like sheep. Ask someone in the thrall of the Republican propaganda machine what it is they like about Bush, and they will invariably refer to his &quot;honesty.&quot; What can you say to such willful ignorance?&quot;</i> <BR> <BR>It's a little drastic to lump every Bush supporter into the &quot;Republican Propaganda Machine&quot; category, and it's especially ironic given the progandistic tone of this sort of statement.  But no, I know a number of people support Bush for many reasons, most of them logical and well-considered. <BR> <BR>&quot;Support&quot; does not automatically imply that the supporter is willing to back Bush up on every issue.  For example, I agree with the idea behind his tax cuts, but not his exorbitant fiscal policy; I agree that the war in Iraq was necessary, but disagree that it was done for the right reasons.  Right now, as happens so frequently, I see Bush as the lesser of two evils.  Also, Kevin seems to slight the issue of character, which I think is central to any political decision. Quite frankly, I'd rather have someone trustworthy in office than someone intelligent or experienced.  There are loads of experienced, intelligent people involved in politics for strictly self-serving ends, and while I'm under no illusions that Bush is strictly altruistic, I do believe that he's trying to do what he feels is right rather than what he thinks is popular. I think John Edwards also had this type of character, and although I disagree with him on nearly every political issue, I still would have considered his very strongly. <BR> <BR>The point of way too much text: 1) Polarity needs to decrease.  People need to be rational about what they say and willing to back it up.  2) Character is the most important quality in a leader.</div>

Would it be too easy to make a crack about our voting machines? <BR> <BR>Just had to comment on Daniel's point that Bush does what he believes to be the right thing, regardless of how popular it is.

		<div class="commentbody">Remarkably, I am not the poster boy for polarization. The source of all political evil in the United States is the two-party system. I am rather upset that the Democrats are taking advantage of the situation by forcing the most mediocre candidate they have upon us. I considered writing to General Clark and begging him to run as an independent after he dropped out of the primaries, but Election 2004 is too much of an emergency situation. Those of us who have been paying attention are going to have to vote for Kerry, with the likelihood that soon we will be saying &quot;Damn, Kerry is doing a crappy job as President, but at least he's not turning America into an Orwellian nightmare.&quot; <BR> <BR>I am not slighting the issue of character. Honesty is a great thing. Boy, would I love an honest President. <BR> <BR>Yes, I increasingly feel like &quot;backing up&quot; every statement is a waste of time. There are terabytes of proof of this administration's continuous and brazen dishonesty if you wanted to look at it; I'm not going to offer examples one at a time for you to ignore. If Ashcroft said the sky was green and I pointed directly at the blue sky, neocons would refuse to look up, calling my index finger a biased source. <BR> <BR>And yes, I think the sheep syndrome is worse here. Only in America is the science of evolution considered an unpopular opinion, a &quot;belief system&quot; that legislators are to this day trying to prevent children from learning about in schools. That's what it's like here. Having gutted the constitution, criminalized public dissent, scuttled the economy, created a monstrous deficit mostly in the form of a blank check to Haliburton, sent thousands to their deaths, and with the near-certainty of needing to reinstate the draft after reelection, Bush has somehow suddenly made the #1 issue of the upcoming election The Gay Menace. Stop thinking about all those other things, homosexuals threaten your way of life! And everybody complies. They stop thinking about all those other things! Even if they're on the other side of the issue, they let themselves be manipulated. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The problem with a party system that allows for greater degrees plurality, is that it creates a system where the votes are so scattered that the winners are determined by small percentages 10% vs. 12% vs. 6%, etc. of voters, rather than a more substantial one. And while the reality is that these fragmentations of opinon always exist, if the system doesn't try to create an outward unity, it will suffer for it. <BR> <BR>I don't like everything about the 2 party system, but it brings focus to an election and forces a consensus in the name of stability and pragmatics. And while consensus never truly exists, we <i>are</i> talking about a political system, which is an idealogical cosntruct that creates false consensus anyway, so I don't think that's too unreasonable. It polarizes people, but people do that on their own. We just need to ensure that those in power can see through that cloud to stand by their ideals (can you hear me, Mr. Kerry?), but not disregard the rest of the world or assume they have a greater hold on objective moral truths than everyone else (can you hear me, Mr. Bush?). <BR> <BR>PS: I used to be much more anti-two party, but I'm not sure that the alternative buys us anything more.</div>

All over the world, including in Iraq, surveys I believe show that people 'get' the value of democratic elections.  <BR> <BR>My late teacher Karl Popper - who lived through the rise and fall of both Nazism and Communism - argued in 'The Open Society and its Enemies' that representative democracy is the only way to get rid of bad governments without violence, and for that reason is an essential building block for a good society.  <BR> <BR>To oppose democrary is to permit the rule of cruel tyrants like Kim Jong Il and Saddam Hussein. <BR> <BR>But more than this, representative government on local as well as national levels provides a feedback mechanism for ideas and experiments, and information about their success and failure, to change for the better.  <BR> <BR>For these reasons, I think the opposition to democracy or contempt for democrary sometimes voiced on these boards is not only wrong, but, in the light of world experience, asinine. <BR> <BR>Democracy is by no means the only key to an open society. Protection of the rights of minorities and a will to correct extreme inequalities is also critical. But democracy is nonetheless essential to sustaining decent governments.</div>

He did not have the capability to launch himself at the United States, and if he did all it would accomplish would be a red stain on the ground. Saying &quot;Saddam was the WMD&quot; is a semantic trick that ignores the reason we were looking for WMD: The fabricated threat that Iraq could kill us all in our homes at any moment was the rationale given for rushing into a quagmire with no international support and no plan, as opposed to finding the right time to do the job properly. <BR> <BR>Democracy is good thing, but the USA, strictly speaking, is not a democracy.

It is often whipped into a frenzy of hating and blaming foreigners for all problems, instead of their own despotic and criminal governments who are the main ones responsible. It is an old trick of despotic governments, but unfortunately it often works.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Only in America is the science of evolution considered an unpopular opinion, &hellip;legislators are to this day trying to prevent children from learning about in schools.  <BR> <BR>This is very misleading. As you will see <a href="http://www.nabt.org/sub/position_statements/evolution.asp" target="_blank">here</a>, US law established  by the Supreme court is to teach evolution. Fundamentalists are fighting a rearguard action, and losing.  <BR> <BR> <BR>&gt;USA, strictly speaking, is not a democracy. Eliminate the Electoral College, and actually count write-in votes, and then we would have a democracy. <BR> <BR>We have one kind of democratic respresentation. The decision to include geographic weighting (as we do in the Senate of the US also) may be debatable or imperfect but it is still a democratic system. Bringing in the Supreme court to settle the last presidential election was a breakdown of democracy, though was at least legal. We got the wrong guy, also, in my opinion.</div>

The dumping of the surplus production for free (or nearly free) to poorer nations means that the farmers from such countries cannot compete and are driven out of jobs, further slanting the &quot;market share&quot; of the larger producers such as the US and Europe.</i> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Poverty/FoodDumping/Intro.asp" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Poverty/FoodDumping/Intro.asp">http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Poverty/FoodDumping/Intro.asp</a></a> <BR> <BR>And for our friend that is frightened by  the great Cuban liberator, Fidel Castro. Worse things have happened in Cuba by Americans torturing innocent youths. Human rights dictatorship vs human rights democracy. <BR> <BR>Do you see the difference? Honesty vs hypocracy! <BR> <BR>But if you want to laugh like the Mexicans. <BR> <BR><i>Polite people are not supposed to remember the reaction when Kennedy tried to organize collective action against Cuba in 1961: Mexico could not go along, a diplomat explained, because &quot;If we publicly declare that Cuba is a threat to our security, forty million Mexicans will die laughing.&quot; Here we take a more sober view of threats to the national security.</i></div>
