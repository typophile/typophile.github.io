  procrastination adrenaline isn't giving me any good ideas. Any suggestions for what
  text face would look good with Matrix Script Bold as the headline font? Thanks!

  body: I think the real challenge is to find an Emigre font that doesn't have at
    least one character you want to redesign! No offense to anybody but try the "a"
    in Priori, the "k" in Dalliance, the list goes on and on. It's so frustrating.

  body: "Nah. I disagree, Hrant. If you think Eidetic works as text then Tribute qualifies
    as a text font. Vendetta too. Fairplex might. Mrs. Eaves sorta. Eidetic has some
    characters that really leave me cold. I would only use it as a display font.\r\n\r\n[Edit:
    Generally, Eidetic isn't my cup of tea. That's all.]"

  body: "I don't love Eidetic. But I try to put my personal tastes\r\naside when it
    comes to judging if a font is texty or not.\r\n\r\nTribute: I agree, it's a text
    face. Note that I put a\r\nquestion mark after \"still only\" - basically because
    I\r\nhaven't been following Emigre recently. I remember\r\nwhen Eidetic came out
    I thought it was their first real\r\ntext face - so I stand by that. Tribute's
    \"g\" was suspect\r\nto me when I first saw it, but then I saw the issue of\r\nthe
    magazine where it was used, and realized it's fine.\r\nSo I'm sorry, I forgot
    to remember Tribute.\r\n\r\nVendetta: Out of context I agree that it <cite>can</cite>
    be a\r\ntext face. But it has a \"fatal\" problem in that respect:\r\nits central
    feature -the facetness- can only really click\r\nwith optical masters. Lacking
    optical masters, that feature\r\nbasically kills it as a well-rounded text font:
    if you set it\r\nat more than one size, it becomes more than one face.\r\nExcoffon
    knew this, which is why -even with the\r\navailability of the pantograph- he decided
    to make\r\nMistral's roughness inversely proportional to size.\r\n\r\nThe others:
    no.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    one in my book."

    axis and the high regularity put it outside\r\nwhat I class as a text face. With
    some ink bleed at small\r\nsizes it would have a better chance, but its proportions\r\nare
    too dainty for small text.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Fairplex was a bad suggestion. It is more a display/headline/advertising text
    font. Filosofia is a Didone, but a very warm and warn one. Again, though, not
    completely well suited for reading. I once saw a cookbook done with Vendetta and
    it was lovely. I think Vendetta might be a tad thin, but if you use the Medium
    weight and can afford a larger point size it is nice.
