    you stated are from the Private Use Area.\r\n\r\nTo my best knowledge, Windings
    is actually 8-bit \"Symbol\" encoded.\r\nI suspect, InDesign maps \"symbol\"-encoded
    fonts to the PUA internally -- it might be, that CS2 and CS3 versions use different
    mappings (which they can. That's the catch [and the benefit] of the PUA, it's
    not standardised, codepoint meanings are left to the user/application).\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I have never used InDesign and might have no clue..."

    are the ones CS3 uses.)\r\nBut I am confused that CS2 would completely remap the
    values and also refuses to accept the \"right\" PUA values. "

  body: "The thing is that Wingdings uses a \"Symbol\" (3.0) cmap rather than a \"Unicode\"
    (3.1) cmap, so applications and operating systems need to deal with them in a
    special way. Microsoft Windows maps the 256 Symbol codes to U+F000-U+F0FF. My
    guess is that the InDesign CS2 (and previous) method was not really compatible
    with what Windows does (which is not to say that it was wrong, it was just different)
    but Adobe at some point decided to match the Windows behavior. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Ralf, \r\n\r\nin a sense, the 3.0 Symbol cmap behavior is similar to the
    way applications and the OS treat Type 1 fonts -- they synthesize Unicode values
    from glyphnames. Different operating systems have different lists of \"known\"
    glyphnames. For example, Adobe applications and the Windows font driver \"know\"
    the glyphnames \"Ncommaaccent\", \"Ncedilla\" and \"uni0145\", and synthesize
    the codepoint U+0145 for each of them. But Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier does not
    understand the glyphname \"Ncommaaccent\" so it fails to synthesize a codepoint
    if it finds such a glyph -- but it does know \"Ncedilla\" and \"uni0145\". \r\n\r\nAlso,
    most OpenType fonts have two Unicode cmaps: 0.1 (\"Apple\" Unicode) and 3.1 (\"Microsoft\"
    Unicode). Windows always looks at the 3.1 cmap while Mac OS X looks at the 0.1
    cmap first, and if it does not fine one, at the 3.1 cmap. Font creation software
    would normally make sure that both cmaps have the same contents -- but it does
    not come naturally. Once can imagine fonts that (for whatever reasons) need to
    present different glyphs to Mac OS X and Windows, and then the font developer
    could make the cmaps different. In fact, I have made such fonts for a client.
    \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    isn't Unicode encoded, and PUA codepoints are, by definition, not standardised."
