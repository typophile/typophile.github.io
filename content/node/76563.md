  name is Glass Antiqua, it is from 1913.\r\nDo you know if there is a similar typeface
  which is digitized? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/glass-antiqua_4648.jpg]"

    I have this reference from the Taschen book \"Type. A Visual History of Typefaces
    & Graphic Styles, 1901-1938\" It's very inspiring!\r\n\r\nThanks anyway, I guess
    I have to trace myself then :)\r\n\r\n"
