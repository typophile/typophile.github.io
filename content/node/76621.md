  heritage building (it was the register)\r\nI'm fairly certain this is hand written
  but just wondering if this is based on something or is there something similar?\r\nI
  really love the W and the N's\r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated,\r\nGood night\r\n\r\nchillyphilli[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_4821.jpg]"
