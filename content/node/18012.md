    have lying around.

  body: "Yes, that's the one. Thanks, Lex.\r\n\r\nSorry, Patty. I guess it was naive
    of me but I actually did think that someone would know this off the top of her
    head. I even had a sample page on hand that I could have posted with my question,
    and I likely spent more time deciding not to post it than I would have spent posting
    it. In retrospect, I must have reasoned my assumption from the principle: <em>The
    object of my immediate concern must necessarily be the center of the universe
    for everyone</em>\u2026which is really just too embarrassing to think about. \r\n\r\nSheepishly,\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I'm afraid the title page is not going to be the best way to say what the
    book was set in. It looks to me like there is more than one typeface on the title
    page, and often titling faces are not the same as the text faces used inside the
    book. Do you  have a sample page with text, or were you asking what was on the
    title page?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
