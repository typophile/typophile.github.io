  some innovation, though \"Cr\xE9ative technologie\" removes the french accent out
  of the brand (on purpose?)... But I'm interested in finding out what is the corporate
  typeface, that seems to work very well with the logo's typeface and personality
  of the brand.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.citroen.fr\">www.citroen.fr</a>\r\n\r\nThanks."

    the chrome boomerangs ... It\u2019s all Landor\u2019s fault.\r\nI don\u2019t see
    how the new corporate face matches with the wordmark, the latter being a horrible
    constructed collection of letters."

    in the typeface used for copy, because, to be honest, it was the only thing that
    caught my attention. ;)\r\nThe only link is the rhythm of the curves in the N's
    and so on."

    \r\ni dont even think it is used in another context than in the logo..."
