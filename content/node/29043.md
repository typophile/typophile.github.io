  the 'x' and the 'z' are not done yet (along with lots of other things).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hmetalletters_4923.jpg]&nbsp;\r\nI've
  decided to design it as a font, so it can be used for posters, etc. There are no
  curves, just angles. I've attempted to create \"beefy\" stroke proportions that
  allude to low-grade machine pressing. To avoid a volksy look, the bottom and top
  angles are varied  to meet body centers at matching vertical points.\r\n\r\n1. Does
  this seem to fit the bill (metal, industrial)?\r\n2. Is it too similar to any common
  faces? \r\n3. Any ideas for the z, or references?\r\n\r\nI've been staring at it
  so long now that It's difficult to detach."

    body: "Thank you, H. This is completely gridded, indeed. Lowersd are are round
      12x48. Moving off the grid will be the last part of altering the outlines (easier
      to revise while they re still on one)I still have lots of spacing and such to
      go. In the end, when I am tweaking it,  I fear if I move off the grid too much,
      I'll get away from the mechanical tone and into a more \"natural\" feel. Any
      suggesstions on essential adjustments, while still avoiding the hand-drawn medievial
      look?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/figaro_5532.jpg]\r\n<em> think

  body: "Staying on the grid for reasons of speeding up development seems to make
    sense. On the other hand, it's very hard for a third-party to evaluate things
    this way, since he can't know what you <cite>intend</cite> to eventually tweak...\r\n\r\nConcerning
    mechanical versus natural, I would say that optical effects (like how the gap
    in the \"i\" looks splayed because the top of the tittle is at a different angle)
    cause strict adherence to the grid to actually result in irregular forms, more
    than it results in preventing naturalism. Ergo: some off-gridding is actually
    needed to make it look geometric.\r\n\r\nPress friendly at large sizes? I don't
    get it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The dots above I plan on, after removing the grid, moving the bottoms, so
    that the change in angle is averaged between the white space and the dot bottom.
    Likewise, I plan to do as subtle a tweaking to the interior hooks as possible
    to give it a slightly humane feel. While doing this, I'm sure I'll lightly move
    lots of points. Here's a rastered idea of the tuning.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gridfiddles_3416.jpg]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat
    I mean by press-friendly, is if there are any things to keep in mind when designing,
    to keep the similarities between laser printer/photocopy and running it on a photosetting
    machine as much as possible. I hear and see things about inktraps and such, and
    have experience with it in general design, but not at the glyph-design level.\r\n\r\nThe
    target date is early the 29th AM, for a flyer to go up that afternoon. I keep
    thinking of that old saying, You can get it fast, cheap and good, but you can't
    have all three.\" At least I know exactly which capitals and numbers I need. Meanwhile,
    my tablet's stylus is AWOL, and my keyboard is doing ...something strange. C'est

  body: "Well M. Cunninfham, If it helps, this makes me as uncomfortable to look at
    as heavy metal does to listen to. (we are not talking. here, about the original
    heavy metal bands, from which the music got its name, like Iron Butterfly or Led
    Zeppelin, or even later works such as the first [and seminal] Black Sabbath album,
    though Ozzie lost it after that, of course.... oh, sorry... off topic...).\r\n\r\nWhich
    is only to say that, well, I dont like it. But, you are not designing for my tastes.~
    \ As M. hrant notes, as a Logotype, possibly, but I wouldn't recommend it for
    the liner notes. I think that I might be tempted to offer this for the logo, but
    do a variation that was a lil more readable, if in fact they want a complete font
    for broader use.\r\n\r\nI recently came up with a lil rule of my own, as a result
    of a critique of a portion of a font which the reviewer otherwise liked. \"if
    ya dont recognize what the hell it is outside the context of the char set, it
    doesn't work\". By that standard, yes, the 'z' in this set needs attention, but
    the 'x' is worse. You obviously have worked out some rather rigid design principles
    and their application is pretty uniform, perhaps to the fonts detriment (I suppose
    this is what hrant means by \"too much grid). It might help to look to see where
    deviation from the norm would improve the overall look.\r\n\r\nIn the logo (i
    assume) the spacing that seems to work best is g/a. the r/g is far too wide. I
    would actually kern that pair. I think the logo works well, though getting that
    F/i to work is gonna be a mutha. You may have to overlap or go with a dotless
    'i'.\r\n\r\ngeo."

  body: "Great feedback, thanks. I've decided to split things into two versions, and
    allow myself more time for the body-copy oriented version. Then, later, I can
    reform them into one OT face. This way I can get the one for promotional work
    done. I'm glad the x and the z stand out as bad, I hate 'em, too. I will get back
    to those last, tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe grid-feel will be toned down lightly, and
    I have already corrected the spacing a good bit. Hadn't thought about the fi,
    since that's not in the band's name! Good point not sure what I will do tho'.
    Lots of work to go, th caps are designed but need extensive tuning due to lots
    of angeld crossbars appearing to stagger. Also, the caps are way to lurid for
    body text. All the responses here have been, if not positive, appropriate. I showed
    it to the bassist, she gave it the thumbs up as well.\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.exclamchine.com\">!Exclamachine

    thanks for the spacing feedback especiaally, I've been pushing letters back and
    forth, as the more traditional style of spacing the lettes just hasnt looked 'tough
    enough\"."
