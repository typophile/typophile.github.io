  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I wanted to create an elegant thin grotesque typeface for my own use and a collaborative project I'll be working on with a friend. I found some inspiration in Helvetica Ultra Light, Gotham, and Museo. I did try to combine the influences to create something with it's own unique characteristics hopefully (mostly in lowercase characters a,b,d,g,l,p,q,w).

I've noticed that some of the diacritics have rendered really poorly, but I haven't quite been able to figure out why (they are barely visible in the PDF, some not at all in the screenshot below, but they show up fine in FontLab)

I plan on expanding it to a  book, bold, and black weight, I just want work out the kinks in this weight first and fix the kerning (right now I've been manually adjusting in Illustrator)

		<div class="commentbody">That's avery nice typeface!
There are only two things that seem weird to me:
- in @, there a lot of space above the "a" and very little beneth it... This could be a problem in small sizes.
- lowercase q - I don't think it needs this sherif, it looks really weird to me. But that's just me:)
Keep up the good work!

But now b & q and p & d have the same shape (albeit rotated). 
Have you tried to place the hook at bottom of the p and at top of the q (which should create a nece pseudo ligature qu)?
Very nice work, by the way.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You've got this geometric thing going on with the caps, and it works well there. The uppercase reminds me vaguely of Neutraface. However, the lowercases are of two minds. Some of them are based off of what looks like a perfect ellipse (most of the round letters). Others, though, have a humanist feel in the round parts (ahmnu, and to a lesser extent fjltr). I think the letters would work better with each other if they all had the same feeling. If you go with the elliptical idea, I think the round parts could be slightly more square. The humanist curves seem, to me, to work better with the serifs you have on abdglpqt, but perhaps not as well with your caps, which are more geometric.

There are also some curves that look a bit rough to me: BJPRSU, stu, and possibly a (depending on which way you go). For the B, P, and R, I would suggest making your horizontal straightaways a little longer. The J and U need longer vertical straightaways.

I think it's fine that b & q and p & d have the same shape when rotated. They do in lots of fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the all the feedback. I've been thinking about how some of the lowercase characters relate to the uppercase. Here are some alternate options I came up with. I'm thinking the straight serifs would call for a full redesign of all the characters but maybe an option for another version of the typeface.

		<div class="commentbody">I was suggesting that the bowl of the g should look more like the bowl of the d--in your d, the stem stops the ellipse shape and makes it incomplete, and the g is the only letter where that ellipse is complete. 

I like the new serif structure in your latest set of letters, although I personally would leave the g with no serif (since all the other serifs are on the top left or bottom right of a letter). In the bowl shapes, though, I still see the clash that I was talking about before. If you drop a line from the top to the bottom extremum in your "o", it'll run vertically straight through your letter. If you stacked an "n" on top of a "u", though, and did the same thing, the line would run diagonal. That's what I'm trying to talk about.

Also, for the m and n I prefer the serif on the top left. I don't think the t needs a top serif.</div>
