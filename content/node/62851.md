    so dearly loved by Chinese restaurants. Some characters in display fonts remind
    me of some of the Indian scripts, although I think they may also be based on 60s
    LSD imagery. \r\n\r\n(Note: A discussion like this, that does not deal with Type
    Education, is best posted in the General Interest or Design forums, which get
    way more traffic. Maybe one of our sysops will move it.)"
