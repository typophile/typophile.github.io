  body: Good tip from Philippe, though. A few more rounded options listed <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/virtual/newsletters/mar2006_b">here</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/web-20-logos.cfm">here</a>.

  body: Unfortunately Mecanorma fonts lack any documentation and to be honest, I don't
    know if they are even an operating company anymore. God knows where those royalty
    checks end up. Maybe Steve Jackaman of ITF can tell us.
