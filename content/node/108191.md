body: "\r\n\r\nI am interested if anyone knows a font that is in any way similar to
  the One used on the words Liberty Bonds on the poster enclosed.\r\nI am designing
  a book cover for a book of First World War Nursery Rhymes. So I am looking for a
  font that is Chunky but also that has a bit of Child-like Character.  \r\nApproach\r\nAnother
  approach is to choose typography that was designed around the period of the first
  world war.\r\nGaramond and P22JohnstonUnderground come to mind, but they may be
  just a little too serious straight looking. \r\nImpact also comes to mind just because
  a lot of the hand-drawn posters were drawn in quite a blocky font.\r\nIf anyone
  has any views/suggestions please share.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a-1038-100_6489.jpg]"
