  but I think to something very simple and grid oriented.\r\nBut as (mainly) book
  and print designer I'm afraid to meddle a book-centered approach in my project.\r\nAny
  suggestion (of good legibility and good working platform)?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance\r\ncarlo"

  body: If you're at all interested in the inner workings of Web design, I would encourage
    you to bypass WordPress (for now). Instead, try to design and develop a simple,
    static site with Photoshop and HTML or XHTML and CSS. A good intro book that many
    people recommend is Sitepoint's [[http://www.sitepoint.com/books/html2/ | Build
    Your Own Web Site The Right Way Using HTML & CSS]].
