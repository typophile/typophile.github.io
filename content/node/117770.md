  identify a font from some letters spliced together from an album cover (The Repos

  remotely similar. Any help is appreciated!"

  body: "Dick, looks like the same font. My sample was from a typescript and looks
    heravier because of ink spread from the ribbon. Yours shows more detail, as if
    it was direct from an IBM catalog. Both demonstrate the difficulty of squeezing
    Old English capitals into a monospace format.\r\nDon"
