  sense to place it here. Additionally my apologies as I had previously posted this
  in the general discussion but it only collected dust there. If some one can explain
  how to take down my previous post I will.\r\n\r\nDose anyone know if Egmont Inline
  by Sjoerd Hendrik De Roos (S.H. de Roos), which was distributed by Typefoundry Amsterdam,
  was ever digitized? I believe that Linotype might have the rights to it but I can't
  find it on there website.\r\n\r\nI can't even find a highres sample of Egmont Inline
  online.\r\n\r\nAny high quality fonts that might be an adequate substitute?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n"

    may be as close as you get. there are many similars like Castellar, Academy Engraved,
    etc.'

  body: "\"Roos Initials may be as close as you get.\"\r\n\r\nAny idea why that would
    be? I can recollect seeing it as a font in the latter half of the eighties, (that
    is how I became aware of it) but I never had the need to use it until now over
    two decades later. I do not even have a type specimen of it. Only going by my
    memory of what it looked liked."

  body: Also, thank you for the suggestions defiantone but I think you failed to note
    that Egmont Inline had a thin inline and other than Roos Initials the other fonts
    you suggested do not. I thank you, however, for taking the time to make the suggestions.

  body: just saying, if you haven't found it you can try looking at similars. they
    may have made the one you're looking for but renamed it to something unfamiliar.
    if t hasn't been digitized you'll only find something similar. if it has there's
    no guarantee that it was done exactly like the sample you witnessed anyway. go
    to identifont.com and start searching, or keep referencing the info found like
    the below.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nsp_3539.png]

    clearly you are much better at tracking information trough the internet than I
    am.\r\n\r\nYou are correct, of corse, in that there is nothing wrong with the
    inline/engraved look on Roos Initials it is simply a matter of it not being correct
    for the specific purpose I need Egmont Inline for.\r\n\r\nThank you for all your
    help though."
