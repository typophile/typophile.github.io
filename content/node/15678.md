body: "Apologies to all and sundry if I missed an earlier thread in searching--but,
  to be honest, I'm not sure what I was searching for (Sunday typographer, etc.),
  so here goes:\r\n\r\nI am getting an odd character placement problem when using
  Scala (PS1) and Minion (OTF) in InDesign. Glyphs with counters, curved terminals,
  and crotches that touch the baseline (a, c, e, o; v, w) appear in print (ranging
  10-12 pts) to float off the baseline, as if being squeezed up by the serifs of the
  surrounding glyphs. There is no visible effect on the screen, but on the page it's
  a bit disconcerting. This appears to happen both with the font's metrics and InD's
  optical kerning activated. I am not such a greenhorn that I don't know that characters
  shift in kerning, but comparing my outputs to known good texts (like that of Bringhurst's
  <em>Elements</em>) does not make my output look good at all.\r\n\r\nI am using InD
  CS 3.0.1 on Tiger and printing to an HP LaserJet 1300 with the most recent drivers
  at maximum resolution (1200dpi).\r\n\r\nI'd attach a .pdf but, as I said, this problem
  appears only in hard copy. It all looks great on screen.\r\n\r\nPointers to earlier
  threads, questions about factors I didn't think to mention, or a fix would all be
  welcome. Maybe this is a printer issue, but I'd like to hear that from someone who
  knows what they're talking about (which is to say, not me). Thanks."

  body: Your description reminds me of a very old conflict (pre-OS X) that we used
    to have between Minion and Meta. We ended up re-buying Meta, and putting it in
    a folder labelled "for use with Minion." Surely a ghost that old still isn't lurking
    around? Unfortunately, we never did get to the bottom of the problem-- only to
    our work-around.

  body: "Thomas, \"B\":\r\n\r\nSorry--I'd given up on the thread!\r\n\r\n\"B\": I'm
    not using the fonts together; this happens with them being used separately. \r\n\r\nThomas:
    Doesn't seem to matter.\r\n\r\nThe effect is subtle but noticeable, and a little
    experimentation shows the same thing is happening with a number of my serif fonts
    (although it may be happening with the sans-serifs, too, and it's just not as
    noticeable). Not so much in TNR or the Garamond that ships with OS X, though.\r\n\r\nIs
    this perhaps a printer issue? The HP 1300 series is not native PS, and I don't
    even know how to make the 1300 emulate PS in OS X. Is my equipment the bottleneck?"

  body: "OK, some more experimentation: I am finding this effect in Word, too, and
    with every serif font I have tried (including that old standby, TNR). I would
    more closely describe the effect this way: that the system seems to want to place
    the very bottom of every character directly onto the baseline. On screen, everything
    look great; in print, things are jumbly. As I said, the effect is subtle but noticeable
    (and more so in fonts like Scala).\r\n\r\nYeesh. Can anyone suggest a test that
    would help me narrow down the problem? Maybe print a .pdf for me on their equipment
    to see if the effect really is local to my hardware?"

  body: "It's the printer. You're already getting their PostScript emulation, I imagine.
    Sorry for not picking up on the problem right away.\r\n\r\nAnother type designer
    wrote me about this quite a while ago, and he eventually figured out that at least
    certain versions of the HP clonescript misinterpret hinting blue zones, causing
    them to suppress overshoots at far too large a ppem size. That causes exactly
    the phenomenon you describe, with both Type 1 fonts and OpenType CFF fonts.\r\n\r\nYou
    can always try contacting HP and seeing if they have a ROM update or something.\r\n\r\n(Or
    buy an Adobe PostScript device.)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    body: "Thomas:\r\n\r\nThanks for getting back. I took the printer to work (where
      I'm stuck with a PC) and found the same thing happening, so I was reaching the
      same conclusion as you: either the printer, or the driver (which for a non-hacker
      like me amounts to the same thing). I've had this printer for about 2 years;
      leave it to the neophyte to take that long to notice the problem at more than
      a subconscious level (getting the feeling that my output quality was not up
      to snuff).\r\n\r\nI did see that the problem appeared to go away, or had less
      impact on the appearance of the type, at larger point sizes (14 to 16pt and
      up, rather than 10 to 12pt and smaller). This would be in line with the diagnosis
      you're suggesting, no? It's a pity that HP wouldn't have tried to deal with
      this in their 10.4 driver updates (or would that have been Apple's responsibility?).\r\n\r\nI'll
      give both your suggestions a try--HP now, a new printer after the holidays,
      bank account and the economy willing."
