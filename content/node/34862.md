body: "Typophile is made possible through the generosity of sponsors and efforts of
  volunteers, including time invested by us at Punchcut. We squeak time in on Typophile
  as often as we can without compromising client commitments.\r\n\r\nTypophile gets
  a lot of traffic. We're seeing about 200,000 unique visitors every month, with actual
  page \"hits\" coming in around 300,000 per day. Google likes us. 20,000 Typophile
  users are depending on us. So we don't take any site changes lightly.\r\n\r\nOn
  occasion we have to take the site down for maintenance upgrades. When we do, our
  general approach is to minimize downtime so that the community can keep moving,
  discussing and collaborating.  \r\n\r\nHowever, we can only test so much on our
  development server before pushing the release live to the public. There's no better
  test than unleashing thousands of simultaneous users (read as: ravenous type enthusiasts)
  on it. We really count on your goodwill during those times to pull together as a
  community to help us identify and squash bugs.\r\n\r\nWe've been down for a few
  days. A couple of the highlights from the recent downtime include:\r\n\r\n- Brand
  new server package with more processor power, RAM, disk space\r\n- Editing bug has
  been fixed.\r\n- A few Wiki bugs corrected\r\n- Comment RSS is back\r\n- Feedback/bugs
  form created\r\n\r\nHopefully, the most significant change you'll notice is a speed
  increase. If you find bugs, let us know. We're not promising a bug-free experience
  (yet). However <strong>do not post bug threads in the forums</strong>. Please direct
  feedback, comments, bugs here to our fancy new feedback form: http://www.typophile.com/feedback/\r\n\r\nThis
  new server package opens up lots of possibilities for Typophile, which will help
  us realize some goals we've had for the site for some time. Stick around, it's only
  going to get better.\r\n\r\nJared, Joe, Christian and Zara\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<em>Special
  thanks go out to all those who contributed donations to Typophile in the last few
  days. We've seen an outpouring of support from around the globe. We're extremely
  grateful for the vote of confidence. Thanks to your generosity, we will be able
  to cover several months of hosting for the site.\r\n\r\nIf you see any of these
  people online, be sure to thank them:\r\n\r\nRui Abreu\r\nMichael Albright\r\nSam

    if the membership thing would come up again soon. As a member, when the new program
    starts, will there be dues, or something like that?"

    package?\r\nOr just that there's barely anyone is on the forum right now. ;)\r\n\r\nAnyway:
    nice work."
