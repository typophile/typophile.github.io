  body: A font friend recently sent me copies of parts of it, to help me figure out
    if I should buy it or not. I haven&#39;t read much of it yet, but just so you
    know it seems to be more of an informal discussion type thing &#40;as opposed
    to something that addresses the techniques of design&#41;. So it&#39;s essentially
    more free-form and ideological than counterpunch, but of course anything that
    helps see inside the head of such a good designer is valuable. And it makes me
    want to write more. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I read already &#34;Type Now&#34;. I strongly recommend the book. You can
    agree or not with some of the Smeijers&#39;s statements, but the arguments are
    serius and solid.  <BR>My review will be published soon in &#34;Tipografica&#34;
    magazine &#40;I hope so... ha!&#41;  <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Something else: I realized this morning that my copies are the entire first
    section &#40;&#34;Type Now; a manifesto&#34;&#41; and none of the second part
    &#40;&#34;work so far&#34;, and more than half the book in pages&#41;. I assume
    the second part is an extensive type specimen. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
