body: "Here's the proposal so far. Tell me what's wrong with it. Please.\r\n\r\nFor
  Font Buyers:\r\n1.\tUnderstandable Licensing: all fonts licensed through iLUVfonts.com
  for traditional \u201Cprint-based\u201D projects will be subject to a Creative Commons
  Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 End User Licensing Agreement. Period.\r\n2.\tAll fonts
  distributed through iLUVfonts.com will be digitally signed and certified virus-free.\r\n3.\tAll
  fonts distributed through iLUVfonts.com will carry a unique serial number, to safeguard
  your purchase against unauthorized piracy.\r\n4.\tForever Font Insurance: for a
  nominal fee, each font license through iLUVfonts.com will carry a lifetime, free
  upgrade option. Any revisions to the content or form\u2014at any future date, until
  you drop dead\u2014of any iLUVfonts font will be free to insured buyers, who will
  receive email notification of such upgrades, and a special download code for fulfillment.\r\n5.\tIn
  an effort to keep Customer Service costs down, all fonts licensed through iLUVfonts.com
  will be sold as-is, no refunds and no exchanges, and no exceptions. If a bona fide
  technical flaw exists in sold fonts, buyers will receive a free upgrade, whether
  or not they participate on the Forever Fonts Insurance program.\r\n\r\nEmbedding
  Rights\r\n1.\tWebfont distribution will be handled by a selected partner exclusively,
  who will handle all licensing, distribution and billing issues.\r\n2.\tEmbedding
  in electronic documents and videogames will follow a simple percentage-of-retail-price
  formula, the amount of which will be determined by forecast gross sales figures.
  \ Licensing fees will be paid to Licensor at each individual point of sale. No perpetual
  licenses will be issued, nor will global rights be assigned under any cisrumstances,\r\n3.\tUntil
  Apple makes its App codebase less susceptible to hacking, requests for embedding
  fonts in any Bezier format within App Store apps will be respectfully denied.\r\n\r\nFor
  Vendors of Customized Products\r\n1.\tVendors who provide customized products may
  access the complete iLUVfonts catalog via a special plug-in to the vendor\u2019s
  website. For a single, flat, reasonable one-time fee, the vendor\u2019s customers
  may use selected fonts in their projects, whether or not it is a single-word headline
  or extensive text for a hard-copy document. Furthermore, vendors and their customers
  will have access to a comprehensive collection of graphic elements, available for
  one-time licensing at a very attractive price.\r\n\r\nFor Educational Institutions\r\n1.\tSpecial
  Promotional Rates for enrolled students, access to online resources to support learning,
  and an opportunity for students to engage in real-world projects by designing specimen
  sheets for any product in the font catalog. \u201CWinning\u201D entries, determined
  by a majority of peers, will appear on the iLUVfonts website, with full credit given
  to the winners.\r\n\r\nFor Sellers of Fonts.\r\n1.\tLow Overhead: all commissions,
  fees and accounting charges will be limited to no more than 25% of each sale and,
  ideally, substantially less. In return, vendors will be responsible for all content
  creation to support their sales through a template-based CMS system.\r\n2.\tAccess
  to Digital Signature, Unique Serial Number and Forever Font Insurance Protection
  at no additional cost to vendor.\r\n3.\tFlexible Payment Options: choose either
  Immediate Payment at Point of Sale, or 30-day Carryover Plan. Immediate Payment
  Plan users will be subject to the access fee charged by our payment processor, but
  will have full access to their funds as they accrue. The 30-day Carryover Plan will
  eliminate this fee, and funds will be transferred to vendor\u2019s bank account
  every thirty days, within five days of the close of each month. If the amount being
  carried over globally meets certain thresholds, Carryover Plan participants may
  opt into an insured Money Market plan, administered by an independent, accredited
  investment firm, which will allow investors to make a return their Carryover funds.\r\n4.\tOrganic
  Evolution: as traffic grows, additional incentives to customers will be added, including
  but not limited to discussion forums, a TypoWiki, online specimen book library,
  and Webinars, featuring video interviews with noted luminaries in the fields of
  typography, graphic design, and so forth.\r\n"

  body: "I think you linked to the wrong licence, this should be the right one: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\r\n\r\nThis
    kind of licence effectively makes the fonts free to share and modify, which is
    a bit of a contradiction to the digital signature and personalized serial number
    stuff, it seems to me.\r\n\r\nOne more thing to ponder: Do the \"attribution\"
    and \"share alike\" requirements of the CC licence apply only to the fonts themselves,
    or also to works created using the fonts?"

  body: "Jens\u2014\r\n\r\nThanks for correcting the link.\r\n\r\nAs I read the license,
    the ORIGINAL COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL\u2014i.e., the font itself\u2014is still protected
    and cannot be copied or redistributed except by specific waiver in writing from
    the creator of the font...\r\n\r\n<em>4.c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform
    the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
    made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
    and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name
    of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
    Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\")
    in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means,
    the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii)
    to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies
    to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
    notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection
    3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
    the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or
    \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required
    by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
    that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
    appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as
    the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
    may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
    You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship
    or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
    written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>4.d
    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted
    by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either
    by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
    mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which
    would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees
    that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
    in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed
    to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial
    to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable
    national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b)
    of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.</em>\r\n\r\nIn
    other words\u2026\r\n\r\nIf someone uses one of my fonts to create a logotype,
    then the author of the logotype owns the rights to the logotype, but not the font
    used to create it\u2014or, at least, that's the way that I read the license. If
    you know of a better one, please let me know. All I was looking for was a COMMON
    standard that iLUVfonts buyers could rely on, instead of all of this silly shit
    with mod-no mod..."

    it and offer it for free on a different website. All who download it from this
    website will get the same serial number.\r\n\r\nAnd as spiral mentioned: \u201CAttribution\u201D
    requires an attribution every time the font is used. This would even include a
    logotype. \r\n\r\nTo put it simple: Those CC licenses are not really suitable
    for fonts \u2026"
