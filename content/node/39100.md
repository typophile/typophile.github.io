body: "I'm trying to successfully implement kerning pairs, and possibly classes in
  an Open Type font file in Fontlab 5.\r\n\r\nAfter reading a few threads regarding
  Open Type Pairs and Classes I learned of the glitch requiring another 'feature'
  to be created to have Open Type Pairs export correctly and show up in the final
  font file.\r\n\r\nWithout much experience on the technical side of Open Type I did
  a quick cut and paste of\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\nsub f i by fi;\r\nsub f l by fl;\r\n}
  liga;\r\n\r\nvia Twardoch's suggestion and this worked rather easily as the results
  are shown while working in the opentype features panel\u2026 (I havent successfully
  exported and tested the font yet as I havent completed the kerning pairs but assume
  all is well) \r\n\r\nI was curious how to successively add the rest of the remaining
  ligatures and it seems as easy as\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\nsub f i by fi;\r\nsub
  f l by fl;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\nsub a e by ae;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\njust
  adding a return and successively adding each ligature but I have four distinct questions:\r\n\r\n1.
  Is the above way correct for adding numerous ligatures to just hit return and keep
  adding code to cover all possible ligatures?\r\n\r\n2. Is there a more thorough
  manual or book for learning Open Type advanced features for someone who is more
  focused on the creative and design side of typography, basically something not long
  winded more of a visual learning guide?\r\n\r\n3. What are the most desired features
  of Open Type, I'm assuming the ligature feature is one of them. Are there any other
  Open Type features that are as simple as the above ligature example?\r\n\r\n4. What
  I've read regarding classes in Open Type seems complicated, pairs seem much easier,
  is there a clear and simplified guide to creating classes?\r\n\r\nI do realize that
  there are designers for hire that can help implement advanced  features for Open
  Type such as randomize code and etc\u2026 but for myself I'd like to learn and do
  as much as possible myself\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: "I try to answer some of your questions:\r\n\r\n1. You dont have to hit return
    and type the feature again on each new ligature. Just put all of your ligatures
    inside the the two brackets, like this:\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\n  sub f f b by
    f_f_b;\r\n  sub f f h by f_f_h;\r\n  sub f f i by ffi;\r\n  sub f f j by f_f_j;\r\n
    \ sub f f k by f_f_k;\r\n  sub f f l by ffl;\r\n  sub f b by f_b;\r\n  sub f f
    by ff;\r\n  sub f h by f_h;\r\n  sub f i by fi;\r\n  sub f j by f_j;\r\n  sub
    f k by f_k;\r\n  sub f l by fl;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\n2. Asking questions here is
    good \u2013 I have learned a lot, it also good to read the FL manual. These things
    are very hard to understand in the beginning I believe, but go on and try, some
    day the sun is shining :)\r\n\r\n3. I think all features is quite easy to learn,
    everything is about substitution, for instance \u2013 here are a few popular:\r\n\r\nSwash
    letters:\r\nfeature swsh {\r\n  sub @swsh1 by @swsh2;\r\n} swsh;\r\n\r\nSmall
    Caps:\r\nfeature smcp {\r\n  sub @smcp1 by @smcp2;\r\n  sub @smallnumerals1 by
    @smallnumerals2;\r\n  sub @currency1 by @currency2;\r\n  sub @punctuation1 by
    @punctuation2;\r\n} smcp;\r\n\r\nOld Style Figures:\r\nfeature onum {\r\n  sub
    @onum1 by @onum2;\r\n  sub @currency1 by @currency2;\r\n} onum;\r\n\r\n\r\nIn
    these cases, there are classes made first with all the necessary glyphs. One class
    for the original letters, and one for the glyphs that are supposed to substitute
    the former ones. I usually name the classes 1 and 2 \u2013 the 2 substitutes the
    1. The classes must be built so the order and number of glyphs are the same in
    both classes.\r\n\r\nAs an example:\r\n\r\nonum1 = one two three\r\nonum2 = one.oldstyle
    two.oldstyle three-oldstyle\r\n\r\nWe also have:\r\n\r\nDiscretionary Ligatures:\r\n\r\nfeature
    dlig {\r\n  sub c t by c_t;\r\n  sub s t by s_t;\r\n  sub s p by s_p;\r\n} dlig;\r\n\r\n\r\n4.
    What to do you mean by \"pairs\"? Kerning pairs? Classes is very handy because
    it saves time. For instance, you make a class where the key glyph is \"o\" \u2013
    you can then use this class to kern letters like e c d b p q as an example, not
    to mention the time you save for all the accented letters that is build on \"o\"
    \u2013 like \xF6 \xF8 \xF3 \xF2 etc.\r\n\r\nIf you do a search here, you will
    find more detailed information on this.\r\n\r\nYoure welcome with any follow-up
    question you might have \u2013 someone will help you :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Goran,\r\n\r\nThanks this information is great\u2026 its somewhat difficult
    but I'm learning quick.\r\n\r\nWhere could I find a list of ligature language,
    meaning a list that shows that 'fi' only has to be typed as 'fi' whereas 'fj'
    needs an underscore like 'f_j' and etc?\r\n\r\nYes, by pairs I meant 'kerning
    pairs', I have handled pairs successfully in the past but Classes seem a bit more
    complex maybe because it has the left and right side, I understand it but need
    to implement it and go through the process to get a handle on how it works better.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again\r\n\r\nMike"

      is for like onesuperior and onehalf like one.fraction.two or whatever.

  body: "Basically, all ligatures that does not have its own unicode number, should
    be written with underscore. So if you make your own ligatures that are not standard
    ligatures, put the underscore there.\r\nThe underscore also makes the ligatures
    \"break apart\" if you kern them, and the underscore also means that InDesign
    treat them as their original letters, so f_f_j will be ffj if you switch to a
    font that does not have this ligature, or if you copy paste text. That is a good
    thing.\r\n\r\nI think the only ligatures that has unicode number these:\r\n\r\nff\r\nfi\r\nffi\r\nfl\r\nffl\r\nRegarding
    classes, there are three types of classes in FontLab \u2013 kerning classes, metrics
    classe and OT classes. Think of them as groups of glyphs for that is what they
    are, nothing more. Groups to make things more easy to handle. In kerning classes,
    they are groups of glyphs that have some similiarities.\r\nI dont understand your
    second question with the syntax?"

  body: "Thanks again Goran the second question I mean is what the syntax is for fractions,
    I'm sure I'm not wording this all right but if for ligatures there is\r\n\r\nfeature
    liga {\r\nsub f i by fi;\r\nsub f l by fl;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nthen is there a list
    of syntax for fractions or substitions so that if you type 1/2 or 1/4 it converts
    that into the actual corresponding fraction glyph it would be helpful if there
    was a txt file that showed the syntax (is that what its called?)\r\n\r\nThanks
    for bearing with these questions I'm learning fast since yesterday I've implemented
    ligatures, classes successfully and plan to do the same with fractions and alternates
    for another font I'm finalizing\u2026 hopefully this thread will help others as
    well\u2026\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: "Examples for proper syntax for the features come with the FontLab. For example,
    I use a Windows platform; the directory\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files\\FontLab\\Studio5\\Samples\r\n\r\nis
    installed when I install the program.\r\n\r\nOne of the files you will see there
    is\r\n\r\nfreefontpro.fea\r\n\r\nWhich gives useful examples for writing the features
    code.\r\n\r\nOne thing to remember is that writing features depends to some extent
    on both a knowledge of the use of type, and the features a particular applications
    program will use. If, for example, you use InDesign, only those OpenType features
    InDesign supports are worth writing.\r\n\r\nYou can also write features (code)
    that most would consider a hack; for example, search for \"fractions\" on this
    forum to find a thread where fractions are, essentially, \"always on\" rather
    than selected & the feature applied. Makes sense for cookbooks; but is wrong for
    most  text.\r\n\r\nI would note that using Type 1 fonts, a layout engine like
    TeX (where you could use different encoding vectors essentially on the fly), and
    a preprocessing program for the text stream (search & replace strings including
    S&R using regular expressions) gave results essentially similar to OpenType and
    its features. The real plus is that OpenType supports Unicode, so further uses
    of a document are far easier than when the glyphs were known only by their *name*.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the bug that requires a substitution string in order for positioning strings to
    be applied is an bug with applications programs, not in FontLab or OpenType. I
    am sure Adobe will fix it in future releases of their programs."

  body: "An example. You have defined these OpenType classes in your FLS Classes Panel:\r\n\r\nNUMERALS:
    zero one two three four five six seven eight nine\r\nNUMERATORS: zero.numr one.numr
    two.numr three.numr four.numr five.numr six.numr seven.numr eight.numr nine.numr\r\nDENOMINATORS:
    zero.dnom one.dnom two.dnom three.dnom four.dnom five.dnom six.dnom seven.dnom
    eight.dnom nine.dnom\r\n\r\nA simple 'frac' feature then looks like this (the
    idea was first introduced by John Hudson, I think):\r\n\r\nfeature frac {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    slash by fraction;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub @NUMERALS by @NUMERATORS;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    [fraction @DENOMINATORS] @NUMERATORS' by @DENOMINATORS;\r\n} frac;\r\n\r\nWhich
    means:\r\n-- first you replace 'slash' by 'fraction'\r\n-- and all numerals by
    numerator numerals\r\n-- finally you replace all numerators by denominators --
    but only if they follow either the 'fraction' or another denominator! (The quote
    sign in @NUMERATORS' indicates that only glyphs of this class are to be substituted,
    the other glyphs, here enclosed in brackets, are the context which must be met
    so that the substitution takes place.)\r\n\r\nThis feature then should precede
    all other numeral-related features like 'sups', 'subs', 'sinf', 'numr', 'dnom'.\r\n\r\nDon't
    just copy/paste but play with it and try to understand what is going on. For example,
    kick out the context part \"[fraction @DENOMINATORS]\", or only the \"fraction\"
    or only the \"@DENOMINATORS\", out of the code and check what happens!&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\r\n\r\nBtw,
    there's no need for covering 'percent' and 'perthousand' in the frac feature,
    as in some older examples!\r\n\r\nUse of the feature: Select the glyphs that shall
    become a fraction and apply this feature. It should not be applied to entire paragraphs.
    For a discussion of the latter (and its disadvantages) see <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/38448\"
    target=\"_blank\">this thread</a>.\r\n\r\nHope there's no error or typo left ...\r\n\r\n"
