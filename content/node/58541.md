  this is my first attempt, and also my first post here, so if my work is appalling

  is a great opportunity for me to share this logo with you, I really appreciate any

  body: "I'm guessing this is a store with kid's stuff. But if it's a \"fancy dress\"
    store I don't understand the use of a kid with a baseball hat and wings. And what
    does the exclamation mark on the shirt stand for? \r\n\r\nThere's a number of
    technical concerns, you have a lot of gradients, which may not reproduce well
    depending upon usage. \r\n\r\nI think you need to outline the project more. Does
    \"fancy dress\" mean elegant party/wedding/christening clothes for children? or
    is it more of a party supply store that sells balloons and party favors? How will
    the logo be used? on signs? on the web? on business cards? Will it ever need to
    be in one color?\r\n\r\nThere's concerns regarding your type selection and kerning,
    but until the real nature of the store is better understood it's not even something
    to delve into yet.\r\n\r\nI think you should go back to square one. Determine
    what is the image the store wants to convey. Then start by doing sketches on paper.
    Work on the concept and composition before diving in with the gradient tool. I
    hope I don't sound harsh but it seems like you put the cart before the horse and
    need iron out the concept first."

  body: "Thanks for your comments.\r\n\r\nThe person in the logo was intended to be
    a member of staff.. someone who is a bit fun wearing the products and holding
    balloons. the logo originally was an exclamation mark, and therefore that on the
    shirt is the logo, and the cap part of the uniform (the concept is obviously lost
    here I can see).\r\n\r\nThe store is for adults as much as it is children, supplying
    to hen nights, new years eve, halloween, as well as kids dress up, and party decorations
    and balloons. Its very hard to come up with something that suggests all this.\r\n\r\nSo
    generally speaking, should I be designing a logo in black and white first? And
    only once this works add colour?\r\n\r\nIf I made it more obvious the character
    was a member of staff, does this idea sound good to anyone?\r\n\r\nThanks again
    for any comments..."

    be the emphasis of the design. You may however want to make the smile stand out
    more and use more distinct colors for the various segments.  \r\n\r\nThe \"just
    for fun\" font isn't working IMO. (Kerning is bad, lowercase \"s\" looks weird)
    \ I suggest you try some other typefaces and choose a color that stands out more
    from the character.  Purple?"

  body: "(Kirsten: \"fancy dress\" is England English for \"costume party\".)\r\n\r\nAssuming
    you're going to keep working with what you have, I'd make the main letterspacing
    much tighter, and replace the secondary type with a typeface that matches or harmonizes
    in some way with the main type. The image is probably a bit too cluttered with
    stuff, and I realize it's very hard to see \"simplicity\" and \"wackiness\" going
    hand in hand, but it's something to try to keep in mind as you explore ideas."

  body: That first one is better! For compositional balance, try moving the mark to
    the left side, maybe with an orange horizontal line all the way across that suggests
    a countertop (which would help the idea that this is one of the staff).

  body: "I'm not convinced about this. The colours are fun but I think it should work
    in one colour too, so perhaps it'd be best to start with a solid concept in black
    and white before adding the sparkle. \r\nA couple of ideas: have the letters of
    the text somehow suggesting fancy dress. You could put different kinds of costume
    on different letters...I'm thinking horns, antenna, flares, wigs and ra-ra skirts.
    That would be pretty hard to draw onto a font successfully but could look totally
    unique. Or use letters from different fonts, in different colours e.g. a horror
    font dripping red blood for one letter, a fuzzy bee in yellow and black for another
    letter, put them all together and you don't need a separate icon.\r\nOr, since
    it's a place for party outfits, I'm thinking a set of people in silhouette having
    fun in different costumes, kids and adults, monsters and vampires, dancing or
    jumping. Then have the text below. \r\nTo me, the one person in the logo looks
    a bit lonely...balloons and a smile don't quite make a party.\r\nSorry, I don't
    like the type at all, I'd find something much more dynamic and properly spaced.
    I think you're on the right track with the round terminals but there are plenty
    of better alternatives out there.\r\nHope that's helpful :)"

    the type.  I haven't found a proper alternative to Chalet but I'm sure you have
    a bunch of other fonts on your computer that would work.  Otherwise there's always

  body: Just want to add the "s" in "just" looks really bothersome. It looks like
    a "u" collapsed side way. I would also get rid of the smile...I can hardly tell
    it's there & I don't think it enhances the logo much.
