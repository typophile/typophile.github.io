  body: 'If you want to know the font, go with: "The latest activity" sans with no
    idea. That should work.'

  body: I thought it was Neo Sans Medium, but now I don't think it is. The bottom
    of the lowercase d looks different, as does the y.

  body: "BTW What Tomi meant is that you should make your thread title a little more
    descriptive, something like:\r\n\u201CThe latest activity\u201D sans with no idea\r\n\r\nIt
    is very hard for us to distinguish the different requests if they all have titles
    like \"Font\", \"Please help me\", \"What is this font\", Type ID\", and so on.
    It's as if we were trying to read a newspaper and every headline shouted \"Stuff
    happened!\" ;^)"
