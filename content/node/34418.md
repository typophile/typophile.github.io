  looking for a typeface that can be recognizable as the handwriting of Ren\xE9 Magrite
  on the painting \"Ceci n\u2019pas une pipe\". It should be as similar as possible
  to the one on the painting.\r\n\r\nDo you think you can help me with some suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot in advance.\r\n"

    which could be modified to come very close to Magrite's script."

    some adjustments!\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve already tried to draw it by hand, but as I
    need diferent characters to write a diferent sentence, I felt I needed a typeface.
    It should also be neat, because it will work with a vectorized image.\r\n"

    use it in an Adobe application or Quark--it has many alternate letterforms for
    the lower case, that work in the Contextual Alternates feature, or via the glyph
    palette. '
