  body: Have you seen any other examples of this?  <BR> <BR>It somewhat resembles
    Jason Walcott&#39;s <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg9.html" target="_blank">Luxury
    Royale</a> &#40;top of page&#41;. It also seems to have a custom or swash &#39;k&#39;.
    I&#39;ve looked through Parts 7 &amp; 8 in my Script Font ID Guide and it doesn&#39;t
    seem to be anything I have collected so far, so I&#39;ll be wanting to get a sample
    if someone ID&#39;s this one.

  body: It could be custom, I can almost see small differences betwen the &#34;e&#34;
    and the &#34;r&#34;.

  body: For more samples, go to <a href="http://www.ae.com" target="_blank">www.ae.com</a>,
    the website for the clothing retailer. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s a beautiful script,
    but I would love to know if it&#39;s either hand-drawn or an actual font. <BR>
    <BR>Anymore info would be great guys!

  body: I didn&#39;t see any more samples. I did see the same logo repeated. This
    suggests that this is just an image of some hand-drawn lettering. <BR> <BR>I also
    had Ignacio&#39;s feeling that those letters weren&#39;t exact duplicates.
