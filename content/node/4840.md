    <BR> <BR>Unica is amazing. The only grot I like - although some people don&#39;t
    think it&#39;s a grot - which would explain my attraction! <BR>It avoids both
    the sterility of Univers and the... well, idiocy, of Helvetica. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    Gurtler also authored the only Egyptian I like: the 505. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    other grots?

  body: Dunno - maybe a bad reason... or two. Part of it is Gurtler&#39;s mystique.
    Another is the amazing &#34;rationalization&#34; exercise Team 77 carried out
    in making it &#40;elaborated just as amazingly in a small publication I have a
    copy of&#41;. I guess the main reason I can cling to is that it&#39;s not &#34;naive&#34;.
    Most old grots &#40;like Akzidenz&#41; are like backwards villagers to me, and
    new grots &#40;like FF Bau&#41; are urbanites <i>pretending</i> to be villagers.
    In comparison, Unica is like an urbanite who has had to move in with his villager
    in-laws, but has decided to make the best of it. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I
    suspect this is exactly why some people think Unica is not in fact a grot - it&#39;s
    a geo in grot&#39;s clothing. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    Digital Type Collection (which included Haas Unica) was purchased by Elsner +
    Flake in 2003, to which they added font-specific Euro and @ symbols in 2004. The
    revamped typeface was set to be sold by Scangraphic and its distributors, but
    Linotype is currently preventing the release, citing trademark violations. Although
    similarities to other typefaces often occur between foundries, it is rare that
    one finds typefaces that have been shelved indefinitely due to such resemblances.
    In truth, the real problem lies within a dispute over who owns the name Haas Unica,
    rather than any resemblance infringment.</blockquote>"

  body: "> I\u2019m quite sure that those have been transferred either to Linotype
    GmbH or to their new owner Monotype Imaging \r\n\r\nIf this were true, then Monotype
    would have registered the new ownership. What is more, Monotype would have been
    under obligation to register the new ownership, because only the owner registered
    as the owner of the trademark is the owner of the trademark. And this registered
    owner is Heidelberger Druckmaschinen, which also made a more recent registration
    for the trademark \"Hass\" for entire Europe:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/haas2.gif\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    someone else registered \"Haas Grotesk\":\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/haas3.gif\r\n\r\nAt
    the Linotype and the Monotype website, e.g. here\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/helvetica.gif\r\n\r\nit
    is claimed:\r\n\r\n\"Helvetica is a trademark of Linotype Corp. registered in
    the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and may be registered in certain other jurisdictions
    in the name of Linotype Corp. or its licensee Linotype GmbH.\"\r\n\r\nBut this
    is not true.\r\n\r\nHelvetica is a trademark of Heidelberger registered in the
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The managers of Monotype are able to see this
    at the website of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, namely here\r\n\r\nsee
    http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/helvetica2.gif\r\n\r\nso that it is apparent
    that the managers of Monotype make intentionally false statements at the Monotype
    website.\r\n\r\nWhile Monotype registered several \"crap fonts\", e.g. \"Basic
    Commercial\",\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/basic.gif\r\n\r\nthe
    important trademarks, e.g. for Helvetica, are still registered for Heidelberger
    Druckmaschinen AG at the U.S. Trademark Office.\r\n\r\nAnd in Germany as well
    as in entire Europe, Helvetica is also registered for Heidelberger Druckmaschinen
    only, not for Monotype nor for Linotype:\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/helvetica3.gif\r\n\r\nThe
    Monotype managers are mentally capable of seeing this. Therefore it is ricidulous
    that they deceive buyers about the trademark registration at the Monotype website.\r\n\r\nAt
    the Monotype subsite\r\n\r\nhttp://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/trademarks.aspx\r\n\r\napparently
    most \"Linotype Corp.\" trademark statements, such as e.g.\r\n\r\n\"Aldus\" is
    a trademark of Linotype Corp. registered in the United States Patent and Trademark
    Office...\r\n\r\nare false, as you can see for yourself by checking the website
    of the US Trademark Office here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.uspto.gov/main/trademarks.htm\r\n"
