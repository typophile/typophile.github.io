  body: "Got no hits when I searched on the image as provided.\r\n\r\nI suspected
    that it may actually be an italic script that someone \u201Cstraightened\u201D
    to make an upright script. When I skewed the sample, I found a match for the |G|
    and |C| in Champignon Alt Swash (but Champignon doesn\u2019t appear to be a match
    to the rest of the letters):\r\nhttp://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-2%20%2F%20%28Freemium%29&ffam=Champignon%20Alt%20Swash%20-%20Regular&fstyle=&fsize=60&fid=dc55e1af7f871a21244226fe99746aee&wrap=2&text=GC\r\n\r\nIf
    your sample predates the digital era, there may by no digital equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Good find for seeing _G_ and _C_ as being from Campignon Alt Swash modified
    to an upright version. \r\nThese letters are found as alts in the otf version
    of Campignon. \r\nThe other letters are also in the otf version of Campignon.
    \r\nConsider:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CampignonModified1_4176.jpg]\r\nI
    sloped all letters 36 degrees left except for the _C_ which I sloped 24 degrees.
    The _r_ and _k_ are alts.\r\nSome minor tinkering and there would be an exact
    match.\r\nBTW this font is a good exemplar of the fine work that Claude Pelletier
    does in creating digital fonts.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Excellent work, Don.\r\n\r\nI made another ID here some months back that
    was stumping me and everyone else, until I realized that the angle of the typeface
    had been messed with. Thought the same thing might be at work here.\r\n\r\nI should
    have downloaded Champignon and explored it further....."

  body: "Thanks Kevin.\r\nI have learned to be suspicious of vertical script images.\r\nThey
    are usually somewhat off in terms of what would look best if the script was designed
    from scratch as a vertical script.\r\nAfter you targeted the _G_ and _C_ I couldn't
    resist exploring the rest of the font.\r\nDon"
