  body: "Some random thoughts.\r\nColours don\u2019t blend well together: the \u201Cim\u201D
    blue is too bright.\r\nGrey on grey, seriously?\r\nShape-wise, \u201Cim\u201D
    stands out too much, while online.eu is too uniform. If the intent is to promote
    the url, \u201Cim\u201D shouldn\u2019t appear as something separate. If the intent
    is to promote the brand, \u201Cim\u201D and \u201Conline\u201D should work better
    together while .eu should be de-emphasised."

  body: "on a first glance: I'd probably strip down on the colors. You've got a fully
    blue first two letters (IM), then you get online with a blue to blue gradient,
    and then you get the grey .eu . It seems to me that it was done randomly. \r\n\r\nedit:
    there was a very long story above, but to get to the core: I agree with riccard0.\r\n\r\nWhen
    looking at the webpage I think there are to(o?) many different shades of blue
    incorporated. same goes for the fonts. There is a clearly distuingishable difference
    between webfonts and normal typography, and although webfonts / -typography can
    be treated like normal typography for a great deal with css, and other tricks,
    keep in mind that not everything works like normal typography. (Like the IM for
    Sole Traders)"

  body: It may just be the size of the image but the character spacing appears a bit
    off. I think the disconnect between the script m and sans o is too wide. Also
    the round o and e in online appear slightly offset from the more uniformly spaced
    nlin.

  body: "wow - gold already - im gonna pass on the comment to my guy and see what
    he has to say - \r\n\r\nThis is all good stuff - \r\n\r\nThis is really not my
    style and I wouldn't have approached it like this - \r\nI think this is what happens
    when web developer opens photoshop.\r\n\r\nIll have a chat with the creator and
    see what the options are - \r\n\r\nKeep it coming - if there is anything else
    I am keen to hear your thoughts - \r\n\r\nCheers Guys"

  body: I don't really see "i'm online" with this, I see "i squiqqle squiggle online".
    Agreed on the color thoughts as well, in general it just comes off as a "this
    is what I figured out in ten minutes" logo.

  body: "It's weak in a sense that it is hardly memorable at all. As someone said
    in another thread, it looks like it was put together in 15 seconds in MS Paint.
    It is unremarkable and lacks any kind of \"AHA moment\".\r\n\r\nSecondly, is it
    IM or I'M ? Technically IM is Instant Messaging, especially if it's an \"online\"
    context.\r\n\r\nIf you are set on using just the typography, I'd probably stick
    with a single typeface, heavier than you use currently and then just play with
    a letter decoration to make the logo stand out a bit more."

  body: Aside from what everyone else has said, I feel that it is somewhat cold and
    uninviting. This is probably due to a combination of the font and color choices.
    I would steer clear of geometric sans faces in this case. Maybe something more
    humanistic in style. As for the script, I understand the effect he was going for,
    but I think that face is too angular to be friendly. If this is supposed to be
    for a website that makes it easy for the average user to create visually appealing
    websites, I feel like the logo should be warmer, friendlier and more inviting.
    I can picture this on some type of store-brand cosmetics product.
