    Caslon (Semibold?) Italic</a> with swashes.\r\nNice! (Though the \u2018o\u2019
    in \u2018Patton\u2019 really is weird.)\r\n\r\nF"

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nHad a look at the glyphs and that's really a customised version!
    Very well done.\r\nJust the small fact that the \u2018t\u2019 in \u2018Stian\u2019
    and the \u2018t\u2019 in \u2018Patton\u2019 are way different but works very well
    \u2013 both of them.\r\n\r\nAgreed on the \u2018o\u2019. It looks like its not
    even Italic?\r\n"
