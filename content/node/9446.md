  body: Just for the future, in using the Script Guide, that style would be considered
    to be in Part 7 &#40;Casual Flowing Script&#41;, and it was on the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">first page</a>.

  body: I was looking at the Formal Flowing Scripts, because it looked to me like
    Commercial Script ... <BR>Will be more careful next time <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: What you chose was really a reasonable choice, since Eclat does have a regular,
    somewhat formal &#39;feel&#39;, but my thinking about the categories was that
    the Formal Scripts were like the ones you would see on formal stationery. I couldn&#39;t
    see Eclat being used that way, so I put it in Part 7. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t mean
    to sound critical, just wanted to help clarify how I categorized  the scripts.
