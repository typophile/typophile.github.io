  body: Looks like Frutiger Black, manually condensed (or to use the technical term,
    squooshed).

  body: I thought Frutiger, but the space from the bottom of the P to the intersection
    of the P (if that's the term) seems longer, even if I squoosh it. But maybe it
    is Frutiger Next or something like that.
