  many faces, it could be 5 faces or 100. Just pick your favorite 'workhorse' faces.

    I'll most certainly skoff at in the not too distant future. I look back on work
    that I did 5 years ago and wonder what I was thinking when I picked some of the
    faces I used. (Be it financial limitations, skill or understanding.)\r\n\r\nSo,
    I'll go with a few that I enjoy using more often than others (as of late):\r\n\r\n1.
    Meta\r\n2. Emigre's Brothers\r\n3. Helvetica\r\n4. Myriad Pro\r\n5. Farnham\r\n\r\nI
    don't use very many serifed fonts. Mainly because I don't feel confident in picking
    them."

  body: "When selecting a font for a particular job I consider the type of reproduction
    process and most importantly the substrate to printed on. Of course legibility
    and subject matter is also important to me when considering a type family.\r\nI
    guess the old factors of considering masculine, femine or neutral types are out
    the window, unless you march in a parade."

  body: "In general I'm down on the classics, but have to admit that I've used them
    all at one point or other -- so I shouldn't begrudge others having their fling.
    I even became quite cosy with Helvetica for a while in the mid '80s. \r\n\r\nIn
    some ways it's like the repertoire of classical music. There was one pianist who
    was 30ish, and \"saving Beethoven for later\" (maybe I got the instrument and
    the composer wrong, but you get the idea).\r\n\r\nFrom a type designer's perspective,
    many of us take a crack at the classics, doing \"our\" version of Jenson or whatever.
    Jenson, Bodoni, Garamond -- those seem to be the \"essentials\" for reviving,
    and for using no doubt. So I would say, if you're going to get involved with one
    of those hoary old faces, why not work with a few variations -- including present
    day interpretations -- to really get the feel of the thing."

    of hypothetical question, IMO it's meaningless and a waste of time, it needs so
    much qualifying. Besides, I've always believed that the typeface should suit the
    job, not the typographer.\r\nI posted a reply, above, as the thought struck me
    at the time.\r\nI wrote an article, <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Assets/Depts/Essays/PerfcSet.pdf\">The

    your outlook it could be a redundant question. Some designers have the alternate
    view that a certain array of type could be chosen to fit most applications, which
    I see in your article you did when faced with an academic budget constraint. Looking
