body: Hi! Long time lurker, first time poster, and now I need your help! This is the
  title page of "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" from 1748 by the Scottish
  philosopher David Hume, but what font is it? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/66959_2_4740.jpg]

  body: "Based on the E and A, I would say this is a Caslon typeface. It is unlikely,
    I think to find this exact type in digital form, because each size in metal type
    was often a slightly different design. There are at least 6 different type sizes
    on this title page.\r\n\r\nThe most similar font I have found is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-caslon/?refby=bowfin|LTC
    Caslon]]. Unlike many Caslons it has the single-serif C (as does Adobe Caslon
    Pro).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    body: "Thank you Mike, I think you're probably correct! Adobe Caslon Pro was the
      first one I compared it too, but I decided against it because of the capital
      A if I recall correctly. However, looking at <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Caslon-schriftmusterblatt.jpeg\">this
      Caslon specimen</a> it looks very similar, and it seems Caslon would fit in
      well at the time and place it was printed.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
