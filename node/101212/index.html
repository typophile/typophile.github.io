So are all the instances of "private i" on the web incorrect? It wouldn't be the first time of course. And it certainly wouldn't be the first time Joe has tried to impose a fascist view of typography and pretend there's only one way to do something. But anyway, thanks for the [desire for] correction. Frankly I'd rather use "PI" though.

BTW since I can't edit the original post I'm hoping that humans can in fact adapt to spelling mistakes enough to help me figure this out. After all, I'm adapting fine to unprovoked vicious personal attacks!

George, thanks for that - interesting.

Justin, some offensive/incriminating (live) content has been removed since the screengrabs were made, and some people are hoping to salvage the reputation of a certain (minor) political aspirant by casting doubt on the authenticity of the screengrabs. My image above judiciously avoids the offending passage.

The more interesting aspect of this story BTW is that apparently this person's YouTube account was an anonymous one when the alleged offensive comments were made, but some time after Google acquired YouTube he decided to link the two accounts... not realizing that would cause all his old YouTube comments to get a real name! :-/  I wonder if somebody will sue somebody for that "privacy violation". Check that: I wonder <em>when</em> somebody will sue somebody for that "privacy violation". I personally don't think anonymous people should have privacy rights - that's like eating your cake and having it too.

So the moral of the story might be: Don't make anonymous comments - it's better to face the consequences of your desire to express your controversial opinions immediately... Or an even a better one: Don't run for public office because even if you did nothing wrong Democracy will make you pay.

Uh, no. It's like taking proactive steps to be private. Are you saying that a right to freedom of movement should only be had by people who don't move?

Now, I happen to think that being anonymous on, say, Typophile, is lame, but there are plenty of places in the world in which anonymity or pseuodonymity is a matter of personal safety, and is a necessity in part because privacy rights are abused or denied. And as the Google/YouTube account linking debacle shows, there may be good reason to be anonymous even in places where you don't think what you say might get you into trouble.</div>

I'm not sure. Your new screenshot is very obviously GDI ClearType. The image Hrant posted has very similar pixel patterns, but completely different colour values. Comparison:

John: Interesting. Does this affect the evaluation of its authenticity?

One assumption I'm making is -if it <em>is</em> a doctored screengrab- they used Photoshop, which produces very different text rendering. On the other hand it's pretty easy to change the original HTML and get a bona fide Firefox rendering of fake <em>content...</em>

I realize this stuff might be pretty hopeless - I just have to try for a friend.

Joe:
1) I tried not putting an apostrophe but it looked worse. I wish I could fix English.
2) Do you think the hyphen is incorrect?
3) Is an entire brain inhibited from addressing a problem when it sees disagreeable punctuation? Heres one that I hope will not prevent you from answer <em>these</em> questions.

Right, by "pretty much the same" I meant the pixel patterns and glyph widths/alignment. I would imagine that jpeg compression could account for the overall desaturation and other color artifacts. 

<blockquote>On the other hand it's pretty easy to change the original HTML and get a bona fide Firefox rendering of fake <em>content...</em></blockquote>

That would indeed be the way to go if one were trying to create a fake screenshot of a website. Any site's content can easily be altered right inside the browser using built-in developer tools or extensions like Firebug—no Photoshop required—and result in something indistinguishable from the real thing.</div>
