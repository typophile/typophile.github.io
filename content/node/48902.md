  body: Don't know if Thomas has a preference, but I'd say that here allows for more
    discussion and you can post images if needed. In any case, both places are good
    for collecting comments. Thomas has started threads on two mailing lists as well,
    so it's unlikely that all comments will end up in the same place. So, the bottom
    line is, post where you prefer. We'll be keeping an eye in all the places. Thanks!

    and mention in my documentation/publicity that my fonts support these \u201Ccode
    pages\u201D? \r\n\r\nYou are welcome to mention support for these character sets
    (or more properly glyph complements) in your documentation. (They aren't code
    pages... see below for some handy definitions.)\r\n\r\n> If so, isn\u2019t this
    all getting rather non-standard, with foundries such as H&FJ and their \u201CLatin-X\u201D
    encoding, and Microsoft with WGL-4?\r\n\r\n\"Latin-X\" is either a character set
    or a glyph complement, but it's not an encoding. But to your point, sure this
    is all \"non-standard\" because there were no standards in this area which we
    found useful. If there were standards, it would be an open question as to whether
    they would be keeping up with changes and developments in Unicode....\r\n\r\nWhy
    did we not just adopt these other companies' standards? Basically they didn't
    meet the needs we were trying to meet, in terms of global language support. I'm
    not saying they aren't useful and of course they support lots of languages and
    that's great. They just didn't do some things we thought were important.\r\n\r\nWGL-4
    is completely euro-centric: it includes support for languages spoken by only tens
    of thousands of people (e.g. Sami) but doesn't include support for langauges spoken
    by tens of millions of people (e.g. Pilipino/Tagalog in the Pacific and Yoruba
    in Africa).\r\n\r\nI haven't studied H&FJ's Latin-X character set closely (Latin-X
    is a registered trademark of H&FJ, so not sure we could use the name even if we
    used the character set), but I see that it doesn't support Pinyin transliteration
    of Chinese, something that I put in AL-4 (and hence in AL-5 as well). Neither
    does WGL-4, of course.\r\n\r\n> AL-3 doesn\u2019t support ISO 8859-14 Latin 8
    (Celtic), which seems to be part of the established ISO set of 1 through 10 encodings.\r\n\r\nOkay.
    Is this a problem? Why?\r\n\r\n> Where is the capital Eszett?\r\n\r\nU+1E9E. It's
    in AL-4 and Al-5. It was subject to some debate internally. One of us favored
    to relegating it to AL-5 only, under the theory that it isn't going to see much
    use at all. But we are putting it in AL-4, and we may very well add it to most
    of our AL-3 fonts as well in some retrofit some day.\r\n\r\n> \u201Calmost equal
    to\u201D is not really \u201Capproximately equal to\u201D, it sounds more like
    \u201Cslightly less than\u201D.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what you're referring to
    here. Can you clarify?\r\n\r\n> I note that you worked with Paratype on the Adobe
    Extended Cyrillic character set, which is very similar in coverage to the Paratype
    \u201CAsian Cyrillic\u201D code page. I followed the Paratype Asian Cyrillic code
    page in my Modern Suite fonts. I like the utilitarian rationale.\r\n\r\nYes, I
    asked Emil Yakupov from Paratype to review the work. Similarly, I got feedback
    from several folks on aspects of the new extended Latin charset, most notably
    Robert Bringhurst on pan-Athapaskan coverage.\r\n\r\nI wrote up a set of definitions
    for you as well, but they got eaten by the Web. I'll rewrite those and post them
    on my blog....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I've spent some time with the spreadsheet(s) & have a question on the IAST
    Indic transliteration -- perhaps this is more for the Unicode consortium than
    Adobe, but here goes:\r\n\r\nShouldn't the \"line below\" characters really be
    \"macron below\" characters? That is how I've always constructed them. Compare,
    for example, 1E5D with 1E5F. As  understand it, the combining low line (0332)
    connects on the left & right; the combining macron below (0331) would have the
    same width as a macron, 0304 (macron above).\r\n\r\nThis question comes up fairly
    often for us. Kiowa too uses either a \"line below\" or \"macron below.\" We usually
    try to steer people to the macron below, which will have the same width regardless
    of the setwidth of the character. And while is isn't suppose to come up in Kiowa
    (I'm told only one macron below per word), if you have two adjacent characters
    with a combining line below, you get, in effect, an single line under two characters.\r\n\r\n*
    * *\r\n\r\nIn general, I think I'm in a bad position to comment on the new character
    sets. All my experience is with reacting to texts sent to us for typesetting.
    In that position, I have to draw up only the glyphs needed for a particular job.
    Moreover, we can, and sometimes have to, accommodate authors/publishers with differing
    orthographies for the same language. On the other hand, someone who is primarily
    a font designer and who isn't going to revisit the fonts very often has to plan
    ahead. From my perspective, Thomas' & Miguel's job is far harder than mine.\r\n\r\nThe
    only thing I'd question is if the combining diacritical marks shouldn't be included
    at a rather basic level. These, not the legacy diacriticals, are where things
    should be headed."

    making use of combining diacritics using OpenType mark positioning, and in fact
    many, many combinations should \"just work\" which are not listed (and won't be
    explicitly tested, either). More on this in a future blog post.\r\n\r\nI agree
    with Charles Ellertson that \"macron below\" is probably the right description
    for those IAST Indic transliteration characters (although the source I was using
    used the \"line below\" description).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
