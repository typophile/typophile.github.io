  body: ' I like this font...at first glance, I thought that it had <BR> graf stylings,
    but looking at it a little longer,  I&#39;m  <BR>seeing a Whimsy-like face with
    some character.  <BR> <BR>It looks like your original intention &#40;and the source  <BR>of
    your frustration&#41; was to have nice, smooth curves. <BR> But to me it looks
    like the letters are a little  <BR>choppy/chunky...and that&#39;s a good thing.
    It has  <BR>a very hand drawn look. <BR> <BR>From what I see here, my suggestion
    would be to  <BR>even out the size &amp; weight of the characters.  <BR>The &#34;e&#34;
    seems a little small in relation to the other  <BR>characters. But on the other
    hand, I think that  <BR>variation adds to the hand drawn feeling. The stem  <BR>of
    the &#34;m&#34; also looks a little heavy in relation to the <BR> rest of the
    lines... <BR> <BR>I say keep it up and post more examples! '
