body: "May I kindly ask for your help? I do some research in terminology and looked
  for the first occurence of the term \xBBtypographus\xAB in the sense of \xBBprinter\xAB.
  By an older dictionary I was advised to look into the introduction of an incunable:\r\n\r\n
  \      Manilius, Marcus: Astronomicon. Hrsg. Stephanus Dulcinius. Mailand: Antonius
  Zarotus, 9.XI.1489\r\n\r\nbut the word isn\u2019t used there. Has anybody reading
  this forum other informations when the word \xBBtypographus\xAB came into use and
  when it appeared first?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRoland"
