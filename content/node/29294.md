  but would be delighted to find something similar, any thoughts? Many thanks, Ed[img:sites/default/files/old-images/initials_4794.jpg]

    of Jean Louis Pouch\xE9e' in an earlier issue of Baseline. The closest most people
    get to this in digital form is something like (god forbid) <a/href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_488.html\">Zebrawood.</a>\r\n\r\n"

  body: i'm guessing one reason that there aren't types like this is that they are
    so intricate they actually push the boundaries of the font format. something this
    intricate might be better served being distrubted as a series of [[EPS]] files
    (not to mention how time consuming it would be to digitize a series of these initials!)

  body: Emigre had to resort to EPS files for one of their fonts which I've suddenly
    forgotten. I believe it is Missionary. :^/
