body: "Hey typophiles, I've got another logotype that near to completion. This one
  has been really difficult for me so I really need your guys eyes on this. \r\n\r\nI've
  been asked to create a logotype for a wool felt and leather iPhone, iPad, MacBook
  Sleeve accessory maker who also makes really nice leather bags. She has become very
  popular on Etsy and has created quite a name for herself, and thought it was time
  to get a custom mark. She was formerly an architect and applies her clean modern
  aesthetic to all her pieces. She asked me to create a custom logotype that would
  reflect her taste and design ethos. \r\n\r\nThe brief included some very specific
  requests, namely: It must haves serifs, must have high ascenders, must use an ampersand
  and not a '+', it should pair nicely with neutraface, it should be inspired by midcentury
  modern architecture and design, it should be clean and not too feminine.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_BirdBelle_01_6373.jpg]\r\n\r\nWith
  this brief in mind I made a humanist (almost geometric) slab serif. Since she makes
  cases I wanted the ampersand to appear to be held between the 'd' and the 'b'. In
  the initial phase of this project she really fell in love with some sketches and
  the way i rendered the text with a pencil with lines to align the stem heights,
  tops and bottoms. It reminded her of architectal sketchs and the way she designs
  each of her products, so also attached is a roughed up version. Once I have the
  digital version refined to a t, i plan on redrawing it with a pencil to get the
  real deal.\r\n\r\nLooking for any areas where a line looks too fat or a curve looks
  to wavy. Thanks in advance.  "

  body: Looks good. Normally, the serif on the top of the d should point towards the
    left. I think it will look better when you make the & smaller. e seems a bit too
    wide. You might consider making 'HANDMADE MODERN' larger, so that it's still legible
    at small size. The gap in your e will probably disappear at smaller sizes, so
    I'd make it a bit larger, or at least test it. good luck.

  body: "1. The ampersand looks a tad large \u2014 perhaps set a separate 'cap-height'
    that it comes up to as opposed to ascender height as you have it now. \r\n\r\n2.
    The 'e' looks like it needs more modulation; its stroke width is a bit too uniform.
    This makes it look thicker than it should. Use the bowls on 'b' and 'd' as a guide
    to how much to thin the stroke.\r\n\r\n3. It might just be my taste, but I'm not
    convinced neutraface is the right face for the tagline. Something about it doesn't
    sit right with your custom lettering above.\r\n\r\nNice work"
