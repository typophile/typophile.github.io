  Mystery Science Theater 3000?\r\n\r\nIt looks oddly like the font used for this
  message.\r\n\r\nHere's a screen cap of the credits if that helps.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/end
  credits_3902.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis screen cap is from a 1989 episode.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSubBot"

  body: Not the same as this message font, which has a lower case h ascending higher

    quite right.\r\n\r\nHere's another screen cap.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/copyright_4426.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    8, S, I and N look a little different.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comparison_6399.jpg]\r\n\r\nSubBot"
