I do remember from a type specimen book a monospaced typeface that was <em>not</em> created to imitate a typewriter. It was called "mailing list type".

Now, I wonder, did the people who made computers had the monospaced fonts in their systems on purpose, because of the screen capabilities or maybe monospaced pixel fonts were easy to make for them and that's why they used those kind of fonts. Or, maybe it was the screens that showed the fonts monospaced and pixel like?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Early computer screens generally used monospaced character displays. It simplified the software and hardware, which was not very fast and had very little memory compared to modern computers. This "character mode" was usually the default. The character shapes were hard-coded into the hardware. Displays were advertised as having, say, an "80-column display", meaning you could fit 80 characters across the screen (usually about 24 lines). The size was usually fixed, although sometimes there were "low res" modes that doubled the height and/or width of the characters.

In some computer systems (maybe most?) you could change out the default character designs to a set that was stored in memory, but this meant you had less memory for programs. Usually, you only did this for games or graphics programs.

Proportional fonts and other sizes were possible if you programmed the computer to use its "graphics mode", which let you draw arbitrary images on the display and address each pixel independently (you could only address characters in character mode). However, this used a lot more memory and was a lot slower than character mode. 

There were computers in the '70s and early '80s that had proportional fonts, such as the Xerox Alto and preview displays for computer typesetting front-ends. There were also graphics programs for the IBM PC and Apple II that let you work with proportional fonts for word processing and graphics. The Mac (1984) was the first popular personal computer to use proportional, arbitrarily sized fonts by default (no character mode--graphics mode only!), but it also included a monospaced font (Monaco). (I seem to recall that some reviewers knocked it for not having an "80-column display".)

One thing that was probably also a factor in favor of monospaced fonts in early computers: Before CRT displays were economically feasible, you usually interacted with the computer using a teletype terminal. This was basically an electric typewriter that could transmit and receive character codes to and from the computer. It was natural (and technically easier) to emulate the monospaced typewriter output on the CRT display, rather than emulate typesetting.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Since typewriters produced tolerable text with monospaced typefaces, and since computer line printers (for technical reasons) were designed to produce monospaced text as well ([[http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/lineint.htm|theoretically]], if someone wanted, a chain printer with limited proportional spacing, like an IBM Executive, was a theoretical possibility, but you couldn't do that with most other line printer designs like the more common drum printer), it would have made sense to design terminals with monospaced printing simply so that people could preview reports to be printed on printers.

As well, many computer languages had restrictions on what columns you could use for statements, because they were designed around the punched card.

But the clincher was in how terminals were designed. Because of the high cost of memory in the early days, a computer terminal would normally not have the ability to display arbitrary graphics. It would have storage to contain the characters to go on the screen, and use a "character generator" to look up which dots to display for each raster line of the character.

It would have involved a considerable amount of extra expense and logic to allow different characters to take up different amounts of space on the screen.

Of course, some terminals using unusual technologies, like the Tektronix 4010 or other storage-tube graphics terminals would have been an exception, but proportional spacing, unless the computer was used for typesetting, would have been considered a very wasteful luxury.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps not. I've got a book on SmallTalk (as used with the Xerox Alto and Star) and all the program listings are set in Helvetica. I believe a Helvetica-like font was used on-screen for programming it. I also remember that early Mac programming languages (MacPascal, AppleScript, Microsoft Basic) used Geneva, a proportional font.

I think one reason monospaced fonts are preferred is because they make it easier to spot errors, the idea being that characters are more easily distinguished from one another. However, it does seem like there are proportional fonts that have that quality, so maybe it's just an excuse and it's just a habit.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Monospaced typefaces certainly aren't essential for programming. Algol and Pascal programs, for example, are often shown in a typeset "publication format".

They had been useful for programming at one point simply because their output would be likely to be printed on high-speed printers that for technical reasons had to be monospaced.

And, as I noted, proportional spacing on displays would, in the past, have been an expensive frill.

That being said, monospaced typefaces still find some use in computing because many programs are used to produce output in <em>tabular</em> form, and a monospaced typeface ensures that "character position" and "paper position" are related, so that no special complexities are required in producing tabular output <em>directly</em> from a program that was written in a plain fashion, concentrating on its numerical calculations only.

Today, people tend to think of a programming language as a tool in a process of developing an application, which is given a fancy user interface for massive sale. At one time, programming languages were tools to get numerical answers to questions - used almost the way people use a spreadsheet.</div>

I would guess that the word recognition mechanisms useful in text reading would not be as effective in parsing numerical strings where character recognition mechanisms are probably more effective.  Computer languages could variously fall somewhere in between on that spectrum.  How those mechanisms operate on fixed width vs. proportional spacing is the next question.

Taking monospaced fonts and proportionalizing them, I've experimented with InDesign's "optical" kerning, but it doesn't have much effect.

The biggest improvement seems to be by reducing word space to 50–70% in H&Js. This has the biggest effect on Panoptica, which is "non-gappy" (i.e. 'l' and 'i' glyphs don't have huge sidebearings)</div>

And that's not even always a bug. One feature some text editors have is a mode where you can select a rectangular block of text - this is useful for editing certain kinds of data in tabular form.

UltraEdit has a very good implementation of this feature; I don't know about gedit, but Kate had a so-so version of this feature, good enough for me to do some editing work on one of my pages like [[http://www.quadibloc.com/arch/ar010003.htm|this one]], copying parts the table of instructions from two other different instruction modes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Monospaced fonts are pretty healthy these days. If you start looking, you’ll find many variants and styles for different purposes. My favorite is DejaVu Mono (http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page), which is not only well designed, but has very large character set, and is in active development.

Another reason, beyond those cited above, for the prevalence of monospaced fonts in programming, is that much of programming happens in a tabular mode.  It’s common to have various levels of indentation for blocks of code, which are created using tab characters or runs of spaces.  It’s also common to include comments that relate the code, but in another ‘column’ separate from the code itself. These conventions depend not only on monospaced visible characters, but perhaps even more on monospaced <i>space</i> characters.

I was going to include an example here, but it looks like Typophile doesn’t allow me to use &lt;pre&gt; tags. ;-)  Instead, see https://gist.github.com/1140179.

It’s quite difficult to make this style work without presuming a monospaced grid into which all characters fit. It’s also quite difficult to create text editors that understand a given language to an extent that layout like the above can be done with traditional proportional-spaced fonts.

Yes, some more sophisticated typographic tools would be nice at this particular web site!
I would really like to be able to use tabs (or hard spaces), and have better control over paragraph spacing.</div>

Yes, but it causes problems if you use it to share Python or AFDKO feature code, which comes up on a forum like this fairly often. Especially Python, which uses indentation syntactically.</div>

How can it cause problems? For instance, here is some python code:
<code>
for&nbsp;i&nbsp;in&nbsp;range(4):
&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;j&nbsp;in&nbsp;range(4):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print&nbsp;i,j
</code>
Ok, the html source contains nbsp but if you copy the text above as it is and paste it in python, it executes correctly.</div>

Actually, after a bit of testing, it looks like the problem is with FontLab. Your code works fine if I run it from Terminal, TextMate, or BBEdit, but if I paste it into FontLab's macro editor, it won't work unless I convert all the non-breaking spaces to normal spaces. Presumably, the nbsp trick should work with feature code, too, if you're not pasting into FontLab.

So, I guess a quick way to fix this, if you're trying to use the code in FontLab, is to paste it into a text editor, then copy it from there and paste into FontLab.

Editing Python and feature code in FontLab sucks, anyway. One more reason to avoid it.</div>
