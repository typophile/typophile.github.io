  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Good evening, ladies &amp; gentlemen,
I&rsquo;ld like to ask for your opinion about the german illustrator A. Paul Weber.
Is he known out of Germany? What do you think about his work?
Is it art?</p>
<p>Its more a private question and I hope I am not disturbing.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.
Ah&hellip; what I forgot: 
My Avatar shows one of A. Paul Weber&rsquo;s illustrations.
Its called &ldquo;Optimismus ist Feigheit&rdquo; - (&ldquo;Optimism is Cowardice&rdquo;). 
Its from 1934.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another one, called &ldquo;Das Geruecht&rdquo; (The Rumor)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Something about it reminds me of Otto Dix. Rather than foolishly try to define what is art I would simply ask if his work is collected and displayed by art institutions as they are in the business of defining the issue.</p>
<p>Also look at defined sub-genres like &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; art. There is a wonderful book that comes to mind published by the Museum of American Folk Art titled <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Self-taught Artists of the 20th Century<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (ISBN 0-8118-2098-X) you might look at. I was particularly taken with A. G. Rizzoli and his work. The line between fine art and works recognized but relegated to qualified sub groups is hardly worth the time spent thinking about it. If it sticks with you and gets you going it is good.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well&hellip;
I agree that it makes no sense to discuss if something is art or not. Its enough to be touched. 
What I am thinking about: Weber was a political illustrator and he fought against Nazism in Germany. But - and this is very important (for me) - he does it in 1934, one year after the Nazis overtook Germany. And not in 2008 virtually in the Internet like lots of people who claim their anti-facism opinion (this is much more easier).</p>
<p>If someone insists on to forbid to show these illustrations - does&rsquo;nt he try to hurt the general freedom of art? Do you think its a frontier violation or a worse attac against whomever to use e.g. the Avatar I do?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Who has the power to forbid that an artists work be shown? A curator makes a decision to include this artist and not another. I mention Dix because he was political and active during both world wars. You find, though, that his paintings relate to the German Expressionist movement in style. This makes his work linked historically to a movement and its stylistic innovation. He is not collected because of his political message.</p>
<p>Possibly Weber worked in a political style but did not participate as heavily in the innovation of the German Expressionists. I don&rsquo;t know his body of work, and I&rsquo;m not a curator so it is hard to judge if he is overlooked.</p>
<p>Maybe you are speaking about copyright issues when you discuss showing the art and the use of the avatar?</p>

I try a personal open question in an open forum.
That&rsquo;s alright for you?
Nothing to do with any forum owners or whomever exept me.

<p>No, I&rsquo;m not thinking about copyrights.
I do not know enough foreigners in Germany I can ask.
So I thougt to get an idea here how people out of Germany think about the artist A. Paul Weber, his work and if it is &ldquo;political correct&rdquo; to like, use and to show his illustrations.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t look at work as a primary expression of political ideas. For most of us it is what we say and what we buy that has the most dramatic influence even though it is a small one. Great images do happen though, and great artists amplify their [[http://books.google.com/books?id=Nh-7jx2n4LgC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=kiefer+sieg+heil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5EXHqHIDNt&amp;sig=EBHBN_l0WGfi8JHj-lhMn_IQLGA#PPA132,M1|ideas]].</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve never heard about Faust. But I saw Kraftwerk in Kunsthalle (Museum of Art) in Duesseldorf 1970 or so&hellip; 400 freaks, all stoned and/or on good Timothy Leary&rsquo;s acid. Kraftwerk and its lasesrshow. It was dramaticly good.</p>
<p>No, not as a primary one. I don&rsquo;t believe that artists like Weber, Grosz and others thought in this way. They were bravehearted enough to work in an active way against the majority which voted AH. And this is the same majority which does not have any civilcourage (JFK) today to stand up and to say the truth.</p>
<p>Thanks for the nice conversation.</p>
