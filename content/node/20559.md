body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis occured to me while flipping through some old Graphis Annuals
  this morning, has anyone created a font based on [[Paul Rand]]'s script lettering?
  It would make a pretty striking typeface (Rand Hand?). Don't know what it could
  be used for particularly but just thought in this day and age somebody must have
  had a go. Any thoughts? Is it too idiomatic? What are the ethics of adapting another
  designer's lettering style? Is this a job for P22? Or perhaps it could be the new
  Caflisch Script?\r\n\r\nOr maybe it's been done, or it's just a rubbish idea...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "\"or it\u2019s just a rubbish idea\u2026\"\r\n\r\nYou answered your own question.
    All of these fonts based on artists writing are a rubbish idea. Leave Mr Rand's
    handwriting alone. He was America's greatest designer ever, maybe even the world's
    greatest designer ever. Its completely disrespectful to take what was his written
    voice and use it for your benefit."

  body: "Ha ha!\r\n\r\nI'm afraid my FontLab skills are pretty basic Pattyfab, and
    I kind of agree with Mr. Old Bugger, and I need another project like a hole in
    the hand...\r\n\r\nBut it's a good object lesson for a new script design if nothing
    else. Don't you think? And maybe I should do a little more with my copy of FontLab...\r\n\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n<a
