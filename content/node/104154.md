  \"C\". \r\nNow I having a bit of an issue trying to pair it with a typeface\r\n\r\nIm
  creating some of the branded collateral now.  Looking for it to be modern but not
  cold.\r\nI was thinking of doing sans for one option like univers or gotham.\r\nBut
  I am looking for another option with a serif..\r\n\r\nAny suggestions....\r\n\r\nThanks!!!"
