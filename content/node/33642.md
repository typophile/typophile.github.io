body: i usually try to keep my currency symbols on a tabular width, but is there a
  good way to do this for the [[rupee]] or the [[peseta]]? i guess i could use smallish
  caps and lay them on their sides, but i'm not sold on that as a solution. do any
  of you have any good tips on how to go about this, or is this a non-issue?

    width, and maybe the pound sterling, the Euro is impossible."

    I had no idea. Still it make sense. I assume you mean the U+20A8 Rupee Sign which
    is the Rs.\r\n\r\nAlso, are you using the Slash P or the Pts as the Peseta symbol.
    Also, Hasn't the Peseta been replaced utterly by the Euro? Obviously not for historical
    purposes though..."

    is not true of many, if not most users. And this is why many type designers (such
    as JFP) make their numerals and currency symbols exactly twice the width of the
    blank space, and other non-alphabetics whole multiples of the space as well. Here's
    a nice table from the Linotype Generis brochure:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GenerisWidths_6125.gif]\r\n\r\n>

  body: The thing with the Euro is that as handed down by the grey suited ( I assume)
    Euro folks it was supposed to be like the sign for estimated (0x212E), which is
    to say it's supposed to be unchangable/unmodifiable. But I don't see type designers
    sticking to that in general and I actually really don't think they should.  I
    quite like the Euro squished up a bit like Hrant has it in his example. The other
    ( official shape ) way it draws way too much attention to itself.

    good idea if it doesn't compromise the proportions of those symbols, and that's
    true for the dollar and sterling symbol.\r\nBut for the Euro in a normally proportioned
    type, in comparison with lining figures, it makes it look as if it has been swiped
    from the condensed version of the face. (Bearing in mind that lining figures already
    have a condensed aspect in relation to the alphabetic characters.)\r\nIn the sample
    shown, the poor emaciated Euro looks more like a mark than a real character, and
    that would be even further demonstrated if alphabetic characters were shown. But
    perhaps that's what it deserves.\r\n\r\nNone of this would bother the modern OpenType
    megafont designer, whose design solution would be to provide alternate Stylistic
    Sets of tabular and proportional monetary symbols :-)"

    working on (in some cases such as the Euro). most everything else i just make
    tabular if i can (call me lazy). This is what lead me to my original question,
    i'd like to make some tabular forms for these figures, if i can, but i don't think
    squooshing will work. i might hafta \"invent\" some tabular forms i guess."
