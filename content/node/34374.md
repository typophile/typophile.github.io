body: Maybe this has been around and many have seen it already, but upon venturing
  to <a href=http://www.adobe.com/type/>Adobe Type</a> for the first time in a while
  I was enthralled by the demo videos ("type + motion") on the main page demonstrating
  how After Effects works with good typography. Some really terrific work being exhibited
  in the five parts of the series. Now I'm officially inspired to learn After Effects
  after much procrastination.

    of work. It was created with Flash. (Unless Flash is now one of the output formats
    that AE supports.)

  body: Well, I knew that the whole setup was Flash, but I thought that the 5 individual
    movies were from After Effects. If they're not, that's some shady advertising.
    But on reflection I think the individual movies are; in each, they show very briefly
    how to create the effect in After Effects. Even if Flash were completely responsible,
    my previous statement still stands; I've been procrastinating about Flash, too.

  body: "I'm afraid Don McCahill has turned it around. :) The 5 individual movies
    were defenitely not created in Flash, but are prime examples of After Effects
    animation and composition. Also seen in the <a href=\"http://4.upload.dailymotion.com/video/x1a6sk_intonation\">Pulp
    Fiction quoting movie</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXxouXt5dz4\">The
    Lions Roar</a>, amongst others. As far as I can tell both 100% AE as well.\r\n\r\nI'm
    learning After Effects at the moment, and the animated type and 3D-type on Adobe.com
    are both AE, and it's not even so difficult to do (though those movies are of
    quite high level and quality). The 3D-imagery of course is material from other
    software (e.g. the buildings and such).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
