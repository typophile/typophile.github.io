  laser cut from (rather than printed on) the page. It is roughly one by two inches
  of a six inch by six inch page.\r\n\r\nI am interested in opinions on using the
  reverse of the page. Although I could use the space, I am concerned a backwards
  reading wordmark would be too distracting and confusing, esp if I set text around
  it.\r\n\r\nHas anyone worked around this before? Is the reverse a total loss?\r\n\r\nToo
  bad the wordmark isn\u2019t an ambigram. That would have been clever \u2026.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTim\r\n"

    but in the correct order. It will read right, approximately, and thus be less
    distracting.\r\n\r\nFor a clever effect, you could print the back with a solid
    color or grey, and have the wordmark again in white with some perspective distortion,
    making it look like light is shining through the holes and projecting the correctly-reading
    wordmark."

  body: "I played around with this, but unfortunately, the wordmark is <em>chop</em>
    in all lowercase, which reads upside down as <em>c&#181;ob</em>. \r\n\r\nIs it
    more confusing if it looks like it might actually be a word? Or is obvious nonsense
    (paradoxically) clearer?"

  body: "Ooh. I see what you mean. My suggestion really only works for capitals. And
    any kind of doubling of the mark is likely to be interpreted as \"chop chop.\"\r\n\r\nI
    take it the mark is set in stone? If you wanted to redesign it for symmetry, all
    you would need is something like \"CHO\xDE\"."

      pursuaded to change. I'll test the waters.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
