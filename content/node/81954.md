  a lot. I want to learn typography much more. I want to go to university and there
  is no specific typography university in Indonesia even in Asia. But, it seems so
  hard to find the proper university that provide scholarship. I prefer to go to Netherlands,
  Germany, France, Italy, USA, Aus, and Other countries (except England and Japan
  -- coz the currency with IDR is extremely yaa.. you know) \r\n\r\nI want your suggestion
  please... and please keep sharing if your are the one who studies in typography

  body: "eliason\u2019s link is a good place to start. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know a
    lot about typeface design programs. I focus on how typography influences human
    performance such as reading comprehension. Before you decide where you want to
    spend your time and money, you really need to focus on your area of interest.
    Letterforms, history, technology, human performance\u2026 Who would you like to
    employ you, and for what, when you are complete?\r\n\r\nAnswer these questions
    and your choice will present itself."

  body: "@Gunarta: If you are interested in starting a school, then you will require
    many skills. Sadly, the top of the list will most likely be business, management,
    and administration. Next, you will require knowledge of pedagogy (in an educational
    context). Rhetoric and semiotics can\u2019t hurt either. THEN, you can start focusing
    on subject matter. \r\n\r\nYou need to ask yourself what do you want your school
    to teach? And you can\u2019t answer \u201Ctypography.\u201D That\u2019s about
    as broad as saying \u201Cart\u201D which could mean:\r\n\r\npainting\r\ndrawing\r\nfilm\r\nphotography\r\nsculpture\r\nwood

  body: "Gunarta, negative comments are not helpful, and comments about your punctuation
    and/or american slang are just useless to say anything that can give you a clue
    or a solution for your asks.\r\nI'm a 20 years experienced designer, and I want
    to be a typographer too! yes.. what we want to do is to focus just in typography,
    so it's so valid to answer \"just typography\" if you have a previous bachelor
    degree. What I know is that the Reading University is one of the major schools
    for an MA in typography, but, as you said, The UK is not an option because.. well..
    ya'know! so there are cheaper options but I'm affraid language could be a problem
    for you, there are a master in Barcelona, Spain and the other one is in Veracruz,
    Mexico, both of them in Spanish (in Barcelona could be sometimes in Catalan).
    Anyway, if you want to take a look around visit:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eina.edu/index.php?fuseaction=show-section&level=2&lang=es&id=43\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ub.edu/web/ub/es/estudis/oferta_formativa/master_universitari/fitxa/T/M0906/index.html\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cegestalt.com/portal/\r\n\r\nI
    agree that what Christopher says is correct for those seeking a bachelor's degree,
    but what is concerning a master's degree I suggest him to make a little more research
    before commenting as severe."
