i thought you guys may have some good thoughts regarding my thesis, so here i am.

basically, i think it's impossible to remove the linguistic implications from a letterform and see it as a random shape.  granted, there are certain criteria you'd have to follow such as not counting dingbats etc.  im talking straight up, looking at a letter "A" and thinking "i dont get it."  of course, this is can be influenced by context, scale, etc. also what happens when you enhance the basic form a letter with dimension, time, etc, where youre arent changing the basic structure, just adding to it. but i guess what im wondering is if you have any initial thoughts or resources you think i should check out.  anything would be appreciated.  if youd like some more in depth info on what im working on, you can contact me directly if you want or if everyones ok with some lengthy posts i can respond on here.

thanks a lot.</div>

Hi Alex,
yup... you need to explain what direction you are taking as Eben suggested. And yes, you can remove liguistic implications (by this do you actually mean phonetic associations?) from letterforms, but it takes training both eye and mind.

BTW -- your "fixing up BRB" on your web site is refreshing.

ok so when you look at a letter A, you will only see it as a letter A, whether it's being used in text or as a design elements.  you'll still understand that what you're looking at is a letterform.  the only kink in that is adding dimension, texture, etc. to the shape.  like for example, looking at a 3-dimensional A from the top.

also, i guess i should add the relevance ie. why i'm even asking.

our capacity to read letterforms has flourished through the inundation of messages we receive and the proliferation of typefaces that challenge traditional letterform shapes.  im not saying they all look good or anything, but our understanding of these shapes has been enriched.  even with things like "wheel of fortune" we seek out letterforms.  seeing a bunch of sticks on the ground and thinking "that looks like a K."  we're just raised to search for messages.

this all leads to a broader range within which we can deliver meaning and distress type and still create clear messages.

at what point do these letterforms cease to retain their linguistic value?  i believe this only occurs when elements are added to the basic shape of what defines letterforms. </div>

A thesis! Excellent. Let me re-phrase what you have written & see if I get you here. You are saying that - there is a degree to which all 'a's are 'a's and that may be more or less (& maybe more or less depending on the reader?) You are also saying that in general we are expanding our willingness to see an 'a' over time due to exposure to increasingly less 'a'-like 'a' shapes. You are also saying that there is a point at which the 'a' stops being recognized as such. It ceases to be a recognized as a letter.

> i believe this only occurs when elements are added to the basic shape of what defines letterforms.

You are saying this happens when too many features of 'a' ness are lost. This might be degenration, fading, etc - or it might be an extreme design which has failed.

This is your example of 'looking at a letter “A” and thinking “i dont get it.” '. As in 'I don't see a letter there'.

If this is what you are talking about it is a sort opposite end of what has been a topic around here recently - readability. You are talking about the moment when type becomes unreadable.</div>

yes, the degree of A-ness changes, but stays within the "threshold of semiosis" which i'm citing from an article in zed issue 4.  on one end there is no doubt at what is presented and the other shows extreme doubt.  our abilities to read letterforms that may lean toward the extreme end are improving with the way we presented messages, or even in some cases our need to seek out messages where they appear to be leacking.

i'm working on being more articulate with my thoughts (thankfully i have an editor and topic consultant to help with much of that) but youve got it.  any references or other thoughts would great.  i've been reading alot on semiotics and other theory-related texts, and also looking for designers whose typefaces fit within the realm of this thesis.  ji lee and his "univers revolved" and faces by fere-jones are getting alot of talk in my paper.  even some of the work over at typeworkshops.com is worth mentioning, anton beeke, dainippon, some of the stuff fuse did, are all references on current examples running along that threshold.

oh and also, i'm basing the notion of what makes a letterform on frutiger's "skeleton" of a letter, but expanding it to reference the white space around a letter as also defining it's shape.  so i'm calling it a "soul."

additionally, a letter is defined semiotically not just by its shape or the spoken letter it represents, but the other letters it is NOT.  so an A is an A because it is not a B or a Z etc.  even further, the A may not exist if there is no B or Z etc.  the latter notion is really taken into consideration when looking at typefaces that are pretty hard to discern, but when you see them in context, the forms make more sense.</div>

i was hoping to figure out a way to make a typeface generator (like metafont) that i could input a beginning face and ending face and have it create the steps in between.  i'm not a programmer and i'm not familiar if font lab or other programs are capable of helping generate this sort of typeface.  fontlab's lack of a helpfile and 700 page pdf manual dont help either, ha.</div>

<em>i think it’s impossible to remove the linguistic implications from a letterform</em>

funny...this is sort of the exact opposite of my <a href="http://www.typetalkfonts.com" target="_blank">thesis project</a>, yet they are very much connected...

Are you focusing only on perceptions of the Latin alphabet (i suppose anything more would be a huge undertaking) ? Are you also looking at perceptions of the symbols/ characters of unfamiliar languages?  There are some type designers who will not design type for a language they do not read/write. Perhaps this is because of that relationship which you are exploring, connecting even further the relationship between the form/content of type and written language...

I think you'll enjoy David Sacks' "Language Visible: Unraveling the Mystery of the Alphabet from A to Z". it's not very academic, but it gives an interesting historical perspective on the alphabet.

I'd also be interesting in reading/seeing your thesis if you want some more feedback...i have some [recent] experience in that...

good luck!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">eben and amy p,

i'm still pretty early in the thesis process, but this topic came about from a discussion with a faculty member here at SCAD.  i dont recall the whole conversation, but at one point we argued over seeing a letterform as a shape and not as a letter.  i'm not arguing against type being used as design elements, but even then, a reader will see it as a letterform being used as a design element.  i just dont see it as possible to look at a letterform and not recognize it as such.  yes, i plan to only deal with the latin alphabet, as much of this defined culturally.  i wouldnt recognize japanese characters if i saw them.  i may recognize it as some form of language, but i could be fooled pretty easily on that.

i realize this has been discussed in varying degrees, but discussing type semiotically is so interesting to me.  but its also the hard part since so much has been said already.  please let me know if you have suggestions in thinking i should take the thesis in another direction, based on that conversation i had.

i would love to keep you all up to date on the progress including visuals once their developed, and also would apreciate any feedback along the way.

thanks for all the reference suggestions, i've made notes on them all and am checking them out.</div>

i dont think scaling up a letter beyond the bounds of the page or screen or whatever the presentation falls within the criteria, because if you cut off a letterform to just counters, etc, youre not really viewing the letter.  and i do agree whitespace aids in defining the shape of letterforms.  but youre not really keeping the letterform intact by scaling so large as to hide portions.  did that make sense?  the whole point is to keep the letterform intact.  now if youre saying the letter is painted on a wall or something that could be something different all together.  i guess it becomes a matter of how close to the letterform you are when trying to read it.  sort of like trying to figure out whats happening in a movie while sitting the front row.  i hate that.</div>

that's something totally different, looking at the white i mean.  i agree that the surrounding space influences perception of a shape, but i 'm not speaking at directly looking at that space.  but you do have a valid point when you mentioned training yourself.  the notion of purposely trying to avoid seeing the letterform is something i had not considered before.  but essentially, i think we're talking about two different, albeit related, ideas.
