body: "FF CST was originally called FF City Street Type, but  after this naming had
  been challenged by Berthold Types, the owners of the City trademark,  it was agreed
  that the publisher, FontShop International, would refrain from using the full name.
  The type family by Berlin designers Ole Sch\xE4fer and Verena Gerlach is based on
  the two very distinct alphabets  used in former East and West Berlin. "
