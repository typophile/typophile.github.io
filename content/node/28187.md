      9 and Base 12</a>, two large families, with sans and serif. Includes condensed.
      I've used Base 9 and 12 together to set a whole magazine; it took a delicate
      touch with type size, leading and letterspacing, but it worked well in the end.

  body: "I agree with Maurice! Just because two (or more) typefaces were not marketed
    as belonging to the same family, doesn't mean that they can't be paired or that
    they, in fact, weren't thought out as serif/sans counterparts.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    I think that several typefaces by [[Adrian Frutiger]] follow the same structure/skeleton,
    and so they can easily be paired and could even be part of the same family. Example
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/familytree.html\">Univers</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/glypha/familytree.html\">Glypha</a>.\r\n\r\nThe
    same is true for some [[Hermann Zapf]]'s typefaces: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/familytree.html\">Optima</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino/familytree.html\">Palatino</a>.\r\n\r\nBut,
    hey Ben, don't get upset. Here are two examples of super duper type families:\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Corporate+ASE\">Corporate</a>
    (A, S, E), and <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/94405/compatilfontfamilygroup-clan.html\">Compatil</a>
    (Exquisit, Fact, Letter, Text).\r\n\r\n(BTW, would you have paired the Compatil
    typefaces, had they been marketed separately? ;^)"

  body: "Hey Miguel why would I be upset? I've never said that one couldn't pair <em>(two
    or more) typefaces that were not marketed as belonging to the same family.</em>
    Indeed, I've paired Gill Sans and Perpetua together in book design myself... had
    they been designed as a related family, you might have less idea about which of
    the two I used as a text face, but I think you can guess.\r\n\r\nAs you'll know,
    the design motive is to pair them for their structural differences. I think Bringhurst
    says something about it, but you can see it in practice all around.\r\n\r\nIn
    point of fact, what Majoor says is supposition. <em>Had Eric Gill planned Joanna
    and Gill Sans as one family he would have been the first in history to design
    a family of serif and sans, <strong>but he made them as separate designs with
    separate names.</strong></em> And, I might add, at separate times for separate
    reasons.\r\n\r\nReading the Essay on Typography (which is set in Joanna but details
    the design of Gill Sans) gives one an idea of what Gill would have said about
    the very idea of a hybrid typeface, and it wouldn't have been complimentary. Gill
    Sans and Joanna had very different origins; one in signage and the other as a
    text face. One was an external commission and the other a self-initiated project.
    Some similarities arise because the same man designed them, but it is ridiculous
    to claim that they were conceived as sans/serif counterparts of the same type
    family."

    Gill did for a facia. I'd argue that Perpetua Titling was born before Perpetua
    proper. \r\n\r\nPerpetua might have been used as a text face, it might still be,
    but it wasn't and still isn't a workhorse textface, it is more of a show pony.
    \r\n\r\nBoth Gill Sans and Perpetua have their roots in the stone carving of Eric
    Gill. Which is, more or less, display type. \r\n\r\n"
