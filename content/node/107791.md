  body: "Thanks Fivos for the ID.\r\nMike Yanega scanned Tasmin from one of the Dover
    books with alphabets of old metal fonts collected by Dan X. Solo and used it for
    the showing of Tasmin in his Bauhaus Font ID Guide http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces6.html.
    Here is an excerpt showing the Uppercase.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TasminBoldDetail_3953.jpg]\r\nNote
    the two forms of S.\r\nHere is the WSI Tango version: The S matches your image.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TangoWSI_6001.jpg]\r\nHere
    is a different digitization, Tasmin International by David L. Crosby Typeface
    \xA9 Awareness Center 2007.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TasminInternational_5938.jpg]\r\nIt
    uses the other S.\r\nAs far as I know there are no other digitizations of Tasmin.\r\nWSI
    was a gang of font pirates, but this may have been one they did themselves.\r\nI
    know nothing about David L. Crosby.\r\nAs I have no information on the legitimacy
    of either font, I have not provided links.\r\nDon"
