    that's a handy link, thanks. On this system (and this is at work, not on my OWN
    machine) it shows only two fonts with yogh: MS Sans as Chris suggested, and a
    pixel-font I made myself (LOL). Palatino's got a sort of spiral at that character
    code, and Zapfino's got something that might be a double prime or a quotation
    mark...\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver since I chose

  body: Now home and on a Vista machine; here I <em>do</em> see the yogh in TNR and
    Tahoma (using Nina's link). Also Segoe UI, and Courier New, amongst a few others.
    Goes to show that updates to fonts from version to version mean you can't necessarily
    trust that someone with what appears to be the same font will have access to the
    same character set...

  body: "@Nick: OK, well what <em>I</em> meant by system font in my original question
    was a font bundled with the OS, so that I could safely assume that another user
    of a Windows system would definitely have it. <em>Perhaps</em> I misused the terminology:
    ...semantics, meh. Since MS Sans falls within both definitions that sorted me
    out wrt that. The subsequent discussions have been interesting nonetheless! :-D\r\n\r\nBTW,
    agree with you on keeping the design of the character in keeping with whatever
    level of modernity the rest of the font has. I've read more than one linguistics
    book where the author has had to use yogh (and wynn, etc.) in discussions of OE,
    and the thing has stuck out like a sore thumb because it didn't look like it belonged
    to the same font...\r\n\r\n@si: thanks, didn't know that. \r\n________________________________________________\r\nEver

    right there with you, Nick. (I was poking gentle fun, because I know your position
    on bundled fonts.)\r\n\r\nBut you raise a good question about the definition.
    Technically, I think you're probably right. But I think the more commonly understood
    usage of the term \"system fonts\" in this context is any fonts bundled with the
    system.\r\n"

    immediate plans of which I am aware. But if enough of you contact MS with a request
    for an expanded Constantia, it might happen. Ideally, all the CT fonts would be
    brought up to the same level of Unicode support. It's a bigger job than for most
    other MS fonts, because the CT fonts all have proper smallcap support."
