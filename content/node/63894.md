  luck - distinctive high bar on the G. Thought it might be DIN or Univers but no.
  Thought maybe Trade Gothic but that's got a spur on the G. Help!\r\n\r\nThanks!

  body: Unfortunately not. I checked Trade Gothic. See the other words bottom of the
    graphic has "MESSAGE US" - the G has no spur and a very high bar.
