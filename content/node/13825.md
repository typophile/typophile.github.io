  and the wiki cannot handle accented category names (such as the umlaut), it is difficult
  to figure out which Romanization to use! \"D\xFCrer\" is often spelled \"Durer\"
  in English, but the correct spelling is actually DUERER, if an umlaut cannot be
  used.</em>\r\n\r\nSee [[Albrecht Duerer]] for the complete wiki entry."
