  optical.\r\nBut is it a good practice to use different overshot values based on
  the character shape itself?\r\nI've attached the following image below to illustrate
  my thought? \r\n\r\nThe point is, should i use a value of 10 to 15 upm for the first
  character based on it's circular shape, and maybe something like 8 to 10 upm on
  the second one because it's more rectangular than the first one? \r\nIs this a common
  practice or is that variation optically irrelevant?\r\n\r\nHope i'm making sense\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    of the \"weight\" of the stroke is closer to the baseline (or other vertical alignment
    zone, x-height, cap height, whatever).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
