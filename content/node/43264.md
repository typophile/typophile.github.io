body: "<strong>The Cantillation  on the Ten Commandments</strong>  \r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Exodus
  20:2</em>\r\nThe Ten Commandments are unique since they are punctuated with  two
  systems of cantillation: upper cantillation marks (ta\u2019am elyon \u05D8\u05E2\u05DD
  \u05E2\u05DC\u05D9\u05D5\u05DF)  and lower cantillation marks (ta\u2019am tachton
  \u05D8\u05E2\u05DD \u05EA\u05D7\u05EA\u05D5\u05DF). While the upper cantillation
  marks divide the passage into ten Commandments, the  lower cantillation marks  divide
  it into twelve verses. What is the reason for having  upper  and  lower cantillation
  marks? How do we know which mark belongs to the  lower cantillation marks and which
  belongs to the  upper cantillation marks? \r\n\r\nThe cantillation marks are divided
  into two groups: disjunctive (separating)  and conjunctive (connecting). They serve
  three functions: musical, syntactical, and phonetical. The Poetical Books (Psalms,
  Job, and Proverbs) have a different system of cantillation marks than the Prose
  Books or 21 Books. \r\n Let's examine an example.  In Genesis 29:9 we find this
  verse \u05D5\u05E8\u05D7\u05DC \u05D1\u05D0\u05D4 , and in Genesis 29:6 this verse:
  \u05D5\u05D4\u05E0\u05D4 \u05E8\u05D7\u05DC \u05D1\u05EA\u05D5 \u05D1\u05D0\u05D4
  . \r\nThe word ba'a (\u05D1\u05D0\u05D4   come, arrive )  is identical in both past
  and present tense. Which one is the present, or past tense? Maybe both are past
  tense, or present? For example, if we read the word as a past tense (came), instead
  of a present tense (comes),  we  could misinterpret the meaning of the verse: And
  Rachel came, or And here comes Rachel? The cantillation marks help us in clarifying
  the correct meaning. In  the first sample (1a) the accent is on the first syllable
  \u2014 past tense. Whereas in  the second sample (1b) the accent is on the second
  syllable \u2014 present tense. \r\nThere are  other instances that verses are divided
  into  two independent clauses:  the first half is marked  and ended by  etnachta
  and the second half is marked  and ended by siluk. Both of these marks are disjunctive.
  \ Now, remember this  rule: etnachta  may appear only once in any verse . This rule
  also applies to the siluk (1). \r\n\r\n<em>The word avadim \u05E2\u05D1\u05D3\u05D9\u05DD</em>\r\nThe
  most interesting  and exceptional Commandment, or verse is <cite>I  am the LORD
  your GOD</cite> which has two or three sets of cantillation marks. The word avadim
  \u05E2\u05D1\u05D3\u05D9\u05DD is punctuated with both etnachta and siluk. The latter
  creates a short verse: <cite>I  am the LORD  your GOD...the house of bondage</cite>.
  whereas the former creates a longer verse: <cite>I am the LORD  your GOD...You shall
  have no other gods besides Me</cite> (sample 2).\r\nWhich verse belongs to the upper
  or the  lower cantillation marks?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HebSamples_3845.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn
  MS Sassoon 24\xBA 5702  there are marginal notes at the beginning of  most verses.
  Those notes  refer to the lower cantillation marks  with the words: Ta'ma kadma
  (\u05D8\u05E2\u05DE\u05D0 \u05E7\u05D3\u05DE\u05D0 ), which can be translated as
  the first cantillation (2). That said, the etnachta (avadim \u05E2\u05D1\u05D3\u05D9\u05DD
  ) which creates  the longer verse,  belongs to the lower cantillation marks.\r\n\r\n<em>The
  Revi'a & The Nine  Commandments</em>\r\nIn 1524-6  the second edition of the Rabbinic
  Bible, Mikra'ot Gedolot,   was published in Venice. This edition, according to Prof.
  Rabbi Mordechai Breuer, was the first one to add the third cantillation system  \u2014
  \ the revi'a (disjunctive).  This  system  also imposed new order: The lower system
  became the upper, and the upper the lower.\r\n\r\nSince then, different editions
  of the Hebrew Bible were published with three sets of cantillation marks, or two,
  but with revi'a.\r\nFor example, If we read the Adi bible that was published in
  1965, it is hard not to notice that the word avadim \u05E2\u05D1\u05D3\u05D9\u05DD
  is punctuated with etnachta, siluk, and revi'a (sample 3). Moreover, the order of
  the marks was changed. Originally the  etnachta  had been  written first, and the
  siluk second. Now the siluk is written first.  The order is also  changed in the
  word mebeyt \u05DE\u05D1\u05D9\u05EA. Now the merkha is  written first, and the
  \ munah  second. We also find  the revi'a  in Sinai bible that was published in
  1978, however, without the etnachta (3). \r\n\r\nWhy is avadim \u05E2\u05D1\u05D3\u05D9\u05DD
  \ punctuated with revi'a? \r\nLet's start with the fact that there is no single
  MS that shows any evidence for that mark. The etnachta and siluk are the most evident
  marks in  every MS. There is no doubt that the punctuators  tried to solve an issue
  based  on the musical rules of the cantillations, but failed to know, understand,
  and recognize the syntactical rules:\r\nFirst,   a  clause  governed by a revi'a
  must be subdivided by pazer, and not zaqef, on the word elohekha  \u05D0\u05DC\u05D4\u05D9\u05DA.
  Hence,  the  zaqef can subdivide  only the clause governed by the etnachta. \r\nSecond,
  \ as I stated already, the order of the etnachta and siluk had been changed. That
  said, the lower canitillation  system ends on the word avadim \u05E2\u05D1\u05D3\u05D9\u05DD
  with the siluk (and not the etnachta,  and siluk on the word al panay \u05E2\u05DC-\u05E4\u05E0\u05D9),
  and the upper  canitillation  system includes the two Commandments as one long verse,
  or one Commandment:\r\n <cite>I am the LORD your GOD...those who love me and keep
  my commandments</cite>.\r\n\"\u05D0\u05E0\u05DB\u05D9 \u05D9\u05D4\u05D5\u05D4 \u05D0\u05DC\u05D4\u05D9\u05DA...
  \u05D5\u05DC\u05E9\u05DE\u05E8\u05D9 \u05DE\u05E6\u05D5\u05EA\u05D9\"\r\n\r\nSo,
  we have only nine Commandments?  Let's assume for a second that we don't know if
  we need to have ten Commandments. \r\nThe custom by the Masora was to state the
  number of the verses at the end of each book in the Hebrew Bible. At the end of
  the Book of Exodus there are 1,209 verses. This number goes hand in hand  only if
  we count or read the  Decalogue  as 12 verses, according to the  lower cantillation
  marks. At the end of parashat Yitro  there are 72  verses. This number  goes hand
  in hand  only if we count or read the  Decalogue as 10  Commandments, according
  to the upper cantillation marks.  \r\n\r\nThird,  the revi'a clause creates one
  more problem, which resulted from incorporating  the two Commandments into one.
  Now we have one etnachta on the  word avadim \u05E2\u05D1\u05D3\u05D9\u05DD , and
  a second etnachta on the word leson'ai  \u05DC\u05E9\u05E0\u05D0\u05D9 . Do you
  remember the rule: etnachta  may appear only once in any verse!\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Norzi,
  di Lonzano, Hizekuni</em>\r\nInteresting to note that both Rabbi Jedidiah Norzi,
  the author of Minhat Shai on the Torah (16th century, Italy) and Rabbi Menahem di
  Lonzano, the author of Or Torah (16th century, Turkey) didn't see the problem with
  both etnachtas. However, they didn't accept the revi'a. Hizekuni,  (Rabbi  Hezekiah
  ben Manoah, 13th century, France), on the other hand, accepted the revi'a (with
  both etnachtas). In his commentary on Exodus, he writes: \r\n\u05D2\u05DD \u05D1\u05D3\u05D1\u05E8\u05D5'
  [\u05D1\u05D3\u05D1\u05E8\u05D5\u05EA] \u05D0\u05E0\u05DB\u05D9 \u05D5\u05DC\u05D0
  \u05D9\u05D4\u05D9\u05D4 \u05DC\u05DA, \u05D9\u05E9 \u05E0\u05D2\u05D9\u05E0\u05D4
  \u05D2\u05D3\u05D5\u05DC\u05D4, \u05DC\u05E2\u05E9\u05D5\u05EA\u05DF \u05E4\u05E1\u05D5\u05E7
  \u05D0\u05D7\u05D3, \u05DC\u05D6\u05DB\u05E8\u05D5\u05DF \u05E9\u05D1\u05D3\u05D1\u05D5\u05E8
  \u05D0\u05D7\u05D3 \u05E0\u05D0\u05DE\u05E8\u05D5\r\nHizekuni  considers the first
  and second Commandments as one Commandment, since they were spoken in one declaration
  (dibbur)  \"from the mouth of the Almighty\".  That was also the point of view of
  Rabbi Norzi, and Rabbi di Lonzano (4). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last issue to solve is
  our  first question: What is the reason for having  upper  and  lower cantillation
  marks?\r\nBoth systems came from two different sources: one is the Babylonian  Masora
  (the East, upper cantillation marks), the second is the Palestinian (the West, lower
  cantillation marks), or the  Land of Israel. This is one of the remarkable cases
  that the Tiberian Masora didn't reject  the Babylonian  Masora (5).\r\n\r\nWhen
  do we read the Decalogue? According to Jewish tradition, the Ten Commandments were
  given to Moses on Mount Sinai on Shavout (Festival of Weeks). The Ashkenazi custom,
  which was established by Hizekuni, is to read the  Decalogue with the upper cantillation
  on Shavuot, and on the weekly reading with the lower cantillation.  The Sephardic
  custom is to read  the Decalogue with the upper cantillation, whereas the lower
  cantillation is not meant for public reading, and only for private reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\u2022

  to these rules, however, those are not of our current discussion. See  Breuer, Ta'amey,

  research.   Pages 361-2    summarize the main features of this  MS. \r\n\r\n(3).
  Later Adi editions  didn't use the revi'a at all. The Hebrew-English edition by
  Sinai  was published in 1971  without revi'a.\r\n\r\n(4). Jedidiah Norzi, Minhat
