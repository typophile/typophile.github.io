  body: "Could have been derived from a Bodoni _fi_ ligature [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BodoniAntiquaDemiBoldAs_fj_6132.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bodoni-antiqua/\r\nwith
    the wide _f_ mirrored and flipped to provide the bottom stroke on the _j_, and
    the width adjusted to narrow the distance between the vertical strokes to account
    for the loss of the serifs at the base of _i_.\r\nDon"

  body: "Easy way is still to start with a ligature _fi_ and tinker until the designer
    produces what is desired. The period in my sample is perfectly round and could
    easily be pasted at the terminal with a nice little connecting curve to smooth
    the transition at the crotch.\r\nBTW to match this logo the period would have
    to be squooshed slightly so that it was wider than high.\r\nCould do the whole
    thing from scratch, but this is a lot quicker.\r\nDon "

  body: "Definitely a Didot/didone base....\r\n\r\nOddly enough \"fj\" is a standard
    ligature in many fonts (h0w else are Norwegians going to make fjord look as good
    as what it describes?), though I agree with previous posters that this is customized.\r\n\r\nOtama
    Display Bold is very similar, and would be a good basis on which to recreate this
    look (sadly, the fj ligature is not one of its glyphs):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tim-donaldson/otama/"

  body: "The _fi_ ligature in Otama is simply the regular _f_ with a blank replacing
    the dot on _i_. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/OtamaBoldAs_fj_6099.gif] But
    the terminal on the _f_ could be slightly squooshed and the crotch rounded to
    match the logo. All that is needed is to stretch the top stoke of _f_ to increase
    the distance between the vertical stroke and the terminal. Ditto for _j_. Works
    for me.\r\nDon"

  body: "Here is a virtually perfect match to the ball and top stroke of _fj_ which
    also works flipped and mirrored for the bottom stroke and ball\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BentonModernDisplayBlack_fj_6468.gif]\r\nBenton
    Modern Display Black http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/benton-modern-display/
    \r\nSimply thin the vertical stroke of the ligature version of _f_ by moving the
    lhs towards the center, and the vertical stroke of the flipped mirrored _f_ used
    for_j_ by moving the rhs towards the center. Then replace the cove serifs with
    square ones and you are there.\r\nFor perfection slightly flatten the top stroke
    of _f_ and bottom stroke of _j_.\r\nDon"
