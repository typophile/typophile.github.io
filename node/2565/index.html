E.g., U+706 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->should<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be there, but instead U+0E49 is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, when I turn on aliasing, all the diacritics completely disappear. Huh? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyone ever encountered this sort of thing?

		<div class="commentbody">OK, so I think I figured out what the problem isnow it's just a matter of developing some sort of cheap work around. Hopefully one that's not too clumsy. If anyone's listening to me talk to myself, feel free to chime in with your opinion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(1) Flash only enjoys working with the native codepage of the OS that it's working with. So Flash on my US version of Windows XP spits out the text formatting from the the 874 Thai codepage. So that: as I'm typing, Windows handles the text processing &amp; all is good, but when I'm done Flash takes over and fu©ks it all up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(2) It's possible to call up Unicode points using variables in dynamic text fieldswhich seems like it would sort everything out. But it's [seemingly] impossible to embed the necessary characters from the PUAso this too is useless. Well, since the end user would have to have the font installed to see things correctly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(3) It's also possible to use external UTF8 encoded files (a la Notepad) to generate Unicode characters in Flash, but the same embedding problems apply. I don't know the Actionscripting for that anyway :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The solution:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(1) Theoretically, users running Windows Thai edition won't have any problem using the font as it conforms to the 874 codepage. So in this case no fix is necessary.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[<!-- raw HTML omitted -->downfall:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I still need to test this on Windows Thai] <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(2) It seems, for 2000 and XP users, that a font could be built using GPOS and GSUB to do the vowel positioning and/or substitution. I.e., the vowels could be removed from the PUA,placed in points in the 1252 codepage, and that way they could be embedded in Flash.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[<!-- raw HTML omitted -->downfall:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> apps &amp; OSs that don't like GPOS &amp; GSUB will be screwed] <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(3) Or I could build a propietary keyboard driver, and map the variously positioned vowels (once again, placed in the 1252 page) to different key combinations.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->[<!-- raw HTML omitted -->downfall:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> non-standard and clumsy text imput method] <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Argh.</div>

Artists &amp; farmers mostly. One of them lives upstairs and has a localized Thai OS, but he's in Chiang Mai until the end of the month. So testing isn't a huge problem - just a waiting issue. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the meantime, I've figured out how to make the diacritics and vowels sit in the right places by using ActionScript to import UTF-8 encoded .txt files. But I still can't alias and/or embed the fonts without problems. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've thrown together <!-- raw HTML omitted --> a file comparing several fonts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - and I'm led to believe it's an issue with Flash and not with the fonts. I've got Unity Progress' Dillenia, PSL's Chamnarn, Norasi (which is one of Yannis Haralambous' fonts), Tahoma, and my Daasaang.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(1) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> aliasing seems to work fine now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; (2) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> embedding causes the diacritics to shift<!-- raw HTML omitted -->; (3) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> aliasing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> embedding causes the diacritics to disappear<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

		<div class="commentbody">Jesus and Mary. So I figured out how to add my own custom embedding range for the Thai characters in the PUA. Thought I was on the home stretch. Had already opened the champagne even. But when I embed (choosing Basic Latin, Thai, &amp; my custom PUA) I still get my jacked up glyphs.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So&hellip;until I embed, I assume Windows is handle glyph processing. I.e., Windows is controlling which glyphs appear for which character code. At that point, in the right contexts, 0xE9 is being represented by any of u+0E49, u+F706, u+F70B, or u+F714. [based on certain APIs, correct?]  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Once I embed however, it seems that Windows glyph processing is beaten down by Flash's big clumsy stick. Even though my PUA glyphs are [supposedly] embedded, they're no longer being called. Notice below that (1) the first cluster's tone mark is too high, (2) is perfect, (3)vowel collides with the ascender, &amp; (4) well, the consonant should be subbstituted so you can see the vowel below. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm working under the impression - correct me if I'm way off base - that even though Flash is somewhat Unicode savvy, it works with the codepage of your OS. So, theoretically, if I localize my machine (XP Pro) for Thai, Flash shouldn't have problems with the Thai codepage. But that's not what I'm seeing. I'm getting the same output whether I'm localized for English, Thai, or a good ol' southern drawl.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is there a way around this? I'm beginning to feel even dumber than usual. I'm starting to dream about this for Chrissakes.</div>
