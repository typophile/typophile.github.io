  I use fonts to create wedding invitations in Latvian language. As most of free fonts
  available do not have glyphs that are in my language (such as \u0100\u0112\u012A\u010C\u0160
  etc), I used HighLogic FontCreator to add missing glyphs and everything went well
  for me. (I never resell or redistribute fonts).\r\nBut now I have an OpenType font
  that is missing just one glyph - Imacron. As the FontCreator does not allow me to
  save edited OTF font back to its original OpenType and I do love the OpenType features,
  I had to search for other software.\r\nI purchased the FontLab 5 software, generated
  my missing glyph and assigned it with unicode 012A. When I test font using the softwares
  Quick Test As feature, it writes my letter \u012A perfectly, but when I generate
  font and install it, it does not show my created \u012A.\r\nI would greately appreciate
  any help on this, because I already suspect that the solution probabbly is something
  very simple...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nLiva"

    with different name and installed it as that and my new glyph works seemlessly!  Well
    I did say it will be something simple :)
