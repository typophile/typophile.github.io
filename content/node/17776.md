    More idiosyncratic.

    body: "Similar in a lot of respects, but not all.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase 'e' on
      this cover has a slanted middle line -- about 30 degrees up. Goldenbook's 'e'
      has a horizontal line.\r\n\r\nThe capital G on this cover has a sort of spike
      serif pointing straight up from the top right tip -- Goldenbook has little or
      no serif there. (Hard to tell at the sample size in the linked page.)\r\n\r\nThe
      capital G is flatter -- i.e. closer to square -- on the cover.\r\n\r\nThe lower-right
      vertical section of the capital G is much thicker in Goldenbook.\r\n\r\nThe
      place where the upper curve of the lower-case 'n' meets the left vertical section
      is lower on the cover than in Goldenbook. Same in the lowercase 'r'.\r\n\r\nThe
      two curves of the capital B are almost equal in width on the cover, but in Goldenbook
      the upper curve is noticeably narrower than the lower.\r\n\r\nIn general the
      serifs are larger on the cover than in Goldenbook.\r\n\r\nLike the capital G,
      the capital O is also closer to square on the cover than in Goldenbook.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
      for the try, though. Anyone have other guesses?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nWangden\r\n"
