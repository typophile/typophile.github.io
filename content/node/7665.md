  body: Yes and the bottom one is Impact, we&#39;ve been through this <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/53119.html?1100027200"
    target="_blank">before</a> but she&#39;s asking about the hand-drawn looking font
    buried in the other type. I can&#39;t see it well enough for an ID.

  body: Yes, I didn&#39;t realize that the other was still current.  If you look within
    the coaster crazed text, there is a bluish tan &#34;coaster crazed written within.  That
    is the font I am looking for.  Please help.

  body: This is driving me crazy. I&#39;m almost positive I&#39;ve seen this typeface
    - thought it might be an older House Industries font &#40;nope&#41;, checked Fonthead
    &#40;nope&#41;, Chank &#40;nope&#41;. I may check a few other places. I particularly
    noticed the &#34;c&#34; how it is thicker at the bottom, as well as the &#34;r&#34;.
    This could be a needle in a haystack among all the handwritten, brushstroke freeware
    fonts out there...
