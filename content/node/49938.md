body: "I'm thinking about designing a font with some special characteristic to use
  in some browser based exercises to be used to learn machine steno with.  My plan
  is to start with a simple mono spaced, sans-serif font that closely matches the
  steno machines output, apply some transformations, e.g. slant initial side consonants
  to the right, final side consonant to the left - lines up with the angle of the
  hand producing them.  That should be fairly straight forward, but the next bit is
  a little tricky.\r\n\r\nIn a line of steno, characters can only appear in one position,
  \"STKPWHRAO*EUFRPBLGTSDZ\", the letters to the left of the 'A', are known as the
  'initial consonants', those after the 'U' are the final consonants.  There is a
  'typewritten' short hand to represent a series of lines, (strokes, in the lingo),
  that goes as follows: '/' - for the start of a new stroke followed by any of the
  characters used in the stroke with these hints, to make the 'outline', unique; if
  no initial consonant is in the outline, a hyphen acts as a placeholder for their
  absence (unless a vowel is present, in which case it is not needed), if only initial
  consonants are present, then they are followed by a hyphen so you can tel that they
  are initial.  Here is an example: \r\n/THEUS /S- /A /DAUG /-FPLT  -- for \"This
  is a dog.\"\r\n\r\nTo have outlines appear as they would on a steno tape, I'm thinking
  that I could use the lowercase font positions for the initial consonants, (even
  though I'll have capitals in them), the capitals for the final side consonants but
  have the font specify a left-hand start (origin?) that corresponds to the left edge
  of the tape, and have \"no width?\" to the character so all the characters in a
  stroke overlap to create the look of the steno on the tape.\r\n\r\nSo taking the
  'this' above, drop the carriage return for the '/', translate the character to \"thEUS\",
  and then have it show as :\r\n\r\n T   H    EU       S\r\n_T___H____EU_______S  -
  just to show the format in case spaces get eaten in this post.\r\n\r\nI think this
  is possible, but I'm not sure, and even if it is I don't have the right terminology.\r\n\r\nThinking
  of inkscape to fontforge for tools.\r\n\r\nIs this do-able the way I'm thinking
  or am I off base?\r\n\r\nAny advice welcomed.\r\n\r\nTom Fetherston"

  body: It might not be too hard to build an animated interactive steno simulator
    in Flash. I don't think you'd even need a custom font for it--- you can skew the
    text either way as needed. I'd have to look up how exactly to do it, though.

  body: "Flash probably could do what I want, but a lot of this would be simpler if
    I used a custom font.\r\n\r\nI simple terms I'm looking to have a font with characters
    that are twenty two normal characters wide, that all superimpose on each other,
    i.e. after a newline, all the characters display themselves from an origin that
    is the left edge of the text area with no \"advance character width\" before printing
    the next character.\r\n\r\nI'd only need twenty two characters to cover the letters
    a steno machine can produce, which leaves lots of characters available for special
    effects, e.g. overlays that hint at the fingering needed.\r\n\r\nI'm also thinking
    of using a half slivered mirror to superimpose this on the keyboard, so I could
    have a duplicate, but mirroring version. \r\n\r\nTom FEtherston"
