  also featured on the menu at Steak 'n Shake. I've searched high and low and I can't
  find! It's driving me nuts.\r\n\r\nHere's two examples from Sonic (sorry for the
  lack of size):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sonic_type_4129.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  two from Steak 'n Shake:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/steaknshake_type_5884.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  thought about it being a corporate font, but I am not sure that the same company
  owns both places. Any help would be appreciated!"
