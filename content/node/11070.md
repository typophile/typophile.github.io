  a term I think she invented, called &#34;intasis&#34;, which is the opposite of
  entasis; like in Optima. I like it. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' the correct meaning of the word &#34;entasis&#34; is &#34;&#40;being&#41;
    in tension / tendency&#34;...  <BR>the opposite of this term would be &#34;adraneia&#34;
    which means &#34;in-activity&#34;...  <BR> <BR>anyway, if you say in greek that
    something is in &#34;entasis&#34;, then you mean that something is very strong...
    <BR> <BR>so i don&#39;t know, if soren&#39;s explanation &#40;in other words,
    &#39;entasis&#39; is the conception of &#39;helping &#34;less&#34; to look &#34;the
    same&#34; by turning it into &#34;more&#34;&#39;&#41; is okay...  <BR> <BR>&#34;entasis&#34;
    is the phenomenon which leads to the action of the conception... and not the action
    itself... <BR> <BR>but maybe i&#39;m wrong and the danish altered the meaning
    of this term for their vocabulary... <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>ps: as far as for the dictionary, you will be amused to
    get to know what happened here in greece with the greek version of bringhurst&#39;s
    &#34;elements&#34;... george matthiopoulos and michael makrakis of the greek font
    society &#40;gfs&#41; who edited and translated this book, tried to introduce
    new typographic terms and invented some terms which didn&#39;t exist in greece...
    this lead of course to a discussion with some other &#34;experts&#34; on how correct
    the new terminology is and &#34;why using your term and not mine&#34;... greeks
    are so funny... '
