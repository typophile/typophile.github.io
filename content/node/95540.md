  type family\"</strong>\r\n\r\nsee http://typophile.com/node/95280\r\n\r\ndeals only
  with licensing matters and not with the font itself, I open here a new thread to
  draw the attention to strange technical peculiarities of this new font.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I heard of this font here at Typophile, I download it and made a lot of printouts
  for testing purposes. At first I thought: Wow, a great new sanserif font, and available
  for free at that. \r\n\r\nBut when I studied all the printouts made on my  laser
  printer in more detail, I came to the conclusion that all the weights of this font
  family must have been generated automatically or mechanically in a faulty way with
  the detrimetal consequence that all the caps heights and x-heights and ascender
  heights are different in different weights.\r\n\r\nWhen you open a professional
  font, e.g. Adobe's Myriad font, with a font editor, you will find that the caps
  heights of all weights are identical. For instance, the uppercase \"U\" of Myriad
  OpenType has a caps height of 674 units as regular weight and as semibold weight
  and as bold weight and as black weight, that is, all the caps heights of the same
  letters are identical in different weights. That is what you expect from a professional
  font, otherwise the letters in a line of text would not align properly.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  if you open the new font Source Sans Pro with a font editor, you will find that
  the caps heights and the x-heights of all weights are entirely different with the
  consequence the letters in a line of text do not align properly.\r\n\r\nHave a look
  at the picture <strong>vertical.jpg</strong> attached below. What you see in this
  picture is the capital \"I\" of Source Sans Pro in roman, semibold, bold, and black
  (from left to right).\r\n\r\nThe vertical dimensions of the capital \"I\" are as
  follows:\r\n\r\nRoman: 656 units\r\nSemibold: 654 units\r\nBold: 652 units\r\nBlack:
  650 units\r\n\r\nThe bizarre logic for uppercase letters seems to be this:\r\n\r\n<strong>The
  blacker the uppercase letter, the smaller the vertical dimension.</strong>\r\n\r\nNow,
  if you measure the vertical dimensions of the lowercase \"u\", you will find these
  dimensions:\r\n\r\nRoman: 486 units\r\nSemibold: 491 units\r\nBold: 496 units\r\nBlack:
  500 units\r\n\r\nThe bizarre logic for lowercase letters seems to be this:\r\n\r\n<strong>The
  blacker the lowercase letter, the larger the vertical dimension.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat
  is your opinion?"

  body: "The second of these findings does not surprise me at all: it is quite common
    for the bolder weights of a type to have a slightly taller x-height than the lighter
    weights, as this allows compensation for horizontal reduction of interior counter
    space and makes the design of complex shapes such as the lowercase a easier. Similarly,
    the x-height of lowercase italic letters are often shorter than those of their
    roman companions in order to provide optical correction for the longer diagonal
    stems, which can appear taller than identical height straight stems.\r\n\r\nThe
    variation in the height of caps is surprising though."

  body: "Alignment is not as important as apparent size.\r\nRelative vertical proportions
    of ascender, x-height and descender are also relevant, which may explain the variation
    in cap height.\r\n\r\nIf you think there is a problem with the dimensions mentioned
    here, it would be best to illustrate it with a specimen of \u201Creal\u201D running
    text, rather than in the abstract.\r\n\r\nMany well-established faces have x-heights
    which vary according to weight.\r\nGill Sans, for instance.\r\nIt\u2019s a practice
    which I\u2019ve implemented in many of my designs."

  body: "In FF Ernestine* there's an increase of 4 units (Em = 1000) between each
    of Light, Regular, Demi and Bold, for each of: x-height, cap height, ascender
    height and descender depth. People seem to agree that lining up the baseline remains
    sacrosanct, even in a text face. In display typography lining things up is much
    more important.\r\n\r\n* http://ernestinefont.com/\r\n\r\nI agree with John that
    going the other way with the caps is peculiar, but maybe it's this: cap diacritics
    -which go over the em a good deal- might need more room the darker they get.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    or are these differences noticeable (assuming it is possible to be objective,
    post-analysis) in, for example, running text at 12pt? John Hudson posted [[http://typophile.com/node/80386|last
    year]] about his requirement for a script to harmonise stem widths in a typeface
    he was developing and I am curious about how detremental this would actually be
    from a purely visual perspective."

  body: "Uli, \r\nAs everybody said, this is completely normal for optical compensation.\r\n\r\nIt's
    also a side-effect of interpolating from only 2 masters (Regular and Black).\r\nIn
    bigger families, people usually use 3 masters (Thin, Regular and Black) so there
    is no difference in x-height, Ascender, etc. from the Thin to the Regular. But
    then again, they slowly increase from the Regular as it reach the Black weight.\r\n\r\nIdeally,
    the vertical metrics will remain unchanged in the middle weights, and will only
    increase/decrease as they reach the thinnest and blackest extremes. But using
    lots and lots of masters for interpolation is not very practical, as each master
    increase the complexity and the chance of inconsistencies."

  body: In the low res digital age, little inconsistencies like this had better add
    up to huge optical advantages. Huge. But it's probably a lot better than any free
    fonts we ever release.

  body: "Uli, again: that \"inconsistency\" is not a bug, it's a feature. Some people
    even make the \"z\" shorter than the other letters (because it's the only lc with
    large \"border\" horizontals). Like Adrian Frutiger. Professional. It is in fact
    impressive (and maybe disconcerting...) that a free font has such subtleties.\r\n\r\nFiona
    Ross said something cool during her presentation in Yerevan in June: \"For things

  body: "The vertical proportions are based on Robert Slimbach\u2019s guidance to
    me according to his ever-evolving theories of reading optics. The basic premise
    is that capital letters and letters with extenders appear larger the heavier their
    weight is. The differences you noted are subtle enough to be noticed in print
    and to my eyes, Robert\u2019s guidance proves true: the various weights do seem
    better suited to each other than if they were consistent across the range of weights.
    In proofs that kept ascenders and descenders consistent with the regular weight,
    the extenders seemed a bit cramped in the ExtraLight weight and a bit long in
    the Black master. In low-resolution settings these small deviations are not present
    thanks to hinting instructions that keeps vertical dimension parameters consistent
    across a range of weights."

    x-height letters behave the other way?\r\n\r\nBTW, I think that's the closest

    me some eight or nine years ago.\r\n\r\nI was stubborn, however, and had pretty
    severe misgivings about varying the cap height across weights in Hypatia Sans.
    In the end I kept the cap height consistent across weights. I'm willing to believe
    that could have been a mistake, though I guess it is reassuring to see that it
    is still a contentious question!\r\n\r\nOn the side, those single-unit variations
    in stroke widths may be the result of interpolation in multiple master space."
