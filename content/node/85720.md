body: " these typeface were human, what personality would you think they will be.
  (male/female/personality/attitude/occupation) I really want each of the types to
  relate to fashion somehow. Could be...Couture, Avante Garde, ...but yeah (if its
  not possible its okay)....tell me what you think.\r\nHere are the types. \r\n\r\nmodern
  n.20 /in my opinion/ (strong women. and she have some sort of secret but she won't
  tell)\r\navant garde bold /in my opinion/     (no effin idea)\r\ndidot italic light
  \         (sophisticated, and very fragile ballerina,\r\nverlag condensed bold    /in
  my opinion/   (no idea)\r\npalatino        men in suits with cigar...a little bit
  of d&g feel..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplease please tell me what you guys think. :( i am
  stuck.\r\nThanks a bunch."
