  body: They show an attention to usage and need of the designer who might use the
    typefaces. What do you think of them?

    when printed on an offset press at 2400 to 3200 dpi.

  body: I&#39;d be curious to really get in close and compare the differences. I&#39;ve
    seen some type that is simply interpolated to get different weights--painfully
    apparent--and the designer has not done any sort of tweaking. However, I would
    think it a safe assumption that Mr. Stone has much more respect and care for the
    subtleties and wouldn&#39;t bother with those subtleties if he didn&#39;t see
    reason.

  body: '&#62; Interpolation is fine for minor tweaking of a <BR>&#62; font&#39;s
    weight. However if you really want to <BR>&#62; do &#34;Haloing&#34; right, you
    have to &#34;expand stroke&#34; <BR> <BR>? <BR>The extremes of a weight axis can
    be -and often are- generated by expand-stroke, and then cleaned up, and then you
    can interpolate wonderful Halo-style stuff. If it&#39;s good enough for generating
    a Regular and a Bold it&#39;s certainly good enough the generate minor weight
    differences. That said, if you care about such subtle weight differences you also
    need to care about trapping: <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html"

    think this Halo idea -although not entirely original- is useful for a number of
    things, although some of them actually would treat the Halo cut as the primary
    and the &#34;normal&#34; as the alternate. Besides light-on-dark setting, it&#39;s
    useful for balancing color in settings with slightly different point sizes&#42;,
    fighting gain Poynter-style, and also letterpess printing. <BR> <BR>&#42; And
    this relates to the wonderful &#34;semi-fake&#34; smallcaps approach - it&#39;s
    really quite adequate most of the time. <BR> <BR>BTW, one strange thing is how
    he seems to be using websafe colors, still. Look at the unpleasant pattern in
    that brick color &#40;on the site&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    <BR> <BR>Really? For some professional type designers I know, including myself
    its not how we proceed at all. Well, perhaps it work a bit better on Sans, but
    not for a serif.&#42; Its more fast to design them. Type design is not a game
    who can be done with tricks such that one, I can assure you. <BR> <BR>Only for
    really minor overall adujstment of weight, sometimes weight functions can be used,
    but as all functions, the system is too stupid to do correct job. Last, semi fake
    small caps work mostly for Sans. <BR> <BR>&#42; see that, <a href="http://www.porchez.com/article/266/january-2005-type-projects">last

  body: Just to be clear, I didn&#39;t mean using <i>only</i> expand-stroke; for one
    thing you certainly have to shift the contrast &#40;more for dark weights and
    less for light&#41; manually afterwards. But my point was that <i>interpolation</i>
    itself is fine for virtually any design, assuming the extremes are clean. Proof
    that it works well? De Groot. <BR> <BR>hhp

    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Still, adding weight via a function do worst job than doing
    it manually specially when its extremes. Specially when you do MM or interpolation
    after, because with adding weight via afunction, you never be sure where you add
    points and it always destruct most of your forms, like serif structure and so
    on. <BR> <BR>When I say extreme, its really extreme, aka Extra light to Black,
    not Regular to Demi!!!... with five intermediate weights ;&#41;

  body: I have tried using expand stroke as well as Effects&#62;bold in FontLab.  I
    find the results almost useless.  I can draw the new weights from scratch faster
    and better than I can clean up the mess made by the transformations.  Once you
    draw the extremes, making inbetween weights using MM gives you a starting point
    that can be reasonably cleaned up but there is still old fashioned work involved.   <BR>
    <BR>I guess I just don&#39;t trust anything &#34;automatic&#34;--I still drive
    a manual shift car with crank-up windows.  Then again, I am just a cranky old
    man anyway :-&#41; <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: '&#34;Expand Stroke&#34; in Fontographer is very smooth. It does have difficulty
    with some curves, but I&#39;ve found that if I just &#34;split point&#34; at either
    end, that fixes it &#40;although I have to delete a few extra points after removing
    overlap&#41;. However, the new outlines are very &#34;parallel&#34; to the original,
    so it&#39;s worth it. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t had any success with Fontlab&#39;s
    &#34;Expand Strokes&#34; &#40;different from Effects &#62; Bold&#41; -- it gives
    me crooked, non-parallel lines, and new points in peculiar places. Perhaps I am
    doing something wrong, but as I prefer to create my glyphs in Fontographer anyway,
    I haven&#39;t tried to fix the problem.'

  body: My concern about Haloed fonts isn&#39;t about design directly. Its about how
    jobs get created. Lets say a designer uses the haloed font with a knock out in
    an ad. The ad flows along but when it gets to the production department the client
    now decides it should be a tint of color and an overprint. The designer by this
    time is working on 10 other projects and might even be bored with this one. Well
    it is in production. Another problem could be if a project leaves one agency and
    goes to another. They might know the typeface but might not have a clue about
    the haloed aspect. These are just some thoughts.
