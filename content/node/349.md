  body: 'The simple shapes remind me of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/horatio/light/testdrive.html?s=Splendour&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Horatio</a>, but the slight  <BR>thick-thin contrast and rounded
    stroke ends make me  <BR>believe this could be a contemporary &#39;nostalgia&#39;
    face. Also,  <BR>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s extended: I think the thick-thin
    contrast  <BR>is part of the design, not the result of mechanical extension. <BR>The
    &#39;o&#39; and &#39;e&#39; look too much like &#39;perfect&#39; circles, not  <BR>extended
    elipses. <BR> <BR><a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALET-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank"> Chalet</a> it probably ain&#39;t: it should be reminiscent Helvetica  <BR>&#40;Chalet
    60&#41;, ITC Bauhaus &#40;Chalet 70&#41; or ITC Avant Garde Gothic  <BR>&#40;Chalet
    80&#41;; the unifying flavor being ITC Avant Garde Gothic.'

    target=_top>jay</a> was paying attention to this thread he might say that  <BR>&#34;all
    real logos should be made with custom type!&#34;, so this may <BR>be one of those
    &#34;real logos&#34;.

  body: okay... <BR>thanx Tiff, Troubleman and Coles...   <BR>i was beginning to think
    you were avoiding my post..  for some reason.. <BR> <BR>i agree with you that
    it looks like some custom made... <BR>the letter   r    worx well with the other
    circled-shaped letters... but the   s   doesn&#39;t really fit in with them. <BR>
