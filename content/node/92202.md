  for designers throughout History. \r\nI found some books (like [[http://books.google.pt/books?id=AHq-uK6F-PUC&printsec=frontcover&hl=pt-PT&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|Typographic
  Specimens: The Great Typefaces]] ) and articles (like [[http://www.alistapart.com/articles/real-web-type-in-real-web-context/|Real
  Web Type in Real Web Context]]) and some posts here in Typophile like:\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/27291]]\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/52442]]\r\n\r\nBut,
  can anyone point out some more?\r\nThank you in advance.\r\nAnt\xF3nio."

    bought a copy, but have not read it yet.)\r\n\r\nAlso, in case it might be relevant:
    in the journal Codex there's an article that claims that the first ever typeface
    specimen was produced by Erhard Ratdolt.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Because specimens generally accord equal status to all a foundry\u2019s products.\r\nAnd
    because extant specimens do not represent all foundries.\r\nThe types that are
    most culturally signi\uFB01cant, being most representative of a time and place,
    i.e. those which were most popular, do not necessarily correspond to what one
    \uFB01nds in the specimens in libraries.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s much harder to write
    a type history from commercially produced documents (trade set), because it requires
    much forensic expertise and effort in identifying the types.\r\nAs an aside, here
    is the earliest trade use of a sans of which I am aware:\r\nhttp://pinterest.com/pin/49539664621179232/\r\nCompare
    with the best-known \uFB01rst sans, the 1816 Caslon, which has never been seen
    \u201Cin the wild\u201D."

  body: "Thank you nick. \r\nMy approach is more in terms of  understanding the construction
    (and evolution) of type specimens in different periods, not the types themselves.\r\nThe
    article  [[http://blog.eyemagazine.com/?p=5202|Specimaniac. In praise of type
    specimens, old and new, with Veer\u2019s Joe Newton]]  is good, but not to deep...\r\n\r\nFor
    example, the actual type specimens:\r\nshow off all of the characters in the set,
    and OT features, the typeface set in a realistic way somewhere so we can see how
    it will look like when they go to use it in \"real world\" setting, etc. \r\n\r\nOr
    even the Internet typessetters software as type specimens  ...\r\n\r\nWhat different
    types of type specimens can we see during History...\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n \r\n\r\n
