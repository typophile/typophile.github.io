    <BR> <BR>Here are some of my tattoos as requested for visuals by Stephen Coles.
    <BR>They are as best as I can shoot them with my digital camera for now by <BR>myself.  If
    you want better pictures, I can try to get someone to shoot <BR>them for me in
    a few days much better.  I have a few more as well that <BR>are not included here
    that I was simply unable to angle to shoot. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.astigmatic.com/AOEWRIST.JPG"

    <BR>&#40;Tattooed Lower Left Leg, Outer Side w/ Latin text &#34;Quinque Venenum:
    Vis <BR>Vires, Pecunia, Desiderium, Amor, Ego&#34; and below that is the amulet

    Forearm w/ &#40;from top to bottom&#41; Dutch word <BR>&#34;vasthoudenheid&#34;,
    Latin phrase &#34;Nitor expletio&#34;, and Tibetan prayer <BR>mantra &#34;Ohm

    <BR> <BR>I hope all these links work ok, have only posted a few times here, but
    <BR>never links.  I plan, over time, to continue having typographic tattoos <BR>added
    to fill my complete left side of my body, and varying the <BR>languages used as
    much as my ability to find translations of the texts I <BR>want added available.
    <BR> <BR>Hope the shots are of interest, let me know if you want me to have them
    <BR>shot better and I&#39;ll get that done in a day or two. <BR> <BR>- Astigmatic'
