  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>We&rsquo;re working on a logo design for a natural foods grocery co-op.</p>
<p>The typography is one of our biggest problems. Our name, &ldquo;New Pioneer food co-op&rdquo; just does not break in manageable ways. 
One solution I&rsquo;ve come up with is to scale &ldquo;new&rdquo; horizontally, but I know this will mangle the artfulness of the typeface. What do I need to consider to recreate a typeface with a broader horizontal scale? (e.g. are there rules of thumb for creating extended width characters, as there may be for creating condensed faces?)</p>
<p>Also, the attached image is primarily exploring EdGothic from House Industries. We do not own EdGothic, but will purchase it if we decide to use it in our logo. For the purposes of comping, I used House&rsquo;s LetterSetter, then did a rough vector trace of the resulting low res .gif. What is considered best practice for doing comps with fonts that you do not yet own?</p>

<p>How about making &lsquo;food co-op&quot; wider? By this I mean make each letter wider (design the 3 letters as extended, don&rsquo;t stretch them). To use more space, consider breaking the hyphen back out (not overlapped). At small sizes the overlapped hyphen may just make the 2 o&rsquo;s illegible. Co-op without a hyphen can be read as one wrong word.</p>
<p>Also consider hiring a lettering artist. Odd shapes and awkward breaks are part of their daily work. Since your existing efforts are all rustic, it would be no problem to draw it all custom.</p>
<p>Also consider having a logo with an organic (get it?) shape; if a letterer took this on, he/she might start with some more loose, lively, and less constrained layouts. All you need is balance, it&rsquo;s not required that a logo fit in a square.</p>
<p>Does New Pioneer have to be caps?</p>
<p>If you want to keep the elements you have, put the little leaf dingbat next to co-op to use up that space. Then you can stack &ldquo;NEW PIONEER&rdquo; on top of it for a tidy shape. Or use a nice leaf shape as the hyphen. Or&hellip;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Try setting the type in a circle. New Pioneer in the upper half and Food Co-op in the lower half. and place a graphic in the middle. It gives a level of importance (New Pioneer = name) (Food Co-op = what they are). Don&rsquo;t stretch the type. The type designer didn&rsquo;t design it to be stretched. One other thought do you really want the idenity to look cartoonish? I would take a more formal professional take to the look.</div>

This is what I was asking about. I know, for example, that when designing typefaces for small text sizes, certain alterations are made to the counters. What, if anything, is done to aid in designing an extended-width character? I&rsquo;m asking specifically to avoid stretching the character.</p>
<p>These are some good ideas, and I&rsquo;ll certainly look into them. Honestly, this project has been a terrible ordeal. In fact, the chief complaint about our store&rsquo;s previous (current) logo is that it is too cartoonish. On the other hand, our brief was focussed almost entirely on communicating that it is a fun place to shop. Thanks for the observation. It hadn&rsquo;t come up as being cartoonish yet, but if one sees it that way, a million are sure to follow.</p>
<p>edited to add the following confession:
Hopefully, none of the above sounds defensive or snappish. I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to work with identity stuff much, so it&rsquo;s incredibly important to me, but it&rsquo;s also identified a LOT of weaknesses I have as a designer. In short, I know I need plenty of help, but talking about this project makes me uptight. All comments and critiques are more than welcome.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">A fun place to shop doesn&rsquo;t have to reflect in the logo. It could be expressed in the marketing or in a tagline. Make your mark look like a quality place to shop. Thats a major reason to go there and leave the marketing to marketing.</div>
