body: So Im trying ti fugure out what the golden section for an 8.5&#34; x 11&#34;
  USA letter sized paper would be. I know how one would figure this out for a square,
  but what about something not square? how would I go about this? <BR> <BR> <BR>hildebrant.

  body: As far as know, Kyle, that would be impossible. The golden section is generally
    approximated by the ratio 1:1.618. Which, sadly for us, isn&#39;t a US letter
    sheet. Unless you trim it.  <BR> <BR>Nate

    square size? or am I crazy?

  body: 'US paper sucks. Why is it that we don&#39;t use metric? Anyway, after some
    fast long division, it seems that the closest &#40;cheapest and easiest&#41; you
    can get with US letter is to trim it to 11 x 6 13/16. That might be a resonable
    Golden Section. '

  body: One more approximation &#40;based on the Fibonacci series&#41; would be 233mm
    x 144mm.

  body: OK, so I forgot about this thread, but today while I was teaching I farted
    out a way to geometrically derive a golden section from ugly US paper. Take an
    11x17 sheet. Assume you&#39;re looking at it vertically. Draw a horizontal line
    11&#34; from the bottom to describe an 11&#34; square. Draw a horiz. line 5.5&#34;
    from the bottom to bisect the square. Draw a diagonal line from the bottom left
    corner to the top right corner of the lower half of the square. Rotate that line
    counterclockwise so that its arc hits the left edge of the paper approximately
    12.3&#34; from the bottom. Draw a horizontal line from that point. The area bounded
    by that line, the line at 5.5&#34;, and the left and right edges of the sheet
    should be a Golden Rectangle.  <BR> <BR>Although it would still be easier to trim
    your paper to 11 x 6 13/16&#34;. That&#39;s essentially what you&#39;ve just constructed.
    And with a lot less waste.
