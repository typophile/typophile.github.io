  body: "Good find Soha. In my opinion a multimillion dollar operation Like Fitzgeralds
    Casino/Hotel would have no problem in paying for a custom brand identity, rather
    than use an off the shelf font\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FitzgeraldsLasVegasSign_5919.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FitzgeraldLasVegasCard2_4542.jpg]\r\nIt
    seems to me that the Fitzgeralds designer took the letterforms shown in Steve
    Jackaman's Tarantula Script of 1997, or in already existing neon signage with
    freestanding letters, and put them into a sharp cornered running script for the
    big entrance way sign, business cards and other branded items.\r\nBTW there are
    changes in the branding http://lasvegasinsideout.com/fitzgeralds/\r\nOf course
    it is possible that a font designer had the same idea and produced a running script
    version of the Tarantula Script  letters. The design is rather obvious. There
    may indeed be a font with these characteristics.\r\nDon"
