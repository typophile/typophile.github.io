body: "Greetings everyone. Love some advice on type treatments for price lockups that
  look elegant on screen. Have a client who employs Helvetica Neue (licensed) as it's
  corporate type face and I'm struggling to  create an elegant system for displaying
  potentially verbose number amounts. Example: $329.87 looks fine small but at larger
  sizes gets clunky. Any thoughts or comments appreciated.\r\n\r\n"
