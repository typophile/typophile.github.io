body: "I've been asked a couple of times recently to sign papers for using fonts for
  specific uses that are not mentioned in my rather simple EULA. In general my License
  has a standard 5 user/devices limit. I never thought of spelling out specific uses,
  but that has been called into question.\r\nThe email I just received today asks
  about using one of my fonts for props for a Warner Brothers TV production. Last
  month I signed an amended agreement for someone that included some TV promotions,
  but it was a small scale client. So after all the paperwork and emails I sold 1
  standard license. Hardly worth the time. It seems ridiculous to do that for a major
  deal like this, but I fear my current EULA is not putting me in a position for negotiation.
  The only tweak it has that might be in my favor and might be why they are asking
  is where it says \"Use of this software beyond these parameters will require additional
  licensing. For large multi-end user licensing please contact Stephen Rapp at (my
  ph. number) for a quote.\"\r\n\r\nAny advice would be most appreciated."

  body: "As someone that has had to license for movie and television use before, I
    can tell you that the easier you make it, the more likely it is to be used. I've
    spec'd a typeface before and the foundry was so concerned about every single possible
    permutation of use that we just went with someone else to save us the hassle.
    \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, you should do whatever makes you comfortable, but
    please don't punish people for playing by the rules. It's an industry that has
    ignored licensing (for at least the 15 years that I've been doing it), and it
    looks like Frank Martinez's work is changing that opinion. Work with them.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    add a clause to your EULA that television and movie usage is on a case by case
    basis and that you'd be happy to work with the studio or agency. It's in both
    of your interests for it to get licensed."

  body: "Thanks, Cory.\r\nI'm typically not very fussy about uses at all. I always
    appreciate when people inquire about specific uses and typically am happy to see
    them use my designs. In this case I think because my EULA is not so detailed as
    some that WB wants to have some specifics spelled out. \r\nMy most recent email
    from him said that they typically treat that type of use more like 3rd party artwork
    rather than a generic font. So I think they want to make sure that I'm properly
    compensated. I've had at least one corporation buy a single user license for much
    broader applications that was not willing to even divulge the number of users
    involved. So I also appreciate the idea that a better license could help, though
    I'm not in any position to enforce things."

    like WB are trying to do the right thing and I'm sure everything will work out
    nicely for you both. Ha, wish I could get one of my typefaces sold for that sort
    of use! Good luck sir.\r\n\r\nHave you thought of having a third party look at
    your EULA and give you an audit of it? There are some people out there that do
    that sort of thing. Pretty certain several of them are regulars on this forum
    as well. That way you could have an objective look at what you're including and
    not \u2014 possibly  this could resolve your spelling things out issue?"

    I'm going to look into a EULA improvement. Stuart had apparently sold the same

    far. \r\n\r\nThanks for the advice."

    in the most high profile lawsuits against studios over font misuse. It was an
    assumption on my part based on 15 years of font licensing being ignored and being
    laughed at when I recommended the agency buy the typeface \u2014 now they are
    all very concerned about using licensed fonts.  The only difference I've seen
    is Frank. Quite possible it's something else, but I've not observed any other
    difference."

    of my fonts was used in Walt Disney Pictures lame-ass remake of \u201CThe Music

    Disney got a cool period font, I got bragging rights, end of story.\r\n\r\nOf

    am not really sure of a reason to treat licensing any differently in the latter
    instance: the total number of users is the total number of users, regardless of
    where they are geographically, as long as the corporate license covers them all.\r\n\r\nOTOH,
    if the fonts are mounted on a publicly-accessible server on the internet, then
    you have the thorny problem of exactly how many users you actually have, and how
    many of them are occasional or one-time users\u2014as in the case of customization
    of products, from wedding invitations to t-shirts. As I have advocated elsewhere,
    the only sensible approach\u2014to my fevered mind\u2014would be to impose and
    collect a one-time DRM fee at the point of sale, a task which <em>ought</em> to
    be simple enough to accomplish\u2026but, then, finding <strong>someone</strong>
