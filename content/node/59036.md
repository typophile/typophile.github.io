  body: Looks more like a Caslon to me, but I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes
    to pre-digital type.

  body: You may be right. I wonder if the angle of 7 was changed when digitized -
    that seems like a sort here that could help solve the mystery for somebody who
    knows metal types better than I do.

  body: "Because the original design for Janson goes back to Nicholas Kis in 1690,
    it's at least a plausible choice, from a historic standpoint, because this sample
    comes from an edition sometime after 1876. Do you know the edition's date?\r\n\r\n-
