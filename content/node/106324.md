body: "I wonder about a few options/checkboxes in Font Info > TrueType specific settings
  and Preferences > Generate OpenType & TrueType that I can\u2019t seem to find much
  info about. And, also a wildcard that I\u2019d like to discuss.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Automatically
  reorder glyphs. From what I have read, this only affects CFF-OT fonts in OS9 (not
  very relevant for me). <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/42382\">Karsten Luecke
  writes in another thread</a>: \u201CIn CFF-OT fonts, the first glyph must be .notdef.
  And in TT(-OT) fonts, the first four glyphs must be .notdef, .null, CR and space.\u201D
  I assume this talks about the glyph ID order. I wonder where/how I can inspect or
  modify this.\r\n\r\n\u2022 HDMX settings: What determines the sizes I should apply
  this for? The sizes I have hinted?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Copy HDMX data from base to composite
  glyph: I\u2019m not sure what this part means. Can anyone explain?\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Create VDMX table: I use some vertical delta instructions, so I assume FL is correct
  when it says I need to check it, but what does it actually do?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Re.
  kerning settings: When I am making webfonts, file size is very important. From what
  I\u2019ve read, browser support for a flat kerning table is as spotty as the support
  for OT class kerning. Also, people are pushing for OT support because that\u2019s
  the cool stuff. (And David Berlow only includes a selected few kerning pairs in
  the RE fonts. I can understand that for stuff that is only geared at text sizes,
  btw. Even the retina screen is lowres when it comes to kerning at text sizes.) So:
  I am only exporting OT class kerning. What are you doing? Why?\r\n\r\n\u2022 The
  two options \u201CWrite stored native TrueType hinting\u201D and \u201CExport visual
  TrueType hints\u201D. What are these referring to? "
