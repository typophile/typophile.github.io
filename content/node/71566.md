  design looking forward in improving my skills in typography (I suck at it).\r\nI
  have seen so many impressive works in this forum that I really wanted to join and
  learn from the masters :)\r\n\r\nRecently I got the job of creating a logo for an
  already established Civil Engineer Agency (builds and restore buildings), which
  requires a solid but, yet, quite modern and dynamic look. After a few tests here's
  what I'm up to :\r\n\r\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/i/amgprova5.jpg/\r\n\r\nAs you
  noticed, the logo is focused exclusively on type, but as I'm lacking the whole knowledge
  on the argument I can't improve it anymore. \r\n\r\nPlease, help me with your knowledge
  guys , I really need it!\r\n\r\nP.s: don't criticize the colours , those will be
  part of the final part in the design process, thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks very much
  for your attention,\r\n\r\nPierluigi"

  body: FWIW I think this looks fragile. It most certainly does not look "solid",
    for that the stroke weight needs to be much heavier or the type needs to be of
    a slab variety. Also the pointy joints in A and M spell "precision" and that translates
    more into the manufacturing and fabricating rather than building restoration.

    (don't worry - he's a local artist, and probably unknown in your area).\r\n\r\nThere's
    nothing to hold \"AMG\" and \"Engineering\" together. Maybe make \"Engineering\"
    the same width as \"AMG\" and thicken it up.\r\n\r\nI'd also come up with a second
    version of the logo to be used at smaller sizes, with thicker stencil breaks in
    the \"AMG\".\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Thanks, thanks and thanks! \r\n\r\nThat was exactly the kind of constructive
    critics I was searching for, unfortunetly I can't update immediately the changes
    as I am on holiday without Illustrator, but as soon as I come back I will update
    the logo.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions? I'm always hungry for constructive comments
    :P\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPierluigi"
