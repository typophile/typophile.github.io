body: We are currently in the early stages of designing a book to printed in both
  English and German editions. Does anyone know a good rule af thumb for how much
  the text length will increase once the translation into German occurs? <BR> <BR>A
  colleague of mine remembers an increase of around 30% in overall length. Can anyone
  confirm this figure or offer a more educated answer?  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance...

  body: I don&#39;t know about German, but my experience with English - French is
    that it varies according to the translator, and to which language you start with.
    <BR> <BR>So I would ask the editor or the translator, and put them on the spot!
