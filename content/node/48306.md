body: "...when they are vectorized on the computer.\r\n\r\nLately I've been working
  on a lot of ambigrams & hand-lettering. Something is definitely being lost in translation
  from the hand-rendered sketches to the vector graphics. I am good with Illustrator
  and have been using it for years (and Freehand when I first delved into graphic
  design, type, etc.) But lately, I've become extremely frustrated w/ my vector work.
  \r\n\r\nI am considering getting a Wacom tablet regardless, but I am hoping that
  might help ease my frustrations. Also, if could provide some suggestions on how
  you convert your sketches to the digital environment, that would be great. Do you
  scan & trace, or do you use a Wacom tablet, or use any other method? And of course...this
  applies mostly to type. ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestions, tips & tricks would be appreciated. "
