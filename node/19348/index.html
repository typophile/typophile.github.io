<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Dear Friends,
Referring to the MRALLAH.jpg that comprises all the Arabic Characters from Hamza-to-Ya, I would like to highlight the Smart, Attractive + Space-saving Features of the Arabic Script first.
Needless to say, the Arabic letter Ha has 4 shapes: the flower-like initial, the 8-like middle + the final that looks like either o or q depending on the letter coming before.
That's right: Virtually, Arabic letters Change shape —Tails not heads— in such a way that they:
1. join (connect) appropriately to neighbouring letters through short curves or straight lines. See (S+J) in Sojjadan + As-Sojood and how J joins D in the first and WAW in the latter.
2. form easy-on-the-eye + self-explanatory Combinations (Ligatures) of 2 or more letters, not only at the beginning, but also at the mid & end of words.
See (S+J) in Sojjadan and As-Sojood and (M+H+M) of Mohammed and explore more...
3. need no space between the words: one would simply understand where a word ends and the next one starts.
That's clearly seen in virtually all the Arabic Calligraphy (AC) of the "Qol Howa Allaho Ahad" where the Ha of the "Howa" overlaps the Lam of "Qol". Since the Lam takes the final shape and Ha the flower-like shape, then the space between the 2 words "Howa and Qol" is narrowed to minus.
—————— 03.2003 Start bulding my Naskh with 5+1 TTFs ——————
As the strength of a chain lies in its weakest link, the Quality of an Arabic font lies in its poorest feature: Ligatures , Diacritics Positioning Kerning?
By Applying my own technique, I finished designing -9 months ago- a new font of AC with the help of which I successfully completed building up the most Challenging Arabic Text of the Glorious Quran—3 years of hard work...
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MRALLAH_3859.JPG]
As the MRALLAH.jpg shows, my font is distinguished by:
• Ligatures of upto 4 Consonants, not only at the beginning, but also at the mid + end of words.
• Smart Joiners: Straight and curved Tails for Consonants and ligatures.
See (S+J) in Sojjadan and As-Sojood and how J joins D in the first and WAW in the latter.
• Full Kerning by shifting up and/or right any letter that follows, R,D,WAW and likewise. See (D+Alif) in Ashidda and (R+T) in Maghfiratan.
• Four (4) baselines for Consonants & 7 lines for Vowels (Diacritics).
See the 3 lines in (M+H+M) of Mohammed and the fourth in (Y+N) of Allazina.
• Accurate Vowels Positioning. They —Vowels (Diacritics or Marks) are:
1 horizontally centered, slightly above or below the letters they belong.
2 distributed in harmony with the ligatures,
3 neither touching the letters to which they belong, nor transgressing neighbors.
• WAW Discrimination: The word WAW (AND) is lowered and attached to the next word. See (WAW+R) in WaRizwana.
• Compatibility with any software that runs on 98/2000/XI & reads RTF.

That's right: In order to achieve all the possible ligatures of AC, and accurately position diacritics, I:
• Designed (5+1) TTFs comprising more than 1100 Glyphs and
• Translated the Rules of AC into Word-Macros to juggle 5 TTFs accordingly.
Finally, worth mentioning that Virtually, the Arabic Text (AT) of All the PC & TV Programs of the Glorious Quran
• is too small and/or does not match the poorest AC.
• does not always start and/or end meaningfully in the same screenshot,
• and/or does not always go in line with Recitation and/or Translation.
In summary: My Font solves all the Screen and Paper Publishing problems
————————— 08+09.2010 Aziz Naskh = A single TTF —————————
Aziz Unique+Dynamic Ballpen Naskh is being finalized to go with
<a href=http://typophile.com/node/48495>MaryamSoft Arabic Calligrapher</a>. I have typeset the above sample in Word 2003 and printed it to a PDFile (attached) in 2 colors, Glyphs in Black and the separable Dots + Marks in blue to emphasize the point mentioned by <a href=http://www.khaledhosny.org/node/142>khaledhosny</a>.

<div class=commentbody>Arabic is a glorious script (one of my all-time favorites),
and you've put in an incredible amount of effort. Bravo.
The main thing I notice about this is its extreme tightness.
This is not unique, but especially in the digital realm it
is pretty rare. It saves space, and creates a special texture,
but as you might have already encountered, some people
will say it's too tight.
Speaking of saving space, you write:
> need no space between the words
Although this is more true for Arabic than Latin (except for fully-joined Latin script fonts :-) it's still not true enough: if the last letter of a word happens to be one that has no join on its left, it can often get confusing. On the other hand, Arabic does save space in two other ways: it can dump [short] vowels*; and it distributes its "information" more evenly in the Cartesian area** (which also has a readability advantage). But this latter part comes at a price: lesser apparent size.
* Although this actually comes from a linguistic advantage:
Semitic languages need vowels far less than Indo-European ones.
** Whereas Latin for one is much more horizontal.
In terms of getting this to market, I might suggest Linotype.
But if they say no, they probably have a valid reason: they
already have an accomplished "uncompromising" Arabic
typeface, including full coverage of the Qur'aan style.
If they decline you could look for font houses that would
like to rival Linotype in Arabic fonts.
Or you could try contacting SIL. They recently
released Arabic fonts, but nothing like yours.
http://www.sil.org/ _
Just one thing: with SIL, don't push the Qur'aan angle too much.
Lastly, like Simon said you could do it all on your own.
But finding and leveraging good distribution channels
for this sort of thing is non-trivial.

<div class=commentbody>Misunderstood and Underestimated Space-savingness!
What makes Arabic space-saving is Not Only the Word-Spacings But Also Ligatures and Kerning (inter-word-spacing).
Ligatures integrate 2 or more letters into one. Example: L+M+H+M occupy a single Ha-space.
Kerning integrates 2 letters into One. Example: Alif+R occupy a single R-space.
Ligatures and Kerning are fantastically handled in my font.
Vowels too play their role in Arabic Space-savingness. How?
Arabic Vowels are virtually dropped without sacrificing readability thus made less horizontal than the Vowels-thirsty English.
Word Space Modulation (WSM)
If a word ending with a clockwise letter (like Ra) is followed by a word starting with counterclockwise letter (like 3ain), the space between them is eleminated without sacrificing readability. My word Macros fail to do this WSM in the case of a fully justified text.
What’s holding me back me from transforming my the Six (6) TTFonts into a single OTF?!
Unfortunately, LinoType rejected my font without giving any reason save-I guess- the complexity of transforming the 6 TTFs fonts into a single OpenType Font though they have never produced any “uncompromising” font with nor without the Quran style.
Lack of Capital, Lack of indepth Knowledge of Open-Type Tech and more discouraging is the Web that has rendered Copyrights meaningless particularly in the Arabic World. Here and around you can get All the Linotype and SIL fonts free of charge.
Otherwise, by now, I have marketed them without transforming them into a single font?</div>

Which is a shame, since deploying "vertical kerning" so to speak
seems like a pretty clever way to justify a line. On the other hand,
Arabic has the advantage of the wonderful kasheedah for doing the
same (although admitedly by taking up MORE space instead of less).

I thought Linotype sells the fancy Diwan font that handles
Qur'aan setting (the impressive demo of which I saw at the
ATypI conference in Leipzig in 2000).

The SIL fonts are actually free anyway (which doesn't
mean however that SIL doesn't pay people to make them).

I'm assuming that's not really a question,
and you're saying that you would have started
selling the "complex" system on your own were it
not for piracy. Ironically though, I would think
that this complexity would discourage piracy! :-)
But by the same token, it would discourage sales
as well I guess...
Maybe, if this is valuable enough to some people,
you could price it very high, include training with
the fonts, and settle for selling only a handful.

<div class=commentbody>Kasheedah is wonderful if deployed where needed. But It behaves randomly and indiscriminately beautifying some words and spoiling others. So, it is virtually useless. WSM is a wiser alternative. But...
Diwan Mishafi font is a built-in font and applicable in Diwan Sofwares only. Still it is not a faithful production (match) to their own Caligrapher's handwriting.
Complex system?!
Making the fonts and building the macros was as complex as building my <a href=http://www.crAUSwords.com/flowers/WFlowers.htm>Flowers</a>

However, I am Still fighting the web to find One of the handful you mentioned in your marketing proposal.

I can understand given the level of piracy out there that you might not want to go it alone, but Linotype isn't the only vendor working on Arabic types, Bitstream recently announced a tie-up with Mamoun Sakkal, and Monotype is involved in this area too. I'm sure there are others out there. For sure they may decide not to collaborate with you, but they'll likely give you an explanation if you ask nicely.

<div class=commentbody>this may be a little bit offtopic, but:
hrant said:
«Semitic languages need vowels far less than Indo-European ones.»
as far as i know, egyptian language (2000BC or so) used no vowels at all in written language - but i dont know how it was in spoken language.
that fact leads to the problem that some names could be pronounced differently - lets say "Ramses" could also be "Rumsos". but most of the names are probably covered because there are transcripts of them in other languages (à la stone of rosetta).
and yes, i know that semitic would mean "on the arabic peninsula" if you'd be precise, but i just wanted to add this fact, nothing more.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If your font is as good as you say it is, there should be enough of a market for it in the West (in fact, all around the world) to justify developing and publishing it yourself.
While going through that process might not at first be a good return on your investment of time, other things will grow out of it.
What you will need is your own website to publicize and explain the font, with a link to myfonts.com, where customers will be able to license and download it. That's the basic set-up for "indie" fonts, used by hundreds of foundries.
While Myfonts distributes all-comers, other distributors are selective, to varying degrees, in the number of foundries they represent. But those other distributors will be more inclined to distribute your font(s) once you have established a basic presence.
And really, there's not much difference between a contract with a distributor, and one with a publisher ("foundry").

Not really. Simply because high culture is not very marketable (like you should be realizing with Panoptica). Certainly, "good" doesn't equate to "trendy". In fact sometimes, Really Good stuff simply has to be given away. And other times it's sadly not a good fit to the devious and capricious retail market.

Aziz (or should I be addressing you as Mostafa?) -- I have type designs released by four publishers (since 1984), and another 20-odd typefaces which I publish myself (since 1999), which are sold around the world by nine distributors. So my advice is based on practical experience.
While it's true that a typeface such as my Panoptica sells only a small amount, and never gets on the best-seller list at Myfonts, since its release in 2003 it's sold over a hundred (individual fonts) there, to people from many countries. That's the thing, although the retail market is, if not devious, at least capricious, thanks to the Internet it is a world market, and there are enough people committed to good typography, around the world, to make self-publishing a viable business.

I certainly agree.
But it's mostly trendy faces that make the money. If you depended
only on fonts like Panoptica, would things still be "viable"? Sadly, no.
Anyway my main contention arose from your "enough of a market". Enough
for what? Probably a return on time invested. And in the case of something that
so few people (especially rich ones) appreciate, there's no way that's there.

Here's the variety for you: in Western Europe and the

> You’re mocking me for poor sales
?
No way. Poor sales (and 100 units isn't bad) on one font can be
just a fluke - most of the remainder of your library sells much
better, right? At least you've said before that your overall
sales are great - and that's enviable, not laughable.
Nick, we're different. If trying to help somebody else
understand something is a foreign concept to you, don't
think that everybody on the planet is like that. Yes, I
can, and do help people I don't like - if maybe mostly
because that helps ME become better. How many
times have I propped up Panoptica, Richler and
even Iowan Oldstyle? Blame my mother I guess.
> Right, popular faces sell more. Doh.
But the association you're skirting is that TRENDY,
as in fashionable, hip, faces (of which Aziz's font is
NOT one) are the popular ones.
The consolation is that these fonts
also tend to be forgotten quickly.
> obscure products can succeed
Financially, as a rule, obscure <cite>fonts</cite> cannot.
Make an Arabic font, even a trendy one, and let's see if
you make one month's rent or mortgage on it in 10 years.

Again, I'll pass on my experience -- Mostly in the US, but also this year I've sold fonts through Myfonts to people in Canada, Japan, Austria, Singapore, Australia, NZ, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, Finland, and Belgium. That's for fonts with Latin encoding. I leave it to Aziz to figure out where the Arab communities and Arab printers/publishers are.
<em>How many times have I propped up Panoptica, Richler and even Iowan Oldstyle?</em>

<em>Make an Arabic font, even a trendy one, and let’s see if you make one month’s rent or mortgage on it in 10 years.</em>
I don't know anything about Arabic fonts, or the market for them. But if there is any market at all (rather than relying on the reputation of Linotype), then the method I have outlined -- self-publishing and Internet sales -- may be one way to access it. I tend to *believe* in the unexpected, so why not try and make it happen?</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>Here’s the variety for you: in Western Europe and the US* people buy fonts, in the rest of the world they don’t. :-/</em>
Again, I'll pass on my experience -- Mostly in the US, but also this year I've sold fonts through Myfonts to people in Canada, Japan, Austria, Singapore, Australia, NZ, Switzerland, Puerto Rico, Finland, and Belgium. That's for fonts with Latin encoding. I leave it to Aziz to figure out where the Arab communities and Arab printers/publishers are.
<em>How many times have I propped up Panoptica, Richler and even Iowan Oldstyle?</em>
Is that like investing in insult credits?
<em>Make an Arabic font, even a trendy one, and let’s see if you make one month’s rent or mortgage on it in 10 years.</em>
I don't know anything about Arabic fonts, or the market for them. But if there is any market at all (rather than relying on the reputation of Linotype), then the method I have outlined -- self-publishing and Internet sales -- may be one way to access it. I tend to *believe* in the unexpected, so why not try and make it happen?</div>

All affluent countries. There's a reason Malaysia, Jordan
and Ecuador are absent, and it's not because they don't
use Latin fonts - they certainly do.
BTW, if you'd like an actual list, look at the middle of this page:
http://www.atypi.org/20_join_atypi/50_individual _
In fact why do you think ATypI makes such an exception?
Know that it didn't come easy - there was resistance at
the highest levels. But in the end it was so clearly just
that plain common sense prevailed.
See what proportion of fonts you sell to THAT collection of
countries (which coincidentally form the crushing majority
of this planet's population). I'm sorry, but no amount of
melifluous serenades about "the unexpected" is going to
change that reality.
> Is that like investing in insult credits?
Perhaps in a blindered, one-dimensional, one-upmanship world.
In my world, the compliments and "insults" (your term) come from
the same place: plain old honesty. If that fact seems... otherworldly,
then I'm sorry to see such an attitude.

Aziz Mustafa wrote:
>>Uncompromising Arabic Font
A better approach to Arabic fonts and Arabic typography is to ensure wide open options availability. We must ensure that users have options. Saying this I must congratulate Aziz on his great hard work. But “uncompromising Arabic fonts” is not the correct phrase. Perhaps "Uncompromising Calligraphic or traditional Quraanic Arabic font" would be better. Aziz fonts are uncompromising in their quality as related to a certain Arabic Quraanic calligraphic style but they not uncompromising fonts as Arabic fonts. Indeed they compromise technology and its economic factor, literacy, education, and global competition.
Traditional Arabic poetry is beautiful, but “free” Arabic poetry can be as beautiful. Both are Arabic poetry. Same goes for Arabic typography, we need to open options to the users. Arabic typography should not be defined rigidly.
>>As the strength of a chain lies in its weakest link, the Quality of an Arabic font lies in its poorest feature: Ligatures , Diacritics Positioning and Kerning?
Ligatures, are both strength and weakness. Strength calligraphically but weakness typographically. Technology almost passed Arabic by because of insistence on institutionalizing complexity as the norm. Arabic should not be hostage of technology, it should instead emphasize simplification to conquer technology. In fact Arabic history adapted to new factors.
>>need no space between the words: one would simply understand where a word ends and the next one starts.
Even the greatest quraanic and calligraphic Arabic test can significantly benefits from spaces. There is a need for space.

Dear hrant. I am confused. In another Forum and discussion, you attacked Mr. Thomas Milo, a pioneer Arabic caligraphic typfaces designer for decades dismissing even the need for Quraanic and calligraphic Arabic fonts. Why Aziz’s fonts are different now?

> dismissing even the need for Quraanic and calligraphic Arabic fonts.
1) Look through my previous posts in this thread, and try to find any place where I say that I actually like Aziz's font... A good critic helps a person get to where that person wants; he does not dismiss, he does not coerce; but he does educate and warn along the way. Taming one's own ideals is the key to becoming a good critic, for the simple reason that personal context is everything, and nobody is infallible or omniscient. Basically, it's an act of sharing, not shepherding.
2) The argument with Thomas was messy and emotional (especially when he lapsed into historical revisionism on occasion - as you yourself complained back then) but as far as I remember my point wasn't to dismiss anything, but to ask that people not engage in historicism for its own sake, ignoring the current sociopolitical needs of users, and also that whatever path they choose, they realize and admit its full effects. To me Thomas's "problem" is that his work in effect (if not really necessarily) engrains chirography to the depths of the bones of visible language, where I feel that even its presence in the outer skin is a problem! This, whether anybody realizes it, admits it, or not.
To his great credit however, if you remember, Thomas had the grace and humility to admit that perhaps chirography is not as good a foundation for his scheme as would be readability. I wish that other people -including myself- could be that way more often.

If Arabic is hostage of technology then *users” of Arabic technology become the same. I do not see your statement in disagreement of mine. To clarify mine further, when Arabic or any other script editing and production on computers requires costly and technically sophisticated technologies we risk loosing users, markets, global competitions, and a lot of unnecessary expenses. Complex Chinese jumped to the web before Arabic! Arab petro-dollars spent billions to ensure that letters like “Dal” must have an isolated, initial, medial, and more glyphs. Why?
> dismissing even the need for Quraanic and calligraphic Arabic fonts.
>>1) Look through my previous posts in this thread, and try to find any place where I say that I actually like Aziz’s font…
Dear Hrant, funny you mention that. Yes I did notice that you did not say that you like Aziz fonts. On the other hand I loved them. My Question was why did you attack Thomas work and passion for calligraphic and Quraanic typography but had nice words for Aziz’s similar work. This was my confusion. In that debate you even denied that Arab users need Thomas calligraphic fonts.
Aziz wrote:
>2. What is wrong with my font?
Absolutely nothing wrong. Despite my non calligraphic font designs, I love Arabic calligraphy and support strongly Thomas’s or your works. Arabic fonts must include both. Non should imply or hint that Arabic fonts must follow a set of rules, or they must follow calligraphic rules. Your “uncompromising Arabic fonts” title tells the reader that other non calligraphic fonts are “compromising Arabic fonts” which brought up my disagreement.
>Or should I dance to the tunes of the English-like Arabic Fonts Designers?!
Dance as you like and wish as long as you do not trip and do not push or hurt other dancers in the floor. Dance is healthy for us all
As for “English-like”, that is your opinion. Even if it is true I do not see why “English-like” or even “Chinese-like” is a problem here. Arabic is a great script that had adapted survived because of its great adaptability qualities. Remember font design is about options. Users options.

Well, I can think of a few reasons, one being that I was/am not being even-handed enough. But other reasons are: like I said, Thomas is engraining chirography much more deeply; and Aziz and Thomas have different contexts, and are asking for different things (or not asking for anything*); Aziz for example seemed confident (too confident?) in the integrity of his design, and was actually mainly asking for marketing advice. I guess I was trying to encourage a relative unkown simply by saying that the effort is appreciated; passion is the key, and it can drive future development, often in better directions; like how I used to make cruddy Armenian fonts (I mean really cruddy - not like Aziz's work at all) and people encouraged me, so I kept at it, and now make totally different, and I think much more mature, Armenian fonts.
* An "arty" attitude which is itself objectionable.
> In that debate you even denied that Arab users need Thomas calligraphic fonts.
I try to never be that absolute (I think even
Helvetica has its uses :-) so I don't think I
said such a thing. But if I did, I was wrong.

But also, do not dance alone, in a private expressive vacuum.
That's not Design; and it's very selfish.

Font design should be open. Users options should be open. What makes sense to some makes no sense to others. Technology and business are technology and Business. There are no "western technology" or "western Business". Just as Algebra and Chemistry are sciences not "Arabic Sciences" because they were historically developed by the Arab Muslim civilization.
>>I guess I was trying to encourage a relative unkown simply by saying that the effort is appreciated; passion is the key, and it can drive future development, often in better directions;
I have no doubt of your passionate and good natured manner, Hrant. That is why I was a bit surprised at your severity at that debate. Like you, my first comment to Aziz was "congratulations" too.

Your question depends on whether the software is legally free, or "free" because it is pirated.
For my business, there are enough people, here and there, around the world, who are not software pirates, who buy my fonts.
I have described what works for me, with Latin-script fonts, some of which are trendy, some of which are experimental, and some of which are straightforward.

More of the same. Speaking and generalizing on behalf of users and the entire universe! Defining Arabic font taste, rules, history and future based on personal preferences!

Your words has reminded me with my over-intelligent blood-brother when he looked at the Map of the Earth one day and said:
If God is All-Knowing, then why does the earth look like this?
>Again the right approach for Arabic typography in my judgment is to ensure the availability of options through hard work.
What options?

Interesting. I wasn't sure I agreed with that, but then

2 Swashed Ya — seen, sheen, sad, Zad as well as Qaf— if followed by words with no letter below the baseline (Lower Right couple of words)

1 Priority is given to swashing as it is more space-saving and more beautiful.

… I do know that Arabic script is not for Arabic use only, however, professor Aziz is addressing Arabs in his input and replies..
… And, there's also "another" site "discussing" type in Arabic http://www.hacen.net
Mr Aziz:
Are we here to discuss typography or democracy? Should we talk about Arabic dancing or Arabic typography?...
The site you mentioned to http://milafat.online.fr/arfonts/ is quite illegal, but what about the rest? …
If Arabs are all "dancers" rather "rulers" (not users) why do you waste your valuable time in developing "Arabic" type and fonts for such dancers? Why do you develop your fonts for the Holy Quraan to be used by those "dancers and rulers"?
What's your problem with Arabs? I had read many posts by you in forums blaming a nation which is famous in its passion of pen and calligraphy?..
.. Yeah, you'd better suck coffee when it comes to developing type industry in Arab world, but please be aware of sucking Arabic coffee.

<div class=commentbody>1. Profess that I am not a professor, but about to get PHD.
(PHD= Permanet Head damage).
2. Recommend mentioning <a href=http://www.hacen.net>Hacen</a> at <a href=http://typophile.com/user/13041>your page</a>.
3. Though ArabicTypsetting covers many of the scripts mentioned by John Hudson, it is still <a href="http://typophile.com/node/20638?from=0&comments_per_page=333">ArabicTypesetting</a>.
Persian Gulf not Arabic, and Arabic Script is not Persian?!
4. My love for Arabic + Arabs is immeasurable. Have been contributing to more than 20 sites. See the translation of this page into Arabic <a href="http://www.splart.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=11342">here</a>.
5. Dancers entertian Rulers and we are here to entertain Typophiles?!
6. Hope you do not mind discussing Democracy in Type not Type in Democracy?!
7. Do you know that the Iraqi Calligrapher was forced into writing the
Glorious Quran in <a href="http://www.splart.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=16611"> Saddam's blood</a>. Against the ABC teachings of Islam?!
8. You are welcome to post off-topic here, but I am shaking the Cupful?!

<div class=commentbody>1- Profess that i dont mean acadimic degrees when i say "professor", it's the same tactful word as all Arabs (Dancers) say.
2- No bandwidth usage please.
3- We look at the Gulf saying "Arabian Gulf" from our side, they say "Persian Gulf" but the script is still right-to-left.
4- I know very well your contributions in those 20 sites sir.
5- Rulers became already dancers, dont you know?
6- If there's democracy in type, i vote for you as the Arabic type president (no ruler).
7- Saddam's blood is not the case now. Iraqis' bloods.
8- Mixing typography with dancing might be off-topic.. did i ..?

<div class=commentbody>Mr Aziz:
The "billion dollars" aftermath is not the case for now, we -as amateurs, not so many- aim at providing quality Arabic typefaces for low cost -rather free. We appreciate the appearance of "Tasmeem" from WinSoft, but take into consideration that this twelve-thousands dollar-cost software has nothing new to deliver to Arabic typography, dont turn around -you, the pros- with your "OpenType" type settings, there's much more coming:
SAY GOODBYE TO THOSE "ALLEGED" IMPROVEMENTS FOR "ARABIC" (DANCE). Now we are working to deliver REAL typographic system not OTF nor TTF it's proudly HSF (Hacen Smart Fonts) which will stop this turning around and fooling "Arabic" users (dancers)..
SEE IT SOON. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>In looking up information about the Nastaliq style of Arabic script, I found the statement that it originated as a simplification of the previous Naksh style. And so the common Naksh fonts that work with only four forms of each letter indeed do not do it justice. Even the font shown here, with its ligatures, apparently is not doing everything that the Naksh writing style normally includes: in proper written Naksh, while the writing baseline is horizontal, and not diagonal as in Nastaliq, it can still vary in steps because not all letters will always join at the base.
As for Semitic languages and vowels - the story is complex. Basically, because the root of the word consists of consonants, while vowels alter the word grammatically, like suffixes in English, writing vowels as full letters instead of as an annotation is distracting. This is also true of ancient Egyptian, which is believed to be related to the Hamitic languages and perhaps the Semitic ones, but this classification is not certain. So vowels may be a bit less important, but also that their importance, as it may be, is of a different kind. (Of course, spoken Egyptian had vowels, or it could not have been spoken.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Of course, I'm no expert on Arabic typography, given I can't even spell Naskh properly, but the issue I'm thinking of - "assimilation" rules - is covered in Thomas Milo's tutorial on Arabic typography, which is where I had seen it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Many thanks, John; this will be very useful. I came across a different set of documents when I tried to search for it myself. The document you reference is exactly what I need.
Upon a quick read, I was surprised to find out how differently Thomas Milo has interpreted the very basic issue of the structure of the Arabic alphabet. I will try to read it more thoroughly, and might come back with a posting.

<div class=commentbody>Incidentally, on [[http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents18-1.html|this page]], there is a link to an article about the complexities of even the simpler approach of typesetting Arabic in metal type without the refinements I've mentioned.
Direct PDF link: [[http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb18-1/tb54arab.pdf]]
The same article, but with different formatting, is available from [[http://omega.enstb.org/yannis/|this page]] as item #40 in the numbered list of publications on that page.
Direct PDF link: [[http://omega.enstb.org/yannis/pdf/ep96-arabic.pdf]]
Also, I'm sure that if Thomas Milo has made mistakes in his understanding of how Arabic is traditionally written, he will be most interested to hear of it. I think I accidentally came across his paper when searching for information related to Nastaliq. As there is an open-source Nastaliq font that just happens to be usable only in an obsolete Mac environment, taking its glyphs and making a new open-source Nastaliq font would seem to be a useful service that some Linux enthusiast might perform. The glyphs are there in the package separate from the font in its Mac-specific form; I am going to have to see if it's one that Fontforge is capable of reading.</div>
