body: "Hello Typophile, I've been looking for a problem for my Helvetica-attempts
  in integrating the font over the impostor, Arial.\r\n\r\nI've been having some strange
  results; Helvetica looks fine in some cases, but in other cases, looks awkward.
  I mean this by strange pixel densities, character spacing, and just plain awkward-looking
  characters (r's too short, e's look awkward, etc).\r\n\r\nHere's a sample picture
  of what I'm talking about:\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v150/aznhomig/Strange.png\r\n\r\nAs
  the picture details, there are some sections (including the typed text I added myself
  in Helvetica, of course :)) that look fine, but other parts that don't. I mean this
  in often short characters, especially in \"x\"'s, \"e\"'s, and \"r\"'s and numbers
  that just doesn't match up.\r\n\r\nI've heard that Windows XP just has bad font
  rendering when it comes to PostScript or OpenType, so I'm looking for any information
  regarding what I need to do to fix this. Perhaps I need to get myself a Helvetica
  font file in a different format? (Right now it's in TrueType, but I also have OpenType
  versions that also look awkward when I use them).\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!
  :D"

    make the characters you want to be the same ht. in bitmaps ,exactly the same ht.
    in the outlines.\r\n2. you can turn off all hinting when you generate your existing
    font, and take another look.\r\n3. you can manually hint the existing font as
    it stands. Windows still respects y hints and this will fix it. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Yes, it's hinting. If you want to avoid manual hinting of your existing files,
    get Helvetica Com OpenType font from Linotype which is optimized for best screen
    quality (an XSF, excellent screen font). Then switch to ClearType, instead of
    standard smoothing, in Windows XP.\r\n\r\nwww.linotype.com/12753/neuehelvetica55roman-font.html?#format"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, fellas. :)\r\n\r\n@ dberlow: How would I go about
    turning off hinting on Windows XP or while I \"generate\" the font? How would
    I also go about manually hinting my existing Helvetica .ttfs as well?\r\n\r\n@
    loremipsum: Would your post mean I would have to buy Helvetica again? All of this
    is all very expensive, and perhaps you can tell me how to convert my current files
    in a manner that would not look strange on my screen? I have had ClearType on
    constantly, and turning it off doesn't do any good either."

    preferences in the font generation window and select, don't hint, whatever that
    is called...I'm not looking right now. You can also edit the \"gasp\" table which
    can tell MS apps what to do, including ignoring the hints, also in Fontlab, I
    think.\r\n\r\n\"How would I also go about manually hinting my existing Helvetica
    .ttfs as well?\"\r\nLearn the TT instruction language MS.com/typography, get Visual
    TrueType MS.com/typography, learn how to use it, and then hint the y direction
    of your font.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how serious you are, but my general experience
    is that users seeking better screen output are more likely to deal succesfully
    by selecting another font. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
