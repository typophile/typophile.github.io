    home page doesn't seem to fit the purpose of the website."

  body: The typography seems more oriented towards looking cool than being readable
    in some cases (on the front page particularly) but it's consistent and clean.
    The site seems organized and thought-out, and the Helvetica is fine for me stylistically.
    Not particularly unique, but I see the aesthetic they're going for.

  body: "The Current title reminds me of a famous poster of dutch designer Wim Crouwel,
    back from 1966. Can't find a good online picture, but in the upper right corner
    of <a href=\"http://webpages.marshall.edu/~bruggemann1/national_visions_within_a_global2.htm\">this
    page</a> you see a small version.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nMy
    work is a game. A very serious game [M.C. Escher]"
