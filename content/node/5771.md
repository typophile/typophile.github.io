body: 'I work for a medium-sized in-house design department for a giant technology
  company. A woman came to me to ask me to make placecards &#40;fun!&#41; for a company
  dinner party with the names of guests on them, so people would know where to sit.
  These cards were to be slightly bigger than a business card, and would probably
  be viewed from a distance of 10 - 20 feet, by tipsy guests milling around holding
  glasses, yakking, etc. The client&#39;s one specific request: she wanted a photoshop
  montage on it.  <BR> <BR>On a place card. <BR> <BR>It was at that moment that I
  knew something is being put in our public water supply to make people crave these
  cliched, dated eyesores -- I&#39;m not sure what else would explain it. Virtually
  every day I interact with a client who has almost no design awareness whatsoever,
  no preferences of colors, typefaces, illustration styles... EXCEPT they know they
  want a photoshop montage. &#40;Not that they call it that.&#41; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
  gotten so extreme that many clients will balk at any clean, hard-edged shape whatsoever.
  Every line of type must have a blurred drop shadow, a beveled edge and an outer
  glow -- every box or circle must have hazy edges that fade into whatever is behind
  it. Every paragraph must have a big photograph &#34;ghosted&#34; behind it &#40;good
  luck reading that, sister!&#41; <BR> <BR>In my daily life I see them everywhere
  now: muddy magazine ads, murky point-of-purchase displays -- institutional brochures
  are so likely to have photoshop collages that it&#39;s almost like the default style.
  The worst of the lot is so busy and confusing that you can&#39;t make out any actual
  images: &#34;what&#39;s going on in there?&#34; My coworker calls it &#34;Photoshop
  Stew.&#34; <BR> <BR>Near my house is a Blockbuster Video store that contains a 10-foot
  high point-of-purchase display created to get people to buy Direct TV, or something
  like that. This thing is the size of large refrigerator, and every surface is covered
  with a grayish-blue photoshop montage of... stuff you would see on tv, I guess.
  Looking at it is like sifting through the wreckage of a plane crash. &#34;Is that
  a football player&#39;s arm? Is this part of a car? Is that a chicken? <BR> <BR>Do
  people like them because they look &#34;complex?&#34; Because it&#39;s something
  they couldn&#39;t do themselves in Microsoft Word? The clients I&#39;m referring
  to are all middle-aged and pretty conservative, so it&#39;s not like they&#39;re
  pining for the &#34;grunge&#34; look of the early nineties. <BR> <BR>In Paula Scher&#39;s
  new book, &#34;Make It Bigger,&#34; she speculates that the reasons clients love
  these abominations is because they&#39;re vague and non-committal -- ironically
  the same reasons I hate them. But the montages have the function of reducing responsibility
  / potential culpability of the client. How can your boss or coworkers criticize
  the content / subject matter of an image if you can&#39;t tell what it is? <BR>
  <BR>The strange thing is that before coming to this job I experienced very little
  of this madness. Are other people experiencing things like this? Any suggestions
  about how to handle it -- counseling, heavy drinking, another career? <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for reading my long rant. I&#39;m off to make hard-edged vector art in Illustrator.
  &#40;Mmmm, clean, so clean.&#41;  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    at a major video rental chain here in British Columbia.  The cover is a murky,
    muddy, eye-tearing montage of blurry screenshots from movies of 2002. <BR> <BR>It
    seems like it&#39;s a of disease, some kind of Photoshopfilteritis mutation, influenced
    by some of the genuinely interesting work that some of the European digital designers
    are doing.  It began in the US and is spreading from there. <BR> <BR>Be honest
    with your client.  Tell them how inappropriate and butt-ugly a montage will be.  Show
    them how successful design doesn&#39;t stoop to vague photomontages without a
    good reason. <BR> <BR>The philosophy of the best designers is &#34;to help the
    client, not to please the client.&#34; Of course, I only wish I could afford to
    uphold this ideal. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Do the montage and do a version of the placecard as you see it. Raise concerns
    about readability and wait for feedback. <BR> <BR>Who does just ONE comp to show
    a client? <BR> <BR>The only way to educate the client and build their level of
    taste is to design beyond their expectations and present at least two designs
    you&#39;d be happy to have produced. <BR> <BR>The one good one, one bad one thing
    ALWAYS backfires. <BR> <BR>You must always remember that you are being hired by
    a person to do something that isn&#39;t within their skillset to do. You are an
    agent for them acting on their behalf. <BR> <BR>That doesn&#39;t mean you have
    to lay down and eat sh!t with your design work for them and it also doesn&#39;t
    mean you should totally ignore them. It means you are as much an advisor as you
    are the guy to help them realize their vision as you interperate it. <BR> <BR>Relax

  body: I feel your pain. <BR> <BR>Arguing against this kind of thing to clients,
    I often use a typographic analogy, explaining that the way you &#39;read&#39;
    a picture is similar to how you read a page of text - graphics and text require
    similar planning. You need to have some kind of strong image, or portion of the
    image, to function like a headline; it needs to stand out and draw the reader&#39;s
    attention, at which point they&#39;ll decide if they want to look deeper into
    the layout or not, just as a good headline is what makes a reader decide to read
    a newspaper story or not. Then you can use smaller images, or subsidiary images,
    to convey more detailed information. Even if the images are all parts of a collage,
    there needs to be organization and a heirarchy of some kind. If you were designing
    an ad using only type, you wouldn&#39;t print a column of solid text with no headings
    at all, but you could potentially use punchy headline on its own. In the same
    way, a single, strong image is much more powerful than a bunch of jumpled images
    fighting each other for attention, which is like a page of body text with no headline.
    You need to have contrast. Also, just like text, the graphics need to have a function;
    you wouldn&#39;t put a bunch of words on the page that didn&#39;t say anything,
    just because they looked &#39;cool.&#39; You&#39;d only put words on the page
    that communicated a message. Each element needs to have a job to do or it shouldn&#39;t
    be there. <BR> <BR>I also try to convince them, again using a typographic analogy,
    to give consideration to the amount of the reader&#39;s attention they can expect.
    You could easily fit many paragraphs of small text onto a trade show display,
    but very few people would actually read it, since the show floor is full of other
    graphics screaming for attention; if your display demands more that a couple of
    seconds to digest, the potential customer will simply walk on to the next thing.
    However, a museum placard next to a painting could have a couple of paragraphs
    of small text, because you have an interested reader who will give it their full
    attention. <BR> <BR>The average person will not give a table place card much undivided
    attention; as long as the name is clearly legible and it looks neat and attractive,
    it&#39;s doing its job. Anything clutter or reduced contrast between text and
    a background image would reduce its functionality; you definitly don&#39;t want
    people wandering around peering at them to find their place at the table. The
    guests are not going to be impressed by the graphics, they&#39;re going to be
    annoyed. What a bizzare place for a photo collage! <BR> <BR>This is off the subject
    a bit, but when dealing with middle-aged clients, I often mention the old black-and-white
    Volkswagon ads, and point out that what made them so memorable is their straightforwardness
    and simplicity. The photos were completely unpretentious - usually a silhouetted
    image of a car or part of a car. No color, one photo, a short headline and a few
    sentences of body copy, all floating on a plain, white background, yet decades
    later most people remember this campaign vividly. It was the cleverness, humor,
    and the work that went into actual ideas that paid off. If those ads had been
    cluttered with several pictures and a column of text, filled every square inch
    of the page, and if each ad tried to make ten different points, nobody would remember
    them today. A single idea, conveyed with directness and restraint, can hit harder
    than a whole bunch of little messages. <BR> <BR>One reason we see so much bad
    art, I believe, is because of the way many large companies are structured. Large
    institutions tend to generate fear of authority. The biggest problem with a client
    in a large organization &#40;whether or not you, yourself are also part of that
    organization&#41; is that your client is usually not the person who originated
    the project. Your client &#40;the person you deal with&#41; may not really understand
    the underlying purpose, since the project may have passed through many hands before
    it gets to you - middle managers, assistants, account reps, art directors, etc.
    <BR> <BR>What&#39;s sad is that often I feel that the originator might be open
    to new ideas if they only saw them. The originating Big-Shot may have mentioned
    doing a collage as a casual suggestion, expecting to see other concepts. However,
    the underlings will show the Big Shot nothing but collages, because that&#39;s
    what the Big Shot specifically mentioned. Maybe someone in the middle has the
    mistaken idea that the Big Shot likes collages &#40;because they used one last
    year&#41;, or maybe somebody in the middle simply likes collages themselves, changed
    the specifications, and will pass through nothing but collages. I&#39;m sure that
    almost every graphic designer/illustrator/typesetter/photographer/copywriter has
    had an experience where they were given detailed instructions and it later turned
    out that the originator of the project wanted the exact opposite. There are also
    basic human tendencies for each person to hold back some information, telling
    the next person only what they &#39;need to know,&#39; or to do the opposite and
    change or embellish the specifications. Thus, the instructions for the project
    get warped and degraded as it passes through several people with different levels
    of taste, imagination and competence. You may come up with brilliant concepts
    that serve the purpose of the project perfectly, but they may never get seen by
    the originator, and you may never know which ideas the originator rejected and
    which ones simply got edited out by the middlemen. <BR> <BR>I often find that
    projects for smaller companies are the most fun, because there is less organizational
    structure, and often you have at least some direct communication with the originator.
    <BR> <BR>This isn&#39;t really a rant, I&#39;m just musing on something that most
    people in the graphic arts constantly deal with. I always like to understand the
    underlying reasons for a project, not just a set of specifications; this tells
    me what is important and what might be flexible. For instance, do they want use
    or not use particular colors because somebody arbitrarily likes or doesn&#39;t
    like that color, simply because they did/didn&#39;t use that color in other recent
    projects, or because there are specific, real reasons &#40;white is the color
    of death in parts of Asia; a certain color scheme is associated with a competitor&#41;.
    Often this kind of information is not provided without passing detailed questions
    up and down the line. What can be frustrating is that these questions don&#39;t
    always go all the way to the top, and what you get back may be wrong. Often, large
    organizations have no idea why things are done in certain ways, but everyone is
    afraid to change or question. <BR> <BR>Take care, <BR> <BR>- Paul

  body: I had the challenge several years ago to do a montage for a childrens flash
    educational thing and honestly really enjoyed it. <BR> <BR>It was not used as
    the main image but more of an accent to the kids control panel interface &#40;less
    than 15% of the space used&#41;. It was perhaps the first and only time I really
    enjoyed the challenge of a montage and while I fought it, found that it was purposeful
    in the design to reflect a broad idea to instantly theme a section of the design
    instead of just for the sake of having a montage or becuase a client requested
    it. <BR> <BR>Even though as a designer I am compelled to do the best work I can,
    I am willing to try any style of design once. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to throw down
    the gauntlet and offer an open challenge to typophile posters to re-create an
    authentic utilitarian chinese fast food menu. <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~smailesy/images/chinese_menu.jpg"
    target="_blank">http://www.btinternet.com/~smailesy/images/chinese_menu.jpg</a>
    <BR> <BR>The thing that is most exciting about the design of a Chinese menu is
    that it is chock full of montage, a host of fonts, often asymmetrical, designed
    with little foundation of proper design, and utilizes a host of color shemes not
    meant to work together as we&#39;ve been taught. <BR> <BR>I think through the
    exercise of recreating such a design abomination complete with poor leading would
    enlighten and humble any designer to understand that even if you hate some of
    the trends in design you may see, until you make one of them for yourself, you
    won&#39;t understand why or how they work. <BR> <BR>I think any good designer
    must extend their range to include designs and design elements they totally disagree
    with in order to grow as a professional. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: I think the problem lies with amateurs equating <b>detail</b> with <i>quality</i>
    &#40;montages=visual detail&#41;. The connection does not always exist as we all
    know but it takes training to realise this. This is a universal problem and its
    not going to go away. You can talk about educating clients and that may work in
    some cases, but with <i>marketing</i> increasingly taking over our world, this
    is not going to be effective in the long run. Design requires a lot of background
    thinking, but as the product is often visual/supeficial this is not appreciated.  <BR>
    <BR>I dont know what the answer is but the problem is getting worse as the marketing
    industry grows, thats for sure.
