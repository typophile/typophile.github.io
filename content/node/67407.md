body: "I'm looking for some simple yet effective font software to make my design (Adobe
  Illustrator) into a real font. About 20 years ago I worked with Fontographer which
  was quite pleasing, but I suspect it's changed over the years (BTW, I've changed
  too; from Mac to PC (yes, I know...)). And perhaps there is by now much better software?\r\n\r\nTips
  anyone?"
