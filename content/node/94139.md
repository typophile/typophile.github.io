  Maybe there is a combination of written and font.\r\n\r\nhttp://goodeveningeurope.com/fonts/1959title.png\r\n\r\nI
  suspect the jpg might be a bit clearer to look at: http://goodeveningeurope.com/fonts/1959title.jpg
  \r\n\r\nThese examples are from the year 1959, a show in France. I am not sure if
  that helps.\r\n\r\nThanks very much in advance for your help. If you need some more
  samples of this font do let me know.\r\n\r\nIs the font available online? Can I
  read about it and its designer anywhere?"

  body: Most definitely hand-lettered, but the serif font appears to be based on Garamond
    (the pre-digitized versions).

  body: Which one is the serif? Was Garamond around in 1959? Thanks for your help.
