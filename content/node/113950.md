body: Can someone PLEASE help me identify these fonts?! One of them looks like joined-together
  cursive bubble letters (Justice),and the other one, (Elizabeth) looks like some
  type of cursive lettering. Any help will be greatly appreciated!! Even if the fonts
  are custom one-of-a-kind lettering, can you name fonts that are similar to these
  two in which they look the most like? Thanks in advanced!
