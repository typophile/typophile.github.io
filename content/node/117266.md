  Westerdals Graphic Design was to make an inspiring and teaching magazine about graphic
  design. The target group was future students on Westerdals graphic Design.\r\n \r\nThe
  survival guide portrays the first year of Westerdals Graphic Design as a year of
  hell. If you aren\u2019t following the guide, then you wont be able to survive the
  first year.  The magazine is based on a step-by-step guide with assets like dictionary
  and notes. With a focus on blending military influenced typography and Swiss black
  and white illustrations. It tries to create the feeling of survival, just like the
  old military guides in the US. Army. The format is a pocket size so the students
  will able to carry it all the time when survival will be needed.\r\n \r\n- 140mm
  x 250mm\r\n- 200g Paper - Cover\r\n- 95g  Paper - Inside\r\n- PVA Glued\r\n\r\n\r\n[[https://www.behance.net/gallery/17637305/Survival-Magazine-for-graphic-designer]]"
