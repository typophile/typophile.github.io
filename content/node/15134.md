    it here 'http://www.musicaecomputer.com/fonts/brochure/italiano.htm'\r\nbut if
    you're interested in the original name (they may have renamed it) you'd have to
    ask again, and someone else might know (by original name, I mean what it was called
    when it first came out from the foundry and before Corel renamed it, if they did,
    that is, though I'm not sure about that)"
