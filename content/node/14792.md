  doing for a friend's letterpress stationery business. Before I do more final touch-ups
  and de-bugging, I thought I'd throw it into the typophile net, and see what you
  all have to say. It's all just hand-coded HTML & CSS. No fancy flashy. Let me know
  what you think!\r\n\r\nThanks-\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oldschoolstationers.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've never been particularly fond of the horizontal layout approach, but that's
    just me. You might consider dressing up the scroll area and scrollbar for the
    Anthropologie store locations -- it's kind of bland.

  body: I like it in general - l there is a kind of unfocused quaklity about it which
    reminds me of the cards themsellves - but I think Doing something a little different
    with the top where you have the title & the flowers interacting is whaere I would
    start if I was tweaking. It's also true that the fuctional bit is quite hidden
    - can you think of a way of suggesting users scroll right? Also a bit longer(
    wider) would be good. I'd like to see more contanet even if it's just your pet
    cat yawning...

  body: "I would work on your information heirarchy and get that happening. I found
    it hard to work out what was going on. It might be worth considering a layout
    more like an old style newspaper, using more old school fonts. I would avoid using
    Helvetica/arial, I don't think it quite suits the material.\r\nThe headings need
    to stand out more - perhaps darken them, and use a similar font tho that used
    on hte heading. It may or may not be ledgible if it's too small though.\r\nThe
    information in the scroll bar might be better suited to a drop dpwn menu. That
    way, the heirarchy of information can be presented in a clearer way.\r\nThe diagram
    of the card making process is a very strong element that perhaps deserves its
    own page.\r\nI would consider breaking the information on this page down into
    sub pages. Although it's nice to have everything presented here, it means that
    all the items are competing with one another. To that end, consider having the
    headings you have, but reduce the text under them to a minmum and have a \"more\"
    link to a new page that has all the details.\r\nConsolidate your fonts and paragrpah
    styles and keep them consistent. Increase contrast. Make tighter boxes of information
    with more space around them.\r\nI'll try to dig out some examples of what I mean
    when I get home.\r\nHope that helps."

    near indispensible for creatives and this is one reason why.\r\n\r\nb) Thank you
    for taking the time to respond. I'd love to hear feedback from more of you- thus
    I've gotten so far has been a big help in thinking about it in different ways."

  body: "I agree with ubergrafik about breaking it out over a few pages. Treat each
    area as a singular creation with great focus and care in the details. Kind of
    like the stationary. I also agree with Eben about the header, it needs focus.
    It looks jumbled and less refined next to the subheaders (such as 'News + Updates',
    etc.).\r\n\r\nGet rid of that Helvetica and replace it with the type used for
    the states, or something more appropriate.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of horizontal
    scrolling, but it's not a deadlly choice or anything. Humans may have a horizontal
    \"experience\" but my mouse has a vertical one. But, again, it's really a matter
    of small degrees of annoyance.\r\n\r\nI also find the tight cropping on the pattern
    examples annoying. They're great, let me see more!\r\n\r\nMake that copyright
    mark smaller. It ruins the feel of the site by sitting there like a Coke can in
    historical Williamsburg. \r\n\r\nOverall, good stuff. It needs refining, but you've
    got a lot of intriguing material and a good start."

  body: "'too busy' perhaps?\r\n\r\njust kidding - i put a ton of of typos on Typophile\r\n\r\n
    ;-)\r\n\r\nI think that to some extent the business site should be a reflection
    of the cards themselves. Have you looked them? Modern reductivism may not be the
    aesthetic to employ here. Admittedly it could be much tougher to create something
    with coherence when you are working with busy patterns - but that might be the
    appropriate thing to do give the subject of the site."

  body: "I like the horizontal format, it lays out the basic information in an attractive,
    clear way and rather than having separate pages and open tabs or windows to refer
    to, allows the reader to scroll across, although I think you could standardise
    your heading style (type size) and have a separate column for each section (the
    columns need not be of equal measure but should have equal gutters). I have questions
    about the title, why is the rabbit there? Is it blowing a musical instrument or
    holding a rake? Why is it falling off the O? I think that the stationers part
    of the title should be the same size as Old School or on a new line with an uppercase
    S and the whole title should fit the measure of either 1 or 2 columns.\r\nTim"

  body: "Generally, I agree with previous comments that it's too busy, and there's
    a lack of hierarchy - or reading sequence.\r\n\r\nThe ANTHROPOLOGIE section is
    impossible to read/scan.\r\nIts viewport is too short, resulting in scrolling
    becoming too 'fast'. Context disappears as you read.\r\n\r\nOn this monitor, I
    get both vertical and horizontal scrollbars. That's a problem I think if you want
    to really bring home the horizontal concept(and it needs to be brought home since
    it is not 'standard praxis'). Make sure the site's height at least fits on a 768px
    screen (somewhere around 520-560px I'd guess).\r\n\r\n"

  body: The new design is nice & subtle but lacks some of the visual intrest of the
    cards. It would make a nice really blog though! My main question is - how can
    I tell this site is about cards in the 1st 2-3 seconds? Making that clear seems
    important. There will no doubt be lots of kinds of visitors and this design could
    serve many of them but one important kind would be a person who is thinking of
    ordering cards for their business & wants to know what they look like. That kind
    of person would -maybe- not be served by this design. It also seems like the title
    at the top might punch harder... Just a little.

    here it is the first thing I see."
