body: Hello everybody. I have a question for you. <BR>I&#39;m using Office XP and
  Adobe Acrobat to create my pdf&#39;s. They are mostly text documents, created for
  online reading. I would like to know, for reasons of legibility, what fonts I should
  use. So far I like Adabi MT and Gill Sans as sans serif fonts. As for the serifs
  I saw a pdf that used Bembo &#40;I don&#39;t know much about this font&#41; that
  I liked. In fact I hardly found any serif font which looks nice in the pdf at small
  sizes &#40;10-14 points&#41;. <BR>I think you can help me. Thank you in advance.
