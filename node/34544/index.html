  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve come across an interesting typographical dillema in the face I&rsquo;m creating - which happens to be a &lsquo;pixel-font&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The typical thing to do, would be to size the Q and O characters proportionally the same in the grid, simply adding any variation of the cross-bar below to make the Q. The thing that I&rsquo;m finding, however, is that if I extend the Q character one additional pixel, the cross-bar [at the corner] appears &lsquo;aesthetically correct&rsquo;, even though the two characters are now proportionally distinct.</p>
<p>I guess then, I&rsquo;m wondering if anyone can offer their feedback - opinions toward to what extent should we feel it necessary to break certain rules in favor of the aesthetic? Or, would making such changes be a severe no-no in your opinions?</p>
<p>And - in referencing some typefaces that are centuries old - it appears that a distinct Q was often used that was non-proportional to the O character. Thus, is there really a &lsquo;rule&rsquo; afterall, if one can reference typography of the past?</p>
<p>(Perhaps I&rsquo;m over-thinking this issue?)</p>

<p>One of the environmental procedures I&rsquo;ve been incorporating in the testing phases of these typefaces - is to use them in a Win 98 theme. (Yes, I&rsquo;m Windoze.) That&rsquo;s really where I noticed the extent that it works in this particular face - though, it disturbed me no end!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Apologies for the secrecy, though it appears to be a necessity at this time. Unfortunately, I located someone beginning to &lsquo;rip&rsquo; where I was going with the typefaces - whom was located through my analytics on my site. I don&rsquo;t care to point fingers at people - I just take down the demonstrations as a result of anothers' apparent unoriginality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that some people do that. Then again, I should probably have learned by now that this is the type of thing that can happen as a result of being open and demonstrating progress. It kind of saps the fun out of it, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>I once expressed my fears of posting my own font projects here to one of Typophile&rsquo;s founders, and he (I believe it was Jared, but maybe it was both Joe AND Jared) said to me, &ldquo;If you have something posted on Typophile, with a time and date, it would be proof that it was your idea if someone came along later and tried to rip you off.&rdquo; Just a thought to encourage you.  :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you, Ricardo. The original production versions were posted in a Flash file, with logged dates in the process. I&rsquo;m not particularly concerned with that aspect of it. What I am concerned with, is potentially having gone a particular &lsquo;original&rsquo; route that can easily become modified by others. At this time, I don&rsquo;t see it being necessary to post an example as it was primarily a research study question.</p>
<p>To update on that research progress, however, I spent the last few days digging centuries back in the etymology of the &lsquo;O&rsquo; glyph form. As it turns out, the &lsquo;O&rsquo; is a very modern representation that&rsquo;s only more modernly depicted with the &lsquo;Q&rsquo; character&rsquo;s geometry. In proper English and in the Western / North-American and in various Latin cultures, for instance &ndash; the modern &lsquo;O&rsquo; (or &lsquo;o&rsquo;) can be considered somewhat of a &lsquo;bastardization&rsquo; of pronounciations &ndash; thus, making it a highly subjective glyph.</p>
<p>Though, I do understand the need for &lsquo;balancing&rsquo; the &lsquo;O&rsquo; with the &lsquo;Q&rsquo; for most aesthetic reasons &ndash; I&rsquo;ve come away with this subtle bit of historical information that has enlightened me to a certain extent as to how I wish to proceed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post examples eventually, of course. Don&rsquo;t mean to be a poopy-head about it. Just that it turned into something rather &lsquo;important&rsquo; for me at this time.</p>
