    one of Adobe's resellers, ie <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0005368\">Veer</a>.\r\n\r\nsee

  body: The greek part is inside the OpenType fonts. If you buy Adobe's Garamond Premiere
    Pro from Linotype, the Greek character sets are inside those fonts, just as if
    you would license the fonts from anywhere else!
