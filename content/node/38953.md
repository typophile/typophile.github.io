  The files I've been given for the two newspaper names (a merger) are fuzzy eps files.
  I'd like to find the fonts for these (though it's possible that one of them was
  hand lettered, I really doubt it) so that I can recreate them. These are old newspapers
  from before the dawn of digital typography...I'm anxious to find out if these fonts
  are available digitally. On behalf of Charley, the editor, and the rest of Crawford
  County (proudly the poorest county in Wisconsin!), I thank you for your help and
  expertise!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_ccIND_4189.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_KS_5089.jpg]"

  body: "Mr. Koppa,\r\n\r\nI knew right away from the Kickapoo Scout that you had
    to be from Wisconsin! I canoed that river when I was 13. I've also spent some
    time in La Farge, WI. Which, if my memory serves me correctly, isn't too far from
    Viroqua.\r\n\r\nWelcome aboard! It's great to have a fellow Wisconsinite around.\r\n\r\nGo
    Pack!\r\n\r\nMark"

    if any Typophile out there can deny that [[http://www.packers.com|the Packers]]
    have the best looking helmets in the NFL.\r\n\r\nYes, La Farge is on the Kickapoo,
    16 miles East of Viroqua, and that's where I'm sitting right now. The Crawford
    County Independent serves Gays Mills (25 miles South of Viroqua)...you all may
    have heard about the flood this past August. But we're a resillient lot, us Kickapoojians.
    Poor, resillient, and happy.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help with the Holly Script,
    all. What about the Scout? This is so exciting I can hardly stand it."
