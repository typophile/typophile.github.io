  ligatures in a number of my fonts. Here's the class definition:\r\n\r\n<code>%%CLASS
  _i_right\r\n%%GLYPHS  i' fi ffi dotlessi iacute icircumflex idieresis igrave imacron
  iogonek itilde dottediacute \r\n%%KERNING R 0\r\n%%END</code>\r\n\r\nThe fi and
  ffi glyphs are so named in the fonts, and swap out just fine. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Soooo...nobody else has encountered this problem? Bummer. I really had hoped
    to solve this problem before another pass through 900+ fonts to update them...

  body: FontLab's "right class" means that a class represents the right (second) partner
    of a kern pair. That means you should make this a left class. As it is now, fi
    will follow the kerning of i when it appears on the right hand side of a kern
    pair.
