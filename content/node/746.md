    have time to hunt down the rest. If someone wants them, e-mail and I&#39;ll give
    them to you. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    just finished a meeting early at a client&#39;s and been killing a little time
    on their t1. Now I&#39;m back home on rural dialup. Usually I don&#39;t bother
    trolling myfonts; if I can&#39;t pretty much get it off the top of my head or
    at arm&#39;s reach, then I don&#39;t bother. But man, t1 is great when I can get
    it. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    <BR>No, it&#39;s not Fluidum or Athenaeum or a Novarese font. It&#39;s an American
    release, for one thing. But nothing recent. <BR> <BR>What letter do you think
    this is? <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    that&#39;s not the font in question. But is it related somehow?

    italic has all sorts of wonderful energy. You should see the original metal --
    different from the digital in some subtle regards &#40;surprise, surprise&#41;.
    Much nicer, IMHO. Oh well. <BR> <BR>Take it away, Tiffany. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: Tiffany, where on earth did you find that? <BR> <BR>By the way, if anyone
    is designing an uppercase Eng, be aware that there are at least two different
    forms. The one Tiffany has is an example of the European Eng, which is used to
    write Northern Saami. There is another form which looks more like an oversize
    lowercase n with a curved right side and a hook at the baseline. This second form
    is used for many African languages. There is a third form which is similar to
    the latter, but with a descending hook. This seems to be a preferred glyph variant
    for some African languages.
