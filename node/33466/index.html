<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi, long time since I've been here
Here's the problem, recently my partner had to leave to continue her studies in another country, so I've decided it has come the time to refresh the identity and change the name.
The name I've decided to use on last was undu, the reasoning behind it might sound silly but it is a reminder on what not to do, in spanish (im from Mexico) to undo hears exactly the same as undu, and also when I started to draft over other names this one is the one that I think I would like to develop the most.
I understand this are simple letterforms, I want it to turn into a mark by itself and later attach a surname for the divisions which are starting to arise. (TV, print, web). However I've got 2 questions.
First: Which of the 3 would you choose, I know 2 is to trendy but i added it for comparison purposses.
Second: If you like 1 or 2 what font would you suggest to go with it, I was thinking along the lines of mic32 by t26 or Tarzana by emigre. But im not completely sure those font choices go on the spot.
Sorry for english if any critical mistakes are made during this brief writing.
Thanx in advance.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like both the name and logos 1 and 3 (you're right; 2 is not quite right). I really like how both are quite abstract but not difficult to decipher. Nice work! If I had to decide, I'd go with 3; it's a really cool mark, aside from having letters within it.
To go along with it, some suggestions are <a href=http://processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/index.html>Bryant 2</a>, which echoes the simplified letterforms in your logos (although you may or may not like the rounded ends).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you auric, im doing some more font research, and trying mix and match. while i like bryants simple letterforms I feel the rounded ends do affect the relationship. So im gona try to find something more contrasting. Ive been trying neutral fonts on pair with the 1 concept and they sime to go well. however im still looking for a rather modern sans, that goes with it dont want to be seduced by Helvetica this time. However helvetica rounded plays well with last mark but its not giving the message I want. I feel it too soft. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I think #1 is your best option right now. The recognition of the actual name is most effective here, while #3 may be mistaken for just an abstrasct symbol.
I think simple almost always works, so I wouldn't change #1 much. Perhaps try a typeface with rounded terminals? But I think the face you choce is the best choice for the space.
The frame of the logo seems a little tight...I would enlarge it by about an 1/8" of an inch. It seems tight in the upper left corner, especially because this is one of two places where the square terminal of the letterform approaches the rounded cornder of the frame. Visually, the breathing room around the perimeter on the left doesn't seem balanced to the right.
Hey, do me a favor...I could use some critique on my logo too - it's in the forum.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Using the same character for all the letterforms seems like a strong idea in and of itself. (<-- see mark to the left of this ;o)
Have you tried using #1 but with just the type all set on one line?
I like all of these ideas, but I'm wondering if they're perhaps a bit too much. Or, maybe you use one of them in combination with the UNDU set on one line. One being the wordmark, the other being the logo itself.

<div class=commentbody>well i treid a couple things. I really liked number 3 after a second review I feel the rounded square on no1 makes it stiffy however im having second thoughts after a discovery, undu3 is a big nosed man witha mullock.
Need help here. Tried bryant and it works really well. with no3

<div class=commentbody>Ty dave, indeed type looks the same but lighter. I knew too simple to risky im gona stick with the concepts 1 and 3 to avoid this. Without the wordmark to avoid relating to it. I bought Bryant and its lovely on headings etc. ill up more proofs as are developed. </div>

<div class=commentbody>nice...
youre lucky with those letters....i like the abstract mark where you have joined the letters....it aludes to a ' + ' symbol, although it throws up problems of recognising the letters, probably for that reason if it was me id go for teh third one along, its simple and i think these shapes could be useful, like used for arrows on your website etc...</div>

<div class=commentbody>i love the mark too (#3). it really lends itself to multiple applications. the one with the "eye" does look like a man with a mullett, but i also saw it as a bird (which may be fitting, as the eagle is mexico's national symbol).
love the flow of it...awesome
