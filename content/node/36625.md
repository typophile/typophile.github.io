  body: "I'm going to do this off the top of my head, rather than consulting the actual
    fonts first, so I may be inserting foot in mouth, but . . . \r\n\r\nI dislike
    the \"zero\" characters in Sabon and Stempel Garamond that are (respectively)
    a perfect circle, unstressed, and a character with equal weight on both sides
    and vertivcal rather than oblique stress. Both of these seem sharply arresting
    to my eye rather than flowing, because their personalities look (to my eye at
    least) so different from all their sibling glyphs. Do others find this charming
    in these two cases? Or are you also bothered by this? The Sabon 0 actually looks
    like a wrong font to me when combined with the other o.s. figs.\r\n\r\nBruce"

    the lowercase g.

  body: I despise the italic h where the leg curls back towards the stem. It comes
    from setting maths, and using 4 point sub-subscripts. Editors continually marking
    my work asking me to change the character to an h when it already was one. (at
    that size, especially on photocopies, it looks like a b.)

  body: Bruce, surely if those zero characters you dislike harmonized more with the
    rest of the alphabet, there would be a greater opportunity for confusing them
    with the letter "o"? Which typefaces have, in your opinion, zeroes that both harmonize
    and disambiguate?

    in lots of typefaces are WAY too bold in the heavier weights.

    they're quite accurate this way ...\r\n\r\nI cringe each time I see the lowercase
    italic g of Galliard, which otherwise is such a lovely typeface, sigh .."

  body: "Nick,\r\n\r\nI see your point about ambiguity, but wouldn't the context of
    most encounters tell me if I am looking at a lower-case oh or a zero? The reason
    I mentioned these two instances is that in both cases I find the characters to
    be jarring in their dissimilarity to all the other characters in the two fonts.\r\n\r\nI
    am only a user of types and not a designer, so I am well aware of all that I do
    not know. But Jackie asked the question, \"What are your peeves?\" and this was
    what first came to my mind. \r\n\r\nI don't have Stempel Garamond so cannot speak
    to that particular zero. but in the example I've furnished, I feel that the zeros
    blend more harmoniously with the rest of the characters in all the fonts shown,
    except Galliard and the two Sabons. Even though Adobe Garamond has a round zero
    similar to Sabon's, it manages to provide enough weight that it fits in. Both
    Dante and Bembo manage to give the zero less width, and less variation in stroke
    weight, than the oh, while still keeping the color of the characters similar.
    To my eye Galliard and Sabon have zeros that seem \"other,\" even if there is
    historical precedent for them to be that way (and I certainly do not deny this).
    It simply means that I am less attracted to using them because of these zeros.
    \r\n\r\nI am away from home so do not have my reference books, but did Tschichold
    make the zero this way right from the start in all three versions (lino, mono,
    foundry) and it never changed?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zeros_4066.jpg]"

  body: When a 2 makes a nearly closed circle, such as in Kabel and Bauhaus, it looks
    too much like a 9, it looks stupid, and it always used to bother me. But it's
    been a few decades since I've found any reason to use those faces regardless.

  body: The upside-down curved stroke of the question mark in Stempel Schneidler.
    It calls way too much attention to itself and detracts from smooth reading.

    that is interesting, because the characters you mention; the 'g' of Auto and the

  body: "Fontplayer, as a Finnish designer I can't cope with fonts without \xE4, \xE5
    and \xF6. It always depresses me to find a lovely font, and then to find out it's
    only meant for English typesetting, so that if I was to use it, I would have to
    build the umlauts myself (not a good idea). I'm sure other Europeans (not to mention
    non-latin letter users) have even more problems with the more unusual glyphs.\r\n\r\nI
    have a few fonts in my collection with just the basic English alphabet, and sometimes,
    if I'm lucky, I can use them for a headline or a short text, if there are no \"strange\"
    letters in the text. Rest of the time they're just gathering dust."
