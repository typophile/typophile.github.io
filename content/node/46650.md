  body: "Michael,\r\nJohn was at the last Type Con that I went to in Boston. It might
    be worth asking him if he'll be there. After all, there are 3 calligraphy teachers
    doing classes ( can't imagine who the other 2 are?? ). Not like the calligraphy
    conference, but he carries a lot of type related books and such. \r\nStephen"

  body: Letter Arts Review is pretty dang cool. You might want to see if any libraries
    carry it & if you are keen enough go ahead and start taking it.

    you see the not yet done Montague on this page:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/46452\r\n\r\nI
    named that after the town I lived in in Massachusetts before I started working
    for that design assembly line in Ohio. Hopefully in the next year I will move
    back and join the gainfully under-employed. \r\n\r\nIt will be fun seeing you
    at Typecon.\r\nStephen"
