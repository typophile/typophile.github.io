  to interpret scans of books printed by <strong>Simon de Colines</strong>. My question
  is: Has somebody done this before? Does it worth it?\r\n\r\nI really like the printer
  history and letterforms.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.ferfolio.com/files/colinet.jpg\"

  starting proyect PDF here]]</strong>\r\n\r\nThanks and kind Regards.\r\nF."
