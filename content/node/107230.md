  body: "The monogram looks like it uses  Monogram KK by koeiekat:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MonogramKK_4393.jpg]\r\nThe
    monogram squeezes the letters together.\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/monogram-kk.font\r\nKoeiekat's
    font information is that it is a curly monogram letter based on Victorian Initials.\r\nThere
    may be other fonts based on the same old initials.\r\nDon"
