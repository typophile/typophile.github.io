  is a great site and is very helpful.\r\n\r\nI need help identifying this script.
  I'm not sure if its a font or custom made, however I love the signature quality
  it has to it. It flows very nice, has hand-drawn features like at the end of certain
  letters you can see a slight \"dab\" of ink as if the pen was held down a little
  more to create this. I love those kind of features. It also has a jumpy/loopy quality
  almost like a 50s kind of script.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help me identify this or
  something that is very similar, that would be very appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you
  very much\r\n\r\nJonE."
