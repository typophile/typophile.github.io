body: "I just found an old lettering guide from Pratt that was my grandfather's. It
  consists of a greenish paper folio heavy white cardboard printed with black. The
  Author is William Longyear. The publishers are Bridgman Publishers Inc. Pelham NY.
  It has 13 plates plus an explanation sheet. There is no date on it but I am guessing
  it was made in the 1920's or 1930's based on what I know of my Gpa. It's not in
  super fantastic shape - but it isn't ruined either. Is this interesting to anyone?
  If you have seen it, or know it, is there anything you think that is useful to study
  in it? Thanks!\r\n\r\nHere are some samples"

  body: Hmmm, I just graduated from Pratt and took some type classes. Never was this
    book mentioned. You'd think the school would mention something this historical
    wouldn't you? Too bad I never got to see it until now.

  body: I've got a few plates from this set, too. I think the value depends on what
    you expect to learn. Not quite as useful as an old Speedball handbook, but certainly
    a start if you want to soak up some style from the past...

  body: "> original copy of Edward Johnston's <em>Writing and Illuminating and Lettering</em>
    (with diagrams and illustrations by the author and Noel Rooke).\r\n\r\nYes, a
    great book and an essential manual for calligraphers. I picked up my copy just
    after college. First published in 1906 by Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons Ltd. My version
    is the 1969 reprint by Pitman Publishing Corp., New York.\r\n\r\nAnother Pitman
    book I've used is <em>Roman Lettering</em> by L.C. Evetts (original printing 1938,
    my version reprint 1960). It has a long subtitle -- \"A Study of the Letters of
    the Inscription at the Base of the Trajan Column, with an Outline of the History
    of Lettering in Britain.\"\r\n\r\nMy personal favorite is just a tiny little book:\r\n<em>A
    Book of Scripts</em>, by Alfred Fairbank. Originally published in 1949 by T<em>he</em>
    K<em>ing</em> P<em>enguin</em> B<em>ooks</em>, my version revised and reprinted
    1960. This was our textbook used in Paul Standard's calligraphy class at The Cooper
    Union.\r\n"
