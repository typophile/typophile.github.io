  days and thought I should take the plunge and post up my first font for critique.
  Go ahead and be honest; I'm a big girl and can take it :) I'd rather have it be
  right, than have my precious feelings protected.\r\n\r\nSo, without further ado,
  here's GiddeHand, an approximation of my own handwriting."

  body: Looks nice. I question the top of the G being so open and vertical; it almost
    looks like an L to me.

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nAgreed on the G; I left it that way because that's actually
    how it looks when I write it, and I was starting to feel like I was tweaking the
    \"hand\" out of the handwriting. Is it really horrible, should I tweak it out
    anyway?\r\n\r\nEdit: Actually, that *is* tweaked, now that I look at it. When
    I actually write it, it's much more open and vertical ;)  So I suppose my question
    ought to be, should I tweak it *more*? :)"

  body: "After further reflection, that response was asinine and I apologize; of *course*
    you thought it needed tweaking or you wouldn't have posted the suggestion.\r\n\r\nSo
    in the interest of trying to *follow* the advice I asked for and was graciously
    given instead of \"do you really think so?\"-ing it, here is the result of my
    first attempt at tweaking that G.\r\n\r\nI vow that I will reflect *BEFORE* I
    respond in the future. Thanks again for taking a look and offering your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Sorry
    for the double post; for some reason the forum doesn't seem to want to accept
    a second edit on the last one.)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tweaked-G_5405.gif]"

  body: "Relax; mine is only one opinion, and it is perfectly reasonable to solicit
    others before doing anything. Goodness knows I don't hurry to follow every bit
    of advice I get.\r\n\r\nI see how this change may be stiffening up the G and losing
    some of the natural look of your handwriting. To get it back, I think the curve
    could <em>lean</em> forward to that point without having to <em>bend</em> so much,
    if you see my meaning. You could try using the curve of the C as a guide."

  body: My first thoughts were 'That's a left-handed girl', so if anybody needs that
    look it would be perfect. Don't start overworking it - that only leads to loss
    of spontaneity, and an element of 'stiffness' can start to creep in.

  body: "Thanks cerulean, I'll try that and see how it looks (I've been working on
    a copy in case I end up liking the original better).\r\n\r\nNick, everyone keeps
    saying that! I'm actually a right-handed girl, but I tend to really crank the
    paper to an angle before I write on it, so that backwards slant results. I didn't
    even realize I had a backwards slant until I tried to digitize it, and it was
    hard as heck not to try to *fix* it as I went. Which is why I was afraid to tweak
    much more. Thanks for the advice on overworking :)"

  body: Another tweak on the G, I lessened the curve and leaned it forward a bit instead;
    I also opened it back up a tad to try to get the original feel while still making
    it less L-like.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/G tweakage_4739.gif]

  body: "Very feminine, indeed.\r\nIt\u2019s nice how the letters connect so naturally!\r\nTo
    me, your /X/ stands out a bit \u2013 even more if compared to the way you write
    your lc x, but who am I to judge your handwriting \u2026 :)\r\n\r\nAnd, as Nick
    said, overworking would kill the spontaneity.\r\n\r\nEdit: It\u2019s funny \u2013
    usually the geometry and evenness of the lines give away that it is a font. But
    your writing is very balanced and even in colour so it works quite well IMO.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    wondering if the space is slightly too big compared to \u2018real\u2019 handwriting?"

  body: "Thanks for the comments, Joerg. I don't really like that /X/ either ... unfortunately
    I didn't have any \"native\" samples of a capital x in all of my handwritten stuff
    I went through to try to get samples from before I decided to make a font -- when
    one knows they're writing a sample for a font, it's less natural-looking. :( I'll
    have to see if I can come up with one that matches the rest a little better.\r\n\r\nThanks
    cerulean! I like this version too, gonna put it into the \"official\" font."
