body: "Hey folks, I was at the theatre the other day and I saw a poster for zorro.
  Zorro? Wasn't that out like, five years ago or something. Closer look, the burning
  Z is also a 2. Very clever, I think. Take a look at the first poster for 'the legend
  of zorro '\r\n\r\nUpdate / take a look at the top crossbar. Slightly angled and
  slightly curved from the original. Side by side comparison on new pic."

  body: That is barely a 2, but I suppose it works. At least the movie will have Anotinio
    Banderas in it, so it has that going for it.

      no, its not a \r\n'proper' 2, but the initial draw leads to the realization
      of its 2ness."

    this come out a few years ago?" It's a nice move, but too subtle for us.
