  I have an old solotype catalog which I have been referencing. And while many of
  the typefaces are common, others aren't and I can't even find them via google.\r\n\r\nFor
  example,\r\n\r\nGrand Wood\r\nGrandiose\r\nLattice\r\nMadison\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know if these are digitized and for sale anywhere?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\u2013Nic\r\n"
