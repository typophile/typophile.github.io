		<div class="commentbody">This is a very interesting question. Typeface nationality/ethnicity is seen by some as too subjective to bother with.

Suburban and Collis couldn't be further apart, even though their designers had the same teacher. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But there <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> something there. And sometimes (although rarely) it's pretty clear, like when Adam Twardoch points out that Polish diacritics should tilt more. Other times is highly contentious, like when Ladislas Mandel insists that French fonts must have smaller x-heights. I'd say that usually it's a matter of getting enough people to agree, like that Czech fonts have a certain &quot;fauve&quot; aspect&hellip; maybe? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What would be killer is if somebody sat down and did a serious paper on this, collecting historic and contemporary samples, asking opinions, distilling the whole, and giving us a set of sufficiently usable conclusions for each culture, while noting how tenable each given &quot;conclusion&quot; really is. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You should look at a copy of D.B. Updike's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Printing Types,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which shows a country-by-country history of Western typeface design from the earliest printing in the 1400s up to the time the book was written (I have the two-volume 1937 edition). Here's the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->current edition<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You can also find used copies, but this tends to be an expensive book (or books). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first edition was written in the 1920s, then revised in 1937. I believe it was revised a couple of times later, but to me the most valuable information is the early history of printing and type design. The book includes numerous reproductions of book pages and type specimen sheets. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William Morris' Kelmscott Press books in the 1890s started a revival of interest in historical printing types. However, little was known of the history of type design, and one of the only ways to learn about it at the time was to look at antique books; little scholarship had been done. This is one of the earliest and is still the most exhaustive survey of printing history that I'm aware of. Updike can be opinionated and a little cranky at times - for instance, he obviously dislikes Baskerville's type, even though he used a very similar typeface for his own book. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not sure how much you know about the history of typography (so forgive me if I'm talking down to you), but you may be surprised at how old some of the typefaces we commonly use today are. The various versions of Garamond are based on French typefaces from the 1600s, and Baskerville and Caslon, two very popular English typefaces for modern book design, date from the 1700s (and were both used by Benjamin Franklin). Centaur and the various versions of Jenson are based on Italian designs from the 1400s. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Early Roman typefaces fell into rough groups that could be generally classified as Italian, French and Dutch/English, and modern revivals based on them still retain many of these characteristics. The best type designers are very aware of the characteristics across both time and place, and generally don't mix incompatible features from different traditions or eras. For instance, the modern Minion typeface looks very French. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The early European printers used blacketter typefaces (examples are Old English and the German Frakturs), which each had distinctive national characteristics. Roman type originated in Italy in the late 1400s. Originally used mostly for setting texts in Latin, it replaced blackletter for almost all printing within about 100 years. German-speaking countries were the main exception, and continued to use Fraktur (the German version of blackletter) up until the end of WWII. The Nazis decided that san-serif typefaces undermined German culture; in all seriousness, some designers who used san-serif type actually attracted the attention of the Gestapo. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It makes sense to be aware of the history of the typeface that you use for a particular project, to avoid making unintentional typographic jokes. For instance, it would look odd to use an classic English or Italian typeface for a book about Rennaisance French history when there are a large number of excellent Rennaisance French text typefaces to choose from. The same is true of things like menus and signage; you can often use type to reinforce a national or ethnic theme. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Take care, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Paul</div>

Their typographic features seem to emulate their arts and lifestyle, even landscape, could that be why the glyphs were forms that way? who knows.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Inuktitut syllabic writing system is directly derived from the Cree/Ojibwe system, originally conceived by the Methodist missionary James Evans. The Anglican missionary Edmund Peck introduced the successful writing system to the Inuit. It is not a script that originates in or has any connection to pre-Christian Inuit culture, but the Inuit have since made it their own and are very proud of it. [It is also worth noting that most Inuit art you see is not traditional: soapstone carving was introduced to the Inuit only in the later 20th century.] <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The geometry of the Canadian syllabics derives from the very crude type making methods developed by James Evans in the far north of Manitoba. He carved matrices in the endgrain of wood, and found straight lines easier to work with. The difficulties of making type under such conditions also led to the most distinctive aspect of the script: the rotation of symbols to indicate different vowel sounds. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When my colleague Ross Mills was designing the Pigiarniq and Uqammaq typefaces for the government and land use corporation in Nunavut, he found the Inuit to be quite open to novelties such as an increased number of rounded forms. This is a healthy sign: people are more conservative and protective of their writing system when they feel their culture to be under threat. When people are confident in their culture, they can afford to take a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->laissez-faire<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attitude and allow experiment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For more information on Inuktitut syllabics, see Ross' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->website.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The section 'Typefounding on the Frontier' has photos of Ross' recreation of Evans's type making technology.</div>
