  body: Very nice! Maybe M & N could do with a little weight loss on the diagonals.
    S seems a little light.

  body: "Just a few quick comments:\r\n\r\nI think the round letters and also A, V,
    W could use (more) overshoot. Like they are now, they look too small.\r\n\r\nI
    think the accents are a bit too light. The ogonek should be aligned to the right
    side on the E, as it is on the A.\r\n\r\nThe S looks quirky (I haven't checked
    with Eagle, perhaps it's similar there). The transition from the straight line
    to the curve on top of B and D has a small bump.\r\n\r\nThe left and right part
    of the O look too light compared to the top and bottom part, their weight needs
    optical correction (same goes for G and Q).\r\n\r\nNice effort though, keep it
    going :)\r\n\r\nJens"

  body: "Thanks for the help. I\u2019ve updated the original post with a new sample
    image and specimen. Here\u2019s the rundown:\r\n\u2022 Many spacing and kerning
    tweaks.\r\n\u2022 All diacritical marks are larger/heavier.\r\n\u2022 Fixed Eogonek\r\n\u2022\_Round
    letters are now wider and overshoot farther.\r\n\u2022 S is wider. The old version
    was based on the original, which was pretty gross.\r\n\u2022 A, M, N, V, and W
    now have pointy tips. I felt that this gave the face character that Coiner\u2019s
    drawings had and the ATF metal type lost."

  body: "Hrm; I feel almost like the diacitics don't necessarily need to be heavier,
    but that they do need to be much wider, almost crossing the entire letter.  These
    have such a block feel it's a bit odd to see them so skinny on both the X and
    Y scale. That's fine on the Y but the X needs to be a good bit bigger.  I dunno
    how the original drawings were. \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan

  body: "I considered going with larger diacritics, but there\u2019s a problem of
    diminishing returns, aesthetics get worse as scale increases. To make the marks
    look good and be wider the marks need to become more chirographic (like Whitney
    by TFJ) and then they don\u2019t harmonize well with the letters, and marks like
    ring and circumflex get gigantic.\r\n\r\nThe original designs by Coiner and Benton
    didn\u2019t have any diacritics. These are American letters from the 1930s that
    were intended to be used by a government agency and business tied to it. I don\u2019t
    think that these letters would look like this if they had been designed for use
    in Europe. I guess that this is a novelty font to the core!"
