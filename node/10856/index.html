		<div class="commentbody">sean, thanks. I think I'm with you about the &quot;L&quot; in 1 and the &quot;B&quot; in 2. I'm going to look into working that in to version 1. <BR> <BR>Also the modulation you suggested was what I naturally went for at first but I thought that it was detracting from the mark, but that was on much earlier and rougher versions, and I've been thinking I'd look into it again. I realize that currently it's not how it would work if the pen was held at a cosistent angle troughout. <BR> <BR>As for the color of the mark I'm quite sure that I don't want to go any heavier with the face used for the name, so I'd have to lighten the mark. Is this what you mean? <BR> <BR>Hrant, good call on Isadora, it was the face I looked at most when coming up with this. I have tried it for &quot;photography&quot; but the client is really not into it. He feels it is just what you would expect. I think it goes well with the mark but am with him on not using it (or any other scripts). Especially since the bold weight of Isadora seems the best match and is overpowering to the name. But if anyone feels that the helvetica is quite an eyesore in this please speak up. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the critique. I'd love to hear more from anyone. <BR> <BR>mitchell</div>

I am sure that  <BR>I like the strokes on the second one better when  <BR>they do not wrap as much. It is getting there in  <BR>my opinion but it still needs some clean up on <BR>those curvy arm things.  <BR> <BR> I wish someone else would share their opinion. <BR> <BR>I am a little worried about the top of the &quot;L&quot;  <BR>disappearing at smaller sizes.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Mitchell, <BR> <BR>I think you're off to a lovely start with the mark and agree it would look excellent embossed. I'd like to speak to the text for a minute. I think there are a three issues to consider: <BR> <BR>1) I thing you've got too many styles working in one logo. There's the script mark, the serif name, and sans photography. I think you would do well to limit the design in this regard.  <BR> <BR>2) Given that your mark is really calligraphic with diagonal stress and large variance in stroke weight, It probably makes sense to choose a serif type with similar properties. One that comes to mind that would keep the feel of what you've got going is Poetica small caps (I wouldn't use any of the swashes, keep it simple and let your mark do the talking). As an alternative, maybe try a script. While I can see the why Hrant would point you towards Isadora, in this case I think its the wrong choice. I'd first try a spencerian script. <BR> <BR>3) I think the current arrangement of mark and logotype are out of proportion/position. In a mark-on-left arrangement, I'd reduce it's size by at least 70%. Also try a centered arrangement. <BR> <BR>On a side note, two fashion faces that come to mind that are at least as prolific as helvetica&hellip; Optima and Didot, neither of which would work with your mark. (So helpful!) <BR> <BR>BTW, I don't mind the heavier circle/O. <BR> <BR>Good Luck, <BR>Randy <BR></div>

I think this latest version is better in that regard, even with the thick strokes. <BR> <BR>Randy, I think I'm in agreement on the proportions and the reduction of styles. I know that Brian is quite pleased (settled) with Candida for the name (so am I, by itself at least) Though other fonts better match the mark. Well, he's actually quite pleased with it all, and I think he will more or less take my opinion on where to go with the mark. I'm definetly still trying to figure it all out though. <BR> <BR>in case anyone's interested, a little history to show how I arrived here: <BR> <BR>First came the wordmark because Brian and I had agreed that most important was his name and it should be able to stand alone. A mark would be great but just a name would be fine. What Brian was looking for was coming out of the advertisements in the magazine <i>Elegant Bride</i> and logotypes like Gucci, Armani, Donna Karan. Think the <a href="http://www.orangeitalic.com/luxury/">Luxury collection</a> from Orange Italic. I showed a few faces and a few marks but no marks grabbed him, and the Candida mark was what he liked. <BR> <BR>Then on the business cards and such, we needed to identify what he offered. So &quot;photography&quot; was added (but should not have to appear everyhere his logo does). Being there no monogram (third style) yet, the fashionable helvetica extended was chosen. <BR> <BR>Then I was inspired by <a href="http://www.boguslav.com/"> this excellent work</a> and the work in</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Great work Mitchell. <BR> <BR>I am putting out a strong vote for 4.2A. This  <BR>is clearly my favorite.  It has the strongest  <BR>negative vs. positive relationship. I also think <BR>it will look better at small sizes than the others.  <BR>That  top of the &quot;L&quot; has really been cleaned  <BR>up. Now, I would account for a bit of  ink  <BR>trapping there to avoid plugging it up when  <BR>printing it. <BR> <BR> As for earlier comments concerning ' the  <BR>unintentional letter &quot;O&quot; &hellip;that detracts  <BR>attention from what should be the focus' ,  <BR>I would argue, particularly with the latest  <BR>changes you have made, that this is not true.  <BR>In reality the shape is a clear continuation of  <BR>the letter forms. In fact, I believe that it is the  <BR>thinner lines are guilty of distracting from the  <BR>letters. In this case they are really something  <BR>other than parts of the letter forms. They  <BR>are disconnected. <BR> <BR>Hey, Mitchell that is a great link by the way. Thanks. <BR> <BR>-smc <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

I've not been around as I am swamped and had pretty much ran out of (paid) time for this logo and needed to finish it up. Of course, Jean has me inspired all over again.

However, now that we've seen that a double line, of the same thickness, can be very nice with the added bonus of getting a hint of your original idea.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Don't know what mean &quot;southpaw.&quot; But not, I'm right handed. <BR> <BR>I think I finally understood what you mean. Is because I used a brush rather than a calligraphic pen. When you do brush lettering, heavy parts are not modulated same way, and in this case, its usefull, because more close to &quot;copperplate style&quot; (when a job need to be done quickly in small size, here 5 minutes).  <BR> <BR>Mitchell: I think the double lines can be more lighter than in my attempt. 10/20% less to equilibrate more with normal heavy parts. no? <BR></div>
