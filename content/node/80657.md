  The primary audience is upperclass mothers with young kids. I am torn between several
  different typographic voices to pair with the mark and would love to get some feedback.
  On one hand I am looking at Rosewood Fill with its unrelenting quirkiness. It seems
  to pair nicely with the mark in terms of height, contrast and intent. But my fear
  with Rosewood is that it will get old really fast and will severely limit the growth
  of this brand. On the other hand I am looking at a clean sans; Neutra to be exact.
  I feel like it is a nice reflection of the star graphic\u2014which is going to be
  another element of this identity system. But I am still not 100% convinced with
  either of these choices. Appreciate any and all feedback. "

    That could be manually adjusted of course.\r\n\r\n"

    with a star is just not memorable (sorry, but it's true) so the type needs to
    stand out. If your target market is affluent women, look for something more \"upscale
    boutique.\" Right now, you've chosen fonts that are used by some of the biggest,
    broadest brands in America - Cellular One and Starbucks. Their target market is
    strongly gender neutral. Yours is not....but so far, your logo is very neutral.
    \r\n\r\nIf it were me? I'd spend some time on [[http://sudtipos.com/home|Sudipos
    Foundry]] at more organic typefaces. Primavera or Lombriz might work, or even
    something like Romy or Semilla. I'd also go window shopping at some little exclusive,
    over-priced women's boutiques and look at labels and jewelry for inspiration.
    (Oh, and <strong>not</strong> at the mall --  independent little shops, like on
    Newbury Street in Boston. The kind of places fools pay $50. for cashmere socks.)"

    I will certainly investigate Sudtipos site and see what they have to offer. Thanks
    again for the feedback."
