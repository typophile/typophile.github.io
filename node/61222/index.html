<p>IKEA abandons ~50 years of Futura and Century Schoolbook for … Verdana. 
In an interview with swedish design magazine CAP&amp;DESIGN the reason for the change is to be able to use the same font i all countries, including asian countries. Also they want to be able to give the same visual impression both in print and the web.</p>
<p>For me it&rsquo;s a sad day.

<p>That’s what made me think it had to be custom work. I just couldn’t imagine a serious catalog design employing a screen text face for printed display work. I really think that this is a nasty case of a business being cheap. Ikea is one of the world’s largest and most successful corporations; the only reason the founder’s family are not among the world’s wealthiest billionaires is that Sweden’s progressive taxation encouraged them to transfer ownership to a charity. For Ikea commissioning a complete international Futura family with optical styles would still be a drop in the bucket. For a company that constantly touts it’s own staff designers to go this route is pretty pathetic.</p>

<p>There’s a difference between financial pragmatism and just being cheap. The value of the Ikea brand has got to be tremendous, and they’ve spent decades and billions of dollars getting there. Changing to Verdana has given Ikea’s catalogs a very different feel—Verdana at large sizes simply does not have the warmth and cheer of Futura, a reaction that seems important in selling furniture to young people with tight budgets. I would argue that making such a dramatic change to the visual identity of such a valuable brand has potential costs that are much higher than the cost of extending Futura to cover more languages. If Ikea has to do one big ad campaign in the US and Europe to reinforce the new identity they might spend more than they would have to extend Futura.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have hoped they would have done some kind of study on that. But if not I&rsquo;ll be interested to see if their downward sales spiral is ever associated with the font change, and they change back, or change up. A grand experiment, to be sure.</p>

<p>The founder has moved to Switserland years ago, to one of these cantons where taxation is based on the value of your house and not on your income. Plus the brand has been put into a separate company that is also based in the land of chocolate and friendly bankers. The individual branches of IKEA have to pay for the use of the brand, which is just an inventive way to skim profits.</p>
<p>Mr IK has some other quirks: he was quite enamored by Hitler and Nazism, but that is not unique amongst Swedes. As a country Sweden profited immensely from trafficking in WW2 and trading natural resources and industrial products with the Nazi-regime.</p>
<p>And then there is the policy of this company that chokes suppliers for the lowest possible prices and everything that results from that: pseudo-slavery, exploitation of natural resources in ecologically weak environments, etcetera.</p>
<p>NOT a nice company. Too bad that they are giving Verdana a bad rep.

<p>Kidding. But why didn’t they just extend the Ikea Sans further? They already own it. Instead go through another process to license and customize Verdana for the whole corporation?</p>
<p>Verdana is wrong on so many levels. UGH! Its less readable, prone to more clotting on the press or looking clotted and forget about elegance. Myriad, Avneir, even Lucida or Vera would look much better. And if your think about standard Windows fonts shouldn’t Tahoma been the main choice as Verdana is the extended version of Tahoma?</p>
<p>Sorry Nick, Helvetica would have looked great. Tho Akzidenz would have been better.</p>
<p>I’m highly disappointed with the new change. But hey, maybe they’ll release their old stuff.</p>
<p>Bert, I agree with some the of the criticisms lodged against IKEA, however Ingvar Kamprad has gone on the record saying that regret being involved with the Nazi movement and that he cut off all ties in 1950’s:
<a href="http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/15415/swedish-goulash-and-sofas-whet-israeli-appetites-at-netanya-ikea/">http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/15415/swedish-goulash-and-sofas-whet-israeli-appetites-at-netanya-ikea/</a></p>

I really like Verdana for what it was meant for.  It needs so much handwork to be used as a print display face that it is counterproductive. They would have been better off to have hired Matthew to make a corporate version for them that looks respectable as a corporate display face.</p>

<p>That comes back to my suggestion that maybe IKEA (or the agency) did some kind of research (focus groups etc.,) that did not involve a disproportionate number of graphic designers, web engineers and type designers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m far too close to the font to judge how well it works.</p>

<p>I think that it works just fine in print at text sizes. At larger sizes some of the features that make it work well small start to look really horsey, such as the terminals of C, G, J, Q, and S. When it gets blown up and used vertically that kind of stuff just looks weird.</p>

It&rsquo;s a screen font, not graceful at display size, and lacking in subtlety.

<p>I know where you haters are coming from. I still cringe at the thought that people used Chicago as a display face before more fonts became available for the masses to abuse. I&rsquo;m loving this use of Verdana though. Who knew that using such a plain looking typeface as Verdana could be so subversive?

<p>I think you&rsquo;re one generation off. Although Lucida existed (and was bundled with various Microsoft products) well before Verdana was created, I don&rsquo;t think anyone was using it as a UI font. Verdana was conceived as a UI font, and with bitmaps created first (before having the outlines wrapper around them and then hinted to produce the desired bitmap patterns) it owes more to say Chicago, than Lucida. In fact at ATypI I showed some of the preliminary Verdana bitmaps which were very Chicago-like.</p>
<p>For those getting hung up on the “it’s a web font” complaint, I really think you should get out more. There’s a whole world beyond the computer screen! Do you complain when you see Frutiger used in print “That’s an airport signage font!” or Gotham used on a sign, “that’s a magazine font!”? ;-)</p>

<p>Si, I&rsquo;m almost certain that Lucida Sans was the default UI font in Slo-aris' X11 window manager. Back in their pink and purple days before Larry Ellison showed up and turned them orange. Or Tan In A Can, if you will.</p>
<p>One of the first things I do when I get a Windows box is turn off the candy theme, switch to the Windows 2000 theme and make all the UI widget fonts a small version of Lucida Sans. Very efficient and pleasant.</p>

<hr>
<p>but that&rsquo;s the beauty of Futura! rather than pure geometry, it references the underlying classical skeleton. stretched to the bold weight and used large (as in Ikea&rsquo;s more attractive past) it&rsquo;s a perfect fit for Ikea&rsquo;s contemporary modernist focus.</p>

Let&rsquo;s not loose sight of the experience. The internet is not all of it with Ikea. Not even close. Think the product. The experience matters most at POS.

It is subversive for people who understand typography, and who will discuss it; end-user, customer will hardly even notice. For most of end-users it is just letters.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Customers not noticing or caring while designers are all in a twitter is exactly why I think it’s subversive. It’s just like when a client demands the use of Times New Roman and you use Palatino and they never notice, but love your work.</p>
<p>I’m very amused by this uproar. I’m speculating that most of the people in a twittfit would have never noticed it was Verdana being used if it weren’t pointed out to them. Yet they are voicing strong opinions. (I’m excluding the well versed old-schoolers like Nick and Chris who I firmly believe have a good grasp of their reasoning beyond it merely being a screen font, and probably don’t twitter either.)</p>
<p>For me there is great irony here. Simon has this one pegged. When the print font is used on the web no one bats an eye. Where is the outrage when someone uses Futura or Univers on the web or use any of the other fonts developed before screen displays? They weren’t intended for use on a screen. And then how many other text fonts have been used as a display face in recent history with no one caring?</p>
<p>Yes IKEA could’ve and should’ve used another face. But I’m glad they made this move to provide me hours of entertainment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;outraged&rdquo; for years that Georgia doesn&rsquo;t have a display size for the web, and that Verdana doesn&rsquo;t have Light weights for the web. The readability of display size was something that was overlooked in the design of web technology, and yet that technology readily permits display size, with the type looking extremely horsey. Times is the best &ldquo;web&rdquo; face for display size, because the serifs have some sharpness.</p>

<p>I would guess that it&rsquo;s a very high up upper management decision to cut costs/time for the process and an easier way to follow up outsourced projects to other designers or local offices.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really care what font they use really&hellip; not sure why all the fuss and emotional attachment to this brand. To me IKEA is a huge commercial (less on the creative) practical entity.</p>
<p>Verdana is widely seen and in our culture more than we like it to, overused and is in everyone&rsquo;s homes (internet browsers/OS system). So in spirit, Verdana is much like Ikea.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>An international company catering to just Europe alone has to deal with over twenty different languages, many of which have their own specific character sets. If you take into account that you also have to support Russian and Greek, that alone rules out a lot of fonts you can choose from.</p>
<p>The alternative is having to deal with different typefaces for different languages, but that is a pain and doesn&rsquo;t solve the real problem at hand. The fact is, there is a huge lack of fonts that support a large set of international character sets.</p>
<p>So faced with similar problem I imagined Ikea had, I did some research into this not so long ago and came to the conclusion that Microsoft is the only one that consistantly supports all the different character sets in their fonts. Another plus is that they are also adapted to screen viewing. The only downside is that per typeface, they only provide four fonts: regular, italic, bold and bold italic.</p>
<p>The most usuable typeface I found for Europe was Myriad Pro which does offer a wider range of weights. But if you have to deal with Arabic or Asian languages, you can also rule this one out.</p>
<p>So if you want to go global and remain consistant everywhere, the Microsoft typefaces are the only viable choice at the moment. I can understand it is a mammoth undertaking, but I just wish they would affor a larger set of weights and that also the other foundries would follow suit.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Excellent points Nick. Maybe all of the uproar will prompt IKEA to commission a project to expand the font, or create a custom solution. I would say maybe it will prompt Microsoft to do so, but then there&rsquo;s that reality vs. fantasy thing.</p>
<p>As it is implemented, this seems to me to be a classic example of letting the form follow the function. Using Verdana is a highly functional and instant solution to their situation. Other than Helvetica I don&rsquo;t think there is another choice.</p>
<p>As to the thought that of course IKEA has the money to commission a custom face, I&rsquo;m sure they do but the people that make those decisions within the company don&rsquo;t sit around sipping coffee talking about what font they are going to use for promotional material and ads. In fact that begs the question, how much revenue will they potentially lose by using the low/no cost solution versus the added costs of an expensive custom font or the continued use of different fonts for multiple regions? Other than typophiles does anyone else notice or care?</p>

<p>However, a number of foundries (not Adobe, Microsoft and Apple, which aren&rsquo;t foundries) have recently released &ldquo;Euro&rdquo; fonts that support Latin, Greek and Cyrillic encoding. My effort: The Modern Suite. Admittedly, foundry fonts are unlikely to be hinted for PC screens, but this is an aesthetic issue that may be compared against the print shortcomings of the &ldquo;web&rdquo; fonts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is the real issue for Ikea, which seems to be that in the holy trinity of product criteria, Price and Convenience have trumped Quality. That&rsquo;s a legitimate decision for Ikea; I&rsquo;m suggesting it may weaken the brand&ndash;not for reasons of typographic aesthetics per se; in that sense, &ldquo;Quality&rdquo; means the quality of being distinctive.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I took these pictures before I realized it was Verdana. And that Futura catalogue in the pictures was really one of the reasons I wanted to become a graphic designer.
[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/six_7_8/sets/72157622017139377/|Flickr Set]]</p>
<p>I was a bit shocked a couple of weeks ago when I was looking at their catalogue but I just thought the local designer screwed up here in Toronto. It didn&rsquo;t even cross my mind that someone would advise the company to make a change like this.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;web&rdquo; reason given for the change doesn&rsquo;t even hold. Go to their [[http://www.ikea.ca/|website]] and look at how many times Verdana is used as an anti-alias image (doesn&rsquo;t it kill the whole purpose of using a web font?). But I don&rsquo;t blame the web designers because who in the world wants a dull html website that looks like 1995?</p>
<p>The &ldquo;consistency&rdquo; reason given isn&rsquo;t working any better. I think we all agree the IKEA brand was pretty consistent at least up until the &ldquo;change&rdquo;. But it is now during that transition that the inconsistency will occur. Graphic devices and headlines designed using IKEA Sans are still in use in print and on the web. Wasn&rsquo;t it the job of the design firm that suggested the &ldquo;change&rdquo; to redesign all these little logos?</p>
<p>I feel this is almost unethical on the part of the design firm. I don&rsquo;t think they added any value with the changes they made. It wasn&rsquo;t even a rebranding; they obviously wanted to maintain the image of the company (I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it but it&rsquo;s basically the IKEA image). The layout of the catalogue is maintained (white backdrop for the most part, big black headlines, bold vs regular in the item descriptions and body text. So the only thing the design firm has done here is take one successful element out.</p>
<p>Maybe an added value was the cost of design on the long term? And Nick you said &ldquo;Price and Convenience have trumped Quality&rdquo; but I was under the impression that they can distribute their proprietary font to their service providers at no cost. Or am I wrong? How is Verdana cheaper?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->sii said: &ldquo;For those getting hung up on the “it’s a web font” complaint, I really think you should get out more. There’s a whole world beyond the computer screen! Do you complain when you see Frutiger used in print “That’s an airport signage font!” or Gotham used on a sign, “that’s a magazine font!”? ;-)&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Bad comparison. Frutiger and Gotham were never developed for use in a medium totally out of spec with print methods, so it is not comparable with using a screen font in printed matter. Verdana was developed for Microsoft with the intent of being readable at small sizes on a computer screen. Not print. Or signage. A computer screen. I am sure if MS told Carter to keep print in mind when designing Verdana, the results would have been a masterful typographic fusion of web and print compatibility.</p>
<p>In regard to Gotham being used on a sign, it was a typeface that was inspired by signage to begin with. : )</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t get, is if IKEA wanted to have a smooth transition between mediums, they should have opted for Frutiger in their print materials, which is a very comparable counterpart to Verdana.</p>

<p>Perhaps not fully web and print compatible (as you alluded to) but certainly more than it is now. And whose to say that he may not have taken the road of developing a larger set of fonts under the Verdana family to accommodate both mediums?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think Verdana Regular is made for, and excellent at, small sizes independent of output resolution.

<p>Certainly they do. But then display sizes, as used in IKEA&rsquo;s catalog, do not share the same requirements that smaller sizes do. Therein lies the core of the problem with IKEA&rsquo;s decision to use Verdana, unless they intend on using nothing but small print in their collateral.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What about the web then? Do you know how much it’d cost to license Frutiger for web-serving to the public?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I suggested Frutiger as Verdana&rsquo;s print alternative, being they have certain similarities (vague or otherwise) in their letter forms. Not necessarily in place of Verdana on the web. Just a good pairing so that their brand&rsquo;s visual language is still in tact across the web and print, without resorting to using a screen font for larger sized executions.</p>

<p>Verdana is NOT a bad font. It is a font that is overexposed (which culturally tends to cause problems. Reference: Phil Collins, circa 1985) - but Verdana does have some wonderful Matthew Carter-esque details that makes it a beautiful type family.</p>

<p>Would you say that the Frutiger typeface was &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by Ad Sans (Humanist 970)?</p>
<p>I would imagine that Matthew Carter was aware of Ad Sans, Frutiger, and Myriad, but didn&rsquo;t refer to them while working on Verdana, as his primary objective was to design a type that worked well as bitmaps at several low-pixel heights.</p>

<p>As mentioned in my ATypI talk last year and in various interviews with Matthew over the years, he designed the bitmaps first, then the outlines. Then Tom Rickner hinted the outlines to produce the original bitmap designs. In this process I don&rsquo;t really see how other outline type designs could have directly informed the design.</p>

As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, that is actually a good reason to switch to a different typeface. Maybe the big, globally-successful IKEA wanted to differentiate themselves from other ginormous entities that use Futura. Honestly, what does the company have in common with e.g., Volkswagon, other than the same typeface? Maybe a different typeface than Verdana would have been a better choice, but they can fix that later if they want. They&rsquo;ve made a huge first step by breaking with their past. Somehow, I doubt that they&rsquo;ll stick with Verdana for 60 years.</p>
<p>Also, Matthew Carter is just a better designer than Paul Renner was ;-)
I know which team that I&rsquo;d rather root for.</p>

<p>In the BoConcept&rsquo;s german version catalogue of last year, the graphic design unit made a good job working with (only) Verdana – i even saw it as large type in windows. Really ok/good job!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->DISCLAIMER: The following is my personal point of view on the situation and does not reflect the views of my employer or the views of any branch of IKEA, past, present or future. None of the following is to be considered factual.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Now that the cat&rsquo;s outta the bag so to speak. I&rsquo;ve been working with IKEA for a while and learned about the switch to Verdana about a year ago. The reasons I heard internally were pretty much verbatim to those heard in the CAP&amp;Design article. Now, I&rsquo;m not a designer, although I would like to think that I keep a keen eye on things beautiful.</p>
<p>I am however, a software developer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on most of the dynamic content available on the IKEA website and am very well entrenched in the technical issues of localization. While the issue of type is readily apparent at first visual glance, there is more to it than meets the eye. First, you&rsquo;ve got to realize that IKEA publishes content all over the world. In multiple alphabets. Producing said content with a consistent visual style is a daunting task, not only for the content producers but for us writing the tools they use as well. Now, disregarding the daunting nature of this task, even disregarding any of the visual aspects of the production such as tracking and kerning etc, there&rsquo;s one technical issue that always lingering about as a dark cloud on an otherwise pretty fair sky — file size.</p>
<p>Fonts are expensive in terms of file size. Sure, your average font with the letters and numerals and some subset of special characters isn&rsquo;t all that bad. But slap on the chinese alphabet or the japanese alphabet and you&rsquo;re looking at pushing several hundred kb if not several mb down the tube. One can use a subset of the alphabet, it&rsquo;s after all highly unlikely that all glyphs are used at the same time, but you rack up the file size pretty quickly anyway. And if you do send specific glyphs down the tube, there&rsquo;s no intelligent caching to take care of already downloaded fonts so you&rsquo;ll be resending the same data over and over.</p>
<p>It may not be that expensive for IKEA to license the rights to Futura (or IKEA Sans as their version was called), but bandwidth sure is. And it&rsquo;s a running cost. In the ubiquitous nature of the internet it is easily forgotten that serious bandwidth costs serious money. I don&rsquo;t have up-to-date figures, but I know the daily unique visitor count on IKEAs website globally is well into the millions. Daily. Yes, they have pretty advanced co-location caching solutions, but it&rsquo;s all very expensive stuff to keep running efficiently.</p>
<p>You may ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ok, it&rsquo;s expensive to keep this running, but what about the user experience? Doesn&rsquo;t that count for something?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure it does. In fact, it&rsquo;s even more important than the costs of running it all. In fact, that&rsquo;s why their pushing that serious amount of energy and money into running it. But when asking that question, you have to ask if the user experience on the web is purely visual? Well, it&rsquo;s not. Looking in a printed catalogue I understand you all, I even agree with most of you. But on the web we&rsquo;ve had to come up with quite technically challenging solutions. Reconnecting with what I said previously, fonts costs in terms of file size. They are NOT cheap. And @font-face won&rsquo;t help much, you still have to push the font as any other digital resource. It&rsquo;s also notoriously difficult to cache fonts properly. This is a file type issue I&rsquo;d presume. You simply can&rsquo;t stream selected glyphs and still have a usable font file, you need to dynamically create one. Anything dynamically created is impossible to cache because of it&rsquo;s dynamic nature. At one time, it&rsquo;s one set of glyphs, at another it&rsquo;s a different set. Coming back to the issue of user experience, file size and bandwidth determines load times. It&rsquo;s really that simple. We can&rsquo;t display what we need to display before we have all the resources to do so. We display as soon as possible and load as lazily as possible (when it&rsquo;s needed), but in order to keep the user interested we need to do serious optimizations to keep the loading times as small as possible. Even in low-bandwidth situations.</p>
<p>So what to do?</p>
<p>Well, we implemented a way of pushing IKEA Sans onto the client in countries where the alphabet was cheap. This includes most western countries. For other alphabets, such as cyrillic, greek, chinese or japanese, we defaulted back to verdana and only produced headings and other selected parts in IKEA Sans, pushing only those glyphs that were necessary to keep the filesize down. It worked well, we managed to keep the loading times as small as possible while still being able to at least come to some sort of decent compromise in visual quality on the web. But the difficulty of caching and the fact that the visual style was anything but consistent is what I think finally pushed IKEA to the switch. You or I may not agree with the decision, but looking at the sheer volume of visitors IKEA get — both in the stores and online — you realize that even a 1% drop due to load times or other look&rsquo;n&rsquo;feel issues is a huge loss of potential sales.</p>
<p>Now, wether or not changing up the type face will cause those drops in visitors, I don&rsquo;t know. After all, I&rsquo;m just a software developer.</p>
<p>PS. While Bert Vanderveen is correct in that Swedish companies did trade with the Nazi regime, it does not mean that Sweden, swedes or even the companies that traded with the regime sympathized with the Nazis. In fact, Sweden always maintained a status of neutrality which means that Sweden neither supported nor abolished the regime. In hindsight, this may sometimes seem as a kind of support while in fact it&rsquo;s a condition of neutrality. The government couldn&rsquo;t disallow trade with the Nazis since it would effectively cancel the status of neutrality and place us as participants in the conflict. As you may or may not know, Sweden did not enter the conflict between Finland and Russia during that time for the very same reasons. Note that I&rsquo;m not taking a stand here, just trying to convey a more fair image than portraying Swedes as nazis.</p>

<p>As for Nazis and Sweden, and such issues, Sweden is nicely cushioned between Norway and Finland, so it&rsquo;s been relatively easy to stay neutral. I understand that it was better to co-operate that to be occupied. Norway was occupied by Germany and are with NATO now, something that&rsquo;s been discussed in Finland, too. Finns had to side with the Germans against Russians, but kicked them out later. Bit of a no-choice situation, to start with. 
Sweden took care of a lot of Finnish children during the war, which was a very good deed indeed.</p>

<p>Re. the AP piece, there are several errors in there, and the typophile reference seems to have been borrowed from the Time article. I bet 20 euros if IKEA ever reverts the font, the AP will lead with the headline “Back to the Futura!” Well at least the journalist’s name sounds like an IKEA product. :-)</p>

<p>Ikea has reacted to the unexpected coverage of this in Time magazine and throughout social media:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We&rsquo;re surprised. But I think it&rsquo;s mainly experts who have expressed their views, people who are interested in fonts. I don&rsquo;t think the broad public is that interested. Verdana is a simple, cost-effective font which works well in all media and languages.—Camilla Meiby, Ikea spokesman (quoted by Associated Press)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It’s sad that some people react negative. Still, we are very glad that people care so much. But what’s important is the message, not good looking fonts.—Ivana Hrdlickova, Ikea (quoted by Swedish Wire)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I really appreciate Ikea&rsquo;s intervention and their response. It shows an open mind and I really want to thank them for joining a conversation started by people who appreciate both their role in promoting design to masses, and design itself.</p>
<p>However, there are certain aspects that I would argue about:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ikea, you say you are glad that design/typography experts care about you. I think that&rsquo;s something few brands can brag about. This whole fuss is about nothing else than caring about your design strategy—a strategy that I (and other 3000+ fellow designers who signed the above mentioned petition) hope you will revise!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Something else occurred to me: if Ikea went with Verdana because of cost issues related to serving web fonts, why not commission a new series of Verdana fonts optically tweaked for use at large sizes and in the catalogs? The basic structure of Verdana would adapt well to reining the details that look out of proportion at larger sizes. Adding ink traps and enlarging counters in the bold weight would make it print better in the catalogs. Light and black weights would help the type distinguish itself in print and signage.</div>

<p>IKEA is certainty showing everyone who doesn&rsquo;t shop there how much their clients love design. Plus the brand is being spoken.</p>
<p>After this Verdana nightmare everyone will be happy to have futura back. And all non-Ikea-costumers will notice how good looking is ikea&rsquo;s Futura and their furnisher too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is the current situation but it could be. After all they must know something about design, or else they would have picked Comic Sans or Arial.</p>

There are several forums devoted to TV shows, video games, sporting teams, cars, bikes, (all of which I enjoy), and other things that are at least as insignificant as what we talk about. Why don&rsquo;t those forums have people joining to belittle forumgoers' passions?</p>
<p>Also, I should mention that this forum is pull of people who make their livings doing something related to this forum, which distinguishes us from forums about almost all of the above-mentioned areas of interest.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Incredible thread, so many good insights.</p>
<p>I myself fall on the side that is more intrigued by the move. Undoubtedly, choosing Verdana is a &ldquo;sign of the times,&rdquo; as it seems that it was very much dictated and necessitated by web technology. Where Futura had it&rsquo;s place in history to express geometric and streamlined modernity for the printing press, Verdana speaks to a whole different kind of &ldquo;digital modernity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of discounting the move as purely functional, I think it&rsquo;s time to reconsider Verdana as something that might work for Ikea because it&rsquo;s just what they need, regardless of not being designed for print, etc. I wonder: would people think it&rsquo;s as terrible if they didn&rsquo;t know where it came from?</p>

<p>This is just terrible thinking. Pure stupidity.</p>
<p>I have just read article about Ikea and Verdana in Croatian newspaper. Also Typophile was noted. Regarding our discussion we are going round and round in circles. Many of you said, and it&rsquo;s just technically righ and correct that Verdana was not made for print.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Why is anyone upset about this quote:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;But what’s important is the message, not good looking fonts.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->message<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the most important thing? Everything else is secondary. Concerning style, consistency is one of the most important things. This is especially true, as has been mentioned, when dealing with a global company that has to try to keep some kind of consistency across web and print in multiple languages.</p>
<p>Sometime in 2008, all Ikea websites moved from various fonts (mostly Arial) to Verdana, probably in preparation for this print move. From that alone, the sites looks better, but I don&rsquo;t remember any TIME articles about that. So lighten up about this!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in love with Verdana&rsquo;s numerals (especially the 1 and 9), but it&rsquo;s not as if it&rsquo;s so bad that it&rsquo;s distracting to me, and I think that&rsquo;s what it comes down to. Even if Verdana looks marginally worse than Futura in print, it&rsquo;s not so bad that I&ndash;much less the general public&ndash;will be distracted by it, or even notice it. Regardless of the font, the Ikea catalogs are well designed anyway. Even if [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/six_7_8/3854126727/in/set-72157622017139377/|this]] doesn&rsquo;t say Ikea to us yet, that&rsquo;ll change with time.</p>
<p>If Verdana really looks so bad at display sizes that it matters, then Ikea can simply commission a display cut for the different languages. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be necessary, but judging from what mstade said, this would make a lot more sense than the alternatives.</p>
<p>Anyway, for anyone who has not seen a catalog, here is another side-by-side comparison, just make sure you have your seatbelt on and your soapbox nearby:
<a href="http://www.idsgn.org/posts/ikea-says-goodbye-to-futura/">http://www.idsgn.org/posts/ikea-says-goodbye-to-futura/</a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote by macmcraeart on digg that pretty much sums it up for me:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->oh snap! they switched from plain to more plain&hellip; rage.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When you go too far with form over function, I think you lose sight of some other important things: like how typophile forum looks great (my first post btw), but I hate that there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;quote this/+quote&rdquo; buttons, comment numbers to reference, or highlight-and-click html-tagging buttons. Also, seeing as how so many people here are on a first name basis, wouldn&rsquo;t it make sense to have our real names displayed just under our aliases? All things neglected so that the site can look cleaner?</p>

<p>OT tangent: why is &ldquo;seatbelt&rdquo; not a word in my spellchecker yet? It&rsquo;s not even listed as &ldquo;seat-belt&rdquo; yet in the MW dictionary. Keeping apart a pair of words that naturally belong together is such a shame. Damn those segregationist!</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this response to the Blog&rsquo;s bold statement (from a former student):</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Re: mehallo</p>
<p>Thanks for noticing the post. However, I guess I should clarify, as it seems that some of the arguments may have been taken literally.</p>
<p>My thinking on the headline (which admittedly was a bit hyperbolic to make a point) is sort of rooted in this line from the article: &ldquo;It looks like the font blew out when the catalogs were being printed.&rdquo; I guess that&rsquo;s where I started from with that.</p>
<p>My point was that the font is so overused, that it&rsquo;s a given – it&rsquo;s almost as if it&rsquo;s not even there. I wasn&rsquo;t literally trying to say that it wasn&rsquo;t a font. I thought that should have been clear from the props I gave Matthew Carter in the post. Alas.</p>
<p>And regarding the CSS: Someone posted the question to me at Hacker News, and my response was (jokingly) that it&rsquo;s for computers that only have one font.</p>
<p>This whole debacle has been a fairly strange one. As the story went mainstream, it went from designers and techies largely agreeing with my points to non-designers hearing about the story and looking at it as a bottle of nerd rage in about three days. Currently waiting for the backlash against the backlash against the backlash to begin.</p>

<p>Yes of course a typeface is PART of the overall message, but what is important is the message. I think some people here think those things are on equal terms, or worse, instead of one thing contributing to the other. Also, I&rsquo;m reading &ldquo;message&rdquo; as meaning more than just words on a page.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For IKEA’s products the above statement would translate to:
What’s important is that you can sit on it, not what the chair looks like.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that absolutely, positively, 100% perfect then? Clearly Ikea doesn&rsquo;t design purely superficial stuff you might find in a stuffy boutique or art dealer. They&rsquo;re not going to PURPOSEFULLY make ugly chairs, but the IMPORTANT thing is that you can sit on the chair, not what it looks like (honestly, a few of their chairs ARE damn ugly, and I think we&rsquo;re now into the endless form vs function debate). Ikea&rsquo;s products are designed to be semi-modular, practical, and affordable. They&rsquo;re rarely on the cutting edge. They&rsquo;ve made a fortune selling bargain furniture that does its job and is &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;, why would anyone be surprised that they&rsquo;re going with what the spokesperson described as a &ldquo;more efficient and cost-effective&rdquo; font?</p>
<p>She did say they &ldquo;are very glad that [us angry typographer] people care so much&rdquo;, so the only thing wrong with the quote that I see is that maybe she slipped and said &ldquo;important&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;most important&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Where did I say their chairs aren&rsquo;t designed? Anyway, I&rsquo;ve seen giant spools being recycled/resold as tables, so what&rsquo;s to stop Ikea from selling boxes/crates/whatever as chairs/stools/benches/footrests? What makes something a chair?</p>
<p>Back on topic: Jan, I think you&rsquo;re going way overboard on this slippery slope stuff. The spokesperson clearly didn&rsquo;t mean that aesthetics are not important at all, only that they&rsquo;re subordinate to the message. It&rsquo;s a balancing act of time/money vs quality/effectiveness.</p>
<p>Aesthetics are always important to some degree when you&rsquo;re trying to sell a product&ndash;not just in the product, but in the message itself. But, Ikea clearly has priorities where other things matter before or along with aesthetics: price, flat-pack-ability, etc. But, nothing matters more than that you can get the message / sit on it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve traded one flavor of bland for another flavor of bland so that they can cut costs and be consistent across different languages. Tell them to make a display cut, not cry foul and sign petitions like it&rsquo;s some crime against humanity after one catalog.</p>
<p>-You&rsquo;re saying it&rsquo;s stupid to think Ikea can have a message without a pretty font since aesthetics is part of the overall message.
-I&rsquo;m saying that since aesthetics is part of the message, if you have an effective message, your aesthetics were either fine, or everything else in the message was so great that the aesthetics didn&rsquo;t matter much at all.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t take what people say literally word for word, which is why I wrote that she should have said the message is “most important” instead of “important” for clarity. I think I made the same mistake in my post. We all flub words.</p>
<p>I think I know why you can&rsquo;t understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say: this forum is set in 12pt Verdana! If only it were in Futura&hellip; :p</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s quite true, IKEA Intersystems owns the IKEA Sans, Script and Serif fonts used throughout the company. The switch to Verdana was to save money - stores paid to use the IKEA fonts. This makes little sense to those of us who work in the design departments at IKEA. That we pay for our own font useage on a font we already own seems suspect. But IKEA does not always make sense when it comes to decision making in their retail outlets. Recently they changed uniform standards to the yellow shirt for every worker in the store except the cafeteria staff. This was to showcase a larger sales presence at a time when sales were slumping and they&rsquo;re cutting back the sales staff to less than 20 hours a week and eliminating middle management positions. Now we have designer co-workers who once wore inconspicuous white t-shirts as well as logistics and maintenance co-workers (who wore blue) in the iconic yellow polos. Mind you, not a single one of us is actually trained in sales, and these departments work on a regular schedule. So, for appearance sake, now during regular operating hours stores look full of sales workers, most of whom have to refer customers to &ldquo;a person wearing yellow who works in sales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Add to that, the switch to Verdana has to cost the company millions of dollars - money better spent elsewhere (we&rsquo;re not getting bonuses this year). We have to re-print every single price tag, banner and rack label in each store. There are new letterheads and business cards for every manager to pay for. We aim to go green on a corporate level yet reams and reams of paper is required for the simplest of switches within a store. We have hundreds of stores!</p>
<p>Then again, in my years at IKEA I have found it to be a very confusing company. On one hand, our store rakes in a quarter million dollars on weekdays. Double that on weekends. Yet there are more times than not that policies we hear about make it seem like the company is operating on a whim. Not to mention, every time we get a new country president we are mandated to make the aesthetic changes he or she deems are important - on a personal level, not based in sales. We make change and hope the sales follow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>

IKEA&rsquo;s brand has very little to do with &ldquo;design&rdquo; and everything to do with exuding affordability and pragmatic, if temporary, solutions.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Reducing costs is a returning argument in the choice for Verdana. But it should be obvious to anyone who has a basic grasp on how typography works that this is a blatant misunderstanding.</p>
<p>A simple test shows that Verdana is not only inadequate for print, has questionable readbility off-line, but it also runs very uneconomically. It takes at least 10-20% extra space compared to its predecessor Futura.</p>
<p>Considering Ikea produces tens of millions of pages of print and unthinkable advertising inches worldwide, it is clear this will cost a lot of extra money if copywriters are not instructed to lose more than 20% of their copy from now on.</p>
<p>I my view the choice for Verdana is typographically unsound aswell as economically stupid, but also questionable from an environmental standpoint.</p>

<p>in•teg•ri•ty [ in téggrətee ]</p>

<p>Definition:</p>

<p>possession of firm principles: the quality of possessing and steadfastly adhering to high moral principles or professional standards</p>

<li>
<p>completeness: the state of being complete or undivided (formal) the territorial integrity of the nation</p>

<p>Verdana does an excellent job of working perfectly in the environment for which it was designed. It solves the design problem of readable text on screen quite well. In so doing, there had to be compromises made in the areas of print text and display. To me, therefore, it has great integrity. It does EXACTLY what it was asked to do. Think of it like Braille.  It works for those who are unsighted and know how to read it but is pretty lousy as a print text for the sighted non-Braille reader.</p>

So I&rsquo;m delighted that Ascender is extending the family. However the semantics of &ldquo;availability&rdquo; are important based on distribution. If the extended family is a commercial release for a fee, which seems certain, it won&rsquo;t be fully available on the client/receiver side.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There was an enjoyable radio programme called Aristoteleen kantapää on the Finnish YLE Radio 1 yesterday, where typography in general and its importance for reading was discussed and the local typography guru, designer, teacher and writer Markus Itkonen interviewed. It was part of a long running series that concentrates on Finnish language and its uses, phrases etc. Since the subject was introduced with the IKEA case, my guess is that typography got this rare mention because of the fuss. The presenter talked about Verdana and Futura, their history and designers, why Verdana is called Verdana etc before moving to more general approach, including a brief history of type and the difference between serif and sans.</p>

<p>I think I hear what you&rsquo;re saying, but on the other &lsquo;extreme&rsquo;, if a font has a fee, it does not prevent the font from being &lsquo;fully available on the client/receiver side&rsquo; for web use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without EOT, @font-face, or some universal solution to distribution it won’t have the impact that it should.</p>

<p>@font-face is the current most advanced universal solution to provide font fidelity for web design and web use, but I think it is intended for the opposite of distribution unless you mean distribution of processing.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Me neither.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The model of putting the fonts on every personal computer, if not dying, is leaving either horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>Those CT fonts wouldn&rsquo;t work for IKEA or most other mega media companies, though I encourage you to try. They are not agates, they look very particular at large sizes and are not easy matches, size-independantly, with the limited number of Asian fonts that are also &ldquo;web safe&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And, I would call choosing Verdana for all corporate communications IKEAcheap/Web safe, an important difference, just to be word safe. ;) The only thing IKEA could be missing is serving, but they are not able to count entirely on installed fonts either, Are they?</p>

<p>&hellip;that&rsquo;s a dying model, isn&rsquo;t it? The new model is to &lsquo;serve&rsquo; fonts &lsquo;for free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No kidding&hellip;I just got back from the How In-HOWse Design Conference. At my table there was a nice gentleman from Ikea. We introduced ourselves and I said something to the effect of them being the topic du jour amongst designers. Turns out that this man, was THE gentleman that made &ldquo;the Verdana decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gotta respect him for sticking to his guns, but I did tell him that as a type nerd he was never gonna win me over. :)</p>
<p>His reasons made sense from a business perspective—I think sometimes how your brand is &ldquo;perceived&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t sink in until after you&rsquo;ve made a drastic change.</p>

&ldquo;Our latest Please Explain is all about typefaces and typography. Typeface designer Jonathan Hoefler, type designer and president of Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones and Steven Heller, co-chair of the MFA Designer as Author program at the School of Visual Arts and author of the VISUALS column for the New York Times Book Review, will explain how typefaces are created and why typography is important to communication and design.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out, in the context of this wide-ranging discussion, that Matthew Carter and David Berlow <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --> working on extending the Verdana (and Georgia) type family, under the auspices of Ascender Corp. Though not, so far, in the direction of specifically &ldquo;display&rdquo; versions. The new weights &amp; widths should, at least, give a little more flexibility to designers using these type families, whether at Ikea or anywhere else.</p>
<p>By the way, I confess that I don&rsquo;t see any particular resemblance between Verdana and Frutiger. Or at least no more resemblance than you&rsquo;d find between various old-style serif romans, or certain chancery italics.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. And yes I was referring to @font-face as a means of “distribution of processing”. Are you saying that @font-face is what will make the new Verdana and Georgia fully available? My previous comment was based on @font-face not being fully implemented yet. However based on the Berlow and Daniels comments I think I see where this is headed and see much more potential than I had.</p>

<p>Well, those faces up to now have been available where MS wants them available, which seems to be the Mac and Windows. Ascender&rsquo;s license with MS makes them available to anyone willing to license them for &lsquo;normal&rsquo; desktop distribution, and the latest efforts are intended to make them much more available for web serving.</p>
<p>To clarify John Berry&rsquo;s statement slightly, the Verdana &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; versions e.g., (the current name of the new series), are not specifically made in the direction of “display” versions. However, the blacker and weightier condensed styles are being prepared somewhat independent of their appearance as text faces, which is different from the originals as far as I know.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok I saw this post a while back. I think this is sad that they are switching to accommodate a default font. Seriously, a logo is supposed to be an identity mark and switching to a default logo is making a statement. In my opinion, this is so microsoft works. Its an amateur move and really show bad on IKEAs creative thinking aspects.
So this move is bad.</div>
