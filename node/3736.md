body: Hello Everyone, <BR> <BR>I have a font which is slightly too light for laser
  printer use and I&#39;m trying to darken it just a tad using FontLab&#39;s Transform
  Bold/Outline feature.  Is it best to keep the same values for both horizontal weight
  and vertical weight or should I just do 1 or 2 units of horizontal and keep the
  vertical at 0?  I&#39;d like to preserve the original proportions as much as possible.  Thanks
  for any help.
