  scene a hacker writes \"Think on your sins\". Luckyly the internet has screenshots
  of it and i could mess around alittle. All font-recognition tools i have tried could
  not get me the right font. The closest match so far: \"Ne Saber Rund Bold\". But
  the \"S\" and \"I\" are different.\r\n\r\n<em>Original:</em>\r\n<img src=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdbgruXHVC1qibeuvo1_500.jpg\"/>\r\n\r\n<em>Rendered

  for the help in advance."

    letters then i thought):\r\nhttp://youtu.be/R9QswYg5xKk\r\n\r\nMore similar fonts
    (maybe combination of all fonts? can it be?):\r\n- Automate Bold (\"B\" and \"I\")\r\n-
    Telepod Two SG Medium (\"N\" is good)\r\n\r\nI would add the cropped font pictures
    but i don't know how to edit my post + found a typo: \"luckily\".\r\n\r\n"
