  one issue though, I can't login or post via Lynx, which is really too bad.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  else use Lynx? I think it's nice because all of the superfluous images that the
  web throws at you are gone. Instead, what is left is nice, clean text for reading.\r\n\r\nGood
  stuff."

  body: "I often use Lynx in dump mode to get some clean input. For instance, on my
    Linux server, if I type\r\n<code>\r\nlynx -dump \"http://www.antonchehov.ru/book/149/\"
    > dama.txt\r\n</code>\r\nI get a rather clean unicode text file containing Chekhov's
    \u0414\u0430\u043C\u0430 \u0441 \u0441\u043E\u0431\u0430\u0447\u043A\u043E\u0439
    in Russian.\r\n\r\nMichel"

    pipe lynx outputs into sed and awk to extract useful info and generate .tex files."

  body: "I\u2019ve been using Lynx essentially every day for the last dozen years.
    Typophile has a lot of unnecessary examples of standards noncompliance, and the
    login screen is one of them. It appears to require JavaScript or something, which
    is quite unnecessary. Also, the content area is entirely inside a Flash movie,
    also quite unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIt borders on impossible to have a conversation
    about Web standards on this site without either being ignored or being told that
    it works fine in IE6, so I\u2019ve long since given up.\r\n\r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe

    which is good, because that means things are working properly. But it's not a
    configuration problem on my end, which is bad, meaning I can't fix it myself.\r\n\r\n"
