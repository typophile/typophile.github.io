  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Though I've been a lurker, this is my first real post.  <BR> <BR>I read an earlier post about a &quot;scammish&quot; online certificate. What about the real deal? I've seen a lot of info on Visual Communications programs. What do you think?  <BR> <BR>Here's my situation:  I have 129 credit hours that somehow never added up to a degree. I was offered a killer marketing job that I couldn't pass up and pledged to finish my degree in advisertising at a local college. Well, five years and much success later, I never finished. I've managed to do very well professionally without the degree, but would like it for my own personal satisfaction. Honestly, most of my peers have no idea I don't have a degree &ndash; it's unlikely that someone without one would have my job (I've been lucky, I guess). Anyway, the program I'm looking into is a B.S. and is accredited by the same place as several art schools.  Everything seems legit. Thoughts?  <BR> <BR>P.S. I can't stand the thought of stepping foot on an actual campus, so please don't let that suggestion override your response.</div>

  
   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">Look at the accrediting body itself. That's what makes it legit. Then look at the other schools they've accredited and how they're rated against name schools like Parsons, RISD, etc. The schools don't have to be first tier, but should be recognized by the profession. It would help if you could get some advice from a reputable grad program, would they accept the online certificate or not? It doesn't matter if you're going to grad school or not, it's just a way of getting a handle on how people view the online program. <BR> <BR>If you have 129 hours you should have gotten a degree, so I assume you weren't anywhere long enough to earn one. Most brick and mortar schools require residency in the program before granting a degree so you would be stuck doing another year at a minimum, maybe two. Not fair, but that's the system.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Talk with your local tech school. Often they'll grant you credits for previously earned ones and they often have distance learning options (online). <BR> <BR>So if it's for personal satisfaction, then that'd be fine. <BR> <BR>If it's to improve your resume, alas, at least in this industry, the name of the school is rather important, and I don't think any online art school has the same cachet as a brick and mortar would.</div>
