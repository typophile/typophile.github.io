    based on linguistic frequencies of letter-pairs &#40;or even triplets&#41;. <BR>

  body: 'Basically, there is no &#34;complete listing&#34;: you can take it as far
    as you want to. The ct, st, and sp for example are not in use anymore because,
    due to changing in tastes, most people today find them disruptive in the flow
    of reading. The sz has been thrown out of modern German, and I haven&#39;t seen
    many examples using the ft and fft-ligatures in Petr van Blokland&#39;s Proforma
    yet. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try to post a couple of examples later on.'

    the one that just happened&#41;, and it had some amazing ligatures &#40;in fact
    more like conflations of letters&#41;, but I forget what it was called &#40;I
    don&#39;t think it&#39;s been released&#41;, and don&#39;t know where to point
    to, but I do remember it was by a French designer. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    &#34;clashing characters&#34;. For example, what&#39;s the use of making <b>fl</b>
    if you don&#39;t include <b>fb</b>, <b>fh</b> etc. Really, now the technical constraints
    are gone, it&#39;s all up to you.'
