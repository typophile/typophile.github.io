body: "So surely everyone has seen by now [[Ina Saltz]]'s lovely new book of typographic
  tattoos, Body Type?\r\n\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/yzphd6\r\n\r\nI thought that I would
  take the opportunity to finally get some sort of permanent homage to my love of
  letterforms on an upcoming trip overseas, where I already have an appointment booked
  with one of the fine artists that is featured in the book. \r\n\r\nOnly problem
  being, I have no idea what to get.\r\n\r\nFor something as permanent as a tattoo,
  this seems like a bigger problem than it actually is. Most of my other ink is coded
  in some type of personal symbolism, but for this piece, I am just looking for something
  a bit more objective to express my feelings for type and graphic design in the boldest,
  most simple way possible. \r\n\r\nI was originally going to do an armband featuring
  the entire roman alphabet with each letter from a different typeface starting with
  that letter, but after I started sketching it out, it started to look a bit like
  a dogs breakfast. Which finds me back at square one. \r\n\r\nSome other ideas I
  have been tossing around have been things like: Decorated Initials/Drop Caps, a
  woodcut illustration showing the process of casting metal type, the outline of a
  california job case laid over a cmyk circle overprint thingy, a panel of Chris Ware
  (which would compliment my Adrian Tomine piece quite nicely), a square containing
  a simple pangram, etc. At one point I thought that getting trajans column around
  my forearm would be pretty funny...\r\n\r\nI could of course wait until something
  strikes me, but I really dont want to lose this opportunity with this typographically
  skilled artist. (I am located in Australia, and only go overseas about once a year...)
  I have a bit of time booked too, so can afford to do something a bit more detailed.
  \r\n\r\nFor some reason when a project like this is so personal, it becomes almost
  impossible to find what you are looking for, so I thought I would put this to the
  typo-hive mind, and give you the opportunity to literally leave your mark on a fellow
  designer. \r\n\r\nWould love to hear anyones thoughts, suggestions, or directions.
  Or share some pics of your own ink!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJ\r\n"

  body: I recently faced a similar problem... and ended up getting inked (last weekend
    whilst I was visiting Den Haag) with a geometric design that I had doodled many,
    many years ago. So, effectively, I went for a custom sort instead of a standard
    lettersort :-)
