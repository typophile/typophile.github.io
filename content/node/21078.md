  body: I think your first logotype is the stand out one for me, if the fancy tales
    on the 'd', 'p', 'n', and the last 'e' were removed. As I believe the ligatures
    on the 'gi' and 'se' would be enough to add the elegance to the logotype and not
    look as if the them was being over used. I hope this helps in someway.

  body: I think the 4th is quite strong. I really enjoy how the letters, at first,
    look like abstract swashes. I could see that being taken in many different directions.

  body: "I'm with Tiffany the fourth one needs some work on it, like the verticals
    having a similar stress and more exuberance in the flourishes, have you looked
    at the curly braces } to provide inspiration? You could maybe make a reflection
    of the monogram to further abstract the letters.\r\nTim"
