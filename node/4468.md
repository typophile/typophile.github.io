body: Hello to all members. <BR>My first post here. Discovered this forum just a week
  ago and I&#39;m already hooked to it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been asked to design a magazine
  for a local newspaper. The content of this special issue will be about companies
  that have succeeded in business through the added value of design in their products.
  &#40;Mainly industrial design, but also graphic, packaging, etc&#41; <BR>My intention
  is to show also that the use of good typography can improve a lot the readability
  and the user experience. <BR>I need a good combination of fonts for body text and
  headlines. Till now I&#39;ve been using Rotis Semiserif for headlines and Univers
  Condensed for body text &#40;I know is a bit weird but they give me always a LOT
  of text to fit in every page, and is the only way to deal with that&#41; <BR>I don&#39;t
  want to do like other &#34;design&#34; magazines that put unreadable microtext in
  futuristic fonts. I want to use some modern looking fonts but they must be readable...
  and affordable for a small studio too :-&#41;  so please don&#39;t say the one that
  I&#39;d love to try but I cannot afford. <BR>If I find a nice combination that reflects
  this, it&#39;s even possible that we can write an article explaining that to illustrate
  the whole process. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for your kind answers, <BR>Vicente

  body: Nice icon. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s great that you&#39;re concerned a lot with readability,
    but remember that this special issue is specifically about Design - so I think
    your display font at least should be &#34;self-conscious&#34; in this respect.
    The trick will be finding a text font that has &#34;attitude&#34; but remains
    very readable. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m partial to wedge-serif fonts, and the other day
    I saw a magazine cover using Alias&#39;s Key really well. For a text companion
    to that you could choose a bunch of things, like Swift or FF Olson. Whitman might
    be nice too although I think it&#39;s a bit too &#34;soft-spoken&#34; for this,
    I think. <BR> <BR>BTW, narrowness isn&#39;t always more economical, because a
    wider font can be set smaller while looking the same size as a larger narrow font.
    It depends a lot on your column width and frequency of linebreaks. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Thanks for the info Hrant! <BR> <BR>Finally found Key in Veers webpage. Seems
    a nice choice, only concern would be about its width. Do you think it can be a
    problem? <BR> <BR>Swift it&#39;s a nice font. But too expensive for this project
    and maybe I&#39;d never take real benefit of it &#40;Hey, I&#39;m sure that it
    deserves its price&#41;. <BR> <BR>Following the style you suggested, I discovered
    Corel&#39;s Humanist 712 Slabserif BT in my vault. Do you think that can substitute
    Olsen? Or maybe it loses the &#34;swifted&#34; serifs that make Olsen better for
    this application? <BR> <BR>All the best <BR>Vicente <BR> <BR> <BR>PS Any chance
    you send me a scan of this cover magazine, so we can get inspired for using Key
    typeface?

    problem sometimes - but I have virtually no experience <i>using</i> fonts so I&#39;m
    not sure. Maybe James &#40;Montalbano&#41; can help. <BR> <BR>&#62;  Humanist
    712 <BR> <BR>That might be a good compromise, although it&#39;s kind of a &#34;hybrid&#34;
    slab. Some people might feel its retro vibe, but that can be good too these days.
    But anyway, don&#39;t choose a slab/wedge font because <i><b>I</b></i> like it.
    If you decide to go with Key however it does make sense. <BR> <BR>&#62; send me
    a scan <BR> <BR>Hey, I try to limit my purchase of magazines that I&#39;m <i>interested</i>
    in, much less something that just has a nice cover! :-&#41;  But I&#39;ll try
    to find what magazine it was so you can track it down. I do remember that Key
    was used to set the name of the magazine, and it was a short name, with a &#34;k&#34;
    in it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>The interior uses predominantly FF Olsen &#40;along with FF Meta&#41;.
    The title looks like a slightly customized version of Olsen Bold -- wider and

  body: Thanks! <BR>Wow, I was way off. It&#39;s funny that I was thinking of Olsen
    too though. <BR> <BR>I really like the mods they did for the title - especially
    the removal of that trap in the &#34;b&#34; &#40;although it&#39;s strange that
    there wasn&#39;t one on the &#34;k&#34; too&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW, considering you
    said you don&#39;t exercise, I assume you collect magazines then? :-&#41;  Or
    maybe you just like bikes &#40;like Gill with his trains&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    I just did a round recently. That&#39;s how I happen to have the recent issues

  body: Hi again Hrant &amp; Ken <BR>Thanks for all your suggestions. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re
    finally going for FF Olsen for main text. <BR>Think it will be our base font for
    some time. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t convince the client to spend
    more money in a display face &#40;Key&#41; so I&#39;ll look alternatives in my
    font vault, although i seem to have a lot of grunge freefonts not very suitable
    for that. <BR> <BR>Do you think it&#39;ll be possible to get a PDF sample of bulk
    text in FF Olsen 9-10 pt to show to the client before buying it? <BR>FonFont doesn&#39;t
    seem to provide it :-&#40; and MyFonts.com doesn&#39;t sell it yet. <BR> <BR>Vicente

  body: 'Since I&#39;m a certified wedge-serif freak, I contacted Morten back in December
    for a PDF of FF Olsen. At that time he said he was working on one - I haven&#39;t
    followed up. But my inquiry was &#34;academic&#34; in nature; if you dangled a
    potential sale in front of him it might make a difference...  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>You
    can send him an email through his Typophile profile: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view_profile&amp;profile=morten-users"
    target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view_profile&amp;profile=morten-users</a>
    <BR>If that doesn&#39;t work let me know. And if he does provide a &#34;sharable&#34;
    PDF, I&#39;d like to see it too. <BR> <BR>BTW, it looks like some weights of Olsen
    will work fine for display as well. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    if that&#39;s still a concern.
