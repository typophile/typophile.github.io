  process of getting it out the door, we have noticed two places where changes we
  made reverted to their old versions, in one case the version it reverted to was
  weeks old. I know that this is not just my memory playing tricks on me because we
  confirmed it by going back and looking at printouts, and the printouts were fine,
  but at some point the content changed even though nobody was working on those pages.
  \r\n\r\nHas anyone else seen this happening?"

    affects things on pages that one isn't looking at, and can result in unseen reversions
    if one is not careful. But a reversion to something weeks-old would not be explained
    by that."

  body: I once had problems with the line breaks when we began the book layout in
    Indesign CS3 and updated then to CS4, some parts had different line breaks in
    CS4. Another case was when I worked with the book function, I copied the Indesign
    documents on my laptop, started this files but I was still connected with the
    server. As soon as I used the book function the documents were saved again on
    the server, it took me quite a while until I realized this.

    bridge and if there are multiple files on the drive named 'document.indd', revisions
    and edits and whatnot ... if there's an application error and it has to recover
    or start again at what it thinks is the correct version of 'document.indd' that
    it pulls from the wrong place, you can have those things jump up and bite you.
    especially since the last few edits on anything are small punctuation changes,
    a factchecking clarification or subtle design adjustments. \r\n\r\ni'd recommend
    taking on a naming convention where you have the day's date at the end. 'document102009.indd'
    so if you have to recover or compare it, you don't have to go on an archaeological
    expedition to see the differences.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of unbridled creativity,\r\n\r\nTroy

    in CS4. </cite>\r\n\r\nJust FYI, that's not a bug -- it's documented. The line
    breaking algorithm is revised for CS4, as the older versions (at least going back
    to CS) tended to kick out the last single word or syllable, leaving this more
    often on a last line than statistically likely.\r\n\r\nThe new line breaking routines
    are only applied to stories that are actually edited in CS4; if you don't edit
    something, it'll remain the same (and if you <em>do</em> edit something, the line
    breaks will be better!).\r\n\r\nWhenever and whereever possible, I refrain from
    upgrading software across documents."
