  the dots font is not matching, the linebase is different.\r\nThis happen in Photoshop

  fonts, also the TrueType specific ones. I tried in OTF and TTf, nothing works.\r\n\r\nNow
  is the weirdest thing I ever seen.\r\nIf I draw a box with the caps height in the
  letter \xABd\xBB the font will match the line spacing. Only happen with \xABd\xBB
  glyph. The dot font have only dots and little square inside the caps height and
  baseline space.\r\n\r\nI also tried filling all the character set with my letters.
  It works always, excepting when i put the centered dot in \xABd\xBB glyph.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anybody knows the origin of this problem and how to solve it?\r\n\r\nPD: The strange
  thing with the \xABd\xBB makes me think I'm completely crazy.\r\n"

    did that \xABdirty\xBB solution: Put a little square a the top and it worked.\r\nI
    have to see what is the minimum thing I can put there. I tried a dot but it didn't
    work. Maybe a line or a 2x2 square?\r\nThanks for this info."

  body: "<cite>Maybe a line or a 2x2 square?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe smallest possible closed
    (!) contour consists of three overlaying (!) nodes. But even that is displayed
    in Photoshop as from a font size of round about 110 pixel.\r\n\r\nYou have the
    following alternatives:\r\n\r\n1. You ignore the problem, because it is not a
    bug in your font, and provide a warning information in the manual of the font.\r\n\r\n2.
    You provide an OpenType layout feature, which replaces the d by a d without aligner
    and which is applied by default. Disadvantage: That does not work in all programs.\r\n\r\n3.
    \ I did not try it and cannot exclude negative side effects / error in reasoning:
    The d of the font without aligner (font A) may hide the aligner of the other font
    (B), if the aligner is exactly placed with the coordinates of the highest point
    of the d of A in B. In this case you had to provide an info in the manual, that
    the user has to use A above B.\r\n\r\nEdited: Does not work in case of your two
    fonts, because the font with the dots is intended to overlay the font without
    dots.\r\n\r\n4. I did not try it and cannot exclude negative side effects / error
    in reasoning: You place the aligner horizontally very far away from the outline
    of the d (left side) and give the d a corresponding negative left side bearing.
    This would require short lines, because the bbox (or character) width cannot be
    bigger as a certain size (4000 units?), which I actually don\u2019t remember.\r\n\r\n5.
    You provide a third font, that covers the aligner. That font is always on the
    top of the other two text layers and the text color must be the same as the color
    of the bottom text layer. That font could (and should!) only contain the aligner
    and space characters (same width and kerning as in the other two fonts), because
    otherwise the anti-aliasing would be doubled or you have a problem with half transparent
    layers. And you had to add an information to the manual of the font.\r\n\r\nBut
    note, that users often don\u2019t read manuals. I think, I would go with alternative
    1."
