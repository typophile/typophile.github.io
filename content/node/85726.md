body: "Good afternoon type freaks.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create a character style or
  custom glyph that will let me easily insert a black circle/bullet containing a white
  text into my InDesign document. I need to have 3 different versions, each with their
  own respective letters (M, C, E) and colours.\r\n\r\nI first tried using paragraph
  rules and a custom stroke with rounded ends. I managed to make a circle around the
  letter, but positioning was not working.\r\n\r\nI'm also thinking a circle shape
  with text inside, then save as object style? \r\n\r\nAny tips would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks! "

    to be able to simply type the circles in, so that they behave like other text
    elements and flow with copy.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Joseph\r\n\r\nYou can set this quite easily with two adjacent characters
    in the same text frame; the first one is the black circle/bullet \u2013 try 'L'
    in Zapf Dingbats. The second one is the M, C, or E in whatever font you like (I
    tried Myriad), sized slightly smaller, coloured white and baseline shifted by
    a small increment \u2013 maybe half a point. Position the text cursor between
    the two, and either key shift-option-left arrow or enter a large negative value
    in the kerning field in the control palette (about -500). The second character
    will kern right back over the top of the first one. \r\n\r\nI doubt you could
    define these two together as a character style, but you can certainly select them
    both, copy and paste them wherever you like. Alternatively you could create outlines
    from these characters, group them together, select, copy and paste as an inline
    graphic into any text frames. "

  body: Following the idea above, you could create a style for the circle, a style
    for the character, and use nested styles to make one paragraph style that would
    accomplish both. You could then paste this as an in-line text frame with an object
    style that contains the paragraph style. Does that make sense?

  body: Ben, I think your approach has a lot of merit, although I don't have time
    to test it right now. With a paragraph style that uses nested character styles
    you could control the attributes of the circle and letter separately to achieve
    the desired effect.

    frame is needed.

    be trying it out shortly. I'll need to explore inline graphics a bit as I rarely
    use them.\r\n\r\nJoshua, funny you mentioned nested styles, as I was just watching
    a tutorial on the subject today by Nigel French. Currently I can grasp the concept
    of nested styles and use them for very basic applications, unfortunately what
    you suggested is over my head! Hopefully it will all make sense soon. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJ\r\n"
