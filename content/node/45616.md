    really not the best place to ask this type of question, as this forum is for typography,
    so I'm unsure how you came to be here.\r\n\r\nJH"

    be a tube. Valves are a bit delicate. You could check the bias, but I wouldn't
    open the back unless you know your way around.\r\n\r\nTake it to a shop and consider
    it an opportunity to possibly try some new glass. There are a wide selection of
    EL-34s out there, so try something new.\r\n\r\nhttp://thetubestore.com/el34review.html"

    have tube preamps with solid state power amps. \r\n\r\nYou're probably going to
    have to bring it to a repair shop."

  body: "First of all, of course one of the tubes in your amp is f***d up. \r\nSecond,
    I'm truely surprised by the fact that you own a tube amp without even knowing
    it. That's quite a waste imho.\r\nThird, call your \"friend\" and ask him some
    money to fix your amp. And don't give out your amp to anyone in the near future.\r\nFourth,
    this is a TYPOGRAPHY forum. If you have any question regarding the typeface of
    the Marshall logo, you're welcome, otherwise... Try to use Internet a little bit
    more wisely than your musical equipment.\r\n\r\ndr"
