  a certain type of sans serif. But is this really a reference to the renaissance
  Humanist scribe hands? If so why is the term not used for serifed typefaces that
  are directly related to this humanist hand?\r\nDoes anyone know when the history
  of when term was first 'coined' in regards to sans serif. Was it just an attempt
  to categorise, or maybe a commercial reason, to set a typeface design as different
  from the rest by giving it an saleable tag, one that gave it a mystique, esteem
  or historical cogitation.\r\nHumanism also has many non-typographic meanings. What
  does this tag imply to you as  designers?"

  body: Loosely speaking, I think humanistic is the opposite of geometric. In a humanist
    font, the curves were not created using a rule, square and compasses but with
    a 'free' hand (as per the scribe hands that you mention). Of course, beziers and
    quadratic splines are hardly humanistic but are now used to create most fonts
    so I guess its now purely an appearance thing rather than how the font was actually
    made. When I think archetypal Humanist, I think Frutiger. I couldn't tell you
    if the tag was being used before that though. Maybe 'humanist' is a catch all
    for sans serifs that just don't fit into the grotesk or geometric category. Happy
    to be put straight.

    Eliason]]. He gave a presentation of his research so far at last year's [[http://www.typecon.com|TypeCon]].
    \r\n\r\nFrom the conference description:\r\n\r\n<cite>This presentation traces
    the twentieth-century emergence of the term \u201Chumanist\u201D as a classification
    of types. \u201CHumanist\u201D has been commonly applied to many (in some cases,
    rather different) typefaces. How and why has \u201Chumanist\u201D persisted as
    a label? Craig Eliason\u2019s presentation argues that the term emerged in the
    context of a surge of interest in the Italian Renaissance among Western historians,
    and that this interest, in turn, was fed by a sense of crisis of civilization
    coming from the turbulent political and cultural history of the mid-twentieth-century.</cite>\r\n\r\nIf
    you're lucky, Craig will stop by this thread to share some of his knowledge."

  body: "I'm a bit surprised people haven't heard the term used for serif faces. Maybe
    it's because of my interest in serif faces in general, or maybe it's the particular
    terminology used in the type classification I first learned from, but when I hear
    the term \"humanist\" in connection with type, I always think of serif faces first.\r\n\r\nI
    know exactly what a humanist serif is; I refer you to the [[http://ilovetypography.com/2007/11/06/type-terminology-humanist-2/|I
    Love Typography article]]. By contrast, I'm still not quite sure what is meant
    by a humanist sans. I can see that sans designs obviously based on oldstyle forms
    are humanist, but I hesitate when I see something like Frutiger, even though I've
    often heard it refered to as a humanist design.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the use
    of the term for sans designs is not necessarily connected with humanist serif
    faces. Perhaps all that is meant is that the shapes are not constructed as in
    geometric sans or grotesques, but have a \"human\" touch.\r\n\r\nTo add another
    wrinkle, I sometimes use \"humanist\" to describe a much larger category of type
    including most Latin serif faces used for text today (humanist, oldstyle, transitional,
    modern, etc.) that is based on the first humanist forms, as opposed to something
    like blackletter. I don't know how appropriate this use is."

  body: "I agree with you Jong, logically humanist should refer to serif faces, however
    if you go to a font website and search for humanist I am sure that 90% of the
    returned fonts will be sans. There also seems to be a flood of new sans serifs
    at the moment, most of which claim to have humanist 'touches'. I wonder if perhaps
    it has become a cool buzzword that is used to sell new fonts? Or maybe the humanist
    sans is more versatile (than grotesque & geometric) and therefore more in demand?\r\n\r\nBy
    the way does anyone know if it's possible to get a copy of Craig Eliason's presentation?

  body: "Here is a thread on this topic that Craig started a few years ago:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typophile.com/node/35213]]\r\n\r\nI
    looked up \"humanist\" on MyFonts, and the first several results were the Bitstream
    fonts, like Humanist 521 (Gill Sans), Humanist 531 (Syntax), Humanist 777 (Frutiger),
    and Humanist 970 (Doric). It may be Bitstream that popularized the use of the
    term for non-geometric, non-grotesque sans designs. Bitstream uses \"Venetian\"
    for humanist serifs, as in Venetian 301 (Centaur). The availability of this alternative
    and unambiguous term for humanist serifs probably contributed to the semantic
    shift of \"humanist\" to cover sans designs primarily."

  body: "Here I am. I think many of the suspicions that have been put forward in the
    thread already are sound.\r\n\r\nI think the arrival of new sans designs around
    the turn of the 1960s (Optima and Pascal within the subcategory, Helvetica and
    Univers outside of it) were what provoked a more official sorting out of sans
    types and the consequent invention of the \"humanist sans\" label.\r\n\r\nThe
    earliest published use of the term I have traced so far is the British Standards
    Institution guide to type nomenclature and classification that was published in
    1967. (Thus this predates Syntax, which was proposed in my earlier thread as a
    possible first.) If anyone finds anything earlier please let me know!\r\n\r\nOne
    interesting bit I found from my research (which I didn't have time to go into
    at TypeCon) is that all of the labels in the influential type classification scheme
    of Maximilien Vox from the 1950s were intentially \"suggestive\" neologisms. Terms
    like \"Garaldes\" and \"Didones\" were unchanged in English publications of the
    scheme, so retained their invented character. But \"humanes\" (which suggests
    but is not a word in French - I'd welcome correction from anybody who knows French
    better than I) was turned into \"humanist\" in most English accounts. To be true
    to Vox's intentions, perhaps we should be saying \"humanic\" instead of \"humanist\"
    (as one or two sources I've seen have done). "

  body: ">Although the name does make sense considering the influences that conceived

    is spot on. No word can be defined absent context. For example, in Adobe's commercial
    literature, the word 'humanist' is seldom used without being preceded by the word
    'warm'. What warmth has got to do with type classification, I don't know. But
    I do know it's got a lot to do with marketing and propaganda -- and fuzziness;
    and fuzzy thinking. \r\nFor example, while Robert Slimbach often describes his
    'humanist sans' designs as 'warm', he describes his humanist serif typeface Minion
    as 'cool'. Oops! Did I say 'his' humanist sans designs? I meant Frutiger's and
    K\xFCster's. It's important to be accurate in a discussion like this, where we're
    trying to cut through the commercial fluff.\r\n\r\nJust for the record, two definitions
    from the OED:\r\n\r\nhumanist, noun: Literary Hist. One of the scholars who, at
    the Revival of Learning in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries,
    devoted themselves to the study of the language, literature, and antiquities of
    Rome, and afterwards of Greece; hence, applied to later disciples of the same
    culture.\r\n\r\nhumanistic, adjective: Pertaining to or characteristic of the
    humanists or classical scholars of the Renascence; classical.\r\n\r\nN.B. There
    are several other OED definitions of these terms."

  body: "Craig, perhaps you can clarify something for me? \r\n\r\nIs BSI 1967 the
    first English reference to a humanist typeface? (This is brutal for a start; as
    we have seen, humanist should be the noun, and humanistic the adjective.)\r\n\r\nIs
    the first non-English reference Vox's humanes? This appears to be an illegitimate
    Latin coinage. Was it not translated earlier than 1967? I don't see why Vox should
    be given any particular weight. 'Garalde' is both ugly and silly and to a non-typographer
    looks like a funny way to spell 'Gerald' - - while one of many previous terms
    with a long history, Aldine, does just as well. Not the least problem with 'humanes'
    is that there is no way to learn what it meant without interrogating the presumably
    now extinct Herr Vox. That is not the way a word's pedigree should work. \r\n\r\n.
    . . . . \r\n\r\nReading about the 1933 Humanist Manifesto and the current 'Humanists'
    reveals that the current common definition of 'Humanist' seems to be someone who
    is non-religious but nice --- and warm, possibly fuzzy. What this has got to do
    with non-geometric, non-grotesque sans serifs is beyond me.\r\n\r\nOne thing is
    critical to keep in mind: humanist type, as Morison would argue, comes not from
    the hand but from the punchcutter's chisel (or asp, or whatever grim thing it
    was). The type world today is full of minor Morison wannabes who have made, I
    admit, persuasive cases to the contrary. So chacun a son gout! \r\n\r\nThe overwhelming
    sense of 'humanist' today has nothing to do with type. We need a better term and
    it should be devised by someone without a commercial interest in promoting the
    term. For example, when speaking of a sans italic that is not a slanted roman,
    it is better to use the term cursive, which is precisely descriptive, rather than
    humanist, which is not."
