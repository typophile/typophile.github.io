    enough, the site features an ebook in which the headlines appear to be set in
    Neue Helvetica 25 Ultra Light, but that's not the font used in the logo."

    the logo is the B--Proba's is too narrow.\r\n\r\nMaybe Fivos, another forum member,
    can come up with a better match for you...."

    as though the same may be true of the ''A'' and the ''Y'' similar to the way that
    angled terminals are treated in Syntax. '

  body: "Good find, Don, but to jvdesign's point the legs of the R and A, and the
    arms of the Y all terminate at right angles to their strokes (at least on the
    fabricated sign in the photo), not parallel to the baseline. \r\n\r\nThey don't
    do that in either Proba or Cyntho.\r\n\r\nNow that could just be a function of
    the sign fabrication, but it could also mean we are close but not quite.\r\n\r\nAt
    the very least, Proba and Cyntho are very good alternates."
