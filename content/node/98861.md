body: "Hello again,\r\n\r\nit has been a pretty long time :)\r\n\r\nI was recently
  pretty busy designing a logo for Bernhard Kohl. He is a former professional cyclist
  who started his own bike and fitness shop 3 years ago. At the end of this year his
  franchise contract ends and so the shop needs a new name, new logo, new everything.\r\n\r\nI
  will try to keep it short: We have already decided on the letters B and K to be
  represented in a logo. No real innovation but OK.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 versions I
  would like to get your expertise and your impression on. Version 1 is the one that
  has already been approved by our client. At first glance it is just a capital B
  with 2 diagonal strokes. At second glance you should be able to see a capital K.
  Everyone seems to like the concept (that is why it has been approved) but somehow
  I am not satisfied with it. I think the K looks strange.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 is still
  fresh and so I am not really objective about it. I can only say that I think it
  is more iconic and clear-cut which makes it a better logo in my opinion. \r\n\r\nIf
  we had to decide for one of these two versions, which one would you pick?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your help."

  body: "I like the idea behind the first one but agree the K is a bit strange. Maybe
    the crossbar needs to be at an angle like the lines? \r\n\r\nAlso, the lines make
    me think of athletics more than cycling - maybe change the colour? "

  body: "On the first one I have to try real hard to see the K. The concept is interesting,
    though, and perhaps with some tinkering it'll work better.\r\n\r\nThe second one
    I like better, although I've seen a lot of logos that use a similar positive/negative
    concept. Be careful that the vertical on the K doesn't look too thick, the open
    space on its left will make it look wider than it really is."

  body: "I'd say that the second version is pretty bland. It's one of a handful of
    most obvious ways to make a monogram out of two letters. For the same reason,
    the first one is awesome. I'd try and replace the middle part with the actual
    K and see if it should/can be blended into B for visual consistency.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the URL in your profile doesn't work."

  body: Yea the second one is clear and competent but not compelling or as ownable.
    The first concept has a lot of potential, especially if you go back to some subtle
    visual cues from the cycling world to inspire the cuts and lines. With some refinement
    you will have a winner!

    the whole process I have never been able to convince myself to making the crossbar
    the same angle like the lines because I was too afraid of loosing the B. Maybe
    I should give it a try before I give up on this idea.\r\n\r\n@JamesM: Thank you
    for the tip with the thick vertical bar. Really a great observation.\r\n\r\n@apankrat:
    I have already tried to make the middle part of the logo an actual K and tried
    to blend it into a B. I have uploaded three of my favorite versions of this part
    of my journey. And thank you for your hint about the wrong URL. I have updated
    it.\r\n\r\n@Luma Vine: Your comment sums it up nicely. Version 2 ist clear but
    dull and version 1 has potential but is not there yet.\r\n\r\nIt is great to get
    this kind of feedback. I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about

  body: "Maybe my built-in gestalt processor isn't working properly, but all I see
    initially is a B with some stripes through it. It took me a long while to see
    the 'K' in those versions of the logo. And when I do finally see the K, the B
    disappears. I agree with hhp's comments about the counter shapes, and his bottom-most
    design, with somewhat wider stripes, makes both the B and the K more obvious.
    My personal preference was for the more angular versions of the B-K combo - they
    were clearer if less artistic.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    Or make it more rakish\r\n\r\nI'd be cautious about an approach like that. I used
    to do design work for a large corporation that had an angled logo and it often
    caused problems because optically it sometimes looked \"crooked\". Or to be more
    specific, the elements in it that were actually horizontal (like the white stripes
    in yours) would look slightly off, even though they weren't. "

    suggest the side-by-side tracks left behind by a car. Focus on the concept a bit
    more and you will be able to have a stronger result."

    to be come a subset of the 'B' and has to deal with being a bit more abstract.
    \r\n\r\nIn other words, the 'B' is overly dominating the 'K' and I don't know
    if people will necessarily make the leap to even see the 'K'.\r\n\r\nThat may
    or may not be a big deal. Just an observation. \r\n\r\nMaybe play with the contrast/color
    between the 'K' and the top/bottom of the 'B' to separate them a bit more?"

    tried to be very careful about the negative shape so the B does not end up looking
    strange.\r\n\r\nI am pretty satisfied with what I have right now and would love
    to hear your opinions about it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/horizontal-description_3733.gif]\r\n\r\nComparison

    feels to me like the K is way more obvious now and switching between perceiving
    it as B or K became a lot easier."
