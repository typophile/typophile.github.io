    that same period. Does that give you a hint?

      his sole use.

    be created?"

  body: 'The previously mentioned book on Renner will answer your question, especially
    chapter four. If you don''t feel like buying the book, email me and I''ll get
    you some info. It''s been several years since I read it, but if I remember correctly
    the creation of Futura had something to do with an alternative to the insistence
    on the use of blackletter forms by some segments of German society and evolution
    (for lack of a better word) of that style. It also reminds me of this comment
    by Wassily Kandinsky: "Every work of art is the child of its age and, in many
    cases, the mother of our emotions. It follows that each period of culture produces
    an art of its own which can never be repeated. Efforts to revive the art-principles
    of the past will at best produce an art that is still-born. It is impossible for
    us to live and feel, as did the ancient Greeks. In the same way those who strive
    to follow the Greek methods in sculpture achieve only a similarity of form, the
    work remaining soulless for all time. Such imitation is mere aping. Externally
    the monkey completely resembles a human being; he will sit holding a book in front
    of his nose, and turn over the pages with a thoughtful aspect, but his actions
    have for him no real meaning."'

  body: If you study Paul Renner, who is the creator of Futura, there is a lot of
    very interesting material both on the web and in books about him. Also research
    Art Deco and Futurism, and Germany of course.

  body: Regarding the book that was mentioned, if you don't want to buy it another
    option is to try your public library. If they don't own the book they can do a
    computer search to find another library that has it and borrow it temporarily
    by interlibrary loan, although it may take a week or two for it to arrive.

    References, Further Reading, and External links sections at the bottom of the

  body: "When I first saw the question of this thread, I thought it was unanswerable.
    There is no \"why\" in the sense that someone had a newspaper, and melting rubber
    rollers were causing the ink to smear (that's why Corona was created).\r\n\r\nBut
    why a font is created doesn't have to be an external cause. The artist could have
    had an intention in mind when creating it.\r\n\r\nMany popular books on typography
    will give this for Futura: basically, Futura is based on basic geometric shapes,
    straight lines and circles, and it was intended by the type designer to break
    with precedent by creating a type face based on such principles. (There were other
    such faces from that period, such as Kabel - but Kabel and Futura are <em>very</em>
    different typefaces, even though they share this attribute.)"

  body: 'To reflect the <em>zeitgeist.</em> In that respect, I think one can say that
    Futura was created for the same reason that, say, Baskerville was created: to
    provide typographic expression of a new visual culture that was not adequately
    reflected in existing typefaces from earlier periods.'

    was titled \xBBSchrift unserer Zeit\xAB it means the type of our time. Futura
    was influenced by the bauhaus and neue sachlichkeit movements based on geometric
    shapes. Also there where lots of other such faces like Erbar Grotesk oder Kabel.
    They are all very geometric and share similarities but where still different in
    detail.\r\n\r\n"
