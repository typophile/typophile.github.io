body: I'm at such a loss looking for the font from this sample. We are talking hours.
  I am grateful if you know of something close that I can cobble together a few words
  for a new project that is due soon. Disregard the cap "P" and "B" open stems if
  they aren't in your findings. Any ideas? Thanks!
