  What is the font for the \"Hamburger Helper\" title? It looks like a condensed and

    (one of the romans, not the italic), but has been extensively tweaked.

    what I meant when I said it has been tweaked. It's very common with packaging
    like this to see a brand mark that starts out from an off-the-shelf font (in this
    case Caxton), and then gets modified, sometimes before it hits the shelves, sometimes
    over a period of years. Part of the reason is so that the brand has a unique identity,
    something that can't be easily replicated with an off-the-shelf font. I don't
    think you will find a closer match than Caxton."
