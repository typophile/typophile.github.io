  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Okay, for the sake of conversation, let's just assume that I'm not a complete moron: I've been having this deep and painful obsession with COOPER BLACK for a good five months now.. it haunts me in my dreams and I want to put it in every single project that comes my way, I just think it's beautiful (even center justified). 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cooper_4036.jpg]

All of my designer friends and professors have been making fun of me NON STOP! So am I just crazy?? My professors say that I don't get it because I was born 1985 and was not around when it was most popular.. so after I graduate to the real world and you guys see me when you meet up for your lavish champagne and cocaine fueled black tie parties, are you gonna kick me out if I can't shake this thing?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">>are you gonna kick me out if I can’t shake this thing?

LOL. Yes.

Seriously though, I'm not sure I would want to put it into every project I do...but it has it's uses. I USED to like it too..for awhile...long long ago (pre design school days, when I also thought bradley hand was a nice font)

I actually like the curves and feel of it, but it's so...out of place for most things. So I've given up on it, UNLESS the right project comes along.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott,

People can be attracted to / enthusiastic over / obsessed with almost anything. 

Think about what attracts one person to another -- there's an incredibly wide range of possibilities: some people only like blondes, others only like redheads; some like people who are skinny, others only like people who are heavy; etc. There no right or wrong -- it's a matter of personal taste. However, there are some commonly accepted ranges of what constitutes good looks, and if you want a career as say, a casting director, and you only want to cast chubby redheads (because that what attracts you), you may expect to have problems finding work. 

The same reasoning applies to fonts. As hard as it is for me to admit, there is nothing wrong with being obsessed with Cooper Black, but you can't expect others to feel the same. 

Your best bet is to become a closet Cooper Black addict. Wallpaper your bedroom in Cooper Black specimen sheets, collect books with Cooper Black covers -- do whatever you want in the privacy of your own home, even share your obsession with friends (but don't expect much enthusiasm from most of them). 

When it comes to your professional life, strive to always pick the best typeface for the job (not for your personal taste). And who knows, one day maybe the perfect job will come along that will just demand Cooper Black.

		<div class="commentbody">I can understand Scott's obsession perfectly, for I had it to a lesser degree 40 years ago, when I was just a few years younger than he. I was an apprentice hand compositor in a shop that had a full range of mats for Ludlow Black, which was an interpretation of Cooper Black.

What did I not set in Ludlow Black when I was allowed use of the Ludlow machine on my own time? I set damn near everything in Black: friends' wedding announcements and invites, letterheads, the envelopes in which I returned correspondence school geography lessons to the university of Iowa, family letterheads. You name it. 

As Kent's examples show, Cooper offers good instruction in how to think about word space and leading that work best with a face. I did not realize it at the time, but I was in fact studying those aspects of typography as I used Black.

Eventually I moved on and forsook Black. My next love was Ludlow Garamond, which offered very different challenges. Soon enough I moved to a Monotype shop and then my young eyes really opened.

So go for it Scott: use it but don't abuse it. Black is great for early lessons. Maybe you will unlock some Black secrets and show us new ways.

LOL! For the record, back in 1986, when I was at university in Buenos Aires, we started a student design magazine (which lasted only three issues!). We wanted to avoid Times New Roman for the text face, because we'd heard that it could print with gaps... We ended up going with <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-souvenir/">Souvenir</a>. :-D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Scott,

Good for you; I am also a real fan of good ol' Cooper. I tried to convince my publisher to use it on the cover of my book, but I didn't win this battle. Though I am seeing more and more "trendy" books sporting this wonderful typeface, which makes me happy and smile too. When you are tired of Cooper Black, you might take a look at Souvenir, as mentioned, or Goudy Black (the shameful rip-off from FW Goudy), or Soap, or Supercooper, or Rosemary... And you might also sigh at the view of this wonderful handwriting example of Oz Cooper, basically Cooper Black but with more freedom and more je-ne-sais-quoi.

Long life to Cooper Black, a truely beautiful typeface.

Here is some information about that COOPER BLACK, the older type vets may know all this, but this could add a few bits to better
understand the type style. 

Oswald Bruce Cooper designed the face in 1921, released by Bernhart Brothers & Spindler of Chicago in 1922. The style began to appear everywhere, Oz Cooper attempted to patent the design and failed because it resembled a design in a logo. The type face
remained prominent as late as the 1970s.  

The rest of you can take it from there. Have Fun!!!</div>

Also, I must comment that I still cannot understand why many designers do not like Souvenir. Although I don't use it that often, I do find uses for it occasionally.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For anyone interested, and to continue Greg Ruffa's post, here is a somewhat more detailed background info about the typeface and Oz Cooper:

Oswald "Oz" Bruce Cooper was born on april 13th, 1879 in Mount Gilead, in Ohio - USA. At 15 he moves to Chicago and decides to become an illustrator; to do so, he enters the Frank Holme school where he will become friends with another student, William A. Dwiggins, and also with his handlettering teacher, Frederic W. Goudy. After a few weeks Oz Cooper understands he's far better in lettering than drawing, and he actually becomes lettering teacher himself in that very school for 2 years before the school closes, out of money.

He then associates with an illustrator, Fred S. Bertsch, and together they create the advertising agency Bertsch & Cooper in Chicago in Chicago in 1904. Thay both travel in Europe in 1912 and they discover many things there including the curvy and organic Art Nouveau, which will have a strong influence on their work. In 1913, Oz Cooper draws an alphabet to use it in an ad for the engine company Packard, and soon after sells this typeface through ATF; in 1914, the Bertsch & Cooper agency, which is very successful and has 50 employees, officially adds "typeface design" to its range of services.

Oz Cooper, at this time, is used to write his own lettering at the time, on his correspondance notes and business cards: a roman alphabet very bold with rounded serif, influenced by what he discovered in England and France. He understand its commercial possibilities and makes it a typeface in 1921, naming it Cooper Black. The typeface is distributed by Barnhart Brothers & Spindler in 1922 and bought by Schriftguss AG in Dresde (Germany) in 1924, who will add an italic. The same year, Oz Cooper sells his shares of Bertsch & Cooper and begins to work freelance.

The advertising, which is growing every year in the newspapers, gets a grip on Cooper Black and uses it extensively, because of its very strong personnality and the way it stands out of a page; therefore, very quickly, every founder in town releases its own version of Cooper Black: Bitstream Cooper, Ludlow Black, Burlesque, Plymouth, and even Goudy Heavyface, made by Frederic Goudy, the teacher and friend of Oz Cooper, who is bitterly disappointed. Cooper tries to register his design, but the National Commission rejects his request; he contests the decision and wins the case in 1930, but the commission fights back in 1931 and declares that Cooper Black is too close to the typeface used in the logo of the construction company Asbestone. Oz Cooper gives up, tired and sick. He will work a little more (he will for example create the new graphic standards of the Chicago Daily News), before dying from cancer on december 17th 1940, aged 61. Sinbce then, all his drawings and sketches are at the Newberry Library in Chicago.

In the following years, Oz Cooper is not here anymore to promote Cooper Black, which falls into oblivion while Futura, Kabel and the others geometric designs are reaching stardom and domination. In 1966, the graphic designer Tommy Steele is working on the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds album cover, and finds Cooper Black in an old book; the typeface's curves and flower-like joy fits perfectly with the summer of love to come, and he decides to use it. The album is a hit smash, and instantly, Cooper Black becomes the 8th wonder, first on pop rock disc covers, then everywhere, becoming one of the visual reference of the era and its ideology. Everyone wants it: Frank Zappa, The Doors, Robert Crumb, Garfield, Dr Pepper, Burger King, Payless Shoesource, Quality Inn... It becomes available on precut stickers, multiplies on cheap shops, and at the beginning of 1980, turns into a cheapo, ugly type that nobody wants to use anymore; in 1990-1995, it hits rock bottom, and is the universal synonym of cheapness (Easyjet understands it very well).

It's only at the beginnig of 2000 that talented graphic designers and typographers will bring it back from the grave and use it in inspired designs, but it's still uneasy because of his very heavy burden, and requires a large amount of skill and sensibility. Some new designs inspired by Oz Cooper early sketches also appeared in the last 10 years, including Rosemary by Chank Diesel.

And that's all folks, more or less faithfully translated from my own book.

Not all Cooper Black was melted down, for instance it was still included in the Mono-Lino (Toronto typesetting company) type catalog in 1952.

And this from <em>Playboy</em>, 1965, which had a circulation of 5 or 6 million at the time:

Well, <em>Playboy</em> is my go-to source for 1960s American advertising, with all the best "Big Idea" ads, but I'm sure the Teacher's ad would have run in other publications. I also have a few <em>Sports Illustrated</em>s. This 100% Cooper (except for the horizontal rule) ad from 1964:

That's what I was thinking, although I haven't seen any pictures of Mrs Cooper. Zaftig, I suspect :-)

<em>How do you manage it?</em>

I've been collecting magazines for many years, mainly to develop an understanding of the history of my line of work (I was an ad agency art director), as it is not taught at school or in history books, except obliquely. The major (in terms of circulation) American magazines, Saturday Evening Post, Life, Playboy, Esquire, Time, and other collectibles such as Fortune, are readily available in old paper shows and shops. I've also dedicated part of my studio as a library, so that's it's easy to put my finger on stuff quickly.

		<div class="commentbody">To go on with Nick's last post, I've always been myself fond of collecting magazines for the type used in their ads, and it has always been very profitable to my own understanding of the society and the graphic design / advertising world in general. Esquire and Playboy are ranking in the firsts, but I unfortunately don't have a lot because I didn't grow up in America. Thanks to Taschen and their American Ads series, I now have some really good ones at hand. On the other hand I have a lot of french magazines from 1960's - 1980's, and they are priceless in what they bring to me.
