<p>It is a fast pace racing game I&rsquo;m designing for and the interface should project the semiotics of a fast expensive sports car. Does anyone know of a font the has this feel yet will render well on-screen?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I recommend that you consult with a company like Ascender corp or Monotype (or others) that will develop a solution for you. As it stands now. If you purchase a commercial font system 1. its probably not licensed for embedded products such as video games 2. and the font is not designed for television screens (a serious problem).</p>
<p>So at the minimum thing you need to consider is if font vendor is willing to sell you an embedding license if a custom type is too expensive.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think you have to restrict your inquiries to large (if that is the term) font companies. Any type designer working seriously will have terms and licensing for this sort of project. You will have to contact them directly, since this sort of thing is rarely handled in a standard EULA.</p>
<p>But do remember that it will be an expensive proposition, so a custom solution may be just as cost effective as a large commercial embedding license of an existing design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Depending on the platform/s the game will run on and type of rendering there may be various technical and licensing issues to deal with.</p>
<p>Windows based games often include real TrueType fonts, installed privately or sometimes system-wide. Depending on the rendering techniques used, some hinting may be advantageous, but most commonly un-hinted fonts, rendered using full anti-aliasing provide adequate results at all but the smallest type sizes. Of course most games publishers understand that in these cases fonts need to be properly licensed, and coupled with the discoverability of unlicensed fonts in their products they tend to do the right thing.</p>
<p>On other platforms, bitmap fonts are generally used. The outline font is run through a converter and a derivative bitmap font is produced using an OS rasterizer - often hints and other settings are respected. This font is then texture-mapped to objects including UI elements in the game. Because the actual source font is not included in the product, some publishers will ship these derivative fonts in violation of the EULA. More reputable publishers will acquire the required rights from the font maker.</p>
<p>Regarding costs I’ve found that in most cases license rights are cheaper than custom from-scratch work, but sometimes it makes sense to have a custom font designed, especially if it’s a strong brand element for a series of products and will be used promotional material.</p>
