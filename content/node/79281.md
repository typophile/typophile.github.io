  this time by taking better care to define each font into a collection.  I have my
  basic classifications listed already; serif, sans serif, blackletter, script etc
  etc...\r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for is good deeper classifications others may be
  using.\r\nSome other Categories I have are Condensed Serif, Condensed Sans Serif
  and Wood Type\r\n\r\nI know these may differ depending on the persons library and
  preference but I was curious to see how others are breaking their libraries down
  and hope to get some good ideas in the mean time."

  body: "@eliason Thank you for those links.  They are helpful.\r\nI did find a few
    of them before posting as well but had not thought to post them for reference.\r\nI
    wasn't able to find any recent threads and only a few posts really broke it down
    in the form I was looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\nas a jumping point this is a combination
    of what I have been using as well as multiple categories I have added from my
    research the last few days.\r\n\r\n-Serif\r\n-Sans Serif\r\n-Script\r\n-Slab Serif\r\n-Condensed
    Serif\r\n-Condensed Sans Serif\r\n-Small Caps\r\n-Wood Type\r\n-Black Letter\r\n-Ornament\r\n-Angular\r\n-Numbers\r\n-Distressed\r\n-Deco\r\n-Retro\r\n-Handwriting\r\n-Sign
    Painter\r\n-Headline Serif\r\n-Headline Sans Serif\r\n-Body Serif\r\n-Body Sans
    Serif\r\n-Generic Logo Fonts\r\n\r\n\r\nIts a lot of classifications but they
    become quite useful for me, I am a freelance designer and jump around from packaging
    to branding to publishing and these categories allow me to quickly grab what I
    need.  These are built from necessity and experience but I am always open to others
    thoughts and critiques.\r\n"

    is very good alternative to Fontcase. It is the ultimate font utility for users
    who require a quick, easy and comprehensive overview of all their fonts on Mac.
