  vertical axis):\r\n\r\n1) given by Harold Evans (after V. Steer) in <em>Newspaper
  Design</em> (1973);\r\n2) proposed by Albert A. Sutton in <em>Design and Makeup
  of the Newspaper </em> (1948);\r\n3) \"just trust your eye\".\r\n\r\nEach of them
  gives, let's say, quite different results. Common to these methods is that the optical
  center lies slightly above the geometric center of the figure (I don't mention my
  students claim the optical center is located right in the middle).\r\n\r\nThe question
  is:\r\ndo you know other methods, formulas or have links to similar issues which
  would help to clarify or form an opinion on the matter? "

  body: "\"Trusting your eye\" is really as many methods as there are people using
    it. \r\n\r\n\r\nthe first two methods sound as idiosyncratic and arbitrary as
    the last. (... I say without knowing anything about them)\r\n\r\nYour students
    are obviously referring to the optical middle. :o)\r\n\r\nmy method isn't really
    very helpful: \"It doesn't have to be right. I has to look right.\" \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I haven't heard of an \"optical center\" other than on the horizontal axis,
    for spacing purposes. That was championed by David Kindersley. I think there is
    something to his idea, but he never really nailed it down to a formula that worked
    consistently. \r\n\r\nVertically, when you divide a space vertically such as e
    or E, the visually equal division is somewhat above the geometrical center. But
    I suspect that that apparently equal division will vary with the design of the
    rest of the figure. So, eg the crossbar of the H and A will be in different places.
    So there isn't one single number for a \"vertical center.\"  "

  body: It really depends on the distribution of weight in the character, in my opinion.
    Optical center of the /e/ would be different from the optical center of the z
    with a stroke through it.

  body: Maybe I'm not young, healthy, and surely not nice enough, but the last example
    feels unbalanced to me. Obviously it depends on context and application, but I
    probably would go with something inbetween yours and the last one.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4616.jpg]\r\n\r\nLet's scope
    on the simplest example, because we all are aware of slight differences caused
    by interaction of more complicated shapes, like letters.\r\nI am not interested
    in optical centering itself - it's not my life's goal - but lastly I am really
    curious of what causes we need to place something that \"has to be in the middle\"
    at least a tad ABOVE. Is it related to - I don't know - neurophysiology (like
    anticipating an event, eg falling object)?\r\nThe Evans' rule seems to be linked
    with the golden ratio; it creates strong diagonals feeling, while Sutton is probably
    more an \"optical tricker\".\r\nMaybe the relation among the four examples is
    rather culture- or design-driven thing?"

  body: 'I agree with Riccardo, but the important thing in designing a typeface is
    to make the divisions work *in conjunction with other letters*. All of these could
    work, depending on the design. I''m sure you can find the cross bar on the H at
    all of these levels in good fonts. That''s why the vertical alignment always is
    a matter of the eye, looking at, and deciding on, the whole design. '
