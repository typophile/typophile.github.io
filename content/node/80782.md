  He's provided me with Duarte for some of the other areas of the poster, but I need
  to find the font I've attached here as it has been used on previous posters and
  the client doesn't have it. I ran it through whatthefont but to no avail.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas guys? Help much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mvb-magnesium/?refby=typographica\">Magnesium</a>
    is a decent match.\r\n\r\nBTW, I made <a href=\"http://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/wpa_gothic\">a
    font</a> based on another WPA lettering style. I'll give you a good deal on a
    commercial license if you're interested. ;)"

  body: Thanks for the help. Magnesium is a good match. Thanks for the offer too,
    but I only need Duarte and whatever this other font is for the project at hand
    :)
