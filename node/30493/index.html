There it states that, "Nowadays, successful feature films may be dubbed into Spanish in up to three different "standard" versions: Iberian (or European) Spanish for Spain (Castilian Spanish); Rio-de-la-Plata Spanish for Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina, Mexican Spanish for Mexico; and another one for the rest of Latin America."
I would think that the OT spec would recognize the divergence of the Spanish languages to a greater degree than it does.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The differences in pronunciation and vocabulary between different regions for Castilian (i.e., "Spanish") are substantial, but this doesn't affect typography. "Voces" might be pronounced "vothesh", "vos's", or "vose", but it's spelled the same everywhere, and any rules concerning syllable division, accent marking, digraphs, capitalization, etc. are also the same everywhere. So far as I know, all the countries concerned follow the orthographic standards set by the Real Academia Española, so even when the RAE changes something that might affect OT behavior - like the changed alphabetization rule of 1994 - it is adopted everywhere. Of course, this could always change in the future, at which time a new tag might be needed.</div>

Spoken languaje is quite different, the pronunciation of the c,s and z and the pronunciation of the v and b are the main differences but there is also intonation and even grammar (Argentinians have some twisted ways of using verbs). In México the letter "x" which is pronounced like "j" in many words (including México).

I have had a situation where we needed a translation of a brochure into Spanish. There were 2 Spanish speaking individuals as part of the clients team. They were from different countries though and kept getting into arguments about the translation. It was sort of like a Mac vs PC flame-war thing. They each wanted the translation to be done by different people because of the kind of Spanish. This was to be a printed document so no phonetics were involved. They were both pretty passionate about differences. I never got the grasp of what the problem was, most of their arguing was done in Spanish. Eventually, the project was dropped.

It has been a while but I think one was from Pueerto Rico and the other from western Mexico. Since I don't speak Spanish, I am not sure exactly what was going on. They may just have had some personal differences for other reasons for all I know. Now that I see from what you all say, there is nothing to get up in arms about between written text versions of Spanish.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, if Puerto Rican Spanish is like Cuban Spanish (La Tremenda Corte - ¡Venga la sentencia! / ¿Qué tu te crees?) I'm sure they had an argument... it's just that Spanish is very vesatile, we have many ways and words to say a single thing, in English you have a single word to say many things instead.

But I would agree that the most extreme variant of spanish is that one from Argentinians with things like "decime, andate or vení" and "vos". Lunfardo, Chilango and other ways of speaking which I may ignore are more twisted yet but they are more like argots.

I have a friend whose father is from Nicaragua and every time I call him to his house and his father answers I have to bite my cheek to avoid laughing because It's hard to understand what says... he talks so fast and eats so many letters.

Some words are common in one place and insults in others like cajeta which is a burnt milk candy in Mexico and a vulgarity in South América.

However when written, Spanish breaks all this kind of boundaries, it may have been an issue of coloquial language or regional terminology Chris.

You're right; I guess my vocabulary is way out of date (I haven't been in Spain much in nearly 20 years). I checked with a friend who says "calculadora" used to be the "official" word, but everyone now would call a PC an "ordenador" (modeled on the French word "ordinateur").</div>
