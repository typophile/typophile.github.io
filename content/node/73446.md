  to have a font where part of it needs to be in javascript.  Actually one letter
  only, is there a possibility to put javascript letter within a font?  Though if
  technically it is not possible with only 1 letter then a total javascript font.
  \ Thus is a total font in javascript possible?\r\n\r\nThis letter \u0915 on the
  posting, is it in javascript, can the k/K on a font be removed and this \u0915 javascript
  be put instead?  This will allow users to type with this javascript on text editors
  or wordprocessors that allow javascript any internet content that can then be copy/pasted. "

    coding language used in font files is called Opentype. It\u2019s the only one
    with broad application support. With OT you can easily substitute one glyph for
    another for use in text editors and word processors that support it using for
    example contextual alternates."

    this site does is say K IS BAD in badly written english (constantly using the

    and then cites a whole bunch of religious babble.\r\n\r\nOn the \"basis\" page
    it states \"Because the shape of alphabets can give meaning.\" That is completely

  body: This is a job for a browser extension/plugin. It can probably be accomplished
    be with a Greasemonkey script but you'd probably want to develop a custom extension
    for ease of deployment. Hire a qualified programmer to create extensions for whatever
    browsere are popular in your country. That way you can effectively filter most
    of the K's on the web. Making a custom font is a bad idea because you'd still
    have to write an extension to replace all fonts with this new font. Plus it wouldn't
    as well hinted, you'd need a monospaced version etc. An extension that simply
    swaps on letter would be easy to write, easy to deploy and would work on almost
    all web sites. Of course, you probably can't block a K in a bitmap or Flash but
    you can get most of them.
