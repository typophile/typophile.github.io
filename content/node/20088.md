body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nI was wondering if recently anyone had the chance to check
  out mac systems at the Apple store. Every machine has Apple Myriad (a specially
  modified version for Apple) and Adobe Myriad installed. There is also some new fonts
  too- Blair and a distressed 'warehouse' looking font seen here by either Letraset
  or Bitsteam:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked one of
  the sales reps if Myriad was standard and he did not know what I was talking about
  and the genius bar requires a huge wait.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo if you have any info... please
  share.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

    href=\"fhttp://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301332\">here</a> is a
    list of system fonts for 10.4. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if iWork '06 comes bundled
    with Myriad but <a href=\"http://mac.sillydog.org/iwork/fonts.php\">here</a> is
    a list of fonts that came with the '05 release.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps."

  body: "Mike, ITC Portago is the name of your warehouse face.\r\n\r\nConsider this.
    There are fonts that come with the iWork and Office trials that come with any
    new Mac. <em>And</em> you can still use them after the trial period is over, of
    course. Odd situation.\r\n\r\nI have a dual core iMac and it didn\u2019t come
    with Apple Myriad. Creative Suite provides the regular, pro, std and web versions,
    though."

  body: "Grot Esqu\xE9> \r\nThanks for that information. At the Apple stores the they
    do have Adobe CS suite installed so that why I saw Adobe Myriad there then- okay
    good deal then. And thanks for ITC Portago. There was a few (like one or two)
    new things by Letraset or Bitsteam....can't remember.\r\n\r\nThomas Phinney> I
    was almost sure that Apple Myriad was just for Apple store demos but I just wanted
    to be sure... after all the new intel macs are new ballgame\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
    again guys   '-)\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"
