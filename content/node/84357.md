  body: "GSUB lookups are sets of substitutions of the same type which are invoked
    when a particular feature is activated. All of the substitutions in a particular
    lookup will be applied before any substitutions in subsequent lookups. Each opentype
    feature is associated with one or more lookups.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to explicitly
    declare lookups within your feature blocks since FontLab will automatically group
    your substitutions into lookups of the appropriate type (in this case it should
    combine all of your substitutions into a single lookup since they are all type
    4 GSUB substitutions, i.e. ligature replacement rules).\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes
    it is advantageous to declare lookups yourself, and this might be one of those
    cases. You don't have to name your lookups like I have done above, but doing so
    allows you to refer to them in other feature blocks if needed.\r\n\r\nsee http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#4.e

  body: "The f_U comes in first because of what Andr\xE9 said. The GSUB looks for
    the first applicable sub in the text chain, so F U even though its further down
    the feature code list is the first instance of a substitution. If you have conflicting
    usages like this with ligature sets a simpler solution might be to create a longer
    ligature and put that before the others in code. \r\nSo like:\r\nsub F U T U by
    F_U_T_U;\r\nsub F_U by F_U; \r\n\r\nYou could break it up however works best for
    you, but a longer ligature ahead of the rest should repair any conflicts.\r\nStephen"

  body: "Minerva,\r\n\r\nLookups are little procedures that are defined as a list,
    and then features refer to certain lookups. Multiple features can refer to the
    same lookup, and one feature can refer to multiple lookups. Lookups are always
    processed in the order they are defined.\r\n\r\nEach lookup processes a glyph
    run from the beginning (for simplicity, let\u2019s assume that a glyph run is
    a line of text). Within one lookup, the OpenType Layout engine looks for <strong>one
    best</strong> (longest) match, executes it and it proceeds to the next glyph and
    looks for the best match again \u2014 until the end of the glyph run. Then the
    next lookup is processed, with the resulting glyph run from the previous lookup
    as input.\r\n\r\nFeatures always refer to lookups. In the AFDKO syntax, there
    is a simplification that allows you to write:\r\n\r\n<code>feature dlig {\r\n
    \ # (all other substitutions)\r\n  sub U T by U_T;\r\n  sub F U by F_U;\r\n  sub
    T U by T_U;\r\n  # (all other substitutions)\r\n} dlig;</code>\r\n\r\nbut what
    it actually means is:\r\n\r\n<code>feature dlig {\r\n  lookup dlig1 {\r\n    #
    (all other substitutions)\r\n    sub U T by U_T;\r\n    sub F U by F_U;\r\n    sub
    T U by T_U;\r\n    # (all other substitutions)\r\n  } dlig1;\r\n} dlig;</code>\r\n\r\nor,
    more precisely (using AFDKO 2.5 syntax which is not implemented in FontLab Studio
    5.0 but is implemented in Fontographer 5 and in the upcoming FontLab Studio 5.1):\r\n\r\n<code>lookup
    dlig1 {\r\n  # (all other substitutions)\r\n  sub U T by U_T;\r\n  sub F U by
    F_U;\r\n  sub T U by T_U;\r\n  # (all other substitutions)\r\n} dlig1;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    dlig {\r\n  lookup dlig1;\r\n} dlig;</code>\r\n\r\nThe simplified AFDKO syntax
    blurs that reality, but it\u2019s good to remember that that\u2019s how it works:
    lookups are defined separately from features, and features refer to lookups. In
    other words, lookups define what happens with different portions of the glyph
    run and in which order, and features define when it should happen (i.e. under
    which circumstances, e.g. when the user expresses a certain typographic preference).
    Yet another method of looking at this would be to say that features provide the
    \u201Cuser interface\u201D to the OpenType Layout mechanism in the font, and lookups
    provide the \u201Cimplementation\u201D.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have the glyph run <code>/F/U/T/U/R/E</code>
    and your \u201C<code>dlig</code>\u201D feature refers to just one lookup (as shown
    above), the OpenType Layout engine proceeds like this:\r\n\r\n1. Start processing
    lookup \u201C<code>dlig1</code>\u201D referred by feature \u201C<code>dlig</code>\u201D
    with input glyph run <code>/F/U/T/U/R/E</code>:\r\n<code>/F/U/T/U/R/E</code> \u2014
    no match\r\n<code>/F/U/T/U/R</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/F/U/T/U</code> \u2014
    no match\r\n<code>/F/U/T</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/F/U</code> \u2014 match!
    substitute <code>/F/U</code> by <code>/F_U</code>, and proceed to the next unprocessed
    glyph\r\n<code>/T/U/R/E</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/T/U/R</code> \u2014 no
    match\r\n<code>/T/U</code> \u2014 match! substitute <code>/T/U</code> by <code>/T_U</code>,
    and proceed to the next unprocessed glyph\r\n<code>/R/E</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/R</code>
    \u2014 no match, proceed to the next unprocessed glyph\r\n<code>/E</code> \u2014
    no match, end processing lookup\r\n\r\n2. End processing lookup \u201C<code>dlig1</code>\u201D,
    resulting glyph run is <code>/F_U/T_U/R/E</code>\r\n\r\n3. Start processing further
    active lookups with the resulting glyph run (there is none, but there would be
    if e.g. \u201C<code>lnum</code>\u201D were active as well).\r\n\r\n4. End processing:
    resulting glyph run is <code>/F_U/T_U/R/E</code>.\r\n\r\nIf you want some substitutions
    happen earlier, you need to define it in a separate lookup earlier in the feature
    definition code \u2014 either by using the AFDKO keyword \u201C<code>lookup</code>\u201D
    or by defining it in a separate feature that is placed earlier.\r\n\r\nIf you
    write your code as:\r\n\r\n<code>feature dlig {\r\n  lookup dlig1 {\r\n    sub
    U T by U_T;\r\n  } dlig1;\r\n  lookup dlig2 {\r\n    # (all other substitutions)\r\n
    \   sub F U by F_U;\r\n    sub T U by T_U;\r\n    # (all other substitutions)\r\n
    \ } dlig2;\r\n} dlig;</code>\r\n\r\nor (using AFDKO 2.5 syntax) as:\r\n\r\n<code>lookup
    dlig1 {\r\n  sub U T by U_T;\r\n} dlig1;\r\nlookup dlig2 {\r\n  # (all other substitutions)\r\n
    \ sub F U by F_U;\r\n  sub T U by T_U;\r\n  # (all other substitutions)\r\n} dlig2;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    dlig {\r\n  lookup dlig1;\r\n  lookup dlig2;\r\n} dlig;</code>\r\n\r\nthen your
    input glyph run <code>/F/U/T/U/R/E</code> will be processed as follows:\r\n\r\n1.
    Start processing lookup \u201C<code>dlig1</code>\u201D referred by the \u201C<code>dlig</code>\u201D
    feature with input glyph run <code>/F/U/T/U/R/E</code>:\r\n<code>/F/U/T/U/R/E</code>
    \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/F/U/T/U/R</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/F/U/T/U</code>
    \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/F/U/T</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/F/U</code> \u2014
    no match\r\n<code>/F</code> \u2014 no match, proceed to the next unprocessed glyph\r\n<code>/U/T/U/R/E</code>
    \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/U/T/U/R</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/U/T/U</code>
    \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/U/T</code> \u2014 match! substitute <code>/U/T</code>
    by <code>/U_T</code> and proceed to the next unprocessed glyph\r\n<code>/U/R/E</code>
    \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/U/R</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/U</code> \u2014
    no match, proceed to the next unprocessed glyph\r\n<code>/R/E</code> \u2014 no
    match\r\n<code>/R</code> \u2014 no match, proceed to the next unprocessed glyph\r\n<code>/E</code>
    \u2014 no match, end processing lookup\r\n\r\n2. End processing lookup \u201C<code>dlig1</code>\u201D,
    resulting glyph run is <code>/F/U_T/U/R/E</code>\r\n\r\n3. Start processing lookup
    \u201C<code>dlig2</code>\u201D referred by the \u201C<code>dlig</code>\u201D feature
    with input glyph run <code>/F/U_T/U/R/E</code>:\r\n<code>/F/U_T/U/R/E</code> \u2014
    no match\r\n<code>/F/U_T/U/R</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/F/U_T/U</code> \u2014
    no match\r\n<code>/F/U_T</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/F</code> \u2014 no match,
    proceed to the next unprocessed glyph\r\n<code>/U_T/U/R/E</code> \u2014 no match\r\n<code>/U_T/U/R</code>
    \u2014 no match...\r\n\r\n4. Etc. until all active lookups have been processed
    on the glyph run.\r\n\r\nI hope you get the idea.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Yes, apostrophes are the key here. The reason for this is that <code> sub
    n g by n_g </code> will be interpreted as a simple ligature substitution rule
    and will therefore be assigned to a type 4 GSUB lookup. However, your previous
    line <code> ignore sub n' g' exclam </code> specifies a contextual exception which
    is only appropriate for type 6 GSUB lookups. This means they end up in separate
    lookups in which case your ignore line won't have any effect.\r\n\r\nBy adding
    the apostrophes to the substitution rule, you force it to be interpreted as a
    contextual rule (even though no context is provided) which will allow the compiler
    to place these within a single type 6 lookup.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
