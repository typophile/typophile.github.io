  body: "Florian - thanks; good tip! It looks as if someone has messed a little with
    it (obviously on the 'O')- but this is close enough to work with. For some reason
    the serifs seem to disappear at the ends, which causes printing problems - now
    I can go back and adjust this to suit...\r\n\r\nthanks for your time + Happy New
    Year!\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt"

    slightly \"eat away\" the outside of the characters so the serifs would become
    more delicate. And the O was simply tilted and a dot added at the centre."
