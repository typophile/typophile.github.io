  similar posts.. I'm trying to track down a couple of old fonts, Yagi Link Double
  and Dektiv. Yagi Link Double was in an old Letraset Catalogue, Dektiv was in the
  book Homage To The Alphabet.\r\n\r\nI assume these fonts were never digitised as
  I can't find references to them with any of the major type foundries or re-sellers..
  \r\n\r\nso a couple of questions..\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know whether the 'Homage To
  The Alphabet' that was published in 1990 is another edition of the one that was
  published in 1984? it has a slightly different title so may not be.. \r\n\r\nanyone
  got a copy of the 1984 one they want to sell me? or an old Letraset book with Yagi
  in it?\r\n\r\ndoes anyone have any decent size reference for either font? \r\n\r\ncheers"

  body: I have a copy of Homage to the Alphabet but there is no date noted so I'm
    not sure of the edition. It seems older than 1990, though. I purchased it on eBay
    and it's in excellent condition, but sadly the Y section was removed. I have only
    the index oneliner of Yagi to show. I can scan Dektiv when I get to the office.
    Planning to digitize?

  body: Ahh, found a 1980 price list in the binder pocket. Not sure if that verifies
    the date.
