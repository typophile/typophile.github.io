  Great. Then I realize I have to sign up to download it. Okay. Then I sign up and
  I can't locate any fonts, much less the one I found through Google. All I get when
  I do an in site search is blogs and forums.\r\n\r\nReally? "

  body: "Chris, Typophile.com is a site dedicated to fonts, typefaces and their designers.
    But not necessarily to download fonts. AFAIK there is no download of any font
    on this site. If you tell us which font you are looking for then maybe we can
    help you find it. But be aware: This site doesn\u2019t help you finding illegal
    copies of commercial fonts. "
