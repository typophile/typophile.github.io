  body: "From this time period you are probably looking at artwork (ruler drawn) or
    maybe a photo (film) typeface. I do not know of an exact match for this, but I
    found a free font that I think could easily be made to look like it. See [[http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/13011?text=ODYSSEY350|MTV2C]]
    at Abstract Fonts. If you square off the appropriate corners, add vertical serifs
    to the 3 and then slant the result, I think you are there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
