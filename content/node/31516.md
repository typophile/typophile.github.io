body: "I am writing this here, because it is a general topic category. I don't belong
  to any \"chat\" groups, I'm not a computer nerd -- but I just had an experience
  I felt I had to share with someone. And who knows -- this could happen to you.\r\n\r\nI
  belong to a club that has had a website since 2002. A year ago, the webmaster changed
  server hosts, and the new host told them it was transferring the site name as well.
  Well, the original register wanted their money - and the new host never asked....\r\n\r\nTo
  make a long story short, there was a screw up as to who we were to give money to
  to keep the site going. \r\n\r\nOn February 15th - a company in Australia bought
  the name from register.com\r\n\r\nIt's a club's site - no interest to anyone outside
  of the 200 to 300 people who visit is a year. \r\n\r\nI am now finding out this
  has become a common practice - and that sites are stolen like this all the time.
  The US government cannot do anything about it - because it is now under the jurisdiction
  of the Australian government. \r\n\r\nIf the club wants it back - it has to pay
  the new owner for it.\r\n\r\nDon't let this happen to you... I cannot believe there
  are folks that stoop that low...."
