  body: Here is the same font in action in a logo. It's the all caps font in this
    image, shown in "HANDCRAFTED BY" and "PHOTOGRAPHY."  It seems that the font can
    be used with various levels of tightness and looseness. Thank you for your help![img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_4832.png]
