body: "from Fournier's <em>Manuel Typographique</em> (1760s)\r\n\r\n<em>The punchcutter
  should neglect no means of imparting to his work the greatest perfection. Before
  entering upon it he should consider deeply of everything that may help to give it
  the greatest possible beauty. Unlike many trades, in which indifferent productions
  find a use proportionate to their worth, printing must have the best: not even the
  second best will serve; for it costs as much to cast and print ill-cut letters as
  to cast and print the very best; therefore if the punchcutter lack the necessary
  skill, the founder and the printer who reproduce his work, the one on metal and
  the other on paper, neither being in the least able to alter it, will only be giving
  permanent proof of his ignorance and dishonouring printing.</em>"

  body: "Another great quote in that vein, from Linotype's 1923 <em><strong>The Manual
    of Linotype Typography</strong></em>:\r\n<em>\r\n  The staffs of many printing
    offices lack any one with sufficient technical knowledge and creative feeling
    to originate pages beyond the commonplace. As a result, the output suffers from
    uninspired monotony, and there is nothing to attract new business, or to develop
    old customers into larger users of print.\r\n<em>\r\n  In other printing offices,
    no attempt is made to create even commonplace pages. Instead of this, books and
    catalogues already issued are used as models and copied boldly. Unfortunately,
    the type pages so imitated are frequently inferior, or, at best, the imitation
    is only an imitation, because the imitator has not grasped the principles which
    make the original design good."
