  Carter on British Television. <BR>I&#39;ve made a Quicktime movie of those 7 and
  a half minutes and put it on my Dotmac-site. I will leave it there until April 10.
  Feel free to download it &#40;32.3 MB file&#41;: <BR> <BR><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/WebObjects/FileSharing.woa/wa/default?user=bertvanderveen&amp;templatefn=FileSharing5.html&amp;xmlfn=TKDocument.5.xml&amp;sitefn=RootSite.xml&amp;aff=consumer&amp;cty=US&amp;lang=en"

  body: Well, that was excruciating. Matthew handles the inanities of television with
    remarkable good grace.

    at the Typophile Film Fest 04... I&#39;d love to see this  <BR>&#40;or excerpts
    of it&#41; in the Film Fest 05. <BR> <BR>My favorite line: <BR>Hostess: &#34;What
    do you think of Arial?&#34; <BR>Carter: &#34;Not much.&#34;'

  body: Hey thanks for the QT. But I think they could&#39;ve picked a more knowledgeable
    interviewer and the joke at the end was just..., well, we&#39;ve all heard a lot
    better. ;-&#41;
