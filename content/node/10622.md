  body: If you&#39;re using the Adobe FDK for OpenType, or FontLab, I generally suggest
    checking the Adobe FDK documentation. The document &#34;OT Feature File Syntax.html&#34;
    has this sort of info. This particular item is under 6a &#40;GPOS lookup type
    1&#41;. <BR> <BR>The first number is the adjustment to the glyph&#39;s position
    in x, and the third is the adjustment to the glyph&#39;s advance width in x. So
    in the example, the glyph is moved to the right by 5 units, and the advance width
    is increased by 10. The net effect is thus to increase both sidebearings by 5
    units. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know that anybody&#39;s done it, but I see no technical
    reason at the font-building level why you couldn&#39;t have multiple &#34;arguments&#34;
    to have one for small caps as well. But.... <BR> <BR>Adobe applications supporting
    &#39;cpsp&#39; do so automatically when &#34;all caps&#34; formatting is applied,
    and don&#39;t offer any other way to apply it AFAIK. So I doubt that &#39;cpsp&#39;
    on the small caps would ever get accessed. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Actually, I just went and tried it, and it is possible to get &#34;All Small
    Caps&#34; and text formatted as all caps at the same time in InDesign CS2. However,
    it does seem that the text engine thinks they are mutually contradictory, so success
    may depend on the order of application or something. <BR> <BR>As for the FDK,
    it has some additional documentation and useful testing/troubleshooting tools,
    even for people using FontLab. Since it doesn&#39;t cost anything, the price is
    hard to beat. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    Michael Hernan\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think, that the cpsp feature is intended to
    be a typographical mark like bold or italic. I think, it is just the other way
    around. Without additional spacing text that is set in capital letters drags more
    attention. The cpsp feature just shall make the text that is set in capitals or
    small capitals more legible. If the user wants to drag attention with the help
    of more letterspacing like 200 units, he should do that manually. And it is harder
    to correct the kerning between letters, if a feature that you cannot turn of enlarges
    the capital letter spacing by 200 units.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nPlease correct

  body: "A capital set against a lowercase letter is a whole different story than
    a capital set against another capital letter. \r\n\r\nA capital 'as is' in a font
    has side bearings which make it look good beside lowercase for 'sentence case'
    setting.\r\nThe 'All Caps' OT feature can correct this when setting just Capitals.\r\n\r\nI
    think the 200 units that my former self put in the code [above] is perhaps over
    generous and therefore a stylistic use of the feature. It looks like I was treating
    this as an automatic way to set small [top of page] headlines. (I am being Policed
    on this attitude elsewhere but will justify my actions on a case by case basis).
    [Wit] \r\nThanks for highlighting this.\r\n\r\nI will look at this again and correct
