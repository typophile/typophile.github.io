  Pilot in their iroshizuku fountain pen ink packaging.\r\n\r\nI suspect it is the
  Roman part of a Japanese font.  It is similar to Ryo Text Plusn, but isn't the same
  (note the y and g).\r\n\r\nThe Pilot site in the US has a nice enlargement feature:\r\nhttp://www.pilotpen.us/ProductGroup/723-Iroshizuku-Ink.aspx"
