  body: Yep, I think you might be right. I didn't think it was the new HP font ("HP
    Expressive") but the /a/ is double storey in the roman/upright and the rest of
    letters seem to fit too, although I think the sample may be the bold version of
    what is shown on your link above. Thank you.
