I just looked and the text font, David Berlow's Bureau Roman, has a 'short' f so that no ligature is needed.

The reason is that a small paper can use Quark or InDesign, but a large one needs a pagination system, and these are typographically challenged (good typography is not their priority). So, no sophisticated H&J controls, no ligatures.</div>

Not all that hard for me to believe, actually. Consider: Through much of the 20th century, the vast majority of newspapers used Linotype systems for setting their newspapers. As we all know, Linotype metal technology did not allow for kerning. Most faces included f-ligatures, but they were time-consuming to implement, so they weren't really used in newspapers. (Imagine if you had to actually type shift-option-5 every time you wanted an ﬁ ligature, instead of today's software handling it for you.) But since Linotype f's were designed not to crash, it wasn't really an issue.

I can imagine a pretty straight line from that predominant newspaper technology through the development of digital pagination systems for newspapers, with the result that today there are still many such systems without the kinds of typographic niceties that we take for granted in other applications.

I'm not defending, just trying to reason out an explanation.

I understand the culture being used to less-than optimal typography but I would have thought that implementation in todays world would be quite a bit simpler than it used to be. I know you are not defending, Kent :-)

		<div class="commentbody">I would be more concerned about the museum piece having bad type than the newspaper. Newspapers are massive products that undergo a 100% revision every 24 hours (or sooner). Quality may have been higher when craftsmen were doing the work, rather than machines, but it has never been a concern of the proprietors.

Ask at any newspaper how many proofreaders are left. If there are any, it will be less than 5% of what there was 40 years ago. Are reporters spelling better? I somehow doubt it.

Finally, I am reminded of a story about when the first pagination systems were coming out. Apparently the old time editor threw up his hands when the program hyphenated the word "God".

		<div class="commentbody">My thinking is that part of it is newspaper culture being accustomed to minimal typographic niceties. The other part is that the original development of pagination systems, following on what came before, probably did not put a premium on new features. There is a good chance that much of the layout infrastructure is still built upon something very close to the initial systems. The older and larger the paper, the more likely that would seem to me.

Newspapers are massive undertakings, with very intricate and interdependent editorial & design interfaces/workflows. I don't have first-hand experience with newspaper systems. But I would guess that implementing even very seemingly straightforward refinements might be more difficult than one might otherwise assume.

It would be interesting to examine the newer types designed specifically for newspapers by H+F-J and FontBureau; both have extensive experience testing and developing types for those systems, so I imagine they have dealt with this. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">With regard to newspaper pagination systems: these are primarily for rapid content management, i.e. laying out and co-ordinating input from hundreds of sources--writers, editors, designers, and of course the placement of advertisements. So any concerns a newspaper's design director may have about typography subtleties don't figure prominently. It's hard enough for these systems to get things like font names working correctly on all the different flavors of operating system and software that are involved; ligatures and proper fractions don't seem like an issue.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First, let's put a halt to all of the bad puns in headlines, then we can campaign against involuntary ligatures (like the unhappy marriage between the f and the i).

By the way, thanks for the explanation of why big newspapers are more likely to have these typographical problems. Sadly, it makes sense from a programming point of view.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">A lot of the systems actually descended from pagination software that was never intended for newspapers or anything that remotely resembles fine typography. They mostly descended from the pagination software designed to layout phone books.

Think about how awful it would be to paginate a phone book by hand? I get nightmares even thinking about it. 

So they developed the software to do it for them. That software then was picked up by newspapers originally to do classifieds. Before you know it, the entire works was dominated by the software, primarily because of a newspaper's primary source of revenue, the ads.

These systems are designed for the placement of ads, keeping track of ads, and billing for ads. Typography is far, far down that list.</div>

Here are some of the "no lig" types I've done for newspapers--Chicago Tribune, Globe and Mail, Daily Express (Worldwide), and Nicholas (not for a specific newspaper).

The arm of the f has to work with the shape and position of the i (and j) and l (b, h, etc.)
It's actually not as difficult as it would be for a text type, as those have a lot of width to "f", and large features. So it's easier to tuck the ball of "f" and the dot together in display type. Nonetheless, it can sometimes be a bit of a trade-off, and I think the ball of the Chicago "f" and the ear of the Nicholas Bold "f" are a bit twee, but not hopelessly so, and they do combine neatly.

Ligatures may not really be appropriate for headline type, in as much as they are too fussy for news. So they have the opposite effect to their original function at text size. Is it possible that for ordinary readers the typophile-offending example Chris posted is fine, and a ligature would be problematic?!

IMO the ideal solution is a "ligature" glyph (or contextual alternates), but with non-ligating forms nuanced for good fit, but of course, that won't work with CCI just yet.

		<div class="commentbody">All of this reminds me of the newspaper ad that was obviously meant to be about black shoes and black leather jackets but ended up talking about "African-American shoes" and "African-American leather jackets". Someone had obviously done a global find/replace on "black" and hadn't checked the results.

Yes, and we determined that typography could be much better in news, the web, and other stressful typographic situations if 'we' could dictate from the architecture of the OS down to the template of the document, how type works. But, there are other 'experts' too...

"Forget H&J the classifieds need H&FJ."
...ohp, there goes one now.

"IMO the ideal solution is a “ligature” glyph (or contextual alternates), but with non-ligating forms nuanced for good fit"
As Nick's samples show, though excellence can sometimes be assured, this does not work stylistically across the board, or Matthew would have done it for the Post. The problem, i.e. is not the fonts. :)
