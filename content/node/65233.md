  Anyone recognize it?

  body: "I agree Othello is very close, but at least the links that talked about using
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atfiorello-condensed/|PL Fiorello]] as a digital
    equivalent are wrong in this case, because that K is not the same, even if you
    ignore the width and weight differences. Maybe the film type Othello would have
    been used, assuming it had other forms, but Fiorello doesn't seem to be a match.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I have a copy of McGrew's book on American Metal Typefaces at home, which
    probably shows Benton's Othello design for ATF, but until the weekend I won't
    be at home. Does anyone else have a copy they can scan so we can prove Othello
    is the right answer? (I believe it is) Unfortunately, other than that Outline
    version on the Dover CD, I have heard of no other digital versions of the typeface
    used on that book cover. What was the publication date? If it was the 70's they
    probably used film type, I would guess.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    full set of DAN SOLO's EARTH as featured in his ART DECO  book. As there is another
    of the OTHELLO and its got a solid fill but the puncation looks like the outlined
    version without the outline. \r\n\r\nJohn"
