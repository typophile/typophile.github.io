  for the golden arches? And I didn't buy the coffee - it was, um, a co-worker, yeah
  that's it - a co-worker. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/mclig.jpg]

  body: It's hard to get the Sun in Knoxville, or Coalfield to be more exact. But
    it's easy (for my co-worker) to find a McD's.

  body: Here is a woodcut I did in college. A run of postcards was one of the first
    products to carry the P22 name (pre-dates the foundry by a few years) Should anyone
    choose to make satirical graphic art, here's a tip for avoiding McDonald's lawyers...don't
    print your address on it. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/mcscream.jpg]
