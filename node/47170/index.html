<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I’m try to avoid this:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yard-signs_5154.jpg]
and this:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/signspic_5590.gif]
Here is mine:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bigsign_6585.png]
12X18 inches for real estate signage
I am not allowed to redesign the logo for Trend Setter Realty and <em>must</em> be included in the sign. Also, I am awaiting the correct files from the National Association of Realtors—they have a malfunctioning eps file for download. The wording is clients choice, but I can make changes.
Fonts are Relato Sans Medium and Sanuk Fat from you-know-where.
If you have some ideas post images and I’ll try it your way.
Thanks guys et gals,
Mike Diaz</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I dunno how strict they are about their logo, but I would try enlarging the Trend Setter logo until it stretches across the entire sign, and move it to the top—so that the sign becomes the logo, then you could enlarge the blue area to fill the space below to put your text.
At least that's the first thing that popped into my head.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bringing back nightmares =) I design ads for a newspaper where I live and I have to go through these all the time. This is suppose to be a sign? Where is it going to be hung? Is it suppose to be one of those signs that hangs in front of a house they are selling? If so...you need to think about what is more important to the driver/walker by.
Right now, it looks like it should go in a newspaper as an ad. It's basically saying hey are you moving? then call here, and then you finally get to the bottom where you see who you will be calling.
If you are doing a sign in front of a house on the market, then people want to know that it's for sale first, then who's selling it, then where to call. Everything else should take a back seat.
But for the record, the ads that I do are mostly for small/private business' that want to have an ad in the newspaper to get extra money. So those ads that you posted as the "stay away from" ads actually prove to be very successful in getting business, because they are simple and get across the point almost instantly. "Form follows Function".

<div class=commentbody>Primary, secondary, etc... everything runs together. Create a focal message. Maybe block the upper question, red on white? Maybe try "Welcome to Canyon Lakes West", kind of friendly.
Color is very important. Red and yellow catches the eye, it can come off as obnoxious, is it the most readable? Yellow and black are the most readable, but ugly.
I'm glad to see you trying to break the mold!

<div class=commentbody>Thanks guys for the input thus far.
This sign is aimed at “inexperienced” buyers interested one particular housing development– namely Canyon Lakes West.
It’s not the sign the real estate agents uses in front of the home.
It’s also not a sign commissioned by the Canyon Lakes developer, but it is in fact from a real estate agent trying to get buyers to use him to purchase real estate in the Canyon Lake West area.
It will probably be stapled to telephone poles and staked on the corners of empty street lots.
I’m desperately trying to avoid American patriotic colors... YUCK!
And yes there needs to be more separation of the the question “Moving to Canyon Lakes West?”.
Any more ideas...???
Thanks
Mikey :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Is there a certain architectural style to Canyon Lake West? Perhaps you could get influence from that.
I'd go down a weight in Sanuk. It's too hard to read for someone driving by.David</div>

<div class=commentbody>In avoiding American patriotic colors, you've gone over to Chinese Communist colors instead? Anything is tough to read on a red field, since it reads simultaneously as a bright and dark color.
At least they aren't asking for headshots on the signs. Realtors love to show people what they look like, regardless of their appearance. Portraits on business collateral should be reserved for performers and prostitutes.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I sent my client the new designs. He loves it right (his favorite the blue and yellow iteration ala IKEA), then he tells me that color printing will cost too much... after he told me that he wanted color initially.
I put it in black and white, Sanuk Fat is too fat... you’re right , its tuff to read. I use something else. It looks just okay but the client loves it.
He still likes the original design. He’s gonna use it for a huge magnet sign that going to be attached to the side of his truck and the tail gate.
Oh well... thanks anyway guys</div>

Some of these were files that were saved after I had moved a bunch of stuff around and messed it up again, but saved it anyway.
As you can see I’m not very good. Especially when it comes to separation of space, scale... everything.
Next time will be better tho.

<div class=commentbody>I'm going to go ahead and guess that this guy (the client) doesn't care too much about color...it seems cheaper the better, so even a duotone still costs more than black and white prints.
