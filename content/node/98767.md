  I'm doing this poster and don't want to hassle with finding the perfect wood type,
  but I want something with a little more character that's available in digital. I'm
  currently using Grotzec X-Narrow Bold with some mods, but I'm not set on it. Hoping
  to get some other suggestions to very condensed grotesques that look a little more
  like wood type with interesting idiosyncrasies.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help,\r\nJoseph"
