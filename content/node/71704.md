  undertake a redesign of a well loved Australian bodyboarding magazine.\r\n\r\nWe
  are currently using Helvetica Neue as body copy, Corporate SQ for captions and Folio's.
  \r\n\r\nI am looking to find a typeface that is contemporary, clean, and legible.
  Our core reader group is aged 15 - 25 with that age increasing over the last few
  years. The magazine is youth oriented, fun, exciting and has been at the top of
  the genre for just over 20 years. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, serif fonts are the best
  for body copy, but i was wondering if there was a classy sans-serif font that would
  do the job nicely. the magazine still has to be relevant to the youth market, but
  i wish to add a touch of class and sophistication to the mag. \r\n\r\nMaybe a slab-serif
  font? \r\n\r\nMy current thoughts are: Accord, Centro Slab Pro, Vista Slab or Depot.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts would be greatly appreciated!"

  body: I think [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/tisa/|Tisa]] would be a wonderful
    choice for you. Centro Slab is also a good one. If you still prefer a sans, Accord
    is an excellent option.

    there is a display version of it, that might be useful for some extravaganza."

  body: "@Freiberger: Thanks! Tisa is a great looking font. will put that one in the
    mix for sure!\r\n\r\n@poms: Locator would be a great option for a sans-serif face!
    Thankyou!\r\n\r\nCheers for the help guys, we have now a Top 3 of each serif and
    Sans serif face that we will be putting through their paces. \r\n\r\nWill let
    you know the outcomes!\r\n\r\nthanks again!"
