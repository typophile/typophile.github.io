  pdf specimen is available. 12 Megs!\r\nhttp://www.typefacedesign.org/2009/\r\n\r\nArrotino
  uses contextual alternatives for many characters, even forming the \"ligatures\"
  in this fashion. (It also supports regular ligatures.)  From the document maker's
  perspective, what software (that can output pdf's) supports these types of contextual
  ligatures? InDesign? Quark? MS Word? Serif PagePlus? Scribus? MS Publisher? Others?\r\n\r\nAnd
  really, the same question about software that can output e-books.\r\n\r\nThis whole
  contextual alternative stuff is new to me, and I'm just trying to get a lay of the
  land. Thank you."

  body: "At least InDesign and Quark support contextual alternates and output PDFs.
    Not sure about the other programs you list, though I'm pretty sure most of them
    output PDFs. Of course, any program with a glyphs palette that shows all the characters
    in a font will let you choose alternates by hand, but may not necessarily support
    the OpenType functionality that will automatically substitute the glyphs. Hope
    this helps.\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: 'E-books don''t work like that: They''re an early stage of HTML/CSS and there''s
    no cross platform support for Opentype neither there nor online. Compound ligatures,
    where the lig is two part and the active part is located in a separate font and
    applied with f.ex span tag styling in text, would be an option if @font-face was
    supported across all platforms, but we''re not even there yet. '
