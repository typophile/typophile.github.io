    can't draw those letters all together in that word with a pencil or a vector program?
    Why do they have to have used a font, which itself would have had to be drawn
    originally?"

    as a typeface if you want one. Sean Freeman''s work IS stunning, here is the link
    to his website: [[http://www.thereis.co.uk]]'

  body: "I don't think that at all. It's just that the font looks really familiar.
    Nowadays there are so many script fonts available. I'm just curious how it's done,
    that's all. I wanna know how to do that too :) :)\r\n"

  body: "There are also a lot of people producing calligraphic/drawn pieces inspired
    by copperplate writing with tons of flourishes just now. It's everywhere. Enough
    already?  In UK Seb Lester has much prominence and produces lovely work (much
    ripped off). Alison Carmichael is another one. She has collaborated with Sean
    Freeman on other projects so could well have drawn the original lettering for
    him for the 'cream' piece. If it's a case of finding good script typefaces then
    that is a problem. Translation into type kills the life force! Much weedy and
    kitch. Commercial Script (Morris Fuller Benton 1906) is a pretty good model and
    robust too if that's what you want and is a kind of 'if it ain't broke don't fix
    it' choice. Matthew Carter's Shelley has his excellence but is a lighter weight.
    Doyald Young sells a really beautiful one from his own site, but it's a lighter
    weight too. Similarly, Ale Paul at Sudtipos has gourgeous Burgues with a vast
    array of alternates with various swashes. (his Piel and Adios are not copperplate
    but very impressive).  I'd like to know of more myself so let me know if you find
    something fab. Nothing beats integrity of writing/drawing here though does it?
    and work of the modern 'greats' like Doyald Young or Jean Larcher.\r\n"
