body: "<strong>[[Indices]]: [[Tools]]/[[Software]] : Fontographer</strong>\r\n\r\nFontographer
  is design software; an application for designing fonts and exporting various [[font]]
  file formats.\r\n\r\nSometimes people incorrectly refer to [[Typographer|typographers]]
  and [[Type Designer|type designers]] as \"fontographers\" -- an incorrect reference
  to the software and not the practice of designing type.\r\n\r\nThe program first
  appeared on the market in 1985, released by [[Altsys]], a software developer from
  Texas. Altsys, who developed Fontographer from version 1.0\u20134.0 was bought during
  the early 1990s by [[Macromedia]]. Macromedia then released version 4.1.\r\n\r\nFollowing
  version 4.1.x, Macromedia halted the development of Fontographer. For almost a decade,
  no serious work was done to the software, although several mysterious beta versions
  (Version 5) were floated to selected members of the type design industry. During
  the late 1990s, Fontographer began losing market share among professional designers,
  as [[FontLab]] became a more powerful tool. The lack of OS X support for Fontographer
  inflicted another serious blow to its market share.\r\n\r\nOn May 9 2005 [[FontLab]]
  Ltd. announced the licensing of the full Fontographer product line from [[Macromedia]]
  Inc. and its further development.\r\n\r\nMany well-established (i.e. older) type
  foundries have built custom [[Python]] scripts that automate repetitive tasks in
  Fontographer. Thus some firms still use Fontographer."
