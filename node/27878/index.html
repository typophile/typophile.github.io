  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello there all,</p>
<p>A discussion croped up in our design studio the other day and thought I would open the discussion here, as I am aware of the depth of knowledge present most days. This may have been raised before, but here goes&hellip;</p>
<p>We use image libraries often, all the usual ones without naming them, and we were contacted by one of them to let us know that they now offer hi-res images for use in client visuals. A great idea I thought.</p>
<p>I have slight problem though, in that when putting together a presentation for a pitch, I want to try new typefaces in my designs that I don&rsquo;t yet own. The studio I work for won&rsquo;t buy new fonts until a job has been won, or the client requests it. So I&rsquo;m stuck. It&rsquo;s very frustrating believe me.</p>
<p>I just wondered what people&rsquo;s thoughts were on a temporary or short term license for fonts so as designers can utilise them in their presentations, and then if the job is won make the purchase?</p>
<p>I work in the UK by the way and am recently graduated so there may be an answer already out there that I don&rsquo;t know about!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>R.</p>

<p>…so, you need to fine-tune your client presentations in such a way that you get your clients to request the new typefaces ;-)</p>
<p>On a more serious note, Mr. Red, there <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --> other ways to show fonts to clients without having them built into your presentation boards or slides. These include specimen book pages, print-outs from the online PDFs that many designers and foundries have on their websites, or jpgs taken from the letter-setters that most foundries offer online too.</p>
<p>Try to get your client to sign-off on your overall concept first. Then say that, in order to get the message that they have already approved just right, you&rsquo;ll need to select the perfect typeface [together]. Oftentimes, at this stage, clients will be willing to look at typesettings outside of the of client visuals, since they have already signed off on the photography, layout, etc.</p>
<p>Also, if you are just putting together first round comps, you can always use a typeface you already have in that, and then try to get the client to sign-off on a more specific font later. This has worked for me quite often. For instance, you can substitute Adobe Garamond with a more specific Garamond later, Futura with a newer geometric sans, etc.</p>
<p>On another note, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some foundries do offer trial versions of their fonts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but not the same way your stock photo supplier offers images. FontShop seems to offer one weight of a family as a free trial download about every month. Many foundries will give you fonts on a trial basis if you call and/or e-mail their sales and/or marketing departments and let them know <!-- raw HTML omitted -->specifically<!-- raw HTML omitted --> what you are looking for.</p>
<p>For instance you could call them up and say, &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m working on a new ad campaign proposal for Coca-Cola in the US Northwest market. We&rsquo;re making new billboard designs and want to show the client our layout in Avenir and Candice. Can we use trial fonts for this presentation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This comes across much better (and as much more believable) than an e-mail that says, &ldquo;Can you e-mail me your newest fonts so that I can spec them for some project, etc.?&rdquo; Once you buil up relationships with foundries and/or designers, this process gets easier, too. To a degree, its about trust, openness, and communication.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I recently asked two foundries to provide some sample setting of a potential client&rsquo;s company name in various case formats in pdf format for a similar kind of presentation, both were kind enough to send them. MAC Rhino and Underware were the foundries, but I&rsquo;m sure there are many you could approach.

		<div class="commentbody">Oh I know this debate well. Then you purchase the font and the client changes their mind and  doesn&rsquo;t want to pay for it. Ultimately nobody loses tho because if you really love a font you&rsquo;ll use it for something else.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Firstly thank you all for your replies.</p>
<p>To Dan, the thing is I only design the work, the presentation isn&rsquo;t made by myself, the creative directors see to that and they are the pnes that OK which fonts are purchased.</p>
<p>I do also use pdf&rsquo;s and samples etc, but I find increasingly, especially lately, presentations are becoming slicker affairs with alot of placements of the identities so the client can visualise it in situ, I want to be free to use the font in a vast variety of visuals.</p>
<p>This whole thing is more a problem when I just don&rsquo;t have a similar looking enough font to what I want. Of course I agree with you I could do plenty of things, and try explanations to discuss what I want, but I can&rsquo;t help wanting to get my hands on fonts to really put them through there paces and let the client aknowledge that this font is the one from the word go!</p>
<p>And also I didn&rsquo;t know that they may let me have trial use, I will have to try that.</p>
<p>To Pattyfab, I totally agree, and they would never &lsquo;go to waste&rsquo;, I would be itching to use a nice typeface in future projects, it&rsquo;s just it&rsquo;s not my call!</p>
<p>Anyway you&rsquo;ve opened my eyes, and thanksfor that, I would love to know what other type designers thought on this matter, would they have anything against this idea?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>R.</p>
