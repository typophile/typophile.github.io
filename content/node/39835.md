  I recall seeing a face that I think was based on something from Germany in the 1920s
  or 30s. I've gone back and can't find it anywhere, but I doubt it's that tough to
  ID. Characteristics:\r\n\r\n-- Heavy/Thick\r\n-- San-serif with (I think), very
  slightly rounded corners\r\n-- Used for signage (I think)\r\n-- Might only be title
  case\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nT. Ross"

  body: No... although it's somewhat similar. It's much heavier and I think with more
    rounded corners. I feel like it's something that possibly would only have been
    used on posters or handbills originally.

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nOk, I don't know if it exactly fits - it hasn't exactly
    got rounded corners - but even if this is the wrong one, it's a doozy, so I'll
    post it anyway.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://isarsteve.de/blog/index.php?/archives/2006/10.html\">Deutsche
    Blockschrift</a> was not a font, but hand lettering used in the 1920's and 1930's.
    It's used in a bunch of the central subway stations in Berlin, most notably in
    a few old platforms at Alexanderplatz.\r\n\r\nI've always thought it definitely
    must have influenced Arno Drescher's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/drescher-grotesk-bt/familytree.html\">Grotesk</a>,
    which was also designed in the 30's. After WWII, the (only) East German type foundry
    <a href=\"http://pingmag.jp/2007/10/05/veb-typoart-the-east-german-type-betriebsstatte/\">VEB
    Typoart</a> continued producing Drescher Grotesk, also called Super Grotesk, and
    it became one of their bestsellers. \r\n\r\nAfter the Wall fell and VEB Typoart
    dissolved, Sven Smital from Berlin design collective eBoy (known for their elaborate
    pixel drawings) did a <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_super_grotesk/\">Super
    Grotesk revival</a> for FontFont.\r\n\r\nAlso interesting and German and partly
    from the 30's are the [[FF City Street Type]]s, although they're probably not
    what you're looking for. The East Berlin version has rounded corners, but it's
    from the 50's. \r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    I'm off on the 20s/30s era, or the German part... Grrr. I will try and find an
    example somehow...

    could find is [[http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/133c/133CwImages/DDR60sLuftBridgeMap600pxw.jpg|this

    poster edgeonyou shows? The text is from the communist East Germany in the beginning
    of the 60ies, Cold War started already. And in East Germany Super-Grotesk was
    the most common Grotesk after all old east german foundries were overtaken in
    VEB TypoArt. They had no access to lead types from West Germany in the following
    decades. \r\nHere is a sample of Super-Grotesk schmalfett (just scroll a little
