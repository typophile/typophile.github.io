  you guys thought of that broadcast design used this year. The presentation of categories
  animation were really nice i thought, all black and grey. \r\n\r\nAnd the hole screen
  above the stage that presented the categories and presenters. \r\n\r\nI was just
  feeling that the whole thing had a bit more class than last year with some very
  loud colors. \r\n\r\nYour turn\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    prominently</a> on last year's show, I thought the overall look this year was
    an improvement. Except for that Crash musical number. That was bizarre.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    yes, that was Franklin Gothic Condensed up there. Not quite sure if it was the
    original or the ITC version. My gut says ITC, but I'd have to look more closely.\r\n\r\n(To
    top it off, my cousin nabbed a statue this year.)"
