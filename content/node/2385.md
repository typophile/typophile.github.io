body: What&#39;s that so-called &#34;Soft Hyphen&#34; in slot 173 of the Windows codepage?  It&#39;s
  00AD in Unicode. It shows up in the MyFonts tables, as well as the Windows CharacterMap,
  but it behaves very funny in Word and WordPad, whether I enter it using the Alt-zero
  method or I do a copy-paste from the CharacterMap. Is it supposed to appear/disappear
  like that? And sometimes turn into two hyphens?! Where&#39;s the &#34;hard&#34;
  hyphen? The regular one breaks too. Is there one that doesn&#39;t? <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: A &#34;soft hyphen&#34; should indicate a place where a word would be hyphenated
    if and only if it crosses a line break, and be invisible otherwise. How well it
    is or isn&#39;t implemented in a given program is the murky part.

  body: That makes sense - it does only appear when it&#39;s end-of-line. I guess
    the point is to manually guide the hyphenation routine. The only little mystery
    is why Word <i>sometimes</i> subs two hyphens for it... <BR> <BR>And why is it
    missing from the MacRoman codepage? Doesn&#39;t Quark and stuff have bunches of
    different spaces and hyphens for textflow customization? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
