  with tools of graphic design.\r\nthis is an old idea i had.\r\nmy intention is to
  print this poster (100cm on 70cm),\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DEL1_5506.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
  then to puncture it like bullet holes (somewhat like this).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DEL2_5386.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
  then to take pictures of the punctured poster hung from above, just like in a shooting
  range.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DEL3_5247.jpg]\r\n\r\ntell me
  what do you think about the poster, the type, the idea, the kerning, etc..\r\nthank
  you."

  body: Print it out and fire a few rounds into it. If you have not any access to
    a gun you can always go to town on it with a sharp pencil. Take pictures between
    shots and then animate it for a web version; for a print version actually poke
    a ton of holes into the paper.

  body: "lundbocks & typedog - yea, this is exactly what i intended to do!! (perhaps
    it got lost between the photos). unfortunately going to the shooting range is
    way too expensive for me, so i think i will use a pencile with some charcoal dust
    arond it, so it will leave a tiny trail of dirt around the holes.\r\n\r\nthat
    web idea is awesome, Lunbocks!\r\n\r\nplease tell me how is the kerning, and the
    composition."

    time is a big issue here.\r\ni'm off to the printers!\r\ni will be very happy
    to hear more critiques.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/final_4568.jpg]\r\n\r\nbtw.
    i added an extra margin in order that there will be a \"frame\" to hold the paper
    after many punctures."

    range is expensive? I'm sure you can find a shooting range and ask them to fill
    your poster with holes. Paper target or paper poster, same difference. I don't
    think they will have a problem with that. ;)\r\n\r\n"

    two aspects:\r\n1. the design\r\n2. the message.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe message is  too
    far a way from the reality (e.g. End the .....Now). That said, the only one that
    you want to talk to is Abu Mazen -- Fatah.  What do you know about Hamas? Hamas
    - Iran? Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Joradn? "

    \ Either use a thicker pencil like the ones in kindergarden or fake it in PS.
    \ When bullets pass through the paper they leave a distinctive mark sort of like
    foot print if you will.\r\nYour on the right track comrade and you never answered
    my question, what typeface did you use?  Anyways good luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuerrizmo+Design\r\n"

  body: Puncture it with a pencil, or with the thick part of the pen, not only with
    the point. The holes you have now are far too small for any standard caliber rounds.
    Think 9 mm, .45, 7.62 mm, .223 or even 5.56 mm!
