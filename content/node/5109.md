  body: 'My absolute favorite is Real World InDesign. The new CS edition is just shipping
    in about a week &#40;Amazon lists availability in 11-12 days&#41;. It also seems
    to be the favorite reference of my fellow Adobe-ites. <BR> <BR>Now, depending
    on what your approach and background are, and what you are looking for, there
    may be another book that would also be good to have. But Real World InDesign is
    the indispensable reference, covering both how to do things, overall complex concepts,
    and very importantly &#42;why&#42; you would want to do &#40;or not do&#41; certain
    things. I&#39;ve had two copies of the ID2 version: one for the home, and one
    for the office. On those occasions when I need to do something or figure out some
    InDesign behavior I am not understanding, Real World InDesign has come through
    pretty much every time. <BR> <BR>On top of that it is very well written, being
    both clear and humorous while conveying complicated ideas. <BR> <BR>I hope that
    helps! <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T <BR> <BR>Thomas Phinney <BR>Program Manager

  body: I may now hijack this thread, but is the CS a must buy for 2.0 users?  <BR>I
    just designed my 1st book &#40;a novel&#41; with 2.0 and it looks OK.  <BR>My
    next book will include pictures and I wonder would I get any real benefit from
    switching to the CS? <BR>

  body: 'InDesign CS has a fair number of new features. Highlights are here: &#60;<a
    href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/newfeatures.html" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/newfeatures.html</a>&#62;
    <BR> <BR>A really big &#40;5.7 MB&#41; PDF listing new features is here: &#60;<a
    href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/pdfs/indesign_nfhs.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/pdfs/indesign_nfhs.pdf</a>&#62;
    <BR> <BR>However, the two biggest things in my opinion are fewer bugs, and significantly
    better performance. <BR> <BR>Also newly available is the &#34;PageMaker Plug-in
    Pack&#34; which adds some additiojnal features. &#60;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/pm_pack.html"

  body: '&#62;&#62;However, the two biggest things in my opinion are fewer bugs, and
    significantly better performance <BR> <BR>You&#39;re probably right. <BR>I&#39;ve
    worked for software companies quite a bit and they are almost always the biggest
    improvements in any new version. <BR>Its a shame that customers can&#39;t see
    the value in those improvements &#40;or that marketing departments can&#39;t see
    that customers <b>do</b> see the value...&#41; <BR>If only new versions could
    be marketed as <i>&#34;Less buggy and slow than the thing we sold you 2 years
    ago&#34;</i>, then there wouldn&#39;t be the need for so many new features, which
    end up introducing new bugs, and slowing the whole thing down again.'

  body: As someone trying to extend the usable life of my old blue&#43;white G3 &#40;450mhz/768MB
    RAM&#41;, would you imagine CS to be a net positive, or a negative compared to
    Indesign 2? I don&#39;t feel like I need the features &#40;and am wary of the
    lack of backwards compatibility&#41;, but is it really noticably faster/more stable?
    If Apple can do it with OSX, no reason Adobe can&#39;t, I suppose!
