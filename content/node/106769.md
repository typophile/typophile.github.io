  href=\"http://callanwolde.org\">Callanwolde Fine Arts Center</a> is a non profit
  located in Atlanta, Georgia. Quick summery is that the building is a historic mansion
  where we have we have 200 art classes and rent for weddings and events. I have a
  background in commercial photography and am a jr. designer. I am working on branding
  guidelines and a friend suggested I post here for font suggestions.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts
  would be appreciated. Looking for a good san serif heading font and serif body font
  that my staff will have on their newest version of Microsoft Office or we can get
  for free/minimal cost.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Callanwolde_Logo_Primary_500px_6302.jpg]"

    is available as an open source font I would recommend Open Baskerville.\r\n\r\nHave
    a look here - [[http://klepas.org/openbaskerville/]]\r\n\r\nHope that helps you.\r\n\r\nBest,"

  body: "I don't know anything about what sans come free with MS Office, but here
    are a few thoughts.\r\n\r\nI actually like the current logo. It would be nice
    if you took the main font (Celestia Antiqua?) and customized the distressed effect
    so that characters that repeat are different each time.\r\n\r\nYou could put the
    second line in spaced sans serif caps (Gotham? Neutraface? Scala or Seria sans?)
    so that it matches the width of the name, or is just slightly narrower. The ornament
    should either be distressed to match the main lettering, or \u2014 of the lower
    line becomes sans \u2014 it could stay clean. The positioning is a bit weird because
    it feels off-center. I would maybe use the type or the ornament, but not together
    (in different contexts) or do something else with the ornament."
