  (and inspiration!)\r\n\r\nI'm currently designing a, more or less, thematic font
  that I started 2 years ago but picked up recently again. My question is: What implication
  do rounded corners have on a font, I just got the idea to make the corners a little
  softer but i am not sure if it works or what is better or what fits better.\r\n\r\nI
  included a pdf to show you the differenc, which is only noticable at large corpses
  now I guess. I do think softer corners do look better on screen\r\n\r\n\r\nAny advice
  anyone?\r\n\r\n\r\n(P.S- this is the light weight of my font)"

    less sharp/angular on the page...\r\n\r\nI haven't printed your PDF, but the effect
    does seem to be extremely subtle... I think that whatever you're more comfortable
    with is fine.\r\n\r\nAs far as the face itself, it's hard to comment on; so far
    it seems very consistent\u2014perhaps even a little too much so (if there is such
    a thing). That is, all of the terminals and serifs are identical; I think it would
    be nice to introduce some variation, so that each character would appear to be
    a unique drawing made by the same \"pen.\" If nothing else, I think some alternates
    couldn't hurt.\r\n\r\nAlso, what is the intent of the font? I presume this is
    for display purposes; will there be a lower case?"

  body: "hi, thnx for the reply!\r\n\r\nThe whole font is basically my own font to
    use on business cards and other expressions of my own 'corporate identity' shall
    I say... or just for fun, no specific purpose (shame shame, that's not what i
    learned in school)\r\n\r\nThere will be: \r\n\r\n-lowercase, capitals, smallcaps,
    ligatures, oldstyle numerals, numerals, etc.\r\n-3 weights, light, medium & bold
    \r\n-roman version & cursive version of every weight.\r\n\r\n(then maybe stylistic
    alternates like swash... maybe a 'black' weight)\r\n\r\nMaybe I take consistency
    too serious? I think it's very important, but the terminals are actually different
    from the serifs. Look at the left top serif of the M, the terminal of the K, and
    the terminals of the T (or is that a seriph?) They are all different from the
    regular serif (look at the bottom of the F)\r\n"
