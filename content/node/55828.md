  body: "If you want true Greek fonts, it would be better to search for that term.
    If you want more fonts like Democratica that are 'twisted' Latin fonts, I would
    suggest Percolator, Envision, Solstice, Amplifier, Alembic, Missive, Gor, and
    NeoBold. There have been so many questions about fonts like this over the years,
    that I have written down the names on the page that shows Democratica.\r\n\r\nSorry
    but you will have to locate them, as I don't have links for them ready to use.\r\n\r\n-
