body: "First I'm not a professional in this area and I have only a limited task I
  need to accomplish so please bear with me.\r\n\r\nI need to replace glyphs with
  others in a font. For example, I need to change the Latin-B to a different glyph
  in the font.\r\n\r\nI've done this before, but it was done manually using a font
  editor and under Windows XP. Ive retried this in Windows 7 and something are much
  easier but Im still encountering problems. \r\n\r\nI used FontForge and took the
  glyph I wanted, and copied its reference, then pasted over the target I wanted to
  replace. This works pretty well. Later after I get one font I need to update all
  the fonts (bold, italic, etc) as well as other fonts but it looks like maybe I can
  use FontForge's scripting feature. FontForge crashes frequently though and often
  corrupts the font file as well :(\r\n\r\nThe problem is when I generate the font.
  TTF option causes Windows not to recognize it. So I use OpenType (CFF) and Windows
  sees it ok. But any time I use the font in 14pt or less, its really really fuzzy.
  Its not just as if cleartype isn't being used, but it is a really bad render. It
  looks like a resize of a bitmap font.\r\n\r\n1) Any ideas how to remedy this?\r\n\r\n2)
  Any suggestions besides FontForge that might accomplish this better?\r\n"
