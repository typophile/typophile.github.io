  people (especially typographer and type design) hate that font?\r\n\r\nIts just
  a font. I think the hater just have bit of envy of that font's popularity beside
  that's 'un-good' work. I think the worth of a font is reflected by people response
  instead the type designer. Because the consumer of the font is people, not the type
  design. People ignore design that ignores people."

  body: Because the font is ubiquitous (ships with the MS OS), it is often used utterly
    inappropriately. Alternately, you could assert that familiarity breeds contempt.
    Neither excuse has anything to do with the actual merits of the typeface, which
    is actually pretty decent and has its appropriate uses.

    useful for what it was intended. Most comic artists don't letter with sharpies!

  body: I sometimes used that font style because I find it nice to look at but why
    others hate it?I understand why others don't like that font because we have different
    perspective, styles and likes in our life so we cannot judge a person what he/she
    likes or hate.

  body: "I think another reason why it is hated is because often times, it is the
    first typeface that children/youth tend to jump to when they start writing on
    Word.  And when you have to read 60 papers, 80% of which are written in Comic
    Sans, you tend to develop a hatred towards it.  \r\n\r\nThe worst use of Comic
    Sans I have ever seen was when a university student handed in a research paper
    which was written in Comic Sans.  To make matters worse his paper was on Genocide
    in Africa; it was really hard to take him seriously when you have to read it in
    a joke font."
