body: "Hi typophile mates!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to improve this first version of this
  typeface, called \"Limonada\" its meaning is litteraly \"Lemonade\" and was sinesthetically
  referred as a formal abstraction to lemon shapes (i.e. lemon seed, lemon leaves,
  and lemon juice drop, etc.)\r\nThis weekend I'm very interested in make some correction
  on this one, so hope somebody can see it with another eye further than just mine
  ones and give me an opinion.\r\n\r\nI'll very thankful in advance.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nPedro\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Limonada_WIP-IX_4416.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Limonada_WIP-III_bn_5488.gif]\r\n\r\nP.S.:
