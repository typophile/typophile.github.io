  and will need to buy it, but first I need to know what it is... anyone? I appreciate
  any help you can give. The \"Happy Trails\" typeface is already known, it's just
  the fleuron ornaments I need. Oh, and if the horseshoes exist in a typeface, too,
  I'd love to know that as well.\r\n\r\nMany thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/happy_trails_fleuron_id_4644.jpg]"
