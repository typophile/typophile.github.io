  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everybody <BR> <BR>i have just started to redesign a logo  <BR>for a &quot;chateau&quot;. The company is very famous  <BR>in Greece for their hotel in an amazing landscape <BR>in Chalkidiki (northern Greece). Wine production  <BR>is a secondary activity of the company  <BR>and the &quot;chateau&quot; is placed in the same  <BR>landscape to the hotel. There is no need  <BR>to be a connection between the two -i just  <BR>mention the whole thing for the story. <BR> <BR>I tried to make the design as clearer i can,  <BR>though i kept all the basic shapes in the buildings  <BR>since i don't know how much i can omit. <BR> <BR>For the moment i prefer A though i am not sure  <BR>about the sizes (that's why A1 and A2). <BR> <BR>I am looking forward for comments about  <BR>the typography and the clarity of the design.  <BR>I was trying to find a good combination to make  <BR>a ligature but i couldn't see such a case.  <BR>If anybody have a suggestion on it i will be  <BR>very pleased to know. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance and have you all a nice day. <BR> <BR>christos <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39630.gif" alt="sign"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39631.gif" alt="proposals"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like very much the way that you have used the thinning lines to convey the landscape, but I wonder if the oval shape retained from the original isn't keeping the whole design somewhat rigid. Is that oval shape a requirement from the client? <BR> <BR>Otherwise, I don't like the versions with the borders around the image as I find that they make the design heavy. If pressed, however, I would prefer the borders in B, C, D and F because they mirror the lines in the image.  <BR> <BR>Generally I prefer the versions without the thin-thick line at the bottom as they are more open and welcoming, although the F and H are fun. My favourite example is G. <BR> <BR>I hope that these comments are helpful; I look forward to seeing the final decisions for this project.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christos, you have made an excellent mark. Of those that you show here I like A2. No border on the oval and the double rule below the type looks both fresh and modern to my eye but also provides a nice foundation for the type. <BR> <BR>In general the oval is very active and is eyecatching. I wonder if the buildings could be simplified, removing the window details and providing a calmer centre like the pupil in the iris of an eye. <BR> <BR>No matter what, your revision of this mark is a huge step forward for the chateau. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Christos, <BR> <BR>Don't get me wrong, I think the oval works as well. I like the play between the curve of the edge of the  <BR>oval and the various straight lines. Were it bothers me is in how the oval shape isolates the image  <BR>from the type. <BR> <BR>Maybe it is just me, but I would put the type aound the oval (like in the original) as that would unify the  <BR>two, however I didn't want to suggest that when I put up my first post (as I felt that it would not be  <BR>interesting for you to be too similar to the original) so I wondered about modifying the oval instead. <BR> <BR>By the way, I like the modifications you made; they have lightened everything up considerably. <BR> <BR>The Italics in III are to my taste; they go very well with the other elements. <BR> <BR>Just a question, what kind of applications will this have other than letterhead etc. Will this be on signs,  <BR>wine bottles, menus?  <BR> <BR>And best of luck to the Greek team today!

		<div class="commentbody">This design has progressed very nicely, terrific job Christos. From your last posting I prefer the logo (in the grouping of five with no type) that is in the middle. It has the sky (?, I thought it was more landscape) and the land on the left breaks out of the rectangle shape. to me, it makes the overall design more interesting and dynamic. As for the type I like the version on the left, with the swash K's. One thing that looks off to me is the swash k next to the cap T and then small caps for hma. I don't read Greek so I'm assuming that is gramitically correct, but how would it look with thma all in small caps?</div>
