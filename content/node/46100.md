  body: "I meant more something like [[http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/14107|this]],
    where fonts can be previewed en masse, with test text \u2014 like what Suitcase
    offers for installed fonts. I didn't know if there were preferred applications
    or widgets out there, or something secretly built into Tiger similar to what Leopard
    has with Quick Look.  \r\n\r\nBlah. I probably should have phrased that less <cite>how?</cite>
    and more <cite>what's the best way?</cite>"

  body: it's fairly easy in Leopard, as you've got the facility of coverflow (like
    with album artwork in iTunes) plus Quickview I think it's called.  Panther on
    the other hand, unless there's a piece of 3rd party software out there, I don't
    know of any other way that to click on the file to preview it prior to installing
    via Fontbook.  Actually does Panther come with Fontbook?  I only ever used Panther
    briefly before I upgraded to Tiger.  Sorry I can't be of more help.

  body: 'I think your answer is a [[font management software|font manager]]. The fonts
    viewed in Suitcase, FontAgent Pro, or FontExplorer X are not installed in the
    system. They are simply in a database accessible to the manager. '
