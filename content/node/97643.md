  is greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/x_3614.png]"

  body: "It's possible this is Korinna with added stroke, which would tend to round
    the serifs. Some cheap font collections rename the fonts and produce new weights
    in a similar way. For example, the old FontBank collection had a very heavy weight
    version of Korinna, but I don't recall the name they used.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: There is (was?) an extra-bold weight of Korinna, but this sample looks like
    it might have degraded through multiple stages of reproduction. Maybe somebody
    didn't have the original hard copy or file, so they scanned or photocopied a printed
    page, which made the letters spread a little. If you repeat this process a couple
    of times (a common practice in the pre-digital age), you get letters in a weight
    that doesn't match any existing design of the font. The rounded corners are usually
    a clue that this has happened.
