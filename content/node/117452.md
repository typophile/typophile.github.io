  panels, and i've never done this sort of large scale design before.\r\n\r\nEach
  panel will be around  4ft wide x 8ft tall \r\nwith around 200 words of text and
  a couple of images.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have to use the client's proprietary typeface (which
  is similar to Optima)\r\n\r\nAny tips?  Anything I should avoid as far as letter
  or line spacing? (beyond normal things like orphans, widows etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"

    the panels are designed for.

  body: Hrant's point is well taken - a 4 x 8 panel that you only can view up close
    is a real problem, even for the images. As I said, knowing the viewing distance
    is critical.

  body: "\r\nYeah, this is the puzzle - \r\n\r\nThe boards are part of 'kiosks' (9
    of them) for historic interpretation - the panels will be the kiosk 'backing',
    with key text and images on them. They will have tables/surfaces in front of them
    with more in depth information and interpretation (books, touchy-feely things,
    interactive tablet screens etc). So you are meant to go in close. Yet the panel
    is huge.\r\n\r\nDuring busy periods there is NO way you are going to be able to
    stand back to view them in the hallway/concourse where they are going to situated.
    You're going to be shuffling around and near them  like in a busy museum. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso
    let me correct - the panels will be 5.5ft high, 4ft wide (Overall is 8ft - 2.5ft
    is taken by the table height below them)"
