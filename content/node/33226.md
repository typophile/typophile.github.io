body: I need help identifying a typeface.  I put it through WhatTheFont and it closely
  matches <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olfranklin/extra-bold-regular/">OL
  Franklin Extra Bold Regular</a>, but it's not quite right.  For one thing the capital
  Cs do not match.  I am thinking it is either a different cut of Franklin Extra Bold
  or the designer did some tweaking.  Since this is a web graphic I am thinking the
  first option is the more likely one.
