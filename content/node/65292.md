  body: "Well, now I'm in the same boat. I have been looking for this every way I
    could think of to categorize it. The closest fonts i found were [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/quixley/|Quixley]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-alias/jackdaw/|Jackdaw]], but neither of
    them is especially close. (In case you cared about 'Santa Fe' that is Ray Larabie's
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/deftone/|Deftone]], with some grungifying).\r\n\r\nBecause
    this has the look of a freebie, I spent a lot of time first at Dafont looking
    for categories I thought would cover the style, but I couldn't find it. Partly,
    this is maddening because I think it looks familiar. \r\n\r\nMaybe this post will
    prompt someone else to get aboard? \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Austin, I know you don't post here often, but it does help if you give a
    more descriptive title for your post. \"Informal Uneven Sans Taqueria\", for example,
    would have clued in folks who know more about that style of font, and Taqueria
    would be a key word I would remember if I found the answer, but wanted to find
    this thread again. You can edit the thread title, since you were the one who posted
    it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
