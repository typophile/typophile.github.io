    I don't know what it is yet, but when they get it, it will be big."

    secret.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree that Twitter is missing something. I think it's best
    implementation is when Twitter updates run inline with Facebook \"updates.\""

  body: I've found that you MUST have the interface right there waiting for you, like
    Twitterific that Grant and I use. There are various other interfaces out there,
    but yeah, just get one that will sit there on your desktop ready to go or else
    you won't use it.
