  body: BTW I received the new House Industries catalogue today <BR>featuring the
    <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=SHAG-FO" target="_blank"> Shag Collection</a>
    &#40;the Brits must be laughing  <BR>their arses off, heh&#41;. These guys sure
    know how to sell  <BR>their fonts. Well-designed, full colour, featuring exhaustive  <BR>samples,
    fun illustrations and design examples. Nice...
