  body: "It looks like Stymie Extra Bold or Memphis Extra Bold but it's not a match,
    the c is distinct.\r\n\r\nMy bet is that it\u2019s a commissioned job like Matthew
    Carter's new Cheltenham for the same newspaper."

  body: "Yes, since normal stymie has a 2-story a.\r\n\r\nI think all the Times fonts
    are custom/proprietary.\r\n\r\nBeton is similar too."
