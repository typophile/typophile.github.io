body: OK. I&#39;m  moron. What the heck typeface is this? I see it every day on the
  bus. It&#39;s covering the construction fence at the site of the new Minneapolis
  downtown library. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m guessing this will take somebody about 2 seconds....
  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a webpage with some pictures of the construction site.  <BR>

  <BR> <BR>Anyone know who designed this and/or the story behind the signage? I enjoy
  looking at it every day! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27630.jpg"
