  body: "Italics? In a typewriter font?\r\n\r\nDo you want these to be something like
    the cursive font that was on some IBM ball typewriters? Or just a slanted version
    of the roman, which you could make yourself?\r\n\r\nOr do you not really mean
    a \"typewriter\" font? Would any monospaced font with a light weight and italics
    work?"

  body: "Either type of italics is fine, but I don't know how to make them for myself.
    And I mean a monospaced serif font like Courier New, not a sans-serif code font.
    \r\n\r\nSans Mono Condensed is all right, but I would prefer a font that keeps
    the serifs in the italic version. It could be just slanted, or it could be different,
    like CMU Typewriter. If that font was narrower and lighter it would be perfect. "

  body: Letter Gothic is okay, but something with more serifs like Courier New is
    what I'm looking for. I really don't think I'm going to find anything, but that's
    all right. Thanks everyone for trying.

  body: "\"If that font was narrower and lighter it would be perfect.\"\r\n\r\nmonospaced
    fonts are made to a single width that all glyphs can survive on. That single width
    is a compromise allowing the m to condense and the i to expand while just maintaining
    marginal readability. \r\n\r\nso what you are asking for doesn't exist, (with
    multiple weights and italics),  for a reason. you are in luck though\u2014 Courier
    condensed can be simulated on just about any desktop computer for free, so you
    can see."

    Inconsolata (that I like) and Letter Gothic (at least the CTAN version).\r\n\r\nThere
    is a mono script also having width 0.35em,  Script Mono Condensed, available from

    needs bigger dots almost anyone can fix. "
