  the New York Times between 1920-1934 to report Yankees news. I'm not sure if there
  was any difference between sports news and other news, so I thought I'd better be
  specific. I've found various references to changes in typefaces used over the years,
  but am unable to confirm the above date range. I suspect Morris Fuller Benton's
  Cheltenham of 1906 might still have been in use for text or headline, but I'm not
  sure it would have been used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFor future reference, has
  anyone put together or know of a full history of New York Times typefaces from the
  inception of the paper to present? (Perhaps a chart?) I have captured some pieces
  of it from various articles and sources, but never seem to have just what is needed!\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

    you seek, but out of curiosity I downloaded an article about the Yankees from
    the June 18, 1925, NYT to see what I could see.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/YankeesNYT1925_5688.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    headline seems to be a version of Latin, which began life as wood type in about
    1860. There are digital versions:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/latin/\r\n\r\nThe
    article also includes three subheads in what looks to be Alternate Gothic or something
    similar (in the last subhead, a homer by Lou Gehrig is mentioned as preventing
    a shut-out). \r\n\r\nThe reproduction is so poor and the body text so small I
    can't get a clear enough image to ID it."

  body: "Thank you for your response!\r\n\r\nApparently, the Times has had a reputation
    of being slow to change - and probably for good reason. It seems whenever a change
    is made (and even small ones), newspapers somehow lose subscribers. It seems not
    all of us humans embrace change! Using a wood type lettering into the later 1920's
    is therefore not surprising.\r\n\r\nWhile not my original question, the large
    number and variety of typefaces used is intriguing: text, headers, sections, headlines,
    masthead, section titles (and probably more). Is it possible the variety was designed
    to speed the typesetters in their efforts? "

  body: "Kurt, I don't think the variety of typefaces was intentional, but a gradual
    evolution as printing developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\r\n\r\nMy
    great-grandfather and grandfather were both newspaper publishers and commercial
    printers. They followed the conventions of their respective eras (which spanned
    1870\u20131960) when it came to buying and setting type. Contrast between headlines
    and text--both in size and type style--was a given, and subheads were usually
    in yet another style, often a sans serif, for additional emphasis and differentiation.\r\n\r\nCold
    metal and wood type weren't exactly cheap, and you spent the majority of your
    budget on text sizes. If you splurged for display fonts, you chose carefully and
    used them whenever you could. Hot metal type casting (which cast complete lines
    of type) used matrices that also weren't cheap, so even as styles changed you
    tended to mix the old with the new.\r\n\r\nAt a large paper like the New York
    Times, the work was so segmented by section of the paper that each developed its
    own distinctive typographic quirks over time, with only the text and major headline
    styles remaining constant across all sections.\r\n"

    be lost. \r\n\r\nIt is beginning to sound like an historical record of Times typography
    might not be available. To accomplish my immediate mission, it sounds like I need
    to find some related articles in their archives and work to identify the type
    from there. (However, I might still try to contact the Times...)"

  body: Thanks again! I had found the discussion of the nameplate, but had only seen
    condensations of the other article. The full text is very helpful and I think
    perhaps the most detailed single piece on various typefaces used by the Times
    --and it even offers up some names who might be able to shed further light on
    the subject...
