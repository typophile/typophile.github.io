  the leap to ask a question to you pro's.\r\n\r\nI am designing a catalogue system
  (think fancy auction catalogue) for print, web and large poster design. For the
  web I have been working with Franklin Gothic Condensed Book and Medium for headings,
  and Georgia for bread text. I was trying this for a large poster and for a book
  layout and all of a sudden felt that I should look elsewhere. Based on a discussion
  here I found Whitney and Chronicle Text(which I like better than Miller) but ouch
  they are expensive! I am trying to determine whether it is worth it and also if
  they work for every medium and sizes I am working with... I do want consistency.\r\n\r\nSo
  my questions:\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons that I like Whitney is the old style numerics,
  which I have not been able to find in Franklin Gothic. Are there no such numbers
  in Franklin Gothic that I can use? \r\n\r\nWill Georgia work for a large typographic
  poster (set in 30 pt) or will that look retarded?\r\n\r\nIs there a way I can purchase
  some single styles of Whitney, say Whitney Condensed Book and Medium, and still
  get the old style numerics? I am also very interested in the Index White Square
  Bold and Black Round Bold...\r\n\r\nWill Whitney/Chronicle work on the web, has
  someone successfully embedded them? \r\n\r\nI wish I could buy them both but that
  means $1000...\r\n\r\nThankful for any advice!\r\n\r\nS\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your comments! I did read about the restrictions regarding use
    on the web, which maybe makes it impossible for me to use H&FJ fonts... You also
    cannot buy single styles from them, but I did email them to see if I could get
    an educational discount (as I am an academic)...\r\n\r\nI am driving myself crazy
    here... I like the numerals of FF Dagny a lot, but want a condensed style. I just
    love Whitney, it has so much I need... \r\n\r\nI am also struggling with the bread
    text. Tried to set Minion for print, and it looked better, but don't know if it
    works with Franklin Gothic? I do like Miller, but not the numerals, especially
    the \"1\" look strange to me. But those forms contrast nicely to Whitney.\r\n\r\nI
    would right now love to have the full Whitney set and the full Miller set!\r\n\r\nOk,
    rambling. Thanks again for your help, and I might submit my design up for critique
    once done!\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nS"

  body: "Sara -- Thanks for your compliments. \r\n\r\nThe late [[http://typophile.com/user/7891|Will
    Powers]] used to like pairing Whitman with Franklin Gothics in books he produced
    for the Minnesota Historical Society Press. \r\n\r\nRegarding poetry: \r\n[[http://typophile.com/user/23726|Nicola
    Caleffi]] used Whitman in an Italian book of poetry -- <em>Ombre di Luce</em>
    by Graziana Bernabei [Sassuolo (Modena): Incontri Editrice, 2009] \r\n\r\n[[http://www.chapiteau.org/|Chapiteau
    Press]] (in Vermont) used a pre-release version of Whitman, back in 2002, for
    a small chapbook of poetry by Ilya Kaminsky called <em>Musica Humana</em>.\r\n\r\nWhitman
    is also the primary text face for <em>[[http://www.vqronline.org/|The Virginia
    Quarterly Review]]</em> and is used for setting poetry as well as articles, I
    believe.\r\n\r\nRegarding cataloging systems: I'm not sure what to tell you there.
    Perhaps someone else can offer an example that I'm unaware of."

  body: "Dear Kent, \r\n\r\nThank you so much! I will take a look at those books.
    I downloaded the Whitman specs from your website, that was very helpful, especially
    the note on dashes and special punctuation. I have been looking for an alternative
    to Scala for quite some time, and think this is it! I am super excited.\r\n\r\nNow
    after looking around some more, I realize that Verlag is a better fit for me than
    Whitney or Franklin Gothic. I love the numerals and it seems less corporate than
    Whitney. Do you think it will fit well with Whitman?\r\n\r\nA problem I have is
    that I love the Whitney Index family, and Verlag doesn't come with anything similar,
    I think! I guess it will be a big mistake to mix Whitney Index and Verlag, but
    this would give me what I need:\r\n\r\nHeading/ wall text/ motion graphics: Verlag
    Condensed family\r\nIndex: Whitney Index Family\r\nBread (print and web): Whitman\r\n\r\nA
    note on the context: I am designing an artist book that uses the format of an
    auction catalog. I am inventing a numbering system, and there will be short descriptions
    for each item. It will accompany an exhibition that uses wall text, which is why
    I want a museum style typeface. This multimedia exhibition also includes film,
    and I would love to also use Verlag in the titles. To make things more complicated
    for myself, I am also creating a version of the catalog for the web. I would love
    to be able to use the same typefaces, and to get a a more traditional print design
    feel on the web!\r\n\r\nSo, my convoluted question is now moving into the web
    design sphere:\r\n\r\nThere are two possibilities to make \"rare\" typefaces appear
    on the computer screen :\r\n\r\nsIFR (Scalable Inman Flash Replacement) - H&FJ
    demand that you buy another license for your server to use this\r\n\r\n@font-face
    tag within Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) - H&FJ doesn't allow you to use their
    fonts for this.\r\n\r\nThere is another option, which is to use static text in
    Flash, but this is not ideal from a web design point of view.\r\n\r\nHas anyone
    used Verlag and Whitman in a web context successfully? Do you need to buy an extra
    license to use sIFR with Whitman, and can you use CSS?\r\n\r\nI do understand
    if people are too involved in their holiday shopping to follow my train of thought
    here...\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nSara\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sara --\r\n\r\nI can't think of any specific uses of Whitman with Verlag,
    off the top of my head, but I have always thought they'd be potentially compatible.\r\n\r\nYou
    will need to speak directly with Font Bureau regarding licensing Whitman for sIFR
    usage. I do not know the specific policy. Contact Harry Parker at hparker [at]
    fontbureau [dot] com. Or call the main FB phone number to discuss in person. \r\n\r\nI
    do know that, right now, CSS @font-face \"embedding\" is not allowable with Font
    Bureau retail fonts. FB has said that they are working on a web fonts licensing
    framework for their library. I would expect more details to emerge in the coming
    months. \r\n\r\n-- K."
