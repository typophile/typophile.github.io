  body: "Oddly enough, I have been working on a font inspired by those same cheesy
    postcards, although it more closely resembles Futura Display on steroids. I've
    been dragging my feet finishing it, because I think there's probably a pretty
    limited demand for this kind of thing.\r\n\r\nHere's what it looks like so far...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Souvenir-Postcard_6583.gif]\r\n\r\nAnother
    of my fonts that might be useful for the same purpose, and <em>is</em> actually
    finished, is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/jampact-nf/\" target=\"_blank\">Jampact</a>."

  body: "Nice work, NIck! I think there's always demand for legible display fonts
    that are as black as possible. \r\n\r\nThe 'C' and 'G' could use even more steroids.
    The 'F' is too narrow."
