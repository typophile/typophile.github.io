  anybody know what font is used in the opening credits of the \"Charmed\" TV series?\r\n\r\nVideo
  of the opening sequence at this link:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0Yq8hATWwo|Charmed
  Season 8 Title Theme]]\r\n\r\nThe font is used for the initial \"CHARMED\" at the
  beginning of the sequence, then used for all the actors' names.\r\n\r\nI've searched
  on and off for years and have always come up empty. Tried Identifont, no match.\r\n\r\nAny
  and all information would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks!"

    near the end.\r\n\r\nEvery other text in the title theme is one different font
    which is the one I'm trying to identify."

    tough to find online and I don't think it's for sale. Bummer. I did find a standard
    ABCDE sample sheet but it's probably frowned upon to link to that? Anyway I'm
    sure you can google at least that much."

    illegal clones frowning will be moderate."
