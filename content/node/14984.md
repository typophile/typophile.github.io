body: "Antecedent was developed over the past year for my MA degree at Surrey Institute
  of art and design. The family consists of two sets, one for the screen and one for
  the print. The idea was to tweak the design but maintain the characteristics of
  the design so both would be seen as one typeface. The most significant change would
  be the xHeight and tracking.\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate any feedback anyone
  has to give on the ideas I have set forth as well as the design itself. I am looking
  for feedback for my Critical Exposition class this term. I have set up a temporary
  site with the theory and background information for this design at http://www.e3type.com\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJim"

  body: "I think the idea is smart, as it aknowledges the \"fatal\" limits of WYSIWYG.\r\n\r\nI'd
    like to see:\r\n- the screen cut mapped to the grid better; it's too blurry.\r\n-
    the details in the print cut; a much larger sample please.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Hello,\r\nThanks for the reply. I have uploaded a larger image. If it would
      help, I could upload the typeface itself for you to check. I have designed three
      weights for each screen and print.\r\nJim"

  body: I really like the typeafce you have created and think you are on to something
    great with this. It is very easy to read and shows a very distinct style that
    many typefaces lack.
