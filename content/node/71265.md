  body: "Bank Gothic is, as its name suggests, a conservative style of sans serif.\r\nEven
    though published in 1930, widely interpreted as an art deco face and oft compared
    with the genuinely modernist City, it is a late 19th century throwback style,
    as attested by the narrow centre stroke of E, the diagonally chamfered terminals
    of the \"rounded\" letters, and its lack of a lower case.\r\nSo a good text face
    to complete an authentic retro look would be another Benton revival of a vertically
    stressed \"geometric\" style, Bodoni, or one of his Centuries."

  body: Thanks. Bodoni is too hard to work with for so much text. I'll try Century
    Schoolbook. Not sure it's the cutting edge geometric look my boss was going for...but
    he wants to use Bank Gothic because it's squarish and I'm at a loss of what to
    go with that. Using a serif by the same designer makes sense. Can authentic retro
    be cutting edge?

  body: "Honestly, Bank Gothic hasn't been cutting edge for a while. :-\\\r\n\r\nYou
    could try pairing not historically but stylistically, meaning looking for something
    squarish and with relatively low contrast, but fresher / newer? \r\n(I can't think
    of actual fonts to suggest right now \u2013 sorry.)"

  body: "Frankly, there is no serif face that will redeem BG into a contemporary look
    for an annual report, unless the layout is real wacky.\r\nAs Kent has demonstrated,
    the effect is dreary, in a Dodge Reliant kind of way.\r\n\r\nBetter to go with
    a contemporary sans, light in tone. Gotham would work well, with its wide, big-x
    look. More Plymouth Fury..."

  body: Thanks for all your suggestions. I'm going with Melior for text type. When
    William suggested it, I thought he meant in place of BG. I realize now he meant
    pairing it with BG. (I know, my brain is fried over this typeface issue.) Unfortunately,
    the other suggested fonts did not fit my budget. I don't know exactly what vintage
    car Melior and BG make but I'm driving it. I'm using BG light condensed, which
    I find less objectionable than the other weights, and using it sparingly. The
    layout is NOT wacky. That wouldn't work. But I am trying to make it as acceptable
    as I can given what I have to work with. Sometimes that's all we can do.
