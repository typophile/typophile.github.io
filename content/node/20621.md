  the client thought it was too hard to read.\r\n\r\nSo I found this one, \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/cezanne-regular/\r\nand
  my boss said \r\n\"I think if they found the other font hard to read, they\u2019ll
  find this one even harder to read. I think you\u2019re looking for a somewhat similar
  script that is not as slanted. This one is slanting in all directions and it\u2019s
  funky enough that I think it loses the old-style character. That\u2019s just subjective
  stuff. But I do know they would find this even harder to read.\"\r\n\r\nI also tried\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=jefferson\r\nand

    body: I find that if you want to use a script, it's best to write the text out
      yourself and scan it. This adds much more personality and feels less mechanical.
      You can also make it as legible as you like.

    Dear Sarah Pro </a> - it''s absolutely gorgeous. There is also <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000164">
    Cenizas </a>. But using these fonts depends a lot on how much text needs to be
    set and at what size, like most scriptfaces. '
