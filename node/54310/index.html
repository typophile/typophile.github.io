I'm assuming this is Meridien. Please correct me if it isn't.

The typography and typeface used really have me struggling to read this book. These sharp serifs alternately pinch me in the eye, or seem to disappear into the paper; the type seems distracting, and it feels too light. But maybe that's just me.

I'd appreciate to hear your opinions on what you think about Meridien for books – immersive reading, novel type stuff. (And if it "isn't just me", I'd appreciate some good reasoning why the above might not be optimal; I might need (OK, want) to steer a client into a different direction.)

Cheers!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can't tell how your example was printed, but when I think of too-light fonts from that era my suspicions go to a design intended for letterpress printed otherwise. I read that Frutiger developed Meridien for Lumitype but also had a metal version cut at the same time. Maybe the design is accordingly a compromise? 

In those eras of overlapping printing technology, when fonts were released simultaneously in multiple formats, were they adapted accordingly or more often executed from the same drawings blindly?</div>

The x-height didn't occur to me, but it really looks quite huge.

Craig, I was suspecting some influence of a printing technology shift too. I presume this is standard offset printing from digital, and the type does feel quite fragile. (Though maybe that's just me preferring sturdier/darker types.)

Jörg: The "f" is slowing me down too. And I stumble at every "a" (does it feel wide? Or maybe it's the top drooping down).

		<div class="commentbody">Oh, that's right. And Frutiger Serif seems to be closer to the original metal Meridien (see page linked to below).

"Linotype’s Type Director, Akira Kobayashi, began by returning to prints made from the original metal type version of Meridien. In his opinion, the phototype and digital versions had been drawn too wide; the original phototype and digital Meridien had been optimized for 10–12 point text, but even these sizes are not really small enough! A typeface named Frutiger Serif would have to be able to function in smaller sizes, too."

		<div class="commentbody">I have never liked Meridien. For a start, it always looked unpleasantly spikey to me, as it does to Nina. Looking at the interesting link to Linotype, I think it was also the width. Even the new Frutiger Serif, while distinctly better, for me still doesn't work. There is still something off about the rhythm of it. 

As to the x-height, I also think it is too big for a book face, but for other uses, such as tightly packed narrow columns, it might work.

It is interesting to compare this with Rocky, which is also a very spikey face, but works beautifully, in my eyes. I think it is because Carter varies the weights of the spikes well.  

IIRC John Hudson has written that he's an admirer of Meridien, so perhaps he'll come on this thread and tell us of its virtues.

Sounds like classic post-rationlization. They didn't want to reduce the x-height, but realized it's only useful small when it's loose (display when it's tight), but found a funny way to admit it.

> I think the x height wouldn’t be an issue if it wasn’t for the sharpness and thinness of the fonts.

On the contrary, vertical proportions are at the heart of reading.

BTW, another admirer of Meridien is actually Carter.

I'm guessing that came with trying to make it "Frutiger Serif"? At least the x-height vs. cap height ratio seems compatible:

Nina, in that setting the x-heights are indeed the same, but thanks to a much smaller talus* Frutiger Serif in fact has a smaller relative x-height. However, it needs more leading, so people might end up setting it smaller (a good thing here) so the two become closer in a way. What's very useful though is that they seem to have equalized the apparent sizes of the two fonts (at the same point size). Maybe this is something Adrian Frutiger did originally? It's difficult to give Kobayashi too much credit however.

* Also called internal leading.

BTW, I'm glad you liked that page of mine. Just to be crystal: the blurring I show there isn't of course exactly the sort of thing the eye sees, it's a... dramatization if you will. Nonetheless, I believe it's a useful parallel to how vision works.

Of course. I'm guessing it would be (near) impossible both technologically and practically to re-create exactly the sort of blurring that's happening in parafoveal vision. What you did is a normal Gaussian blur or something, right?

<em>"a must-have book for the true blue typophile"</em>
There are too many of those. Need to buy a new bookshelf :)

Talus is not a common term; but there are no common terms for the empty space above the ascenders and below the descenders, even though it's a very important part of a font. "Internal leading" is clunky and potentially confusing. Sometimes you need a fresh term to make a clean break, and talus (which I didn't make up myself) fits the bill for me. And it doesn't hurt that it sounds classy.  :-)

		<div class="commentbody">Getting back to Meridien: the importance of the x-height becomes quite clear 
when things are blurred (Patria on the right for comparison). This was a pretty illuminating exercise, if very quick and dirty – and a bit unfair too, as the original sample is scanned (I don't have Meridien).

Looking at this comparison, apart from the short ascenders*, I'd call the designs of Meridien's "e" and "t" somewhat problematic/unclear (and maybe the tittle too?).

* Come to think of it, I should have picked a word with descenders too. Oh well.

		<div class="commentbody">Of color, proportions and spacing the last can indeed be tweaked during typesetting, but I do say tweaked because there are "boundary conditions" to worry about, and if you go too far problems will start raining on you. Think about the right side of "r" for instance: the right sidebearing will typically be very close to flush against the glyph, so if you track the font tighter, things -like the left serif of the "v"- will start colliding with the beak; and if you track the font looser you don't actually want the right sidebearing to increase, because the type designer was fighting the whitespace to begin with. One thing that tends to help though is InDesign's optical spacing.

Got your point, Hrant. But you still need to do it sometimes (tracking, that is); say, how about when you need to set a very well spaced font a bit smaller than it was intended to be; or knock it out of a solid color? Would that be Bad, and better to pick a different font instead?

James, the sample I posted is an inch and three quarters wide. <a href="http://altaira.de/posted/meridien_pfarrer.gif">Here</a> is a shot of an entire page (no margins, sorry); the whole column is just short of 4 inches wide.
I agree about the tracking; I may be hallucinating, but to me it also seems to vary too much (this being justified text with possibly weird settings). Actually, in some places, the letterspacing looks a bit wonky to me too (like that "llbl" sequence in "Hüllblättern" – the second "l" looks a hair too close to the "b" to me, and that's actually a delimiter between two distinct parts of a compound, so if anything, it should be looser rather than tighter IMHO).</div>

Agreed. I was taught this during my first internship, and felt like I held 
The Key To The Kingdom of smartly setting type (and saving a couple of lines
in the process) for the following year or so, until I realized it makes things look… bad.

Still: If you say a given typeface is only really optimized for a pretty narrow range of point sizes, what am I (as a typographer, in this instance) supposed to do if I 
do need to set it smaller? – Given that I wouldn't just automatically track it out & let it be, but go through it by hand afterwards to make sure no weirdness is happening? Still better to just not do it?</div>

While I also think there might be something a little off about the fitting of Meridien (or perhaps its just this particular setting), I have to say that this discrepancy you point out in "Hüllblättern" is actually something that I suspect you'll find in most fonts (although, perhaps to a lesser degree).

In a typical serif font, the left sidebearing of a <em>b</em> will be less than that of <em>h k l</em> to account for the lack of foot serif -- I would say 80&#150;85% would not be uncommon. In most combinations, this difference is necessary to get good fitting. The only circumstance where you're likely to notice the discrepancy in ascender intervals is in the sequences "llb" or "dlb." I don't know how common "llb" is in German; I would imagine "dlb" doesn't exist in the wild.

Including a "lb" positive kern pair in a font is probably a pretty rare thing.

Just thought I'd point that out.

Of course German is a bit evil about possible letter sequences – we can make all sorts of weird ones by way of compounds. It took me a moment to think of one with "dlb", and this may really be reaching out too far, but in Austrian dialect (which would rarely be <em>written</em> though), "Ma<strong>dl</strong>" means "girl" (scary image <a href="http://hitparade.ch/cdimages/ursprung_buam-a_fesches_boarisches_madl_a.jpg">here</a>); so compounds with that and a "<strong>b</strong>"-Word like "Beine" (legs), or its Austrian equivalent, would be possible.</div>

Back to Meridien: Looking more closely at the full scan you linked to (and spending time I really shouldn't be ;-), I have come to the conclusion that there is something definitely funky going on with the fitting of this setting.

Since the sorts of weirdness I'm seeing are what I would consider amateurish inconsistencies (especially in terms of straights vs. rounds), and since Frutiger and Linotype are not amateurs, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that this book was set with Adobe InDesign's Optical metrics applied.

Nina, is this a recent enough publication where this could be a possibility?

Without testing with Meridien itself to replicate the exact same idiosyncrasies and confirm (I don't have Meridien), I can't be absolutely certain, of course. But I have seen Adobe's Optical metrics do this sort of destruction before -- things like pushing out straight-straights and arch-straights, pulling in arch-rounds; it will even exacerbate the "llb" irregularity. 

(I've seen Whitman used with Optical metrics, and at first I was suddenly plagued with self-doubt and thought I was going crazy.)

The more I think about this, the more convinced I am about this theory.

Parents: Please, don't let your kids use Optical metrics! Please!

Ha! That might explain a lot. And yes, the book was published in 2008.
I have contact info for the graphic designer who typeset this, but am a bit reluctant to contact him about this and ask directly, as I'm doing the next book in this edition, which could (maybe should) have been his job… no need to make him feel bad about the job he did I guess.

Anybody reading this thread who has a bit too much time, and has Meridien (and InDesign), to do a quick test setting of maybe a couple of lines with metrics vs. optical? I'm intrigued.

<em>"Parents: Please, don’t let your kids use Optical metrics!"</em>
Doesn't that kind of depend on the font used (& how well it was originally spaced), though? (Smelling the next tangent. :-) )

<em>"The next tangent I’d like to see this thread take are examples of Meridien set well."</em>
That would actually be a tangent that's pretty close to the original core of the thread (which I agree is pretty ADD-ish. Much fun).</div>

Wouldn't that make the whole thing much tighter?* Although I know there are limits to how far InDesign will deviate from the built-in spacing, and Meridien is loose to start with.

But Kent, many fonts are so poorly spaced that it <em>can</em> help.
Optical spacing is just another tool that can be used well or poorly.

Or simply that it has regained its youthful vigor, at least here and now.
Frankly though this degree is divergence is nothing compared to past cases.

Sure, why not!  :-/
In fact when I tested out InDesign's optical spacing back when,
I realized that it doesn't take into account the tracking setting,
which can backfire in a big way.

I will admit I am not at all a fan of Optical metrics (in Adobe's implementation), except for perhaps a very few, limited circumstances. In my opinion, it should never be used for text settings (certainly not books). Maybe it can improve poor spacing to become mediocre. I've never seen it produce decent spacing overall; and I've never seen it improve spacing to the point where it is acceptable for book text. 

But maybe that's because I would never consider trying to use something for the sort of work I do that was poorly spaced to begin with.

<cite> > Optical spacing is just another tool that can be used well or poorly.</cite>

Mostly poorly. It's a reckless tool. No controls. Which is why I generally advise against it. If you don't have the discernment to evaluate the results, don't use it. (If you do have the discernment, then what are you doing working with a poorly spaced font in the first place.)

Sorry, is my cranky side showing? ;-)

<cite> > Wouldn’t that make the whole thing much tighter?</cite>

In my explorations, it doesn't necessarily tighten text settings. Display, yes. But not text size. Mostly it just shifts space around. Seems like it puts in as many positive kerns as it does negative ones. (Like straight-straights on the order of 15&#150;35 units).

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, again waaay too much time spent. But what's done is done. I post this in the hopes it continues to be instructive.

Naturally, I've selected a particularly egregious example in order to strengthen my point. ;-)

Here is an example of Adobe InDesign's Optical metrics applied to 10 pt Trump Mediaeval. I'm not claiming that TM's spacing is exemplary (though certainly reasonable), but what InDesign does to it is my focus. Also, this particular example seems to exhibit a similar strategy to what I perceive going on in the Meridien sample -- probably because Trump Mediaeval shares some characteristics with Meridien, in particular the long sharp serifs.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OptMet_TM-10_3595.png]

&nbsp;
The top is the natural fitting. Beneath that is the Optical treatment. Below that is an annotation showing the numerical adjustments that InDesign is applying. Note how it pushes apart the straights and pulls together the straight-rounds, creating an uneven spacing -- E i n bi ldu n g.

At 12 pt, the numbers are different, but the basic strategy is similar:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OptMet_TM-12_4028.png]

&nbsp;
If you look at Nina's full Meridien page, you'll find this same word seven lines up from the bottom:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Merid_Ein-excerpt_5421.png]

This exhibits the same odd fitting quirks.

Compare this with what I must assume is Meridien's natural fitting from the Linotype tester:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Merid_Einbildung_6337.png]

&nbsp;
We can argue about whether the natural fitting of Meridien is too loose for text or not, or about the effect of various other design attributes on readability. But I hope we can agree that something funky is happening with the fitting in that example, and I'm pretty sure Adobe Optical metrics is the culprit.

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, that wasn't just educational, I'd say illuminating! And it looks like you're right on the money about your optical spacing suspicion. 
Here's the word from the scan compared with the sample you posted from the Linotype site (or was that MyFonts? In any case, I'd hope they have kerning activated in their Flash).
I tried to scale the two to the same size, though that wasn't quite easy (sorry, my scanner sucks).

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spacing_meridien_5674.jpg]

This shows a remarkably similar pattern to what you posted, Kent (with the notable exception of n_g).
The crazy thing is, while the word obviously got quite a bit looser overall, there are some pairs that still got tighter (in absolute terms) – those being mainly round/straights (b_i, l_d) – whereas straight/straights like i_n and i_l got looser. 
Could this be a case in point for a combination of optical scaling plus tracking? 

(I'm getting the creeping impression somebody was consciously trying to wreck the spacing on this one. :-/ )

It was in fact the Linotype site.

One useful thing about using Trump as an example is that, since it was originally designed for Linotype composition, it has very few kerning pairs. (Metal Linotype, you may know, could not accommodate any kerns at all). There are none in this sequence. So the values I list can be taken as absolute, no need for math.

I would suspect the same is true for Meridien. So, it wouldn't matter whether the tester could accommodate kerning, since there probably isn't any.

In fact, I would say that in any reasonably competent text font, this particular sequence -- E i n b i l d u n g -- should not require any kerning pairs. 

<cite> > This shows a remarkably similar pattern to what you posted, Kent (with the notable exception of n_g).</cite>

This is undoubtedly due to the different structures of the lower bowl, Trump having a horizontal left thrust & Meridien having a demur angle.

<cite> > Could this be a case in point for a combination of optical scaling plus tracking? </cite>

No. This is a case in point for leaving it alone and not using optical metrics.

--

1) The optical spacing algorythm seems to apply the same pattern Kent outlined above to serif fonts, across different fonts and sizes. Note the sequence "bild", which by opening up the straight/straights and tightening the straight/rounds (and vice versa) ends up as something closer to "bi ld".

Here's Swift at 10pt (top "Metrics"; bottom "Optical"). To my eyes, the beautiful visual rythm is completely thrown off by optical spacing.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/swift_5415.gif]
More or less the same thing happening to Dante at 12pt (a pretty extreme case of "bi ld"):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dante_6687.gif]

--

2) To find out about the assumption that optical spacing can be beneficial for the special case of badly spaced fonts, I did a test with the most badly spaced font I have, which is my own work in progress – I actually haven't worked on its spacing yet, there's just something kind of there.
Again, InDesign applies a similar pattern as on the serif fonts above – and even here, I'm not sure the "optical" version is actually better. To name just one thing, the "ein" sequence looks pretty wacky to me. 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ernestine_4571.gif]

--

3) Interestingly, the pattern that optical spacing applied to the serif faces above changes dramatically for sans faces. Below is Parisine at 10pt. Note how in the "bild" sequence, the straight/straight in the i_l combination is tightened a lot more than the straight/rounds surrounding it, making the "bild" sequence not read like "bi ld" as above, but closer to "b il d".
With this one, I must admit the optical version doesn't look quite as atrocious, so maybe optical spacing does work better for sansserifs?
It does startle me though that this was tightened up a lot even at 10pt, which I'm not sure is such a good idea.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parisine_5574.gif]

4) This is just for giggles and to see how far the thing could go. It obviously "could not read that".

Kent, 
<em>"No. This is a case in point for leaving it alone and not using optical metrics."</em>
I probably expressed myself poorly there. What I meant was, could that mean that positive tracking was used in that sample on top of optical spacing*? (I'm not <em>proposing</em> doing that. :-) )

* I meant "spacing" of course, not "scaling".

(Although maybe they didn't even manually track that out, but let their H&Js take care of that …)</div>

I can understand why Carter found Frutiger's shapes so fascinating. I was stuck a few years ago in a waiting in Charles de Gaul airport. It was bare, but the room had these six foot high numbers in Frutiger, labelling areas. In that size you could see every nuance, and admiring and studying the curves was like watching a movie for me, for over an hour while we waited. 

In Rocky the spikes are blunted, so it becomes a different animal. 

I wonder whether the original spacing of Meridian by Frutiger is also bad, because he was following too much his own theories, which in this case were not so good. --He argues on the Linotype site that the space between n's should be the same as the width of the counter. Tracy says it should be less. It may also be just that these long spikes don't allow good spacing. 

I don't know exactly what is going wrong, and it is an intriguing question precisely because it is so well drawn.    

Edit: [[http://www.linotype.com/793-12659/walterkchstypedesignclasses.html|here is the link]] to Frutiger's comment on spacing. 

Kent, I'm wondering what you think of his comment on spacing. </div>

That said, I would agree the optical spacing helps in some places ("inb" tends to look better); but overall, I'm not happy.* I think it's doing too much of the "bi ld" thing (if it tightens the b_i and l_d like that, I'd want less air in the i_l too), and the d_u looks too tight to me too, relatively speaking. But maybe that's just my untrained eye (which is also still very tired of seeing this font).

There you go. I doubt that there has been any wholesale tracking applied on top of the optical scaling. It's possible that the H&Js are liberal with letterspacing allowance. I'm not convinced that's true. But I'm not looking closely at the original.

I think you're correct in observing that the algorithm works better with sans serif designs. I have not explored it much in that realm. I imagine that the wide range and variety of serif structures can easily throw off the algorithm. For that reason, sans serif is probably more amenable to an algorithmic optical spacing routine. I'm not convinced the InDesign version is better than JFP's fitting, but it's certainly not as dramatically worse.

Regarding the adjustments to your type design: The thing is, while it might improve some things, it also worsens others at the same time. This is the crux of my argument -- it's unreliable, at best. Good to be somewhat disenchanted.

That doesn't mean it can't sometimes be helpful in a pinch. But evaluate the results closely; you can't always trust it.


@Bill: Do you mean this comment?:

<cite> "One ground for disagreement was the concept of rhythm in a type line. I tried to show, with the aid of an enlargement of Nicolas Jensen’s roman, that the interior spaces (counters) of the lower-case letters had the identical width of the spaces between the letters, which was easy to demonstrate in a Latin text with its many straight strokes. [. . .] Later on, I designed all my serif faces in accordance with this concept in order to avoid unevenness in the flow of reading."</cite>

This seems overly simplistic and I hesitate to take it at face value. Dwiggins used to make some cockamamie statements, too, about even "picket fence" spacing. Best not to take them too literally.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I don't have enough evidence before me to offer an opinion about the fitting of Meridien in relation to that comment and whether it detracts from Meridien's suitability for text setting. I think I've established pretty convincingly that the sample before us is not the natural fitting for Meridien, which can't be blamed on the font. 

After that, it's pretty hard to accurately assess other variables.

There have been allegations that Meridien is fitted too loose. I haven't seen a trustworthy sample from which to draw any conclusion. 

The letterforms seem moderately wide. And wider letterforms generally beg for slightly more open fitting. When does it all become a problem . . . ?

The tester sample looks like reasonable fitting to me, but obviously that's no way to measure. I'd have to experience the type first hand.

The only other example I have at my disposal is a mediocre reproduction of something from the late 80s, presumably from phototype, and it's definitely set too tight (as was somewhat the habit then). Again, I don't trust that this can be attributed to the font itself.

Xtian made a plea above for examples of Meridien used well. I'll second that motion.

The best I could find was this sample from "Schriften erkennen" (Sauthoff, Wendt, & Willberg; 1998), which I think looks decent – at least a lot better than the book I posted about. Goes to prove how much comes down to spacing: 
(Sorry, more German.)

BTW, I just re-read the Meridien passages in Bringhurst. While, as is often quoted, he does recommend pairing Meridien with Frutiger,* he also seems pretty convinced that Meridien is not in fact a very good face for text.

While on p. 237, he quotes its (then) lacking glyph coverage only in this regard ("in the absence of small caps and text figures, the related Apollo is often more useful for text"), the part on Apollo then gets more illuminating (p. 215, cf. p. 238):
"[In making Apollo] Frutiger used the opportunity to rethink his first text face, Méridien, drawn eight years earlier. Apollo lacks the sharpness of Méridien, but its smaller eye, blunter serifs and reduced modulation can make it a better choice for text […]".

--

* For the record and since we were talking about this before: "Frutiger also mated well with the same designer's Méridien and Apollo, though such a mixture was not apparently part of the original design plan, and the fonts did not match in weight or body size." (p. 257)

Hrant, that is cool. Has your friend set anything with Meridien in the past that we may look at?</div>

I'm still not a fan of Meridien, but in your sample it does seem to read much more fluidly, so I'm pretty impressed with how much really comes down to good spacing (and/or how badly the Adobe "optical spacing" can mess up a well spaced font).

There are still some combinations in the metrical setting that seem strangely spaced to me (like the "c" followed by a straight ascender as in the "h" or "k"), but that might just be me.

One thing I'm wondering about Adobe's optical spacing, based on seeing this, is if it might use excessive care not to let anything touch (or if that really comes down to the book I have being tracked out on top of optically spaced). In examples like the following (sorry about the small size and bad quality), the spacing seems to place more importance on equal distance between serifs than on the actual optical space between letters.

For example, in "Knoblauchkette" it looks as if the "K/n" serifs were made to be at approximately the same distance as the serifs in the "n", which obviously makes the space in between the letters too big. Similar stuff is going on in the samples below.

Have a look at this thread about <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/43911">ch & ck in German</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2439882179/">this related discussion at Flickr</a>. After all, Meridien is a child of the 1950s. I’ve seen faces from that period with much tighter ch and ck pairs.
BTW, Meridien does with almost no kerning. The Roman has a mere 94 kerning pairs, all of them for combinations involving uppercase and/or punctuation. I’d think this is quite little, and typical for fonts stemming from the pre-digital era. 

@William: I wonder if Opera’s horizontals are more robust? Who has a sample?
From <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/meridien/">Myfonts</a>:
<cite>Monotype Apollo can be seen as the Monotype version of this design; Sofratype’s Opera is a newstext version.</cite>

@Hrant: Okay, here’s a setting, flush-left/ragged right: <a href="http://florian.hardwig.com/public/typophile/meridien-left.pdf">meridien-left.pdf</a> [0.8mb]. With InDesign’s hyphenation slider set all the way to the left, i.e. ‘better spacing’ over ‘fewer hyphens’. Additionally, a version with some quick line-break corrections. I hope that is what you were looking for.

But thanks a lot - it's the only way I for one can see anything.

I think:
The Lino Regular is a bit light for its spacing and proportions.
The Lino Medium is well balanced, but shouldn't be used above 10 point.
The BT Medium is essentially a display font (due to its dark tightness).
None of them are paticularly well-spaced (maybe due to light kerning).

Oh, wow. Thanks for an entirely new perspective. I agree with Ralf's statement that to younger practitioners this just looks weird (which is what happened to me here), though I disagree with his stance on blackletter, and consequently feel a bit bad about this as I'm actually quite familiar with the blackletter ligatures but failed to make the connection. What do you think, will this language-specific exception be lost over time?

Also, thanks for the new PDF. I think the font looks a lot better RR than in the justified setting.
That said: 
<em>"Meridien does with almost no kerning"</em>
<em>"None of them are particularly well-spaced"</em>
I'm sort of relieved to hear you guys say that; I was cautiously wondering. Frutiger does have a semi-god kind of status around here (especially at my type design school, where he studied), which tends to make me wary about thinking anything non-optimal about anything he did – which must be BS, as he's human after all.

I'm glad I'm not alone in this!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Florian's link to the digraph thread brought back some vivid memories for me, of my time studying calligraphy and design with Friedrich Neugebauer in 1976-77. Although I was happy to follow along with all of his close-spacing suggestions when we were doing blackletter, we kept having tussles about ch and ck when I was lettering in roman and italic. He was thoroughly accustomed to the use of the digraphs because he had encountered them all his life in his daily reading and therefore felt it was right and proper to write those characters closely; whenever he asked me to follow suit with this, I would argue that when I went back home and was lettering for non-German readers, I would need to put more space between them! 

Unless I am mistaken, isn't it true that in German language, if you see a "c" it is <em>always</em> followed by an "h" or "k"?

		<div class="commentbody">Also, concerning the "picket fence" spacing that Kent mentioned, to my eye that has never seemed like an ideal worth striving for in anything but blackletter. In fact if followed too literally it becomes e x t r e m e l y  b o r i n g  a n d  r e p e t i t i v e ! ! ! (Perhaps it could be the basis of a new font called "Sominex" . . .)

Here's an interesting metaphor that I got from Neugebauer (and he told me he learned it from Larisch): 

As you write your letters, think of pouring water between them. As the water accumulates on the baseline and then rises to the top of the string of characters (either x-height or cap height), approximately the same amount of water should be consumed between all the letter pairs. While one should never follow this slavishly or literally, I think it is a more useful and more concrete way to think about letter spacing than "area". 

You guys may disagree with this approach in thinking about typographic spacing, but over the years as I have introduced students to the making of letters with pen and ink it's been a real help.

Bruce, basically that’s correct. But German language is full of loan words and names from French, English, Greek, Latin and other languages – and has always been. So, a ‘c’ followed by something else than an ‘h’ or a ‘k’ is actually pretty common.

		<div class="commentbody">Ray Nash, who taught several generations of typographers from his studio at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, also used the water idea to explain letter spacing. It is interesting to note that this notion has been mentioned from several sources both here and the threat altaira referenced. I never got around to mentioning Nash while reading that thread.
