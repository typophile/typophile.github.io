body: "I attempted to write the title of this post about 4 times because I wasn't
  sure how to ask it but I think I got it . . .\r\n\r\nAnyhow, here is my question
  . . . Generally I draw in Illustrator and have used ScanFont to import the glyphs
  . . .\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is, when they are brought in via ScanFont,
  I assume they are aligned to points on a 1000 em grid.\r\n\r\nI always make it a
  point to scale the font up so that the cap height is always 700 em, so once the
  glyphs have been imported, when I scale the font properly, will the points (nodes)
  shift to realign themselves with the 1000 em grid?\r\n\r\nIn general I suspect multiple
  scaling efforts will distort the forms if this is the case, otherwise is there a
  predictable way to import the forms so they come in such that the caps are at 700
  em?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any assistance!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart :D"

    fractional values possible.\r\n\r\nYou could scale your art up in Illustrator
    first, so your caps are 700 points tall. Then you can copy and paste into FL with
    a minimum of distortion."

    vertical line as high as your Em (which you then delete in the font editor). That
    way things snap in place automatically and easily.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It has been my experience that this is very little agreement among various
    programs as to where points actually fall.\r\n\r\nI generally import my outlines
    into Fontographer first, then do clean-up and basic metrics set ups. For very
    complex outlines, I generate a Postscript font, then run it through DTL Contourmaster,
    which has the most sophisticated and comprehensive clean-up options of ANY program
    I have yet encountered. I do my final build -- fine-tuning metrics, kerning and
    generating fonts in FontLab. Yes, its complicated and involved, but it works for
    me. Except...\r\n\r\nNONE of the programs ALWAYS agree where points should fall.
    With a delicate curve, a point shift of one em unit can affect the overall look
    (and, if you ask FontLab to fix a problem, it inevidently chooses the WRONG point
    to shift to).\r\n\r\nBottom line, unless you want to build your characters ENTIRELY
    in FontLab, you're going to have to do some fiddling with them."

  body: "When copying and pasting from Illustrator to FontLab, the following things
    are true (making sure \"Do not rescale EPS files on import and export\" is checked
    in FontLab Preferences and \"AICB\" is checked in Illustrator Preferences under
    \"File Handling & Clipboard\"):\r\n\r\n1 point in Illustrator = 1 em unit in FontLab.\r\n\r\nThe
    zero point in Illustrator corresponds to the zero point in FontLab.\r\n\r\nArmed
    with these two facts,\r\n\r\nIf you scale your glyph art in Illustrator so that
    1 point corresponds to 1 em unit, it will be exactly the right size when you paste
    into FontLab. \r\n\r\nIf you set the zero point in Illustrator to line up with
    the baseline and the left sidebearing of your glyph artwork, it will be pasted
    in exactly the correct spot in FontLab. The right sidebearing must still be set
    manually.\r\n\r\nIt's not quite as slick as the old auto-scale trick in Fontographer,
    but it is consistent and reliable. \r\n\r\n(Disclaimer: I have been doing all
    my drawing in FontLab since switching from Fontographer a couple years ago.)"

    It saves me so much of this trouble to simply draw my outlines in the type design
    software. It will simplify things and save time. Draw at exactly the unit value
    you want, and scaling issues will be eliminated except where generating multiple
    formats. I see no benefit in having to make the translation. Alignment, universal
    and local guides, related font family members, all are available in FL. Maybe
    I''m missing something, but since I''m used to drawing in FL, I find Illustrator''s
    tools awkward to use for drawing type. '
