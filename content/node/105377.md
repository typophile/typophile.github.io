  I had more info - but I inherited this font for a logo that I can't change....and
  have so far had to work with just images of it. Anyone who can help identify it
  will be My Hero!"

  body: Hmm. I had hoped they simply did some layering of the text in Photoshop or
    something. Given the client and the budget they had at the time, I'm not sure
    they would have put that amount of effort into it. Argh! (of course, it would
    explain why my search has been unsuccesful thus far!)  Thanks, oldnick! Any other
    suggestions would be welcome!

  body: Those are awesome, Jared - especially the Slappy. So close it gives me hope
    that the exact match is out there! Will still keep looking - but if my search
    isn't more fruitful, at least now I have a back-up.  Thank you sooo much!
