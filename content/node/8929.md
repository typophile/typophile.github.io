  body: The logo is nice. Not sure about the colors.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think you
    need the face on the card. &#40;mug-shots on b-cards are meant only for real estate
    agents. I think that&#39;s a law of some sort.&#41;

  body: I like the design a lot. The light blue looks like a potential pitfall, but
    it&#39;s definitely doing what you want it to. <BR> <BR>On the the orange side,
    the word balloon seems to be going the wrong way. Shouldn&#39;t it be around what
    Heike says? <BR> <BR>As for the logo, I like it, but the the word balloon looks
    just a bit off from the side of the square, perhaps make it parallel or more angled,
    so it looks less like a mistake. The balloon&#39;s stroke is automatically applied
    by Illustrator/freehand, right? The point at the end looks off to me, as though
    the stroke is too thick and deep where the two sides meet &#40;probably from the
    overlap. I&#39;d recommend drawing it as an actual shape, rather than a stroke,
    so you can control the finer details. <BR> <BR>As for the face thing, I like it,
    but it probably won&#39;t work that well for most people &#40;not all of us look
    like Heike&#41;. But if ooni&#39;s willing to take decent photos, I think it&#39;s
    fun and personable. <BR> <BR>And, just for fun, here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/002193.html#002193">not
    so good word balloon logo</a> &#40;scroll down&#41;, in my opinion.

  body: Thanks guys for the comments. The mark could use a little more refinement.
    It has bothered me also, so thats why I put it up here to get some feedback. <BR>
    <BR>As for the colors, I was trying to be the complete opposite of competitors.
    They are dull and uninspired. This is the language school for the MtV generation.
    Trying to modify the methods of language acquistion, so that this is as appealing
    as after-school sports and other activities. Not that any of them are this bright&#40;see
    Mtv reference&#41;and it maybe a tad too extreme, but it is supposed to feel energetic
    and fresh. <BR> <BR>Do you mean the blue is a pitfall, when working with white
    type? Please expand. <BR> <BR>The pictures put faces in an organization. Potential
    customers aren&#39;t numbers, they&#39;re people and we want you to know we are
    &#34;physically&#34; there. <BR> <BR>After going through the rounds of German
    teachers to learn the language, the vision I have is less of a teacher and more
    of a friend. <BR> <BR>Insert other optimistic rhetoric here. Still in the post
    graduation phase.

  body: Although she seems a bit too stringy, I think you should definitely keep the
    chic &#40;and have a second card with a hunk&#41;. This is because one large attraction
    of learning a foreign language is in fact meeting new [kinds of] people. <BR>

  body: '&#34;<i>Do you mean the blue is a pitfall, when working with white type?
    Please expand. </i>&#34; <BR> <BR>Yes. The blue looks sharp on screen, but I&#39;m
    worried that whatever pantone it is will not give you what you expect on a card
    stock. However, I&#39;ve learned the hard way that many inks go darker rather
    than light in printing, so... take it as you will. Also, a photocopier/fax would
    not be able to transmit this business card &#40;if it&#39;s attached to a document,
    etc.&#41;. <BR> <BR>Having seen Vicente Arregui&#39;s post of ICU, perhaps that&#39;s
    an even better reason to veer from the blue. It&#39;s such a good idea &#40;the
    general look/concept&#41; that it&#39;s not a surprise multiple designers have
    hit on it.'

  body: Josh, I keep thinking of the President Kennedy misquote in German during his
    term. He ment to say we are all Berliners. I forgot what he actually said but
    wouldn&#39;t that be a cool image and quote for learning the language properly.

    alt="maciek"> <BR> <BR>Elementally as discussed before, the triangular shaped
    element is carried through here, but upon another glance is it needed?  <BR> <BR>This
    is also a different tagline pitch with the thinks, bleeds, etc. line. <BR> <BR>Hrant-I
    was trying to have a balanced approach in terms of gender. These would be the
    instructors or people like them. Yes they are quite handsome and cute, but who
    knows if they would be this cute. <BR> <BR>Scott- I think you may be right about
    breaking into space. It seems a bit too tight as a composition and breaking some
    lines would not stray far from the feeling and mission. <BR> <BR>My teachers were
    never this way either. Though the thought is to have younger staff that have other
    interests and can incorporate that into the class. They also don&#39;t have a
    huge age gap either. Allows me to slightly justify the chosen colors. <BR> <BR>If
    you didn&#39;t really notice it, the german phrase is answered on the back of
    the card. Thus a person can look back and begin to understand the language  immediately.

  body: I noticed that little detail too, and that&#39;s one of my favorite parts
    of your idea. I saw the card, now I sprechen Deutsch! I like how you&#39;re approaching
    the concept, and the colors do what you said they were supposed to do. I concur
    with Chris&#39; suggestion about the logo balloon outline, and I was also slightly
    confused by the question not being in the speech bubble. Why are the two strokes
    in the logo different weights? Maybe to reduce crowding? Other than that, I don&#39;t
    have any really useful commentary.

    it&#39;s not <i>necessary</i>, but I think it should be there, for identity carry-through.
    Though, I didn&#39;t even see it the first few glances &#40;I though it was a
    piece of paper in the photo&#41;. I&#39;d move it closer to their head, or make
    it point towards their mouth.'
