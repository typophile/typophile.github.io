  a symbol, or design so we could make shirts, we first started drawing up random
  designs with no requirements, other than to look cool. Then we moved to symbols
  that reflect our name (The Rage Driven Pacifists). Then just went to random images.
  But came up with nothing real epic and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas.
  Maybe something grungy?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"

    really works in American, of course... The English counterpart would require a

    random image, ya we're very unorganized.\r\n\r\nThanks again"
