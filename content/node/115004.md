  body: "I'm surprised someone with an interest in avant guard fonts has not tackled
    this. About all I can contribute is to suggest that this type of font might fall
    into a category called wireframe or into neon. I did some digging using these
    terms but did not find a match.\r\nPerhaps this is lettering. It might help if
    you gave some information as to the source of your image, webpage, logo, sign,
    old book etc and the approximate date.\r\nDon"

    roughly 2 years ago"

  body: "OK, this is what the site tells me. Based in Australia, like you, \"Howler
    is a multifunctional, multifaceted arts hub and bar - a concept space hidden within
    a Brunswick warehouse that encapsulates all that is good about design, music,
    theatre, cinema, art and a unique night out.\" Seems quite likely that they did
    this design themselves. It's not a web font in use at the site. If you need further
    info about the design it seems best at this point to follow their contact tab
    and ask them. If it is a font they may be prepared to license it.\r\nGood luck.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Good list by Ryuk, of paperclip and similar fonts, but none really match
    the boxy design of these letters.\r\nIf you can't get a license, you can make
    something similar by doing a continuous line of thin width, with narrow radius
    corners, jumping at right angles from side to side of the strokes in a boxy sans
    serif of median weight per the model shown in the letters on the website. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HowlerBarTypophile115004_6269.jpg]\r\nAs
    for the H in the logo, if it's a trademark, there could be legal problems if you
    made an exact replica. But the concept shown in the letters can probably be used
    in a font design inspired by the posted letters. Some of the corners have to be
    squared to differentiate letters that would otherwise look the same, e.g. O and
    D. Note the different placement of gaps in the line used to differentiate A and
    R.\r\nPossible base fonts include Bank Gothic Condensed http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/bank-sans-caps-ef/
    For the A flip the U and add a crossbar. Straighten the leg on R. Have no idea
    as to the best way to differentiate U and V -- no angles in the design, perhaps
    add a tail to U.\r\nDon\r\n"
