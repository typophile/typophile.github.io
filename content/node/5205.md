  ol pictures and a model builder is building a Down Scale version of the boat - i
  need help to identify the font use for the boat name on the sides. <BR> <BR>So if
  anyone could help me out it would be great. <BR> <BR>/ Jan <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/38281.jpg"

  body: That  ain&#39;t no font  - it&#39;s hand painted. You could try <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/bold/testdrive.html?s=PETERSEN&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Interstate</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/bold/testdrive.html?s=PETERSEN&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">Din</a> to get a similar look.  <BR>But you won&#39;t match this
    with a single font, the Rs don&#39;t match.
