  a great addition and/or a designer should not be without. Benton sans, super grotesk
  and Meta/scala have caught my attention, are these a must have?\r\n\r\n<strong>I
  have inherited:</strong>\r\n<cite>Caslon\r\nGaramond\r\nBodoni\r\nClarendon\r\nLucida\r\nMinion\r\nSabon\r\nTimes\r\nTrajan\r\nWalbaum\r\nMyriad\r\nVag\r\nFranklin\r\nGill\r\nRockwell\r\n\r\n<strong>My
  Additions to the library:</strong>\r\n<cite>Gotham\r\nDIN\r\nNeo sans\r\nUnivers\r\nNetto\r\nBarmeno\r\nCaecilia\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help, Alex"

  body: "<cite>\"You add what you need, when you need it.\"</cite>\r\nSeconded. I'm
    finding this a very nice way to build a library. What good is it going to do to
    buy something now that you'll only want to use later &ndash; and then maybe you
    realize it's not quite right for the project, or something new has been released
    that you like even more?"

  body: 'To answer one of your direct questions: Yes, Benton Sans is a very good typeface
    to have, so is Scala/Scala Sans. I have used those a lot when in need of something
    efficient and authoritative, yet rather neutral. Meta, I''ve never ever used for
    anything. But <em>lots</em> of others have.'

    now. I thought the days were over that typophiles licensed fonts simply for fun
    or for the passion of collecting (probably with the hope and intent to use them
    eventually). But hey, whatever the reasons, licensing new fonts is always great.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRob"

  body: "Needs a bit of Dutch . . . Dolly, Arnhem, etc. Look into a super-family,
    like Scala/Scala Sans or Freight by Joshua Darden. \r\n\r\nI'd try to avoid Times
    and Minion. Substitute Times with StormType Lido (which is free and very well
    done), and although Minion has its place, it's rather sterile. Why not have a
    faithfully revived classic like Bembo Book in your collection? Or something a
    bit more modern and versatile like Expo Serif and Expo Sans by TypeCulture? Mark
    Jamra will even send you a letterpress specimen or two in the mail (they're gorgeous.)
    \r\n\r\nThe possibilities are legion. "
