body: "I'm working on a project for a client starting from scratch on his whole LOOK
  and feel. We've revamped the logo to be more elegant. I've changed the colors for
  a more elegant feel. i've spent over 70 hours on the press kit, the collateral,
  credit card designs, 3-d materials and so on... finding the perfect fonts. etc.
  its pretty far along. \r\n\r\nI get an email this morning from the web developer
  who is working on the website, wondering if we should use the same fonts (his fonts)
  for cohesiveness throughout all the projects. I'm kind of perturbed. As the brand
  manager of this client i just feel a bit miffed right now that everything should
  change to a font that i don't want to use. but i'm not sure i'm correct.\r\n\r\nMy
  arguement is print is not web. the avenues are different. He is using Gotham. for
  i guess the headers and some copy areas. The website is a retail site. it will forever
  be changing. My recomendation is to keep all things cohesive thru photography/color/style
  I've got Rotis family as my font in the collateral. And as the new tag line. and
  i was going to have it on the identity package.\r\n\r\nDo i treat the identity package
  the exact same as the collateral? and then the exact same as the website? this person
  seems to think i should.\r\n\r\nShould we be swapping things out to make it all
  the same? Brand identity stems from the logo and then the fonts chosen for the elements
  that go into the identity. but does that always include the collateral? should it
  include the website?\r\n\r\ni know the problem lies in that we didn't coordinate
  at the outset. but honestly i hadn't a clue there was another person working on
  the project. I usually would be the one to design the LOOK of the website and then
  pass that along. and issues of consistency were never at issue.\r\n\r\nI need some
  guidance here. what do you all do? or how i might address this? I don't have a problem
  revamping the letterhead and business cards to match, but i do have a problem with
  making the collateral (all 30+ pieces) change. The look is established. The client
  loves it. Now with this email it could all change? I need help is my arguement as
  to what i should do. or why it doesn't have to change. (or if you think it should).\r\n\r\nthanks
  so much,\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    materials in general need to be using the same exact style guide? Probably not.
    I agree, web isn't print and often the online branding and offline branding can
    diverge and still clearly communicate the overall corporate brand just fine.\r\n"

    may need their own criteria, but certainly informed by the overall identity."

  body: "Setting aside my deep dislike for Rotis...\r\n\r\nHave you brought this up
    at all with the client? There is a strong argument for using a serif font for
    any body copy in the collateral. While Gotham and Rotis are not exactly a match
    made in heaven, you could put selected elements if the identity package and perhaps
    the collateral into Gotham to tie it in with the look of the web site. Perhaps
    the web developer could bring Rotis into his design a little too.\r\n\r\nMore
    people will probably see the site than the collateral, so I think you don't want
    your materials to look too different, as said by both commenters above. \r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me the client should have managed this better. It's pretty crazy, if
    you're the brand manager, that the web developer got as far along as he did without
    consulting you on his font choices. "

    not sure i\u2019m correct...\"\r\n\r\nI think you certainly are. The whole point
    of a brand look and feel is to ensure that there is consistency across different
    delivery channels. The brand typeface is probably the most important component
    of a brand identity program. Gotham and Rotis are so different that it would certainly
    result in a disconnect between the website and everything else. \r\n\r\nIt is
    standard practice in large identity program to have an alternate web-core font
    for on-screen applications: from corporate corespondence and powerpoints to very
    often, html text in websites. In other words for applications that may be viewed
    in computers that may not have the primary brand typeface installed. Here however,
    that obviously does not apply. If Gotham is being used, it can't be a html site.
    \r\n\r\n'I need some guidance here. what do you all do? or how i might address
    this?''\r\nWell, it would help a lot if you have created some kind of brand documentation.
    Typically when brands are designed, some form of guidelines are created, the idea
    of which is to ensure that everyone else who handles different components of the
    brand, adhere to the outlines of the program. This would normally have a section
    on typefaces that articulates what typeface to use, how and some form rationale
    for the choices. It would also have a set of DO NOT examples. If you don't have
    one yet, you could quickly put one together and use that as a basis for arguing
    your case. There are a lot of useful resources on guidelines [[http://www.identityworks.com/tools/guidelines_and_standards_manuals.htm|here]].

  body: "It's possible to create brands that are typeface-independent, and in fact
    some font businesses do that, e.g. FontShop.\r\n\r\nWhen I worked for Raymond
    Lee and the National Ballet was our client, Ray would use just about any classic-style
    serif type--but he had a way of keeping the look consistent. That's easier to
    do in a small shop with one creative director with a lot of style, harder when
    relying on a manual."

  body: "Hi all... thanks so much for the input. i haven't gotten that far to create
    the documentation for outside vendor uses.. we are still in the designing phases.
    \r\n\r\nI have calmed down :) and i called my account service guy and gave him
    my input. and also sent him a page of heavy copy with the rotis as is. and with
    the gotham (which they are just soo different)... I'm not sure i should get into
    it directly with the developer company.\r\n\r\nI work with a small firm who the
    client employs. i don't work directly with the client.  but i did confirm that
    theclient LOVES our new direction. and yes its approved. So i mentioned this little
    request will cost alot to redo. And that brand identity should drive the other
    arms of our projects. not the other way around. \r\n\r\npatty why don't you like
    rotis? i'm using sans.. i like it but i wouldn't call my self an expert on typography.
    i just pick what i like based on feeling. the gotham font seems too playful and
    way too round... part of the problem with the revamp was that the old colors and
    logo were too playful, hence low-end. and the new goal is to make it more elegant
    and upscale. "
