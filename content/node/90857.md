body: "So I need a display font that can be used in a logo and probably in the staple
  brand typography. I'd love to get something bespoke done, but there is no time and
  very little money, if it can, it needs to communicate:\r\n\r\n-Internationalism,
  as in have broad international appeal\r\n-quality (of course!)\r\n-ambition\r\n-academic
  excellence\r\n-prestige\r\n-heritage\r\n\r\n-as an alternative to internationalism,
  London.\r\n\r\n\r\nReally, I am looking for people to pot-shot fonts that are distinctive,
  ownable (ie not a Helvetica or Dax type font that is used by loads of companies),
  something that can be used in typographical treatments that will have enough character
  to be recognisable and 'ours'.\r\n\r\nI realise this might sound a bit like doing
  the whole freakin job for me, but really, any thoughts or ideas would be greatly
  appreciated, I'm really intrigued to see what people think.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nOwen\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    sounds like you already have a text\r\nfont lined up? Knowing what it is would

  body: "Well, it's Trade Gothic at the moment, I was going to stick with that in
    as much as I see it as a fairly dependable sans with good x height etc so good
    for setting in large bodies of type, quite neutral, lots of weights. If you'd
    like to suggest another Combo or body font that fits better with my spec, then
    by all means do so!\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nOwen\r\n"

  body: Thanks, I had a look at your type, they look great, just not right for this
    project. I'll bear you in mind in the future though.
