  &#34;<a href="http://www.sessions.edu" target="_blank">www.sessions.edu</a>&#34;.
  As you know my origin is bulgarian and thus I am unable to afford a substantial
  tuition in the field of graphic design. Currently I am designing and accumulating
  money in order to invest in my future education.  <BR>This thread is simply for
  some feedback about the &#34;Graphic Design Master&#39;s Certificate&#34; found
  at &#34;<a href="http://www.sessions.edu/program/graphic_design/masters.html" target="_blank">http://www.sessions.edu/program/graphic_design/masters.html</a>&#34;.  <BR>My
  main concern is : &#34;Does it worth it?&#34;;&#34;Would the certificate be valued
  by employers?  <BR>In general, please comment on this specific master&#39;s program
  for graphic design.  <BR> <BR>All your words will be highly appreciated.  <BR> <BR>Sincerely,  <BR>Galin

  body: $5000 seems substantial to me. Aren&#39;t there graphic design programs in
    Bulgaria?  <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t comment on this particular program, but as someone
    who has taught, I think face-to-face interaction is crucial.

  body: Galin, <BR>Everything that Dana said is absolutely true.  No one ever asked
    to see any of my diplomas.  The questions then becomes, what will the school teach
    me that will help me create a good portfolio to get a job; what will the school
    teach me to help me actually do my job &#40;and therefore keep my job&#41;; and
    what will it teach me so that I can further teach myself throughout my life to
    grow.  Think of school as a swimmers racing dive.  Any dive &#40;or school&#41;
    will get you wet; a better dive &#40;school&#41; will move you further along and
    allow you to keep pace with the competition; the better racing dive and design
    school will launch you into the lead.  This supposes you have the talent, drive,
    and willingness to work hard enough to take advantage of what the school has to
    offer.  A school will maximize who you are from what you bring to it. If you are
    water, it can make you clear and refreshing.  If you are wine, it can make you
    robust and appealing.  However, no school can change water into wine. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: 'I think comparing demand to see a diploma versus a portfolio is misleading,
    because a client would only ask to see the former if he suspects you of lying&#42;,
    while he <i>needs</i> to see the &#34;innards&#34; of the latter to figure out
    what you can do, and if your specific skills and talents are compatible with what
    he needs. So a better question would be: What proportion of clients ask you about
    your formal education &#40;or check it out on your resume&#41;? <BR> <BR>&#42;
    And is furthermore willing to reveal that. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Galin, <BR> <BR>I believe that you&#39;re asking if it&#39;s worth your money
    for an online course or if you should keep saving. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know about
    this particular online school, but my caution is how much more are you going to
    get from an online course that you can&#39;t get from a book? Other than critiques,
    what more are they offering you? I&#39;d write them a letter and ask just how
    much more you&#39;ll benefit. Also, ask for their credentials. <BR> <BR>You might
    also try finding a number for a professor at any design school, explain your position,
    and ask him/her what they think. My experience is that people are very helpful.
    And often, they might suggest another alternative of which you are not yet aware.
    <BR> <BR>Good luck.

  body: Post graduate work is becoming more important in the U. S. and is considered
    mandatory if you want to teach, but beyond that portfolio is still the thing that
    gets you work. As for online educaiton, I may be prejudiced, but I think in person
    works much better. It&#39;s vastly easier and more productive to work in person
    with a teacher and with others. Seeing what others are doing in response to similar
    design problems and getting feedback from different people is very important.
    I&#39;d say, keep saving your money for a real school. <BR>George
