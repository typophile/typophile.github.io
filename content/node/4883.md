    try <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/handel-gothic/bold/testdrive.html?s=ASPIRIN&amp;p=72"

  body: James Gareth, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the suggestions... those two fonts are pretty
    similar, but not quite what I&#39;m looking for.  Agency is really cool though,
    I might use that for some project. <BR> <BR>Thanks!
