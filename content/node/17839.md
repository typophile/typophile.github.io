  a UK government department:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.defra.gov.uk/\r\n\r\nIt occured to
  me that it could be a custom logotype, but I'm sure it's close to something. Frutiger's
  is quite similar (eg. the text below it is Frutiger), and so is Syntax, and it also
  reminds me of some of the 70s ITC fonts. I think the stems on the d and a look painterly
  compared to the rest of the face; it also looks like the a has been adapted from
  the d for display use.\r\n\r\nI'm designing the masthead for a newsletter (for Defra),
  and I'd like to try something similar to their the logo but with uppercase rather
  than lowercase letterforms."

  body: 'Thanks. I never would have guessed it, an Apple novelty font! Already had
    it on my machine, even. The logotype does swap the a and the d, but not in the
    way I had expected: the d is adapted from the a. The crossbar on the e is widened
    as well.'
