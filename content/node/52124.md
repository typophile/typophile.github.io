    ruined some of the curves from the original font. But other than that it seems
    simple and straight-forward enough. What kind of clothing?\r\n\r\nBut it is nice
    that you've connected the S and the n."

  body: Omg thats weird, it looks like the same font I used except it had a different
    name. I have posted a new pic of the "g" also so its not mistaken for a "q". Its
    male clothing. Thanks heaps for your help.

    have any ideas what font would look good with the "Snag"?

    so doing, get more space between letters, \r\nclose up the top 'bowl' of the \"a\"
    so it is similar-to but not identical-to the \"g\",\r\nor, if this does not make
    immediate sense, do as Michael said. \r\n\r\nCheers!"
