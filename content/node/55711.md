    this, I wonder. Poor people (like me) shouldn''t be allowed to use it :)?'

  body: The last part of my comment was a joke, Paul. Honestly, 18 well-crafted font
    files for $340 is not bad at all, but I simply cannot spend that much money at
    once. Offering smaller packages (or even better, single weights) gives people
    like me a chance to use the typeface. I don't see how that would interfere with
    their eating patterns ;)

  body: What about asking Underware directly about licensing a single weight of Sauna.
    They are veeery nice, and friendly, and helpful, and if there is anybody out there,
    who would be able to help you with this, it sure would be them.
