body: Hello all.  Could someone help ID the script font on this weddding invitation?  The
  font used where it says "Emily & Aaron"?  I'm trying to recreate a similiar design
  for the place cards at my wedding to match our invitations.  Thanks!

  body: What I find sad about it, is that in most instances people aren't even exploring
    the typeface. Sad really. It might be the most over-used under-utilized script
    font.

  body: "Tiffany, in some ways that's not all bad. The hugely flamboyant initials
    can really be overkill, and it also takes restraint not to get carried away with
    all the optional beginnings, endings and other flares that are part of that set.\r\n\r\nOne
    reason for the limited use we see is that I think a lot of people don't really
    know how to use all the OpenType character sets. Some OpenType fonts and applications
    are more user friendly than others. I don't know how many times I've answered
    questions about 'how do I get the Bickham Swash font'?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: True on the OT. But the number of people who don't understand gets smaller
    every day. It's something like the move from CRTs to LCDs, casettes to CDs, DOS
    to GUI.

    only saying that there have been missed opportunities for a little apropos flourish
    here and there.

    OS X(10.1) Once that happens, who knows?\r\n\r\nTiffany, I understand, and I agree
    with you that Bickham has a lot to offer. I was burned-out by a customer who wanted
    swash everything, so I know there can be too much of a good thing.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    like Bickham's alternate characters & ligs - used a bunch of them in a recent
