  \ the attached photo is of a font that seems really similar to futura but isn't
  quite there.  I like this one more, any leads?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nNic"

  body: "What is metal Futura?  \r\n\r\nIt seems like it is uh, 'stouter' :  The cap
    height is a lot shorter and it seems heavier.  Both of which I guess are pretty
    academic and don't necessarily mean a different font.  I'd just like to be able
    to find this exact font somewhere."

  body: "Before digital there was lead type. That's what Lex means by metal. Unfortunately,
    it's near impossible to find \"exact\" digital matches of metal type. A lot of
    it has to do with the fact that you're looking at a metal type impression and
    offset printing works so differently.\r\n\r\nOne thing you could do for stouter
    caps is use <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/urw/futura_caps_medium_ot_std/&sample_text=sonic%20sound&sample_size=36\">Futura
    small caps</a> with the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/paratype/futura_medium_ot/&sample_text=special%20microphone&sample_size=36'>lower
    case</a>. But that's probably <em>too</em> stout."

  body: "Awesome! Thank you for the links.  The Futura Caps Medium is actually almost
    perfect for the all capitalized words and the Twentieth Century 2 semi bold gets
    very, very close to my sample.\r\n\r\nthanks for the help!\r\nNic"
