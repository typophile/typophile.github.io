		<div class="commentbody">Being an investment company, and needing a font that matches it, how about  we all pool our money together and hire a good designer, who will then not be paid and the CEO gets paid a bonus to randomly pick a knock-off font which we can pay again to have someone fix.

		<div class="commentbody">An investment company willing to go with a cheap or free knock-off as opposed to investing in their own identity? That doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Be very, very careful there TweakingKnobs - that doesn't sound like a good client.

But as to your question: maybe try <b>[[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium|Gentium]]</b> - it's a relatively nice, "classical" looking serif. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">TK, you might want to start by asking yourself "is anything that's free have any quality?" The same question could be asked about your services to them as a client. (Edit: Yes, there are many free typefaces out there that have lots of quality!)

If they're serious about investing (and business in general), then they'll surely understand that investing in a quality typeface will get them much further than a free one.

As far as suggestions go: It would be hard for anyone to know what typeface is suitable for their company, without having a deep understand for their business goals and their customers goals.

Get to know them, and get to know type. I recommend reading Ellen Lupton's Thinking with Type: http://www.papress.com/thinkingwithtype/ You can probably grab a copy from your local library (which would be free). It's an easy read, with plenty of food for thought.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanx for the replies , but you didnt actually answer my question just bemerx25  did and i totally dont like that font.

the company is acctualy my mother and his friend,is not a big enterprise with lots of money , the designer is me , yes i will not charge her , most of the people dont see the difference between helvetica and arial as an example that a good free font will do the job.


So please just guide me in what kind of font is good for this purpose , a thin one a bold one, a serif a sans i dont know about typefaces and how to use them , i like futura extra bold,helvetica,avantgarde and frakfurter for example , but i dont know what kind should i use for this purpose.

Please guide me to what kind of font i should choose, comertial or free.

thanx</div>

		<div class="commentbody">TK,

Perhaps you should see what other investment groups use for their identity. Think about what kind of message their type choices communicate and use this research as a baseline for exploring what typeface would work best for your mother's company. 

I don't really have any suggestions because right now the design problem is fairly vague - an investment company that doesn't appear to have a niche (what are they focused on investing in? who are they trying to serve?), I don't know what kind of audience they're looking for (who's going to use them? and why?), and I certainly don't know the people behind this company. 

Defining or answering these questions may help you have a better idea of what kind of typeface you're looking for - and then I might be able to help you more.</div>

I agree with bemerx25, answering those questions will help you form a more informed opinion. As well reading up on the history of typography. A brief background would do you a lot of good at this point.

That's what the investment bankers on Wall Street are saying too :)

Seriously though TK, the question is crazy. You cannot pick a typeface with no understanding of what it is for except "investing". Even if by chance, we happened to give you the perfect typeface, without any knowledge of typography you will probably put it to poor use.

		<div class="commentbody">TK, the advice to do some homework so that you are equipped to make these types of decisions on your own is sound. It's what will make you a serviceable designer, leave alone great for the time being. 

Having said that, here is a little (general) advice based on experience: 
Investment firms and law firms are two of the most conservative categories of client you will come across. They often look to convey trustworthiness and a penchant for winning with their communications. Friendliness and client focus are secondary elements to these types of brands. Contrast that with a personal banking service, who prefer to appear helpful and approachable. Investment and law firms are hired to be bulldogs. Typically, you want austere, conservative and traditional imagery that doesn't shout. 

But only your mother and her partner can say if the above is appropriate to their business.

As for free fonts, have a look at Fontin Sans by Jos Buivenga. </div>
