  is known for his personal annual reports, as well as his contribution to Penguin's

  target=\"_blank\">Daytum</a>.\r\n\r\nDaytum is essentially a data diary system.
  It allows you to log and track your personal day-to-day activity and then visualize
  the collected information in a variety of ways. The site is clean and attractive
  and looks like a lot of fun:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://daytum.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img
