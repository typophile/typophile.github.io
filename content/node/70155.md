body: "Several people have contacted me recently in regards to the following topic,
  so I figured I might as well make a formal announcement\u2026\r\n\r\nAfter more
  than 3 full years of commitment, I've recently brought my position as the first
  full-time designer for MyFonts to a close. I'm very glad to say that I'm still on
  the best of terms with the MyFonts team and have nothing but the best wishes for
  them in the future. Working with John, Kevin, Chris L, Chris D,  Jan, Laurence,
  Adam, and Joshua was one of the best experiences of my life, and it's hard to imagine
  finding a group of people as intelligent, supportive, or pleasant to work with as
  them.\r\n\r\nWith all the time and energy I've put in to overhauling its design,
  MyFonts has come to feel a bit like my \"baby\" over the years. Plus, not much made
  me happier than helping type designers \u2013 many of whom have become my good friends
  \u2013 to make a living from their work. Suffice to say that moving on was a hard
  decision to make. There are still many things I would have liked to have done before
  taking my leave, but I'm very proud of the work I accomplished with the MyFonts
  team and trust they will keep things going in the right direction.\r\n\r\nWhile
  I'm sad to be leaving such a great job with MyFonts, I am just as excited about
  a new position I've taken with Font Bureau. Many of the people involved with Font
  Bureau are people that I have looked up to throughout my life \u2013 people who
  inspired me to get involved in typography in the first place. Even before working
  to promote their fonts via MyFonts, Font Bureau has been one of my favorite type
  organizations, so naturally I'm honored to be involved. Especially after attending
  the annual Font Bureau offsite meeting on Martha's Vineyard this past weekend, I'm
  looking forward to working with such a skilled and knowledgeable group of experts."

    won me over! Thanks for doing a great job on that and good luck at Fontbureau.

    is a huge boon for FB, Nick. I was absolutely thrilled when I first learned, and
    I'm even more excited now that you\u2019re officially in place."
