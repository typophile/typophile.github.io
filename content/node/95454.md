body: In the hope of arresting the attention of designers whose eyes glaze over at
  the appearance of the 'Quick brown fox' and other whacky pangrams, I've taken to
  telling a short story in my type samples, and I offer the idea to you (so you know
  you heard it here first!)  See attached png for 'Contessa', and look out for more
  in the pipeline from my foundry (Studio-K at myfonts.com).  Your comments are invited.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Contess

  body: Great idea but, "(so you know you heard it here first!)" isn't really true.  Many

    a pangram, lacking the <strong>l</strong>, <strong>q</strong>, and <strong>r</strong>). '
