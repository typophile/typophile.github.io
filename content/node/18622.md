  body: "This looks like it might be a modification of Arial.\r\n\r\nThe 'O's, 'U'
    and 'S' are all capitals. The 'r' is probably the 'U' cut in half and flipped
    vertically. The 'p' could easily be an 'O' with an added stem.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Whoops - did I say Arial? I guess the terminals of the 'S' aren't as angled
    as I thought. The shape of the letters are right for both Arial or Helvetica,
    as long as the tips of the 'S' are cut off.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: pretty close to futura also....I guess it maybe too close to several others
    to actually be a family on it's own

  body: It looks quite<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/light/testdrive.html">
    Akzidenzy</a> to me. Certainly not Futura -- its structure is grotesque, not geometric.

  body: "I considered Akzidenz when I was trying to figure it out, but the regular
    weight doesn't have the correct angles (as far as I can tell). It could be the
    light weight with a stroke added (and all of the other modifications I suggested
    earlier).\r\n\r\n - Lex"
