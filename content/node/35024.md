  fonts Adobe is shipping with CS3 (Creative Suite 3) are updated/altered versions
  of their fonts? The files' modification dates show March 2007, where my older Adobe
  files show 2003. I don't want to replace my existing files, but at the same time,
  don't want to have issues with older fonts.\r\n\r\nI notice that some faces are
  \"new\" additions, while some have been dropped; Adobe Garamond Pro, for example,
  is included on the disk, but only in four weights (regular/italic/bold/bolditalic),
  while their earlier release (which I think came with CS2) includes the semibold/semibolditalic
  weights. Nueva Std, on the other hand, includes four new weights: boldcondensed,
  boldcondensedoblique, condensed, and condensedoblique. And they've thrown in venerable
  fonts like Prestige Elite -- I'm hoping the metrics haven't gone all wonky and will
  screw up older docs (though I'll leave the PostScript version on my system just
  in case).\r\n\r\n"

    far as I know, the fonts are the same version as the ones that shipped with CS2
    (e.g. AGaramondPro-Regular.otf is version 1.007 in both CS2 and CS3).\r\n\r\n>
    <em>(though I\u2019ll leave the PostScript version on my system just in case)</em>\r\n\r\nKeep
    in mind that the (PostScript) Type 1 versions of some fonts are NOT necessarily
    <strong>fully compatible</strong> with their corresponding OpenType (CFF) versions."

    store a copy of the font along with the project's files. (I believe this is a
    common practice among editors/publishers, not necessarily because of eventual
    metric changes between font versions)"

    compatibility problems at the expense of probably violating the \"Number of Copies\"
    portion of the Font license. I suppose you could buy a license for more copies,
    but then you'd have to update it from time to time as the fonts were used for
    more & more projects."

    and the InDesign (or other application) files. Most also \"require\" the fonts

    I'm here to tell you, it is also common."

  body: I think everything has been covered. Storing the fonts with a given project
    would probably be seen a gray area anyway. But never make assumptions when it
    comes to the law. It is better to err on the safe side. Especially if your archives
    might be accessed by other people whom do not have authorization or license to
    use the fonts.

    it's so easy to use \"password recovery\" tools.\r\n\r\nLet me take this opportunity
    to point out that for OFL'ed fonts, none of this would be a problem. I know the
    range and quality of designs aren't there yet, but for specific clients (maybe
    nonprofits who need to repurpose the work for lots of different media, but don't
    have a budget to buy fonts themselves), it might on occasion make sense to limit
    oneself to fonts available under those licensing terms, in exchange for the added
    flexibility and, dare I say, freedom."

    by the way, the PDF a publisher sends to NetLibrary has to have the fonts fully

    EULA, but an indication of what real world practices actually are.  "

    right. If the \"Number of Copies\" becomes an issue, one can always do the other
    way around: store text files next to the fonts' backup, detailing where and when
    they were used. This practice also has the benefit of helping the font licensor
    calculate how much return s/he got from them."
