  body: "Photolettering era horizontal stretch of any of several fonts. Looks like
    the base font was also thickened for the wordmark.\r\nSome imagination needed
    to envisage the original.\r\nHelvetica? Folio?\r\nDon"

    recreate it with a digital font, Newhouse Extra Black (with some horizontal stretching
    and vertical compressing) might do the trick:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/newhouse-dt/\r\n\r\nBureau
    Grot from Font Bureau (with the same alterations) would work nicely as well:\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BureauGrot/"

  body: "If STEREO was a font it is unusual in that the horizontal width of the counters
    of _R_ and _O_ and the corresponding interior portions of _S_ resemble a modern
    font like Newhouse DT Extra Black [img:sites/default/files/old-images/NewhouseDTExtraBlackAsStereo_5545.gif]
    but the outside curve is significantly expanded. Do the horizontal expansion of
    the outside curves and compress the height and the result could be in the ballpark.\r\nDon"
