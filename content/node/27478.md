  Time's 'Style' Supplement is currently employing a courier-esque typeface for all
  its headings. I'm currently without scanner or camera but was wondering if anyone
  knew off hand what this typeface may be.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    you mean. We have one here in Seattle, and I think there is a London one, and
    of course the New York Times, and I suppose many others.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: if you say "courier-esque", <a href="http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Categories/Text+Fonts/Courier+Sans/">courier
    sans</a> by lineto comes to my mind. but you'll get better results with a scan
    ;)
