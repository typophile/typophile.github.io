  Typography classes that there are some rules to know about typography that help
  us understand the context for informed typographic exploration. One of the rules
  is to avoid using too many different typefaces at once. When more than one typeface
  is used it is usually to create emphasis or to separate something from another.
  When too many different typefaces are used, the page becomes too chaotic, and the
  reader is unable to see what is most important. \r\n\r\nI think the typography in
  this flier/magazine page uses too many different typefaces that ultimately do not
  complement the theme or go well together. I think it is definitely possible to achieve
  a better look if instead of using seven different fonts, they narrowed down a couple
  better fonts that complement the theme of festival. I like the \"Krewe of Endymion\"
  typeface maybe with the typeface used for \"Come Welcome Endymion's...\"\r\n"
