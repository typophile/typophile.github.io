  'The Very Best of Billy Idol' with cover artwork by Shepard Fairey in his characteristic
  red and vanilla colors.\r\nI was interested in the font making up the word 'IDOL'
  with the slanted tops of the glyphs.\r\n\r\nIs it a real typeface or just modified
  from one of the tall fonts? I haven't been able to find it anywhere.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help.\r\n"
