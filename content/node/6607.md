body: i can&#39;t remember where now, but i saw a font the other day that had the
  same width for several different weights of a font. i&#39;m wondering when is this
  useful? is this adviseable under &#34;normal&#34; conditions?

  body: 'I call that &#34;uniwidth&#34;. One of the MRF fonts &#40;Delicato?&#41;
    does this. Another example is the graded fonts at Font Bureau &#40;although that&#39;s
    meant for compensating for gain, not for marking visible weight differences&#41;.
    And then there&#39;s the Hoefler display font series - Proteus Project. But probably
    the most prominent example is the Compatil system by Linotype - an amazing effort.
    BTW, my own Patria does it too, but only for the Regular and Demi weights, not
    the Light and Bold. <BR> <BR>I think it is -or at least can be- highly useful.
    The only problem is that beyond a certain weight range you have to start sacrificing
    the width/narrowness appearance of the whole to maintain the widths: the lights
    start looking wide and the darks narrow. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: I agree with Hrant that this can be used within a certain degree. In my case
    with Delicato I only used regular, medium and bold. If you&#39;re using typefaces
    like this for huge masses of text, you can easily change weight, without having
    the textflow to change &#40;or rather character of the print, regular could represent
    modern sharp print and bold could be equal to older techniques when lead was used&#41;.

    This makes it possible to switch effortlessly from Roman Wide 1 to Roman Wide

    &#40;Roman Wide, Roman Condensed and Italic&#41; have the same width as the corresponding
    medium variants &#40;Medium Wide, Medium Condensed and Medium Italic&#41; thus

  body: so is this kind of thing fairly common then? is using this kind of uniwidth
    spacing scheme viable from a roman weight to a bold weight? or is the scope more
    limited? i&#39;m sure it depends on the design... i would think this kind of uniwidth
    scheme would work better for a sans than for a serif, or does it matter? What
    elements of design would allow this kind of spacing to work? what design elements
    would keep it from working? is there any literature on such models that i should
    be reading? i&#39;d like to know these things!

    divergent the two designs seem. <BR> <BR>T

  body: originaly i wondered how useful such a scheme would be. it seemed to me that
    this kind of thing would compromise either the design of the bold weight or the
    spacing of the lighter weight. but maybe one could strike a happy balance? I&#39;m
    trying to think what are some instances one would be so concerned about spacing
    as to make this kind of spacing scheme desireable? sure it might be nifty, but
    is it really necessary in any particular instances?

  body: It&#39;s very rarely &#34;necessary.&#34; <BR> <BR>In a normal monospaced
    design, of course, one would expect the bold face to be the same width as the
    regular. <BR> <BR>I seem to recall old typesetting systems that duplexed the italic
    with the upright, so that the italic had to be the same widths. But my admittedly
    foggy recollection of this does not include matching bold to regular weight. <BR>
    <BR>It can doubtless be done well or badly, relatively speaking, but mostly I&#39;d
    wonder why do it at all. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: The example that bugs me the most is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sabon/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=The+quick+brown+fox">Sabon</a>,
    which as I understand was designed around the quirks of both Monotype and Linotype
    systems. All in all, Tschichold did an amazing job with the constraints he was
    working with, but there are definitely widths that seem off to me. I&#39;m sure
    that I&#39;m not the only one that finds the italic &#39;o&#39; to be too wide,
    and others have observed the same of the roman &#39;a&#39;.

  body: Uniwidth for letters is not really useful in the different weights. Note that
    is a FF Balance feature. But for figures and monetaries quite important for tabular
    setting. <BR> <BR>What bug you in Sabon is corrected in Sabon Next. <BR><a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/SabonNextLT"

  body: I was just going to weigh in and mention tabular figures. FF Unit  <BR>has
    tabular figures which makes lining up charts, invoices, or  <BR>anything with
    columns of numbers nice looking. But, I can&#39;t see <BR>strong reasons for a
    bold and regular weight following the same <BR>width. &#40;But there are always
    exceptions.&#41;

  body: '&#62; I&#39;d wonder why do it at all. <BR> <BR>Well, for one thing, if you
    derive multiple weights from a single source weight, you can just leave the widths
    alone &#40;as long as you derive accordingly&#41;. So in a way not changing the
    weights is easier! Coupled with the fact that uniwidth <i>can</i> be useful sometimes
    &#40;like if you prefer to mark emphasis through weight change instead of italics&#42;,
    and would like to maintain linebreaks&#42;&#42;&#41; it makes sense - as long
    as you realize that there&#39;s a threshold beyond which the compromise to the
    integrity of the design &#40;in terms of its characteristic width/narrowness&#41;
    is too much. That&#39;s why Trinite &#40;and Patria&#41; only apply it to the
    Regular and Medium/Demi weights. <BR> <BR>&#42; Like in TYPO magazine. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;
    Another place uniwidth is relevant is animation. <BR> <BR>BTW, Raph, there was
    once an interesting Typophile discussion about Sabon&#39;s constraints. <BR> <BR>hhp'
