    InDesign sorely needs to take a few lessons from Quark. Quark has a kerning pairs
    feature which InDesign lacks. This lets you override a font's default kerning,
    pair by pair, and preserve these settings for future use. Believe me there are
    a lot of badly hinted fonts out there. I've complained about this in the past,
    both here and on Adobe forums - and received support from other frustrated users
    but not a lot of response from Adobe.\r\n\r\nMS Word is not designed to be a typesetting
    software. It's for word processing, and as such is not likely to be able to produce
    the same level of finesse. For typesetting you need really to use Quark or InDesign."

    though the example the top right of the piece was curious. To my eye, the unkerned
    VAST was superior to the kerned version -- the kerned one suggested two abbreviations,
    \"VA\" and \"ST\" (for Virginia Streets?)\r\n\r\nEvenness applies to the whole
    word, the whole line, the whole page. To get the right spacing between \"V\" and
    \"A\", you have to look at VARIATION, or some such word. All the spaces should
    be even. Tough, isn't it.\r\n\r\nAnd with cap-lowercase kerning, for goodness
    sake don't get the first lowercase letter closer to the cap than to the following
    lowercase letter(s).\r\n\r\nTo answer your question, round pairs sometimes require
    a \"positive\" kern (+). If you set the sidebearings of your round letters so
    they need little or no kerning with many other lowercase letters, they are usually
    a bit too tight against themselves. You are free to pick a particular strategy,
    but usually the result is the need to kern a few pairs -- which ones depends on
    the particular strategy you picked when setting sidebearings.\r\n\r\nThose of
    us dinosaurs who grew up reading material set in hot metal -- especially set Linotype
    -- perhaps have a different perspective. You couldn't kern Linotype. But you could
    have badly set Linotype and well set Linotype. There are other spatial relationships,
    you know. Maybe that notion can help with kerning -- it is just one more spacial
    arrangement, and has to fit with all the others (wordspacing linespacing, margins,
    etc.).\r\n"

    One is the two side bearings of each letter, which specify the gap between the
    left and right most black of the letter and the adjacent letters. That is called
    \"spacing.\" The other set is numbers which specify how to change that default
    spacing for specific pairs of letters, like AV, Ta, etc. This second set is called
    \"kerning\" metrics. So when you adjust specific pairs in a layout program you
    are also \"kerning.\" \r\n\r\n>if there available any exact method to kerning

    this is--it is a craft to be learned, which is the point of the exercises, which
    are very good. \r\n\r\nThere is the automatic \"optical spacing\" of Adobe, but
    the eye can be better. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I think people might object to in

  body: "I don't have a good formula and doubt if one  is even worthy of pursuit.
    The fixed spacing is typically anything next to a straight vertical like a cap
    H next to any letter. Kerning pairs are for situations when a fixed spacing is
    impossible. This is typical of diagonal letters like A and V or letters with large
    gaps like L and T. The idea is to try to minimize the holes caused by adjoining
    glyphs with airy underarms. The problematic thing is balancing the kerning adjustment
    throughout a font. The V to W with the A to V with the W to A and so on. The perceived
    color should feel comfortable next to fixed letters like H next to N. This is
    no mean feat. There are problems with overlaps and tensions between near overlaps
    struggling to keep a parity with extended appendages. If you think Latin caps
    are tough to space and kern, try Cyrillic! There are way more problem children
    there to contend with.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "<cite>I\u2019d be interested in Charles\u2019s views on this.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    don't really have a fixed view. In our work, we have to accommodate the \"House
    Style\" of the publishers we work for. Usually \"House Style\" is a combined effort
    of editorial and design, with the editor's opinions frequently ranking higher
    than designers. Some editors devoutly believe (i.e., a matter of faith, not to
    be swayed by any argument) that letters should never \"touch.\" Occasionally,
    I have even had ligatures marked \"PE, touching.\" This one I fight for (\"If
    you want us to set your books, you'll have to allow ligatures,\" which isn't an
    argument but an ultimatum).\r\n\r\nMore subtle would be a case like Galliard,
    where the \"quotedblleft\" frequently touches a capital letter. Gives it a bit
    of a hint of a swash cap, which I think just fine with Galliard's letterforms
    & spacing. But more editors will mark that an error than will let it pass, so
    our kerning in Galliard removes that bit of touching -- & I take the more common
    approach that the space between a double quote and a letter should be a bit more
    than the space between the two marks making up the double quote.\r\n\r\nIt is
    fairly common for display type to be considered an exception; though for some
    editors, that too seems to fall under the \"no touching\" rule. In these cases,
    if the designer's layouts have made clear that touching letters in display are
    what the designer wants, we'll do it & let the designer fight with the editor.\r\n\r\nFor
    text, my personal feeling is that the type design itself tells you when touching
    or even overlapping letters are OK; the nominal spacing in the font gives you
    the clues. For me, Galliard works, & some things touch. An overly aggressive tracking
    of a looser font often just ruins the font.  "
