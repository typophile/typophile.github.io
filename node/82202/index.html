Fonts being vector based, even zooming in won't impair any quality, so I'm not really sure if hinting will be necessary when all computers and portable devices are built with high res screens.

Also, if hinting isn't necessary, will the font file be significantly lighter, allowing webfonts to include more otf features like ligatures?

Thanks for your inputs on this :)</div>

Heck, it's already unnecessary for iOS because Apple's Quartz rendering engine ignores built-in hinting anyway. And yet this has approximately zero impact on font production, because what matters isn't the least problematic environments, it's the most problematic environments. So the question isn't just when we will start having noticeable numbers of super-high-res devices, it's when will we no longer have to worry about the other devices... and that will be many years later.</div>

Since there is no time when this will be true, 200 to 300 dpi screens literally everywhere,  I'm going to start assuming people who talk so knowingly about the relationship between hinting  and resolution are just showing off.:)

This is the third time I found this said by the same person!?

Quartz does not ignore built-in hinting. This has been discussed and examples shown.

		<div class="commentbody">DB: You're being more rude than seems called for under the circumstances.

However, in the interests of accuracy, I will henceforth change my usual comment to one with the appropriately nuanced caveat, such as this: "With normal settings and sizes, iOS Quartz rendering completely ignores all hints in a font."

The full explanation? At normally used sizes, with standard settings, Quartz ignores hinting. At *very* small sizes, it turns off anti-aliasing entirely and displays hinted, aliased glyphs. A user can change the default for the largest "very small size" if they like, to make it a bigger size so it will actually matter in practice. The possible range of settings is 4 to 12 pixels. The default is reportedly 8 px, which has no impact at what I think of as actually usable font sizes on screen. Even Verdana is not hinted to be usable at 8 px, as counters close up and the like. But I suppose that for the right typeface and if you were into extreme hinting, you might try to make something more workable at 8 px (or below).

However, a user could increase that setting as high as 12 pixels, which would come into play quite a lot.

So, yes there are some circumstances, with people who have changed their system settings, in which hinting matters in Quartz rendering. Or if you want to go beyond where mainstream fonts have tread to date. I have long regarded this as an extreme corner case, and used the more simplistic phrase about what Quartz does. 

Note: I haven't spotted a way to change this setting on the iPhone. Given the pixel sizes and resolutions involved, I'd say this really is irrelevant to the iPhone.

Well said.

David, maybe Thomas is making a useful simplification? My own view doesn't go much further than his; I certainly believe that Apple's rendering is carelessly blurry. But I myself would appreciate learning of any attenuating complexities.

“So, if a normal human eye can discriminate two points separated by 1 arcminute/cycle at a distance of a foot, we should be able to discriminate two points 89 micrometers apart which would work out to about 287 pixels per inch. Since the iPhone 4G display is comfortably higher than that measure at 326 pixels per inch, I’d find Apple’s claims stand up to what the human eye can perceive.”

Long short, there’s only so much detail the human eye is physiologically capable of detecting. Sure, if we get in an look at the type 1 cm away we'll see a difference, but at 12 inches, ~300 DIP is our threshold. Beyond this neither resolution nor hinting make a significant difference.</div>

Never mind high-res screens, I have always preferred letterpress to offset.
As the man said, we have two eyes.

I also prefer rotogravure to halftones, and spot colour (including metallics and fluorescents) to CMYK.

The nature of LED screens is quite different to print: it's transitory, emitted light—whereas with print the image is fused into the medium, and illuminated by reflected light — you can turn the image and it changes, and even without moving it, one is aware of the different effect of reflected light through two eyes. The printed image is an object, an artefact which may be possessed in a relationship that is more substantial and profound than that involving temporary images on a screen.

Monitors are quite different to laptops and tablets. With monitors, the image plane stays relatively the same angle to the viewer, but with tablets, you can manually twist them away, more like holding a print document.

My sincerest apologies. 

When, and upon whom is such simplification useful? It took 3 years, from 88-91 to re-educate the public after Adobe "usefully simplified" PS to treating fonts and graphics exactly the same. We're still re-educating over the "hint for CT just like for aliased fonts", MS "simplification". 

Here is a user who wants to know, in pretty clear denial of the economics and processing requirements of resolution, whether we can have more OT features if we don't have to hint fonts. 

If the truth is anywhere, it is that all OS operating below 100 dpi, use some hints sometimes, and...that resolution is to OT features as bluejays are to oak trees.

		<div class="commentbody">Despite the fact that the human eye can indeed distinguish letterpress from 300 dpi laser printing, one has to admit that hinting would usually not be relevant there, except when one gets into the realm of microprinting.

Also, while it is quite correct that abandoning the users of older or less-expensive devices is unconscionable, there <em>is</em> also the consideration that hinting is extremely problematic at the moment. The technology is essentially limited to proprietary environments because Apple still holds patents covering the use of hinting with TrueType. Of course, there's also the Adobe Type 1 font standard, and I remember hearing of a little-known third alternative outline font format which includes hinting (I can't find the name, but it may be one of Fastfont (Atech), Intellifont (Agfa Compugraphic), Nimbus-Q (URW), or Speedo (Bitstream); it definitely <em>wasn't</em> Metafont I was thinking of), but those are proprietary as well. (TrueDoc, derived from Speedo, does include hinting, so it might have been the one I was thinking of.)

Thus, hinting is essentially unavailable with free distributions of Linux, which means that it would be highly desirable to be able to avoid it completely.</div>

That is a good point. Obviously, hinting is <em>necessary</em> if one is going to be using vector fonts, as opposed to bitmap fonts, on a display screen with conventional resolution.

I'm not trying to say that people should give up displaying text on computer screens, I was merely pointing out that there is an issue surrounding hinting that does give a reason to try to do without it.

That’s not true. Look into the source code of FreeType, even they agree that all the patents have expired by now.

And besides, hinting is essentially unavailable on Mac OS X too, so should we also avoid it for that reason?</div>

Ziefle, M. (1998). Effects of display resolution on visual performance. <em>Human Factors, 40(4)</em>, 554-568.

<strong>Abstract</strong>: The role of display resolution in visual information processing was investigated in 2 experiments. Experiment 1 examined the effects of 2 CRT conditions (resolutions of 60 and 120 dots per inch [dpi]) and a paper control condition (255 dpi) on proofreading speed and accuracy. The results showed that reading performance was significantly better in the paper condition than in the 2 CRT conditions. Experiment 2 examined the effects of 3 different CRT resolutions (62, 69, and 89 dpi) on eye movement parameters (fixation duration and number of fixations) in a visual search task. Further, search reaction times (RTs) and observers' ratings of visual fatigue were analyzed. RTs and fixation durations were significantly increased in the low-resolution condition (62 dpi) as compared with the high-resolution condition (89 dpi). The significant interaction between display resolution and time both for search RTs and fixation durations was taken as evidence for stronger fatigue in the low-resolution conditions. Additionally, the extent of visual fatigue correlates both with search RTs and eye movement parameters. This finding gives rise to the assumption that observers' responsiveness to effects of display resolution in terms of visual fatigue differs markedly Actual or potential applications of this research include recommendations for the use of high-resolution displays (90 dpi and greater) to optimize visual performance, to make prolonged on-screen viewing more comfortable, and to avoid visual fatigue.

Note the year. Old news. No electronic text is available from the databases and I do not have access to the paper version yet. However, it appears as though reading comprehension is not being measured. Knowing where and when people look, and how tired they “feel” doesn’t really tell us anything about comprehension. It’s entirely possible (and very easy to do) that an exact replication of this study could yield no significant difference in comprehension, were it to be measured. Give me another hour and I could probably find a study that supports (or refutes) this. Dyson or Larson have probably already done it. Again, I would need to read the entire paper to support or refute its conclusions.</div>

The default, I thought was 10 or 11. But the points are three. If you say "Apple OS uses no hints", you are mightily insulting MS, who in the same reolution spectrum, uses lots of hints. In fact they need everyone to hint or else. 

Second, the clear facts show that the OS does use hints, so why repeatedly say otherwise? 

>Or are you aware of some other use of hints by Apple?

Yes. The Mac OS has the capability to special case any font, gaspishly using hints to any OS specified size, or ignoring the user's smoothing prefs, and presenting smoothed fonts below the users prefs. This, doing what the font says, special casing applies to Courier and Luci da Grande at least. 

And third, I'm still here. I can't leave or else, well, just imagine I wasn't here for the last 6-7 years of lies rendered and rerendered. ;)

so as a windows user, do you just set your smoothing to none? Does that work for ya?

>Special-casing: how do we get MacOS to do this for our fonts?

if you want your font to antialias only, you name it LucidaGrande, and for non- antialiasing, I'd try naming it Courier.

>I don’t think there is any hinting in Apple mobile devices (with iOS)

Me too. So as I have my smoothing set to 4, the type from my desktop, to my iPad, to my iPhone, all have the same general presence on the page, though as the resolution increases it all gets crisper.

I've wondered for some time, how windows devices handle this, with the discontinuities between CT and print (which it's lighter than), and CT and unhinted windows rendering, where the asymmetrical rendering drops off. I just hope there isn't a problem in the pad resolution spectrum, in the middle between, all and no hints being used  in windows rendering.</div>

And to me, rendering "inconsistency" between sizes/devices/whatever is cosmetic. This is sort of parallel to my rejection of the Modernist "gray rectangle" approach to typography - it's display-centric, not in tune with how people actually read. And I would argue that Apple is [now] a display-centric company.

		<div class="commentbody">Concerning the less relevant issue of what kind of system I personally work on: I've used computers since 1977, age 9. Contrary to what somebody who doesn't own a cellphone might seem to be, I'm no technophobe. I've called myself a "technoskeptic" :-) since I do feel I know when a technology is unnecessary to me personally, and I don't like just buying stuff, so I'm not into getting the latest-and-greatest; it just has to do what I need, and I'm not editing video! The time I spend staring at a glyph makes hardware performance moot. BTW, I'm on my fourth car, and none of them were bought new. I will move to Win7 one day (I avoided Vista - we probably all agree it sucked too hard) but just last month I bought a new 9-cell battery for my warhorse (after 5 years), for $35. Which is a nice segue to Apple, since gradually they're making their batteries non--user-changeable, and this belies a business philosophy I'm not alone in hating...

Apple isn't "wrong" to sell stuff (except to the extent that Capitalism is wrong, and you can't blame individuals too much for the system they've grown up in) but I do feel that does not equate to the qualities that I personally value, not least functionality, yes, at the expense of popularity, superficial attractiveness, etc.

All that said, nobody should ignore the reality that Apple <em>does</em> have a lot of presence these days, especially in the portable market; so testing on those platforms is critical. Which is why I'm grateful to LAUSD for putting a free Macbook about 3 feet away from me.  :-)

That's great, and I once had the same Spartan views, but if you're going to talk a lot about the way your or other people's fonts behave, appear and perform, specifically, or in gross generalities, shouldn't you have and use these devices to the point of being immersed in the user-experience, to see your and other people's work and support the validity of your points?

Back on the thread, I seldom but deeply wonder about how much other stuff, besides dpi, would have to change to bring some vast majority of the lap 'n desktop crowd up to 300... like graphics processing power, battery life and OS software. Anyone else?

And then, there's the graphics state of the web in this pined for resolution rapture.:)

For reading size, to me it is. Whenever I look at OSX rendering, all I can
think of is wasted potential. And, really, is it so shocking to suggest that
Apple's solution is a vapid cop-out, that they no longer really care about
type, that they don't mind if people read less? When is the last time you
saw a Lofting at a conference? What about Chalkboard? Come on.

In contrast MS's work of the past many years -in type and elsewhere-
borders on philanthropy - I tend to see it as a quest for true functional
improvement. That's pretty shocking for a huge corporation. It's also
why Apple makes more money now. And this is coming from somebody
whose disdain for MS in the 90s is well documented, on this very forum.

Hopefully once Apple becomes preposterously rich like Microsoft some
sense of social duty will sprout, and then we will see amazing things.

I don't view type aliased up to 30ppem; what I said is that seems
like a good maximum in terms of user choice. I've disabled* CT but
otherwise have not changed anything. So -for most fonts- anything
higher than 16ppem gets anti-aliased, but -critically- it's still hinted.

* Actually it might be that I never enabled it;
I forget what the default setting was back then.

Agreed. And I do have a Macbook handy, and I've always been a
big believer in testing. But I don't have an iDevice, so I admit to
not being immersed in that realm. However I'm not making type
for hand-held devices* so it's not such a big deal. Any convincing
I might be qualified to do remains in the realm of larger screens.

* I'd love to, but it's hard to crack.

What I would <em>love</em> to do is a subpixel-manual-anti-aliased font. But that requires support for color bitmap fonts. Oh, and an amount of time I haven't had in a while...  :-/

My take on the original post in this thread was that person was wanting to know (if not indeed HOPING to know) that they need not bother learning the tedious TT hinting process because 300ppi was knocking at the door  ;-).</div>

Right, I wasn't abundantly enough clear. Everybody who knows what they're making screen text fonts for, likes hand-tuned, full x-hinted greyscale fonts the bestest. 

You, as I intended to say, are against the current regimes of anti-aliasing, where the horse and barn, the ship and dock, and train and station are parted, aliased windows users missed them all and are out of the mainstream appearance of TV, Pad, phone and all new Windows platforms.



Blessed wife indeed. How about now? OS anti-aliasing of digital outline fonts on demand has a future, no?</div>
