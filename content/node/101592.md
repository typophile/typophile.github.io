  largest type family just got bigger! Originally designed by Veronika Burian and
  Jos\xE9 Scaglione as a titling typeface, [[http://www.type-together.com/Tablet%20Gothic|Tablet
  Gothic]] is quickly becoming a news designer's favourite. The font delivers the
  sturdy, straightforward and clean appearance expected from a grotesque combined
  with a good measure of personality. Now with the obliques making it a total of 84
  fonts with six grades of condensation, [[http://www.type-together.com/Tablet%20Gothic|Tablet
  Gothic]] can deliver consistent impact even better, whatever the publication format.
  \r\n\r\n<strong>Please [[http://www.typetogether-news.com/lists/lt.php?id=LBgDUA8IUQpSSAcGXBgCAgQC|contact
  us]] if you wish to upgrade your copy of Tablet Gothic to include obliques.</strong>\r\n\r\nmore
