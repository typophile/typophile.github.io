body: "I'd like to get a temperature readout from fellow designers about using work
  from a previous employer to hock your own future endeavors.\r\n\r\nSame old story,
  worked for a company, did a lot of great work, but since I'm no longer with the
  company, I can't really show it. I left to do my own thing, to fix the problems
  I continually saw that no one would let me really address correctly, but being able
  to get work relies heavily on your ability to show you can do the work.\r\n\r\nI
  have a couple of clients who are friendly with me, who will utilize me, rather than
  the company where I was formerly employed. They are fine with me using their work
  as examples of my skills, but as they were done while at another company who does
  similar projects, who may have those projects listed in their own portfolio, you
  can see the dilemma. \r\n\r\nThoughts?"

    no reason not to. But using it in an online portfolio would tempt fate, so you
    might have to do what Brodovitch did when he came to the states: make a fake portfolio
    of work for imaginary clients."

  body: "My contract doesn't explicitly state anything, as they never got around to
    having me sign anything. This was a mistake on their part, but one that works
    to my advantage. \r\n\r\nUnless I had express permission from the owner of the
    project, I would never show the work. So anything proprietary or unreleased wouldn't
    be shown.\r\n\r\nI've thought about the imaginary client thing, but as I'm building
    a new website for the company, and find myself with text but few example images
    to show, well, you can see why I came to typophile anyway :p I'm doing as much
    as I can with text and design on the page itself to show my skills, but when I'm
    discussing usability & design concepts, to not be able to show my work is hampering.
    And creating project that showed my skills would be even tougher :p\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your reply :) More food for thought!"

  body: "Since you're showing the work publicly, the proper thing to do would be to
    ask your former employer for permission to show the work. Your employment contract
    with them is only one detail, they also had contracts with the clients, which
    frequently include NDAs and other details.  \r\n\r\nIf you do show the work, be
    very clear about what your role was in the project and give credit to your collaborators.

  body: "You can show your work, as long as you make very clear that it was done while
    working at the company you where working at that moment. If you are clear about
    that, it shouldn't be a problem.\r\nI mean: don't just show the pretty pictures...
    add a line of two of text telling the story about it.\r\n\r\nAs an example: I've
    been running a little website design agency for severals year now, and I don't
    have any problem when designers that no longer works for me, shows the work they
    did when working whit us, in his own portfolios. As long as they states that the
    work was done for my company."
