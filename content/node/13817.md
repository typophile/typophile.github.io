body: Anyone know of a MacOS X application that can browse folders of fonts while
  previewing them? I had something like PhotoMechanic or the Photoshop browser/Bridge
  for fonts in mind. I know there are several applications which can view currently
  installed fonts or added fonts, but that's I want something a little more dynamic.
  (Something unlike FontAgent or Reserve; although I haven't used the most recent
  version of Suitcase.) Sorry if this is something very common, I'll feel dumb and
  go hide in a closet.
