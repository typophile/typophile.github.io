  body: "It's hard to see the details well enough to be sure that this isn't actually
    hand-written. There seems to be variation in the identical letters, which I know
    OTF fonts can handle, but I could not find this in any of the places I would usually
    look for casual scripts (Veer and MyFonts).\r\n\r\nIn the case that this is hand-drawn,
    or custom, some alternatives I found that had similar spontaniety were: Dolce
    thin, Enchanted, Brisa, Galgo Script, Donaldson Hand, Django, Justlefthand and
    Allison. The first three were only at Veer, I think, and the rest were at MyFonts.\r\n\r\n-

    it so much. I appreciate all of the alternatives, they just don't have that same
    sophisticated hand that I saw in the original...\r\n\r\nI appreciate the responses.
    Thanks!"
