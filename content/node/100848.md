  body: Don't know this one and tend to agree with Nick, most probably a freebie or
    at least heavily customized. The only one that came to my mind is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/gas/|Gas]].

  body: 'Thanks defiantone :) Right, Gas is not free but that''s also not the right
    one. Some letters remain totally different though: /S, /E and /&. May be they
    simply recreated these letters from Gas too.'

  body: "interesting. searched identifont to find more info, and they show 2 foundries.
    the one linked above and Fountaintype. visiting their link reveals the following:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snaps_4536.png]\r\n\r\nplus,
    i wouldn't put it past the HRRA to modify it for themselves. looks better."

    happened. At any rate, it'll work fine for my purposes. Thanks everyone! \r\n\r\n\u2014AP\r\n\r\n"

    long as they don't redistribute it.\r\n\r\nBTW some people redraw a font once
    they develop qualms about how they originally made it... In fact I wouldn't be
    surprised if Fountain has asked T26 to stop distributing Gas, but were rejected.
    But it's just a hunch.\r\n\r\nLarry, if you can wait for the more legit version,
    please do.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
