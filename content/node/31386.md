    word instead of the common English one, for instance Welnetz in lieu of Internet,
    why don't you use a German word for radio, too? (Weltnetz H\xF6rfunk???)"

    ones for both. We'll try.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n@ Dan\r\nYou are right. I'll change
    it.\r\nThe anglo-american culture-imperialistic influence of the last 62 years

    is so strong that you forgot that radio was not an <em>urdeutsches</em> word!
    The word \"Internet\" is used so often in German today that I am sure that your
    grandchildren will think it a completely normal German term in 62 years, too ;-)"

    out of a book \"Die Weber\", from Gerhard Hauptmann anywhere in the beginning
    of the 20th century.\r\nAfter starting of Industrialization in Gemany (and other
    countries, like England, too, of course) lots of cloth was produced in small private
    homes. These webers went on strike, because the could not feed their families
    anymore. And they burned their looms (Hurray to Babelfish). \"Maschinenst\xFCrmer\"
    stands for people who are living in the past and who don't see that times are
    changing. I am not a \"Maschinenst\xFCrmer\", but I want to hold and protect my
    language for my german people. (In deep respect to other languages).\r\n\r\n\"Undeutsch\"
    was \"NS-Sprech\" (Terminology of Nationalsozialismus). That's not my way of thinking
    (and you know that of course).\r\n\r\nTo use german words for english ones in
    german language - if there are perfect words for it - is very senseful. I read
    that in Finland 95 percent of IT and computer terms are translated into finish
    - without any problem. The finish international specialists use both - english
    and finish - but for national requests they use finish terms only. Nobody thinks
    (as I know) that Finland is too nationalistic.\r\n\r\nI'ld love to translate my
    complete website into english. But the problem is: My own english is too poor.
    And the translators I know are not familiar with all the terms out of typography
    and letterpress.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

    try keeping just the heavier bar at the top of the link buttons rather than framing
    the whole thing. My German is not good enough to translate but hopefully there
    are enough native German speakers on Typophile who could help with the more technical
    terms.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I just dislike the idea that something like the word \"Internet\" has to
    be translated :(\r\n\r\nIt isn't like, before the introduction of the word \"Internet\"
    into German, there was a German word for the Internet. The Internet is a new concept.
    It was given a proper name (with a capital letter! By English speakers! What a
    concept!). Is it neccessary to translate that when both the sounds \"inter\" and
    \"net\" were already common in German-language anyway? <em>(Z.B. Interaktivit\xE4t
    oder vielleicht auch Networking?)</em>\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, sometime German
    (marketers?) create new \"German\" words that are supposed to sound like English
    ones, but which are completely unintelligible in English. The best (or worst)
    example of this may be \"Handy\", i.e., the German word for a mobile phone. A
    mobile phone may be a very handy thing to have, but no English-speaking country
    called that sort of telephone that name. This causes many young Germans minor
    troubles when they go abroad\u2026 they think that are communicating in a common
    language, when they are not necessarially doing this ;-)"

    I know that times are changing.\r\nAnd I for myself prefer international contacts.\r\nI
    think most of the germans do. An american collegue\r\nfrom Kodak said to me, I'ld
    be the most outgoing geman,\r\nhe ever met. Its 20 years ago but 'til today I
    do not\r\nknow if he wants to joke me or not.\r\n\r\nI'ld love to read books from
    Truman Capote, John Irving,\r\nNormal Mailer in your american language. But my
    knowledges\r\nare too poor. But it was enough for Jack Kerouac, when I\r\nwas
    young. My stays in US, working for Atex, a Kodak company\r\nin Germany, was extremly
    interesting. Not only the job, but\r\nalthough (or more) the personal contacts
    to the people in\r\nNew England and NYC, too (yes). Everyone was very friendly\r\nto
    me (mostly travelling alone for months) when they mentioned,\r\nI am German. No,
    they asked \"Are you from Germany, 'cause they\r\nheard it). And they all or most
    of them where patriotic americans.\r\nThat's alright for me, 'cause I am a patriotic
    German with my\r\nown wonderful language and books from Arno Schmidt, Heinrich
    B\xF6ll,\r\nJoachim Fest and others.\r\n\r\nUsing a foreign language sets borders.\r\nVery
