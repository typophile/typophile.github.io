  body: 'Aside from my usual assortment, I&#39;ve got some new additions in heavy
    rotation: <BR> <BR>The Dears <i>No Cities Left</i> - I really like some tracks,
    I really don&#39;t like others. <BR>Madvillain <i>Madvillainy</i> - Great stuff.
    <BR>Mos Def <i>Black on Both Sides</i> - A classic I was long overdue to get.
    <BR>Arcade Fire <i>Funeral</i> - I got sucked in by the blog hype, but it&#39;s
    really growing on me. <BR>Handsome Boy Modelling School <i>White People</i> -
    I think I prefer their first album, but there are some great tracks here.'

    to mp3 -- and I&#39;m having great fun rediscovering long neglected bits of my
    music collection by putting the full thing on shuffle. Some of the transitions
    are a bit jarring: from Momus to a movement of Penderecki&#39;s 2nd cello concerto
    to the latest Green Day album to the solemn Alma Redemptoris Mater.'
