  body: "Hi-\r\n\r\nI've asked you not to shout.\r\n\r\nNick's request is a reasonable
    one. We're not superhuman, we can only do our best with what you give us.\r\n\r\nAnd
    besides, a scroll through Google images reveals bigger, clearer samples of this
    logo two or three pages down.\r\n\r\nIf you want us to make the effort to help
    you, please make a little effort in return.\r\n\r\n-NJ"

  body: "No buddy i am not shouting. I just replied to oldnick post. Telling you one
    thing if this image was clear then i would choose to trace it manfully instead
    of shouting :P.\r\nI always do search on Google for clear images first. Have u
    ever found that i asked for clear image here it is available on internet.\r\n\r\nAsking
    help here is the my lost choice. I always search font first in my font collection.
    Then i try on dafont also. & then ask on what the font & here.\r\n\r\nJust informing
    you."

  body: "When you use all capitals, it appears as if you're shouting.\r\n\r\nI'm not
    saying you shouldn't come here for help, whether it's your last resort or your
    first. That's what the forum is here for, after all.\r\n\r\nI performed a Google
    search using the terms \"penn state\" and \"white out\", and on the third page,
    found this (http://onwardstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/design41.jpg) image.\r\n\r\nWe're
    happy to help you - we enjoy it, or we wouldn't be here in the first place - but
    if you can help us by posting a clearer image, one which takes no more than a
    minute to find, we can help you more quickly, more smoothly, and more graciously."

  body: "Thanks, that would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\"White Out\" is BudHand.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/budhand.font?nb_ppp=50&text=White+Out\r\n\r\n\"Penn
    State\" is, judging by the registered trademark symbol, a custom job. However,
    GreyWolf has a dingbat of the logo.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontspace.com/greywolf-webworks/big-ten-mania\r\n\r\nThough
    it is not the font used for the Penn State logo, Gerald Gallo's Display Intense
    is similar, and with some modifications could approximate the letterforms in the
    Penn State logo.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gallofonts/display-intense/\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious...what do you plan to do with all these sport-related fonts?\r\n\r\n-NJ\r\n"
