body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am new to this forum and would like to ask your opinion on the
  readability and possible webfont combinations for this logo.\r\n\r\nMy client is
  a yacht charter company, aiming for a contemporary yet timeless and elegant brand
  ID. The name is rather long and unusual, but they insist it has to be one word,
  not \"xxxx Yachts\". There's a story behind that. \r\n\r\nI've selected Brandon
  Grotesque with enough kerning, aiming for a clean effect without feeling \"clinical\".
  \ In a small enough size, the logo gets the effect of Savoy hotels ([[http://bit.ly/1AglwCH]]),
  clean and refined. But, since we'd like to avoid lower case and different font weights,
  first readers may wrongly put emphasis on the \"AYA\", instead of on the \"E\".
  Is that how you perceive it?\r\n\r\nRegarding the website fonts, I was somehow hoping
  to use Univers, which I love particularly on this website: [[http://bit.ly/1pklIZd]].
  However, if proceeding with Brandon Grotesque, I'd possibly use the same font for
  the main menu and headings, and keep the body text neutral with Univers or Arial."

  body: "I don't know what you mean by putting emphasis on the 'AYA' instead of the
    'E'. To me \"merayachts\" looks like one German or maybe Dutch word. I suppose
    if there are photos of yachts below I'll eventually figure it out, but otherwise
    there's no way I'm reading it as \"MERA YACHTS\".\r\n\r\nYou haven't \"gotten
    the effect\" of SAVOY, which is thin as opposed to regular weight, and half the
    number of characters. I think yours might prove to be too long in practical applications.
    In any event, it's rather bland and undistinguished."

  body: '"Mair-ray-yachts" is how I read it. Maybe I would''ve read it as one weird
    big long word if I hadn''t known it was a yacht thing beforehand. I like the look
    of Brandon Grotesque but I think you should maybe try something at least somewhat
    condensed for this? (anything to save space and make it look shorter) I don''t
    think the big kerning is helping the readability either, even though I''m obviously
    a fan of loose kerning. Something about Brandon Grotesque and the way you used
    it does look very ''yacht-y'' / nautical though, so maybe it could work...'

    the captain. But you're right here. Looks like we'll have to consider splitting
    up the word, or something else to make the word digestible. SAVOY is indeed a
    different case...  \r\n\r\n@LooselyKerned: It will be hard to part from the loose
    kerning, but it's clearly not helping here. Have you seen this one [[http://bit.ly/1t7BPQk]]
    of Quintessentially? Ah... Fascinating you are getting a \"yacht-y\" impression.
    I thought that the \"1920's NYC\" urban feel of Brandon Grotesque would work against
    me. \r\n\r\nBack to the drawing board, thanks to both."

    you mean to say that your client is your captain, that may be true, but the final
    captain is the millionaire who's shopping for a yacht. Too often, the client fails
    to realize who you're really designing for."

  body: "Captain Howdy, I'm not quite sure whether wealthy clients really notice about
    a logo being just acceptable or remarkable or brilliant. The more complex the
    product or service, in a market that is already niche, the less brand ID seems
    relevant. But things are slowly changing. Look, in charter companies the most
    memorable logo's are [[ http://bit.ly/1ozgqwz]] and [[http://y.co/]], Y.CO being
    the most consistent and contemporary. The rest is a bit like this [[http://bit.ly/1nOW8hL]],
    corporate rather than desirable. \r\n\r\nIt seems like people think: to catch
    the attention of a billionaire client we have to look corporate and expensive.
    But what does \"expensive\" actually look like? Twitter is worth more the best
    law firms. Besides, isn't a yacht about enjoying good times? Shouldn't it be a
    memorable experience for a client to order a yacht, instead of just meeting corporate
    looking brokers in corporate looking offices with corporate looking logos? "

    thinks more is being said than was actually intended. I wasn''t suggesting that
    you ought to make the mark look "corporate" or "expensive" or anything else. I
    was merely suggesting that you figure out how to make it appealing to your client''s
    particular target market, whoever they are, and try to impress upon your client
    that the goal is to please that market, not himself. For example, your client
    insists on a one-word name despite the fact that it will be illegible to his target
    market. '

  body: "I have to say Merayachts is one of the most confusing brand names I've seen
    in a while. Before reading it's a yachts charter company I had no idea how to
    interpret the logo. The problem I think is that the Y wants to belong to both
    Meray and Yachts and thus I didn't even think to pronounce Mera Yachts instead.
    I second what Captain Howdy said. At times I find it almost miraculous how clients
    tend to think their brand is for themselves rather than for their target market.
    At times I've even used a typeface I didn't like personally but it worked for
    the target market so I put my personal taste aside.\r\n\r\nI think Brandon Grotesque
    has a bit of that quality of late 19th century engraving typefaces. I think something
    a bit more squared and industrial might work well for a nautical company. You
    might want to do something with the M, such as in this unicase branding I see
    every day when I go to school: http://www.erasmusjournalisten.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Koen-Suyk-_ANP.jpg\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, why the hell is Y.CO playing Tech House on their website? I guess that's
    what the target market wants..."
