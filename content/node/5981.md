    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Quite a few inconsitencies, primarily T &#40;awkward
    weight  <BR>distribution&#41; and V &#40;can&#39;t have straight lines in this
    design&#41;. <BR>It&#39;s too freeform IMHO, you should stick closer to the rules  <BR>you
    set out for yourself. This might sound contradictory, but  <BR>you need very rigid
    rules&#42; to pull off this kind of design if  <BR>you don&#39;t want it to end
    up looking amateuristic. More later. <BR> <BR>&#40;&#42;&#41; Check out some Rian
    Hughes designs for comparison.

  body: Hi Jim <BR> <BR>i agree with yves on T and V, i think you should also forget
    the straight lines on your M and W. i think that in your Z you can figure out
    another solution. <BR> <BR>maybe you will have a legibility problem between A
    and R, and X and H, i think you should try a bigger difference between them. <BR>
    <BR>good bye and good luck with UF.

  body: 'Hi Jim, <BR> <BR>This font deserves another weight, because the counterforms
    need to be completed for a block composition, maybe in the lowercase. Interesting
    posibility for a display font. <BR> <BR>Look at Tiki Wood, here: <BR><a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=TIKICD-FO&amp;sub=view"
