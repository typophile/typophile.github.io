  body: What's your definition of "Garamond"? Some Garamond/Granjon punches still
    exist so the most accurate type would be metal type cast from matricies made using
    those punches?

    the most beautiful one (for my personal opinion) was the TypoArt one. And another
    one.. well.. this was the Monotype Garamond (I don't like the Mono):\r\n\r\n\r\nD.Stempel

  body: Your request for the "Real" Garamond threw me, seemed as if you were looking
    for a non-obvious answer. Here's the obvious answer... http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/garamond/garamond.html

  body: I think that ITC Garamond is the most accurate. Especially if you squoosh
    it a little bit. Makes for great fruit logos.
