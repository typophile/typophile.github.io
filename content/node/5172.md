  body: I&#39;d hazard a guess that it&#39;s calligraphic lettering, and not a font.
    <BR> <BR>It does remind me a bit of <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=204998">Treefrog</a>
    though...

  body: 'I thought of treefrog too - checked whatthefont - still nothing. It&#39;s
    gotta be a font. - the full part of this logo has identical letterforms in other
    words. e&#39;s , s&#39;s and a&#39;s all the same.  <BR>it&#39;s driving me nuts
    - that no one knows this one - as I&#39;m to do the french version of the nameplate.
    <BR> <BR>too many display faces out there you know,  you&#39;d need a rather big
    noggin to know them all - but I&#39;m hopeful that the collective brain called
    typophile will help. pretty please with a cherry on top. '

    like that illustrator brush default...but the rest I donno <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/38129.jpg"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>don&#39;t mind the other stuff - I have nothing to
    do with it&#60;/font&#62; <BR> <BR>oh crap - upon closer look I think you might
    be right. the a&#39;s are different. the F&#39;s are slightly different - but
    I&#39;m hoping that that&#39;s just because the designer was a good one and altered
    from a font. please say it&#39;s so.'
