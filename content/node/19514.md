    fast tools like RapidWeaver or you could get the professional app Dreamweaver
    (this ships as a cross-plattform CD). Both tools include FTP functions, but you
    can also take a look at Transmit 3.5. \r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.info"

    quarter 2007. That being said I've heard that they run about as fast as the current
    G5s. There have been a few hiccups with the OS.\r\n\r\nYou can transfer through
    the terminal if you're handy with Unix, but I would recommend Fetch for ftp. It's
    pretty cheap and really easy to use.\r\n\r\nThere's no web page editing software
    that I'm aware of with the operating system. Maybe you need to get the premium
    suite, which comes with GoLive. The next edition of the suite might be pretty
    exciting, the CEO of Apple stated that they are going to more tightly integrate
    their product line. They own Macromedia so we shall see\u2026\r\n\r\nI think it's
    true about the Adobe switch, you just need to transfer your license, but check
    their website to make sure.\r\n\r\nMacosxhints is great if you want to dive into
    Unix. MacFixIt has its merits. The Apple boards are about as good as any\u2026\r\n\r\nThere's
    a million boards out there for Macintosh, you don't really need to subscribe to
    a magazine.\r\n\r\nWalk towards the light, walk towards the light\u2026\r\n\r\nJust
    kidding, CPUs are dispensable every three years. I'm in love with monitors.\r\n\r\npeace\r\n\r\n"

    then the SE30 cames out months later, Wallstreet Powerbook no floppy, no USB then
    Apple discontinues the floppy drive and the only way to transfer was with a PCMCIA

  body: 'One piece of advice: go to the refurb section of the Apple store (it''s at
    the lower right of the Store page - the red SAVE banner). These machines are factory
    refurb, have been given new serial numbers and have all the same guarantees as
    new machines for as much as 1/3 off the price. I bought an iMac there for a song
    and it works great. You should buy an extended Apple Care protection plan as well
    (even for a new machine).'

    Some are merely machines someone bought on a whim, decided they didn''t want it

    it as new anymore so they restock it and sell it as used or refurbed. '

    so far, is if you go into a Mac store, the salesman are much better informed than
    the average PC outlet salesman, who it seems tries to act like he is informed,
    but usually doesn't know what I am talking about when I ask a simple question.\r\n\r\nI

  body: "I'm a longtime Mac user but I haven't taken the plunge switching to the Intel
    Macs yet. The 17\" MacBook Pro does look very nice however. Virtualization technology
    (such as Parallels) that allows you to run Windows apps with decent performance
    also makes the Intel Macs quite attractive.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering having
    a laptop as your only machine, I <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to think
    carefully about backups and the AppleCare extended warranty.\r\n\r\nAlthough the
    machines are pretty expensive, after a while the data on the machine will be more
    valuable than the machine itself. If the laptop is lost or stolen, or if you need
    to send it in for repairs and they wipe the disk, you'll be toast unless you have
    good backups. You can get a coupla hundred G external FireWire disk for $150-$300
    depending on speed and capacity.\r\n\r\nYou should also consider the AppleCare
    extended warranty, which costs $349. If you carry the laptop everywhere it'll
    be susceptible to damage from being jostled around, connectors being plugged and
    unplugged (well maybe not the cool new magnetic power plug), being dropped, having
    beverages spilt into the keyboard, etc. Any of these can be fatal. I've fortunately
    never had to use AppleCare. However, there are many Mac users at my workplace
    and several report excellent repair service under AppleCare.\r\n\r\nThese do add
    significantly to the cost of the machine. I recommend you factor backups and AppleCare
    into the cost of any new machine that you buy. Whatever you decide, happy Mac'ing!
    I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\r\n\r\ns'marks\r\n"

    I've set up. This is something that an average user can figure out, no deep technical
    knowledge necessary. If my drive is stolen, destroyed, etc. I'll just get a new
    one and clone my data over. I try to do this every month or so. I usually set
    it to clone before I go to bed, it takes 30min or so....\r\nI recommend it. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    I don't buy Applecare. I don't necessarily think it's a bad idea, it's just that
    its just that I'm not sure that I'll get my money out of it. Apple products already
    have a warranty. "
