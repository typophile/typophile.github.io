		<div class="commentbody">For the same reason that new car design was suspended during WWII, new typeface design was not the primary thought going then. The type in use was from prior decades and what was available. The Library of Congress and the National Archives have collections of material printed during that time. I am sure there must be comparable collections in European libraries as well.

That might be an option too; looking up Nazi propaganda and reporting on it's typography. It might be the only thing they did well, market themselves. Course, that'll be a hard sell these days.

		<div class="commentbody">Reggie – James is right about this; type-related design history on the web is in its infancy and there isn't much of it around, so you need to <em>physically</em> relocate yourself to a real bricks n'mortar library. Two books that have the same '20th-century-decade-by-decade' structure are 20th century type:remix by Lewis Blackwell (1998, Laurence King Publishing, London UK) and the earlier Graphic Design Sourcebook by Liz McQuiston and Barry Kitts (1987, Quarto Publishing, London UK). Both of them have a chapter devoted to the 1940s.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I suggest you look for "old paper" shops in your area.
There is a subculture of people who collect and deal old paper ephemera -- comic books, posters, postcards, timetables, maps, stamps, money, certificates, (car) manuals, programs as well as magazines and newspapers. 

Alternatively, on the internet, search for well-known magazines.
Scientific American, National Geographic, Vogue, Mademoiselle.
Just enter "Fortune magazine 1945" - I just did and it's $4 on ebay. That magazine will have a sh!t-load of ads which will tell you much of what you need to know.

Check out these pages (scroll down)
http://www.americanartarchives.com/dohanos.htm

To identify and date the fonts in ads, use Matt McGrew's "American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century" (Oak Knoll), which is remarkably comprehensive. If an ad "type" isn't in there, it's probably hand lettering.</div>

An incident that has not been mentioned but one that had an enormous impact on the release of typeface designs (and a great many other things) from the very late 1920s through the War and into the late 1940s was this thing called the Great Depression, a succession of lengthly back to back recessions that essentially crippled world trade and economics, and basically led to World War as a solution. In this case, statistics don't lie, as much as they reveal.

Indeed the British had a better sense for typographic identity. In a little exhibition of WWII leaflets which I saw one could at once tell which were British: Gill Sans.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)

As to your first remark, a book shows such a leaflet which bears the handwritten note "distributed together with ration cards".

An obvious place to start would be magazines from that decade. Your local library probably has bound collections of '40s periodicals. And a little digging will yield online collections like this one:

Scroll down to the '40s to see ads for Palmolive, Nestles, Eve, Ovaltine, Snowfire, Mum, Solidex...</div>
