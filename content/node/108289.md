  body: Philippe C. - one of the original MyFonts forum moderators and a self-publisher
    of the three volume Type Index - indicates that Beatsville was originally shareware
    by Jim Morton. That 1990's freeware and shareware was prime fodder for the ripoff
    companies. "Converted by ALLTYPE" is what was seen in those old nonprofessional
    conversions from the original Mac fonts.
