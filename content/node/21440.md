  body: "Depend on what you mean with the \"letter weights\"? The logo itself looks
    alright. I would overall loosen up the kerning a bit. Otherwise you'll get problem
    in smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: You have a problem with the OIN spacing unless you want the 60's look. Its
    way to tight

    it seems a little narrow next to the airier characters.\r\nTim"

  body: You might also look at the height of the "N". In smaller sizes it appears
    shorter than the rest of the letters (even though it aligns mathematically with
    the rest). Pulling the points just above and below the cap and base lines will
    give the illusion of the right height.
