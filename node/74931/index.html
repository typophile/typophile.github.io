  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Q: What faces would you use to set an edition of Lewis Carroll's <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland<em>?
<!--break-->
It's a really fun challenge – setting a text that gives you a license to get fanciful, but trying to do so tastefully. I'd love some feedback and additional ideas for the choice of faces.

I feel like you need at least a second face for display, and possibly a third for drop caps – I feel like you need drop caps in Alice, but I'm reluctant to use the same face as the text (too dull) or chapter names (too repetitive).

Beyond that, the iconic words "EAT ME" and "DRINK ME" in the text seem to cry out for a special, decorative treatment, but four faces is getting pretty ridiculous. Perhaps one should just make do with letterspaced caps/smallcaps. Also: I'm inclined to use the text face for the running headers and folios, though that's not beyond question either.

<strong>Text</strong>
My current top candidate is, to my surprise, some kind of Bodoni for the text. It never would've occurred to me, but I've seen a couple editions set in Bodoni, and thought it worked surprisingly well. (I tried Bulmer for awhile, to at least get the country of origin to match, but it wasn't nearly as good.) 

I originally wanted to use something 21st century, and my very first thought was [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=info|Dolly]], but I don't think it captures enough of the mystery of the story – it sort of domesticates it. I feel the same way about [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_clifford_pro/|Clifford]] to a lesser extent, though I'm still considering it. In the Bodoni vein, I also considered Nick's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/bodoni-egyptian/|Bodoni Egyptian]] and Emigre's [[http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=97|Filosofia]], but the former doesn't seem suited for book-length text, and the latter seemed too fancy, for lack of a better word.

<strong>Display & drop caps</strong>
This largely depends on the text decision, but taken in isolation I'm thinking about Dear Sarah for display. For the drop caps, if I stick with a Bodoni, I'm inclining towards [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/wiescher/bodoni_classic_deco_roman/|Bodoni Classic Deco]], to avoid juxtaposing modern and non-modern letterforms so close together. Also because it looks nice :)

I await your thoughts eagerly...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would consider setting <em>The Mouse's Tale</em> as being the acid test for the text face.
That would require some serious metafonting.

The other poems are in italic, so that's important too.

Also the relationship between the type and illustrations is crucial.
Tenniel's went very well with a Scotch.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a Puffin edition of the book, first published in the 1940s, then reissued in the 1960s, which is nicely set in Monotype Scotch Roman, a type that, altought cut in the early 1800s, seems to fit well with Carrol's Victorian mood. But I'm not sure that the current digital version is sturdy enough. If you want a contemporary usable Scotch, you can't go wrong with Miller; olther choices would be Nick Shinn's Scotch Modern and James Mosley's New Scotch (which I don't think is available for licensing, anyway). Also Hercules, by František Štorm, comes to mind.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Nicola – yes, I'm thinking about Nick's Scotch Modern, and also Coen Hofmann's [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/urw/sax_volume_ot_std/|Sax]], which lacks the optical scaling of the former (which would come in handy for the Mouse's Tale as Nick perhaps was implying), but does have small caps I would find handy. And I agree, the digital MT Scotch Roman is underwhelming.

And I like Miller, but I think I'm going for a period look now, and it looks too contemporary (my immediate reaction when I see it is "Boston Globe"). Hercules I considered, but I couldn't swallow its idiosyncrasies, like the "d" glyph.

It probably goes without saying that "Dear Sarah" is right out :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, do you mean the genre, or MT Scotch Roman in particular? 

One of the biggest problems I have with the latter, for this book, is the italic v and w glyphs, which come up a lot in the first few pages. Compare:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scotchmodern_3998.gif]

(Scotch Modern)

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sax_6011.gif]

(Sax)

With:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scotchroman_3680.gif]

(MT Scotch Roman)

I associate the top two much more strongly with turn of the century children's books, e.g. the Alice edition I'm looking at and McGuffey Readers (pic).

		<div class="commentbody">I meant the genre, as I don't know them well enough to choose between them. In your above examples, the feeling of Nick's Scotch Modern looks perfect to me for this use, and also better drawn than Sax—both more stylish and more even in color. I don't know how it sets at small sizes, but as Nick has a text size, I assume it would work well, so long as it is not too tiny. Also, how much is in italic? I would think the roman is more important. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Monotype feels a bit off to me in the roman as well – it's just harder to put my finger on why. It seems too relaxed, or something. The "R" and "a" are part of it:

The main thing keeping me back from Scotch Modern is the higher cost, frankly – I gave myself a moratorium on major font purchases a couple weeks ago until this project launches. Perhaps I'll go with Sax and "upgrade" to Scotch Modern later on. It's print on demand, so that would be feasible.</div>

What do you mean by "especially if you're printing digitally?" How does the quality of print on demand (what I'm using, and what I assume you meant by "digitally") differ from offset? I haven't done a detailed comparison, but I haven't noticed any differences so far.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Zach - not a difference in terms of quality *per se* but in terms of result, meaning how typefaces look on paper when printed digitally and offset. In my experience, digital print can achieve great results (considering its low cost), but, generally speaking, tyepaces look "thinner" and "colder" (I don't know a better espression, sorry) than in offest printing. So, a sturdier, less contrasted typeface could work well in digital print too.</div>

I don't get the "thinner" part, as laser printers are usually lower resolution, and fill in corners etc. a bit. Does digital print have higher resolution? Is it grayer than offset? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">We're going offtopic, since this post was about type choice for Alice in Wonderland; anyway, to try to make my point clearer, I took a couple of shots at pages I set and printed offset and digitally - here the difference is perhaps slightly noticeable, but, in general terms, I have the impression that digital print (fist picture) has a tendency to "dry" the type (hence my "colder" and "thinner" definitions), while offset print (second picture) lets the ink expand more around the letter shapes; though, in this specific example, this could also be a consequence of paper permeability.
