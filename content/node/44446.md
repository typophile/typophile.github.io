  school i\xB4m in a typographic project. The students may analise a typeface (their
  structure, composition and so on). I decided to deal with Chaparral. But i couldn\xB4t
  find much about that typeface. I also need some information about Carol Twombly
  who created Chaparral. Maybe one of you can help me. Any advice would further. \r\n\r\nThank
  you for any information\r\nRegina"

    nasty edges.

    decided to take Chaparral because of its characteristic features. The results
    of our studies are important."

  body: "Hi Regina!\r\n[Ignore Claus, he\u2019s just making fun of a certain misspelled
    word ;-)]\r\n\r\nFor [[Carol Twombly]], consult the wiki. And check out <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/32680\">this
    thread</a>.\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of quotes on Chaparral, from typophiles.
    It seems to be quite a polarising face. I, for one, like it very much (using it
    for my stationery & stuff).\r\n\r\n<cite>I keep trying to use it and it always
    seems to fall short. I can\u2019t articulate why.</cite> \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/39592#comment-244492\">Patty</a>\r\n\r\n<cite>Chaparral
    [\u2026] could end up as a standard children\u2019s font for me.</cite> \u2014
    <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/42632#comment-262630\">Malte</a>\r\n\r\n<cite>Chaparral
    is hard to use well, for sure.</cite> \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/39592#comment-244574\">Will</a>\r\n\r\n<cite>Chaparral
    is probably the only slab that has optical sizes. I do have to say that it\u2019s
    really versatile, though it\u2019s not exactly a Scala-kind-of-workhorse.</cite>
    \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/28288#comment-159471\">Bram</a>\r\n\r\nWhat
    ONE typeface would you have rather not exist? <cite>Chaparral. Ok, you beat me
    up for this one.</cite> \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/36352#comment-222258\">Thomas</a>\r\n\r\n<cite>[[Elements
    of Typographic Style|Bringhurst]] does mention Chaparral in his list of types.
    And since he mentions so relatively few types, that means he gave it his seal
    of approval.</cite> \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/29407#comment-168386\">Reed</a>\r\n(Bringhurst\u2019s
    <em>The Solid Form of Language</em> is set in Chaparral.)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlus:
    some unisonous thoughts about pairing:\r\n<cite>Auto is sort of a Chaparral Sans.</cite>
    \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/38561#comment-236149\">Stewf</a>\r\n<cite>The
    informal shapes of Chaparral will probably play real nice with Auto.</cite> \u2014
