  body: "This Italian lettering reminded me of the underlying letterforms of the Ferrari
    logo, which has been made into a font by Michael Hagmann as Ferro Rosso http://www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=ferro_rosso&text=P+I+A+N+O+F+O+R+T+I
    \ Clip the length of the serifs and automotive styling overlapping bars, add a
    few serifs where they are missing and it would look fairly close if you edited
    the leg on R.\r\nPresumably if there is a closer matching font one of the other
    font detectives will tell you about it.\r\nDon"
