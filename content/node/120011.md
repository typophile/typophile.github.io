body: I need to match the lettering on this rubbing on a cemetery marker. Most fonts
  used on the cemetery industry are created using a CAD system, and don't always have
  counterparts in the print/web typography realm. In this case, the type used on the
  stone does not match those in the CAD library at the monument company, so I tried
  to find on match in my personal type library. Best I can do is Aldus, though it
  is not heavy enough, and the bold version I found online is too bold. I am also
  noticing that the x-height of the rubbing is a bit shorter, and the counters are
  a bit more open, more round.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/goyette-2_4970.jpg]

  body: It's definitely Aldus, and once upon a time there was a light weight of it,
    but I can't locate a retailer.

    think the x-height proportion is better...\r\n(Note that some letter details could

  body: "Just out of curiosity, what year was the marker made? I actually used to
    work in the monument industry, and I might be able to help. Are you sure that
    it was manufactured by a company that was using a CAD program? I know that up
    until the mid-90's, a lot of the smaller ones still used the punches.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I had a whole lot of no fun trying to match fonts (for the purpose of engraving
    death dates, etc), and if it was only a couple of characters, I found it to be
    easier in the long run just to modify the closest match i could find. I know that's
    not the answer you were hoping for, but that's just my personal experience."

  body: I think it's definitely Palatino. Maybe what's not clear here is the type
    in white is what I set in Aldus, and the type I need to match is the rubbing (what
    you see reversed in the blue). I'm not sure when it was made, but I think it's
    probably as you say...not manufactured with the CAD system. So...regarding the
    Palatino...it still looks to me like the regular weight is too light and the bold
    is too heavy. Maybe there's a semi-bold on the market...I haven't looked. Or maybe
    I'll have to modify what I have. Thank you all for the comments and consider this
    case closed.
