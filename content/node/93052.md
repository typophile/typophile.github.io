  department last week when it was discovered that a line of Middle English poetry
  quoted in a piece by Peter Hessler about standing in police lineups had a thorn
  in it. Usually a thorn, like a splinter, is something you want to remove, with tweezers,
  or maybe a sterile needle, but this thorn was something we wanted desperately to
  insert ....\"\r\nwww.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/05/the-thorn-in-the-new-yorker.html#entry-more\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/The

    represented by these letters were allographs, so their use in spelling was never
    consistent. Either letter might be indiscriminately used to represent either a
    voiced or unvoiced dental fricative."
