  I am trying to identify this font taken from a scroll. The text on it:\r\nPicture
  1 -> Enza and Franco\r\nPicture 2 -> Via L.\r\nPicture 3 -> C Tel.\r\nI have no
  idea which font can be, thanks a lot\r\n"

    more information about the source documents (specifically, their age)?"

    but the \"E\" is different.\r\n\r\nTried also \"[[http://www.azfonts.net/load_font/e111agio.html|English
    111 Adagio BT Regular]]\", \"[[http://www.linotype.com/1083858/English111StdVivace-product.html|English
    111 Vivace]]\", and \"[[http://www.identifont.com/similar?28AH|Gamundia Pro]]\",
    but they are not the same... I have no idea about the age: it's like a business
    card.\r\n\r\n\"<em>Andantino script</em>\" seems to be the best match, also if
    it isn't the exact font."

    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ambassador-script/ a digital version of
    Aldo Novarese's \u201Ctipo inglese\u201D Juliet typeface. Note the more upright
    stance is a better match than the inclination of the other scripts mentioned.
    Clip off some of the flourishing and its fairly close to your card. It even has
    the crossed _z_ used in your presumably Italian -- based on the phrase _Enza e
    Franco_ and the word _Via_ -- Business card. \r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "I should have mentioned that most of the old business and other cards I see
    in this forum are engraved or lithographed rather than a typeface.\r\nLooking
    at the lack of connecting lines, which are easy to do in engraving and lithography,
    I believe that this is probably a metal jobbing font for letterpress work on cards.\r\nIn
    my opinion it is either a simplified Juliet or a font created with the same idea
    of making a version of English script that would be robust enough to stand up
    to letterpress printing of cards. Typefaces with hairline connections were notoriously
    fragile and it made sense to omit them whenever possible.\r\nDon"
