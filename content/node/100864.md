body: "Hello everyone, this is my first post here. I couldn't figure out this font
  with whatthefont or identifont or the help of a few co-workers, or going through
  my whole font library one at a time, so I ask if you recognize this font.\r\n\r\nI
  have a photo of the font, and a version where I blackened a selection of the letters,
  and a version where I blackened and sheared the letters back to an angle that seemed
  non-italicized. Thanks guys.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Service_C_4575.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Service_C_blackened_5915.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Service_C_blackened_and_sheared_4681.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/968652_6443.JPG]"
