body: "I have been reading with interest the \"first three fonts you have bought\"
  thread, and while it is nostalgic, I wonder if a last three fonts you have bought
  might be more useful, in letting people know what fonts out there are hot.\r\n\r\nSadly,
  I can't offer much personal information, as I have not been buying fonts much lately.
  I did get Paradigm from Shinntype a couple years back, but other than that, my font
  desires have been Adobe bonus fonts like Brioso and Garamond Pro."
