    Type Tester is. (My tech guy wasn't able to get the job done in time to coincide
    with the Featured Face advertising, but any day now.) However, there are links
    to a comprehensive PDF specimen, or click <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Pratt.pdf\">here</a>
    for the specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick, coming from a total beginner's perspective: Would you mind telling
    where the shape of Pratt's \"k\" comes from? Those look like some funky angles.&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)\r\n\r\nYou
    might have already been alerted to the fact that there is a punctuation error
    in the German sample text. In the second line from the bottom of p.22 of your
    PDF, there should be a hyphen followed by a word space instead of the dash (\"Rede-
    und Glaubensfreiheit\")."
