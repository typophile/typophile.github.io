body: "[[Ingo Preuss]] released his ultra fat family BATTISTA coming in OpenType format
  and in five styles: Regular, Italic, Open, Stroke & Ornate.  \r\n\r\nThe BATTISTA
  typeface stands in the long tradition of the designs developed by Giambattista Bodoni,
  who made his famous typefaces in the end of the eighteenth century. Similar designs
  can be found on various specimen books e.g. Alexander Wilson, John Bell, Edmund
  Fry and Alexander Thibaudeau. One of the best italics was available by Stephenson
  Blake & Co. foundry form Sheffield, England. In the end of the nineteenth century
  an unknown punch cutter at the German type foundry Schelter & Giesecke made an very
  bold cut of this Bodoni design. He brought both designs, the regular and the italic
  to an new level of harmony.\r\n\r\nCompared to the original Bodoni designs the new
  typeface was a lot bolder, which was well taken by the audience in this time. The
  BATTISTA typeface is an remarkable design, assembled of ultra bold and very fine
  shapes, but in all, the spirit of Bodonis design was well preserved.\r\n\r\nHave
  a look to the <a href=\"http://www.preusstype.com/pdf/Battista_web_v101.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">specimen
