  \r\n\r\nI'm new on Typophile. I believe it's a great place\r\nto improve yourself
  while u get inspired at the same time. \r\nSo I really hope to hear a lot from u
  guys in the future.\r\n\r\nAnyway the logo was made for a friend recently. The only
  letters I could\r\nuse were his initials which is AF obviously :). Like the thread\r\ntitle
  shows he's a Motion Artist.\r\n\r\nU can check his site at. http://www.noviax.net\r\nHe
  will change to a new domain very soon with his own name.\r\n\r\nHarsh critism is
  really appreciated!\r\n"
