the client wants a letter C that looks like rope. The reason is because it is fiber and so is textiles. Also, a bomb image is a common design element in the t-shirts, and the rope is supposed to reference the fuse of the bomb.</p>
<p>Here are many versions I&rsquo;ve played around with. 
Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, for I have spent so many hours on this already. Thank you.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention, the client also wants a sewing needle going through the C.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the first one. But you should play a little more with the rope (it&rsquo;s pretty rigid at the moment, especially in the top right corner). Also, you should spell the name fully under it (including initial C).
As for illustrative vs simplified, it depends on display size and means of reproduction (that applies to the tiny type at the bottm too)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like this idea, it seems to work.  I am not sure the distinction you are making between illustrative and simple shapes, in many ways I see this as both.  I would try to illustrate the ends of the rope rather than cut them.  Maybe try a cut perpendicular to the rope, or some sort of ends of the fibers.  I didn&rsquo;t get the bomb idea at all, but there seems to be potential to amp up that aspect.  Good start!  I do like the organic feel of rope weave together with a sort of geometric overall shape.  The needle feels a little like an afterthought.  Looking forward to seeing this develop.</div>

<p>Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t even show the client the third one.</p>
<p>If your client wants tiny details that you know won&rsquo;t reproduce well, you need to educate them about the requirements for a proper logo. Show them how the tiny details become a blur when reduced down to postage stamp size to fit on a business card or in a small ad. And show them examples of good logos which reproduce cleanly in small sizes.</p>
<p>If you do a Google images search for Rope Logo or Thread Logo (or similar phrases) you&rsquo;ll find examples of logos which represent those materials and yet are simple enough to reproduce cleanly in a small size.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This comment comes for an instruction writer for a needlecraft kit manufacturer, not a designer. However, I know fiber and needles. What you are depicting is not rope, it&rsquo;s a braid. Rope is a single twist; it is not interwoven. Look at a piece of rope, twine, or thread for that matter and you will know what I mean. It would also help if you had the &ldquo;rope&rdquo; go more convincingly through the eye of the needle, along with the needle actually piercing the rope. Enlarge the eye if need be. I think this is why some are reading it as a pin instead of a needle. Hope this along with the other comments helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What is the market positioning for the new logo, is there a specific demographic that will be targeted by the brand. To me the name seems to have 2 distinct connotations, the first is that this work is hand crafted, the second - now this may be a local perception - I am a New Zealander - to us, crafty means clever, cunning, normally with a negative spin. In the latter context, it would work well for a street label, in that case it would need attitude. Rereading the first entry I see that you mention a bomb symbol or graphic and T shirts so i assume it is a street brand. If this is the case maybe you need to get a bit more funky, especially if it is a label that you want to built a culture behind. The use of the letters C R F T Y reminds me of the very successful UK brand FCUK.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get caught up in the details before you have worked out the strategy and market positioning of the finished brand. I agree with the other responses that mention issues that can arise from being able to embroider the labels.</p>
<p>I think the needle graphic has some great potential</p>
