  a design education recently \r\n(not graphic, but industrial, so I'm not going to
  claim that I am a graphic designer)\r\n\r\nanyways, my family has a dairy farm,
  and thus as typical, a sign stands at the end of the lane with the farm name etc.\r\n\r\nthe
  sign was old, needing a repaint (at the bare minimum)i of course volunteered to
  give it something of a freshen up\r\n\r\nposted first is the sign before hand (very
  typical or clich\xE9 for the scenario)\r\n\r\nso i felt like giving it a change,
  giving the farm something of a brand identity kinda thing,\r\n\r\ni searched the
  net for some inspiration, and posted is a pic for a horse farm that i kinda used
  as the basis for the design\r\nthus comes the design i came up with and the after
  picture of the sign\r\n\r\nplease critique or comment as you see fit\r\n\r\nthanks"

    cows', where part of the ideal is to have the straight as a ruler back or 'top-line',

    the end of the story, or where things stand currently.\r\n\r\nA few months ago,
    in an instance of local mailbox bashings, the sign was also destroyed (plywood
    construction defeated with drunken force and golf clubs).\r\n\r\nAnyways, so now
    the sign frame stands empty, and my family wanting a new sign.  Of course it would
    be nice to make something a little bit more vandalism proof.  Anyways, I see this
    as an opportunity for a complete revamp on the sign, change up the framing/format
    and everything, meaning that the orientation and layout of the whole kinda graphic
    could change.\r\n\r\nSo this is where I would really appreciate feedback on what
    I have posted thus far, in terms of orientation/layout for how you feel that this
    might be successful.\r\n\r\n-go feedback!!-\r\n\r\nthanks"

    You push the cost of printing up, that is if you are going to print. \r\n\r\nI
    would review your design based on what the industry is doing. Your design is light
    and airy like a boutique selling clothing but is that the image you want to present
    to your target audience. Do they want arty design or bold, productive, safe qualities.
    Its not a bad design but maybe not the right one for your industry."

    set this logo down on the ground, everything would tip over and fall back on the

    Holsteins\u201D to \u201CWellsfarm\u201D has left me not sure how I feel about
