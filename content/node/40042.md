  body: "It's important to note that the location is different from previous meetings.
    The Kensington Pub gets too busy at Christmas time, so we've moved around the
    corner and down a block.\r\n\r\nThe selection of beers isn't as diverse as the
    K-Pub. But we can drink Coronas and eat nachos and talk about rotunda and fraktur,
    and watch all the traffic leaving the downtown core."
