  body: We already had something similar (similar to Peignot Light). If you use the
    Edit link to move the thread up to the main Type ID Board, someone else could
    remember better.

  body: Thank you, I just moved up the post. About the magazine, I just do not remember,
    it was a long time ago. It was just for an article or something, but not the official
    type of the magazine. I did a scan of it, and now that I look at it again, I'd
    like to do something with this type if possible... Thank you in advance for your
    help.

  body: It really looks like it is part of Peignot family (even if it is a mix with
    lowercase), but some things are different, like the R or the S (its curves), and
    every thin lines or curves are even thiner than in the Peignot light. I do not
    have the specific "Peignot demi-bold" but when I check on internet, the letters
    have the same shapes as Peignot light, demi or bold... :(

  body: "Your sample image is a combination of upper and lower case, resized to the
    same height. It may also have had some individual letters' weights altered. Or,
    it's possible (I think unlikely, but would be glad to be wrong) that a matching
    font exists.\r\n\r\nThere are many different implementations of Cassandre's 1937
    Peignot, and some foundries have created more than one version. There are many
    variations, both subtle and major, among these designs; for instance, some have
    a rounded lower case 'w' and some have sharp connections. They include:\r\n\r\nAdobe
    (multiple)\r\nBerthold\r\nFont Company\r\nGeorge Williams\r\nLinotype (multiple)\r\nSWFTE
    (a clone-maker)\r\nURW (multiple, including a set that also has Microsoft as a
    copyright owner)\r\nNumerous implementations that don't include any creator's
    names\r\n\r\nAnd there are implementations with different names:\r\nExotic 350
    (Bitstream)\r\nGreyhound (B&P Graphics / Softmaker)\r\nMontereyFLF (Casady & Greene)\r\nMorris
    (Opti/Castcraft)\r\nPare (Bay Animation - distributed with Broderbund products))\r\nPeignotNeu
    (Watanabe)\r\nPenguin (Corel - may be renamed from URW or Bitstream)\r\nPennsy
    (Primafont)\r\nPenultimate (FontBank)\r\nPenwin (SWFTE)\r\nPenyae (WSI - probably
    a clone)\r\nPeoria (Softmaker)\r\nAn assortment of Southern Software ripoffs (Carnati,
    Creme, Jabot, Paquette) \r\n\r\n"
