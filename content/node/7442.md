    like Emigre&#39;s price structure - generally $100 gets you about 4 styles &#40;italic,
    alternate, sc, etc.&#41; I used to work for a company that bought fonts as needed,
    and we built that into the job budget, but it&#39;s hard to get a client to pony
    up these days. It makes me less likely to experiment with the more outre fonts
    and more inclined to stick with the ones I already have &#40;thousands&#41;, hence
    less exposure for you font designers. <BR> <BR>I love type and do very much appreciate
    all the creativity and hard work that goes into designing a font.

  body: I think usage has something to do with perception of pricing. If you are a
    designer using a font on a one time project it could be seen as expensive, but
    if you are involved with a publication and use it often then its relatively cheep.
    <BR> <BR>But the perception here in New York City is the clients don&#39;t want
    to spend one dime more than they can get away with. The economy isn&#39;t that

  body: To continue what Daniel said, if your client is a corporation or major publisher
    then a font is just a line item in the budget. If your client is an independent
    filmmaker or small restauranteur, they&#39;re not going to be so eager to purchase
    a new font. And those smaller jobs are often the ones that call for more interesting
    type treatments.

  body: 'The way I look at it, current font prices, which hover around $30 per font,
    are a good value. I base this on the price of a sheet of Letraset in 1980 which
    was about $10. If you take into account inflation, this would be about $25 in
    2004 dollars. Modern fonts are a much better value than a sheet of Letraset &#40;unlimited
    characters and sizes, the characters are never crooked, never crack, space themselves
    automatically, huge selection, etc.&#41; and yet they cost only a little more.
    Consider also that a fonts for typesetting machines back then cost hundreds of
    dollars. <BR> <BR>I think that the perception that some have about font prices
    comes from the fact that you get them for free or almost free with operating systems,
    software bundles, etc. combined with all the free fonts given away by hobbyist
    font designers. Both of these cases are unfair comparisons to retail fonts. In
    the first case, this is like saying toasters should be cheaper because your bank
    gives them away when you open a new account. In the second case, hobbyist fonts
    are not usually very well made or complete. <BR> <BR>Ultimately, the price has
    to be low enough that customers will pay it and high enough that font developers
    can make enough to make the effort worthwhile. It seems like it&#39;s there now.
    <BR> <BR>The question I have is: If font prices were substantially lower, would
    substantially more people buy them? In other words, could font developers make
    more money if prices were lower? For instance, if a font is sold at half price,
    I&#39;d have to have more than twice as many orders because my operational overhead
    would go up &#40;more transaction costs, more potential support costs, etc.&#41;.'

  body: I agree with Patricia but I guess it all really comes to the thing that I
    say to my clients... &#34;Good, fast, cheap - choose any two&#34;. That&#39;s
    the reality of most production... sadly, my clients tend to choose &#34;cheap
    and fast&#34;. Oh well, such is life. The thing that I find difficult to incorporate
    into my billing structure is the amount of time I spend font-matching and then
    hunting down some obscure variation of a typeface only to find out that the client
    really has no visual literacy whatsoever. <BR> <BR>Recently, I went through all
    the hassle of doing a &#40;IMHO&#41; spiffy layout with a coehesive and lucid
    use of faces - client comes back with content change - I advise that now it physically
    will not fit on the page - they say... &#34;that&#39;s ok why don&#39;t you just
    squish it all to fit...&#34; Sheesh!  <BR> <BR>The reality of being a designer
    is that you&#39;re not only in competition with other designers, but nowadays
    you&#39;re in competition with the quick-copy down the road, the client&#39;s
    kid who is &#34;really good with computers&#34;, the client&#39;s PA or accounts
    clerk, their partner who did their party invites and everybody said they were
    really great, et al. <BR> <BR>The cost of fonts is reasonable I think - don&#39;t
    get me wrong - but when the difference between getting a job or not comes down
    to a very tight margin, and the fact that most clients are visually illiterate
    from my experience, then I find myself going for the freebies. <BR> <BR>End result?
    <BR> <BR>Font designers get paid a pittance and more visual pollution gets released
    in to the marketplace which then sets a benchmark that is emulated by the copycats...
    gets rather depressing actually. <BR> <BR>Sorry for bringing you down... man.

    license type as often as I dare. My AMEX bill can attest to that. I don&#39;t
    charge my clients for the type. I know I will more than likely use the typefaces
    again. I look at them as a business expense which gets added to this list I show
    to my accountant every year come February. <BR> <BR>Typefaces are another tool.
    Clients don&#39;t necessarily care about them as a tool, perhaps not as much as
    other things, but as a designer it is important to have whatever tools you can
    at your disposal. <BR> <BR>If I were to license a TEFF typeface I would simply

    that $30 is more than reasonable for a single font, and around $100 for a small
    package with a few weights or an italic and an alternate. But some of the more
    boutique foundries charge up to twice that, which usually puts the fonts out of
    my price range. And since I do already have so many fonts, I can nearly always
    find something great in my library. It&#39;s a pity, though, since if they were

    by a friend type designer as a compensation for  <BR>work on his website &#40;proofreading

    purchasing the  <BR>license for a job, in order to support both a foundry I regard  <BR>highly
    and the type designer. The purchase ate away half  <BR>my profit for this particular

  body: In my opinion, most of the time, type is reasonably priced, especially in
    light of how long good type takes to develop. But even as a lover of type sometimes
    type prices can be out of reach for a small studio. Beautiful type like DfType&#39;s
    Rialto costs 570 Euros &#40;and involves a complex bank transfer&#41;, and Lineto
    fonts are like $150 per weight&#40;!&#41;, if I&#39;m reading those prices correctly.  These
    $100 and more a weight prices put these great fonts out of my reach. Perhaps magazines
    and larger studios can afford them. Shouldn&#39;t they be a teensy bit cheaper
    &#40;they&#39;d almost certainly sell more&#41; or is exclusivity a factor here?

    know if it will sell or not. You just have to hope that the fonts will catch somebody&#39;s
    eye.  <BR> <BR>It is a speculative and time-consuming enterprise with no guarantee
    of success. I spend months designing a font or family. One particular typeface
    in my collection &#40;I&#39;m not saying which one&#41; has been on sale for a
    while and hasn&#39;t sold one copy. <BR> <BR>Now if this was the first font I
    had designed for retail I would have been very discouraged by the lack of any
    renumeration and would have probably given it up as a waste of time and effort.
    Fortunately, this wasn&#39;t the case, and I manage to make a living out of type
    design. <BR> <BR>Fonts need to be not sold cheaply so as to encourage designers
