  body: The faux arabic one above could be a cleaned up <a href="http://www.haroldsfonts.com/alhambra.html">Alhambra</a>
    by Harold Lohner. (probably made the e and r more readable)

  body: A bit off topic, but I find the faux Arabic font almost unreadable, may be
    because I keep, subconsciously, trying to interpret it as Arabic.

  body: "Thank you Renko.\r\n\r\nKhaled, your experience is exactly the sort of thing
    I've been warning about for years: when you make one script feel like another
    you're reducing readability, at least for anybody also familiar with the \"imported\"
    script.* The other big reason to avoid such migration is it threatens scripts
    whose survival is at stake.\r\n\r\n* Here's an example of what I'm talking about:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/4986274299/\r\n\r\nTwo
    caveats though:\r\n- In a display font the readability issue is much less important.\r\n-
    For a script that's not threatened importing the feeling of another script can
    actually enrich things. For example Sakkal Majalla is pretty cool in my book.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "@Hrant:\r\nIndeed, I've never like the so called type \"matchmaking\"; trying
    to make two independent scripts with entirely different traditions does not make
    a \"good match\" but rather creates an ugly Frankenstein-like monster. It does
    not solve a problem, it rather creates one and fails to solve."

    to understand why someone would do that.\r\n\r\nI do really love the bottom font
    though, it's much more interesting and aesthetically pleasing."

  body: "I am impressed with the swift identification of Akira's! Kudos to his smart
    eyes and Renko's sharp eyes as well!\r\n\r\nVery interesting topic Hrant. Thank
    you for bringing it up. It is interesting to hear the natives' opinions too. \r\n\r\nI
    gather it is inevitable - the typographic interventions and mutilations will carry
    on, on the most beautiful scripts to make them look like acceptable(!) and recognisable
    for the Latin world. One might think it as an act of hybrid processing. But the
    horrific Frankenstein analogy, it is so shocking to think of. Unfortunately the
    consequences of mutated script is so alien and meaningless for the natives and
    only make the Latin world feel themselves clever/safe so they can read what actually
    it means/says in the script. Just like the Abu Dhabi airport logo above."
