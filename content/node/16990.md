  body: Maybe not as bleeding-edge as Cholla -- and I do like Cholla -- but you could
    look at <a href="http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Dispatch">Dispatch</a> from Font
    Bureau.

  body: "Nice suggestions so far. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=EF.119097.0.0\">Serifa</a>
    is a little less rigid than Stymie and better for text.\r\nMaybe it's too obvious,
    but <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.108156.0.0\">ITC Officina</a>
    might be right here."

  body: could you not just adjust the "e" to your liking? If that is the typeface
    you like and are having trouble finding one that can be an alternative... seems
    like the easiest thing to do.
