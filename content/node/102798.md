  on this word mark that I'm in process on for a client. (Created by heavily modifying
  Carisma Light (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/carisma/  in case anyone
  was curious)  Any thoughts are appreciated guys, thank you,\r\nm [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Truffle_Wordmark_02_4669.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Truffle_Wordmark_5417.jpg]"

    to be getting thicker as it goes out, looking unpleasant.\r\n- That diamond thing
    is cool, but too strong - I'd make it smaller and/or thinner.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant,\r\nThanks for the feedback...Yeah I'm struggling with the U :(  Any
    specific ideas on how to improve the letterform? When you say \"thicker as it
    goes out\" is it possible to provide a bit more details? Thanks, I appreciate
    you taking the time to comment.\r\nm"

  body: "\"U\": I'd have to do it myself, for a fee. You're probably better off doing
    it yourself, maybe by looking at existing similar designs.\r\n\r\n\"R\": The part
    where it curls looks thicker than the the part that joins the bowl. Easy enough
    to fix.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The T is almost dropping of the shelf\u2026 The F twins should be every so
    slightly closer to each other (as twins usually are).\r\nThe bowl of the U could
    be smoother where it connects to the verticals. The J overshoots \u2014 maybe
    a rendering issue.\r\n\r\nMinor problems, easily solved. (BTW: check your designs
    by holding the print upside down, scrutinize it in a mirror. This really helps
    you notice stuff.)"
