  16 x 16.\r\n\r\nIs that possible considering the complexities of Arabic ?\r\n\r\nAll
  suggestions welcome\r\n\r\nTony\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you Jens.\r\n\r\nI have had a look at the Al Abdali 8 font and from
    what I can see it looks promising.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that working with .ttf
    and .otf Font files, other than installing them into Windows, is something new
    to me, and I am having trouble seeing the form of the individual characters.  Trying
    to insert each character into MS word is causing Word to crash.\r\n\r\nThe system
    into which I want to build the font, is an OEM piece of equipment with embedded
    firmware. It runs a 192 x 64 pixel display user interface, displaying pregenerated
    English text strings from within the embedded code.  The user can also select
    to change to French, German, Spanish, etc. and we have had relative strings simply
    translated into the appropiate languages and stored in the code.\r\n\r\nWhen it
    comes to Russian, Greek, or Chinese, we have generated a bitmap look-up table
    for each character to be displayed. \r\n\r\nIdeally, I was hoping to do the same
    thing for Arabic message strings that have already been correctly constructed,
    but to do this I need to be able to see the full form of each character and it's
    code within the font table in order to generate the bitmap look-up table. \r\n\r\nOther
    than downloading the Al Abdali font file, I have so far been unable to find any
    other information, or make progress.\r\n\r\nAny advice, please\r\n\r\nTony\r\n\r\n"
