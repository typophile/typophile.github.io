body: i am having a problem, when i try to generate the fonts, i get a message telling
  me i have open contours in some of the glyphs and they are highlighted in pink.
  the problem is that i cant actually find the open contour in the glyph. is there
  an easy way of doing this?

  body: Caleb, this often means that you have a stray single point somewhere in the
    glyph. This may be on top of another point, making it invisible. Try running Remove
    Overlap on the outline.
