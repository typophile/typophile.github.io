  reading of Robert Bringhurst's \"The elements of typographic style\". Chapter 8,
  about shaping the page, was fascinating. I really enjoyed grid systems theories.
  However, I keep on wondering about modular scales. \r\nIs anyone knowledgeable enough
  to give me a little run down on how to create one?\r\nWhy doesn't the Half Pica
  Modular Scale contains the number 52?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance :)"

  body: "It doesn't contain 52 because it is a Fibonacci scale, the sum of the two
    preceding numbers equals the next number, therefore in the scale (21+34=55). The
    ratio 1:<em>phi</em> 1.61803 (the ratio of the Golden Section) when rounded up
    to whole numbers applied to, for example, 5 gives 5 x 1.61803 = 8 so that page
    size/text block would be 5 x 8. By working backwards and forwards applying the
    formula of the preceding two numbers equal the next number gives a scale 0, 1,
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89... \r\nTim \r\n"

  body: "hello tim,\r\nthanks for your reply. you seem to be a very knowledgeable
    person. I am not a designer, I'm just interested in grid systems and modular scale
    after reading a few books by Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\nDo you have a copy of \u201CThe
    elements of typographic style\u201D? I am still wondering why, in his example
    of a page shaped with a modular scale, the author used the measure 52 for one
    of the page side since this number doesn't appear in the half pica modular scale.
    Could you maybe shed some lights on this?\r\n\r\n:)"

    yesterday, I didn't have the book with me at work. The illustration you refer
    to gains its dimensions from the text block and the margins, so for the height
    you have 5+42+8=55picas, while the width is 5+42+5=52picas, the margins using
    the modular scale. \r\n\r\nThe key to all grids though is later in the chapter
    \u2013 section 8.8 improvisations & adjustments, writers will not comply with
    your grid all the time and the text is more important than the design. The fact
    is that grids only serve as guides and the pages will nearly always benefit from
    a good eye.\r\nTim"
