body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I was wondering if anyone had any idea what the font Abbey have
  used in their new logo, the original would obviously not have the fading &#40;?&#41;!!
  <BR> <BR>Any Ideas? <BR> <BR>Here are some links... <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.abbeyforintermediaries.co.uk/WMintermediarygateway/Images/logo.gif"

  body: That was my first thought too, Nicolai, but if you watch closely  <BR>you&#39;ll
    notice that the flaring of the endings of the characters is  <BR>solely the result
    of that naff fading. We&#39;re looking for something  <BR>more akin <a href="http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PTriB.html"

  body: I think the font may be Linotype&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/aspect-intro-lt/intro/testdrive.html?s=abbey&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">&#34;Apect Intro&#34;</a>. Does that look like it?

  body: Nah, I can see it&#39;s similar, but when I get them on screen together, they&#39;re
    not the same, even if you added weight to it. Never mind :-&#40;

  body: Could it be custom made? <BR> <BR>I ran through the FontBook, MyFonts and
    T-26 <BR>without any luck - <b>what a complete waste of time!</b> <BR> <BR>Do
    I hear anybody saying &#34;get a life&#34;?

    though. <BR>They used my Bryant for the rest. <BR> <BR>From the Winter catalog:

  body: Eric, I <i>really</i> love Bryant. It&#39;s so... so... smooth.Like a  <BR>baby&#39;s
    bum, but with lots of character. Me likes a lot! <BR> <BR>BTW Nicolai I think
    more than a couple of us can say  <BR>we have a similar life... And quite a few
    visitors thank  <BR>us for that! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
