  screen grabs of the same text, set in the same font (.otf, Type 1 outlines) with
  some variation in hinting settings.\r\nAt left is TextEdit, showing the way the

  bottom type face is \"properly\" hinted with stem widths and alignment zones (generating
  with no hints at all produces a similar result).\r\nI find it much too weak and
  blurry, and would prefer something stronger, like in TextEdit.\r\nThe only way I
  could achieve something like that was by giving the stem widths \"crazy\", very
  narrow values - that's the top font in the CS specimens. I hesitate to do that,
  in case Adobe changes its rendering engine in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat's going on
  -- why does CS over-ride Apple's rasterizing with something that, at least for this
  typeface, is inferior?\r\n\r\nOr have I missed something important in the production
  process?\r\n\r\n"

    creative suite apps use their own Adobe rasterizer, and thereby get consistent
    screen rendering across all platforms they run on. This has been true for many
    years - going back to Illustrator 7, Photoshop 5, and InDesign 1.\r\n\r\nI can't

  body: "Also, I believe that the Apple rasterizer completely ignores hints. I think
    it does some smart supersampling, i.e. rasterizes the glyphs at, say, 2x the actual
    size and then applies its very efficient antialiasing to scale the glyphs down.
    It seems that this is why you don't see any changes when you change the stem values.
    \r\n\r\nThe Apple rasterizer has a tendency to draw type \"more readable\", i.e.
    very often, simply \"bolder\". This is obvious with Apple's goal at hand: the
    best screen readability possible. On the other hand, Adobe's goals are different,
    at least in InDesign and Acrobat: to simulate the print appearance as good as
    possible. This is why type may be drawn lighter (with accurate hinting) because
    the Adobe rastierizer tries to balance two aims: on one hand, make the type readable
    on screen, on the other hand, show the fonts in an appropriate relation to bitmaps,
    outline drawings etc. that appear in the project. \r\n\r\nPlease note that if
    you open a PDF in Apple's Preview, it usually gives you good on-screen reading
    experience but it does not accurately reflect the actual relations between the
    type weight and the other elements of the publication. So if you used Preview's
    appearance as a preview for what you'll get in print, you may end up being bitterly
    disappointed. \r\n\r\nA."

    in Adobe's defence, I must say that now that I've figured out a rendering for
    this font on CS for the Mac, I don't have to worry how it will look in CS on a
    PC, and these hinting settings should be OK for Word as well. \r\n\r\nStefan,
    what is the font used in your sample? If it's not an Adobe font, some of the onus
    for its performance may fall on the foundry that produced it.\r\n\r\nWith regards
    to Didone types, Apple's system font Didot renders weakly in both the OS apps
    (eg Textedit) and CS apps -- it seems that there is no hinting, the assumption
    being that the system will take care of everything."

    Thomas, CoolType makes a big improvement -- but it would help if it were device
    sensitive -- it is off by default on my Apple LCD monitor, and one has to find
    the \"Smoothing\" option in the Acrobat Preferences, from among 27 items, some
    of which have more promising names, such as Reading and Page Display. When one
    sees the effect of CoolType, it's more Sharpening than Smoothing."

    a tradeoff indeed. It's the result of the grid-fitting process. The hints act
    as guides to the rasterizer, telling it how the outlines can be adjusted/distorted
    so that more pixels can be completely turned off (i.e. made black), and thus making
    the resulting raster-letterforms appear crisp.\r\nNot allowing grid-fitting will
    result in blurrier letter-images.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting observation as

    looking at its lettershapes onscreen at very large magnification. "
