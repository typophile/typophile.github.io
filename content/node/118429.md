      is a mixed bag of many eras: Italian and French Renaissance, English designers
      of the XVIII th  and XIX th century. In my introduction message and through
      my examples, I implied the category known as \"garaldes\" (Garamont+Alde Manuce).
      Basically, the XVI th century even though Manuce belonged to the late XV th
      century. Garamont studied his craft through the books published by Manuce but
      changed and polished the general design of the letters: see, as one example,
      the horizontal cross bar of the lowercase \"e\" with no beak. As Jean Jannon
      and Christoffel Van Dijck, Caslon followed the template of Claude Garamont's
      roman.\r\n\r\n\xB6 Your selection is narrowed down to:\r\nBembo\r\nPoliphilus\r\nGaramond
      (Jean Jannon)\r\nPlantin\r\nAldus\r\nGoudy Old Style\r\nPalatino\r\nImprint
      (neo-Caslon)\r\nAdobe Caslon\r\n\r\n\r\n\xB6 I have some doubts about this typeface:\r\nAntique
      Old Style (re-named Bookman Oldstyle)\r\nGaralde or Transitional? I can't say."

    for the task at hand.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes right down to it, I don't have any

  body: I have seen one page - Martin Silvertant's - which classifies Caslon as a
    Garalde. That surprised me; I would have thought that it, like the Dutch old styles
    such as Plantin are instead on the border of being Transitional like Baskerville,
    and so they're old style but not belonging to the specific category of typefaces
    like the Garamonds.

    Caslon is an odd case because it can be classified in both garaldes and transitional

    as a transitional, given that it was very much a direct ancestor - even more so
    than Baskerville, on which Updike heaped blame - of Bodoni.
