  be clean, no gimmicky stuff.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    strikes me as quite happy, but maybe that's just me. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/4383370158/>(It
    has a bit of a crazy smile.)</a>\r\n\r\nBut really, this depends such a lot on
    context. If the rest of your mailer is \xABfunny\xBB maybe you'll need a very
    dry font to not let it get too silly. If the layout is \xABdry\xBB the type has
    to work more. Quite hard to suggest fonts out of the blue.\r\nAlso: How much text,
    how large?"
