  body: "As I pointed out in the old thread about this that got nuked, I\u2019m pretty
    sure this is all about the human capital. Veer knows how to build a great stock
    library, how to market it, and how to sell it. Corbis sucks at most of that (excluding
    the massive historic image library) and I\u2019m sure that Veer\u2019s success
    is hurting them. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the Corbis stock images moved
    under the Veer brand with the historic stuff treated as another stock library
    Veer licenses and sells. As for the type, given the way Corbis has been built
    up via acquisition, maybe those TYPE stock certificates will become collector\u2019s
    items in the future\u2026"

  body: "So, Veer is now owned by Bill Gates. That sounds about right. Veer doesn't
    have illustrators, photographers, film-makers, or type designers on staff; they
    are a vendor. Type is a commodity, like stock illustration, photography, or footage.
    It's there to be sold. It's all about the bottom line. While the Veer type library
    is \"curated\" unlike the free-for-all at MyFonts, the result is the same. Another
    \"independent foundry\" bites the dust? Don't make me laugh.\r\n"

    some graphic designers in-house to make their marketing materials, this is not
    the same as having actual content development taking place in-house.\r\n\r\nI
    can't find any webpages showing any of Mr Hutchinson's published designs. Therefore,
    I feel pretty safe in stating that he is not a type designer.\r\n\r\nThere is
    nothing wrong with being a vendor. Making stuff is hard; it's much easier to just
    sell it."

  body: "Hello folks.\r\n\r\nI wish I could have stuck my nose into this thread a
    bit sooner. I was just waiting for a bit of the dust from last week\u2019s news
    to settle.\r\n\r\nYes, everything is indeed good.\r\n\r\nAs an addendum to the
    clarifications by Nick, Stephen and Ricardo (thank you all), I would like to reinforce
    the fact that Veer does have a large in-house stock photography production and
    art department. We are currently building out four brands of photography: Fancy
    [1], Solus [2], Dear [3], and the Latin-American focused Somos [4].\r\n\r\n[1]

    http://www.veer.com/somos/\r\n\r\nAs for typeface development, I am but the sole
    type designer (of sorts) and technician on staff. However, we work very closely
    with Jason Walcott on adding new faces to our Jukebox [5] collection. Likewise,
    Alejandro Paul, Stephen Rapp, Christian Robertson and others are all significant
    contributors to the exclusive typefaces in our Umbrella [6] library. This year,
    we acquired the Mean Tangerine [7] foundry for its solid lineup of pixel fonts,
    and are working with Tyler Young, continuing to build out this great collection.
    Finally, we just soft-launched Cabinet [8], an embryonic new collection of text
    and titling faces - Stefan Hattenbach of Macrhino is producing exclusive families
    for us in this context.\r\n\r\n[5] http://www.veer.com/jukebox/\r\n[6] http://www.veer.com/umbrella/\r\n[7]

    we\u2019ve been busy.\r\n\r\n<strong>@Jonathan</strong> We\u2019re still cool.
    I promise that isn\u2019t about to change.\r\n\r\n<strong>@Si</strong> I\u2019m
    truly sorry about the lack of catalogues ... I honestly can\u2019t explain why
    you never see them. It\u2019s not like we have a zip code block on Redmond.\r\n\r\n<strong>@James</strong>
    No apologies needed. Although I think it may have been me riffing on the work
    of the mid-80s Mr Brody, rather than the other way around. I was a very impressionable
    apr\xE9s art college grad.\r\n\r\nA more recent example of by type design exploits
    can be witnessed in this Type Battle: Triline Pixel Font\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/battle03"
