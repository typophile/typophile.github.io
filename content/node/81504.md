    around a couple of local grocery stores. Here are the ones I found:\r\n\r\nVika
    crispbread (bordeline, I guess):\r\nhttp://www.vika-brod.se/Vika%20prima.jpg\r\n\r\nBavaria
    Blu cheese:\r\nhttp://www.bergader.de/en/bavaria-blu-fitness.jpg\r\n\r\nBratwurst
    from Scan:\r\nhttp://www.matservice.se/bilder/stora/7300206706007.jpg\r\n\r\nCasademont,

    Kastelholm cheese (Okay, not blackletter, but I thought it interesting to include
    anyway):\r\nhttp://www.aca.ax/files/kastelholm.png\r\n\r\nEl Antiguo brand Turr\xF3n:\r\nhttp://www.oliveria.com.au/Uploads/oliveriaWebImg_0088_Layer_73.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
    one is nice - half way between a contemporary reimagining of a blackletter and
    a script, I wish I knew what it was; Minas Mljevena coffe:\r\nhttp://www.minas-world.de/Minas-Mljevena.png\r\n\r\nAnd
    a brand of spirits I just thought of, Hungarian Vilmos K\xF6rte palinka:\r\nhttp://www.magyarbeszallitok.hu/images/product/vilmos-mezes-agyas-korte.jpg"
