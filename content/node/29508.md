    the day after the all night partying, when she's got a terrible hangover, massive
    co-ordination problems and is half blind from the booze... :^/"

  body: "Nick, I fear my joke didn't come across properly. :^)\r\n\r\nYou're absolutely
    correct about the similarity with Margo Chase's work, but this logo/typeface is
    of an appalling quality."

  body: "This started out as Herman Ihlenburg's (1882) typeface, Bijou. Fontbank digitized
    it as <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/bangle.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Bangle</a>.
    Then Swfte, one of those companies who put out several \"1500 Fonts for a Pittance\"
    CDs full of ripoff clones, modified it to create the goofy font, Mexacali (yes,
    that spelling is correct).\r\n\r\nI can't find Mexacali anywhere but websites
    full of commercial fonts and ripoffs of same, so I won't link to a copy."

    was garbage, of course, like a gazillion other faces. What a shame.
