body: Hi Guys, <BR> <BR>I found this font last weekend on a second hand fair and I
  fell in love with it. It&#39;s on a very old German stockpaper from 1922. <BR>Does
  anyone know what font this is, and if it is still in use. <BR>Otherwise I see it
  as my job to revive it from the dead. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37936.jpg"

  body: True, it has some characteristics, but it&#39;s not Clearface. Both fonts
    are propably from around the same time. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>
