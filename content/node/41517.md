  body: "logo I designed (with customized K):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mayakaimal.com/index.html\r\n\r\nIt
    is frequently used for books by Indian and other Asian writers (as evidenced in
    the links above), which is frustrating to me because it makes my logo above look
    like a bit of a cliche. I designed that logo when the font was really new, though,
    and not overused for Asian themes like it is now. I remember it also from a book
    I read awhile back about growing up in Afghanistan but I can't remember the title.\r\n\r\nI
    also used it for the title of this book:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.powerhousebooks.com/books!/PleasurePalaces/\r\n\r\nand
    made extensive use of the ornaments inside."
