body: I was wondering if anyone recognized this font?  It was used by Wible Beverages,
  a middle  Pennsylvania Beverage company bought out by one of the big two many years
  ago.  I believe it is probably from the 50&#39;s or 60&#39;s.  I apologize for the
  image being so large.  For some reason, when I tried to make it smaller, the resolution
  decreased. <BR> <BR>Thanks for any help! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/39516.jpg"

  body: The 3D lettering looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/steelplate-gothic-rr/shaded/testdrive.html?s=WIBLE&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Steelplate Gothic Shaded</a>, but a bit heavier.

  body: Marty, do you need the logo, the other face&#42; or both? <BR> <BR>Though
    the weight is wrong, it makes me think of MvB&#39;s <a href="http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/magnesium/pk_magnesium.htm"
    target="_blank"> Magnesium.</a>

  body: Thanks guys.  I think the Steelplate Gothic Shaded is the right call but that
    only has Uppercase as far as I can tell.  Any thoughts on the lowercase for &#34;Drink&#34;?  I&#39;ve
    looked around and can&#39;t seem to find anything with the dot-ended lowercase
    &#34;r&#34;
