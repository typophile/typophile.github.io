  body: "Ciao Nicola (Antonio from studio Bunker speaking): as a companion typeface
    for Gill Sans, I think David\u2019s push for Joanna is rather appropriate. It\u2019s
    a lovely typeface and it\u2019s somewhat underused here in Italy. I\u2019m not
    fond of Perpetua, either.\r\n\r\nYour other requirement that it be available by
    default on Windows machines is a bit of a problem, actually. As serif typefaces
    you have Times New Roman, Garamond, Bookman Old Style and Book Antiqua. All these
    are pretty shoddy renditions of other typefaces and they\u2019re not very good
    as a complement to Gill Sans. You also have Georgia, which is a very good typeface,
    but whose proportions (x-height, ascenders and descenders) make it not a very
    good companion to Gill, either.\r\n\r\nFrom the list linked by David, Hightower
    Text might be good fit, I would run a test print and see how it looks paired with
    Gill Sans. Proportions seem to match, at least, although a Venetian plus a beginning
    of last century sans might be stretching it a bit.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could try
    using <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=CharisSILFont\">Charis
    SIL</a>, which is a free typeface being derived from Charter, designed by Matthew
    Carter for office usage on mid-resolution devices. SIL also offers for free another
    fine typeface called <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium\">Gentium</a>,
    which you might try, but neither of these looks like a perfect fit color and proportions-wise,
    I\u2019m afraid."

    is a serif typeface designed by <a href="http://www.typophile.com/user/1262">John
    Hudson</a> for Microsoft and is included with Windows XP by default. Color-wise,
    Gill Sans is still a bit darker, but using its light weight instead of the regular
    it might provide a somewhat harmonic companion to it. I would give it a shot,
    too.'

    Gill's personality to show a bit more.

  body: To meet the second requirement, another choice may be [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera|Vera
    Serif]], although not the ideal to go with Gill Sans, it's probably better than
    the other Windows OS choices.
