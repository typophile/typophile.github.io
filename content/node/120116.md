  body: "Known as Typo Script, which started out as metal type (p. 402, American Type
    Founders Specimen Book, 1923) and moved into the phototypesetting era:\r\nhttp://library.rit.edu/cary/typo-script-extended-specimen\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to have been digitized for math typesetting, of all things, but by a hobbyist,
    not a foundry (not putting down hobbyists, just making a distinction in case licensing
    or web fonts are needed):\r\nhttp://levien.com/type/myfonts/ofl.html\r\n\r\nNo
    one seems to have revived it commercially. These faces are very similar (essentially
    the same font, just different foundries):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/english-111/

  body: "Thanks Kevin for the ATF Typoscript match.\r\nNote that the alphabet in Levien's
    version has only 23 capital letters and 11 lower case. No numbers.\r\nA complete
    alphabet of the capitals can be found in Ralph Smith's Formal Script, a math symbols
    font for LaTex, at http://www.ctan.org/pkg/rsfs The files are type1, a format
    where you need to put the .pfb and .pfm files in the same folder to view the font.
    Best practice is to repackage it in an .otf wrapper. This is a fairly coarse version,
    based on a smaller point size.\r\nShelly script is indeed a fairly good substitute.
    Most readers would not notice the differences such as the closed loop where the
    upper and lower stokes come together on _B_, _k_ and other letters, rather than
    the open loop in Typo Script as clearly shown in Levin's digitization.\r\nDon"
