    Loud</a> by imagex. Plus <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/segoe-script/\">Segoe
    Script</a>. \r\n\r\nAnd please name your posts more specifically. Don\u2019t use
    \xBBHelp me please\xAB. Appropriate would be in this case: \xBBThank God for my
    husband - font\xAB or else. It\u2019s easier for all of us to find the posts afterwards. "
