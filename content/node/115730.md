body: "Hello Everyone\r\n\r\nI am a second year graphic design student currently working
  on a self - formulated essay question that discusses whether the principle of 'form
  follows function' is the same as 'simplicity', in design, or if the terms have gradually
  started to be incorrectly used in an interchangeable fashion. What are your takes
  on the matter? "

  body: "My own view is not mainstream, but I believe the two are in fact opposed:
    function is so complex that simplicity of form cannot do the job. Or: simplification
    is an escape from function's complexity.\r\n\r\nConcerning the actual <em>use</em>
    of the terms on the ground, I think it's sadly true that people associate simplicity
    with functionality. Part of it is understandable, since complex forms are often
    decorative. But for example if you look at a Formula-1 car, it's not simple at
    all, but it has beauty.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: As I see it, form-follows-function and simplicity have very little to do with
    each other, except you want the simplest form that fulfills the function reliably
    and well. Excess complexity, after all, just means more stuff around to fail at
    the worst time.

  body: "The crux of it is best expressed by the popular paraphrase of Albert Einstein
    by Roger Sessions: \"Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler!\"
    The second part is very important and often overlooked, and properly applying
    it, taking into account all necessary complexities, will often result in something
    that is not very simple at all.\r\n\r\nI doubt I could come up with a more succinct
    summary of biological evolution than \"form follows function\", yet the results
    are, of necessity, staggeringly complex.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, one must remember
    that pure aesthetics often serve a function \u2014 indeed, can <em>be</em> a function.
    The look of something is often useful in ways that are not easily realized or
    expressed."

    It was symbolically functional. It represented function more than resulted from
    function. It looked functional more than worked functionally.\u201D \u2013Robert

  body: "\"Form Follows Function\" is a phrase that originated in the late 1800s and
    was a rejection of  the highly ornamented style that had been popular in architecture
    and in other areas of design. \r\n\r\nObjects designed with this philosophy in
    mind often appear simpler because they lack ornamentation. \r\n\r\nHowever simplicity
    as a design concept goes deeper than lack of ornamentation. It means really thinking
    a problem through and making an object that does the intended purpose well and
    in a simple, easy-to-understand manner.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say I'm designing
    a new tractor for farmers. I could use \"form follows function\" and design a
    tractor that's very functional with no frills, but it might be confusing to operate.
    Or I might design a tractor that's simple to use, but doesn't do the job well.
    Or if I'm really smart, I'll design one that's both functional AND simple to use.\r\n\r\nA
    poster advertising an event could be a simple design but it doesn't communicate
    well. Or it could be very functional but not attractive or easy to read. Ideally
    you want both.\r\n\r\nSo what I'm saying is that they are really different things.\r\n\r\n(And
    some designers have been successful with highly ornamented designs. Different
    strokes for different folks.)"

  body: "The principle of \"form follows function\" is to avoid making form into an
    end in itself. Things should not be simple for the sake of simplicity, nor should
    they be elaborate for the sake of being elaborate. There should be a reason for
    simplicity or complexity, and that reason should be derived from who's going to
    use it, what they're going to use it for, and the circumstances they'll use it
    in. \r\n\r\nIncidentally, this may be the most important difference between design
    and fine art, since in the latter, it is perfectly OK for form to be an end in
    itself."

  body: "Another way of putting it is that fine art is generally concerned with self-expression
    (so form can indeed be an end in itself), but graphic design is generally concerned
    with communicating a message on behalf of a client. \r\n\r\n(Of course there are
    exceptions, like a fine artist doing a commission job, or a designer doing a project
    for themself.)"
