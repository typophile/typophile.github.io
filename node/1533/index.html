		<div class="commentbody"> There it happens again! Another font that I like from a category that I don&#39;t. &#40;Is it me, or this forum?...&#41; Script fonts are usually hopelessly imitative and non-typographic, but this one&#39;s cool. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure what bugs you about the &#34;s&#34; &#40;maybe a little too wide&#41; and the &#34;k&#34; &#40;I think it&#39;s dandy&#41;. The &#34;f&#34; bugs me &#40;the descender shouldn&#39;t do that&#41;, and the &#34;p&#34; looks like it&#39;s running for cover, but otherwise I think you have a winner. <BR> <BR>But what about the caps? Allow me to make a suggestion: don&#39;t try to make the conventional Roman cap structures work; instead, look to the uncial tradition. Hammer might have been too much of a purist, be he was onto something - something that remains largely ignored by most. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Brian, <BR> <BR>I like the spirit of the face in general and the g and m are quite nice. You say the k bothers you, but I don&#39;t mind it. <BR> <BR>It seems like a few of the elements are a bit forced, like the spur on the q and the tail on the p. Also, the loops on the some of the letters seem a little awkward &#40;too exagerated, perhaps and the ovals not highly refined&#41;. <BR> <BR>As an exercise, it would be interesting to see a sample setting of the face, where you could more easily see the relationships between letters outside their order in the alphabet. <BR> <BR>Post it again when you&#39;ve developed it further. <BR> <BR>Cheers. //Joe </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Wow,  <BR>cool script font. It would even look good on a shiny new toaster! <BR> <BR>It seems to be a consensus. The &#39;s&#39; is fine, and I&#39;m in love with the &#39;k&#39;. Please don&#39;t change it. The &#39;p&#39; does look forced, but everything else seems to fit in quite nicely. The tail on the &#39;q&#39; works for me.  <BR> <BR>I wonder if the &#39;f&#39; would perk up if the descender wasn&#39;t as heavy... maybe narrowed just a hair. Or try using the &#39;q&#39;s tail without the flip.  <BR> <BR>The whole face seems like a modern caligraphic form. What if all of the letters w/ascenders and descenders varied ever so slightly from top to bottom?  <BR> <BR>Really nice first face... can&#39;t wait to see more stuff. Can you post a set paragraph? <BR> <BR>HiggledyPig <BR>Eric </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Brian! So glad to see you&#39;re back. It&#39;s looking tasty.  <BR><a href="http://www.virusfonts.com/virus.html" target="_blank">Barnbrook</a> should be pooping his trousers right now. <BR>Let&#39;s get your hands dirty... <BR> <BR><b>1. Balance.</b> I think the upright quality of this design is  <BR>what makes it great. You lost that with the new &#39;d&#39;. But the  <BR>new &#39;p&#39; is better - the original being off-balance. The &#39;g&#39;  <BR>leans a bit too much to the right as well. <BR> <BR><b>2.</b> Good work moving the &#39;t&#39; crossbar to the x-height. <BR> <BR><b>3.</b> I thought Christopher&#39;s ideas on the &#39;y&#39; and &#39;w&#39; were  <BR>good. Maybe just move the left v stroke of the &#39;w&#39; to the left  <BR>a tad. He might be right about the &#39;r&#39; too, but I can&#39;t tell <BR>without a text setting. <BR> <BR><b>4. Caps.</b> Your best uppercasers are the simple ones: &#39;V&#39;, <BR>&#39;w&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, &#39;Q&#39;. Don&#39;t touch those. I think there&#39;s too much going  <BR>on in the &#39;N&#39;, &#39;T&#39;, &#39;F&#39;, &#39;C&#39;. The Tim Burton curl isn&#39;t working  <BR>for me and it belies the smooth, calligraphic nature of the  <BR>face. The ornate &#39;O&#39; might work as an alternate, but the <BR>simple stressed oval is just fine I have no idea what to do <BR>with the &#39;E&#39;. <BR> <BR><b>5. Punct.</b> Pretty.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I personally would like the H better if it were a little wider, or if the bar were lower, or both. It just seems to uptight to me, especially next to the with the P and the R.  <BR> <BR>The T I thought looked great in the word &#34;Tulip&#34;, but on the first page I have trouble recognizing it &#40;and only then by process of elimination&#41;. Perhaps if the horizontal stroke extended a little further to the right? Or perhaps if the vertical stroke curved in the opposite direction it would be more recognizable by evoking the shape of a lowercase t. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here&#39;s the latest, with some numbers and symbols thrown in. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.oogby.com/lj/positronic%20diary%203%20august.swf" target="_blank">http://www.oogby.com/lj/positronic%20diary%203%20august.swf</a> <BR> <BR>Zach -- I completely agree about the &#39;H&#39;, so that&#39;s a bit wider, and while I loved how styilized the &#39;T&#39; was, I see your point about it being difficult to recognize. I&#39;ve moved the horizontal stroke over a bit. Does that help? <BR> <BR>I just noticed that, looking at the B and E, the overshoot on the bottom of the B doesn&#39;t feel at all right. I wonder if it&#39;s just the B, or if I&#39;ve got a larger problem here. <BR> <BR></div>
