    font?)

  body: It's not the same, and it is similarly poorly formed... but <a href="http://www.dafont.com/n-o-movement.font">n.o.
    movement</a> is in a similar style, and is free

  body: "Thanks Jan. It looks similar to FIAT headlines (I\xB4ve checked at FIAT web
    page but there are some diferences) The M: this one has flat top, the middle vertex
    goes to the base and the vertex is pointed (FIAT M has pointed top and vertex
    and this last does not go to base) The E: the central bar is centered (in FIAT
    the central bar is below centre. The D, P, R, G and S are pretty equal to FIAT.
    Any suggestion? Thanks in advanc again."
