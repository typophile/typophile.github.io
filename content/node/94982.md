  you look closely, will see that at 14 and 16pts there seems to be grayscale pixels
  under the /n serifs. How can I remove it, so it looks like the ones at 15, 17 and
  18pts? (Firefox/Mac)\r\n\r\nThe blue lines are already in place, like this:\r\n<img

  the problem remains.\r\nI spend all day experimenting, hinting, un-hinting, tweaking
  blue values, looking at pixels, etc... and wasn't able to find a solution. Nothing
  seems to make any difference.\r\n\r\nThe greyscale pixels below the /o are OK, but
  not the ones below the /n, /i, /l, etc...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    ignored. The only thing I can think of that might help \r\n is hovering your outlines
    slightly -above- the baseline. Even outlines exactly on pixel edges get these
    haloes."

  body: "Two days, a lot of cigarettes and coffee later... finally found a solution!\r\n\r\n@Fore:
    \r\nMac may ignore the hinting, but renders quality can still be controlled!\r\nThe
    fussiness/sharpness of the text, seems to be related to the Vertical Metrics,
    as Mekkablue suggested, and the vertical BBox.\r\n\r\nPlaying around with the
    vertical metrics was the solution! Also, a little bit of blue values tweaking,
    as Mekkablue suggested in the TypeDrawers forum\r\n\r\nThis is how awesome it
    looks now (compare to the image in the first post):\r\n<img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/0U2z3t152F1b3z0r1b30/zoomed%20overshoots.png\">\r\n\r\nIt
    makes all the difference in text sizes. \r\n<img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/3g213L202f1V423W2I03/sampletext.png\">\r\nNow
    it renders as good as the Webtype RE series, or the new H&FJ SmartScreen new fonts.\r\nAnd
    maybe even better at 10px (Keep in mind that I only fixed the vertical metrics,
    there are still room to tweak the horizontal metrics and stem widths)."

  body: Very interesting. What on earth did you do? I assume this is Postscript (bluevalues),
    which will look like crap on Windows.
