  sort out the pictures I save according to category so I can find everything back
  on my computer. Now, I have a bit of trouble with categorizing two of their typefaces:
  [[https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/romain/|Romain]] and [[https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/sangbleu/|Sang
  Blue]], which are both related. I have the feeling it's just the contrast that makes
  me think they're didone-like, while the model is actually transitional.\r\n\r\nThe
  design of both typefaces is obviously inspired by Romain du Roi, which I always
  thought of as a transitional typeface (though exploring the boundaries thereof as
  it clearly takes things further than Baskerville). Gert Wiescher designed a digital
  version called Royal Romain, which on MyFonts is tagged as Bodoni (which I don't
  quite see, but I suppose it could just refer to Giambattista Bodoni's work in general)
  and Didone. On Wiescher's website his Royal Romain is labeled under \"Antiqua fonts\".\r\n\r\nSo
  how would you label these typefaces? I think the flat top serifs give the designs
  a didone atmosphere, but they're less mechanical and lack the teardrop terminals
  usually associated with the didone style. Am I right to consider these typefaces
  to be transitional?\r\n\r\nAlso, where exactly do you draw the line, or is there
  simply no line? I recently stumbled upon [[http://pedroarilla.com/en/valentina|Valentina]],
  which I would consider a didone but it's clearly blurring those lines quite a bit."

  body: "Thanks for the video. That's very interesting. I still don't quite see it
    as just to call Romain du Roi a proper didone though. To me it seems like a bridge
    from transitional to didone. It would almost be deserving of its own style name,
    if only there were more typefaces like it. It's actually quite strange that this
    style was \"developed further\" rather than reproduced like the styles that came
    before it.\r\n\r\nI guess perhaps the style saw a quick development because of
    technological advances; as far as I know Baskerville was also an experiment to
    seek out the limits of design and technology, and after Romain du Roi it was important
    to take it an extra step further, rather than stick with a style that perhaps
    was seen as perfect in its own right. This is pure speculation from my part. Does
    anyone know why it's not a widely seen style?"

    difference do you see in serif style between Romain and Sang Bleu? \r\nTo me the
    it looks exactly the same.\r\n\r\nFor me Didones represent a pointed pen contrast,
    which Romain clearly isn't.\r\n\r\nI think you shouldn't waste time on these classifications
    systems, they are really limited and outdated. They're necessary to give some
    initial understanding to students and beginners, but otherwise, describing typefaces
    by characteristics and other elements such as time of creation, epoch, country,
    mixes of influences\u2026 makes more sense to me \u2013 and is much more interesting
    \u2013 then trying to make them fit into boxes with essentially historical parameters.
    What happens with boxes is you always end up with boxes for \"whatever don't fit
    in those other boxes\".\r\n\r\nAlso, the tags on myfonts don't mean much. Essentially
    it just means the designer hopes somebody searching bodoni will find his font

  body: "<blockquote>I think you shouldn't waste time on these classifications systems,
    they are really limited and outdated.</blockquote>\r\nI agree they are limited,
    but still very useful. Any model is limited but useful. As for classification
    systems being outdated, I have two responses to that. Firstly, I was making a
    consideration of classification about a typeface based on a historical one, so
    at least within this context the type classification system is not outdated. As
    for when it does seem outdated, how about upgrading the type classification system?\r\n\r\nI'm
    very aware of the limitations of classification systems, how some typefaces don't
    fit within certain classifications* and how predominantly new typefaces tend to
    not fit nicely within classes any longer. They're still working very well for
    me though and serves as a basis for all the characteristics and elements you mention.
    A type classification system and the rest you mention are not mutually exclusive.
    A type classification system should probably stand at the base of the rest you
    mention.\r\n\r\n*This doesn't happen as often as you might expect, as I currently
    have over 2500 pictures of typefaces sorted on my computer according to my own
    classification system with only 93 pictures in a miscellaneous folder. That amounts
    to 16 typefaces, and it's not like I didn't know how to classify them, but rather
    the miscellaneous folder includes display typefaces of varying classifications
    which I could have sorted among the other folders but I like to keep them in a
    distinct folder because the designs are distinct.\r\n\r\nThe greater the amount
    of pictures within a category, the larger the need for sub-categories. This is
    how classification systems inherently work. The fact that current type classification
    systems are outdated is because it will be in hindsight that we will achieve the
    insight to classify them. Regarding the serif category the last sub-category I
    use (counting the slab serifs as a distinct model with its own sub-categories
    ) after \"didone\" is \"contemporary\", which at the moment is indeed an arbitrary
    category which fails to define the style in strict terms, but if or when we will
    be working with a new style, all typefaces designed currently which I couldn't
    fit into the historical categories will be redefined. Not using classification
    systems because they're outdated seems silly. You're essentially saying not to
    use any models at all when one model is outdated.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>describing
    typefaces by characteristics and other elements such as time of creation, epoch,
    country, mixes of influences\u2026 makes more sense to me \u2013 and is much more
    interesting</blockquote>\r\nI agree, but it's not an option between all these
    elements and a type classification system. In fact, the classification system
    is based on that and only serves as a model to get more insight. By looking at
    all the other information I can validate aspects of the typeface in regard to
    the model or realize in what ways the typeface deviates from the model and why,
    and this in turn will give a lot more insight into the typeface than \"merely\"
    looking at the time and country it was created in. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>What happens
    with boxes is you always end up with boxes for \"whatever don't fit in those other
    boxes\".</blockquote>\r\nHow is that an argument against it though? Models are
    inherently incomplete or not fully descriptive of reality. That's why they're
    models. When the quantity within a certain (arbitrary) category becomes great
    enough you will achieve new insights regarding how they could be defined and categorized.
    For me the problem is not necessarily how to categorize the miscellaneous designs,
    but how to name these new categories.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Also, the tags on myfonts
    don't mean much. Essentially it just means the designer hopes somebody searching
    bodoni will find his font and like it.</blockquote>\r\nI'm aware they don't necessarily
    mean much because it's generally not professional type designer and researchers
    that are tagging typefaces. The end users mostly tag, and so there are often tags
    being included which say something about the design but are not proper categories,
    and indeed you will sometimes find mistakes or loose associations in the tags
    as well. And yet, all these tags together can be somewhat descriptive of the typeface
    and offer (loosely) associated typefaces as well. I do find it useful to look
    at the tags, but also questioning them. I certainly don't confuse these tags to
    be a historical classification system though. It's not much more than a search
    system which is only partially based on the terms grounded in historical classification
    systems."
