    you just ask to read it.  :-)\r\n\r\nThat said, all of them seem entirely legible
    to me (in context).\r\n\r\nBut: the gaps in \"k\", \"n\" and \"s\" should be bigger

      the gaps, you're right. I had a legibility concern there too. I fear the /k/
      for instance could look like \"I <\" when the  gap gets bigger."

  body: "The single-story seems to gel with the rest of the logo better, as it is
    more open and geometric, but my vote is for the double-story since it will not
    be confused with an o at smaller sizes. The double-story a is a little heavier
    visually than the rest of the lettering, but only slightly. You asked if it looks
    small, but I don't see that at all, so I think you're ok there. For what it's
    worth, the thinner weight of the two looks much better to me, more natural.\r\n\r\nFor
    fun, here's the a both ways:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gtandcanary/morebi-rounded/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/vox/"

    body: "@_Brian\r\n\r\nThanks, exactly what I think about the /a/. I thought it
      could read as /o/.\r\n\r\nAbout the size of double-story /a/, you described
      the problem better, that's what I'm talking about. Single-story blends much
      better with the rest of the letters.\r\n\r\nThose fonts you linked are great
      by the way. I'll study them."
