body: Hello Folks, <BR>I have had fun trying to ID these two fonts today. The client
  said they were Modena and Verona &#40;the word &#34;Australia&#34; is Verona and
  the rest is Modena&#41;. Looks like they are brand new fonts out of the UK. I saw
  a reference on Bowfin Printworks that Mike Yanega had supplied a sample of Modena.
  Hello Mike. A nice lady on MyFonts.com told me that these fonts are both made by
  Miles Newlyn from <a href="http://www.x-and-y.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.x-and-y.co.uk</a>
  &#40;the site is not up yet&#41;. Can anyone confirm that these two fonts are indeed
  Verona and Modena from X-and-Y Co? The main question is this - how can I buy them??
