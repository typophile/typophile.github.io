body: "At first glance, I thought \"Trajan.\" However, I saw it on film and when looking
  at the lettering in a static pic, it was revealed to be something else. It appears
  to be a sort of simple flared serif, but the flare is heavier and begins some distance
  from the tip of the lettering. \r\n\r\nWhat seemed simple to match has not been
  so and now I respectfully request any assistance that can be offered. Thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Equal

    U.S. Supreme Court Building was designed by architect Cass Gilbert around 1930.
    It was still the practice in that era for major architects to create at least
    one original version of the Roman letters on the ancient Trajan column, and to
    include them in major projects. Many of these have not been translated to modern
    digital fonts.\r\nFor a discussion of the Trajan column letters see http://typophile.com/node/28295\r\nFor
    a selection of alternatives to the \"Trajan\" font see http://typecache.com/font-clusters/07/\r\nAs
    for the best fit, take your pick.\r\nThe _J_ seems somewhat out of place. Almost
    as if it was made from _U_ with the lhs trimmed to fit.\r\n\r\nDon"
