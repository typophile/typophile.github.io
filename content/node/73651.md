  most quality responses. I've never really tried to create lettering from scratch
  and this is my first attempt. I've only spent about 45 minutes on it and it is still
  very much a super rough idea. I just wanted to post it and let you guys tear it
  apart. I know it's nothing special but I would like to see what the community has
  to say.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vivital_5124.jpg]"

  body: "Are you trying to make a new typeface or just a logo? Have you defined the
    idea behind this?\r\nAnyway, VIV should be spaced evenly since both letters are
    mirrored; I would make the top of the i as tall as the V, while the bottom (the
    vertex) needs to be optically adjusted ([[http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics&id2=&id3=&id4=&id5=&idpic=01#pictloader|have
    a look here]]), same for the A's bowl.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that I'm not an expert,
    I would wait for other people's comments to show up"

    type of comments I wanted to hear. I knew there were details I had overlooked.
    Thanks a lot.
