body: I seem to have gotten myself into a bind on a popular Mac forum. <BR> <BR>I
  posted the &#34;Chalkboard vs Comic Sans&#34; argument. The consensus was that Chalkboard
  is better than Comic Sans. However, I proposed that Apple could have bundled a better
  handwriting font that would do the same job as Comic Sans/Chalkboard. <BR> <BR>What
  would such a font be?
