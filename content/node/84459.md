  Centi font is based on Swedish black-letter tradition (rather different then, say,
  German black-letter tradition), but also inspired by modern day Roman linears, I've
  consciously borrowed elements from Akzidenz-Grotesk, Univers, URW Gothic Light (a
  free (as in freedom) Avant Garde substitute, that is actually (in my opinion) much
  more useful then the original) and Microgramma (my font actually started as \"Centigramma\"
  and was intended to be a better Microgramma with lower case letters, but I got some
  new bright (hopefully) ideas after drawing half of the upper case letters and two
  of the lower case letters, and decided to do something more original).\r\n\r\nThe
  font is constructed primarily for use with Swedish and secondarily for use with
  Norse (Bokm\xE5l, Nynorsk) and Danish.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/Centi-Font-Specimen
  v.0.23a.pdf\">Font Specimen</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/Centi-Light-0.23a.pdf\">Glyph
  list</a>\r\n\r\nThe font is planned to be released under the GPL version 3 license,
  with a font embedding exception (advice on choice of web communities where I can
  put it up to be downloaded, or for development collaboration, is appreciated). \r\n\r\nBe
  aware that the font is still in alpha-version, but hopefully a beta will be available
  soon.\r\n\r\nGive me good advice and criticism. Don't forget to mention if there
  is something you really like, that will make it more likely that I will keep that
  feature in future versions.\r\n\r\nI have already noticed that something is wrong
  with J \xD0 \xDE 2 and 3, they just don't fit in, but I don't know what to do about
  it.\r\n\r\nAnother annoyance is that g set in a small sizes, get a \"blob\" in the
  middle on low resolution/quality devices (a.k.a. LCD screens). I have no idea how
  to fix this. Is it possible, in an OpenType CFF font,  to switch to another letter
  form at a certain resolution threshold? All the other glyphs work with small sizes
  on low resolution devices, so I feel that bitmapping is overkill.\r\n\r\nI would
  also like to make p and q, n and u, and possibly i and j, more legible for people
  with dyslexia caused by rotating and mirroring. n and u are almost identical in
  shape (but I did draw them separately) and I'm unsure if the differences is large
  enough for p and q, and i and j. It would possibly improve readability to people
  without dyslexia as well.\r\n\r\nThere are some problem with line widths ever since
  I converted the font to a larger em-unit. Since fixing this require a large overhaul,
  I will try to discover all rounding errors before I correct this problem.\r\n\r\n(I
  hope my Norwegian and Danish spelling is correct in the picture, I have never seen
  the words in writing and I have no Danes or Norwegians at hand to consult.)\r\n\r\nSince
  I'm an ethnic Geat/Goth living in Geatland/Gothia, this is one of few modern typefaces
  that can be claimed to be a true Gothic typeface ;-)"

  body: "<blockquote>When you refer to the \u201CSwedish black-letter\u201D tradition,
    are you talking about Dalakunst?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNot at all. In periods, I
    spend a lot of time reading old Swedish books in blackletter. Blackletter was
    dominating the Swedish printing scene until the 1730's, it was still used to print
    religious literature and some books for the lower class, as late as the end of
    the 19th century. (Latin languages, like Latin and French was of course printed
    in Roman letters, even when used within the same books.)\r\n\r\nSweden have most
    of its book publishing-history, been dependent on foreign printers (if I remember
    correct, most Swedish language literature (in the very popular genre of \"r\xF6varrromaner\",
    \ I don't know what that genre is called in English) was printed in Oslo during
    some period in the late 18th century ;-), mainly Dutch, Deutsch, Baltic and, somewhat
    later, English and French printshops. At the beginning the Swedish customers (mostly
    the government) simply accepted whatever the printer gave them, so the style varied
    by where the printshop was situated, or in the case of an ambulating printers
    that was recruited to do the job inside Sweden, by the nationality of the printer.
    This would change with the publications of Johannes Bureus, a Swedish scholar,
    that constructed some really unique typefaces for his publications. One of his
    styles (a Kurrent Fraktur) become an instant hit in 1611-15 (he had the Royal
    patent on printing ABC-books for kids), and if his original types wasn't available
    at the printshop, then some other typeface that looked similar was used, a very
    distinctive Swedish blackletter tradition was born.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://litteraturbanken.se/#!forfattare/BureusJ/titlar/RvnaAbcBoken/sida/2/faksimil\">One
    edition of his ABC book</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.kb.se/F1700/ABC.htm\">Another
    edition of his ABC book</a> (warning, user-unfriendly flash application, but Typophiles
    are used to that aren't they?).\r\n\r\nThe man who broke the blackletter tradition
    was no other then Carl Linnaeus. As he used a lot of Latin and foreign loan words
    in his scientific publications, he thought it would be silly to have pages with
    just a few blackletter words tucked in, in odd places, and he decided to print
    everything, even the Swedish parts, in Roman letter. He also published some books
    that became best-sellers, not only within the scientific community but within
    the general Swedish population, and the rest is as you say history. Once printers
    and publishers realised they could use the cheaper, more space conserving (= using
    less paper and ink) Roman types, in books intended for ordinary people, they immediately
    followed in his footsteps. Most Swedish printshops (at that time Sweden was mostly
    independent when it came to printing, even if the general quality level was rather
    poor (fading ink)) already had some Roman founts, because most books published
    used some Latin language loan words.\r\n\r\nIt is kind of a shame though, because
    Swedish-style blackletter is actually easier and faster to read then Roman letters,
    the characters and word-shapes is more unique and easier to scan.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>For
    screen use at small and medium sizes you\u2019ll need some Truetype hinting. You
    might also need some outline adjustments to busy spots like the middle of g. I
    certainly wouldn\u2019t buy in to the dyslexia font myths without some serious
    research. Those waters are murky. If you only want to play with the g, perhaps
    a simpler g by default is a good idea? There is a titling feature in Opentype
    you can advice the end user to turn on for headlines.</blockquote>\r\nI don't
    want to depend on the irregularities of TrueType hints. I sometimes cut and past
    from a Type 1 font directly into PostScript-code when I write my documents, using
    a simple text-editor, or generate PS-code with simple scripts, and then send it
    directly to a PostScript-printer. I was planning of using the titling feature
    for, well, titles, not for switching from screen to print quality.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Vet
    ikke helt hvordan man skulle oversatt det til norsk, men kanskje \u201Cjordb\xE6rkrembursdagskake\u201D.
    Man ville aldri skrevet noe slikt i ett ord uansett.</blockquote>\r\nI've always
    heard that Norwegian have an easier grammar, as well as is easier to spell then
    Swedish. If a simple composite-word like \"jordgubbsf\xF6delsedagst\xE5rta\" is
    hard to get right, then that must be untrue (just teasing, I don't even know if
    Norwegian is your native language).\r\n\r\nOn a more serious matter, do you think
    the font can be made to work with Norwegian, I don't read that much in Norwegian,
    so I honestly don't know what I'm doing, or why I thought it would be a good idea
    to try to support Norwegian with all its pesky diacritics. Also, feel free to
    suggest another word in Swedish/Norse/Danish, that covers \xC5\xC4\xD6\xC6\xD8,
    if the Danes also use \"creme\" for \"gr\xE4dde\", and \"bursdag\" for \"f\xF6delsedag\",
    then I have lost my last \xD8 (but we all know, that however they spell it, it
    will sound exactly like the same guttural sound they use for every word ;-)."

    but you have to ask yourself if you really add anything valuable here. There are
    many fonts that support the Scandinavian languages, although few care about more
    rare stuff like for example the Saami language. Your \xE6 and \xE5 are poorly
    shaped IMO, and I'm no Iceland or Old Norse reader but that thorn might be a stretch.
    Why did you include the ij diagraph?\r\n\r\nThis design is in my opinion not very
    refined. I think the execution is poor, both technically and visually. I'm also
    not sure if your base idea is strong enough: Some single letters looks promising
    (I love that eszett!), but the rest is not coherent enough."

  body: "In response to frode frank:\r\n\r\nThe design is not very refined because
    it took 5 days to create, it is an early alpha version. I put it up for review,
    because I know that I have easy to get carried away by ideas that in hindsight
    wasn't that bright. If some idea is really bad, I prefer that someone stop me,
    before I waste years on trying to implement it. I also hope that it will become
    a good typeface for reading (especially in sizes 3-8pt). That it will be pretty
    to look at is also a goal, but high readability is priority number one. The most
    important thing is that it doesn't look so ugly and/or weird that people never
    start reading (hopefully, no-one will ever think of it as a blackletter font,
    unless someone point it out). Also, I didn't use a refined typesetter to produce
    the samples (I used OpenOffice.org, a word-processor that produce as ugly typography
    as MS Word, if not worse), because I wanted to expose any weaknesses of the font,
    it looks much more \"refined\", set with TeX or a DTP application.\r\n\r\nThere
    are many fonts that (in a very broad sense of the word) support Scandinavian languages,
    but I have never seen a digital typeface that fit the Swedish language well, not
    even one. All Swedish language publications made since the 1990's look like total
    crap to me, and they are unnecessary hard to read. This is of course a matter
    of personal taste and what kind of letters you are used to read.\r\n\r\nThe thorn
    isn't Icelandic, it is Swedish, that's why it looks \"wrong\". I've also dabbled
    with a Geatish style eth (a small bowl with a long steam that go straight up and
    is crossed by a very prominent stroke), but it looked to weird outside handwriting/carving.
    There were still a few old people living who used runes for scribbling and as
    craftmans marks when I was a kid. I have no intention of supporting Icelandic,
    as I wouldn't know how; in all my life I have read less then 20 books in modern
    Icelandic and even though I occasionally visit news-sites, blogs and other Icelandic
    language sites, you can't really absorb the typographic tradition of a region
    on the web, all web-sites use English style typography, it is a consequence of
    the limitations built into the web-browsers and available digital fonts. Anyway,
    you saw that it was a thorn, for the occasional need of thorns in Swedish, Danish
    and Norse typography, that might be sufficient, the important thing is that it
    fits with the text in those languages and that it isn't hard to distinguish from
    p d o or b for someone with reading problems.\r\n\r\nIJ is simply fun to make.
    I don't know if it looks even remotely Dutch, but there are enough IJ-ligatures
    in Swedish blackletter for me to play with.\r\n\r\nThe \xDF was done in, literally,
    seconds. It is just long-s an z put together, I haven't put any thought into it
    (the glyph is based on my first designs of long-s and z, that's why the long s
    in the font doesn't look like that in \xDF). Funny that you would like it.\r\n\r\nI'm
    very interested in why you think \xE5 and \xE6 is bad. The ring on \xE5 \u013Aooks
    like it does because originally the O was open at the bottom and it kind of stuck.
    An open ring also make it less likely that the ring and the A will look like they
    cling together in small sizes, a pet peevee of mine. I also used the same ring
    in % to make it easier to identify as a ligature, if I ever implement an ring-diacritic,
    I will use a closed ring. The \xE6 is outside my area of expertise, so I'm not
    really surprised if someone using it natively doesn't like it, to be told about
    stuff like that is why I put the font up for criticism."
