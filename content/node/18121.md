body: I gotta grouse here for a minute. I do this for fun, not for glory, but the
  ID credits have been so slow - and sporadic - lately that by the time they are posted
  the threads have dropped to the second or third page, making them really only useful
  to the original poster. They used to be updated daily. I realize it's probably time
  consuming and not so much fun, but still...

    insaely busy he is, so I didn't really worry about it.

    is Yves' party. Other moderators are afraid of Yves and so we let him have his
    only play area. :^P

    through the cracks to keep them returning to the front page.

  body: I also believe...as long as we help get the ID solved then we've done our
    job. Granted it doesn't help when people search or are perusing the Type ID board
    but the original task at hand is completed. :-)

  body: "One benefit to the IDers is that we don't spend time reading threads that
    are already answered. It would be great if there was a way for us to set a flag
    for Yves (or whoever has Closeout authority) that says we <em>think</em> we have
    solved the question. Then those threads can be checked more quickly to get concurrence
    and closure by the moderator.\r\n\r\nWould that be possible?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "To further clarify my suggestion -- the 'flag' I was talking about should
    be something that shows up in the Type ID Board list of threads, so that we can
    all see which threads are probably already answered, even if they don't have the
    official 'X' and braces on them.\r\n\r\nThat would help us, and the posters, and
    harried Yves.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    the site I want to look only at the unsolved IDs or to find out what the experts
    have ID'd and when there are pages and pages of threads with out the {x} it's
    hard to know.\r\n\r\nAnd it doesn't help that so many threads are titled \"Help
    ID this font!\" which I KNOW is not Yves's fault!"

  body: "A few options to weed out solved IDs would help.\r\nA good way would be to
    have 3 tabs up the top to open up seperate sub pages which could be:\r\n1) Unanswered
    posts\r\n2) Pending posts (replied to but not officially solved) and\r\n3) Solved
    posts.\r\nThis way people could look in a more focused and uncluttered way.\r\nAnd
    in each seperate sub page/section you could have a few options for each like:\r\n1)
    omit posts older than X-days.\r\n2) omit \"cold\" posts after x-days of inactivity.\r\n3)
    Flag \"Hot\" topics to appear at the top of the list.. \r\nETC ECT\r\n"

  body: "OK, it's 01:45 am now, and I had to drive all the way back to work to print
    the remainder of the 192 page book I designed the past two weeks, as they need
    to be proof-read by my colleague first thing this morning. While the prints are
    rolling out of the machine, I'll tell you guys a little story.\r\n\r\nOnce upon
    a time, I was a 'regular' visitor of Typophile. Managed to pull off a couple of
    successful ID's, built up a little rep, got friendly with a number of people.
    In those days, the Stewfmeister literally owned this place.\r\n\r\nAt some point,
    the tagging, (x)-ing and renaming of successful identifications was introduced.
    It was a vast improvement for the reasons we all know, but Stephen once explained
    me how much work it was. He had to open <em>every single thread,</em> check if
    it was identified and by whom, double-check both sample and result to assess if
    the identification was correct, then go to the Admin side and tag and rename the
    thread. All went well until I noticed that -- as traffic started to exponentially
    grow -- Stephen appeared to have trouble keeping up. I <em>did</em> know he was
    a busy guy, being co-owner of Typographica and actively involved in a couple of
    other type websites, but it still came to a point where I started to get annoyed
    by the lateness of the tagging.\r\n\r\nDid I start a thread on the forum to whine
    about it? Nope, I sent an offline e-mail to Stephen, offering to help him with
    the maintenance of the Type ID Board. And now it's me who's head honcho of this
    place.\r\n\r\nI realise this might sound like I'm ticked off, but don't worry,
    I'm not. That's why I first cleaned some of the backlog before replying. I just
    wanted to put some stuff into context.\r\n\r\nThe prints are all done, so I'll
    continue with some 'splainin' of the current situation tomorrow. Then, after that,
    I'll peek into my crystal ball and tell you what might be in store for this area
    once Typophile finally gets out of Beta.\r\n\r\nBear with me, it'll be worth it."

  body: "Oh, before I sign off a little clarification:\r\n\r\nIt says on the Forums
    page that the Type Identification Board is sponsored by FontShop, and there occasionally
    is some advertising on the site, plus there are quite a few paying members.\r\n\r\nDon't
    be mistaken -- I don't see <em>any</em> of this money, not one cent. I wouldn't
    want to neither, but the fact still remains that I invest real actual time into
    this place, and quite a substantial amount even, for free. I used to participate
    in General Discussions, and I used to pull off double the ID's I do now. Not anymore,
    as I don't have any time left besides my family, my work, my independent graphic
    design activity, my rock band, and my three (soon four) writing assignments.\r\n\r\nPlease
    don't think I'm playing the victim here -- I like doing this, because it allows
    me to give to the community, to provide a real and valuable service. I'm not complaining,
    but maybe a reminder of the proper context was in order.\r\n\r\nAs I said before
    -- more later."

    Patricia's original question:\r\n\r\nWhenever my daytime job starts spilling over
    into my downtime -- which is never really 'down', but what's in a name -- my voluntary
    work is the first thing to be sidetracked. I've been racing against the clock
    to design this book, so that's why I couldn't keep up with the maintenance of
    the Board lately. Today I sacrificed my lunch break to clean at least the current
    page, and I'll see what more I can do this weekend.\r\n\r\nAs long as the new
    functionality of typophile isn't implemented, this will be a recurring situation.
    It has always been like that in the past, it will be like that in the foreseeable
    future.\r\n\r\nI will take into consideration any and all applications for assistance
    and pass it on to J'n'J, but please keep in mind I'm just the cleaning lady here
    -- it's not up to me to decide whose profile can be upgraded and granted moderator
    access."

    more than just 'catching' up, with me. I love Typophile, I really like and respect

    I wouldnt want to be a Typophile moderator, as I not even had / have the time
