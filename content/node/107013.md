  Satisfaction [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/satisfaction-pro/]] - I like
  the overall energy,  but I am put off by the overall quality which seems quite sloppy.
  \r\n\r\nAny suggestions? \r\n\r\nTia.\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Hi Sebastian,\r\nProbably a bit on the self promo side here, but I just released
    a script last week that might serve that purpose. The weights are similar and
    it also has a very low x-height like Satisfaction. Satisfaction is probably a
    bit more retro looking since it stems from old mid 20th century cigarette ad lettering.
    Mine is not from a historical source, I just do a lot of lettering. Might be worth
    looking at for you.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/baghadeer/\r\nStephen"
