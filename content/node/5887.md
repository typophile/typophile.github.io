  across another typeface with similar features. Only now I can&#39;t remember what
  it was. <BR>It was in the vein of Melior, Renault, Century, and was suitable for
  text setting. <BR>Any suggestions greatly appreciated

    <BR>Dunno, could be anything, almost. What else do you remember? <BR>What was
    the &#34;a&#34; like? Maybe hypnosis would trigger some recollection.  ;-&#41;

    you have seen one of these? '

  body: I remember the curved characters &#40;top of the a, the c, s, etc&#41; had
    squared terminals, much like Verona. Thanks William for Edison, I was not aware
    of it, though it&#39;s not the face that I had in mind, but a valuable resource
    for this style.
