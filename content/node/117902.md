  body: 'Because of /E and /F middle crossbar terminal shape, [[http://www.dafont.com/big-top.font|Big
    Top]] removing external median thorns should do the job perfectly. But be careful
    with this one as it is almost identical to aforementioned Buckhorn (perfect suggestion
    Kevin :). '

  body: "This is an archetypal Tuscan style produced by various Victorian foundries,
    sometimes with with relatively minor variations.\r\nI know the quality of Michael
    Hagemann's version [Buckhorn based on an old font called Broadside] is first class.
    If your examination of Big Top shows that it is of good enough quality for your
    purposes, you can follow Ryuk's suggestion. If you feel Big Top is not quite as
    high a quality as you would like, I suggest you follow Kevin's suggestion of Buckhorn
    and edit as required.\r\nDon"
