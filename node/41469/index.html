  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have an ink jet printed envelope dated March 2006. 
There are 28 characters. 25 agree with the above mentioned types but the troublesome characters are the comma [,] the zero [0] and possibly the seven [7]. 
-The form of the comma disagrees completely. 
-The zero is elevated above the baseline on the envelope and
-The seven appears to extend slightly below the baseline.

The agreeing characters are:
AabCdehikLlMnorStuvWwy.14

Any ideas what this typestyle is? 
Or...what could cause these variations if there is not a different agreeing typestyle?

Thanks!

Thanks for the suggestion but Nicolas Cochin doesn't agree with the rest of the characters...are both Nicolas Cochin and Koch/Eva Antiqua available in the same computer program?

>no problem to do it with Illustrator, InDesign, Quark etc etc. you said March 2006, right?

Yes, March 2006. Due to case confidentiality I can't go into details but it is not likely that the Type was altered in just those minor areas. However, if it is a 'homemade' Type then it would make it individualizable which could identify a person/computer!!

The rest of the document is consistent with Koch Antiqua and Eva Antiqua.
A few more character samples:

		<div class="commentbody">Bitstream had a version of Koch they named Kuenstler 165 Roman which is also known as your already mentioned Koch Antiqua. The letter d seems to match up - as well as the numbers. The only "off" I can see from your copied sample (I'm assuming this was on a piece of paper scanned in which is why the gray background and the thickness to the letters) would be the comma. Though the comma looks a bit out of place -- as it seems to appear heavier that then letter/numbers sampled. Maybe it's just me, and the fact that I should be asleep.

However, I have seen that comma before... now if only I could remember where...

BTW - you may want to check out the lower case letter O o for your "zero."</div>

>why not. 

I'm trying to find out whether they are commonly available on a program that would be preloaded on a computer or mainstream off-the-shelf program? Or would the person have to go through effort to add them to his/her computer? (I have Microsoft Word 2000 on a three yr old computer which doesn't have either types.) As of now, the case is a 'fishing' expedition...trying to piece together as many variables as possible to narrow down the possible assailant(s).


> If you have the necessary knowledge and means (e.g. as an antique book dealer)— fabrication isn’t “a big deal”

I appreciate the fresh perspective. It's hard to look outside the box when you've been digging around in it for so long!



>BTW - you may want to check out the lower case letter O o for your “zero.”

Thanks for the suggestion. However, neither the zero nor the O are elevated.



I appreciate everyone's advice! This is a great resource that I'm sure I'll use again.

Could it be, the guy who digitalized the font (one of the guys) decided to make the Apostroph a Comma? (May be he thought to be wiser Rudolf Koch was?).

However, I don’t think any of them is a direct match – i.e. without manipulation.

The comma looks a lot like a lowered apostrophe/single right quotation mark. If the originator messed with the figures, why not with the comma?

Great find!! It's interesting to note that the versions available on MyFonts.com have verticle, straight-line apostrophes.

No, that’s a popular fallacy … a typographically correct apostrophe is not the straight thingy you can access (more) easily via your keyboard, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Typographic_form">Wikipedia on the apostrophe</a>.</div>
