body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI am putting a small guide together for non-designer types to
  explain the different categories of typefaces.\r\n\r\nAs you know this categorisation
  can go on and on, but I want to keep it as concise as possible without being incorrect.\r\n\r\nSo
  far I have:\r\n\r\nSERIF\r\n- Old Style\r\n- Transitional\r\n- Modern\r\n- Slab\r\n\r\nSANS
  SERIF\r\n- Grotesque\r\n- Neo-grotesque\r\n- Humanistic\r\n- Geometric\r\n\r\nSCRIPT\r\n-
  Formal\r\n- Casual\r\n\r\nNow this is where it gets tricky - do I list Blackletter,
  Mono Spaced, Decorative, Symbol etc. separately or try and classify them all under
  one category: Display. \r\n\r\nOverall  -  Is there a better way of doing this classification?\r\n\r\nAny
  help on this would be much appreciated\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nS\r\n\r\n"

    Style (Garamond)\r\nTransitional (Baskerville)\r\nModern (Didot)\r\nSlab Serif
    (Clarendon)\r\n\r\nAnd amongst the Old Style group, you've got \r\nItalian Old
    Style (Manuce)\r\nFrench Old Style (Garamont/Granjon)\r\nBelgium Old Style (Plantin/Van
    Den Keere)\r\nGerman Old Style (Sabon)\r\nDutch Old Style (Van Dijck/Kis)\r\nEnglish
    Old Style (Caslon)\r\n\r\nAnd amongst Blackletter, you've got a wide range of
    styles: Old French, Old English, Textura, Rotunda, Bastarda, Schwabacher, Fraktur,
    Granjon's Civilit\xE9s, and others. Enough said."

    computer-typewriter, OCR.\r\nDecorative is a vague notion that integrates many
    styles and artistical movements.\r\nSymbol is synonym for pictogram.\r\nWhen it
    comes to Blackletter, it fits the calligraphy category and this calligraphy category
    integrates the scripts: French (XVII th century) and English (XVII and XVIII th
    century) scripts that you call formal scripts. Casual script is identical to graphic
    type."

    nothing particularly 'Germanic' going on here?

  body: While this is a worthy endeavor, it may end in frustration if the target audience
    is non-designer types. In my experience, you can show laypeople the difference
    between serif, sans-serif, and script, but if you try to break it down any finer
    than that, they glaze over as I do when a birder wants to explain to me about
    the fifteen kinds of finches in the Galapagos Islands.

  body: "Or you can go the Bringhurst route and refer to typefaces by the reigning
    visual art movement under which they were designed, which I have to say makes
    a whole lot more sense to me than random made-up terms like \"oldstyle.\" True,
    the Bringhurst way doesn't tell you whether a postmodern face, say, is a serif
    or sans, but once you've established the general category into which a face falls
    (serif, sans, script, blackletter \u2026) the art-movement method seems to be
    the clearest way of further specifying a style."

  body: "I think Victor and Joshua's comments are the most useful criteria for a font
    classification \"for non-designer types.\" To see a fairly good model take a look
    at how Dafont classifies its fonts by themes. http://www.dafont.com/themes.php
    This is truly \"font classification for dummies\" and works quite well at matching
    people with the kind of font they are seeking. If this is too detailed, just lump
    some groups together.\r\nDon"

    really works. Shure one can link some obvious classes of display typefaces to
    them, but not all of them. Also, the \u2018art movement method\u2019 denies the
    fact that both art and typefaces design recycle the works from their own movements.
    And they do not do it the same way and in the same period. Also, art movements
    and typeface design are both international, but their paths through history are
    not always the same. Just as it is difficult for laymen to be able to tell the
    difference between impressionism and expressionism it will be difficult to explain
    to them why FF Meta can be considered to be a post-modern sans. I read Bringhurst
    with great pleasure but I think his approach to typeface classification is rather
    romantic. People look at forms without knowing where they come from or what they
    may be good for, typeface designers create forms. The most direct way to connect
    these two should be visual. All other means are nice to have extras. They may
    be good for various reasons, but when they play the first role, they are rather
    obfuscating than making things clearer. I consider the Vox terminology is one
    of the best examples of a terminology which obfuscates things to the non-expert
    user."
