  lead me to the following schools:\r\n\r\n\r\nRMCAD, Denver, CO\r\nhttp://www.rmcad.edu/\r\n\r\nUniversity
  of North Texas, Denton, TX\r\nhttp://www.art.unt.edu/course-listings.html\r\n\r\nIf
  there are any alumni from either school on Typophile, I'd like to know what you
  think about the curriculum, difficulty, etc...\r\n\r\nI'd also like to know what
  other people think of the schools whether they've attended or not. \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "I am. I know that RISD, New York, California, and Georgia have ideal schools
    but they are more expensive than what I can afford. My boyfriend and I are also
    planning on getting married in about a year so we're trying to gravitate toward
    places where he has a network of job leads and I have a good school to go to.
    \r\n\r\nThus we've started narrowing things down to the Dallas area, Colorado,
    and possibly North Carolina. "
