  body: ' Very fine font set! I like it, especially the LC characters m, n, s, &amp;
    g.  <BR>The UC Q looks strange but still legible. Perhaps the D and the upper
    part of the B looks too square, but it&#39;s rare to see bitmap fonts with a real
    style like this one. <BR>Good luck distributing it! <BR> <BR>Greg. '

    but its a minor gripe. <BR> <BR>Overall, the most stylish 8 pt font I have ever
    seen. <BR> <BR>Matthew '

  body: ' Hi Miguel. I have looked at this face with amazement since its post, so
    here is my critique. There is nothing that I can see that needs to change. I could
    sugggest a set of lining numerals to be added to an alternate version and perhaps
    the lc w is a bit wide, I can however not suggest a better way of doing it so
    leaving it might be best. The lc &#39;g&#34; is really nice, as well as the old
    style numerals. I would buy this. Ole '

  body: ' As usual very nicely done. <BR> <BR>At the risk of stating the obvious,
    you&#39;re <BR>deliberately using the limitations of the <BR>medium &#40;straight
    lines, 45 degree diagonals&#41;  <BR>to improve the design. &#40;Especially referring
    to <BR>the curves of the m, n, s, w, g, and even the b  <BR>and q.&#41; <BR> <BR>Bravo. '

    attention: <BR> <BR>- lc &#34;s&#34; &#40;For me he seems strange. The <BR>terminals
    are too short. In the minimental <BR>his is good! <BR> <BR>- lc &#34;t&#34; &#40;The
    Cross Stroke is short. I think one <BR>pixel more. <BR> <BR>- up &#34;J&#34; &#40;too

    Detroit 45 might be published as well?

  body: I&#39;m blown away by how legible this is. and yet it&#39;s very characteristic
    as well. you seem to have a true grasp on pixels - how they infer letterforms,
    from the ground up. well done. <BR> <BR>the only thing that I&#39;m so sure of
    are the ligatures - even though they certainly are a nice touch. <BR> <BR>I want
    to see the italic version!  I would buy this &#40;assuming I have $$$ that month&#41;
