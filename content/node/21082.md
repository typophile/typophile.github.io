  under development here: http://typophile.com/node/21014  I need feedback/ideas please
  and possible typeface suggestions for a sans. Do I even need ''Design'' as part

  body: "Having looked at your proposed website I wonder if you need to have a logo
    at all. Having said that you have started one so I'll ask what the x actually
    means, I prefer the second of the three you posted on your thread about the content
    of your website although the x seems a bit laboured as though it hasn't come from
    the same hand. On the first impression of the logo on its own, I think people
    will read graffiti-style graphics which might/or not be suitable or complementary
    to your work, which kind of takes me back to my first point. Of those that you
    have posted here I like middle row lefthand though it does look a bit like a signoff
    on a note to a girlfriend, I would definitely avoid the swooshes they look like
    a mark on a test paper.\r\nI hope I'm not being too negative here, but I would
    re-consider the need for a logo.\r\nTim"

  body: "I guess the fact that I'm struggling with it, maybe does mean that I don't
    even need any sort of 'mark' at the top. You're not being too negative...this
    is just basically a way to preview some of my better work online, I'm not starting
    up my own design company or anything.\r\n\r\nThe _x_ just originated from a concept
    I had a long time ago about a signature line and a hand drawn script I had of
    my name ie. sign here  X___________________"

  body: "Ahh, I see the concept now but I'm afraid it is lost without the explanation.
    I wouldn't write it off for future development but I would keep the site as simple
    as you already have it in the visuals and let the work do the talking.\r\nTim"

  body: Fair enough. I always have problems developing websites, interactivity kind
    of boggles my mind. I think I may just go super minimal. Look for updates on the
    other page!
