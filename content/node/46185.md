  I would rather get [[http://www.vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights/|National]]
  instead of Stag sans. On the type tester, it seems like they would work well together,
  but I would love your opinions.\r\n\r\nIs Stag/National a go or a no?\r\n\r\nSharon\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: In my opinion it's a no, because it seems to look too similar to Stag slab
    with the rounded curves. I would prefer Stag sans, the forms sounds perfect together
    and it seems to look a bit cooler, more rational. National is more emotional.

    are right.
