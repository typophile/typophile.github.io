body: "Hey Felllow Typophiles,\r\nI'm looking for more information / options for these
  decorative style typefaces. I've found a typeface called \"Futura Custom\" which
  is ok, but I'm trying to find well done / professional within this style. I've seen
  it pop up a few places and reminds of Rennie Mackintosh / or even a touch of geometric
  bauhas a bit but not quite. Does anyone have any suggestions / history on this style?"
