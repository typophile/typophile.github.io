    would try something \"cut and then curved\" (http://typophile.com/node/41687)
    to reference Bank Gothic's construction.\r\nPeri\xF3dico (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/periodico/)
    too has nice cuts, but I'm not sure they could harmonise with Bank Gothic's."

  body: "Ok, interesting suggestions... I'll look into the cut'n'curved faces.\r\n\r\nYes,
    the font used in the logo is established, therefore unchangeable (also not my
    design!). The secondary face will be use for print literature from now on. Obviously
    I'm giving more consideration to the fonts used than the original designer!"

    used to great effect.\r\nUnfortunately it has been overused to death not least
    by every sci-fi movie and TV-show for decades now."

  body: "Far from being timeless, Bank Gothic is a late 19th/early 20th century style,
    revived in 1930 for its proto-modernist af\uFB01nities, I would imagine.\r\nIf
    it were truly, reductively modernist, it would not have the chamfered or angled
    terminals which are its most distinctive feature, and the D would not chicken
    out of being a true match for O and C (note that Trump\u2019s City holds the line
    in that respect). \r\nAnother giveaway to its 19th century origins: the short
    central bar on E.\r\n\r\nIts name refers to how this square style was used in
    bank signage, often in brass. Here is an example (photo from 1905)\u2014on the
    scaffolding, not above the door.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/central-savings-bank_6340.jpg]\r\nAnd
    another:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PaducahTxFirstStateBank1910DateStone1208BG_6270.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlthough
    a sign style, it was probably more popular engraved. As Mark Van Bronkhorst notes
    re. his <a href=\"http://www.mvbfonts.com/sweet_square/\">Sweet Square</a>:\r\n<blockquote>The
    engraver\u2019s square gothic has been one of the more widely used stationer\u2019s
    lettering styles since about 1900, made popular long ago by bankers and others
    seeking a serious, established feel to their stationery. </blockquote>\r\nHere
    is another square style from the turn of the century:\r\nhttp://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/hamiltonnailhead.php"

    but still going strong.\r\nThat\u2019s what I meant by \u201Ctimeless\u201D, not
    that it hasn\u2019t a specific and recognisable  point of origin in time, but
    that, despite it, it has proved useful in a variety of situations far removed
    in time and intent from such origin.\r\nAnd I suspect one of the reasons is also
    because it isn\u2019t \u201Ctruly, reductively modernist\u201D, but have distinctive
    features.\r\n\r\nAll that said, nowadays I wouldn\u2019t use it (and that holds
    true for Trajan too), if not for a parody piece."

    the Bank Gothic. And the S in both -- they're not related at all of course, but
