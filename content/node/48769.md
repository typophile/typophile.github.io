    in it.  I like it in general. It's hard to tell, but it might be a bit too regular
    & consistent across glyphs -- almost formulaic. Varying some of them a bit might
    be in order. \r\n\r\n-matt"

  body: "Ned, Ned, Ned...Constructionally speaking, this is absolutely outrageous
    and makes no sense at all. So I have to ask the question, why do I have such a
    broad grin on my face every time I look at this bad boy? There are some crazy
    curves in it that I would never have chosen in a million years. That said, you're
    most definitely on the edge of something very, very cool. Maybe I want clearer
    rules to be established across the font, for example the R has an ink trap on
    its counter that the B doesn't have. Why? And yet, it's a thing of beauty and
    very different. Is it pure self-indulgence on your part or do you have a 'use'
    for it (other than bringing a smile to people's faces, of course)?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "hah, nick..\r\n\r\nIt's the first font I've really ever spent much time building.
    So what your seeing is a series of mistakes, luck, an appreciation for history
    + the midwest, with a touch of bare-bones (typography 101 represent) intuition
    from a 23 year old kid out of college.\r\n\r\nYeah, i see what your saying with
    the ink trap. I really wanted to build this font to have a certain small town
    charm, extra character if you will, but still work as a system. It does have hic-ups,
    things that come from no where (i.e. the A).. but aesthetically speaking I feel
    like it mostly holds together (the X has been troublesome).\r\n\r\nHow would you
    suggest I proceed from here? Really want to make this thing mint."

  body: "Some minor points: The crossbar on the small-cap a seems too wide. The top
    of the small-cap b seems too thick, and I agree with Nick that both Bs need ink
    traps like the P and R. I'd like to see punctuation. You might experiment with
    making a few of the glyphs wider, like the N, R, X and K -- right now it's almost
    monospace with wide M and W. \r\n\r\nI particularly like the flair on the top
    of the B, the diagonal crossbar of the A and H, the ink traps, and the punched-out
    detail in the lower right. In general I think this is great and nearly ready for
    prime-time. \r\n\r\n-matt"

    like a Q.

  body: Fantastic work.  Minor thing, but I feel like the 3 is a little off.  Where
    all the angles meet on the left seems ot be a bit jarring...makes it look like
    it's hunched over almost.  Still awesome though...if you were selling this somewhere
    I'd buy it.
