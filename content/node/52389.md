  is the title of Clannad, a Japanese anime currently being aired on Tokyo Broadcasting
  System. \r\n\r\nBesides the good story, I'm sort of interested in the strange fonts
  in the tittle, especially A in display,relatively small uppercase R because I've
  never seen A letterform like that. I wonder if the font is another customization.
  How do you think?\r\n"
