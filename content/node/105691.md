  character, but still very legible.\r\nI've always loved Bodoni Poster Italic, but
  it is of course quite heavy in many occasions. \r\n\r\nI would like a monoline font,
  preferably in various weights.  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\nMads"

    Egyptian\xAE</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/sensibility/light-italic/\">Sensibility</a>\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/archer/styles/\">Archer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/ideal-sans/styles/\">Ideal

    that the sort of thing you meant?"
