    have seen very different behavior and different options. I used the interpolate
    and MM options in FOG to great effect; they have saved me a ton of work. \r\n\r\nI've
    asked Ted and Yuri about the strangely-worded option \"Do not interpolate compatible
    outlines\", because not only does it do something different than it implies, it's
    the opposite of what I want: I <em>want</em> to interpolate the compatible outlines
    (which FOG does), and those that aren't compatible, shouldn't interpolate (which
    also works in FOG). \r\n\r\nBasically there are a lot of bugs in the way FL handles
    this and I'm hoping they get them cleared up. Meanwhile if you really need reliable
    interpolation, go back to FOG....."

  body: This is behaviour which is still in FLStudio5Mac, and which has been reported
    to Yuri Yarmola and Alex Petrov at FontLab by Peter Bil'ak, James Montalbano,
    and myself. The latest Beta still shows this problem, but there is hope in my
    heart that this issue will be addressed. Perhaps the program can check target
    glyphs for BCPs, and if none are present any BCPs created duting a Blend are retracted...

  body: The Blend function does add extra points, but  I have been making MM databases
    in FL for years using Mask-to-Master and as long as my glyphs are compatible (and
    I instruct FL never to add points), FL never does add any points. It is a bit
    more work than using Blend, but the results are excellent.

    compatible means there isn't anything left for the software to do but mathematically
    average the data between the two masters. No added points, no \"corrections\",
    no detecting and fixing. I think of interpolation as a very simple operation.
    FL seems to be making it more complicated than it needs to be. \r\n\r\nFont Chameleon
    was the tool to use when blending two completely unrelated sets of outlines (like
    Garamond and Futura). But we are designing various weights like Light and Bold
    from the ground up to be compatible. Sometimes we make one master from the outlines
    of another master, ensuring compatibility from the beginning. I want FL to correctly
    blend compatible outlines (per definition above), OR, give a message that the
    two outlines are not compatible and refuse to blend. Nothing in between helps
    me, because it requires manual cleanup to correct the bad resulting shapes. "
