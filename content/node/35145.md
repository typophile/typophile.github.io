  to buy a copy of Fortune on line.  \r\n\r\nI've always assumed, naively perhaps,
  that all the fonts in my dog-eared Letraset product manual would be easy to find
  on this here interweb.\r\n\r\nAlas, i've fallen in love with Fortune, which is the
  display face they set the original printings of the Dick Bruna books in, and i can't
  seem to find it anywhere.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nBest!\r\n\r\nSimon"

    might find that <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/volta/\">URW Volta</a>
    comes close enough to satisfy your nostalgia cravings.\r\n\r\nBTW, I fondly remember
    those books from when I was little. I think those formative typographic experiences
    stay with you - I know, for example, that the soft spot I have in my heart for
    Souvenir is due to the fact that my beloved Ranger Rick magazine came every month
    with all the main text set in it.\r\n"

  body: I second Raph's Volta suggestion. It was the closest digital match I could
    find to Bruna's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/sets/72157600081519286/">"Cinderella"</a>.

  body: "Thank you both, Raph and Stephen.\r\n\r\nVolta is a very good match!\r\n\r\nRaph,
    I couldn't agree more with you about \"formative typographic experiences\".  I
    think my personal Espana Wide revival of the early late 80s was linked directly
    to the consumption of MAD Magazines.  \r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\nSimon"
