body: " a recent job solicitation on multiple forums triggered a little debate about
  forum cross-over, and it occurred to me (as a relative newbie) that the forum guidelines
  are pretty lax...  i'm ok with that, as i enjoy browsing, but i do notice type ID
  queries in just about every forum as well as lots of design critiques and software
  questions outside of their appropriate categories. it seems that many folks simply
  default to \"general discussions\" for their posts.\r\n\r\ntwo questions : \r\n\r\ndo
  we collectively care enough to try and reinforce the categories ?\r\n\r\nand :\r\n\r\nwhat
  is the general policy toward job / project offers ? \r\n( i don't see many here,
  and i don't come to typophile to find them - just wondering).\r\n\r\nalso : thanks
  in advance and perpetuity to moderators for their sisyphean efforts.\r\n\r\n"

    You can politely tell people they would have better luck in the appropriate forums.
    The moderators are paying attention and we'll move the threads as we notice them.\r\n\r\nMost
    jobs that have nothing to do with type or typography are considered spam. These
    threads are removed. If, however, someone is posting saying they need a type designer
    and it is a humble enough request there is no reason not to leave it. Most of
    us can tell the difference. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There is simply no way to ensure posting will happen in the appropriate areas,
    not with the number of visitors Typophile sees, but as Tif said, part of what
    the moderators do is to move threads into other topic areas if necessary and keep
    everything tidy.\r\n\r\nThough we'd love to have the boards organized as efficiently
    as possible, there are no set rules that say software discussions must be kept
    within the Build section, or logo discussions under the umbrella of Critique.
    In coming months, we will be making some minor tweaks here and there, and part
    of that will hopefully assist users, especially newbies and first time visitors,
    in finding and posting to the appropriate sections. Type ID is certainly an area
    that needs this attention, and much of the issue is simply exposure. A significantly
    large % of visitors do not land on the \"Forum Topics\" page so they may not be
    aware that the option exists until after they have posted."

  body: "Type ID has far and away the most threads, but General Discussions has the
    most posts, obviously because a lot of ID's are taken care of pretty quickly whereas
    some of the General Discussions threads go on and on.\r\n\r\nDo you have a way
    to track which forum gets the most hits?\r\n\r\nFor myself, I wish that Critique
    was limited to font critiques as the subtitle suggests. I have always felt that
    the sub-forum \"Typography/Composition\" kind of gets buried there. I forget to
    look. I'd rather see that under Design."

  body: This is really a problem. We generally need to get away from name-calling
    altogether. If someone is new then we need to extend more "benefit of the doubt"
    their way. If someone isn't new and you don't enjoy their posts you should ignore
    them. No one is making you read anyone's comments and/or threads.

  body: "And by generally I mean, of course, altogether. Name-calling is for school
    yards and this isn't a school yard. And even there it isn't appropriate. \r\n\r\nWe
    all need to try to read between the lines a little more or ask more questions
    to discover what is in between the lines. Assuming only causes problems. If you
    have a sincere question as to why someone posts something then ask the question.
    Don't make an assumption and post based on that. We, Typophile as a collective,
    can benefit from each other only if we allow for the collective to exist. Name-calling
    is one way to destroy that collective. It is human to disagree with someone's
    POV, but it is inhumane to debase that person only because you disagree and further
    not allow that person to have their own POV. \r\n\r\nWhen you participate in online
    discussions you agree to use common courtesy\u2014which is common sense to do
    so. We've lost a few people because this doesn't always happen. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There is a revealing story about giving the benefit of the doubt in the Talmud.
    The sages said \"Be judging every person in a favorable light.\" So the question
    is: What does that mean? So the story goes that a certain famous sage was seen
    going into a house of prostitution with a sack of money, staying for a half hour,
    and later emerging with a young woman, and without the money sack. \"How do you
    judge that in a favorable light?\" a sage asks his student.  The student answers:
    this was a time of war, and his sister had been captured and sold into prostitution;
    he went to pay a ransom to rescue her before anything bad could happen to her.
    --And that was indeed the case, the story concludes. \r\n\r\nThings are not always
    what they seem, and our anger is easily aroused, at least if you are anything
    like me. I try to remember that story and smile--which also helps. "

    \r\n\r\nYes, I'm aware that the students who post without doing research are a
    thorn in some sides. For those of you who find the thorn the best thing to do
    in regards to that is ignore the thread. Or, even better, make a simple suggestion
    that gives them a little help but also suggest that the best place to start is
    the library or wikipedia. Do all of this with a smile too. If you can't then simply
    ignore the thread."

    certainly don't mind helping students, altho it sometimes does cross the line
    into doing their homework for them. Particularly when they ask what they should
    write their dissertation on.\r\n\r\nIt certainly benefits students more if they
    are given suggestions as to how to conduct their own research rather than just
    answers. Give a student a fish, he'll eat for a day; teach him how to fish he'll
