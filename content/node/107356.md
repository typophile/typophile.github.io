  discussions. I thought I'd dive right in: I'm a graphic designer and just starting
  out with calligraphy and lettering. I've finished my first project and I'd appreciate
  some feedback on it. On any angle, really. I have no one here to critique my work
  and there seem to be some real pros here, so I hope I can learn a lot from you guys
  :)\r\n\r\nHere's my project:\r\n[[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Much-Madness-is-Divinest-Sense/12102353]]\r\n\r\nAll
  the best,\r\nNatascha"
