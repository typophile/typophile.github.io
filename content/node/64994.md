body: "HI,\r\n\r\nI read a few threads on scaling a whole font but there were no definite
  conclusions or majority view.\r\n\r\nI have a hand drawn and scanned typeface that
  I have traced in Illustrator. The alphabet was drawn out many times with the artist
  circling the characters he favoured for the font with some alternates.\r\n\r\nSo
  I traced them and then measured and scaled using this method:\r\n\r\nIn Illustrator:\r\n\r\nAscender=
  14.565mm\r\nCap Height= 12.22mm\r\nX-Height= 3.9mm\r\nBase= 0\r\nDescender= 7.864mm\r\nWhich
  makes my em square 22.429mm or 63.578pts\r\n\r\nSo I convert to 1000 UPM by:\r\nAscender=
  14.565 / 22.429 x 1000 = 649.38\r\nCap Height= 12.22 / 22.429 x 1000 = 554.83\r\nX-Height=
  3.9 / 22.429 x 1000 = 178.34\r\nBase= 0\r\nDescender= 7.864 / 22.429 x 1000 = 350.62\r\n\r\nSo
  to scale my illustrator drawings to pop into FontLab (presuming I have UPM set to
  1000) I need to scale each glyph up by (1000 / 63.578 x 100) = 1572.871118%\r\n\r\nWhen
  I scale this way, set my FontLab file up with the values for Ascender etc, the glyphs
  come in bang on where they are supposed to.......\r\n\r\nBut when outputting the
  font, it is tiny. I mean, really, really small.  So I read up on scaling it up.
  There are two viewpoints, it seems, on doing this. Either altering the UPM or Tools-Actions-Contour-Scale
  (with apply to whole font with both hints and metrics ticked. Altering the UPM means
  I only alter one number. Scaling requires me to recalculate and reposition the guides,
  which admittedly, doesn't take long.\r\n\r\nBoth methods seem to work but when I
  go to Exort the .otf FontLab warns me that the UPM is not 1000 and this could lead
  to problems. What is the safest way to do this and why is it safer or better?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n"

    the letters scale them up in Illustrator. It will probably be faster than fixing
    the problems caused by Fontlab rounding errors and then you don\u2019t have to
    worry about software not liking a font with an oddball UPM."

  body: "I would recommend using ScanFont to import Illustrator outlines into FontLab.\r\n\r\nShort
    of that, follow Mr Puckett's advice and scale them up in Illustrator first.\r\n\r\nIn
    Illustrator, one point equals one FontLab unit, so scale your illustator outlines
    to something approaching 700 points on the Cap height and you will be on your
    way."
