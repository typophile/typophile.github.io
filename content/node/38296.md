  would like to have a few new ASCII symbol punches/dies made for my Graphotype (made
  by Adressograph-Multigraph) debossing machine and would like to have close matches
  for the style and size.\r\n\r\nThe machines were used to make addressing labels
  (remember the little white gummed paper subscription labels on magazines) in the
  earlier 1900's and USA military DogTags from 1940 until recently.\r\n\r\nThe font
  would have been made to match up with some contemporary typewriter fonts and some
  available hot metal font as well.\r\n\r\nIt is a monospaced font 11 character per
  inch in this example\r\nThe Courier New sample was at 48 Point to match size.\r\nThe
  strokes are all single width as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on a font I
  could use as a giude.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nKalle\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monospace-scan_5638.gif]"
