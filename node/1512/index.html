		<div class="commentbody">I agree. There are too many &#39;typed out&#39; logos. I think <BR>there are a lot of designers out there who are too afraid of <BR>type design to try. I know a bunch who couldn&#39;t render a <BR>letter to save their lives. &#40;Oh no, my beziers are lumpy!&#41;. <BR>Given, I am still trying to perfect this art, but I think there <BR>should be a little more emphasis on drawing type in design <BR>schools. I don&#39;t think people realize how powerfully unique <BR>letter forms establish identity. <BR> <BR>I always smile when people ask what font I used for a logo <BR>and I can say, &#39;No font, it&#39;s custom&#39;. Sometimes even <BR>clients are impressed. If nothing else, it makes you feel <BR>macho in a nerdy designer kind of way. <BR> <BR>The worst are logos done in script fonts that are supposed <BR>to look handwritten. It&#39;s even worse when they repeat <BR>characters without using alternates or ligatures. I have a <BR>hard time justifying &#39;hand-written&#39; fonts anyway, let alone <BR>in a logo. If you want to look like calligraphy, hire a <BR>calligrapher, or learn to draw yourself. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s true that it&#39;s easier to make deadlines and budgets <BR>with fonts, though. And we&#39;ve all been there...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It&#39;s true that it&#39;s a time thing, too, and sometimes <BR>an existing typeface is the perfect solution. <BR> <BR>With the Typophile <BR>T-shirt designs, I was encouraged to see Custom Type <BR>and Lettering, or reworkings of existing type. <BR> <BR>speaking of Custom...Dylan, way to go man! <BR>Your site is up and looking fine.

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;ve been teaching a digital lettering course, and my students who all said they were &#34;very comfortable&#34; in Adobe Illustrator at the begininng of the course, are realizing that rendering original work with bezier tools is a lot different than what they are use to doing in AI.  <BR> <BR>bj states that every designer should know how to do this, and I agree, but not every design student has been taught how, so I wonder how many designers know how to handle a bezier.</div>
