  body: "thnx for replying everyone!\r\n\r\nReasson i'm looking for an alternative
    is because the client asked for it, the previous font they used was Foundry Monoline,
    they want a font that looked kind of like it but they wanted a complete new identity
    including the typeface...i tried to convince them in just staying with Foundry
    Monoline since they wanted something that looked or had the same feel but the
    answer i got was \"we like to have something more up-to-date\".....myself i preferred
    for them to use Foundry Monoline but i didn't really wanted to get into this big
    argument that would make them say \"let us think about it for a while and we'll
    get back to you\" and risk losing the job.."

  body: "Yes, that's my consideration. I like DIN a lot as a typeface, but I'm getting
    really tired of seeing it. For some reason it's the default art academy typeface,
    where 80% of the students will use it for their presentations. That can't be good.
    I personally feel it doesn't speak of being a good designer if you consistently
    use the same typeface. For every new project different considerations should be
    made regarding the choice of typeface and so it's more than just unlikely that
    DIN will be the ideal typeface every time. A design philosophy like Massimo Vignelli's
    I consider to be very bad.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, DIN is beautiful and can offer
    nice branding possibilities, but considering its overuse I would recommend looking
    further if possible. You want your brand to look unique/original after all."

  body: "Personally, I think how you're using the typeface is a lot more important
    than the typeface itself. Using a grotesk that gets less exposure is still using
    a grotesk, and unless there's something really funky about it your brand isn't
    going to look unique or original. There are a few cases where a custom typeface
    has really helped shape a brand's voice \u2014 like GE Inspira, for example \u2014
    but most of the time an out-of-the-box typeface isn't going to do that for you,
    and someone could just as easily come along a few months later, use the same typeface,
    and dilute your brand.\r\n\r\nBrooklyn Academy of Music uses News Gothic, arguably
    the most boring typeface out there, but it does interesting things with it which
    makes the brand distinctive. Would they have been better served using, I don't
    know, Founders Grotesk or something? I don't think so.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying typefaces
    don't matter \u2013 they really do \u2014 I'm saying the vast majority of the
    time a typeface isn't capable of doing the heavy lifting for you."

    important than the typeface itself.</blockquote>\r\nThat might be, but I feel
    this is a different issue. Why not first select a functional, beautiful and original
    typeface and THEN see how best to use it? It doesn't matter if you use Helvetica
    in the best way possible, I will still be annoyed with its choice.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Using
    a grotesk that gets less exposure is still using a grotesk, and unless there's
    something really funky about it your brand isn't going to look unique or original.</blockquote>\r\nProbably
    not, but using a highly prolific typeface is probably going to add insult to injury.
    Reading your statement one could almost draw the conclusion that it doesn't really
    matter whether you use Arial or Nimbus Sans. I submit that it does matter \u2014
    a lot.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There are a few cases where a custom typeface has really
    helped shape a brand's voice</blockquote>\r\nThe impact it has may be very subtle,
    but even the subtle effects should be considered. Let's say there is a brand which
    uses a typeface which is neutral to everyone and has no impact one way or the
    other but our small type community is very annoyed with some of the details in
    that typeface. Wouldn't it then be a better practice to choose a typeface which
    is at least neutral to everyone? Even if it impacts few people, I think it still
    matters. Whether making such small extra impact is cost-effective should obviously
    be considered as well, but that's a different matter.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Would
    they have been better served using, I don't know, Founders Grotesk or something?
    I don't think so.</blockquote>\r\nI have my doubts but I wouldn't completely dismiss
    the possibility either. To be clear though, I don't necessarily want every brand
    to use an \"exciting\" typeface. I agree it's vital how a typeface is used, and
    often a \"boring\" typeface can equally impress, sometimes more so.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I'm
    not saying typefaces don't matter \u2013 they really do \u2014 I'm saying the
    vast majority of the time a typeface isn't capable of doing the heavy lifting
    for you.</blockquote>\r\nI tend to agree with that, but to dismiss the subtle
    impact a certain typeface will have is taking things too far.\r\n\r\nTo get back
    to the DIN consideration, I still think that if everyone is using DIN, it's wise
    to look for alternatives. Why would you only differentiate in the use of the typeface
    if you can also differentiate with the choice of the typeface? It doesn't have
    to be vastly different, but caring immensely about the details and subtleties
    is what deserves respect and what will strengthen the brand. Using Helvetica in
    the best way possible doesn't have that effect on me. In fact, almost by definition
    when I see Helvetica being used, I feel the company/designer is either ignorant
    or doesn't care enough about the details and subtleties and what they want to
    represent."
