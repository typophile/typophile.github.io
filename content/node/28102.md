  - Present Std - in their website design, as it is used in the slogan section of
  their logo.\r\n\r\nTheir actual logo was created by another (unknown) designer,
  and in the interest of consistency across mediums (media?) I'd like to retain as
  many elements as possible. The main body has been created out of Trogman's Handel
  Gothic (albeit with adjusted proportions), with the slogan created out of Present
  Std by Sallwey (similarly adjusted).\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest to them to retain
  the Handel typeface for their logo, but perhaps refine the face used for their slogan.
  I don't feel it (Present Std) is appropriate for their business (selling cars),
  or for the web. I also don't feel that the two typefaces are particularly complementary.\r\n\r\nSo,
  my question is: \r\n\r\n1) does anyone know of any well known examples of logos
  or identities (or other) that use Present Std so I can review the typeface in practice,
  (or direct me to a resource that can help) and;\r\n\r\n2) do you have any suggestions
  for an alternative, but not too dissimilar font, in order that we don't disrupt
  their current branding, given that they have previously invested heavily in print
  advertisements and signage with these two typefaces in the logo?\r\n\r\nThanking
  you in advance!\r\n\r\nRiss\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PAC_Logo_4744.jpg]\r\n\r\nAbove:

    agree that Present seems out of place here. Will see if I can think of alternatives."
