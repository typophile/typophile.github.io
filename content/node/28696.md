  hebrew script and egyptian heiroglyphs and arabic all wrote from right to left?
  was there a particular reason? there must be. who changed this habit and why and
  when (which century)?why do we write english left to right? how did all this change
  come about? chinese write from right to left too. where do they come into all this?
  i'd like to know if anyone has any answers. thanks.\r\nPS how is French, Spanish,
  German etc written? what other languages still write right to left? i know Urdu
  (Pakistan) is still written right to left."

    and greek alphabets are written from left to right. (This actually covers american
    and european continents as well as a significative amount of the african continent
    and oceania, also some places in asia).\r\n\r\nI can't tell the reason for this
    but it makes sense if you write using your right hand because this way you don't
    cover the las written words with your hand and you are not touching fresh ink.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    ORIGIN early 17th cent.: from Greek, literally \u2018as an ox turns in plowing,\u2019

    \u2018ox(plow)turning\u2019 used to be the norm for Greek for a fairly long time.
    Me thinks that the advent of more democratic writing materials (like ink and pen)
    made going left to right handier (most of mankind being righthanded) AND of course
    a lot easier to read (if I\u2019m not mistaken the \u2018returnline\u2019 was

  body: "I don't know if anyone really answered the question posed regarding text
    direction, so here is what I learned:\r\n\r\nA long time ago, before pen and paper,
    people \"wrote\" using a hammer and a chisel (or spike). Just as now, most people
    then were right handed, they had to hammer using their dominant hand, holding
    the chisel or spike with the left hand. In this way, it is easier to etch or carve
    words, symbols, and hierogplyphs from the right to the left. \r\n\r\nThis right
    to left approach was almost universal; even the Latins and Greeks started at the
    right (this was a VERY long time ago). When pens and papyrus/vellum came along,
    the Greeks innovated by going in both directions within the same text; that is,
    they started from the right, got to the end of a line and then started going back
    toward the right, and then back again in a zig-zag. The Latins felt this was just
    too much and they settled on the left to right method. \r\n\r\nIn Asia, paper
    has been around for a very long time, as has ink; what came first, however, were
    turtle shells and bones upon which the ancient Chinese carved their earliest pictographs/ideograms.
    The nature of these materials (being thin) caused the writer to start carving
    at the top of the bone or shell and go to the bottom (this is a natural progression
    because of the height/width of Chinese characters). \r\n\r\nWhen the Chinese invented
    paper, they continued the practice of top to bottom writing; but why they started
    at the right of the page is beyond me. I suspect it was easier for them when using
    a bamboo brush and an inkstone. Other Asian nations, such as Japan and Korea,
    adopted Chinese characters long before they created their syllabaries, which is
    why they, too, wrote from top to bottom, right to left (though these practices
    are dying).\r\n\r\nI hope this explanation helps..."
