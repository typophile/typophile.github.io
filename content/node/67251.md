body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nSome time ago I remember reading in a thread about a multiple
  layer font, with various styles that could be combined (stacked) in various combinations.
  It was quite experimental, but looked really nice. My problem: I forgot the name
  and I don't know where to begin to look... Does anyone know what typeface I'm talking
  about? Please give me a name, and if possible a link.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"
