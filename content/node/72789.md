  body: "no, and don't you find it a little tiresome when a good design choice is
    dismissed as \"aesthetic.\" by folks who think that what they do in life has more
    serious & practical applications that what you do. \r\n\r\nThere is no \"VS' between
    aesthetics and legibility, Unless by  \"aesthetics,\" you mean something that
    is clearly meant to be decorative That is a different matter. IF a font is meant
    to be decorative, then legibility isn't is main purpose in life. \r\n\r\nYou can't
    think of the aspects that go into making a font  legible without aesthetics, but
    while aesthetic choices may be beautiful they also have to be appropriate to the
    job at hand.\r\n\r\nAesthetics have a real function \u2014 You could call it ergonomics,
    or something along those lines. You can't have a legible / readable font that
    is also ugly, because \"ugly\" is distracting, and a legible font shouldn't be
    intruding into the consciousness of the reader in the act of reading.\r\n"
