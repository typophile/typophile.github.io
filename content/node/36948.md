  and I'm pretty much committed to writing them in LaTeX. Some of my work requires
  technical notation, for example. I'm also tired of the fonts that come with LaTeX
  or are easily installed off CTAN. I'm wondering how I might expand the repertoire
  of fonts I can use. I'd appreciate any suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBernhard."

    to academic journals etc.? Don't forget that in the latter case, the publisher
    will throw away your font choices and use their in-house fonts anyway...\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "Installing fonts in (La)TeX has always been a pain, for which you can get
    some relief at the TeXhax mailing list (texhax@tug.org).  Recently, X\u0258TeX
    (mailing list at xetex@tug.org) has made it possible to use OpenType fonts in
    (La)TeX.  Also, if you don\u2019t mind learning a new \u03A4\u03B5\u03C7-based
    system, there\u2019s ConTeXt that also has some support in that direction.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2110\u2134\u212F\u2113"

  body: "XeTeX is definitely the easiest route to using more typefaces, but beware
    that not every typeface has all the math support that you might need. See for
    example, <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-1/hartke/\">Stephen Hartke's
    article in the PracTeX Journal</a> on math fonts.\r\n\r\nFor regular (PDF)LaTeX,
    see the excellent <a href=\"ftp://tug.ctan.org/pub/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide/fontinstallationguide.pdf\">Font
    Installation Guide</a> by Philip Lehmann. Also, there are several articles about
    font installation in the PracTeX Journal."

  body: "In addition to the Font Installation Guide, the LCDF typetools are a very
    easy way to install OpenType fonts into LaTeX.  There is an automatic mode that
    is almost automatic. I think there's one configuration--the updating updmap if
    I remember correctly--that's not automatic.  These comments are based on my experience
    running LaTeX under Linux.  I haven't tried doing this on Windows.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    OK, I hate to be one of those Linux-using, command-line loving people who throw
    the word \"easy\" around indiscriminantly.  After looking up the scripts I wrote
    to install fonts with otftotfm, I'd say the correct phrase is \"easier than it
    used to be.\"  And it's writing of the .fd files for use with LaTeX that's not
    automatic.  There appears to be a script called [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/otfinst/|otfinst]]
    that automates even more of the process.\r\n\r\nScott Thatcher"
