  on many racecars which leads me to believe it is a font.\r\n\r\nI have noticed throughout
  my search that some people modify the font by either cutting the top serifs? off
  or making the bottom rounded.\r\n\r\nSorry that is about all the info I have. Thank
  you for your ahead of time for your hard work and effort.\r\n\r\n-Justin\r\n\r\n<a

  body: Sorry, I don't know this one... But reminds me [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/clarendon/|Clarendon]]...
    Starting with for instance [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/clarendon/urw-clarendon-t-extra-bold-extra-wide/|Clarendon
    Extra Wide Extra Bold]] and tweaking it (slanting, adding a spur on the bottom
    left, adding a shadow and an outline stroke), it would be not so far...

  body: "The top of the '1' is oddly squared off. As I replied to your e-mail, this
    may not be from a font, but may be from a set of numerals designed for racing
    car decals. My feeling is that you may do best by just approximating this look
    starting with a very heavy weight serif and then tweaking it to resemble this
    numbering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
