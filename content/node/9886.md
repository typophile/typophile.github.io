  body: 'Uh-oh: the Windows program that I am using is extremely finicky about fonts:
    it only accepts TrueType. I Googled Hardrino and noticed that vendors only sell
    this in a PostScript version. Anyone know of a foundry that offers this font as
    a Windows TrueType?'

  body: You could try getting a font conversion utility to create TrueType from PS
    Type 1, or you could download Adobe Type Manager Lite for free. I don&#39;t understand
    why Windows users think they can only use TrueType, or is this just a problem
    with your application program?

  body: No, it&#39;s just a problem with a particular program that doesn&#39;t recognize
    PostScript fonts. I&#39;m on Windows XP SP2, so there&#39;s no need for ATM, except
    for MM support, which I don&#39;t use. <BR> <BR>The program is NeroVision Express
    &#40;used for creating DVDs&#41;. I have many PostScript fonts installed on the
    system, but none of them are accessible by Nero. Tech support confirms this.

  body: Well then, I think the font conversion utility would be worth looking into.
    I think there are some free tools for the job, or <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/Font-tools/TransType/"
    target="_blank">FontLab&#39;s TransType</a> would certainly handle it.

  body: Thanks, Mike, I&#39;ll look in to that. <BR> <BR>As an alternative, can anyone
    recommend a font similar to Hadriano? I looked at some of Goudy&#39;s other fonts,
    but I couldn&#39;t find a good match in terms of weight. The only thing close
    is Goudy Heavyface, which may be too heavy, unfortunately.
