    with a single storey /a such as [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]]
    ([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura|BT version]] has a wider /B)
    simply reworking vertical stems terminals.\r\nFot what it's worth, if I have to
    reproduce, I'd probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avenir|Avenira]]
    recreating single storey /a from /q bowl, reworking terminals then slanting the
    whole thing."
