body: "Please share your thoughts on the pairing of the following as a serif (text
  type) and sans serif (display and caption type) combination for a small book of
  photo-graphic/typographic images:\r\n1  Sirba and Soliel\r\n2 Sirba and Myriad Pro\r\n\r\nMy
  initial interest is in the complementary relationship of Sirba and Myriad Pro in
  terms of ascender height, x-height, character width, friendliness and readability.
  However, Soliel \"feels\" like a hybrid of Myriad Pro and Avenir that may be a bit
  more complementary.\r\n\r\nI appreciate any feedback based on your experiences with
  these typefaces.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJudy\r\n\r\nPS: Attached sample is Myriad
  Pro and Avenir for Display and Constantia for Text to come as close as possible
  to the intended type pairing ... until I purchase Sirba and/or Soliel. "

    an ubiquitous workhorse like myriad.
