body: "Hello:\r\n\r\nI've developed an app called Typism for type enthusiasts, on
  the Android platform.  Typism could be of use to artists, designers, or anyone who
  loves type.\r\n \r\nHere's the Android Market URL, where you can download it and
  look at screenshots: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.augmentedmind.fontwhatever\r\n\r\nI'd
  be grateful for suggestions about what might be needed or just be cool to have,
  and feedback about what I have so far implemented.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the user can:
  \r\n\t\u25AA\tdisplay samples of all font files on the device ending in .ttf or
  .otf, with the exception of fonts located inside other application bundles.  This
  does include the system fonts.\r\n\t\u25AA\tdisplay the contents of the font file's
  \"name\" table (see http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm or https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6name.html).
  This contains copyright, licensing, designer, manufacturer, and other information.\r\n\t\u25AA\tgrow
  or shrink the sample text and apply bold, italic and underline styles to it. \r\n
  \       \u25AA\tfont display is multi-touch aware; i.e., you can pinch-zoom to change
  font size \r\n\t\u25AA\tchoose text and background colors including alpha, either
  with sliders (seekbars) or through direct entry of hex color values\r\n\t\u25AA\tdownload
  font files of interest into a local collection. A custom, integrated browser eliminates
  the need to use a file manager.  Zip archives are handled transparently and effortlessly.
  A bookmark list is implemented and pre-loaded with a few font sites I know of.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/device-2012-05-16-204811_4757.png]"
