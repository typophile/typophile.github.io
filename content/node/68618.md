body: "I keep changing things within the kerning and whenever I generate a font, it
  asks me if I want to rebuild the kern feature.\r\n\r\nSometimes, I get the dialog
  box when generating the OTF font file at the end of the exporting process... and
  that's when it freezes the program. the only safe way I can rebuild it is to rebuild
  it within the opentype window and then generate the font.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid i'm
  damaging the font?\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated"

  body: "In FontLab, when you create kerning pairs in the Metrics window, it only
    updates the kern table, not the kern feature. In order to bring the kern feature
    up to date with the kern table, you have to rebuild the kern feature. You can
    do this in the Kerning Assistance window. If you haven't done this, FontLab will
    remind you and give you the option to do it when you generate an OT font.\r\n\r\nNormally,
    if you're doing all your kerning within FontLab using the Metrics window, there's
    no harm in doing it when you generate an OT font.\r\n\r\nI don't know what's causing
    the freeze, but it's probably not related to rebuilding the kern feature. "

  body: BTW, the only time it's bad to rebuild the kern feature is if you've edited
    the kern feature code directly in the OT Panel or have generated it outside of
    FontLab (using something like Metrics Machine, for instance). Rebuilding the kern
    feature will wipe out whatever you've done, replacing it with whatever happens
    to be in the kern table.

  body: FL (5) always freezes on me if I <em>haven't</em> rebuilt the kern feature
    before compiling. You can rebuild as many times as you like.
