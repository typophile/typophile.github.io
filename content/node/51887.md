  body: "Art Deco is an all the history books, but at the time it was a marginal part
    of typography, as was Modernism.\r\nIf you look at any mass circulation magazine
    of the era, there may be one ad out of hundreds that has a \"modern\" or art deco
    style. The rest are historicist.\r\nThe same thing is true of typefaces.\r\nMost
    of the types designed during the 1920s were historicist.\r\nThe seminal sans serif
    types Gill, Futura, and Kabel were published at the end of the decade, and became
    established in the 1930s.\r\nBut if you want to appeal to your professors, by
    all means write about modernism in the 1920s, because they are academics who live
    in a dream world divorced from reality.\r\nJust remember that you will probably
    end up working in the real world.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Victrola_3744.jpg]\r\nHere
    is a high-tech audio ad from the 1920s.\r\nThe headline type is Benton's Cloister
    Bold, based on the 15th century work of Jenson.\r\nThe rest of the type is Goudy's
    neo-Renaissance design, Old Style.\r\nThis, rather than a poster by someone who
    taught at a small Weimar art school, is what most 1920s typography looked like."

    of the 1920's. the jazz age and blah blah, focus it on the more geometric typefaces
    that were meant to be big and decorative. anything on that would help to\r\n\r\nthanks

  body: "@kldolinger - the internet isn't anywhere near the biggest library in the
    world. Libraries are full of good books - 99% of the Internet is unsubstantiated
    crap, full of holes and misleading \"facts\" and biased articles by people with
    something to prove, so heavily slanted that you can't trust it.\r\n\r\nArt Deco
    is an interesting movement, but as others said here, it was marginal at the time
    and is only the focus of so much attention now due to its relevance to modernism
    and what came from it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately much design education today focuses
    only on what reverberated later, looking back at it through a lens colored only
    by things that informed later pop & trendy styles. It's an unfortunate fact that
    many of the design programs I've had experience with almost totally exclude the
    much more interesting and philosophically intricate Arts & Crafts influence that
    was peaking in the mid 1920s in all aspects of design.\r\n\r\nJoshua"

    in a library Nancy Troy, <em>[[http://www.amazon.com/Modernism-Decorative-Arts-France-Publications/dp/0300045549|Modernism

    to go to design school, I pursued journalism instead. Now I would love to study
    design but don't have the funds. Don't take this for granted, particularly if
    you want to be a designer. You're lucky to study this!
