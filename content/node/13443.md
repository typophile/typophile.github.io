  with letters drawn by myself.\r\nHowever, since they are of various weights, I wonder
  if it's possible to \u201Cinline\u201D the glyps (\uFB01nd the skeleton line) and
  then thicken the strokes to make them of equal weight?\r\n\r\nOystein"

  body: Wouldn't it be just as easy (or easier) to treat each glyph as a separate
    object, then adjust the stroke so that the weight appeared equal in all instances?
    Once you were satisfied with the results, you could outline the strokes, then
    do a little fine-tuning on alignment and sizing.

  body: "Thanks Nick.\r\nBut how would I do that? Is there any way to adjust the strokes
    to equal weight automatically in FontLab (or another program) or do I have to
    do this manually?\r\nBTW, the glyph's are all monoline.\r\n"

    but I suspect that, however capable the program (or drawing programs like Illustrator,
    Freehand or CorelDraw), a mathematical solution probably won't yield the same
    results as thoughtfully applying a creative eye to the problem.\r\n\r\n"
