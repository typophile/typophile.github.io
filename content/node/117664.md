  body: "Do you have any images showing such markings? \r\nMore a topic for an industrial
    archaeologist than a typophile. So my comments here are based on impressions rather
    than firm evidence.\r\nAny markings would be custom lettering rather than a typeface.\r\nIf
    the marking is engraved in metal I would expect something with thin lines and
    serifs. The taste for Sans Serif markings may have been deferred until the development
    of methods to use steel punches to place letters and numbers on metal. I don't
    know when this was developed, but my impression is that this may be a later development.
    \r\nIIRC metal castings sometimes included a name, but I don't know when the practice
    began. For technical reasons these could not include fine details.\r\nAs for lettering
    fashions in the early 1800s, this was the heyday of the high contrast Bodonis
    and Fatfaces. If a fancy letter was desired, it may have consisted of a Fatface
    with ornamented designs within the thick part of the stroke. \r\nIf the markings
    were painted I expect that they could be as simple or flourished as the maker
    wished.\r\nDon"
