  so far:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-Sans_3615.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  still very unsure about my skills (especially with the beziers) but hopefully I
  can finish this typeface. I have absolutely no background in graphic design nor
  type, except possibly for the influences I have acquired by reading stuff in the
  web. Books and other materials regarding typography are very sparse in my region,
  although I've acquired Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style (3.0) and Hochuli's
  Detail in Typography.\r\n\r\nI really want to finish this typeface, and I was aiming
  for a friendly yet clean sans-serif. It does look friendly to me, so far, but I'm
  not quite sure. Any comments, tips, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
  Thanks. :)\r\n\r\n<strong>Edit:</strong> New pdf attached."

    corners at the tops of the ascenders.\r\n\r\nA few  things I noticed:\r\n\r\n*
    The bottom of the o, p, and q don't overshoot the baseline (the d does).\r\n\r\n*
    the bottom of the bowl of the d could be smoother\r\n\r\n* I'm not sure if it's
    intentional or not, but the i has some square corners an some slightly rounded
    corners\r\n\r\n* the r needs to be taller\r\n\r\n* the curves n the p don't match
    the b, d, and q. Maybe it needs to be a bit wider?"

  body: "Thank you for your input. I'm glad you liked the lc a.\r\n\r\nI wasn't actually
    aware that glyphs with curves at the base should cross over the line, but now
    that you've said it, it does look off if, for example, the lc o just sits on the
    baseline.\r\n\r\nNow that you've mentioned it, the r should be a wee bit taller.
    I'm also aware that there are smoothness flaws in the lc b, d, q, and p. Will
    work on that asap. The lc i has some semi-serif qualities, and that is intentional.
    I tried a normal lc i before but it was too boring for my taste. I don't know
    if I should follow that pattern for the lc l, though.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure about
    your last point though. I want to retain the upper stem of r, n, and p for a distinct
    look, yet I don't want to copy that over to d, b, and q. I was actually thinking
    of an mirrored d for the lc b but I figured that would be too lazy of me. Haha.
    And it looked awkward anyway. So being aware of that, I tried to make differences
    with d and b. Now, lc p is derived from d and n, while q is from b (just a mirror).
    That's why, I think, the curves don't match.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for your
    comment. It helped a lot."

    a break first... and brace myself for creating an s.\r\n\r\nAs usual, comments

  body: "My comment about the lowercase i wasn't about the serif, but about the corners.
    Some are square, and some are slightly rounded (the lowercase l is the same way).
    You should probably pick one and be consistent throughout all the characters.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as the p, d, b, and q, I guess I shouldn't have said \"match.\"  They just
    need some more cohesiveness. They don't look like they all go together yet. Think
    of the curves like siblings. They don't look alike, but you should be able to
    tell they're related.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the bowl of the p is flat, but the
    b curves up just a hair. The d curves up, but it's uneven. The q curves up the
    most, and to me, is the nicest looking. All those curves don;t have to be identical,
    but they should share the same DNA.\r\n\r\nThe r still seems too short, and the
    t just looks awkward. It seems odd having the crossbar below the x height.\r\n\r\nYou
    could use the a similar stem on the j (which is quite nice) for the t, and make
    it taller.\r\n\r\nHave you started on your uppercase yet? I think when you do,
    you'll find that the ascenders on these lowercase characters are too low. \r\n\r\n"
