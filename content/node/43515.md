  Veer based on the merchandise deal at that time... DOH!!! nothing out side of North
  America..! eh?...  charge me the international shipping then... nope. See a merchandised
  product on Veer...  live outside of North America?... sorry no can do. It is not
  electronics or country restricted software, just shipping costs would make it expensive...
  then I will pay... nope.. sorry.\r\n\r\nWhen noticing fonts on Veer I like and as
  I cannot get little incentives 'like some typographically designed merchandise'
  I either try to find at the actual designers site (as I hope 100% of the money makes
  it direct to that font designer or foundry), or myfonts.com as they sometimes have
  little specials or I order more that Veer does not have... so Veer misses out?...
  \r\n\r\nI like incentives, when they are presented.\r\n\r\nAnother question, what
  foundry or font supplier gives more of the margin to the font designer, would too
  prefer to support that.. I tend to go designer first, then foundry... then the myfonts,
  veer, fontshop etc..."

    blame Bill gates ;-) Maybe you could have the merch forwarded to a \"friend\"
    in the USA or Canada and they can pass it on?"

    retro web design. Font Bros is often comes after other vendors in my mind because
    the web design builds such a strong association to the Mr. Retro and Font Diner
    products that I forget the fonts aren\u2019t all retro designs. It\u2019s not
    that I don\u2019t know better, but the whole jukebox theme can visually overwhelming
    and makes it harder to judge the types on their own merits."

    have purchased from House Industries, got the book all fine no problem, the House
    Industries book would weigh more than the cushions and a t-shirt. An idea for
    Veer, throw the cushions, the t-shirts and maybe a hat into the bag and ship it
    to me. Then I will get some photos done with me wearing the t-shirt and hat, with
    my House Industry book in my Veer bag, while relaxing on my Veer merchandised
    cushions.\r\n\r\nReally how sweet is it to get stuff like that in the post...
    we outside the US are being denied the experience of opening a FEDEX or other
    carrier 'signature required' parcels. Because sometimes the unzipping, un-stuffit,
    un-compress.... just does NOT cut it.\r\n\r\nWell looks like I may go to Amazon,
    House Industries or even sterling style HTFR (Hard to Find Records) and get myself
    some 'signature required' parcels so I can have some delight in opening them...\r\n\r\nI
    hope you understand... and in part jest"

    offers the designer 65% on BOTH the net sales amount AND any negotiated royalties
    . . . Many distributors drop to a 10% royalty on negotiated OEM licensing . .
    .\r\n\r\nIn addition, any sale that comes to the Font Bros by way of a direct
    link from the foundry garners an additional 5% of the TOTAL sale made so for instance
    if somebody came from BVFonts.com, MichaelDoret.com, HaroldsFonts.com, or MS-Studio.com
    to purchase fonts from us, we give that foundry an additional 5% of the total
    sale EVEN if the customer ended up NOT buying any of their offerings specifically
    . . .\r\n\r\nThat translates to a more than 70% royalty on every font sold through
    these folks and as far as I'm aware, is the best royalty offered through a 3rd
    party distributor . . .\r\n\r\nStuart"
