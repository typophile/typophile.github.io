  I need to use a special program? I have tried scrolling through charmap (Windows
  7) in the font to see if there are special ligature characters, but it doesn't seem
  so. \r\n\r\nI am using an old version of Paint Shop Pro, but I tried it in Photoshop
  as well and no ligatures. :( I feel like I'm missing something obvious, what is
  it?"

  body: "The discretionary ligatures are an OpenType feature that require support
    by the application. Graphics programs like the ones you mention may not have that
    support.\r\nOne possibility for accessing these features/glyphs in such a graphics
    program would be to type the text and trigger the features in another program
    that does support OpenType more fully, then cut the text from there and paste
    it into the graphics program. (For example, cutting from Illustrator and pasting
    into Photoshop.)"
