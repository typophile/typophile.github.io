body: "Hi everyone, I'm very new on these forums, and I'm already hooked on the type
  identification end of things, it's extremely good for learning about how typefaces
  are constructed.\r\n\r\nBeing half-Hungarian, one such construction I'm especially
  interested in is the double acute accent, the \"hungarumlaut\", that occurs in the
  letters /\u0151/ and /\u0171/. I've searched for threads discussing it and I can't
  find any, so I thought I'd check if anyone has posted on it before - and if not
  I'd love to hear some discussion on it from the esteemed type degniners here.\r\n\r\nThing
  is, looking through the typefaces on my hard drive, if they have it at all, a lot
  of them seem to get it simply <em>wrong</em> from what I understand Hungarian is
  supposed to read like. :) \r\n\r\nThe double acute accent is a long version of the
  umlaut; as I understand it, it is supposed to relate as directly to that umlaut
  as typographically possible. That means the spacing between the acute accents should
  <em>ideally</em> be the same as the space between the umlaut tittles, and the accents
  should <em>ideally</em> grow out upwards of the place the umlaut would have been.
  Below I've modified Arial (I know, I know!) to show sort of what I mean:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/umlauted_5267.png]\r\n\r\nOr
  look at the /\u0151/ in the modified Charlemagne in the header of [[http://www.gyomro.hu/|the
  website of this municipality]].\r\n\r\nNow, this is not always typographically possible
  - it can create an unbalanced and too-high glyph, I guess. But so many typefaces
  have double acutes that are very close to each other, much closer than the umlaut
  tittles, and in many the accents are very far to the left, centering the whole diacritic
  or even extending to the left when it's supposed to lean substantially to the right.\r\n\r\nAm
  I right here? Or have I misunderstood the problems of constructing this diacritic,
  or how it's \"supposed\" to be?"

    you get that idea? Have you seen the entry on <a href=\"http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=24\">diacritics

  body: "Okay, I've looked at a whole bunch of solutions from different print media
    and it varies substantially. \r\n\r\nIn signpainting (as in handwriting) the double
    acute is quite often just two vertical lines:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dac0_5263.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhereas
    in printing it can do very different things. Here's a book from the turn of the
    last century where the diacritic behaves pretty much as I describe it above: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dac1_5075.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's
    a recent engraved inscription where again it is more to the right and spaced wider
    apart than what's common in Western European fonts:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dac1b_6542.jpg]\r\n\r\nThen
    there's plenty of printed material that uses the diacritic more optically centered
    and tighter, of course. What's correct?\r\n\r\nAlso, to complicate things there
    are two more factors I hadn't considered, because I thought they were obvious
    but clearly are not! Firstly, relative size. In this example the double acute
    is bigger than both the acute and the diaresis:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dac2_4617.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    then there's relative angle (!). Look at the recent logo for this women's magazine:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dac3_5972.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    two acute accents are at different angles. This is not the only place I've seen
    that, either.\r\n\r\nIn general, a quick internet browse-through at the very least
    suggests that the diacritic should not be optically centered but lean a fair bit
    right. Right?"

  body: "Just one more to confuse. Here the lean is extremely to the right, the size
    is slightly different (I think) from the regular acute, the position is different
    from both the umlaut and the acute, and there's a slight difference in angle between
    the two accents, but it's the opposite difference to the magazine logo. From a
    recent, well-typeset Doring Kindersley book.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dac4_4244.jpg]\r\n\r\n(Oh,
    and you can always compare to the metrically centered, extremely tightly spaced
    accents on the Avant Garde (or whatever the geometric font is). Many different
    variants!)"

    find out what this accent \"should\" look like, I looked in Google Books for some
    old Hungarian books, and in my first two results, I found that the \"relative

    it's also smaller that both a single acute and an umlaut.\r\n\r\nHere's an image

    I can't say whether it would actually be helpful...\r\n\r\nI tried Googling information
    about Hungarian handwriting, but while I found the Wikipedia article on the double
    acute accent, I didn't find any information on what that accent meant to Hungarians
    through that either.\r\n\r\nHere's an example in an oldstyle typeface:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hacc3_4963.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    book contains text in Latin, German, Polish, and Czech as well as Hungarian. Apparently,
    it's a list of very old books, and so it tries to reproduce the forms of letters
    which they use on their title pages exactly. Thus, a very unusual accent appears
    at one point in the book, looking like a small lowercase e above the letter, and
    apparently used as a replacement for the umlaut.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hacc4_6121.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere,

    solution a similar attempt is the origin of the scandinavian \xE5, another letter
    that's incidentally often drawn \"wrong\" (with a zero-contrast, light ring even
    in sturdy, serifed typefaces).\r\n\r\nThanks for the other double acutes. There
    seem to be many, many solutions to this! Needs more investigation, perhaps - I'll
    look at a whole bunch more Google Books sources when I get home."

  body: "I had thought that the ring in the Scandinavian \xE5 is supposed to be a
    geometrical circle - not a raised letter o, with the sides thickened. If that
    is indeed its origin, I don't think I've <em>seen</em> a typeface in which it
    retained that vestige of it.\r\n\r\nIn another thread, I noted that while confusing
    the ogonek with the cedilla or a reversed cedilla produces very bad results visually,
    it resembles the Greek iota subscript accent. I didn't mean to suggest that was
    necessarily where it was derived from, but I think I was not clear enough on that
    point.\r\n\r\nThe versions of the double acute accent with the change in curvature
    are reminiscent of the Greek \"smooth acute\" polytonic accent. So, this could
    be a wrong form being used simply because it was familiar from another language,
    and the fact that it appeared in older books doesn't necessarily mean that it
    is what Hungarians would consider the \"right\" way to represent the accent in
    a text face. I wish there were someone from Hungary here who could provide some
    insight into why an apostrophe-prime form might, or might not, be more appropriate
    than a double-prime form for this accent.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, what is appropriate
    for Hungarian might not be appropriate for Faeroese..."

  body: "That is, the change in curvature form reminds me of Greek \u1F04, whereas,
    if the accent is meant to indicate a vowel that is both one which takes an umlaut,
    and one that is long, I would be inclined to imagine that it was decided that
    an acute accent coming out of the middle of a diaresis was rejected (I thought
    there was a Polytonic Greek accent like that, but I can't find it in the Unicode
    Greek Extended block)... and, if the idea of having \"two accents\" is rejected,
    I suspect that the current conventional practice - two small acute accents, close
    together and neatly centered, is what is preferred. The fact that there is two
    of them is all the reference to the umlaut that is required."

    old it may be:\r\n- I like the \xF6/\u0151 comparison in the first post, however,
    I have found it useful to move the accent of \u0151 a bit to the left to balance
    its leaning (on the other hand, I think that they have gone too far in the case
    of Gy\xF6mr\u0151's website)\r\n- The example which reads \"sz\xF6veggy\u0171jtem\xE9ny\"
    is the most comfortable for my eye; I might make the accent a bit smaller, but
    it is good as it is\r\n- I think it is a good idea to make the double acute lines
    shorter and more upright than the simple acute; but this might be just my taste.
    However, it is clear that this accent is not just two acutes next to each other!\r\n-
    Schoolchildren learn writing \u0151 and \u0171 with two parallel slanted lines.
    I would stick to this, I don't like the relative angle, it looks as if it was
    messed up.\r\n- Upright lines look really bad to the native eye. Avoid them."
