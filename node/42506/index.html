  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I realize this is a bit of a tangent from usual topics, but printers were discussed here a few times before and it seems like a good place to ask.

What's a good SOHO laser printer for high quality B&W text printing?  I'm not a pro, but I do a fair bit of DTP-like stuff and low-volume document printing would benefit from better-than-inkjet quality output.

I have been looking at 1200dpi printers in the $300-$400 price bracket but print quality leaves much to be desired.  For example, sample prints done on a Brother HL 5240N show that the printer rasterizes text at around 200dpi.  The result is unacceptably jagged output that looks awful compared to something done on a nine year old 600dpi laser.  I don't know where to look from here as the 5240 got top marks for text quality from various review outfits, even in competition with higher end printers.

What are people around here using for low volume B&W text output that doesn't look like sandpaper?

Thanks</div>

Go to Google, click on "Shopping" and type in the product you are interested in. You can get a pretty good sense of prices that way. It isn't a shell game.

		<div class="commentbody">Hello--I was silly and started my own laser printer thread and was kindly directed here by pattyfab. :)  I hope my joining the discussion won't be a hijack...

I'm very interested in the Ricoh Aficio BP20 or BP20N--they're more within my price range than the AP or SP series they have. On the specs, however, the BPs say "PCL 6" under "Printer Languages." The AP series lists: Adobe PostScript 3: 136 Type 1 fonts; PCL: 35 Intellifonts, 10 TrueType fonts, 1 bitmap font. Does this mean that the BP models are not PostScript? I'm not very fluent in this PostScript/printing language so all I gathered from wiki-ing PCL 6 is that PCL competes with PostScript. Does that mean that the BP models are emulators like the HPs you're discussing?

I appreciate your help! Thank you!

(I'm on OSX Leopard, MBP, running CS3--if this matters.)</div>

Alex, It's not a dumb question. The answer is that Post Script is "best of breed" for a wide range of reasons. But unless you spend heavily you can't have it. Sad but true.

		<div class="commentbody">Metalfoot -- For proofing typeface designs, it's very useful to use a printer with true Adobe Postscript. Postscript clones may possibly interpret code slightly differently -- for example, hinting instructions. Since commercial output for print will be processed and rasterized through a true Postscript interpreter, it's most useful to be reviewing your work in a workflow as close as possible to the likely result. 

For general design work, there are similar advantages -- things like color interpretation, layout features, etc. True Adobe Postscript will always be guaranteed of giving you a consistent industry-standard interpretation of the code. (There will of course be other limitations, based on the mechanics of a desktop laser; postscript rasterization is only one part of the puzzle.)

That doesn't mean that all PS clones are all rubbish. But you need to investigate to know whether a given rasterizer will perform according to your needs and expectations.

		<div class="commentbody">Also, many printers have entry which may say "Postscript : Yes" But upon investigation it will be emulated Postscript ( PCL6 etc). It amounts to false advertising as far as I am concerned.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was trying to look something up and stumbled on this old thread.

Just to clarify, PCL is *not* a PostScript emulation! It is a completely different page description language (PDL). HP printers typically *also* have a PostScript emulation built in.

		<div class="commentbody">How things change. My first PS laser printer, a GCC, cost me GBP 2500 in 1990. I got distracted into writing my own PS imposition program but I couldn't afford a PS interpreter for the PC (I had no Mac! still don't) to test it on. But the printer had a bi-directional serial port. I was able to send my generated PS code to it and read back the imposed output (which incorporated page creep allowing for folds in both axes, and what-not, and spot ink-trapping) to test on imagesetters. Pretty cool solution I thought at the time. As for the program ("Reproshop"), as it was on PC I couldn't even give it away. But it's how I learnt programming.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, so almost three years after the start of this thread, what's the answer for a low-end-priced, 1200 dpi, true Postscript, B&W laser printer? I was using a Xerox Phaser 3450B for about 6 years. I loved the quality. But it died suddenly a coupla months ago. I'm wondering about going the Xerox replacement for this model. Any thoughts?</div>
