		<div class="commentbody">When I started typesetting, the leading OCR package at the time boasted to "have an accuracy of 99.9%". Even if that claim were true, I <em>know</em>  from experience I make less than one single error per page when manually keying in 2,000 characters-a-page. I used to drive the proofreader crazy, making her wonder what she was gettin' paid for.

Ah ... perfect OCR ... once a promise for the future, and now it still is. Perhaps speaking into your iDevice and relying on speech-to-text is more reliable.</div>

And since they <em>have</em> to show they matter, they end
up changing things that were fine. Which is why I value
this advice that was once given to me: leave some small
mistakes in there that are sure to be cleaned up by the
proofreader anyway and make everybody happy.  :-)

Speech recognition? Still a ways off...

		<div class="commentbody">My gripe isn't with the quality of OCR (it's good beyond my wildest expectation) but with the willingness of publishers to put their name to the few but distracting errors which occur. Any OCR'd book was presumably adequately copy-edited and proof-read in the original, which dates from 'back in the day', so we don't really need to repeat that unless taking issue with anachronistic punctuation etc., all we really have to worry about is mis-read characters in the OCR process. These invariably result in gibberish; it doesn't need a skilled proof-reader to fix them, just anyone who knows how to use a spell-checker, and probably 1/10th of the time that proof-reading would take. I suspect the smaller and more specialised the publisher, the better this gets done, because their reputation is more sensitive to quality; certainly mine will be, and I take a lot of care over it. Of course my time is free while I have the day job. But I don't buy cost as the problem for larger publishers, just the fact that no-one gives a damn, because repeat business is not at risk; the reader won't generally know or care who the publisher is.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I remember estimating typesetting jobs in the 80s, and we worked on the basis that proofreading was 50% of the cost of the data entry. Scanning at 99% accuracy meant we still had to find the 20 errors per page it left, so that cost was not eliminated.Hard to explain to the scanner salesman why their $75,000 scanning systems were not attractive to our little shop that paid less than $10 an hour to a good proofreader.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">$75K! Clearly made sense at that time to do without and type it all in. My 'system' cost me about 0.2% of that in real terms. But for that, I do have to provide the motive power myself, typically at about 250 pages/hr., unless (rarely) I can sacrifice the book and put it through a sheet feeder.</div>
