  /img>\r\n\r\nCaecilia, designed by [[Peter Matthias Noordzij]], was issued by [[Linotype]]
  in 1991 as PMN Caecilia in a range of [[weight|weights]], including [[small capitals|small
  caps]] and [[text figures]]. This face is (perhaps) the first [[neohumanist]] [[slab
  serif]], with a true slab serifed [[italic]] to match. The italic is based on renaissance
  parameters, meaning it slopes at 5\xB0. This face is a graceful and sturdy slab
  serif, useful for various applications.\r\n\r\n<strong>External Links:</strong>\r\n<a
