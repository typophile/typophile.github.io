		<div class="commentbody">Tanya wrote: <i>The goal of the Org should be to keep profits down to 0.</i> <BR> <BR>You'll be glad to know that ATypI has been extremely successful in meeting this goal for many years. Unfortunately, this is often due to lack of revenue, rather than because revenue has been spent on providing resources to members. This is what I mean when I say that ATypI needs to increase revenue from membership fees, and in any other way it can, in order to improve its operational effectiveness. Every year, we get together and discuss all the things we would like to do to provide members with more benefits; we even make plans. Then we go back to our jobs, and over the course of the next year we're lucky if enough volunteer time is available to do a 20% of the things we discussed doing. Ideally, I would like to see ATypI in a position to make grants available to subsidise worthwhile projects that will benefit all type designers and typographers. Unless we find ways to increase revenues, this is unlikely ever to happen. I agree with Hrant that finding ways to make membership available to designers in countries with developing, unstable or depressed economies can have a positive impact on both the culture of the association and on its finances. While Tanya's idea is interesting and creative, I think it would distract the already over-extended volunteers who keep the association ticking. We need to find more efficient solutions, not more complex ones.</div>

This convinces me that adjusting membership fees relative to this index is both viable and desirable. <BR> <BR>I reject the idea that ATypI is 'geographically elitist': the figures I provide are explained by the historical origins of the association in an Anglo-European type industry. I've argued for a long time that the demise of that industry provides a positive opportunity for reform and renewal in the association; unfortunately, the demise of the industry has also produced the financial difficulties that make such reform and renewal a slow process. It has been too slow, and I intend to do whatever I can to invite membership from a more truly international community. <BR> <BR>Thank you to everyone who has participated in this discussion, which has prompted me to take a close look at the membership issue relative to national economic indicators.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">but why should we get &quot;educated&quot; on such an artform as typography? The techical knowledge is always there, you just grab the software or copy the tutorials or come to forums like this. The thing is that there is always the money issue but in reality the outcome is what counts. Besides, the more we pay for commercial events the bigger the names we help to make (only the names in some cases&hellip;) when there are a lot of excellent designers who have their work being sold by the majors but whose names are never around the events circuit&hellip; <BR>anyway <BR> <BR>Art is always going to be art and type is no exception. <BR>Thank god we still have a way of going it about with out font creations under our shoulder even without a degree.  <BR> <BR>im victor yb from mexico, disguised as an anonymous.
