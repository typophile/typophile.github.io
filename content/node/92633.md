  to TypeTogether's family. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eskapade-Fraktur-2_6336.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  [[http://www.type-together.com/Eskapade%20Fraktur|Eskapade]] family is the result
  of research confronting Roman and German blackletter forms, mainly fraktur letters.
  The idea is to adapt these broken forms for a contemporary use instead of creating
  a faithful revival of a historical typeface.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, [[http://www.type-together.com/Eskapade%20Fraktur|Eskapade]]
  is conceived for continuous text in books and magazines with a good legibility in
  smaller sizes, and on the other hand Eskapade directs the readers attention in headlines
  with its mixture of round and straight forms, like in \u2018e\u2019, \u2018g\u2019
  and \u2018o\u2019. It can also be used for visual identities, logotypes and packaging.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.type-together.com/Eskapade%20Fraktur|Eskapade
  Fraktur]] is more contrasted and slightly bolder than the usual darkness of a regular
  weight. The innovative [[http://www.type-together.com/Eskapade%20Fraktur|Eskapade
  Fraktur]] italic, based on the Cancellaresca script, is secondarily influenced,
  especially the capital letters, by the S\xFCtterlin forms. A unique script practiced
  in Germany in the short period between 1915 and 1941.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are
  many typefaces in the fraktur style available, only a few of them include true italic
  forms. Those are more slanted uprights though, rather than proper italics. This
  motivated and made extensive experimentation with the italic shapes possible and
  resulted in some unusual and interesting solutions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to standard
  capitals, [[http://www.type-together.com/Eskapade%20Fraktur|Eskapade Fraktur]] regular
  and italic offer a second set of more decorative capitals with double-stroke lines
  for ampliflying experimental use and creative application.\r\n\r\n<strong>more information:</strong>

    I had alluded to this sort of thing:\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/ss_fraktur2.html\r\n\r\nThe
    most notable thing to me is the rotational aspect of the Italic, which reminds
    me of the work of Gareth Hague (most of all his 2012 Olympics font, which I adore).
    I'd love to see more of that (and one day wrap my head around it well enough to
    implement it myself).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
