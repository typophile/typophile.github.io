body: "hi - first post to the board..\r\n\r\nI am working on a huge project, trying
  to find a warm, \"imperfect\" serif typeface akin to Mrs. Eaves (and Filosofia)
  . I have spent over 4 days searching and exploring with not too much success, so
  any pointers would be greatly appreciated. The closest I've come are Fountain type
  faces, but most of these are a bit too stiff for me.\r\n\r\nKeywords:\r\n\r\nWarm,
  human, well crafted, imperfect, vintage, hopefully a comprehensive number of weights.\r\n\r\nBy
  \"imperfect\" I mean that it does not matter if the typeface jumps a bit, like Eaves
  or is a bit uneven, as long as it gives off that familiar \"warmth\".\r\n\r\nMy
  last ditch effort would be to loosely interpret a given font by hand (pen/paper),
  but I haven't even been able to find a decent starting point. \r\n\r\nplease help
  - Thanks!"

    had eyes on Feijoa and now Typonine's Tempera (the Biblio serif'ed version is
    maybe not exactly imperfect and warm, but the entire set is very flexible, and
    from what I can see, well executed)\r\n\r\nWill keep looking, so keep the suggestions
    coming! Thanks again for taking the time."
