    with the occupation of \"computer\". More likely -- a roomfull of persons...\r\nMath
    skills were not necessary, at its basic level it was all done by simple additions
    and subtractions. Back at the end of the 19th century, they calculated \u03C0
    to a hundred digits (they made an error halfway through, tho')."

    hate to be the guy who goofed up on that one!\r\n\r\ncurious about the kerning
    of the 7 & 4. In a book of numbers the likelihood of 7 & 4 being next to each
    other and in that order is quite high. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: No kerning there. These are oldstyle ("medieval") numbers, tabular form. Kerning
    would mess up the tabular form, needed because you want to scan columns downward
    as fast and precise as possible.

    do it today things would be worse, because after I got 90% done someone from editing
    would tell me that the copy had never been proofed, half the numbers were wrong,
    and they all needed changing."
