  body: I think this bug is likely "by design". If you want pixel level control you
    should specify pixels?

  body: "Pixel is a bad unit for the font-size (line-height, letter-spacing, padding
    and borders as substitution for text-decoration and so on). I used it here for
    demonstration purposes only. If you use pt or em, you cannot use px for the line-height
    anymore, because one pt is converted to different numbers of pixels dependent
    from the relative screen resolution. On a high resolution screen you would need
    more pixel for correcting the line height.\r\n\r\n(Typographers have the tendency
    to design web pages pixel precise. I think, that it is one of the reasons, why
    typographers are not the best web designers.)\r\n\r\nI have an untested workaround
    for the Firefox versions, that support @font-face: You could provide a font, that
    contains the space only, and put it into the first place of a font stack. You
    can correct the line height by the font dimensions of the space-only-font.\r\n\r\nBut
    I would prefer it, if Mozilla would fix this bug. It is not directly a bug, but
    they had the specifications in mind only. They simply wanted to compute the height
    of the block as precise as possible. But the evenness of the leading is a thousand
    times more important. In case of the leading of body text one pixel is much."

  body: "That was fast, John. Thanks! A few years ago I stopped my commitment to Mozilla,
    when I was suspended on mozillazine (because I wrote, that some changes of the
    skin of Firefox were \u201Cbullshit\u201D, but that word seemed already too dirty
    for a few child protecting extremist moderators and a certain exorcist with a
    licence for being arrogant as bounty for more than 10000 posts). Well, my reaction
    was not less ridiculous. I thought, that anybody else would see the problem and
    report that bug, but I should have reported it by myself."

  body: "Firefox does this up and down rounding in other places, where it's actually
    a huge benefit compared to what the other browsers do (namely when dealing with
    horizontal percentage widths in a flexible container). \r\n\r\nSo I can see it
    being the 'norm' by design.\r\n\r\nThat said, I can't see a reason for it remain
    that way for line spacing. So while it may not be a bug, it really is something
    that should be looked at and fixed. "

    which popular apps, OS, or frameworks don\u2019t put text baselines on whole pixel
    boundaries? If InDesign or Acrobat can get away with it, then that might push
    browsers in the same direction.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n"

  body: "Subpixel baseline positioning? No, I don\u2019t think, that this has to do
    with subpixel baseline positioning. 0.95 em are equal tp 15.2 px, if 1 em is 16
    px. So, if the font size is 16 px and the line height 0.95 em, Firefox creates
    a line height of 16 px for every sixth line. And the height of the other lines
    is 15 px. Dependent from the fraction of em you have different line heights in
    the same text block. There is no other browser with that bug. I assume, it is
    a question of minutes to fix that bug! But it is not yet fixed, although it is
    documented since 2008.\r\n\r\nAgain, the problem can also appear, if the unit
    for the font size is em or any other unit."

    that has ever written software will roll their eyes at you if you say that. ;)\r\n\r\nIt
    may, though I have a hunch it's tied into the overall rounding algorithms used
    everywhere (see previous post). They likely don't see it as a bug, and perhaps
    a more useful approach would be to present to the Mozilla group as it being an
    exception that needs to be added. "

  body: "@ aluminium\r\n\r\nAbout which algorthm are you talking?\r\n\r\nIf the em
    is 16 px and the lineheight is defined as 0.95 em for the same element, then it
    has do be rounded down from 15.2 px to 15 px. That\u2019s the whole \"algorithm\",
    isn\u2019t it? If it exceeds 15.4 px, because the line height is defined as 0.975
    em for example, it has to be rounded up to 16 px."

  body: "@arno:\r\n\r\nIt's just a hunch. I'm basing that hunch on how Firefox does
    rounding elsewhere. For instance, if you set up a horizontal layout with TDs or
    DIVs all set to percentage widths, it does the same thing...it rounds up AND down
    to make sure the total = 100%. This is different than other browsers. IE rounds
    everything up OR down (so you end up short or over). Opera rounds everything down
    (so you end up short).\r\n\r\nMy thought was maybe it's a universal aspect of
    Firefox so not necessarily easy to change for one particular element (in this
    case line-spacing). \r\n\r\n"
