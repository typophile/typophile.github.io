body: "Hello --\r\n\r\nI am publishing a set of self-study guides for standardized
  exams, such as the SAT and the GRE, and would love some thoughts on coming up with
  a combination of fonts that might work well for the project. The books are fairly
  complex, and designed more like magazine articles (with asides, pull quotes, short
  quizzes, etc. scattered throughout), than like straight narratives. I need fonts
  for the following--\r\n\r\nMain body headings\r\nMain body text\r\nPull quotes\r\nHeading
  / body text for secondary articles (not sure of the official term for \"secondary
  articles\" -- basically shorter lessons that are separated out from the main lesson
  - each about a page or so)\r\nHeading/body for drills, quizzes, etc.\r\n\r\nFor
  whatever reason, most of the books in my field have been put together with very
  little thought or effort put into design (think 10 point times that runs across
  a full 8 1/2 inch page) and I feel that I can definitely set myself about by making
  some smart type and layout decisions -- of course, being a novice and admittedly
  a person of limited design sense, I could really use some help --\r\n\r\nThe impression
  I need to make is that the material is authoritative, smart, and personally/carefully
  crafted, in that order of importance.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any and all thoughts
  and help. If it helps, some of the fonts I gravitate towards personally (not necessarily
  for this project) include Adobe Garamond, Minion, TheSans, and FF Din.\r\n\r\n"

    of appearing \"fun\" - in fact that's one good way to stand out from the drones.\r\n\r\nBut
    \"fun\" doesn't have to equate to stupid, or hard-to-read. If you don't have <em>too</em>
    much continuous text, this might serve you well:\r\nhttp://ernestinefont.com/\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/99708\r\n(Disclaimer:
