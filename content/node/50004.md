body: "I woke up today with vague recollections that there was some kind of kit available
  for making one's own dry transfer rub down graphics. I'm not sure if it was a sort
  of photographic process or if it used copier/laser printer technology or some other
  common studio machine. It could have even been a way to make wet transfer decals,
  like those found in model kits.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know the details of such a material
  or process, or did I just dream it? \r\nPerhaps there is a service that will make
  them inexpensively nowadays."

    for the link.\r\n\r\nI'm just sure there was a home and/or studio kit to make
    these by yourself at one time."

  body: "I was also looking through my model train magazines. There is a \"paper\"
    that you can buy that will do transfers but I cannot find the supplier. There
    are however companies who will do custon transfers ... as in models. If you need
    those sites let me know.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    reference, and maybe help someone else out too.
