body: "Hello there.\r\n\r\nFirst post around here and maybe not so interesting to
  you guys, but I could use some tips regarding setting text ragged right in indesign.
  I usually set it justified and always manage to get nice looking blocks with that,
  but want to leave that now and discovered that accomplishing nice looking  right
  rags is actually more complicated than I thought.\r\nIn my settings I thought it
  would be a good thing to avoid as many as possible hyphens, but this of course causes
  an ugly right rag.\r\nDou you guys have ideas about reaching a nice compromise (few
  hyphens, nice rag)? Or is it a matter of fixing a lot of it 'by hand'.\r\nOh and
  I'm using Perpetua."

    hyphenate. I don\u2019t matter more than three hyphens at the end of lines as
    long as the word breaking makes sense and does even enhance reading comfort. Which
    is often the case in German texts. English of course has not that many compound
    words. If the hyphenation is a clear one what\u2019s so bad about it? A nice rag
    is always achieved by fixing it manually. In your InDesign settings you should
    not let the application do the paragraph composing. Nice idea though, but it never
    works as soon as you want to change the line break manually. And it\u2019s not
    a question which typeface you use. The narrower the column the harder it is to
    achieve a nice rag."

    so you can see and adjust kerning and tracking. This is a great way to look at
    the body of text holistically and pick apart outliers. Oh and don''t use Perpetua.
    Shift command h is the hyphenation command. '
