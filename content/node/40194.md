  it's likely that someone knows about this.\r\n\r\nI know wallpaper some both serif
  and sans fonts set as text. I am only wondering about the serif which bears a resemblance
  to the font used in Economist.\r\n\r\nSomeone can help?"

  body: "I found this on Economist's website\r\n\r\n\u2022 About our logo\r\nThe corporate
    logotype of The Economist has evolved from the gothic lettering used on the cover
    of the first issue, published in 1843, to the box device designed in 1959 by Reynolds
    Stone, a British engraver and typographer. It now incorporates a font from The
    Economist Typefamily, a typeface created specifically for our use.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    More details on the Economist typeface\r\nThe Economist has used a specially designed
    family of typefaces since May 1991. Development work focused specifically on how
    the new type family would respond to electronic transmission and different printing
    conditions at The Economist's seven international production sites. In our recent
    re-design a new typeface, Officina, was introduced for cover headlines and all
    navigational information. Ecotype, The Economist\u2019s main typeface, was also
    redrawn to make it easier to read. If you would like to buy a copy of our type
    family, or if you would simply like to find out more about it, please go to Agfa
    Monotype's website. "
