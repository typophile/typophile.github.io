body: "Hi all,\r\nI've been thinking about picking up a copy of Marshall McLuhan's
  <em>The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man</em>. I've been through
  <em>The Medium is the Massage</em> several times, but haven't ready any of his other
  stuff. Does anyone have any input on the book? Is it worth checking out?"

    interesting book. I can't say I've read <i>The Gutenberg Galaxy</i> though.

  body: You should buy that book. It's absolutely amazing how McLuhan establishes
    the relationship between the invention of the printing press and the delopment
    of the mind. One of the best of all time.
