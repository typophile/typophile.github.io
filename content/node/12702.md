  but less curvy, a little more agressive, a bit more literary.\r\n[article about
  dolly: http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/21831.html]\r\n\r\nI want to replace
  fournier I\xB4m using on this technology and art magazine - www.nada.com.pt\r\nFournier
  is too light and it has some problems. \r\nDolly its almost what I want...\r\n\r\nthank

  body: "Paperback was released ... hmm, 2 weeks ago ... I think.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion
    of Paperback was probably not correct at all. It isn't the same genre, but it
    strikes me as having some of the same friendliness and softness but in a stiff-upper-lip
    sort of way."
