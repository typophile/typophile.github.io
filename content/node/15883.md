body: "Greetings, all. Thought I'd post some samples of the display face I am currently
  working on to get some feedback. At this point I have the basic letterforms with
  various possible alternates, figures and basic punctuation. There is also only basic
  spacing and no kerning.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for taking a look and letting me
  know what you think."

  body: This would look interesting in very tight settings, for wordmarks or titles,
    with the serifs overlapping.

  body: "OK, this is my first contribution to \"critique\", and I'm feeling self-consious
    ... mostly because this font is so much better than anything I've done.  But I
    want to contribute, because I'm hoping to use this forum one day.\r\n\r\nFirst
    off, I really like the face, and think it's very successful. My only comment is
    that I did a stutter-step when I read \"sunshine\" because of the similarity of
    the \"h\" and the \"n\".  No idea what the solution is, because of the no-ascenders-no-descenders
    (semi-unicase?) design.\r\n\r\nThe only other thing that drew my eye is the dot
    on the \"i\". It stands out a bit; can it be reduced a little, or rounded off
    a hair?\r\n\r\nOK, I've made my comments, and I am ashamed: I feel like such an
    ogre, blasting someone's hard work. \r\n\r\nJay"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, folks.\r\n\r\nAnd no worries, Jay, I am looking
    for honest reactions here. You make a good point on both the lower-case h and
    the i; I'll give them some consideration."

    to see this.\r\nIs it meant to be unicase?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Yes, it is meant to be unicase with several alternates. One thing I'm still
    pondering is whether to have the lowercase be exactly the same glyphs as the uppercase
    or to include a set of alternates there. I might also use the "stylistic sets"
    for the alternates.

  body: One thing that you could possibly try out is to decrease the width on tail
    below the Q, especially since your serifs are so fine, it makes the Q stand out
    a little.
