    the upper part of lc \"a\" and \"f\" look very martin-majoor-ish though\u2026?"

      a very awkward 45\xB0 angle which reminds me of Charter or Matrix, fonts dating
      from the era of memory-saving designs with as little curves as possible."

  body: "I didn't mean to imply this was an actual Majoor typeface, this looks very
    much like somebody tweaked/decomposed and put whatever together again, a \"deconstructivist\"
    thingy. The lc_s completely falls out of the overall seriffed appearance, the
    whole thing has a very hybrid feel to it, as if it was put together from different
    fonts, etc. I don't think this is a released typeface, but I might be proven wrong
    in a minute :-)\r\nBut again, some parts, as mentioned above, remind me of Majoors
    approach to the respective shapes/chracterforms or parts of\u2026"

  body: "The typeface was designed about two years ago by Ludovic Balland (studio:
    the Remingtons, Basel, Switzerland). He named it \xBBStanley\xAB in honor of Stanley
    Morison.\r\nHe also used it in a series of bookjackets for \xBBDas Magazin Schweizer
    Bibliothek\xAB which can be seen <a href= \"http://www.schweizer-bibliothek.ch/reihe.html\">here.</a>\r\n"
