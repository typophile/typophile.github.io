  body: "The clipping in Word is related to a performance optimization that treats
    each line with in a paragraph as independent when it is rendered to the screen.
    The \u201Cempty\u201D space between lines is drawn as white, which can be drawn
    over other lines \u2013 and therefore clip those lines. When you print, the empty
    space isn\u2019t drawn so hence no clipping. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "The vertical metrics in the Gabriola font are set to prevent this kind of

    how Word interprets those metrics, though, and how it relates to user choices
    about how to specify linespacing.\r\n\r\nI would experiment with setting linespacing
    as absolute values in point sizes rather than multiples, as this often removes
    clipping, even if the resulting linespacing is identical.\r\n\r\nAs Si notes,
    the clipping should not appear when printed.\r\n\r\nI also advise against using
    stylistic sets 6 and 7 to address envelopes, unless you want all your mail to
    have to be manually sorted.:)\r\n"

  body: "<em>Coming from you that\u2019s kind of scary\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nWord linespacing
    used to be fairly straightforward: \xE0 la other MS text apps like Wordpad and
    NotePad, the default linespacing was determined by the combined OS/2 WinAscent
    and WinDescent metrics, as rounded to logical units for individual ppem sizes.\r\n\r\nIn
    Word 2007, MS made two significant changes:\r\n\r\n1. They set the default linespacing
    to be 1.15 times the vertical metric in the OS/2 table to increase the default
    leading. Typographically, this is an improvement in most Word documents with most
    fonts, since most such documents tend to have quite long line lengths relative
    to type size. [They also increased the default text size from 10pt to 11pt.]\r\n\r\n2.
    They implemented support for recognition of the OS/2 table version 4 fsSelection
    bit 7, which tells an application to use the OS/2 Typo metrics for linespacing
    instead of the Win metrics. In theory, this means that a font can have independent
    linespacing and clipping metrics, which means that fonts with some very tall variant
    glyphs, e.g. Gabriola, can have adequate non-clipping areas defined by the Win
    values, while not needing excessively large default linespacing. But this is where
    things get confusing and difficult to predict, because there seems to be a Word
    linespacing algorithm that in some situations produces linespacing that is independent
    of the font metrics. It looks like the Office developers implemented support for
    fsSelection bit 7, saw some fonts in which they didn't like the result of using
    the Typo metrics, and decided to bypass the metrics and apply algorithmic linespacing.
    This means that in some fonts the Word linespacing is defined by neither the Win
    metrics nor the Typo metrics, but by Word, in a way that does not appear to be
    publicly documented.\r\n\r\nAs noted in my response above, whether clipping occurs
    depends on how the user specifies linespacing in the paragraph properties dialogue.
    If linespacing is specified as a multiple of the basic spacing, then clipping
    will occur if the specified value results in spacing that is tighter than the
    Win metrics (or, I suspect, tighter than Word's algorithmic spacing). But if the
    linespacing is specified as an absolute value, then clipping usually won't occur,
    even if the resulting linespacing is equally tight.\r\n\r\nI have not looked at
    Word 2010 linespacing to see if it is the same as 2007."

  body: Much too complicated, all printed fine without cut offs. All envelopes delivered-
    they were Christmas cards so no urgency. Might include the postal barcode if Gabriola
    is used in the future. Still haven't found a way to use stylistic set 7 in InDesign.
    Oh well.

    is possible with a little trick, by activating the built-in World-Ready Composer.
    On Thomas Phinney's website there is <a href=\"http://www.thomasphinney.com/2009/01/adobe-world-ready-composer/\"
    target=\"_blank\">an article</a> about it, including an InDesign template document
    and scripts by Peter Kahrel both of which allow to activate the WRC. This screenshot
    shows some text typed right into the template document, with Gabriola and Stylistic
    Set 7 applied:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gabriola_SS07_in_IDCS4_5382.gif]\r\nThis
    is in CS4. I assume it works in CS5 too."

    I don't think this is a WRC issue.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a bug in CS4 that
    results in the last stylistic set feature present in a font not working (even
    if there is only one stylistic set feature). In the case of Gabriola, this means
    the stylistic sets 1-6 work fine, but set 7 does not. I don't know if this is
    fixed in CS5."

  body: My interpretation was that "ss07" does not work in InDesign because its native
    layout engine, in contrast to the WRC, is ignorant of type 2 lookups [one-to-many]
    which are involved in Gabriola's Stylistic Set 7. Other fonts' last Stylistic
    Set features seem to work in CS4. Of course it were nice if Adobe apps would support
    all lookup types by default.
