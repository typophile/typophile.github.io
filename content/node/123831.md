    derived from Jenson Roman, such as Centaur, designed in 1914 by Bruce Rogers for
    the Metropolitan Museum in New York which in revised form looks like [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CentaurAsPORTOBELLO_6728.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/centaur/\r\nOtherwise, the lettering is fairly
    generic Roman, with some of the flavor of fonts like Laudatio Light [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LaudatioLightAsPORTOBELLO_4034.gif]

    searched for some time and found a number of interesting articles online, but
    no definitive answer. Have to agree with Don that it is likely bespoke, and not

    live in an age of standardization. To think that any contemporary road signage
