body: "Nova Mono is a monospaced font designed for programmers.  It takes the best
  of programming specific fonts as well as book fonts and attempts to bring them together.
  \ This font is heavily inspired by many of the existing monospaced fonts especially
  Consolas and Pragmata.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI just want to say I love this community
  and all the positive discussions that I've read here.  This is my first post as
  well as my first font.  I'm developing a monospaced font partly to learn what it
  takes to make a font and partly to make a font that I can use while programming.\r\n\r\nMotivations\r\n-
  Keep the more mechanical and digital look of a font like Pragmata\r\n- Apply some
  of the strengths of more natural monospace fonts like Consolas\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-
  Primarily Anti-aliased screen reading\r\n- Print is secondary, but should look nice
  blown up\r\n\r\nThis is only the first revision, but I would love some feedback
  on the general shapes of the glyphs.  I'd also like to hear your opinions on the
  font in general.  Thanks!"

  body: "You've got some nice shapes going! I like that \"O\". And the \"g\" is nice.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the widths seem [unnecessarily] off (like the \"o\" looks wider than the \"p\")
    and such, but I think the first thing you should look at are different sorts of
    optical corrections, without which your font will look clumsy in terms of finish.
    \r\n\r\nLike Mikey says, one of these is the thinning at joins. If you look at
    your \"a\" for instance, notice how where the \xABfoot\xBB branches off at the
    bottom-right, there is a rather large area of black. If you print it out and squint
    at it, that will look like a little black blob. These amassments of black need
    some evening out \u2013 meaning, essentially, you need to cheat to make it look
    correct. One way to think about it is that the strokes should get a little thinner
    where they join. Another approach is to look at the negative white space (like
    the little notch coming up from the bottom) and carefully enlarge that.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing that caught my attention is that you don't seem to have any overshoots.
    See how in your \"n\", the \xABstem\xBB looks like it's just a bit higher than
    the arch? How your \"o\" looks a bit shorter than your \"i\"? Round shapes need
    to be slightly taller mathematically than flat ones to look right.\r\n\r\nThe
    third thing is that horizontals need to be slightly thinner than verticals. If
    you look at your \"I\" or \"H\" you will see that the horizontal bars look slightly
    too heavy.\r\n\r\nOne of the most fascinating things about type design (and I'm
    really not such an expert either), to me, is learning to actually perceive these
    weird little tricks the eye plays, and work with them. For an introduction I recommend
    you have a look at this helpful paper by Mark Jamra on optical corrections: <a

  body: "Thanks for the helpful comments nina.  I've been trying to thin the joins,
    but I'm having a hard time incorporating that with the squared ovals/rounded rectangle
    motif that I'm looking for.  I've attached what's I've been working on on the
    bdpq group.  I still feel like something's off though.\r\n\r\nI've raised the
    x-height, and tried to go more towards the rounded rectangle shape.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nova

    \ Also I know there's some uneven thinning in the 'o' near the corners.  I'll
    address that presently.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    they have much more liberal of an inside on the 'b' and 'd' with a sharp downward
    slope much like the b below.  Progress has kind of slowed and I'm waiting to get
    a printer/scanner to that I can work on it by hand a little more.  Open to suggestions
    as always.  Not sure about the spacing of the 'i' either.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nova

    to be able to easily distinguish similar letterforms at small sizes. The 1, l,
    I, |; O, Q and 0, and (), {} and [], ', `, and \" and the curly quotes, even comma
    and period, and so on. \r\n\r\nI like what you have going on here, but I'd want
    to see a fuller character set before passing judgment. \r\n\r\nCheck out these

    is the best programming font out there, IMHO. "
