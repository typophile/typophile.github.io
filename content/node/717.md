body: Howdy. <BR> <BR>So I am really fed up with trying to proof my designs on an  <BR>inkjet.
  Anybody have any suggestions on a good laser that I  <BR>can get reliable prints
  from? I want to spend less than  <BR>$1000. I&#39;d like to spend a lot less if
  that&#39;s possible. I&#39;d  <BR>definately consider a used machine. <BR> <BR>Currently
  I&#39;m going to Kinkos and chucking coins into the  <BR>machine &#40;a Xerox 4050
  or something - pretty good&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Randy

  body: You can&#39;t really use an inkjet to proof your type; the output is invariably
    heavier no matter how good the paper is. Even a laser can be quite unpredictable.
    You have to always keep the toner at a reasonable level, otherwise it is hard
    to have a consistent distribution of toner on the page. I have an HP LaserJet
    6MP. It&#39;s 600 dpi and it served me well for seven years, but I could do with
    a better machine. You can pick up a 1200 x 1200 dpi HP for well under $1000 now,
    so don&#39;t go for a used one.

    a year-and-a-half ago or so. I suspect you could pick one up fairly cheaply. It
    has the ProRes feature &#40;true 1200 dpi, which is camera ready quality&#41;.
    Probably all kinds of stuff out there.

  body: Beware laser printers that are not true PostScript. Most low-cost ones out
    there are PostScript emulators. When I was in the market for a new printer a couple
    of years ago, after the death of my beloved Personal NTR, I went through a hellish
    process of trying to find a reasonably priced laser with real PostScript. <BR>
    <BR>The problem is that most salespeople have absolutely no idea what the difference
    is, and some manufacturers are not totally up-front about the fact that theirs
    is an emulator. I bought a couple and then returned them, after discovering that
    the emulation was beyond awful. <BR> <BR>I finally ended up finding a used Apple
    16/600 &#40;which is very similar -- if not identical, structurally -- to an HP
    5MP, I believe&#41;, and it creaks a little, but I&#39;m plenty satisfied. I paid
    $225 for it.

  body: I have a non-PS HP LaserJet 3200, a letter-size non-duplexing unit with fax
    and &#40;sheetfed&#41; scan capabilities, bought three years ago for $350 or so.
    There&#39;s an M version with Postscript as well, but I was too dumb to get it.
    Not big enough at this point, but the 1200dpi output is gorgeous and the toner
    cartridge has a fair capacity. <BR> <BR>About a week ago I bought a Lexmark C720
    for a steal. The C means color. The color isn&#39;t too good, and there&#39;s
    only a black cartridge in it now &#40;CMY will be an extra $600!&#41; but it&#39;s
    PS so I can finally print from my Mac, hallelujah. <BR> <BR>The best PS printers
    these days are Xerox. Lexmark is also good. AVOID HP. They have gone WAY downhill...
    especially their PC printers, which install some crazy proprietary print driver
    that bypasses all of Windows&#39; own print UI. Just give me pure, unfutzed-with
    Postscript 3, thank you.

    <BR> <BR>2400 is slightly lighter than 1200, &#40;very close to how the type looks
    at repro resolutions&#41; but the real difference is in the detailing. Shapes
    and forms that create &#34;spots&#34; in lower resolutions look cleaner at 2400.
    <BR> <BR>Conversely type color that looks even at 600 or 1200 looks spotty at
    2400. <BR> <BR>An &#34;unnamed&#34; cut of Akzeiden Grotesk I once proofed at
    600 looked great, but at 2400 it looked terrible. It looked terrible in film as
    well.'

  body: Good point; the darkening is much more severe with small point sizes. <BR>
    <BR>I have attached two versions, one at actual size &#40;at 72 dpi&#41; and one
    close up. I think that they will give an idea of the difference. I had to get
    rid of the paper texture &#40;the printed example was on very textured paper&#41;
    but I tried to keep the type from bulging. I hope these examples appear. I have
    never posted to a forum before yesterday, and am a little new to this. <BR> <BR>The
    details &#40;in my opinion&#41; are captured well &#40;except for very fine differences&#41;
    however the feeling is generally darker. This can be a problem when you are dealing
    with the color of the text in comparison with other graphic elements, or very
    large type &#40;which looks impecable&#41; with small type. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/24603.jpg"

    alt="close up -- 1200 dpi"> <BR> <BR>However, despite these shortcomings, I am
    still very pleased with the printer. When we print out first pages for a book,
    it takes only 1 hour, with no printing errors &#40;aside from our own&#41;. This
    is in comparison to the day and a half we used to have to set aside for printing
    on our ink jet... and I cringe to think of all of the streaked sheets... and the
    cost of ink! <BR> <BR>I hope all this helps, <BR>Robert <BR> <BR>P.S. I actually
    have been wondering about something related to this topic and I wonder if anyone
    has any thoughts...  <BR> <BR>Has the direct-to-plate technology changed the thickness
    and color of type &#40;made it thicker&#41;?  <BR> <BR>I have wondered about how
    the films &#40;which are negatives&#41; made type thinner, especially thin lines.
    However, direct-to-plate, which I think is more similar to a laser printer, dosen&#39;t
    go through the negative step, and may reseult in thicker type. Or type that is
    more like laser output.
