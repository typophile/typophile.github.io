body: "This is a logo I am working on for a literary conference. It is heavily type
  based because the inspiration comes from the opening spread of James Joyce's Ulysses.
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JOYCE-S-logo-bag-ID_4087.png]\r\n\r\nPlease
  note 2 things: \r\n\r\n1. I probably will not be able to make any drastic changes
  because we are coming down to the wire and we have gone through a lot to arrive
  at this concept.\r\n\r\n2. The concept is based on the original spread, but I have
  taken creative license in an attempt to help the concept work as a logo.\r\n\r\nThat
  having been said, any feedback is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n\r\nDuncan"

  body: "  Ahoi Duncan,\r\nall in all I like the logo; it's  just that I liked the
    first composition better. \r\nThe second is too static (for a joice conference
    :)\r\nMaybe something in between?  \r\nAnd I'd use 'real SmallCaps' and give the
    textblock a bit more contrast. \r\nSee attachment (here with: Garamond Premier
    Pro / Semibold Caption / Bold Subhed (Bold Italic) / Regular\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JOYCE-S-logo-FINAL-2-Kopie_5301.png]\r\n\r\nBest
    Regards"

  body: "Your J seems a little flat at the base, emphasised in your second iteration
    by the text placed under it. My inclination for your first post would be to move
    the text up so that the fourth line lines up with the base of the J. I think the
    lack of asterisk in the second one is better, because that line looked a little
    spotty with the punctuation. I think it is worth adjusting the leading slightly.\r\n\r\nTim"
