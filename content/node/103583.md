body: "A question about EULA and pdfs. \r\n\r\nI'm making a small-scale magazine,
  and I want to put it online so you can pay by paypal and get a mail with the pdf.
  So, this might be a newb question, but I guess its better to ask and be safe than
  to play cool and be sorry (or fuck someone over). I'm going to use a font by Commercial
  which EULA reads\r\n\r\n<em>For the purposes of this Agreement, \u201CCommercial
  Product\u201D shall also mean, among other things, a user editable electronic document
  created by Use of the Font Software which is offered for distribution to the general
  public (or to some subset of the general public), in Flash type software distributed
  or exhibited, in gaming products or software where the extraction of the Font Software
  or the designs embodied therein may be extracted; or use on goods for sale as a
  commercial product in exchange for a separate fee or other consideration. However,
  a document distributed in connection with a commercial transaction in which the
  consideration is unrelated to such a document (for example, printed advertising,
  a business letter or a receipt for purchase of tangible goods such as clothing),
  or as other design materials distributed incidental to the purchase of goods or
  services, shall not be considered a Commercial Product.\r\n\r\na) Except as may
  be prohibited herein, you are permitted to electronically distribute a \u201CPersonal
  or Internal Business Use\u201D document (that is, a document other than a Commercial
  Product as defined above) (i) that is in a static graphic image (for example, a
  \u201Cgif\u201D) or in an embedded electronic document, and (ii) which is distributed
  in a format that permits only the viewing and printing (and not the editing, altering,
  enhancing, or modifying) of such static graphic image or embedded document. Personal
  or Internal Business Use shall not include any Use of the Font Software by persons
  that are not members of your immediate household, your authorized employees, or
  your authorized agents. All such household members, employees and agents shall be
  notified by you as to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and shall agree
  to be bound by it prior to use of the Font Software.\r\nb) Use of the Font Software
  in sIFR (Scalable Inman Font Replacement) and Cuf\xF3n is permitted. However, the
  use of @font-face or other forms of web embedding or web font replacement technologies,
  (\u201CFont Replacement Technologies\u201D) other than pdf as otherwise expressly
  permitted herein, each require the purchase of a license upgrade.</em>\r\n\r\nCommericals
  nifty \"what this paragraph means\" reads \"If a reader or user cannot create new
  content using one of our fonts in a PDF or Flash application, and the complete font
  is not embedded, no additional license is required.\". So what I'm wondering is,
  what is meant by \"the complete font is not embedded\"? If I put up a normal pdf,
  is this ok as long as it isn't editable? Is it possible to \"hack\" and extract
  a font from a normaly exported static pdf?\r\n\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>what is meant by \"the complete font is not embedded\"?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nExactly
    what it says. The two most common options when embedding fonts in a PDF are:\r\n\r\n1)
    to embed the complete font, which would mean all of the characters/glyphs, regardless
    of whether or not they have been used to generate the content.\r\n\r\n2) to subset
    the font, which will only include the characters/glyphs required to display the
    content. This would appear to comply with their requirements.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Is
    it possible to \"hack\" and extract a font from a normaly exported static pdf?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYes,
    if you have used one of the embedding methods mentioned above. However, not all
    of the font data is retained and you are usually left without metrics data such
    as the kerning. If by \"static\" you mean that the text has been transformed to
    outlines or rasterised prior to being exported, then no font data, other than
    the design, will be retained in the PDF."

    and in accordance of the posted EULA?

  body: If you sell the magazine to the public, it would appear to be a commercial
    product. You've given the embedding rules for uses other than commercial products.
    What are the rules for commercial use?
