body: "It was mentioned that Sumner Stone has reduced his type prices (in another
  thread) and while on his site I note that he has offered some incredible offers,
  with site licences available for under $4 per computer (in volume). \r\n\r\nStone's
  library is not wide enough to be a complete collection on its own, but for such
  a small price it certainly is an effective top-up to Adobe's educational package.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stonetypefoundry.com/\r\n"
