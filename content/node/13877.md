body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Ductus</strong>\r\n\r\nDuctus is the
  path the writing implement makes in forming a letter. Typefaces are formed by other
  tools than the (broadnibbed or flexical) pen, but the contrast patterns of the shapes
  that are constructed in type traditionally paraphrase the shapes formed by the stroke
  of the pen. Every typeface that deliberately imitates the broadnibbed pen has (or
  borrows) a ductal logic.\r\n\r\nSee also [[Modulation]], [[Ductal Logic]].\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
