  body: "I read previous threads. I also standard sized the glyphs in Spoleto [Novel],
    OptiSport Script, and Aktuelle [Brendel] for comparison. There is little difference
    between the three and the differences may be due to errors in format conversion.
    The Opti version looks better made than the other two and appears to have the
    earliest creation date. The [unauthorized] archive of fonts from this defunct
    company states that the original is _Athletic Script_. This is the name the embroidery
    companies now use for this script, but I can find nothing on Athletic Script as
    a regular font. For further info, Google _fonts athletic script_.\r\nBTW Monotype
    owns the font name _Spoleto Regular_ and uses it for a very different font designed
    by Hans Bacher in 2001, and originally called Tuscany http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Spoleto&q=Go\r\nOn
    balance, if I was to use a name for the script in the sign, I would go for Athletic
    Script.\r\nDon\r\n"
