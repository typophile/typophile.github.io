  looking for an 'all things design and type' forum for some time now and think I
  found it here. \r\n\r\nMostly b/c of the cool vibe and wealth of knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
  I hope to find small and big ways to contribute.\r\n\r\nTill then, cya round!\r\n\r\n--new2me\r\n\r\n3
  things to know about new2me\r\n\r\n1) I recently discovered Berthold Akzidenz (love
  it!)\r\n2) I spent 3 years setting FF Scala at the architectural firm as their in-house
  creative. Good times for the most part, but I recently left this past November to
  start my own practice.\r\n3) My favorite font right now is PS Courier. Courier gets
  no love. :(\r\n\r\n"
