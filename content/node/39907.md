  this is derived from an old display type of mine, I figure it ought to stay with
  the display category.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_0249_5601.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is based pretty loosely on my old [[http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2205|Gohan]]
  font, available for free if you'd like to compare."

  body: "This is really nice! The 4 is so great.\r\n\r\nA few characters that kinda
    bug me are the lowercase v, maybe could be more pointed at the bottom. \r\nI think
    the diagonal on the capital X is too thick. Perhaps the top of the capital T as
    well.\r\n\r\nI can't wait to see this finished."

  body: "You're right about the x there. Most of these letters are based in the Gohan
    font skewed 10\xB0 (heavily modified thereafter). The swelling of the downstroke
    diagonals, most obvious in the X, is an artifact of that.\r\n\r\nI'm glad you
    like the 4, though. It has kind of troubled me, since it is a descending numeral
    among an otherwise lining set of figures. It is, however, the least derivative
    from the upright of the set.\r\n\r\nI tried making the v more pointed, but that
    just resulted in the vertex being too thick, and II had trouble fixing that with
    a deep ink trap. That solution worked on the uppercase but to make it deep enough
    to be visible in the lc distorted the strokes too much."

    something that might not be a big issue. If you design the G with a descender,
    why not giving the Y one as well?\r\n\r\nBy the way, very interesting stamp."

  body: "The font is still a bit half-baked. The G has a descender because it didn't
    look good without one, though I find it looks deflated as it is. The Y looks just
    fine without a descender, in my opinion, but I would definitely like to make some
    swash alternates eventually, and those would include a long Y.\r\n\r\nWhich ampersand
    do you like?\r\nand that 3 shaped Z; what's up with that?"

    think it's time to see some settings. Maybe some increasingly dangerous cheeses...\r\nhttp://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/lists/29LucasKlauss.html"
