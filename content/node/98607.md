    on what you need, the logo itself is freely available to download as vector [[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/logo/ibanez|here]]
    or you could try to reproduce it starting (even if it sounds clich\xE9) from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/|Helvetica
    Black Oblique]] adding serifs and connections (hardest part would probably be
    to recreate almost entirely /e)."
