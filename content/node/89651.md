  body: "So a bunch of Typophiles leave to start their own web site because they dislike
    hrant, yet they let people like Montalbano join?\r\n\r\nMaybe hrant is annoying,
    but he's not a vandal, at least. \r\n\r\nI'm kind of losing respect for a chunk
    of the type community here. Seems like a petty bunch of personalities (or, at
    least a petty bunch of online personas). \r\n\r\nI'm sure that's not how it truly
    is, but that's how it feels--at least from the perspective of us on the sidelines
    watching the online sparring going on. \r\n\r\n"

    (read: people you get along with) does not lead to cultural progress*; that might
    be the reason the \"other forum\" (started BTW by a former student of James) seems
    to be going nowhere fast. In contrast, I thank my lucky stars that Nick Shinn
    has been a stalwart member of Typophile all these years.\r\n\r\n* http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19202527\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I recall good information coming from both hrant and james and it's just so very,
    very weird what has happened around here over the past year. All online communities
    ebb and flow and some linger on and some blow up. 'tis how it is, I guess. \r\n\r\n"
