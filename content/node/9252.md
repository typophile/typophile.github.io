body: Hi, i&#39;m looking for some infos, links of fonts about this designer,  <BR>also
  known as Sue Laporte on emigre&#39;s site. Anyone&#39;s got some clues to share
  ? <BR>I know she has released few faces, and the few i&#39;ve seen where very nice.
  <BR>I&#39;ve searched on Luc Devroye&#39;s site, here also but nothing.
