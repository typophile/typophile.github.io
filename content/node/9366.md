  body: The right column of marks looks like, &#34;CYKA&#34; to me. <BR>It&#39;s a
    strange effect, but I read the D as an A in all of them. <BR>Try rounding the
    right side of the D just a bit.

  body: Dragan, tell me more about the art and history of Karate. Don&#39;t just make
    a design for design sake. Make it reflect the subject with respect to its history
    and its discipline.

  body: 'yeah it&#39;s a very good one. <BR>i made a similar graphic to it some 4
    years ago. <BR>I gave it to my girl&#39;s dad, he showe the design to his printer
    who was supposed to make tshirts with the dragon graphic. the deal went sour so
    they never printed it. <BR>only to my suprise i saw my graphic in some karate
    equipment catalogue, yes, you can guess from here, it was printed on tshirts.

    <BR> <BR>i&#39;ll get you that graphic, i just have to find it. <BR>this is a
    good reminder, but i was actually trying to get away from the dragons in martial
    arts cliche, at least here all the martial art clubs have a dragon in some form
    in their visual identity. <BR> <BR>i&#39;ll go find that dragon now. <BR> <BR>PS
    <BR>heh : dragon-dragan, haha <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
