body: "Putting together a personal portfolio site and although I'm not \"in business
  for myself\" I'm considering using something of a pseudo-logo to go with the \"theme\"
  of my website. \r\n\r\nThe website itself has a \"1920s telegram\" feel with some
  modern elements to it, and this logo evolved based on a Western Union logo of the
  same era with some changes.  This isn't really going to be a real \"brand\" though--not
  in the sense of the way real companies use logos.  Oh, and one more thing, the actual
  \"tagline\" here is somewhat \"for position only\".  I want some obligatory cliche-type
  text/slogan found in 20s signage to go here but I don't know that the text I actually
  placed here will stay.\r\n\r\nAnyway, looking for any general opinions though on
  the typefaces, kerning, design, etc., to see if any glaring problems jump out at
  anyone.  Thanks!"

  body: As a non-logo graphic meant to give flavor I think it's pretty good. If you
    were going to use it as a logo I would make it punch harder - but for your described
    purpose it seems good. Care to show us the context you will be using it in?

      on a distressed-paper background and \"vintage\" type fonts.  That's about as
      much as I can provide immediately.  \r\n\r\nWould like to hear suggestions on
      the \"punch harder\" part though, just for future reference!\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I like the mark it fits with the era but might be more 1940s than 20s. You
    might consider using Mr. Retro's Machine Wash filters on the mark to give it an
    aged look. Also check out Font Diner fonts while you are at it.

    body: "Experimented with the Machine Wash filters per your suggestions; added
      an attachment above of those highlights.  \r\n\r\nYou may be right about the
      era; I'll have to take that into consideration in the design of the context
      around it.  \r\n\r\nNot sure if Font Diner had anything in the vein I'm looking
      for--most of those typefaces seemed 50's and 60's to me."

  body: Misfeed looks best to me. The others seem to subtle. I still want to see some
    more context for use - even if it's rough. I can imagine to a point but...

  body: I agree with Eben I like Misfeed. Whats cool about those filters is you can
    control the effect because they are layer masks

  body: "Thanks for all these suggestions--Wow--these E-phemera and Archive Type fonts
    are really cool.  More temptation!  \r\n\r\nActually did purchase the HPLHS Prop
    Fonts (they're a steal).  The type appearing below each Machine Wash example in
    the comp above is the Gothic from that collection--and I make use of that font
    on the site itself.  Went with ITC Blair instead in the logo though.\r\n\r\nBased
    on these comments I may make the Wash effects a bit more severe (these are subtle
    as Eben mentioned, as I actually left the effects on the subtle-side).  Food for
    thought.\r\n\r\nAlso will perhaps will put some of the context up as soon as I
    can semi-finalize a bit more of it.  Thanks! "

  body: "Also, with the effect you have the option of making it subtle in print &
    less substle online - And more subtle as the 'logo' scales up in size & maybe
    less subtle if it will be small. The effect is meant to be a bit random after
    all!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I appreciate the aesthetic, very 'obey giant'\r\n\r\nI don't really think
    the filter applied matters much, but play into the filter with the texture of
    what it's on.  A more cloth type filter on a flag, more bricky type on a masonry
    thing.  Play into that."
