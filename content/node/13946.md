    target=\"_blank\">Here</a> is a better digitization called Erbar.\r\n\r\nAnd David
    Nalle's version, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/brandegoris/brandegoris/testdrive.html?s=TREVISO&p=72\"
    target=\"_blank\">Brandegoris</a>, which includes lots of nifty alternates.\r\n\r\nOK,
    this appears in the Solotype Catalog as Erbar Initials, so I assume that it was
    designed by Jakob Erbar rather than S.H. de Roos. Can anyone confirm this (and
    maybe even give a year)?"

  body: "Thanks Sander!\r\n\r\nFunny, I was just on your website a few minutes ago
    checking your Nick Curtis font notes and sources. I thought that he'd made a font
    based on Roco, but I guess I was mistaken."

    variants of Roco (which is a redesign of Grock) I think are beautiful too. If
    you are interested, check P22 Art Deco (Carima Al Behairy, P22), GangueOuais (Darren
    Rigby, Starving 4 Entertainment) and Signum (a Grockified Broadway by Karl Nayeri,
    Prime Graphics).\r\nThe Belgian company Alfac had a font called Spats but it was
    never digitized."

  body: Yes, there are lots of fonts that have bits and pieces of Roco. Others include
    Marquee Mieux (WSI), <a href="http://www.elfring.com/artdeco1.htm" target="_blank">Dalith</a>
    (Elfring), and <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/lullaby.htm" target="_blank">Lullaby</a>
