body: "Jon Lund is a fantastic digital illustrator ( www.jonclund.com ) I was a former
  subscriber to a publication called, SBS Digital Design. In the June 2002 issue,
  Jon C. Lund was a contributing author on a technique he uses to replicate the WPA
  posters of the 30's/40's. The article also mentioned him seeking a patent on a font
  he used in the self-promo piece being discussed.\r\n\r\nI've emailed Mr. Lund and
  also done a preliminary search on Lintotype for his name with no results.\r\n\r\nMy
  question to all of you, have you ever seen/used/purchased and typefaces created
  by Jon C. Lund? If so, where? If he has a line of typefaces for sale I would really
  love the opportunity to buy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arctique_3666.jpg]"
