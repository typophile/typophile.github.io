  to to do a research on the font \"Helvetica\". I have seen the movie \"helvetica\".\r\nSo,
  if anyone have any interesting facts on the font and its history, it will be a valuable
  information for me.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: Well, Arial is like Microsoft's rip-off version of Helvetica, which has risen
    to about the same level as popularity, but is used for good reason in web design,
    because it is one of the most widely recognized fonts on any computer.

  body: "Don't use Arial just because it is popular (this isn't actually true for
    the most part - it is a \"default\") and recognizable (Actually I doubt it is
    recognized by anyone other than typographers), actually that would be a very bad
    design decision.\r\n\r\nThere are many resources available for finding out information
    about [[Helvetica]] online, and many more in books. You might consider actually
    using the face so that you can include an informed opinion about how well it works
    or doesn't work for you.\r\n\r\nStart here: \r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/13514?\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica\r\n\r\nThen
    consult your local library or bookshop."
