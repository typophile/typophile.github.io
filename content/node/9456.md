body: I noticed House Industries representing at the Academy awards. Also they chose
  Helvetica for the 77 which is an interesting choice. Was anyone else as dorky as
  I noticing type when I should have been chillin&#39;?  <BR> <BR>I also noticed way
  too much use of Beyonce but that is discussion entirely.

    a word, &#40;i&#39;m french canadian&#41; they could have called someone who spoke
    french at least &#40;everyone except Celine Dion&#41; ... ok moving on, <BR> <BR>i
    noticed the increadibly ugly type logo for the Aviator ... why didn&#39;t they
    use the one on the poster instead ?? <a href="http://theaviatormovie.com/" target="_blank">http://theaviatormovie.com/</a>

  body: They used my <a href="http://www.marksimonson.com/article/117/mostra" target="_blank">Mostra
    Bold</a> for most of the titles that were displayed on the floor of the stage.
    I was pretty happy to see that. It&#39;s the first time it&#39;s been used so
    prominently that I know of. Strangely, a few of them were displayed in Helvetica
    and a light weight of Neutraface, for no apparent reason.  <BR> <BR>Neutraface
    Condensed was used for most of the superimposed titles and such.  <BR> <BR>Typographically,
    the show was rather uneven. They even used one of House&#39;s Spaceage fonts on
    a couple of animated titles.  <BR> <BR>Still, I&#39;m not going to complain. I
    estimate that Mostra was on screen for nearly two minutes total. Can&#39;t beat
    that.

    of the titling. I don&#39;t have any examples...

  body: Hey congratulations Mark. Must have been a thrill to have seen this! Looks
    like you and House were the big winners of the evening.  <BR> <BR>And yes, Hrant,
    this should have been the only good reason to watch this. Like Chris Rock said,
    its an event which the poor folks watch the rich get richer.

    ago, and it was nice seeing your beautiful typefaces in print.  And the CD came
    with Mostra regular as an added bonus!  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I think I know where that&#39;s coming from, although of course it&#39;s very
    hard to tell when it comes to such primitive communicators. More venting than
    communicating, really. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>When it comes to good fonts from bad
    people &#40;or at least people who turn me off, even if they&#39;re not necessarily
    bad people - at least not all of them, all the time&#41;, I try to be objective
    and admit that the fonts are good; but I won&#39;t go out of my way to praise
    their work, and I might spend a bit more energy pointing out problems. However,
    when it comes to good fonts from good people &#40;like Mark&#41;, I can admit
    to being a bit too ebullient with praise sometimes, and downplaying any negative
    aspects. It&#39;s sort of my personal reward mechanism, I guess - since we&#39;re
    all individuals who contribute positive/negative things to this society of ours.
