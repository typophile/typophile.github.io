  use as a companion for Minion Pro (among other things), mainly for publications
  about linguistics. Apart from basic and extended Latin character set I also need
  Cyrillic and Greek, which limits the possibilities substantially. I am a big fan
  of [[http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_product.ep?id=13665|Scala Sans]] (I know,
  it would be just imitating Bringhurst, but it really is a great font). Scala Sans
  doesn't include neither Cyrillic nor Greek, however.\r\nRight now my favourite choice
  is [[http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_product.ep?id=10110|Kievit Pro]] (I wouldn't
  know whether to pick [[http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_product.ep?id=10994|Regular]]
  or [[http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_product.ep?id=11011|Book]] as my point of
  departure, though).\r\nAnother option is [[http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-84-anselm-sans-pro|Stormtype
  Anselm Sans Pro]].\r\nBringhurst recommends Syntax with Minion - but as far as I
  can see, the Cyrillic version of Syntax, [[http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Humanist-531.htm|Paratype
  Humanist 531]], does not include an italic, which is crucial to my needs. And I
  don't know if there is a Greek version.\r\nSuggestions are welcome!\r\nCheers,\r\nThomas"

    Grotesk also includes Greek and Cyrillic.

    small caps, though - it's not that I <em>have</em> to have small caps, it's just
    nice to have the possibility.\r\nJessi, I wasn't able to find a Greek version
    of URW Grotesk. Where did you see that? It's really a very nice typeface. Do you
    think it goes well with Minion?\r\nJames, thanks for drawing my attention to FF
    Meta. Like Kievit, Meta even seems to have Greek and Cyrillic small caps. But
    again, how would Meta go with Minion?\r\n(I see that Syntax isn't as popular as
    it used to be, but I incidentally noticed that Linotype Syntax Com includes both
    Cyrillic and Greek versions, with italics.)\r\nThanks a lot for your input!\r\nCheers,\r\nThomas"

  body: This might sound horrid. Especially coming from such a pedantic purist as
    myself. But, I have used Myriad as small caps. If you have the semi-extended variant
    of the family you can get away with scaling them ever-so-much, spacing them a
    hair, and squooshing them just a tittle. It works when you need the "look" of
    small caps and want to use Myriad.

    link!\r\nAs for the home-made small caps of Myriad, it sounds like a funny idea.
    I will try and see how it looks. But I don't think I have the typographical self-confidence
    to make a real publication with that kind of small caps.\r\nThomas"

    grotesk is the font our organization is tied to, so I have used minion as well

    discussions forum.\r\n\r\nI am questioning because I have heard the name Akzidenz
    Grotesk a lot more that URW Grotesk, but same there, you don't have the Greek.

    I am looking for is Scala Sans with Cyrillic and Greek, which unfortunately doesn't

    I think it's going to be far too expensive for me (I'm just a poor academic who

    thank you for the suggestion. I am wholly dependent on Minion, but for the record
    it is good to notice that the Fedra family covers both Cyrillic and Greek.\r\nBy
    the way, I noticed that in [[http://www.aronov-books.ru/typo_1.html|the Russian
    translation of <em>Elements</em>]], Bringhurst uses Charter and Humanist 531 (Paratypes's
    version of Syntax). Interesting why he didn't use Minion as the serif font for
    that version of the book.\r\nThomas"
