body: "I am trying to name my boat after this beer and I would really like to be able
  to identify the font so that I can get it as close as possible.  The beer is called
  simpler times.  They sell it at trader joes.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

  body: Two different <strong>i</strong>'s, two different <strong>m</strong>'s, two
    different <strong>e</strong>'s . . . that's handlettering, mate. Why don't you
    blow up your JPG to the size you want and trace it onto your boat? But wait until
    after you're finished painting to drink the beer.
