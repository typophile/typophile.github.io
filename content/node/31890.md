    a higher-resolution copy of the Kraft logo.\r\n\r\nI can't find a close match.
    Best I can do are <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/laudatio-be/bold/\">Laudatio
    Bold</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/john-sans/heavy-black/\">John

    sample Spire posted. Ok, so I will say if that's the 'new' Kraft, all they would
    have needed to do is barely move the single corner endpoints of the Futura Bold+
    in outline form. It would be easy in a font program.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    eh?\r\n\r\nIKEA logo also has them.\r\n\r\nI think they keep the logo sharp at
    the points when it's printed small.\r\n\r\nWikipedia says:\r\n\r\n\"Petit-serifs
    are small serifs, which are attached to regular sans-serif fonts. These are normally
    added to fonts from rival font foundries to give them a better appearance and
    to reward the people who added the petit-serifs.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone tell me what
    that means?\r\n\r\nShould it technically be petits-serifs? Anyone speak French?\r\n\r\nBack
    to the Kraft logo, I think the answer might be <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/antique-olive/black/\">Antique
    Olive Black</a> with petit(s)-serifs."
