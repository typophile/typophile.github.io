  body: Christian Schwartz' Giorgio Sans (with the alternates) is in the same style,

  body: My [[http://www.frodehelland.com/?page=noir|Noir]] has a dramatic contrast
    between wide and narrow shapes (the former a product of geometry) in the capitals,
    but not too this extent. The sample on my website doesn't have that many capitals
    at the moment though.
