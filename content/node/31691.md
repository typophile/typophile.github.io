  body: Sounds like someone has customized <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=TheSans">TheSans</a>
    and edited it with their corporate name. This is very common for large business
    font licenses. Do you work for ATG or will the retail version of TheSans do?
