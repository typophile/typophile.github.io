  \"What Type are you?\"]] game, and hey I\u2019m Plastica! But I\u2019ve never heared
  of this typeface before ... The look is very close to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/umbra/regular/characters.html|Umbra]],
  but it\u2019s not the same (see especially M and J). I couldn\u2019t find a digital
  Plastica nor much information about the Designer Herbert Post. I just wonder if
  anyone has some deeper information about it ... Where does the Pentagram people
  find it?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plastica_5144.jpg] Best, Viktor"

    as well, though the hot-metal version looks quite different.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/umbra_5248.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    can't find Plastica in any stuff I have about Post."

  body: "While Gill Sans Light Shadowed is indeed very similar, it\u2019s not identical
    \u2013 see especially J, R, Z.\r\nMaybe Pentagram has made this typeface up? To
    me, it looks like they modified Umbra (Futura Shadowed) and/or Gill, made it look
    like a kind of Neuzeit Grotesk Shadowed and gave it the name of the stylistically
    related \u2013 and forgotten \u2013 Berthold face that Indra has shown. While
    it is not out of the question that Herbert Post has designed such a typeface,
    it would surprise me \u2013 in consideration of his work as far as I know it."

  body: "Ok, there are slight differences, but it's much closer than the Umbra sample
    that kupfers posted. BTW, I see no R in Viktor's photo.\r\n\r\nPS: Just looked
    up my copy of Umbra BT which looks more like Viktor's sample than what kupfers
    posted. Only J and M are different (smaller details in other letters aside).\r\nAndreas"

    haven't found anything, not one picture of Plastica \u2013 no idea how it looks
    like. \r\nAnd actually I also doubt that Post designed Plastica or Umbra. Those
    two are not attribute to a special designer in Berthold\u2019s records.\r\n\r\n((Hei
    Henning, can you have a look in your Berthold Hauptproben?))"
