  body: I think this is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times/bold/testdrive.html"
    target="_blank">Times  Bold</a> &#40;not Times New Roman, which is more compact&#41;.
    However, there are many Times versions, and I am not sure I have seen them all.
    <BR> <BR>I think this is at least very close.

  body: Are you sure Mike ? <BR>The &#34;g&#34; doesn&#39;t seem to be a Times one.
    It seems to be closer to Storm&#39;s Tusar, but not it...Thanks anyway !

  body: The splayed serifs on the T are Caslon-ish, but I couldn&#39;t find one that
    matches.

  body: Looks like a Caslon to me too, the problem will be nailing  <BR>the correct
    digitization.

    target="_blank"> Caslon 3</a>, because of that &#34;g&#34;.
