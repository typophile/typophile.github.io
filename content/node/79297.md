  would have felt a mild sense of irony to see a typeface of his, ''Perpetua ( Italic)'',
  used on the current Prince of Wales''s wedding invitation. Of course, ''Perpetua'',
  at eighty-two years old now, is a classic and represents the best of English design.
  It has that cunning simplicity that is the essence of elegance and never goes out
  of style. '

    mind that socialists must work for filthy lucre in order to support themselves
    in capitalist countries, which is frequently pointed out by their detractors as
    a mark of hypocrisy, the greater irony is that robber barons who \"give back\"
    to the communities which have generously provided their great wealth are considered
    philanthropists."

    an invitation which deserved to be printed from a hand-engraved die, it would
    be these!

  body: jacobh, I think the idea was that since the economy is in such dire straits
    then Prince William's wedding invitations mustn't be too over the top ... not
    only are they not over the top, they're actually quite shit.

  body: Nope. Sexual assault is a very serious crime. It overshadows everything else
    a person can ever do. After all, look at Leni Rifenstahl - and it's not as if
    her personal crimes were of the magnitude of those of Ilse Koch. Eric Gill doesn't
    even have that defense, so his ignominy should be worse than that of Leni Rifenstahl.

  body: Didn't know this about Gill's sordid personal life, the dog either. It wouldn't
    be the first instance of pristine forms in art, such as in 'Perpetua', emerging
    from a morally mucky source, but it always seems to come as a surprise.

  body: "@Nick Shinn:\r\n<cite>So what are you saying\u2014that people who use Gill
    Sans or Perpetua are condoning sexual assault?</cite>\r\nNo. I don't think that
    this issue can be simplified to that extent.\r\nIt's a reasonable attitude to
    take that Gill Sans and Perpetua are in themselves useful things which we should
    not deny ourselves because of whatever their creator may have done.\r\nBut it's
    also a reasonable attitude, which should not be condemned as bigoted, to shun
    those faces as an expression of our revulsion towards sexual assault.\r\nWhat
    I reject in this kind of situation is an insistence on ideological purity. In
    cinema, Leni Rifenstahl is a pariah, while Sergei Eisenstein is a hero. And yet
    Stalin killed even more people than Hitler. If these are the results of a consensus
    on which artists should be shunned produce, they are not results of value: hypocrisy
    is not valuable.\r\nWorks of art are valuable and useful things, and serious crimes
    shouldn't meet with indifference. These are both reasonable values - and individuals
    should be able to balance them in their own way. Free from both an insistence
    that everyone must stop using Gill Sans and Perpetua or be branded a pedophile
    sympathizer... and an equally ideological insistence that art is sacred and must
    be considered in isolation from the \"personal\" lives of its creators."

  body: "I just bought an Eric Gill book, published by the British Library. Not a
    very special thing in itself but it will save me searching for references in future.
    I did think twice but on balance I bought it anyway.\r\n\r\nWhat is the origin
    of the revelations about Gill? I've no reason to doubt them, I'm just aware I
    couldn't provide more than a rumour myself.\r\n\r\nQuadibloc, what was Eisenstein's
    relationship to Stalin? I would guess not quite so close as Rifenstahl/Hitler\u2026
    ?"

  body: '1985: I think the first book to explore these issues was Fiona MacCarthy''s
    biography (called simply "Eric Gill") which was published by Faber and Faber.
    You can still get the paperback version quite easily and cheaply online. Many
    of the improprieties, if I remember correctly, stem--in a somewhat Gladstonian
    way--from Gill''s own diaries, so I don''t think there is much room to doubt them.'
