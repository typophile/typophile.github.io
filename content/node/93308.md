    refering to your usual cryptic mode, I\u2019m not getting smarter. There is nothing,
    as far as I can tell, that relates to my question in that post of yours. I am
    not asking about delta hints, I am asking about links: my hyphen jumps from one
    to two pixels and back again at random, seemingly disregarding the control value
    table. It is not a case of CVT cut-in (Fontlab equivalent) neither."

    If I size something to a fractional pixel size it goes crazy in Windows. Any idea

    you doing this?

  body: "FF>\"I mean px size in CSS.\"\r\n\r\nYou mean fractional px sizes in CSS?\r\n\r\nI
    see documentation for spaces but not type sizes. But... I'm fairly certain that
    if the web designer can and does specify fractional px sizes for fonts, that all
    instructions should turn off. \r\n\r\nDoes your instructed hyphen behave \"normally\",
    i.e. jump from 1 to 2 to 3 pixels thick smoothly at whole point sizes?\r\n\r\nYes,
    I am thinking of your process. "

  body: GDI rounds fractional sizes to full pixels right? How does this affect the
    hinting? If it does at all? I am reluctant to believe otherwise, as I've seen
    similar issues before corrected by specifying the font size in full pixels.

    don\u2019t know the exact sizes. These are steps on a slider, and my Firebug plugin
    returns a full pixel size, which I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not. The hyphen
    differs from the other letters in that it only uses a double link. \r\n\r\nI did
    generate these files with Fontsquirrel\u2019s generator. It has an option of auto
    adding hyphens. I\u2019ve double checked that it was turned off, so I don\u2019t
    think that\u2019s it neither. It would also be wierd for it to override the hyphen
    that is already in the font.\r\n"

    that didn\u2019t help. In the end I tested raw files (thanks Karsten), and also
    a different font (both raw and Fontsquirrel-generated) and it turns out the problem
    lies with Fontsquirrel.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not exactly sure what it is though. For
    example, my accented a\u2019s all render differently than their base glyph.\r\n\r\n(It
    should be mentioned they have a y-direction double link to control the distance
    to diacritica. The base glyph a is locked to alignment zones, but none of the
    diacritis are.)"

  body: Something of a shot in the dark but try moving the hyphen vertically (either
    up or down) a little bit. My guess would be because it is directly between two
    horizontal rows on the pixel grid, slight variations in rendering and sizing could
    lead to this sort of outcome.
