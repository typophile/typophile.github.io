  body: More hand lettering than type but still some really cool stuff. Funny how
    there seem to be more beauty salons than anything else. I guess vanity is not
    a problem solely in the U.S.

    shop - I hear its poor, but I''d still love to get hold of a DVD if its available

  body: sii, I must confess that I've never watched an episode but am aware of the
    show you're referring to. The SABC doesn't usually release their shows to DVD
    because there isn't really ever enough demand but I'll keep an eye out if you
    like...
