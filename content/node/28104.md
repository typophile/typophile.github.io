  not quite Rockwell, not quite Geometric SlabSerif, and not quite Memphis, but close
  to all. Can anyone nail it?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/notrockwell_3797.jpg]"

  body: 'Thanks everyone. Lubalin Graph is definitely right. My apologies about the
    CMYK thing: I just attached the sample that was sent to me without checking it.'

  body: Don't worry about that. I mentionned it primarily for you because it sometimes
