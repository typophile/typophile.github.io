  body: "A little Googling:\r\n\r\n<strong>The United States Abbreviation Theory</strong>\r\n\r\nOne
    of the most popular theories is that the dollar sign is derived from the initials
    of the United States. If you superimpose a capital \"U\" on a capital \"S\" then
    drop the lower part of the \"U\", what you end up with is a version of the dollar
    symbol with two strokes. This theory was endorsed by the American libertarian
    philosopher and staunch defender of capitalism, Ayn Rand, in her novel Atlas Shrugged.
    Chapter 10 is entitled the Sign of the Dollar. Rand claimed the dollar sign was
    the symbol not only of the currency, but also the nation, a free economy, and
    a free mind.\r\n\r\n<strong>Origin of the Euro:</strong>\r\n\r\nArthur Eisenmenger
    designed the \u20AC as a generic symbol of Europe years before the new currency
    was mooted. 'I drew it without much consideration,' he said in an interview some
    years ago. 'I wasn't thinking of the Euro at the time, but just something that
    symbolized Europe.' \r\n\r\nSo my guess would be they chose the Latin R for Russia,
    not Ruble, and that the symbol should represent Russia more than just a simple
    mark representing the type of currency."
