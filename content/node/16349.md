  body: "By the way, a 'track' on you shows that you have a lot of Type ID requests.\r\nNevertheless,
    you never seem to get this right:\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"http://typophile.com/forums/typeid/faq/#Q_2\">What
    do I enter in the \u201CTitle\u201D line?</a>\r\nTry to define your type ID request
    as clearly as possible. For example \u201C1960\u2019s newspaper headline face\u201D
    or \u201CLost in Translation movie logo\u201D or \u201Cretro script\u201D will
    do nicely. Whereas <strong>\u201CPlease help me identify this font\u201D is pretty
    pointless</strong> as that\u2019s the only thing we do on the Type Identification
    Board. Compare it to a newspaper where every single headline would say \u201CStuff
    happened!\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nCan you try to make a better effort next time, or
    is it asking too much? :^/"
