  body: "\"Fleur\" may be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-champion-script-pro/regular/|Champion
    Script]], but the glyph set is impossible to see at MyFonts. There is a strong
    similarity in the lines of the F, but the actual connections of elements is not
    the same. Is this an alternate F? Who can see? The font has over 4000 glyphs.\r\n\r\nIt
    also resembles Bickham Script, but not identical to the fancy F in that font,
    so I eliminated that idea, even though the rest of the letters seem similar to
    Bickham alternates.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
