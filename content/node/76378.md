  body: ugf it's horrid. I do appreciate that devices need to be accommodated for,
    but this is an extreme level I for one ain't going to. Interesting post!

  body: A shorter column width at least would help. I can read the letters but can't
    keep track of which line I'm on.

    I'll gladly stop reading immediately ;)\r\n\r\nWhy do people suppose other people
    suppose the smallest possible bit map font is interesting to anyone? I mean tiny
    text is useless for any non-legal application if not beyond legible and into readable,
    ain't it?\r\n\r\nThe only imaginable motive I can come up with is some ingrained
    Fabrege complex."

  body: I can read it. One more vertical pixel should be sacrificed for descenders
    and commas. Descenders touching the following line is better than no descenders
    at all.
