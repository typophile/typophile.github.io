body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for an elegant stencil font for a logo. I want a
  stencil font because I like the industrial/handmade feeling it conveys, but at the
  same time, I don't want it to be too cold. It should be somewhat *a bit* warm and
  elegant. Yeah, I know that's pretty much opposites. I know I could design it myself,
  but I've never designed fonts and I'm afraid it would look cheap compared to professional
  type designers' fonts. If a font like that exists somewhere, I am willing to try
  it !\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your suggestions."

    thought of this thread - so I decided to revive it. Though this is not my choice
    for \"elegant\" stencil fonts -- I had to share because it was a nice assortment
    and you can't beat \"free.\"\r\n\r\nPersonal choice for an \"elegant stencil\"
    would be Glaser Stencil - however, seeing that this thread originated in June
    of 2006, I think it would be safe to assume that eclectic's search is over...\r\n\r\nBTW
    - does elegant and stencil actual go together?\r\n\r\nP.S. Patty, I see you are
    also a fan of Glaser. My all time favorite stencil - and I try to sneak it in
    on jobs is House Industries Flyerfont-Reject... it's just, well, adorable!"
