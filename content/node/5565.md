  I&#39;ve done a Google search just to find a sample to no avail. Any ideas?

    at it. Hand-drawn, obviously, but I&#39;m guessing you want to know what inspired
    it. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40329.jpg"

  body: By the way, that version of Parsons I linked to is not a very good version
    of Parsons, but the only digital one I could find. Also, it lacks the alternate
    G that is used on the Gracie Films logo. You can see better versions of this face
    in older type books.

  body: '<a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/index.htm"
    target="_blank"> Dieter Steffmann</a> digitized a set of 3 Parsons Bold fonts
    under the name Puritan. The set contains the base font as well as an Alternates
    and a Swash variant. None of these include the G in the Gracie image, but Puritan
    Regular contains that M, which the Alphabets version doesn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>Herr
    Steffmann digitized Parsons Heavy and, for some reason, allowed it to keep its
    name. This also includes an Alternates font. <BR> <BR>Finally, for completeness
    sake, there&#39;s an old Compuworks font called <a href="http://www.grsites.com/modperl/fontview.cgi?dir=c&amp;fn=CW_CHRCH"
    target="_blank"> Churchman</a>. This is Parsons Light. <BR> <BR>None of these
    fonts are terribly well made and the Compuworks font is missing some punctuation
    and all extended characters. They all look lousy on screen at even medium small
    sizes. <BR> <BR>I know how you all drool over Swash fonts, so here&#39;s Puritan

  body: Stephen, I knew about Persons but hadn&#39;t looked at it. I think that must
    be what they used. I just checked an old BB&amp;S catalog and McGrew, both of
    which show the original metal version. Parsons looks just as funky in metal as
    all the digital versions mentioned so far. Only Persons has the simpler G, as
    in the Gracie logo.  <BR> <BR>Huh! Two Phil Martin faces in one day.

    three of Phil&#39;s distributors and none of them have Persons.

  body: I think only about half of Phil Martin&#39;s fonts are available in digital
    format, and many of those are incomplete &#40;basic character set only--no alternates,
    ligatures or swash characters&#41;. Persons is among the undigitized. Several
    parties are at work rectifying this situation, but it takes time.
