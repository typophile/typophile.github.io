  needs to purchase fonts that were used by the previous publisher. <BR>&#40;And I&#39;m
  not sure if just buying the family would include everything I need?&#41; <BR> <BR>The
  list he needs is: <BR> <BR>Fenice BT <BR>Fenice BD BT <BR>Fenice LT BT <BR>Fenice
  LT IT BT <BR>Fenice Regular <BR> <BR>Futura Condensed Extra Bold <BR>Futura Extra
  Bold <BR>Futura <BR>Fututa Light <BR> <BR>News Gothic BT <BR>News Gothic BD BT <BR>
  <BR>For starters, what do: <BR> <BR>BT <BR>BD BT <BR>LT BT <BR>LT IT BT <BR> <BR>abbreviations
  stand for? I&#39;m guessing LT = Light and BD = Bold, but am lost on BT. <BR> <BR>The
  three font families have other references I&#39;m not familiar with. For example,
  there is ITE Fenice and Fenice CE. <BR> <BR>Where would be the best place to buy
  these fonts from? <BR>A lot of the sites seem to be geared to consumers rather than
  commercial users. <BR> <BR>Thanks everyone!'

    Linotype</a> Well, in your example, LT seems &#34;Light&#34; weight <BR>IT= Italic?
    International Typeface &#40;Corp.&#41;? <BR>CE= Central Europe &#40;special characters,

  body: Charles, look to the Open Type format for as many fonts as you have. They
    have the most glyphs and are the most versitle. You might visit the Adobe site
    which has alot of Open Type fonts.

  body: Thanks Daniel, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working in Quark 4 at the moment &#40;imac
    G5 1.6ghz running OSX 10.3.7 with no dual boot&#41; but hope to go InDesign CS
    in a few months. <BR>If I buy OpenType now, can I still use them in Quark 4 in
    classic mode?

  body: You can buy all of these fonts directly from Bitstream, or from MyFonts.com.
    If you just want these weights, you&#39;ll probably have to buy each one individually.
    <BR> <BR>LT usually means Linotype, but here it definitely means Lights. IT is
    Italic &#40;the International Typeface Corporation&#39;s abreviation is ITC and
    not IT&#41;. BD is bold, and I haven&#39;t a devil what ITE is. But check on MyFonts,
    you&#39;ll probably find it there.

  body: I suspect ITE Fenice is simply a typo for ITC Fenice. A problem with the list
    is that AFAIK, Fenice doesn&#39;t have an italic, only an oblique.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    surprised that Dan didn&#39;t say it, but you can in fact buy all of these fonts
    from Linotype.

  body: Yes Steve, how true! I suspect that most of the fonts can be had from Monotype
    and FontShop as well. Normally, I do recommend people to the Linotype website.
    In this case, I didn&#39;t because Bitstream &#40;BT&#41; digitalizations seemed
    to be needed. I think that our fonts look better than Bitstream&#39;s, and have
    no idea if Bitstream has added Euros to all of their fonts, but if he needed Bitstream
    fonts to work in an all Bitstream environment, I wouldn&#39;t wanto to mess with
    his documents word flow or compatability issues. For the record though, if these
    aren&#39;t required issues, you should try shopping over at <a href="http://www.linotype.com"

    you over the phone if you&#39;d like.

    <BR>Yes, they&#39;ll work just like any Type 1 font but you won&#39;t be able  <BR>to
    access OT features or OT &#40;extra&#41; glyphs. But this point might <BR>be moot
    since I don&#39;t believe any of the fonts you&#39;re seeking are <BR>available
    with said glyphs and features.

    confusion about the series of abbreviations reminded me to ask:\r\nWhat does \"MT\"
    stand for? as in \"Albertina MT\" or \"Gill Sans MT\". Is this shorthand for Monotype,
    or some other secret code describing an aspect of the style/design?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
