body: Need some help identifying the blackletter face in this logo. Tried going through
  MyFonts, looking through their blackletter category, but they all started to blur
  together near the end of the day. Please help![img:sites/default/files/old-images/help_3980.jpg]

  body: Almost certainly custom, so no font will match exactly. It's a typical newspaper
    nameplate textura (I've been looking at a ton lately for a project). You could
    try [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-goudy-text/|LTC Goudy Text]] or
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/wedding-text/|Wedding Text]] to come
    close, but the only way to have an exact replica is to do it yourself (or get
    the actual EPS from someone at the Inquirer).
