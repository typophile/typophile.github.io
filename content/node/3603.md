  body: You&#39;re right that the MLB logos are custom. Some were designed by artists
    long before digital fonts; some were designed my digital font designers for the
    Leagues or Teams, but the safe assumption is that few of them are going to be
    found in actual fonts, although sometimes you might find something close &#40;Like
    using <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=Quentin" target="_blank">Quentin</a>,
    or a similar font for the Red Sox&#41;. <BR> <BR>We have talked about having an
    FAQ for this, since we get so many questions about commercial and Sports logos,
    and almost all of them are custom artwork or custom fonts in order to increase
    the exclusive marketing potential and/or identity aspect of the logo. <BR> <BR>If
    anyone could easily duplicate any look, the Sports teams would lose millions in
    souvenir sales and corporations would be suing people for trademark infringement
    &#40;which does happen anyway&#41;.

  body: Peter,  <BR> <BR>The FAQ was supposed to let people know that in general logos
    for corporations and sports teams, and trademarks for major products  are usually
    all custom work that will not be fonts you can buy. <BR> <BR>Sure, I know there
    are a few exceptions, but maybe it would save us from repeating this 8 times a
    day.  <BR> <BR>It will never fly, so it doesn&#39;t matter...
