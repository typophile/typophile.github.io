  twice or more. You can see from the posting time that they where simultaneous. There
  was a Type ID thread today that had been duplicated about eight times. \r\n\r\nIt
  has only happened to me once and as far as I recall, my post was taking a very long
  time to be saved. It is possible that I clicked the \"save\" button a second time
  since nothing appeared to be happening properly after I'd clicked it the first time.
  I only use Firefox but cannot remember if it was my old Mac G4 running OSX 10.4.11
  at home, or either the Windows 7 or Vista PCs at work.\r\n\r\nIf this is already
  being discussed in this section of the forum please can someone direct me to that
  thread. Thanks."
