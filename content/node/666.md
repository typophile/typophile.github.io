body: 'For those interested, my good friend Justin Bakse has just released a handy
  application named Ligature Counter. In short, you can paste text into the application
  and get results for both letter frequency and letter combo frequency. Very nice
  for analyzing text, thinking about frequent letterforms or working out some new
  ligatures. The application is free and web based. <BR>Take it for a spin here: <BR><a

  <BR> <BR> <BR>Many thanks to Justin for making this for me &#40;and then making
  it free for everyone&#41; and Hrant for planting the initial idea in my head for
  such a thing. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Eric O.'

    tried one with about 10K words&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks Justin and Eric! <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: This is a very handy little thing. Thank you. Is there any chance of modifying
    it to analyse Unicode text? I have extensive corpi of ancient Greek and Biblical
    Hebrew, and would love to develop some frequency data. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s something
    derived from the current implementation that might be useful for people want to
    compare the relative space efficiency of different fonts. The string of letters
    below represents the frequency of each in English as sampled from a text of 34,643
    words &#40;most of the books of Genesis, Exodus and Numbers in the New International
    Version &#40;UK spelling&#41;&#41;. I also sampled from shorter versions of the
    text to confirm that the frequency was similar or identical in texts of any significant
    length &#40;10,000&#43; words&#41;. The benefit of comparing fonts using this
    string, rather than simply comparing alphabet length, should be obvious. <BR>
    <BR>Below the string are the relative letter frequencies &#40;actual number of
    occurences in the sampled text divided by 100 and rounded to the nearest whole
    number &#40;except q, which is rounded up to 1 from .3&#41;&#41;. Remove line
    breaks for best results after pasting into your app of choice. <BR> <BR>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

  body: Yeah, there could be a number of improvements to Justin&#39;s great script,
    including Unicode &#40;or at least Upper-ASCII support&#41;, but also the ability
    to load the sample text and save out the results. Let&#39;s motivate him!  :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>&#62; useful for people want to compare the relative <BR>&#62; space
    efficiency of different fonts <BR> <BR>That&#39;s a nice trick! You can also do
    this by having a straight string of the 26 letters where each is scaled horizontally
    by its [relative] frequency. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
