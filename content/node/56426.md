    Serif]]. Note the serifs on the S in particular. It's almost like this is a custom
    version of Fiona Serif, if I had to guess.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks, slokai. Catalog is the typeface I was looking for. (Binnenland should
    do something about the search (and bookmark-ability) of their site. Couldn't find
    it though I knew the name.)\r\n\r\nJan, you are right. Sorry for the confusion.
    I came across this book in the bookshop and only had a brief look, coming back
    home I seemed to remember it as a slab. Wasn't even sure the cover was set in
    the same typeface, but now I see that's the case.\r\n\r\nThanks for the other
    suggestions of similar typefaces.\r\n\r\n/Fredrik"
