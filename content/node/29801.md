  from the <a href=\"http://www.tdc.org/reviews/typelist.html\">TDC list of '100 Top
  Types of all Time?'</a> I am looking for foundry specimen sheets and covers, promotional
  material, scans, .jpeg files of examples in use of the following sixteen (in no
  particular order); these are the ones that have fallen through the cracks in my
  research to date...\r\n\r\nUnger Fraktur, Lucida, Bauer Bodoni, Fette Fraktur, ITC
  Garamond, OCR-A, Peter Jessenschrift, Bitstream Charter, Adobe Poetica, ITC Marconi,
  FF Thesis, Apollo, ITC Flora, Digi-Grotesk S, Compacta.\r\n\r\nAccompanying information
  about image provenances and copyright permissions, as applicable, would be most
  welcome. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks Stephen. I got confused with the foundry appellation/abbreviation.
    'Font Fabriek' is what I meant. Sorry.

    a TDC member I think) should be able to give you something better.\r\n\r\n> Bauer

  body: "Thanks Hrant. I know (and can access) the book you mention; you're right
    of course, there is an Unger Fraktur sample in it. And Peter Bain has kindly supplied
    some material for another face in the list, but I didn't think to ask him twice.\r\n\r\nMetal
    reference for Bauer Bodoni would be fantabulous! \r\n\r\nIf you have it...\r\n\r\nIn
    fact, the more I get into this, the more metal type ( and the specimens thereof)
    become paramount as the authoritative reference."

    to Neufville in person, so I assume this sample is not via a mailing list.

    and visited Neufville to discuss Pascal. I was kindly given a tour of the foundry
    (and I do mean foundry - among other things I saw a casting machine spitting out
    sorts), was given a copy of that Bauer catalog, and even got to enjoy some seaside
    paella with Wolfgang Hartmann - a continental gentleman if there ever was one.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    for examples of\r\n\r\nUnger Fraktur, Lucida, Fette Fraktur, OCR-A, Peter Jessenschrift,
    ITC Marconi, Apollo, ITC Flora, Digi-Grotesk S.\r\n\r\nC'mon guys and gals! Surely
    you have some (fabulously yellowed) reference for some of these? Or tell me where
    to look?"

  body: "Ben, it turns out that the glorious 1908 Enschede specimen book shows a large
    complement of fraktur fonts cut by Unger (I'm guessing all of them). I don't know
    which one the TDC list is about, but I've taken a macro photo of the second-largest
    size for you. Below is a 25% version - and I'll email you the full one in a minute.
    BTW, \"gros parangon\" is about 22pt.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UngerFraktur-s_4249.jpg]\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks again Hrant. You really <strong>have</strong> saved me a lot of time
    rummaging through the library there. \r\n\r\nSuperscript characters that small
    and close would be for people who... er, pay attention.\r\n\r\nIn that the TDC
    list is talking about the typefaces that represent salient technical or artistic
    development, I think the Unger Fraktur referred to is the 1793 design that attempted
    to match fraktur for Didot's 'antiqua' proportions. \r\n\r\nSo the list of examples-to-be-sourced
    is now looking like\r\n\r\nLucida, Fette Fraktur, Peter Jessenschrift, ITC Marconi,
    Apollo, ITC Flora, Digi-Grotesk S.\r\n\r\nTIA for any contributions!\r\n"
