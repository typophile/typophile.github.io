  am in the grateful position that I can let others speak about my typeface and let
  it shine out of itself:\r\n\r\n\u201C[...] Skyhook Mono is quite possibly the most
  flexible monospaced font in years. It includes dozens of features you wouldn\u2019t
  expect in a modern and ultra-simplified design: case-sensitive forms, true italics,
  both old style and lining numerals, fractions, titling forms, arrows, both decorative
  uppercase and lowercase ligatures, multiple weights (which maintain the same metrics),
  a full Greek alphabet, and an enormous range of accented characters. At over 600
  glyphs per cut, it is perfectly suited for many of the tasks and involved projects
  that only the richest booktype families were capable of in the past.\r\n\r\nTry
  it out for yourself - currently, a free sample weight is available for download.\u201D\r\n\r\nSome
