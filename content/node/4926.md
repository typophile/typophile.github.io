body: Would anyone offer suggestions for a pro bono effort?  The project is a urban
  playground renovation 4 miles from downtown Atlanta.  The design used will capture
  attention throughout the city for fundraising and PR efforts.  All types media.  Calling
  all you creative geniuses.  You know who you are and I hope to see your stuff here.  Of
  course, credit when Fernbank Playground website is up<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    you are asking for.

  body: Ms. Now, <BR>That is an awful lot to ask of any logo.  A logo could &#40;in
    a small way&#41; be useful only to represent the effort as organized. Your best
    chance at getting donations is to get pictures and video of the kids who would
    be helped in front of the media as often as possible.  Perhaps a well taken photo
    of a representative group of kids there would be the best branding device you
    could use.

  body: 'Mr. Lozos, <BR>While your point is quite true, I invite you to look at our
    own collaborative board re: the DV/Deaf Logo effort.  Outstanding in every respect.  The
    artists truly captured the essence of the shelter.  All memorable works.  I thought
    it in the renovations best interests to offer the same impact opportunity T forums
    offer.  Surely that'

  body: 'I am not saying don&#39;t do a logo.  I am saying while the logo is in process,
    perhaps here is something that can be done quickly. I was just thinking out loud
    hoping to get a dialogue going that would bring ideas to the surface.  Maybe it&#39;s
    my socratic herritage. <BR>Do you have a name or slogan that gets to the meaning
    you are after? Here is a quick mind dump to help you think about it: <BR>Small
    Hands Need Big Help <BR>Help Kids Play it Safely <BR>Playground for Progress <BR>
    <BR>By the way, what is the name of the playground or project? If that is still
    open, you might want to use the name as a vehicle beyond just the name of the
    place. <BR>Again I am just blurting out stuff, please don&#39;t take offense.  <BR>
    <BR>Also, do you have a marketing plan?  Who is the target audience and what avenue
    is the best way to reach them?'

  body: The quick fix would be Kaboom! canned stuff.  I mentioned it lacks...something.  But
    it is slick and available.  So that would do for now.   The Fernbank area is an
    eclectic mix of internationals, blue bloods &#40;Driving Miss Daisy was shot here&#41;,
    academia &#40;Emory University&#41; and more.  A motley crew:-/  So how to appeal
    to the diverse yet small masses?   <BR> <BR>Save the Kids &#40;Whales&#41; <BR>We
    Need You &#40;Uncle Sam&#41; <BR>Just Help Us &#40;Nike&#41; <BR> <BR>You succinctly
    identified the first step of this journey.  Hooray for your Socratic heritage.  No
    offense taken, just reading too many old hhp threads.  The working name is Fernbank
    Playground Project.

  body: I must have misslead you.  What I meant by the audience was the people you
    are trying to get to contribute money to your cause, not the children who will
    use the playground.  The desired action here is getting contributions to the playground
    so the audience for your symbol is those who are the most likely to contribute.
    Does anyone you know have connections to your &#34;bluebloods&#34; social scene?  I&#39;m
    hoping for some groundwork networking to maybe make this a pet project of someone
    there.   <BR>The University may be able to supply young willing and caring students
    to help with the work and perhaps get their parents to contribute. <BR> <BR>What
    does the word &#34;Fernbank&#34; mean to the greater community there?  Does it
    carry any meaning other than a place? You may need something more telling in the
    name.
