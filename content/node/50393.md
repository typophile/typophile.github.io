  letter spread apart.\r\n\r\nBut the I is just incredibly, incredibly skinny all
  by its little lonesome self.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? I need an I with a line striking
  through the top and bottom. "

  body: One sans with a serifed "I" that comes to mind is Bell Gothic. There are plenty
    more, too...

  body: The skinny, lonesome, Helvetica "I," by the way, may get just cozy enough
    with a nice cup of custom kerning, rather than just relying on default letter-spacing
    algorithms. Good luck.
