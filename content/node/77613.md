  body: Yes I have one and i just used it the other day actually when I bought a new
    monitor. It calibrates very nicely and effortlessly. I was checking pantone colors
    to my screen and they were as close as a RGB monitor will produce compared to
    ink.

    difference between Pro and (un)Pro merely software or is there different hardware?"

    you only design for yourself.\r\nBut if you work in colour for others, good calibration
    is very important.\r\n\r\n(Fun is a boss who insists that the PDF proof of a 60
    page catalog is colour calibrated to look right on her crappy laptop screen before
    we go to print.)"
