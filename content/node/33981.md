  anybody have some information on this.\r\n\r\nSo far I have added:\r\n\r\n/Ezh/ezh/Ezhcaron/ezhcaron/Kcaron/kcaron/Gcaron/gcaron/Gbar/gbar/Hcaron/hcaron/\r\nHowever,
  I noticed on some existing fonts that sometimes the glyphs; /tonos/anoteleia/overscore
  also are there in the font files. Why is this and is it needed?\r\n\r\nAre there
  anything else importing that I should consider when adding this language support?\r\nAnybody?"

    font already. This Skolt sami is \"beyond\" the standard \u2018Pro\u2018 set.\r\n\r\nI
    was more thinking if someone has experience of the specific language."
