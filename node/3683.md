  body: You know, I had been looking at an ad for her new album and was thinking,
    &#34;Jeez, I hate her, but at least her designer didn&#39;t use a font for this.&#34;
    Got me on that one. I hadn&#39;t looked closely at the album title, which did
    have obviously repeating letters, but the designer did distress her name enough
    so that the letters didn&#39;t repeat exactly &#40;on the ad I have, which is
    a little different than the sample above&#41;. So I guess I&#39;ll give the designer
    moderate props for fooling me. That&#39;s what I think a designer should do with
    a handwriting font for a logo such as this. <BR> <BR>Good call, Yves.

  body: 'I really like the look of her new CD and even if it is a typeface, it doesn&#39;t
    appear to be used straight &#34;out of the can&#34; -- sort of a post-modern calendar
    girl look. '

    as a type designer.

  body: Escrita has a number of alternate characters that gives you even more range.
    That&#39;s why the &#39;e&#39; in the Test Drive was different from the sample.
    I have a showing with most of the various alternates in the Script Font ID Guide
    at <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script13Pg3.html" target="_blank">http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script13Pg3.html</a>

  body: Now if Courtney Love could only stay off the David Letterman show and keep
    her clothes on and stop assaulting fans she&#39;d be great. If you don&#39;t know
    what I&#39;m refering to see the New York Daily News or the New York Post online
    today. She is just a charmer.
