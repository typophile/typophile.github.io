body: Anyone an idea how to modify shapes using opentype syntax? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  thinking of drawing or modifying shapes that are placed on or around glyphs while
  being typed, or after each line ending. <BR>A few glyphs in the Unicode Private
  Area could be used as containers for the basic patterns then.  <BR>The thing I&#39;m
  really curious about is the application of multiple repetitions of these patterns
  on a singly glyph and along a line of type. <BR>So when the line is &#34;cast&#34;
  it would get &#34;messed up&#34; with the randomly applied &#34;shrapnel glyphs&#34;.

    that all of the OT people seem to watch most.
