    body: Thank you so much!  that's absolutely spot on!  I was completely confused
      because the logo uses Ubuntu which I knew and yet the characters are very different
      to the sample, so I didn't think that could be Ubuntu.  Thanks to you now, I
      have discovered that the logo is using Ubuntu-title which displays many characters
      completely differently!  Many thanks again.
