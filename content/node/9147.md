body: Double spacing, the bane of my existance. I am under the impression that it
  is a nasty hangover from the era of the typewriter, and all but banished from modern
  life. My girlfriend and I had a big conversation in the car the other day because
  I told her that &#34;no-one double spaces any more&#34;, but she was told that it
  is standard receptionist/secretary practice. So after unlearning to double space,
  she now has to relearn to double space, and is sceptical of any more typographical
  advice from me!  <BR> <BR>So, two q&#39;s. Why the heck did double spacing originate,
  and why do offices continue to do so?

  body: A somewhat related question. As some of you know I&#39;m a beginner at the
    whole type design thing. I&#39;ve been making punctuation marks &#40;.,;:!?&#41;
    with almost no left sidebearing and around 1/2 the width of the space character
    on the right. I then kern .&#34; etc. Is this a bad thing? I like space between
    words to be smaller than between punctuation and a word, but not double the space.
    Should the font not force this on the designer or is it OK to do this?

  body: Double spacing was used from the typewriter days when text was fixed spaced.
    Since the full stop &#40;period&#41; took the same space as a capital M it wasn&#39;t
    necessarily clear as to the end of a line. So too with a comma etc. Obviously
    now that typewriters are in the museum and most of us have left the world of DOS
    wordprocessors, ie all text is now proportionally spaced, then putting a double
    space after a full stop is no longer relevant.

  body: Kris, I too have had this conversation, even with my in-laws. It&#39;s still
    very common. I get documents with this aberration <i>contsantly</i>. It&#39;s
    taught by people who learned to type on a typewriter and are now teaching typing
    to kids. Also, anything that makes a paper for school look longer will never totally
    go out of fashion.
