  The closest I've gotten so far is Gill Sans Extra Bold for the \"Car of the Year\"
  text and Heldustry (not sure where I got it) for the Motor Trend font. But these
  are a bit off, so if you could provide any help it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TEMP-Image_1_4_5919.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  have a straight on picture of a very cracked decal I can put up if needed as well."

  body: Yep, Futura. Although the "9" in "1985" appears a little narrower than futura,
    and the bottom of it looks more like Avant Garde (hard to say with the blur, though)
