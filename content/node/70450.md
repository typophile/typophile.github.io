  body: "Here is the link for <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/tempus-sans-itc/\">Tempus
    Sans</a>. By the way, this was a new design in 1995, by Phill Grimshaw, where
    'vintage' usually means a 19th century design, and 'uncial' means all letters
    are the same size (unicase). This mixed case lettering is usually called \"Title
    case\", where the first letter of each word is capitalized. I am not trying to
    be a wise guy, I just thought you might like to learn the terminology for future
    posts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
