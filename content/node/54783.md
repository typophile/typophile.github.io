  when I jump in to my professional career but I'm not privy to much general discussion
  about text faces.. so I have some questions.\r\n\r\n1. good friendly text face\r\n\r\n2.
  what's the 'helvetica' of text faces? is there any single text face that you see
  everywhere??\r\n\r\n3. what about a sans??\r\n\r\n4. what's Jost Hochuli's 'Detail
  in Typography' set in?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "Since most people still choose a serif for text composition, the closest
    thing to a \"Helvetica of text faces\" is Times Roman. Times is a good, useful
    face that, like Helvetica, is now so ubiquitous in our visual environment it's
    practically invisible, and that's why you shouldn't make it your house text font.\r\nHow
    about [[http://www.linotype.com/112295/itcstone-clan.html?gclid=CKiM462_25gCFQG7GgodwX8tcw|ITC
    Stone]]? The serif is dignified but not boring, and is available with small caps,
    old style figures, etc. There's a handsome italic, and it comes in Semibold and
    Bold weights. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stoneserif_4382.JPG]\r\nThere's
    also a companion sans serif, which I like for text composition because it's not
    as rigidly geometric as many sans serifs. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stonesans_5704.JPG]\r\nAnd
    if you want to get extra-friendly, there's Stone Informal, distinguished by blunted
    serifs, less contrast between thick and thin strokes, and a cursive-style lowercase
    <strong>a</strong> and <strong>g</strong>, even in the Roman.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stoneinformal_5967.JPG]"

    Times particularly worked better in metal though, and in certain sizes. The many
    \"computer\" versions muddy the water.\r\n\r\nThe contemporary \"Times\" is, as
    Celeste says, Minion. It is common enough for text settings that designers mutter,
    \"I'm so tired of Minion.\" There is a reason they're tired of it; it works so
    well for so many things.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nBTW, I've been setting books for

    good typefaces. Personally, I <em>have</em> used them both for long stretches

  body: "Thanks for the responses guys! Okay so the best way to go forward from here:\r\n\r\nI
    asked what Detail In Typography was set in because I thought it looked really
    great, but what do I know and Mr. Shinn says I'll get pigeon holed and I definitely
    do not want that to happen.\r\n\r\n I have Adobe Minion Pro (probably came with
    CS3 or 4) so I can definitely afford that, ITC Stone looks pretty cool and I can
    buy the variations individually. \r\n\r\nI'm probably going to have to wait on
    FF Kievit or FF Milo, seems like a good thing to bill a client for..\r\n\r\nSo
    the question is: what's the best way to get my hands on the licenses to better
    text faces? buy em' now out of (mostly empty) pocket? or wait till I get a job
    where the client will need a good text face and get it that way?\r\n\r\nMr. Shinn:
    are there any text faces that you could suggest to possibly broaden my horizon?\r\n\r\n-

    Stone. It is nicely clean and open, but to me its ascenders are a bit too short

    dull, as Walter Tracy says is a danger with short ascenders (for lengthy text).

  body: "A note on ITC Stone & Sumner Stone's fonts generally:\r\n\r\nIf you're going
    to get ITC Stone, get it from the Stone Foundry. Be a bit thoughtful though. The
    sans is just a touch larger than the serif -- or maybe its the other way. The
    informal doesn't usually blend too well if you're using both the sans & serif.
    My wife designed a book using all three which worked. It had three voices, a narrative
    track, an expert track, and an advice to families track. Using all three successfully
    was uncommon enough that Sumner included it in his exhibit at the SF library.\r\n\r\nITC
    Stone works best at slightly larger sizes, say 11-point, and as Bill says, can
    be a bit spikey. It was designed when we still ran repro, shot negatives, and
    burned plates, so the contrast in the letterforms is fairly great.\r\n\r\nFor
    general text use, I like Cycles much more, again from the Stone foundry. Sumner
    recently lowered his prices; there are some tremendous values there. I also like
    Magma and SFPL. Stone print is also useful when you have to pack text into a narrow
    measure.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nNot to get into a pissing match with Nick, but how
    much you interject yourself into a design -- esp. with type choice -- depends
    on the text you are setting. If  there is an author, their ideas and audience
    are paramount. If *you* want to challenge a reader, write your own book.\r\n\r\nIf
    it is unattributed text as in a brochure, there is likely more room for innovation
    in type choice."
