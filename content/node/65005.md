    the last bakery I did a logo for I was going to use <a href=http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html>
    Delicious,</a> because it worked - and the owner was amused by the font's fitting
    name. In the end, I used another one that worked even better. <a href=http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html>
    Fontin,</a> also by Jos Buivenga.\r\n\r\nBefore that I used Garamond for the name
    (Grainfields) and some hand-lettered blackletter spelling out \"Das Brot\" in
    a banner under a sheaf of wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2026\r\n-=\xAE=-\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Doesn\u2019t panaderia mean bakery?\r\n\r\nI can comprehend, why hrant has
    proposed Motter Corpus, but I think, you should find a font, that \"matches\"
    with the kind of bread \u2013 a German bread is very different from an US American
    bread or a French bread."

    narrow space in 'de'.\r\n\r\nAlso, I find the spotlight effect concerning. What
    would it look like on plain white?"

  body: "-arno\r\n  yes it does mean the same thing, in Spanish. The target market
    is the Spanish market. matching the font with Motter corpus is a good idea to
    match the 'baked' puffiness.\r\n-mrMoto, I agree with the oddness\r\n-altaira,
    It is not an upmarket bakery [yet], most likely I will do a redesign (does the
    handwritten make it seem an upmarket bakery ?\r\n\r\nThank you all for your help
    and [in my defense, i have not yet officially taken gd courses :P, I'm an architecture
    student but enjoy very much to do gd as well.] "

    have to say though that the star form is right on for a bakery!

  body: "<cite>\"It is not an upmarket bakery\"</cite>\r\nThen I think you need to
    open up your search again. It's not just the handwritten thing that looks posh,
    you've got it all: centered alignment, a star in gold!, classy serifed, tracked-out
    all-caps. And that gradient. It does look good, just potentially too high-class.
    \u2013\_Motter Corpus is a good suggestion in terms of earthiness / puffiness
    I think; find a font that smells like fresh baked country bread. :-)\r\n\r\nAlso:
    If you have the word \"Bakery\" in 2 languages, you may want to set those so that
    the 2 words also look like they have the same function. This way it looks like
    \"Bakery\" is the \"subline\", but \"Panaderia\" looks like, dunno, the signature
    of the founder or something. "

  body: Or bake letters for inspiration. Maybe you can make the logo from  scratch
    without using an existing font. I just remember the numbers, that my mother had
    baked on a few of my birthdays. At least I would ask the bakery for a few of their
    breads. Motter Corpus is heavy and relatively cornered. It would match to bread
    like <strong><a href="http://ademie.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/bread480.jpg">this</a></strong>
    or <strong><a href="http://schnuppschnuess.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/19/kln_zimmermann_schwarzbrot1.jpg">this</a></strong>,
    but not to a light baguette.

    of your sample also would match to bread, although it does not look like bread.
    But it would match to French bread, not to German bread. I just see, that you
    have used two different Antiquas in your sample. I meant the one, which you used
    for \"Estrella\"."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image_6558.jpg]\r\n\r\nI will consider
    the redesign without an existing font and I'll let the shapes, colorful palettes.\r\n\r\nThe
    quote from the article I posted previously \"The decision to develop the project
    into the identity for a \u201Cpanader\xEDa\u201D became obvious when the students
    started buying and eating bread as part of their daily routine while in Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nThis
    is also true for migrants in the area I reside. Buying bread as a daily routine
    is accustomed in their country of origin and when it became available [just within
    the last 5 years] it was evident the tradition was not lost and their routine
    would not have to take a plunge. The desired customers definitely love their morning
    [and evening] bread with hot chocolate or other traditional beverage.\r\nThe foreseen
    bakery is small [not fancy] but its attempt it to stand out from the other established
    bakeries [ a few in other townships but none in the township it will be established],
    but the goal is not to step over the boundary and over the customers comfort zone.
    The migrants are costumed to simple [decor] and anything [logo identity] that
    resembles their small town hand lettered signs and bright colours. The focus is
    not on the fancy or strange. The main goal is between the cross breed between
    a small coffee shop feel with a \"panaderia\". The more home-town feel the better
    while keeping it well designed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as I write this and see my previous
    design, I now think, If I was one of those customers, I would not walk in there
    to buy my morning [evening] bread :)\r\n\r\nthank everyone, i will work on a redesign
    and post for comment."
