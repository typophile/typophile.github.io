body: Hello - I'm looking for a free sans serifed font to go with Gotham. I'm designing
  a yoga schedule and am using Gotham as the type font and need a sans serifed font
  to use as the headers. I would prefer a free font avail. online. Thanks!

    I doubt a free font will be significantly better.\r\nIf it's because you only
    have one weight look at serif fonts to contrast against the sans serif.\r\nMartin"

  body: "I agree with Martin. Why mix it with another sans? There are condensed weights
    of Gotham if you\u2019re thinking that Gotham is too wide for your headers.\r\n\r\nIf
    you\u2019re looking for something \u2018fancier\u2019 you could also try Museo
    / Museo Slab, it\u2019s ten a penny (actually, one weight is free \u2013 although
    I\u2019d go with one of the extreme weights).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/exljbris/museo_slab_family_ot/"

  body: "I'd really look at matching an opposing style to the body copy, sans on sans
    I've never really seen exectued  totally successfully. You could always look at
    a slab serif, ie Archer by H+F the italic is really quite fantastic used in a
    headline.\r\nMartin"

  body: I think a yoga schedule, even one that can afford Gotham, should be fine with
    a single family, using different weights for the text vs heads.
