body: So.. I&#39;m in Will&#39;s class and here is my typeface, Nostalgia. A typeface
  affectted by storytelling and time. Any suggestions? Do any characters not fit with
  the rest of the set? Thanks!  Jessie <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7176.jpg"

  body: This feels really unique, Jessica. Nice work. Can you set a few words and
    post a sample? <BR> <BR>The &#34;bubble&#34; &#40;if you will&#41; works nicely
    when it&#39;s inside the bowl &#40;ie. B,C,D&#41; but feels awkward when outside
    &#40;ie. J, X, Z&#41; <BR> <BR>Would love to see more!

    it out. I will set some words and post, thank you for the suggestions.

  body: 'Jessica, it seems a beautiful unconscious amalgam between Adobe&#39;s Duc
    De Berry &#40;i9n the Type Before Gutemperg&#41; series, Oscillator &#40;or one
    of its brothers&#41; from T-26 and Tralfalmadore by Fred Nader, with an overall
    feeling of cuteness. <BR>The most odd mix which has come to my mind to date. <BR>
    <BR>My only advice: give it a strong geometrical construction after you&#39;ve
    designed it freehand and you&#39;ll have a masterpiece &#40;of course if you don&#39;t
    like basic geometry it&#39;s a useless idea&#41;.'

    That would completely ruin it! <BR>And I do love Geometry - but it has to be used

  body: 'I agree with Jared&#39;s comment about the positioning of the &#39;bubble&#39;.
    It&#39;s lovely when it bulges inside a bowl, but when it disturbs the outer form
    of the letter it is too destructive. The J is a particular problem in this regard:
    the bubble really interrupts the form of the letter. You could fix this letter
    by shifting the bubble so that the outer curve of the J is maintain, as you have
    for B, D, etc. I would consider leaving the bubble off the X and Z altogether,
    and instead give these letters treatment similar to Y. The top of Z could be treated
    like E and F. <BR> <BR>There doesn&#39;t seem to be any logic to where you are
    using the double-stroke.'

  body: '&#62;Are you serious? <BR> <BR>It would just be my approach. Geometry could
    have various degrees of complexity. Just look at the wonderful use Miles does
    of basic geometry without sacrificing spontaneity. A good piece of my research
    is centered around this. And the approach depends entirely on where Jessica wishes
    to head.  <BR> <BR>I agree with Jared &amp; John&#39;s observations, anyway.'

  body: nice shapes, jessica. <BR> <BR>i agree with cladio about making it more geometric
    <BR>&#40;nice references!&#41;. i think that it would help you <BR>making more
    &#34;logical&#34; shapes too, as john commented. <BR> <BR>btw, is this a unicase
    font? imho, this should be  <BR>only caps... i think b and d are not fitting with  <BR>others
    characters.

  body: here is what i&#39;ve been working on... i&#39;ve changed some of the characters
    slightly, but now that i have read some of you comments i&#39;m going to try some
    other things with X, Z and such. yes, it is a unicase font, if i enlarge the bowl
    in the b &amp; d will it help?? also, i wanted your opinion on the period and
    comma? diamond or use circles like on the terminals on the letters? thanks!  <BR>

    bubbles the exact same size time, maybe geometry sneaking in!

  body: I would keep the &#34;x-height&#34; consistent. This makes a typeface solid,
    even if you use ascenders and descenders in an all-caps design. <BR>So I would
    do the b, h and d bowls, the i and j height &#40;dot exluded&#41; and the t crossbar,
    at the same caps height of the other letters. The ascenders of course will exceed
    the caps height. <BR> <BR>Also, I would keep a certain consistency of the terminals.
    Tha A is very nice and balanced. Keep it as a basis and use the A&#39;s bolder
    terminal to make the other terminals behave like it &#40;quite like you did in
    W&#41;. <BR>The inconsistency is more evident in letters like the new F. The old
    F and G were better. <BR>T and Y are very good and balanced indeed. <BR>Shorten
    also the L horizontal stroke and keep the &#34;ascender&#34; part the same you
    will do with b, d etc. <BR> <BR>I think stroke consistency will help, no matter
    if the approach is more calligraphic or more geometric.

    rounded.
