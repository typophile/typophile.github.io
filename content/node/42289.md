  have set the correct time zone (EST) in my Typophile account settings, but the home
  page always shows Pacific time. I have refreshed, cleared my cache, cookies, etc.
  Is this just a programming flaw? Doesn't seem to matter what computer I'm on; logged
  in or not.\r\n\r\nPunchcut (you guys rock) or admins, any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRay"

    of Typophile.
