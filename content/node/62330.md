    castigates Sister James for allowing a ball point pen in her classroom. She believes
    that a fountain pen is the only writing implement the Lord allows and such heresy
    as a ballpoint pen is not to be condoned. "

    course, used nothing but ball-point pens with his students. He quickly demonstrated
    how you can create copperplate-style \"expanding stroke\" only by varying pressure
    using a ballpoint pen \u2013 it looked stunning."

  body: "friction between pen and paper is a very important issue. ballpoints glide
    over the surface nearly without friction. from my observations i would say that
    only a few people\u2019s handwriting can benefit from this, most people would
    be better off with less slippery tools, like fountain pens, pencils, felt tips
    or rapidographs.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>ballpoints glide over the surface nearly without friction.</em>\r\n\r\nThat
    depends heavily on the quality of the ballpoint. The kind of cheap disposable
    pens that school children are often given to use do not glide. Rather, the glutinous
    ink makes the ball sticky such that it doesn't roll where directed by the writer
    and, instead, rolls where the friction of the ink directs it."
