  attached image (used in JACKIE & ROBERT).  If anyone could help me out, it would
  be greatly appreciated - all the handwritten fonts I have come across lack the neatness
  and structure of this one.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/handwrittenfont_4212.jpg]"

    (Major Kong), and for free no less. It's not nearly as condensed as the sample
    above, though. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://type.fargoboy.com/\">This</a> (Pablo Skinny)
    is somewhat more similar to the sample in proportion, and seems to be based on
    the work of that same lettering artist who did the Strangelove titles."
