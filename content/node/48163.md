body: "I'm currently working out some details on a font that has Central European
  Language support. I have a fairly limited amount of experience with this and so
  I hope my question will make sense.\r\n\r\nI noticed while in Names mode that one
  of my glyph cells has _0127 as opposed to uni0127. I don't know what this empty
  cell is for or why it has the underscore before the number. I looked up 0127 in
  unicode and found it was the hbar. I have an hbar in the font already which shows
  up as 0127 when I switch modes. Does the underscore before the numbers mean I've
  somehow duplicated that glyph window? Its been a while since I added the language
  support to the font, so I don't recall exactly everything I did. Any ideas what
  this means?\r\n\r\nStephen Rapp"

  body: "Stephen, \r\n\r\nif you have both hbar and _0127, and they're identical,
    you should delete the _0127 glyph. FontLab Studio usually generates glyph names
    with underscores when it duplicates glyph by some means (e.g. drag and drop).

    though I'm not sure how. I will simply delete the cell.\r\nStephen"
