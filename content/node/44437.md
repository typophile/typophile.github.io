  body: Will you explain why you like this so much? Is it just that it is hand made
    or is it something more?

  body: Yes, I like the complexity of this ad and how the writer tried to solve it
    in his/her own way, by hand. I can have similar amusing feelings with some hand
    drawn note to find places.

  body: "There are some crazies in my neighborhood who make this sort of stuff and
    tack it up all over the place. One of them actually creates big protest signs
    like this about how Kissinger and the CIA conspired to kill his father. I\u2019ll
    have to start scanning them one of these days."
