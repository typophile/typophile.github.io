  includes downloadable .pdf versions of the extensive timeline diagrams that feature

  body: "This image from the book is misleading:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tree_5413.png]\r\n_\r\n\r\nIt
    suggests that the North Indian, Tibetan and Korean scripts are in a line of descent
    from modern Arabic. There is a hypothesis that Korean Hangul script was based
    in part on the Mongol 'Phags-pa script, which was in turn based on Tibetan, but
    the hypothesis is not widely accepted. More problematic, though, is the line through
    Arabic. To my knowledge there is no theory or evidence linking the Northern Indian
    scripts with Arabic: they're not even in the same class of writing systems. Perhaps
    the authors were confusing two the different Mongolian scripts  -- 'Phags-pa and
    Uyghur -- and their lines of descent, and extrapolating an incorrect line from
    Arabic to Korean. It should be something like\r\n\r\nAramaic ~> Brahmic -> North
    Indian -> Tibetan -> 'Phags-pa ~> Korean\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nAramaic -> Syriac ->
    Sogdian -> Uyghur -> Mongolian"

  body: "Hello John,\r\n\r\nShame on us. Of course you are right with your correction.
    I just mailed Geert and he looked again in his sources (the dutch translation
    of The Joy of Knowledge, Editor James Mitchell, Published by Beazley Encyclopedias
    Ltd 1976, London and www.ancientscripts.com). \r\nThere is indeed a design flaw
    in the diagram. The link between Nothern Indian and Modern Arabic is false. The
    line from Northern Indian had to go to Brahmin.\r\nOf course the diagram can be
    enhanced with the suggestions you do and we will consider that of course in a
    reprint. At the time Geert was making the diagram the chart in the enclosed picture
    (in dutch) was his main source. With your correction and the info on www.ancientscripts.com
    we can make it better the next time. Thanks for your input! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schema_5574.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/alfabetScanBook_4096.jpg]"
