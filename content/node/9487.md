body: 'What do you guys think of having more than one italics in a typeface? Although
  this is not a completely original idea, examples are extremely rare, and the two
  &#34;historical&#34; ones I know of &#40;Bembo and Electra&#41; only had a second
  italics made after the first one was rejected &#40;with the first one losing all
  promotion&#41;. As for contemporary works, the only one &#40;well, the only &#42;other&#42;
  one... :-&#41; I know of for a fact is the upcoming Sauna &#40;previously &#34;Sofa&#34;&#41;
  from the increasingly amazing Underware: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.underware.nl/site/sauna/general/twoitalics.php3"

  <BR>Sauna however isn&#39;t a full-fledged text face &#40;by Underware&#39;s own
  admission&#41;, so a text face with &#42;intentional&#42; multiple italics I have
  yet to encounter. The only thing I&#39;ve heard &#40;again, from a friend in Underware&#41;
  is that Majoor&#39;s recent Seria has a second italics &#40;which makes sense because
  the &#34;main&#34; italics has almost no slant - unorthodox, but I love it&#41;,
  except FontFont does not show it on their site &#40;and I don&#39;t know where to
  look for it&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, thoughts and examples greatly welcome. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Well, there are a few fonts with alternate swash italics &#40;Adobe Caslon,
    Adobe Garamond, HTF Hoefler Text, etc.&#41;, but I suppose that&#39;s not exactly
    the same thing. <BR> <BR>The only others I can think of are Adobe Poetica &#40;<A
    HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4328.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4328.html</A>&#41;

    TARGET="_top">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4556.html</A>&#41;. <BR> <BR>Both
    of these are technically italics anyway, with companion italic ITALICS. &#40;I
    know. Don&#39;t ask me. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> &#41; I think in both cases, the &#34;italic&#34; forms are best
    used as alternate italics rather than italic forms of the italic. &#40;Okay --
    I&#39;m confusing even myself now....&#41; <BR> <BR>Like Majoor&#39;s Seria, though,
    the italic italics are sloped &#40;well, MORE sloped&#41; than the &#34;roman&#34;
    italics. &#40;I think I need an aspirin....&#41; <BR> <BR>David &#40;I think&#41;

  body: ' More power to them. I say the more the merrier. To take it one step further,
    why just italics? Italics are a just a traditional way of mixing two writing styles.
    It would be cool to see more variations within type &#34;families.&#34; There
    have been some recent forrays into serif, and sans versions of faces that are
    in fact completely different but work very well together &#40;ie scala&#41;, but
    that isn&#39;t extraordinarily innovative. In what other ways could type families
    be expanded? '

  body: 'Fairfield has two sets of Italics, plus swash capitals. It&#39;s probably
    my favorite transitional design. One thing I wish more fonts would have is simply
    a pairing of Roman uppercase with Italic lowercase as seen in Adobe&#39;s Poetica
    IV. It looks <BR>nice in Palatino, though it might not work for <BR>every font.
    <BR> <BR>If you include the swash uppercase characters, you can have six different
    kinds of italics per weight of Fairfield: <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/954.gif"

  body: 'Wow - great find. <BR>So I guess the first column shows the cursive lc italics,
    and the second shows &#91;what I might call&#93; the &#34;sober&#34; lc, and each
    is paired with three kinds of caps: italics &#40;shared?&#41;, roman, and swash.
    <BR> <BR>Looking at what MyFonts has&#42;, it seems that the &#34;sober&#34; one
    might be meant for titling &#40;called &#34;caption&#34;&#42;&#42;&#41;, and Adobe
    says&#42;&#42;&#42;  that it was actually designed in the 90s by Alex Kaczun.
    And note that the &#34;sober&#34;/caption fonts look bigger on the body than the
    cursive. So I guess they&#39;re not really interchangable in terms of being used
    with the roman.  :-&#40; <BR> <BR>BTW, since I started this thread I found a font
    that comes pretty close to what I&#39;m looking for: Arrow&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;,
    by Treacy. But since the second italic was designed as an afterthought &#40;due
    to customer demand for a clean sloped roman&#41;, it&#39;s &#42;still&#42; not
    exactly it... <BR> <BR>&#42; <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily78.html"

    <BR>It&#39;s funny that Adobe is now using that term to mean small type. <BR>
