body: "I have a problem with a font I adapted. The original font was a distorted font,
  but I changed it a bit, so that \"abba\" would not have the same glyphs. (3 alternates
  for lowercase, and 2 for caps) However, with the generated font, I have a problem
  with just the glyph 4, and I can't find the error.\r\nCan I send someone the Fontlab
  file for testing?\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nMartino"
