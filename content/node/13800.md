  Suitcase for a while and find it buggy and slow. How is Fontagents auto enabling?
  What are the plus and minuses?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Regardless of what font manager you are using (FontReserve, FontBook, FontAgent,
    Suitcase) I find that some simple practices help reduce the chance of problems.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    I run the system with a fairly lean set of system fonts. Typically I empty:\r\n/Users/<my
    username>/Library/Fonts/\r\n/Library/Fonts/\r\nIn my Classic Fonts folder I only
    keep the following fonts Charcoal, Chicago, Geneva and Monaco. This is located
    in:\r\n/System Folder/Fonts/\r\nNOTE: THE ABOVE IS NOT THE SAME AS /SYSTEM/LIBRARY/FONTS!\r\nI
    usually leave /System/Library/Fonts alone. It contains about 30 basic fonts, including
    the font (LucidaGrande) needed for OSX system menus.  \r\n\r\nThe removed fonts
    get added to my font manager.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if I have lots of duplicate fonts
    loaded, I usually reduce my expectation that auto-activation will work.  Suitcase
    has FontSync technology which is supposed to tell the difference between fonts
    with the same Postscript name but different metrics.  I haven't really played
    with it enough to know if it always works. \r\nSuitcase also comes with Font Doctor,
    which is pretty handy for checking large groups of fonts. I often make a copy
    of fonts before I let Font Doctor molest them though. \r\n\r\nFont Agent has a
    \"font player\" so you can sit back and watch your fonts scroll by like a slideshow.
    \ Coooooool!\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, switching between font managers is not for the faint of heart.  Stephen
    is right, of course. I'm not sure I agree with his fix, though-- I like Suitcase's
    preview pane.  \r\n\r\nAlso, Apple's FontBook is a wierd grey area in terms of
    font management. Earlier incarnations were basically a tool for moving font in
    and out of the system fonts folders. Now, it can actually deactivate fonts without
    removing them from the system font folders. This is somewhat unintuitive.  However,
    if you don't use FontBook, you don't really want to delete it, since it contains
    OS X's font icons. Dumping the Font Book plist is probably smart though. So, it
    ends up being an annoying exception to Stephen's rule. "
