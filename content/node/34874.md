body: "Imagine my surprise when, while browsing for comforters at Bed Bath & Beyond,
  I came across this: a <em>serif</em> drapery rod!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serif
  Rod_3730.jpg]\r\nIn context, the serif is pretty clearly the name for the ornament
  at the end of the rod, so the similarity to the typographic variety is obvious.
  Maybe this is well-known, but it certainly made shopping momentarily more interesting
  for me."
