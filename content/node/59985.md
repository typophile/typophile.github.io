  The problem is I really want to use PMN Caecilia and I can't find a san serif font
  that has a similar feel to it, to use in conjunction. Essentially i'm looking for
  a font that looks pretty much like Caecilia but without the slab serifs.  There
  are loads of fonts which are almost right like Verdana, Fedra and The Sans but nothing
  exact.  Does anyone know if such a thing exists? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
