  tried everything out like 'what the font', 'type navigator' and so..\r\nI'm afraid
  that this font is a kind of customized something or even worse to identify.\r\n\r\nSo
  if anybody has a clue, -that would be great!\r\nThanks in advance and\r\nregards
  from the Netherlands,\r\n\r\nTILL TOMORROW.\r\n~"

    you could probably quite easily draw this in Illustrator,

  body: "Hee, thanks for replying. There's nothing great about that font, just a coincidence,
    I tried to help a colleague of mine, but it seems like he'd also find the way
    to typophile-forum..\r\nUnfortunately I do not have more samples of the font.
    Maybe he does, I will ask him to put them here.\r\n\r\nThank you anyways,\r\nregards,\r\n\r\nTILL
