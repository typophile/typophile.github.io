body: ' Hi! <BR> <BR>As you all know, MacOS 7.5 came with a whole bunch of QuickDraw
  GX fonts like Hoefler Text with huge character sets which most of us didn&#39;t
  have access to. I&#39;ve recently bought InDesign 2.0 and noticed that I could access
  these characters with the &#34;insert glyph&#34; command. My question is, is there
  a way to map the open type features to these alternate glyphs? So instead of having
  to click on the small caps of Hoefler Text to type them, I could select the text
  and covert them to true small caps? That would be nice, you know, as I really like
  Hoefler Text and cannot afford to buy the PostScript version from Johnathan Hoefler...
  <BR> <BR>Just wondering... <BR> <BR>Keith. '

    OpenType that I&#39;ve ever seen. If you change your mind about picking up the
    PostScript version from us, I&#39;ll be happy to send you the OpenType version
    when we get around to it, too. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>Jonathan Hoefler '
