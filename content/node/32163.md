  body: "The chances are some smartarse blogger will mention goatse (if you are tempted
    to google this don't blame me for the consequences). I like the contrast of organic
    against the clean numeral, but for me the organic has to be either symmetrical
    or clearly not. I don\u2019t find the type choice sympathetic to the business,
    maybe upper and lower case would work better, it would also help with the HTH
    and AY kerning. It is also worth mentioning the axiom of working up a logo so
    it can work in a single colour without the grads, which would actually fit in
    with the green nature of the business too.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "For the most part, I like it. It says \"spa\" or \"fitness centre\" to me,
    and it looks like it's targeted to women (the '8' shape mirroring the curves of
    the female body). However, the colour choice bugs me. To me, yellow leaves represent
    dying plants, not healthy ones. Maybe use the deeper green for the plant and a
    lime green for the '8'.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    I think the logo is gorgeous.  Truly.  Nice work. \r\n\r\nThe text is fine, but
    I agree with Tim.  It doesn't take away from the logo, but it doesn't add anything,
    either. \r\n\r\nAK"

  body: "Thanks guys, ill have another on up later today. I need to rework the middle
    flower so as no overlaps occur, and also figure out how to make it a B&W logo.
    Im not sure if just outlining the gradient parts with a thin stroke would work,
    or just look naff. \r\n\r\nWe'll see\r\nthanks again\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nJames"

  body: "In Illustrator and Photoshop, change the colour pallette to HSB and remove
    the Hue and Saturation values. This will give you a direct grayscale representation.
    \r\n\r\nAll logo's should be designed in grayscale first imo, to establish a good
    contrast between the various elements, as well as possible background colours.
    After that it shouldn't be too hard to choose colours with a brightness similar
    to what you have in grayscale.\r\n\r\nThis is what I ended up with as a direct
    conversion:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eighth_day-bw_3892.png]"

      of want a solid simply black and white logo as well? I suppose in terms of reproduction
      and production greyscale works fine. . . I'm trying to figure out how to design
      it to be simply black and white and also allow for the obvious addition of colour.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames"

    newspaper classified ads, etc etc ... \r\n\r\nMaybe you can make it work by making
    the plant black (knocking out the edges from the 8) then simply outlining the
    lighter (gradient) areas of the 8.  \r\n\r\nOr, perhaps keep all the 8 black and
    add a hairline to indicate the curves that divide it into the gradient areas.
    \r\n\r\nAK"

  body: "I don't think it works in grayscale at all. The word DAY just recedes to
    the background.\r\n\r\nI think you need to make the mark work in strict black
    and white with no reliance on the gradients you used in the original. I say this
    because they will probably require the logo to be executed in vinyl for use on
    the store window or front door. I would hate to have to plot, weed and lineup
    3 colors of green just to execute the current logo in vinyl.\r\n\r\nLeaving that
    concern aside, the mark still needs work. Your inner flower is off-center for
    no obvious reason, when the mark begs for symmetry. Also the flower looks like
    it was frankensteined from different dingbats. It would look better if it was
    more customized.\r\n\r\nOne last thing, the icon is way too big in relation to
    the text. I'm afraid that when reduced to fit on a business card, the text will
    be too small."
