  to do a yacht logo for a client, he wants \"Hattitude\" rather than the \"Hatteras\"
  yacht that it is. \r\n\r\nI'm looking to identify the font in the Hatteras Logo,
  or something close to it that I can manipulate.  I've attached the image.  Thanks
  all!\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/hatteras.jpg"

    as large as this, I wouldn't be surprised.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I think I'll be able
    to create most of the lettering I need from what already exists in \"Hatteras\"
    --- I'll give it a go. \r\n\r\nThanks for the reply Lex!"
