  body: "So, I take it nobody know what this font is?  :)\r\n\r\nMaybe I should correct
    my statement.\r\nNot text as in book text, but for copy text inside the page/content.\r\nWhat
    is the name for that?\r\nI usually prefer sans for those text.\r\nAnd enlighten
    me maybe, what typeface(s) are good for book text?"
