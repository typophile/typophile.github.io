		<div class="commentbody">Part of the reason what we're rebranding is that we're refocusing as purely a web development firm.  We had a partner who was quite adept at graphic design work, but the relationship didn't work out, so we're (with good reason I think you'll agree) getting out of that business.   <BR> <BR>I don't want to offer any services where we can't provide professional-level work.  Logo design now falls into that category, so we're no longer offering those services. <BR> <BR>I've been disappointed with the results I've received from the contest thus far, and I agree that this is by no means the most noble way of acquiring a decent corporate identity, and that I really should be paying a few grand to a real graphic designer to get the work done. (Anyone want to loan me some money? j/k) <BR> <BR>So that I'm sufficiently informed if/when this first attempt doesn't work, can anyone recommend how a small (micro?) business can get a reasonably good logotype/symbol with a budget of just a few hundred dollars?  (I realize that most proper graphic designers wouldn't do it for such a paltry sum, but that unfortunately is all I have to work with.) <BR> <BR>To answer Gerald's question: I'm not trying to have you guys make any sort of decision for me. I happened across this site a few days ago because I was looking around the web for logo ideas, and since I'm interested in typography, thought I'd sign up.  Since I'm currently in the middle of a predicament in which I could use some experienced advice about typography and branding, I think it's reasonable that some of my initial posts would be about said situation.</div>

Their limitations are inherent in the process.  <BR> <BR>Good design requires a lot more background work before anything visual emerges. The designoutpost.com method pretty much guarantees the absence of the necessary background work. A good doctor wouldn't diagnose you over the phone &ndash; and a good designer won't come up with a design solution solely over the internet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm far from being naive, especially since I have been a professional graphic designer for 25 years, but I'm really stunned that so many designers invested so much time and energy for the CHANCE at so little in compensation. <BR> <BR>I'm no longer surprised when businesses (of any size) opt to put so little investment into the primary branding or identity element on which they rely for the promotion and customer recognition of their business venture in the marketplace.  After all, in the 1970's Nike did originally pay only $35 for their logo - which Phil Knight accepted with some reluctance due to a looming print deadline.  At least the company made it up to the designer years later with the gift of a good sum of stock and a day in her honor. <BR> <BR>At the end of his career designer Paul Rand would take on one identity project a year for the fee of $100,000.  I think that's a great fee goal for any designer - instead of bidding to see just how inexpensively (i.e. cheaply) one can produce such a project.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Jeff Fisher <BR>Engineer of Creative Identity <BR> <BR>Jeff Fisher LogoMotives <BR><a href="http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com">http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com</a></a></div>
