  body: Hmm well I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to word being mistreated every now and
    then. That&#39;s the way it&#39;s written in a text by George Pennec so I would
    guess it&#39;s correct... Maybe there are other translations. <BR> <BR>Opinions
    anyone? =&#41;

  body: 'Using the ae ligature is considered somewhat archaic in U.S. English -- in
    fact, American usage has dropped the leading a in most instances. &#40;For example:
    encyclopaedia vs. encyclopedia.&#41; <BR> <BR>Although British style retains both
    letters in most instances, I do not know whether they commonly use the ligature
    or not. I suspect it is not necessarily improper to use it, but it may look quaint/mannered/overly
    formal.'

  body: Moreover, I believe the &amp;aelig; ligature is only properly used in English
    for words derived from Latin that contain the specific ae dipthong in question,
    not any random occurrence of the a-e letter sequence.

  body: 'In Norwegian and Danish, &amp;ldquo;&amp;aelig;&amp;rdquo; is not a ligature
    of &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;e&amp;rdquo;, but an independent letter,
    representing the vowel sound in English &amp;ldquo;hat&amp;rdquo;. Using &amp;ldquo;ae&amp;rdquo;
    as a substitute for &amp;ldquo;aelig;&amp;rdquo; in Norwegian and Danish would
    be akin to using &amp;ldquo;vv&amp;rdquo; as a substitute for &amp;ldquo;w&amp;rdquo;
    in English&amp;mdash;comprehensible, but jarring. <BR> <BR>Regarding &amp;ldquo;et
    cetera&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;et caetera&amp;rdquo;: either is acceptable, but
    the former is found more frequently than the latter, at least in English language
    contexts. <BR> <BR>I believe that &amp;ldquo;&amp;aelig;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;&amp;oelig;&amp;rdquo;
    usage in &#40;post-Anglo-Saxon&#41; English had been preferred for words ultimately
    of Greek origin that were spelled with alpha-iota and omicron-iota respectively.
    As the Latin word &amp;ldquo;c&#40;a&#41;eterus&amp;rdquo; [for which &amp;ldquo;c&#40;a&#41;etera&amp;rdquo;
    is likely the feminine ablative] is not of Greek origin, it probably shouldn&amp;lsquo;t
    be spelled with &amp;aelig;.'
