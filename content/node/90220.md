  body: Old... How old? Could be pre-digital and so may be never digitized. I'm probably
    wrong but it reminds me somehow [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile/|Eurostile]].
    May be [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100041|Forza]]
    and/or [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100035|Tungsten]]
    could be considered as good substitutes...
