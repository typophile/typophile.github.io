  as if it ought to be true, and can <BR>see it on a visceral level, but I wondered

  body: 'There are so many variables involved, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible
    to isolate one. If you were to conduct a thoroughly empirical experiment, you
    would vary word space against each of these in multiple combinations: <BR> <BR>-line
    length <BR>-type size <BR>-type style  <BR>-type face <BR>-type weight <BR>-tracking
    &#40;letterspacing&#41; <BR>-leading <BR>-word length <BR>-language <BR>-ink color/paper
    stock <BR> <BR>and that&#39;s just in the type specs. You would also have to vary
    text, and readers&#39; age, education, sex, etc.,, and the reading environment,
    if you wanted to come up with a legitimate general principle. <BR> <BR>You could
    however focus on a specific relationship. One that concerns me as a type designer
    is the amount of contiguous white space in glyphs: for instance, consider a word
    ending in &#34;t&#34; and the following space: the &#34;t&#34; in Helvetica has
    two protusions on the right, the &#34;t&#34; in Futura just one. how does this
    affect the size of the following word space? The experiment would involve designing
    a typeface with alternate versions of the t, and seeing how that effected word
    space. Another thing to vary is the amount of protrusion of the crossbar in f,
    and t, and the arm in &#34;r&#34;. <BR> <BR>'

  body: Thanks Nick, <BR>you read my mind. I&#39;m in the process of designing <BR>some
    sort of visual demonstration of typographic  <BR>variables, comparing one against
    the other. I was <BR>sticking to line length, wordspace, global letter- <BR>spacing
    &#40;tracking&#41; and type size, although now <BR>you mention ink colour and
    paper stock, I wonder <BR>if I can integrate that. Hum. <BR> <BR>You mention word
    length, which is interesting.  <BR>I was assuming, because a word is usually <BR>bigger
    than a wordspace, that as the length of  <BR>a line increases, the amount of printed
    area  <BR>in the line increases more quickly than the  <BR>unprinted area, and
    this is why the wordspace <BR>should be increased. But this is a very  <BR>tentative
    supposition, and I&#39;ve been trying <BR>fruitlessly to prove it to myself mathematically.
    <BR>I think I might be on a fool&#39;s errand ... <BR> <BR>The wordspace in relation
    to specific glyphs <BR>is also something I&#39;ve been thinking about in <BR>a
    very fuzzy way. I tend to see it in relation <BR>to the end of one sentence and
    a following <BR>sentence starting with &#34;T&#34;, which is pretty  <BR>common.
    Sometimes it can get quite gappy, <BR>depending on the font.   <BR> <BR>Thanks
    again for your help, you&#39;ve made me  <BR>think about the problem differently.
    I was <BR>getting pretty blinkered. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know the answers here, but it seems to me more than one goal
    and standard is involved.  For example, increasing word space in longer lines
    may help evenness of color, an aesthetic consideration, but may harm readability,
    which is influenced by consistency of rhythm of the letters and spaces. <BR> <BR>In
    &#39;The Finer Points in Spacing&#39; Dowding gives convincing examples of where
    excessive word spacing hurts readability, because the eye doesn&#39;t hold to
    the line of text as easily. On the other hand, his own word spaces to my eye are
    so pinched that they make reading more difficult.  <BR> <BR>Good luck on your
    research &amp; do post your results!   '

  body: 'Alex, this is indeed a great topic. <BR> <BR>Patterson and Tinker did a lot
    of solid empirical research in the 50s and 60s, but I don&#39;t remember anything
    specific about word spaces &#40;you might check&#41;. As Nick says, the massive
    inter-relation of variables is very daunting. And I agree with William too: I
    have my doubts about making word spaces longer in proportion to line length. It
    might actually do more harm, not just in the way William notes, but also because
    the longer the line the more you depend on the leading to find your way back to
    the beginning of the next line, and bigger word spaces make that harder. Lastly,
    the more horizontal room a line takes the slower the reading. <BR> <BR>If Spiekermann
    would give a reason, we could analyze it - maybe there&#39;s something I&#39;m

  body: 'Hello Hrant, <BR> <BR>thanks for the Patterson Tinker information, I&#39;ll  <BR>go
    and have a look at that. As for the wordspace/ <BR>line length conundrum, maybe
    I&#39;m looking at it in <BR>the wrong way. Perhaps it&#39;s more helpful to see
    it <BR>as shorter lines having smaller wordspaces. I can  <BR>see how this might
    be the case on a newspaper, <BR>for example, where short lines with minimal  <BR>leading
    necessitate tighter horizontal spacing to <BR>maintain a more coherent horizontality.
    Whether  <BR>there&#39;s more to it than economic necessity though, <BR>I don&#39;t

  body: 'It recently occurred to me that there is another factor involved in word
    spacing: kerning. <BR> <BR>When you have a word starting with a &#34;needs kerning&#34;
    combination of characters, it requires a certain amount of word-space preceding
    it, in order that the first letter doesn&#39;t look like a single word. This is
    particularly apparent for the nasties: T,V,W and Y followed by a round lowercase
    letter. <BR> <BR>Hence the huge spacing in 19thC typography. <BR> <BR>In a tightly
    fitted and kerned face, you can even put kerning between the space character and
    letters such as A,T,W,W,Y, and period and comma.'

    to be legible your line is too long and you should redesign. Long lines, big word
    spacing = swiss cheese.
