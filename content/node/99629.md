  body: "is this font autohinted?\r\nJust a guess, since there's not much info here,
    but it looks like the ascender heights are incorrect in application and values,
    you might want to try generating without autohinting, to see if it removes the
    problem. Then if it does, try adjusting the hints.\r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "BTW are you adding Vietnamese accents to an existing font? If so, here are
    two things to consider:\r\n1) I think they're exceedingly small - too small to
    be functional.\r\n2) Most fonts have a EULA (license agreement) that doesn't allow
    modification; but even ones that do rarely allow you to <em>redistribute</em>
    the results - so you have to make sure you're the only user of the modified font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    font is from my client,  it does not have VNese accents, so i have to add VNese
    accents, basing on an Unicode font. Thank you!"
