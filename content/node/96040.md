body: I have 2 different TT font files....trouble is, I want just the lower case "y"
  to be in the other font replacing the y there that's included in it.....Would this
  be able to be done? And if so, would someone be willing to do that for me and make
  a resulting TT file? I would tell which font the "y" will come from and the font
  it is to go into replacing the "y" there etc.. Thanks

    can be altered.
