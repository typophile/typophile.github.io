		<div class="commentbody">Haytouy? Fiatouy? Unfortunately, the beginning and end characters are too ambiguous for quick recognition by Latin-alphabet users.

I suspect the first letter is H, simply because I know that "Hay..." begins the Armenian word for Armenian. But that's not going to be apparent to most people who see this.

So the first letter looks like F, Fi, or h, and the last letter looks like y or G - but not close enough in either case for them to be recognizable.

And, indeed, I have been able to find out the [[http://ayfwest.org/programs/haytoug/archive/|spoiler.]]

So this is a new logo, used on the Summer 2014 issue of their publication. Hrant can take our comments back to them to explain that their logo is just a tad too ambiguous, and needs a redesign.</div>

The "h" sound in Armenian is the letter "Հ"/"հ" and the "gu" sound is "Կ"/"կ". So it's "HAYTOUG" (which means "freedom fighter" in Armenian) so I guess it's close but no cigar. Since I have nativity in Armenian I can't tell, which is why I asked.

* BTW the lowercase only became so Latinized in the late 19th century.

I would tell them about the problem (one day I'm sure I will, afforded the right pretext) but since it's a volunteer operation I'm unlikely to get more than puzzled indignation...

BTW it's tempting to think this sort of thing is only read by people who already know how to read it anyway, but of course that ignores the high value of spreading our message to "odar"s (non-Armenians).

		<div class="commentbody">Having found the publication and having glanced at the contents of a few issues, it may be just as well. Yes, the Armenian people have a message to spread, but the wrong person reading it could get the impression that it's put out by a bunch of terrorists or something.

The Armenian homeland is in a very difficult situation; in order to have the ability to defend its people from attack, as in Nagorno-Karabazh, the regime has had to put itself on, as it were, the wrong side of history. I don't think now is the time to encourage Armenians in the United States to make aliyah; they won't be able to help change the corrupt regime there, they will just end up making Putin stronger.

While in most cases, the saying "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade" is just a facile response to those in bad situations, it has occurred to me that there may be some applicability here.

Yes, it is a problem that Armenians in the United States are so comfortable in their part of the diaspora that not enough of them are seriously considering a return to the homeland. And now is not the time when adventurers could follow in the footsteps of Teddy Roosevelt or Alexander Hamilton and carve out an alternative base for the Armenian people, so they could avoid having to rely on the powerful and risk losing their freedom.

But hope is staring the Armenian people in the face.
