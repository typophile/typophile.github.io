  body: "I searched my Script Font ID Guide and a couple of categories of free fonts
    at Dafont, but could not find this font. It is a type of font that could be easily
    made by anyone, and very cheaply, so it might be a 'custom' font, if this is connected
    to advertising. It could be anything, from a commercial font to a one-off hobbyist
    font, but there are too many fonts like this to know where to look. \r\n\r\nMy
    advice in this case is find something with a similar feel, and use that.\r\n\r\n-
