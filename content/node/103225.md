  Helvetica for the body text as it looks so much smoother and, in my opinion, much
  more contemporary than their current use of Adobe Garamond Pro.  \r\n\r\nHowever,
  I was approached today by my superior who told me that his wife (whom is a copy
  editor) \"had a lot of issues with using Helvetica and not a serif font for print.\"\r\n\r\nWhile
  serifs ARE easier for readability sake on print media, I'm a bit surprised that
  she seems to be unaware with how many people are using Helvetica to reach out to
  a plethora of audiences.  Our publication would reach mostly (but not only) those
  in their 40's-50's, and I can understand if this is where she's frustrated, but
  neither of those age groups are so old that they couldn't read a SOO commonly used
  font.  \r\n\r\nWhat are your guys' thoughts?  Why are so many publications using
  Helvetica, Akzidenz, etc, if studies show readability for printed media is best
  when found in serif?  I wonder what the greater percentage of readability is for
  a serif?  I'd like to have an informed answer for her.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

      religious congregation.  We are hoping to attract younger members because we
      are mostly 40s,50s,60s+.  We have 30s, but they aren't attracted to the stuff
      we have.  I want to hit that audience, too.\r\n\r\n\"Readability\" was based
      upon how others are defining it.  I guess, for me, wording is easier to read
      when I'm not distracted by the font.  Many serifs look distracting to me because
      I identify them with writing papers.  All the papers we ever had to write were
      in serifs.  They look old and tired to me, except for the more contemporary
      ones which I'm not sure we have the  money to spend on it, BUT I would love
      some suggestions for some contemporary ones.  I have Museo slab at 500, but
      a thinner weight might look nice.  Or a thinner weight of Mido (only have medium...).\r\n\r\n\"Print

  body: "Young people have to read too. It has little to do with failing eyesight.
    Readability is not essentially determined by familiarity. Helvetica has low readability
    (mostly due to its overly-tight spacing, but also for the paucity of its extenders).
    Plus it's overused, especially by mega-corporations (that don't even like religion
    :-). It's the first font you should totally avoid. Well, after Arial.  :-)\r\n\r\nGaramond
    is indeed too old-fashioned (here and in general) but don't blame the serifs.
    If you want a sans that's highly readable, use Legato. But probably the wife won't
    let you, so look for a contemporary serif font - there are tons of them.\r\n\r\nAnd
    anecdotal wisdom trumps poorly conceived and executed field testing any day.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Helvetica or Arial as text fonts on screen and in print are two different
    animals. I like the late Paul Rand's view, who told an assistant not to use Helvetica
    in text. When asked, \"Why?\" He replied \"because it looks like dogshit in text.\"
    \r\n\r\nIn general, I think it is clear that serifs are better for extended text
    in print, even though there is no scientific proof of it. Certainly, the vote
    of publishers and readers has gone that way, even though sans have been fully
    accepted in headings. \r\n\r\nAside from the question of the aesthetic look you
    want, Adobe Garamond in my opinion has problems at smaller sizes. Garamond Premier,
    which has optical sizes, has a beautiful text size. \r\n\r\nIt you want something
    fresher in the same general line as Garamond, look at the wonderful new [[http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/agmena/|Agmena]]
    \r\n\r\nI admit Paul Rand's view has to be modified somewhat now because of [[http://www.fontbureau.com/nhg/|Neue
    Haas Grotesk]]. Christian Schwartz did a text size, which can work nicely in short
    texts at relatively small sizes. But as I say, I don't think any sans is appropriate
    for extended text. \r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the notion of 'readability'
    is confused. I think the appropriate notion is in terms of ease or comfort in
    reading, and there I think in extended text, a very good serif will win the race. "

    those experienced by young people who are reading it with distinct letters in

    so many people use Helvetica? 1) Because their old-fart Modernism-brainwashed
    design teachers adore it and they pass down the bad advice. 2) It's retro, and

    I've seen in awhile.  But, it looks more appealing as a heading to me.  Of course,
    I don't have all the weights available, so I couldn't give a fully informed opinion
    on body text.  \r\n\r\nIs there an article anyone knows of (besides the ones I'll
    find googling in the next few minutes) that can explain how the eye recognizes
    letter shapes and the mechanics behind that?  That'd be fantastic.  Very grateful
