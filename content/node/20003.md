  body: "I like the visual pun... but because its outline, I think it might not transmit
    well via fax. And at smaller sizes on the web you can expects lots of problems.
    Outlines are typically not very study in these environments.\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "I second Mikey's comment, but also - how come the straw disappears when the
    bottom of the glass is visible? Surely the stem of the i/straw would be shown?\r\n\r\nIt's
    not a bad thing to bear in mind the limitations of having outlines - as said above,
    it won't look quite the same when faxed/photocopied, and won't look too hot at
    a small size - this will be the case on letterheads, forms etc., that you would
    create as part of a stationery suite for the company.\r\n\r\nNice idea though,
    it made me smile.\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "Tell us more about the company do they work in the drinks sector or are they
    heavy drinkers and how, where the logo is supposed to perform. Why is the bottom
    of the i not visible in the glass when the bottom is?\r\nTim\r\n{edit sorry, bit
    of a crosspost, I didn't mean to repeat what was previously said}"

  body: The idea behind the company is that it is a mix of media production.  It could
    be called media stew but I thought drink sounded better.  The other thing is a
    lot of media that is produced can be boring or repeated a drink is kind of a symbol
    of refreshment so hopefully people will think the company provides fresh ideas.  Thanks
    for the feedback I agree completely here is a revision and I think it is an improvement.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/media-drink-black_5986.jpg]

  body: "I like the new solid version. All you need is perhaps show the i through
    the glass... I'm not sure, try it and see if you like it.\r\n\r\nAnd also perhaps
    nudge the cup over a little to the left- closer to the d.\r\n\r\nGreat Work,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "The ri needs some adjustment, you could cut the arm of the r and/or reduce
    the serif on the i; the dots on the i are grabbing attention; I find the m much
    too condensed. The glass isn't really saying refreshing, perhaps a taller glass
    with some indication of liquid/ice cubes would help, I also think you are going
    to have problems with the weight of the stroke in reproduction but equally you
    don't want it to overwhelm the lettering. As a thought you could create the logo
    in two lines with the glass/straw device taking the place of both i's (I really
    don't know if that will work).\r\nTim"

  body: "I like the underlying concept, I think the name is interesting (in a good
    way), but I really think you're asking for problems with the thin stroke weight
    on the glass (the lettering is also very thin, it might look very fiddly at a
    small size). Maybe widen your idea around the drink idea - maybe look at more
    than a glass, off the top of my head you could possibly use a slice of lemon/lime
    that you'd find in a cool drink - the fruit would also suggest freshness, and
    the associated yellow/green would back this up. Just a thought, I'm sure there
    are lots of other drink related objects you could make use of.\r\n\r\nSi"
