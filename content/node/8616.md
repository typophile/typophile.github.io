body: Hello out there in typophile land, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m wondering if anyone knows
  how to display OpenType fonts in a web and/ or interactive application. <BR> <BR>Basically,
  I need to create an environment where I can exhibit multiple OpenType features on
  a font. I want a user to be able to type in a sentence, click a button, and be dazzled
  by lovely OT features. <BR> <BR>This is for my MFA thesis exhibition, a purely academic,
  non-commercial project...for now... <BR> <BR>Am I asking the impossible? <BR> <BR>Thanks
  in advance! <BR> <BR>amy

  body: thanks for these suggestions...i&#39;ve got to do some research to figure
    out if either of these are possibilities for what I want to do...this is a project
    that requires someone to &#34;experience&#34; the font &#40;by actually typing&#41;
    rather than &#34;see&#34; it...and i&#39;d prefer if the environment was not InDesign
    or Illustrator, too many other distractions... <BR> <BR>i&#39;ll post if either
    of these suggestions work. <BR>best, <BR>amy
