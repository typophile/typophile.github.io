  Mill Goudy | http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sorts-mill-goudy]] and they
  seem identical to me no matter how hard I look. Is there some way to compare faces
  beyond simply eyeballing?

    that most people simply don't notice.  Also, I find it helps a lot to actually
    print out a sample of text (on the same printer) in both fonts that you're comparing.\r\n\r\nAs
    one example, compare an enlargement of the uppercase 'M' in Sorts Mill's versus
    Monotype's.  The ends of the serifs on the baseline taper down and are more rounded
    off in the Monotype version - Sorts Mill has a subtle concavity on top, ending
    in a slightly more squarish shape.  You can see something similar in the lowercase
    'l'.  Details like this are invisible to the untrained eye, and even to the trained
    eye at smallish sizes typical in text... and yet they still make a subtle, subconscious
    difference in the overall look of the text.\r\n\r\nToo, there are differences
    that have nothing to do with the letter shapes themselves.  Letter spacing, contrast
    of upper-to-lowercase characters, positioning of diacritics, kerning, etc.  These
    are just as much aspects of the font's design and \"character\" as the individual
    glyphs.  For instance, if I look at the same text printed off in both Monotype
    Centaur and Bitstream Venetian 301, I find the latter looks rather ragged and
    homely compared to the former, even though each letter is pretty much identical
    in shape.  (And neither is a patch on the original metal type in my opinion, but
    that's a story for another day...)"
