body: Hello everyone, i am a graphic design student in my 3rd and final year, and
  currently writing my dissertation. <BR>My dissertation is on the current trend of
  hand rendered typography over more traditional typefaces and looking into how well
  this style communicates.  <BR>I hear there is an article in raygun composed by mr
  Carson which has been set entirely in webdings. I have been searching for this article
  for a long time now, and wonder if anyone could tell me if indeed it does exist,
  and if so in which edition.  <BR>This would be most helpful in one of my chapters
  on how the motivation of the audience helps in determining the readability of a
  piece. <BR>any help would be greatfully recieved.

  body: 'Point of information: while some people, especially native English-speaking
    typographers it seems, have taken to distinguishing between legibility and readability,
    this seems an anomaly, both professionally and linguistically. As I discovered
    when moderating the legibility panel discussion in Thessaloniki this summer, cognitive
    psychologists studying reading do not generally make a distinction between legibility
    and readability. If they do make a distinction, it is not the same as that made
    by typographers. So while we, as typographers, might use &#39;legibility&#39;
    to refer to letter decipherment and &#39;readability&#39; to refer to word recognition,
    a cognitive psychologist might make no distinction, or might reserve the term
    readability to refer to document-level phenomena such as page layout, structure
    and even prose style. Many languages do not offer even a vocabulary distinction
    for legibility versus readability. <BR> <BR>I think it would be a good thing for
    typographers to recognise that the distinction we&#39;ve taken to making between
    legibility and readability is really begging the question: the distinction itself
    assumes that letter decipherment and word recognition are somehow separate and
    only the latter constitutes reading. No cognitive scientist is going to accept
    such a loaded distinction, since empirical studies are at best inconclusive and
    tend, in fact, to link letter recognition and word recognition very closely.'

  body: Your dissertation sounds interesting, but I&#39;d agree with John. <BR>He&#39;s
    summed up what I&#39;ve been sensing for a while now. It  <BR>seems to me that
    any differences between legibility and  <BR>readability are purely academic, because
    in practice you can&#39;t  <BR>have one without the other or vice versa. <BR>
    <BR>But don&#39;t let that deter you from exploring hand-written  <BR>communication
    and audience motivation &#40;as you put it&#41;, etc.  <BR> <BR>When it comes
    to Carson, though, admire his guts and his risk- <BR>taking, but just don&#39;t
    put him or Ray-gun readers too high on  <BR>any pedastals. It was interesting
    work at the time, but I have to <BR>imagine that readers did exactly what I did
    when I came across <BR>that article... I said, this looks like crap, but it&#39;s
    sure gutsy. And  <BR>then skipped past it to the next spread. <BR> <BR>There are
    so many interesting areas you could look at, like  <BR>blackletter and uncial,
    etc. Best of luck.

  body: Hi Daniel <BR> <BR>The RayGun artcle you mentioned was at least eight years
    ago &#40;so Iam not sure how relevant it is to current design trends&#41;. It
    seemed a pretty pointless exercise at the time, speaking as a reader of the magazine.
    <BR> <BR>But that article in RayGun is probably a good example of why legible
    type is in no danger of being written off. Ask yourself why was the whole magazine
    not set in webdings, every month! <BR> <BR>Because as a consumer you would go
    up to the magazine stand and say, I am not paying $8 for some pictures and some
    text which doesn&#39;t mean anything, even if it is designed by David Carson.  <BR>
    <BR>Design is all about communication, and while a hard to read display font,
    or piece of hand lettering may be funky for a magazine headline, the body text
    has to communicate with the reader clearly.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d suggest that you
    research th other side of the arguement, for example... if distressed looking
    type is so popular and trendy, why are the classic fonts the most popular &#40;looking
    at sales figures&#41;. Why are companies like Sea Design &#40; <a href="http://www.seadesign.co.uk"
    target="_blank">http://www.seadesign.co.uk</a> &#41; and Browns &#40; <a href="http://www.brownsdesign.co.uk"
    target="_blank">http://www.brownsdesign.co.uk</a> &#41; in design magazines every
    month, and winning all the top awards &#40;in the UK where I see you are&#41;
    with clean helvetica based work if this isn&#39;t popular, and why are newspaper
    typefaces so conservative if readers love hard to read text? <BR> <BR>Please keep
    us posted on your progress, as I am sure lots of us would love to read the finished

    studying reading do not generally <BR>&#62; make a distinction between legibility
    and readability. <BR> <BR>And that of course is the biggest clue that they don&#39;t
    know what they&#39;re talking about!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s notable that the
    cognitive psychologists in Thessaloniki did nothing to change Richard Southall&#39;s
    mind, a person who is certainly not anti-empirical. The bulk of empirical research
    into readability is essentially flawed. If the scientists want to make a dent
    into reality, they have to explain various things, such as the importance of serifs,
    tight letterspacing, etc. They have not. And if they keep following this course,
    they never will. <BR> <BR>The difference between readability and legibility is
    parallel to the difference between a type designer who makes real text fonts versus
    versus a designer who is simply very good at faking it. <BR> <BR>hhp

    on the differences between the way we write and what we read. Most are taught
    not to use the two-story &#39;a&#39; etc. Cursives are even more extreme in their
    differences. <BR> <BR>If what we read often affects our ability to read then how
    we write must also hold some bearing. Typography has been a largely male dominated
    business, but women--in my experience--have much better handwriting. Of course
    that doesn&#39;t have much to do with why it&#39;s male dominated, but does the
    ability to write well influence reading? If you have horrible handwriting, it
    stands that you&#39;d have an easier time reading badly kerned or misshapen type.
    <BR> <BR>Just something I&#39;ve been pondering. I don&#39;t know of any studies.

    separate to some degree. I have seen in I forget which book how you can slow down

  body: William, the model of word recognition that Kevin Larson describes is one
    in which word-identity is guessed at in the brain based on all available information
    and, particularly, the simultaneous identification of the letters in the word.
    Obviously, if you fragment words by excessive or inconsistent letterspacing, then
    you break whatever model of word recognition you are working with, but this doesn&#39;t
    imply that the letter-recognition -&#62; word-recognition model is inadequate,
    because obviously the key to word-recognition would be <i>letters in a word</i>.
    If you can&#39;t easily tell where a word begins or ends, letter recognition isn&#39;t
    going to function as it should as part of word recognition. <BR> <BR>Studies on
    the phenomenon of lateral masking on letter recognition are interesting in this
    regard, because they suggest how letter spacing -- and form -- affect the ability
    to recognise individual letters. The basic phenomenon is that letters in the parafovea
    are easier to recognise in isolation than when sandwiched between other letters;
    the effect of the other letters is called lateral masking. What is interesting
    is that there is a totally unintuitive improvement in letter recognition when
    parts of the letters actually touch, which Peter Enneson, for one, thinks may
    contribute to an understanding of the value of serifs, as elements that make connections
    between letters. <BR> <BR>One of the results of the legibility panel in Thessaloniki
    is that Kevin is now very interested in the matter of letter spacing, and is beginning
    to test specifically in this area. I&#39;ve talked with him a little bit about
    his initial results, but I don&#39;t want to steal his thunder so will let him
    make his findings public when he is ready.

    You are conceding that there is more to readibility than letter recognition. That
    estabilishes the distinction. The question is, then, how important is the distinction?  <BR>
    <BR>The model of parallel processing sounds right, but it does not contradict
    the importance of additional factors in reading beyond legibility of individual
    letters. For example the masking stuff you refer to and the spacing both have
    to do with we recognize words, how words are recognized apart from simply being
    able to quickly identify individual letters.  <BR> <BR>So I think the new research
    you cite - and it looks like Larson has learned of the importance of new problems
    from type designers - seems to support the importance of the distinction that
    typographers have long made.'

    irrelevant, he candidly said No. And I&#39;m with him. And so are many others.
    But not because we reject empiricism; it&#39;s because we reject <i>deficient

  body: 'Hrant, I&#39;m just reporting, as correctly as I&#39;m able, the opposing
    viewpoint. I&#39;m not concerned with how people make their decisions, but I am
    concerned that people make assumptions and encode those assumptions into their
    language. Making a distinction between legibility and readability along the lines
    we have done so in recent years now seems to me presumptuous. Sure, it may be
    useful and it may even turn out to be correct, but you can&#39;t expect any scientist
    to accept such an a priori assumption. Science is slow and takes a long time to
    come to a conclusion. Jumping to conclusions is obviously quicker. When we have
    to select a typeface for a project and decide whether it is appropriately spaced,
    we <i>must</i> jump to a conclusion, based on intuition, experience, etc. But
    this is a different process from accurately determining how we read. I wouldn&#39;t
    base a decision about typeface use on partial empirical understanding of how we
    read, but nor would I base a theory of how we read on intuition and anecdotal
    typographic evidence. <BR> <BR><i>...humans are not algorithmic</i> <BR> <BR>This
    seems to relate to something I said to Peter Enneson in Thessaloniki. The parallel
    letter recognition model seems to offend some people because it seems algorithmic;
    certainly, it doesn&#39;t seem holistic. And we like to think that we&#39;re oh
    so holistic, because that is how we experience thought. But all evidence of brain
    activity points to a crude, algorithmic device that gets by on sheer processing
    power: leaving us with the uncomfortable notion that what we experience as holistic
    may actually be the product of a massively complex algorithmic machine. The holistic
    appearance of thought may, in fact, be a function of the complexity. This is to
    what I was referring in my chess game metaphor at Thessaloniki: the experience
    of reading differs from the mechanics of reading. This raises all sorts of interesting
    questions. To what degree is the experience of reading directly addressable via
    the mechanics of reading? <BR> <BR>Imagine, for example, that you changed the
    rules of chess to insert an element of chance into the game. For instance, the
    players would flip a coin that would determine which of them would miss his third
    move. Suddenly, chess would no longer be a function: it would become a game. But
    since we don&#39;t experience chess as a function anyway -- we experience it as
    a game --, such mechanical tinkering doesn&#39;t significantly affect our experience.
    <BR> <BR>Likewise, it seems to me, that whether one accepts the parallel letter
    recognition or Hrant&#39;s bouma theory of reading -- or produces evidence of
    some other mechanism -- it isn&#39;t obvious that this choice, <i>or type design
    practices arising from it,</i> will significantly affect the experience of reading.
    And it is this, I think, that Richard Southall was acknowledging. Type designers
    and typographers are predominantly interested in the experience of reading. So
    when Richard told Kevin that he would not necessarily adapt his design practices
    to empirical evidence suggesting that loose letterspacing improved readability,
    one must also assume that he would not necessarily adapt his design practices
    to Hrant&#39;s recommendations based upon the bouma theory.'

    are separate activities. <BR> <BR>John, you seem to be assuming that the distinction
    is based on the extreme view that &#39;bouma&#39; or word shape is everything,
    which has been refuted by the examples recently discussed of mixing letters within
    words.  <BR> <BR>But your understanding on the usage of these terms I think is
    not correct, at least historically. For example, here is the distinction as explained
    in my late Uncle J. Ben Lieberman&#39;s book &#39;Types of Typefaces&#39; &#40;1967&#41;:
    <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR>&#34;Legibility&#34; is based on the ease with which
    one letter can be told from another.  <BR>[Here follows a graphic with b&#39;s
    and h&#39;s, including the old style italic h, which can be confused with a b].  <BR>
    <BR>&#34;Readibility&#34; is the ease with which the eye can absorb the message
    and move along the line. The choice of typeface is not the only thing that determines
    readibility. The size of the letter, the spacing between letters, the amount of
    &#34;leading&#34; &#40;spacing&#41; between lines, the width of the line itself,
    the size of the margins around the type block, the quality of inking, the effect
    of the process used - including the amound of &#34;sock&#34; [in letterpress]
    the texture or finish of the paper stock, the color of the paper and ink - all
    these are involved, both in affecting the appearance of the particular typefaced
    used and in the resulting readibility. <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>I should add
    that Ben Lieberman was in contact with the leading lights of his day in the type
    world, so this definition almost certainly reflects widespread practice in the
    type world. So we are talking about usage that probably dates back to at least
    the 1930s.  <BR> <BR>This definition does not make any prejudgments about the
    relative importance and exact role of disciphering individual letters verses whole
    words. It just says that there is more to readibility than distinguishing quickly
    individual letters.  <BR> <BR>Furthermore, it does seem to me from the discussions
    here on Typophile - I don&#39;t know the literature - that psychological research
    on these additional factors beyond letter discipherment has been rather neglected.  <BR>
    <BR>As irritating as I find Hrant&#39;s extreme and insulting way of putting it,
    I think he has a sound point that a lot of research remains to be done to enlighten
    us on these additional factors. I do agree with you, and not with Hrant, in thinking
    that in the end these results are not likely to affect normal typographic practice
    or speed of comprehension very much.  <BR> <BR>By the way, I would like to split
    further readibility as defined by Lieberman. There is one aspect of readibility
    which is reading speed and comprehension, and another which is comfort. I may
    be able to read a paragraph on screen as fast and with as much comprehension as
    a printed version. But it is common knowledge that it is more fatiguing to read
    low resolution screens, and that if you want to proof read something, you&#39;d
    better print it out. The degree to which a setting is welcoming and comfortable
    to read it seems to me is extremely important to typography, beyond legibility
    or readibility. And it, too, could be studied scientifically.'

    <BR>Well they&#39;re obviously not the <i>same</i>, since one can comfortably

    I&#39;m questioning whether it should be, and to what degree it represents an

    do not provide vocabulary for such a distinction. When Gerard Unger writes or
    lectures about what we would term &#39;readability&#39; in type design, according

    &#39;legibility&#39; since this is the common translation of the Dutch word he
    uses. <BR> <BR>And as I discovered in Thessaloniki, our friends in cognitive psychology

  body: Would most people consider a script font such as Zapfino legible?  Readable?  IMO
    it&#39;s not terribly readable, and I would be loath to read a book written in
    it.  I do think it&#39;s quite legible in that individual letters and even words
    are easily decoded, and I am confident it <i>would</i> become readable with practice.  &#40;And
    Zapfino would be more readable than, say, P22 Cezanne, but I don&#39;t find either
    one illegible.&#41; <BR> <BR>Double ditto with Comic Sans MS, which has been used
    by far too many half-crazed office weasels to encode lengthy memos.  It is entirely
    legible, but not eminently readable--especially when printed at 75dpi without
    antialiasing.  &#40;Despite plenty of practice I never did become entirely comfortable
    reading it.&#41; <BR> <BR>I believe there is a useful distinction between the
    two terms, but I also strongly agree they need to be scientifically defined. Such
    studies will add value to typography, if for no other reason than to better describe
    the limits of art versus practical usability.  &#40;And if it helps to suppress
    lousy office memos, I&#39;m all for it.&#41; <BR> <BR>I would go so far as to
    say that illegibility does not preclude readability!  I suspect many of us have
    known husbands and wives where the husband could <i>read</i> his wife&#39;s writing
    so long as he &#34;knew what it said&#34;, but the writing was so inherently illegible
    that it precluded reading unfamiliar words, telephone numbers, etc. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    an extreme example, and not everyone would agree with that particular definition;
    yet I feel that is still a useful distinction to be made.  Other examples might
    include bad bitmap fonts, low-resolution LED/LCD displays, or printouts from 8-pin
    dot-matrix printers.  All of these may be easily &#34;decodable&#34; &#40;which
    may be a better term than legible&#41; but not necessarily easily read.  Any of
    these may become more readable with practice, but that&#39;s equally useful information
    to know. <BR> <BR>I can imagine situations which might necessitate an unreadable
    but legible font, like when many similar figures are being displayed and it&#39;s
    important that each one is distinctly noted and checked. <BR> <BR>So, here&#39;s
    a bold definition with testable hypotheses.  Legibility is how quickly an individual
    letter or word may be decoded; readability is the amount of practice required
    to learn to &#34;read at full speed&#34; without strain, and may include a herd
    of relevant factors such as type size and spacing.  Both of these can be measured,
    although the latter is enormously more difficult than the former to quantify.  &#40;Those
    dratted test subjects have a nasty habit of learning without telling you.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>As far as I can tell, the cognitive psychologists can&#39;t even definitively
    state there are different modes of reading or what the distinctions are--let alone
    determine if glyph-level or word-level legibility is a separate issue from ease
    of reading.

    one of his more important contributions to the philosophy of science. Popper proposed
    that every good theory should be falsifiable. Basically, that it&#39;s possible
    to run an empirical test that could show the theory to be wrong. For example the
    parallel letter recognition model predicts that longer words &#40;words with more
    letters&#41; will take longer to recognize than shorter words because of the additional
    computation of putting together more letters. If we ran a test and found that
    long words are recognized faster, then the parallel letter recognition model would
    be proven false. A theory like creationism is a poor one because there is no test
    that can ever demonstrate the theory to be wrong. I would likewise put many of
    Freud&#39;s theories into the same category. <BR> <BR>What tests can we run that
    would falsify the bouma model? <BR> <BR>Cheers, Kevin

  body: 'Kevin, yes it was a gratifying and unforgetable experience being around a
    truly great thinker. In my highly biassed opinion the best book on Popper&#39;s
    relevance to cognitive psychology is &#39;Learning from Error&#39;, which I wrote
    with John Wettersten. The first half, which mainly I wrote, is on Popper and cognitive
    psychology.  <BR> <BR>Thinking back on those days brings back to mind one of the
    many things he said that stuck in my mind at the time - &#39;file for later reflection&#39;
    - that may be relevant to your work. He said he thought that the periodic reversal
    in the necker cube optical illusion was due to the mind raplidly trying out hypotheses
    to interpret the incoming data, and then refuting them and trying another, and
    refuting it. The necker cube causes an unusual &#39;loop&#39; in the process.
    I&#39;m sure Popper would say that some kind of rapid testing process is involved
    in identifying words. <BR> <BR>The bouma model in its more extreme form - that
    word shape is much more important than individual letters is refutable and refuted.
    As I mentioned earlier, the research mentioned in the letter reversal discussion
    here showed that: you can mix letters in a word and still read quickly. So the
    more extreme form is dead.  <BR> <BR>It is important to understand here, I think,
    that models in the vague sense of an idea that guides research are not testable.
    For example the continuous vs atomic views of reality are still vying with one
    another after several hundred years. As Popper emphasized, what are testable are
    theories. <BR> <BR>A model that is a heuristic idea like &#39;you can explain
    reading in terms of word shapes&#39; is too vague to be testable, even though
    it can inspire testable theories. Some of Popper&#39;s followers, such as Agassi
    &#40;whom I was also a student of&#41; made clear that both research programs,
    inspired by &#39;models&#39; and other things, and testable theories are important
    in the growth of science. But when it comes to evaluation you can only empirically
    evaluate theories, and only indirectly research programs, by whether they are
    fruitful or not of new discoveries.  <BR> <BR>As Thomas mentions, the most informative
    tests are &#39;crucial experiments&#39; that will discriminate between two competing
    theories. But both theories must be testable to be so tested.  <BR> <BR>As Agassi
    pointed out, there is a danger in not distinguishing between research programs
    and theories. You can always cite confirmations of research programs, but experiements
    are only scientifically significant when they are potential refutation of theories.  <BR>
    <BR>On the &#39;bouma&#39; model, those who are partisans of that research program
    should come up with theories to test. But no, it is better for anyone researching
    to come up with testable versions of theories they disagree with, as well as agree
    with, so they can do crucial experiments.  <BR> <BR>Personally, I think there
    is more to word recognition than letter recognition, but the challenge is to put
    forward alternative theories on what that &#39;more&#39; is, and then to test
    them.  <BR> <BR>The discussion on emotion vs reason and marriage decisions is
    something I have written about, but I really don&#39;t want to get into it as
    I will be hours writing out the whole issue - and not exactly relevant here.  <BR>
    <BR>I will just mention though that a lot of the evolution debate is muddied by
    a failure to distinguish between testable theories and research programs - evolution
    &#39;theory&#39; involves both.'

    I couldn&#39;t reasonably ask more than for you to assume boumas exist simply
    to try to prove they don&#39;t. <BR> <BR>The big obstacle -and I really don&#39;t
    mean to give anybody an impossible task, I really like empircism, if only for
    what it can do- is that the scientific methods used &#40;not just by you&#41;
    simply can&#39;t get there from here. Like I said it&#39;s great that you&#39;re
    looking into the effects of letterspacing, but as long as you&#39;re not promoting
    deep immersion you&#39;re never going to get any data that refutes your model,
    because your model is sound for deliberative reading. All you&#39;ll see is little
    blips of strangeness like short and frequent words being skipped more or less
    - not enough to shake you from your position, not enough to give Doubt real steam.
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; Hrant has not suggested anything himself. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    hard. I&#39;ve always said that. It&#39;s the PL people claiming they&#39;ve &#34;arrived&#34;,
    thanks to their shiny computers. <BR> <BR>I can think of a few things though,
    but the basic thing -again- is implementing a fundamental change in the way data
    is collected. As I suggested to Kevin in Thessaloniki &#40;and people like Kinross
    have always maintained this&#41; you can&#39;t really measure reading by attaching
    devices to people at some exact distance from some exact screen, and tell them
    they&#39;re guinea pigs. They&#39;ll never read naturally that way. That&#39;s
    why Kevin&#39;s data shows such low reading speeds for example. <BR> <BR>What
    I&#39;ve suggested to Kevin is this: get avid readers in their 40s or so, pay
    them to sign a consent form allowing you to: provide them with reading material&#42;,
    and secretly observe their reading at any time during let&#39;s say a one year
    span; then if you get enough data about reading times, you&#39;ll see all the
    boumas come out of the woodwork, like little spirits lurking on the page, waiting
    for people not to look. I promise. <BR> <BR>&#42; Maybe books of their choice
    but re-typeset in certain ways. Like a string of chapters with tight spacing and
    a string with loose. <BR> <BR>The big problem is that entails a <i>lot</i> of
    funding. The good news -and the final piece of the puzzle which makes me excited
    to have Kevin around- is that MS is filthy rich. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; Our
    feelings are submitted to rational judgement <BR> <BR>John, you can&#39;t seriously
    think that everybody feels this way. There&#39;s something called Intuition, and
    it&#39;s not the same thing as Reason. Or maybe you could say it&#39;s a Reason
    of the Subconscious. But that&#39;s totally different than Logic. <BR> <BR>--
    <BR> <BR>William, that was a great post. <BR> <BR>To try to clarify what the bouma
    model in <i>my</i> head is, it certainly doesn&#39;t say we read whole-word shapes
    all the time. That&#39;s nuts. It simply says that the brain uses as much as it
    can as fast as it can. So for example when it sees some totally clear letters
    in the fovea, it compiles them in parallel into words. This is Kevin&#39;s stuff.
    Here boumas are single letters. But it also says that the brain takes &#34;educated
    guesses&#34; about blurry clusters of letters some way off to the right of fixation
    &#40;notably where individual letters are undecipherable, even if you give a reader
    extra time to consider the shape consciously - in fact consciousness might actually
    be an <i>obstacle</i> there&#41;. It can do this if the cluster &#40;maybe a word,
    maybe a part of a word&#41; is crisp, frequent and distinctive enough for the
    given experience of the reader at hand to have enough faith &#40;never certainty&#41;
    to consider it read. This is why typos are missed so much. This is heuristics.
    And yes, it makes empiricists quiver. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    a hypothesis on word recognition, but I don&#39;t remember exactly what it was.
    I think it was related to an ideal range for letter spacing. Maybe you, Kevin,
    are testing this and other ideas, from what John says. I &#40;as others&#41; also
    believe that serifs help the eye identify and hold a distinct line of text, which
    is why serif texts need less leading. I think there is a lot more...

    then serifs &#40;if they&#39;re long enough&#41; can help out a little, but I
    think by then you&#39;d have totally trashed decent readability anyway, because
    word spaces &#40;which have to be a certain minimum size themselves, serifs or
    no&#41; will overpower the leading. <BR> <BR>Coming back to &#34;my&#34; model,
    I just wanted to add this: <BR>It&#39;s the model that assimilates everything
    I&#39;ve encountered since starting this research in &#39;98, including all the
    empirical data I&#39;ve seen &#40;in the context of validity&#41;, all the anecdotal
    evidence, plus beliefs about human thought. What choice do I have but to believe
    it? Just ask yourselves, what is more probable: that the empirical data that points
    to the PL model is essentially limited to deliberation &#40;or very light immersion&#41;,
    or that virtually all the anecdotal evidence &#40;that a book set in sans is a
    more laborious read, that there&#39;s such a thing as a too-big x-height, etc.&#41;
    is totally wrong? A big problem with Formal Science is its tendency to treat anecdotal
    evidence as Old Wives Tales. There has to be more give-and-take, on both sides.

  body: '&#62;differences between serif and san serif fonts <BR> <BR>Did Lund test
    or review tests including the variables of line length and leading? <BR> <BR>The
    common view in typography is that sans serifs, in order to be easily readible
    need shorter lines and/or more leading compared to serif fonts.  <BR> <BR>Thus
    I would guess that under some conditions sans are equally readable, but under
    others - longer lines, less leading - serifs would be superior. In particular,
    I would expect that people would take more time finding the next line - or lose
    their place within a line as well - with longer lines and less leading with a
    sans.   <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad to be in such good company as Bringhurst on the
    importance of the relationship between counters and spacing! <BR> <BR>I suspect
    that serifs also help ease of identifying a word as a word. &#40;this should probably
    show up in reading speed&#41; This is complicated by the spacing issue. Sans are
    often more tightly spaced. This would help identify what is a word, but then &#40;if
    Bringhurst and I are right&#41; the spacing would be less than ideal, and that
    would affect reading. This is why I think that narrow sans like Meta and Vesta
    are more readable &#40;and likely more rapidly read&#41; than the very round and
    tight Helvetica. -The ratios between stem spacing, counters and tightness of letter
    vs word spacing work better. With serifs the spacing between stems can be looser
    &#40;and better&#41; but the word still be quickly identifiable as a word because
    the serifs are linking the letters visually.  <BR> <BR>By the way, absolute size
    is also important I think. You can put tight spacing big on the side of a building
    and it won&#39;t slow you down. But at 8 point it will matter a lot. <BR> <BR>All
    this &#40;except the bit about counters which I hadn&#39;t heard before and on
    which Bringhurst concurs&#41; is common wisdom. It should be testable, but you

  body: '<i>The letterspacing angle is a much more robust test of PL versus bouma.</i>
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t see how. What letterspace testing will do is identify something
    like optimal letterspacing, but unless this result is extreme in some way, it
    won&#39;t tell us much about the reading process itself. If optimal letterspacing
    turns out to be roughly what typographers judge to be &#39;correct&#39;, all it
    will tell us is what we already know: people can read typical typesetting. I think
    you are assuming a theoretical benefit to the parallel letter recognition from
    looser letterspacing, and I think that theory is something worth testing, but
    I don&#39;t think we can conclude that this is a fact. As Kevin has pointed out
    before, the parallel letter recognition model is a <i>word recognition</i> model;
    we still don&#39;t know how people recognise letters. So we can&#39;t assume that
    letter recognition benefits from loose letterspacing, or that bouma recognition
    benefits from tight letterspacing. These are inductive inferences, but as I noted,
    some of the studies on lateral masking produced unintuitive results. We can&#39;t
    rely on inductive reasoning. <BR> <BR>William has already demonstrated, easily
    enough, that letter spacing that is obviously too loose and is in c o n s is t
    e n t makes reading difficult, but as I noted this is because such spacing breaks
    up words. But this doesn&#39;t imply anything about how we recognise specific
    words, only about how we recognise that something is a word in the first place.
    The parallel letter recognition theory is based on recognising letters that make
    up a word; determining that something is a word is a prerequisite for identifying
    the word. It seems to me that in order to test the bouma theory one would need
    find a way to inhibit letter recognition while not inhibiting letter-group recognition,
    and then see what impact this has on reading speed and accuracy. This might, in
    fact, be possible by spacing the letters so tightly, even overlapping them partly.
    But one would need first, of course, to confirm the impact of such spacing on
    letter recognition itself, e.g. by having people try to identify letters in non-word
    sequences. Before one can know that one is, in fact, testing bouma recognition,
    one needs to remove the possibility of individual letter recognition from the
    test as far as possible.'
