    both from [[http://www.typography.com|H&FJ]].'

  body: Nope. The caps are <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/bold-condensed/">Akzidenz
    Grotesk Condensed Bold</a>. Not nice enough to be from H&FJ.

  body: Yeah, the middle bar of the E is shorter in Knockout, but at this size they
    otherwise look pretty much the same. And I don't know why I thought that was Mercury

  body: The serif indeed looks like Adobe Caslon. I think that's it, though it's probably
    been a <em>tiny</em> bit [[squooshed]].
