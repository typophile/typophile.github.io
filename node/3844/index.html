Mediterranean cuisine in general is the best. Fortunately LA has a lot of good restaurants from every culture. Greek fonts: I think non-Greeks did a lot of damage in the past (like Porson, and even Aldus), but in the computer age the Greeks themselves made things worse.

I stay in Thessaloniki and I took part in the conference, so we may met.  <BR> <BR>I agree with you that the &quot;latinized&quot; of greek letters by various non-greeks made damage (to me the most horrible example was Van Krimpen's &quot;Romulus&quot;, but I like Porson's types).  <BR> <BR>I guess, you propably know Yorgos Matthiopoulos and the Greek Fonts Society. People like Yorgos and Klimis Mastorides are our hopes for this  renaissance you mention&hellip;but to be honnest, maybe 1 in 10 graphic designers in Greece really care about the identity of the form of the greek letters, not to say that adjusting the forms of latin fonts seems ideal to them&hellip;and that's why I think Matthiew Carter is one of the great designers of our times, but he did make damage in the development of the greek design identity.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">(From pumpkins to Porson&hellip; Isn't the internet amazing?) <BR> <BR>I was only at the conference the day I was on. Your town simply had too much to offer! <BR> <BR>Romulus was indeed a monster, but even in this age of (supposed) cultural sensitivity it has admirers. And it's interesting to note that some of our best Latin designers made some of the worst non-Latin fonts. Why is this? I think the reason is pride, a dangerous two-edged sword: it motivates creativity in what's your own, but also causes you to look down on what isn't. <BR> <BR>The problem I see with Porson is one of my main contentions with the whole of western philosophy, and its love of simplification; humans are not simple things - ligatures are *useful*. Plus the one thing he should have &quot;simplified&quot; (removing the slant that Aldus so wrongly implemented), he didn't. <BR> <BR>There seems to be a lot of Greek type designers these days, but my acquaintance with them is as limited as my understanding of the script. That said, the person who has so far impressed me the most on the ground is Katsoulidis; there's also Gerry Leonidas, who has great depth of knowledge. <BR> <BR>As for most Greeks not caring, yes, it's a problem, since change comes quickest when people have awareness. But as long as there's less people who favor Latinized type than those who want to return to authenticity, that's not so bad. In the 70s, when Carter was making those Latinized fonts, he was following the direct wishes of his Greek clients. He really couldn't have said &quot;shame on you for betraying your culture&quot;&hellip; Who wants to become a martyr for somebody else's culture? (Well, I guess the idle bourgeoisie does, with their &quot;Free Tibet&quot; bumper stickers&hellip;) I think it's a very high reflection on Carter that he had enough of a reaction to the cultural bankruptcy of his Greek clients to make Cadmus (and then Skia). <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

In a textbook Modernist manner*, he banished ligatures from Greek, in the naive desire to make it easier to read.

		<div class="commentbody">In Britain, Porson may be seen as the turning point in the sense that before his new type almost all Greek set in Britain used the Aldine style, with or without diacritics. On the continent, the Didot romantic style had already spread rapidly, and this too was generally set without ligatures. But I think the absence of ligatures in both these styles needs to be seen as a response to the decline in the use of ligatures that had preceded their development. <BR> <BR>It should be noted that the Porsonic style remained an almost purely British phenomenon: it was never takem up on the continent, nor in Greece.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scholderer's New Hellenic is definitely not Porsonic. New Hellenic refers back to the Complutensian Greek and other pre-Aldine styles, a development that began with Robert Proctor's Otter type. Proctor's <i>The printing of Greek in the fifteenth century</i> had a big influence on Scholderer. <BR> <BR>The Porsonic style is very distinct from the later developments of Proctor and Scholderer. Like the Aldine style, the Porsonic has upright caps and slanted lowercase. The most distinctive characteristic of the style are the lunate epsilon and the very round, full alpha. The Porsonic style is a kind of hybrid of the Aldine and Romantic styles but simplified and regularised. It looks like what it is: Richard Porson's meticulously neat Greek handwriting, which North Americans would call 'printing' because with few exceptions the letters do not join up.</div>
