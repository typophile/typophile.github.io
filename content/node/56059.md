  students posts. What a great learning experience for all involved! We never imagined
  how much this would engage our students and push them to respond, react, think and
  be passionate about typography and design! (Our classroom discussions have been
  quite lively.)\r\n\r\nAlthough New Orleans is an interesting and diverse city, it
  is somewhat sheltered from the current contemporary design/type mainstream due in
  some part to Katrina and in some part to being in the gulf coast. As faculty, it's
  our job to expose the students to new and different forums that are more easily
  experienced in a larger metro area (ie: NYC, Chicago, LA), this is in part the reason
  we decided to require our students to create a blog on Typophile. We chose Typophile
  because we respected the level of information being shared and discussed. \r\n\r\nWe
  recognize our role in our students' lives as being somewhat limited, in the sense
  that we are all they get for 4 yrs. It felt as though we needed to encourage them
  to put their work out in the community and get \"real time\" feedback, no matter
  how harsh that feedback might be. That is part of the pedagogy of our teaching.
  We do give them assignments and state what we are looking for specifically, but
  the students are ultimately the ones in charge of how they post their findings.
  We do not create assignments that are unfounded or without purpose, just as people
  who post or reply to threads on Typophile don't do it just for the sake of taking
  up air time (we hope). We think the reality is that some students (just as professionals)
  will post because they \"need\" to (whatever the reason, a grade or filling up space,
  or really wanting to share ideas/thoughts/projects).\r\n\r\nWe stress to our students
  that design is so much more than just making and sitting in front of the computer,
  it's also about thinking, writing, speaking, critiquing. We are so proud of our
  students for putting themselves out there (for better or worse). We should also
  note that many of our students have ended up in the \"hottest\" or \"hand picked\"
  areas of the site. \r\n\r\nDiscussions are in progress with the Typophile team.
  \r\n\r\nThank you to all the students who have participated with this conversation.
  We commend you for your passion and fortitude. And, don't forget, your next blog
  is due on Sunday at 5pm. "
