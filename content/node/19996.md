  whitenoise and usually doesn't disrupt my work. However, I've had a difficult time
  listening to design blogs, blogs that have information that I'd like to at least
  kind of absorb. I've finally given in and am finding a way to sort of do it.\r\n\r\nThese
  guys are funny and irreverent. Be A Design Cast: <a href=\"http://www.beadesigngroup.com/blog/archives/2006/03/be_a_design_cast_10_typography.html\">#10

    Goodness</a><cite>, this one is a photoblog, totally guilt-free!</cite>\r\n\r\nYou're
    right, they can be difficult to listen/read to, especially Design Observer, difficult
    to absorb/digest without deep, dedicated reading and thought so I don't really
    have time to read them often. Somehow I seem to have time to lurk around the Type
    ID board here... :^)"
