body: This is the cleanest version of their logo one of our customers could provide
  us with.  I&#39;ve been using it for about 6 months now and I can&#39;t stand it
  any more.  I&#39;m going to recreate free of charge just so I don&#39;t have to
  look this peice of garbage.  The font is similar to Futura or Century Gothic, but
  the mid-point of the M doesn&#39;t touch the baseline.  Anyone recognize it? <BR>
  <BR>Thanks in advance for sharing your knowledge. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/47917.jpg"
