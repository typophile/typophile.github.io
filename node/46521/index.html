  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>First I should mention that the goal here is not in fact randomness, because we want a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; effect, where adjacent glyphs are not identical&ndash;which is what would occur occasionally with a truly random disposition of glyphs.</p>
<p>In these examples, there are four alternates of each character in the font (including punctuation and, importantly, the space). They are sorted in four classes, @one, @two, @three and @four.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 was provided by Thomas Phinney. This is the first lookup.
It sets glyphs from a sequence of classes: 1234 1234 1234, which then repeats.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 is a tweak I provided, to deal with repetitive five-character sequences, as in &ldquo;they do the things&hellip;&rdquo;
This is implemented by the second lookup.
It sets the class sequence to: 1234 1324 3142, which then repeats.</p>
<p>Version 3.0 deals with the line-break problem. (Because layout applications don&rsquo;t carry contextuality from one line to the next, starting over every line, a word like &ldquo;the&rdquo; at the start of a line is set with the same glyphs every time.) This method was suggested by John Hudson. It works backwards from the fifth character in the line (chosen, again, to deal primarily with the problem of &ldquo;the&rdquo;). My code splits possible fifth letters into seven groups, arranged to separate those that occur most frequently in English into different groups. The seventh group is the default, and not coded. It includes all accented characters, as I have not bothered to make truly comprehensive classes, as I did with classes one through four, which might include them.
This adjusts Version 2.0 by changing the first four classes in the sequence, depending on the fifth character in the line, to one of: 3143, 4324, 2413, 3214, 4132, 2314 or 1432.</p>

In what style of font do you see random substitution as best used?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never tried to achieve a total random look, but the last 2 script fonts I&rsquo;ve worked on (both connecting) I&rsquo;ve gotten close to this effect just through using a lot of contextual substitution with certain classes. I would see Random substitution being most useful where the variations are subtle and letters are not connected. I&rsquo;ve been adding contextual variations of ligatures as well which seems to be a useful thing for handlettering style designs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Pseudo-random reduces repetition. For instance, consider f_f.
In a four-alternates font, there would be four different f_f ligatures, but 12 different combinations of individual f and f.
I&rsquo;ve developed this code while working on Duffy Script, which is not connected.
However, the variations don&rsquo;t have to be subtle.
But they do have to work with every other glyph except themselves, so it&rsquo;s a more more complex design procedure, &ldquo;mulling&rdquo; (as James Montalbano puts it) over the whole as one works on the individual.
I don&rsquo;t see why this shouldn&rsquo;t be applied to any genre of type, from strictly geometric sans to swashy connected script.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know of one type of font where such features make sense: lettering fonts for comic strips. They intentionally simulate hand lettering, and they often have alternates (usually put in easy reach as UC/LC in a caps-only font) for the purpose of avoiding identical letters. (But the letter I usually has an alternate where the presence of serifs indicates a capital letter - or, rather, a letter that would still have been a capital even if the text weren&rsquo;t in all caps.)</p>
<p>For such a face, it might be worthwhile to get more elaborate.</p>
<p>Each letter might have five forms. Which form is used depends on which letter, and which form of that letter, preceded it. But there are two (really four) possible successors for each preceding letter - one picked by shifting the letter. (And if the previous letter was shifted, another two.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry for the break. Nick, there are things that happen in writing, where the foreknowledge and memory of the writer go beyond the line breaks, which is OT&rsquo;s boundary.</p>
<p>So, in this example, &ldquo;It affords me&rdquo; is written with a pen that becomes unloaded, i.e. runs nearly dry by the time&quot;much&quot;is written. It reloads, in time for &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;  and etc.</p>
<p>Next, there is no way to know not to cross the t, because a long descending f was used in the previous line, as the &ldquo;fine&rdquo; above, does to &ldquo;that&rdquo; which is below.</p>
<p>This is neither random, pseudo-random, or an OTability I know of, and there is more. .</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Right, OT contextuality is conﬁned to single lines (and stumbles at either end). It also fails when tracking (beyond a small amount) is applied—which is really annoying, as that is an intentional feature of layout applications, not a bug or technical limitation.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I do think that your example here, with its huge “negative leading”, is an outlier/special case. If typographers decide to adopt this tricky practice, they are likely aware that it will create extender collisions which will not be ameliorated by the layout app’s H&amp;J’s or OT smart fonts, and are prepared to deal with them manually, or let things fall as they may.</p>
<p>One might just as well dismiss “smart quotes” software that replaces hash marks with proper quote marks, because it fails when dealing with apostrophes at the beginning of words.</p>
<p>Pseudo-randomization is intended to mimic certain “natural media” effects but it cannot produce a perfect facsimile of virtuoso calligraphy and layout on the ﬂy. I doubt the author of the example could either, without ﬁrst sketching the layout—note how the “g” in “king” anticipates the line below.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Now Nick, I&rsquo;m not dismissing pseudo random typography!?  You asked, I showed, you said you did not understand, I explained. You seem to understand now, good. I just don&rsquo;t think roulette can be applied to any genre of type, because not all genres of type can be properly composed with Any random bits whatsoever, though not all.</div>

<p>Perhaps the only problem here was to the label the thread &ldquo;pseudo randomness&rdquo;? Ditching the label, try the type and let&rsquo;s see the result.</p>
<p>If you want to stay purely theoretical, give some thought to the question of whether or not there could be more than one utopia. Most of us would settle for &ldquo;this is nice.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for posting the Flickinger specimen, David.
You’re right, such a controlled piece of calligraphy has no place for randomness.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that this penman’s methodology could be readily “pseudomized” with Contextual Alternates.</p>
<p>In particular, the heavying up of certain downstrokes, but never (with the exception of double-f) for adjacent glyphs, is just the sort of thing that the Contextual Alternates feature handles well.</p>
<p>Also, the use of different forms of “t” for initial, middle and terminal position.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your quite welcome Nick. It’s definitely an interesting specimen. After drawing a font in response over the last few seasons, I took a break to confer with Kent Lew about the OT possibilities of this same specimen, and we’re doing an excercise.  That plan led me to discuss it with Petr van Blokland, who’s always working at least a little on layout features.</p>
<p>There are always going to be limits on achieving handmade appearance, so I’m not trying to do the impossible. I take something like these Chinese compositions (<a href="http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/62A6116A12015.html)">http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/62A6116A12015.html)</a>, as an example of something so far inside of a person, I think it’s beyond computers to store.</p>
<p>But you can see brushes loading up with ink, and spreading it out into writing, (and sure there’s some random in there too!). But there is also care in distributing that ink as evenly as possible, if that’s the compositional need, or not, if that’s what’s needed.</p>
