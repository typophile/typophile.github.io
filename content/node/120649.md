    see it\r\n\r\nNo need to use an external hosting site. Just edit the file name
    so it doesn't include any spaces or special characters, and use the \u201CInsert
    image\u201D function at the bottom of the comment window."

  body: I'm sure someone will recognise it now, but if you ever find a font on a website,
    linking to that website is helpful for us searchers, because we can look in the
    source code/use special browser addons. Just a tip for future searches! :)
