  Bilak]], The Netherlands, and [[Satya Rajpurohit]], India, have launched the [[Indian
  Type Foundry]] (<a href=\"http://www.indiantypefoundry.com\"> http://www.indiantypefoundry.com
  </a>)to focus on Indic typefaces. Their inaugural font family extends Peter's classic
  sans typeface family [[Fedra]] to the [[Hindi]] alphabet.\r\n\r\nFrom this mornings'
  press release:\r\n\r\n<em>The Indian Type Foundry (ITF) is the first company to
  develop and directly distribute digital fonts in India. ITF was initiated by Peter
  Bi\u013Eak of Typotheque in partnership with SN Rajpurohit and Rajesh Kejriwal (Kyoorius
  Exchange). \u201CRajesh has been incredibly active in bringing the Indian design
  community together. He has created the first Indian design magazine and first Indian
  design conference, and been a catalyst behind many collaborative projects in India\u201D,
  says Peter Bi\u013Eak. \u201CThat\u2019s why I was very pleased that Rajesh agreed
  to join us to create ITF. And I have worked with the very talented Satya Rajpurohit
  for the past two years on Fedra Hindi, our first typeface specifically designed
  for the Indian market.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typ_itf_hindi_4049.png]"

    If it makes sense at all, of course (in Japanese, for example, it\u2019s relatively
    common mixing kanji and/or kana with latin script)."

  body: "Well, of course there are are fonts for the Devanagari script (in which the
    Hindi language\u2014among others\u2014is written). There are fonts for all of
    the common Indic scripts. There are also Indian type foundries running in India,
    too. I can think of at least two (C-DAC, which you might argue is more an institution
    than a foundry and Modular Infotech). I've had the privilege of being able to
    visit Modular Infotech and the company has something like 50 employees and a network
    of designers that they buy letter designs from. Of course, this company is not
    really known much outside of India. Maybe it is because they wrote all their own
    font design software, make their fonts with that, and primarily sell the fonts
    along with the necessary typesetting software to use them properly. This means
    that they run along a different track than most of us in the type and font business.\r\n\r\nMost
    of the Indic fonts in use are not OpenType fonts, however. This has many reasons
    behind it. One of them is the reality of the software market at present\u2026\r\n\r\nThe
    Indian Type Foundry's press release is definitely right about the lack of design
    software that supports the OpenType features necessary for Indic fonts. Adobe
    CS4 has a work-around to support them (finally!), and there are 3rd party plug-ins
    that one can buy. But this is not real support. Microsoft Word has real support
    for Indic script OT fonts, but that is not a design application.\r\n\r\nBy \"first,\"
    I expect that they mean that they are the first type foundry in the way that we
    envision font makers in the west. This is a company of good designers who make
    good fonts, and market these good fonts to graphic designers, who will use them
    in their work. A lot of the traditional customers of Indic fonts have been software
    developers, publishers, and newspapers. Graphic Design seems to be becoming really
    huge in India, and this makes Indian graphic designers it quite a market to be
    addressed. In Indian design using English and the Latin script, many customers
    want the best and the most popular fonts, just like designers all over the world
    do. It is difficult for these designers to find fonts of the same quality for
    their own languages and scripts. I suspect that ITF wants to make this difficulty
    less difficult ;-)"

  body: "Thanks Dan, that is right.\r\n\r\nOf course digital Devanagari (and other
    Indic) fonts existed before, they are both made in the West and in India. There
    are some fantastic designs made. In both cases, they have been primarily made
    to support software, and in India, fonts were often application specific. By producing
    Unicode compliant fonts ITF hopes to make it less dependent on software & hardware,
    so documents can be as interchangeable as we are used to in the West.\r\n\r\nThere
    are also wider, educational, intentions of ITF, and right now we are preparing
    outlines for the next steps. We would certainly like to create a community that
    can also create lively discussions about Indian typography. Dan, I will write
    you directly about this soon.\r\n"

    up to, especially in regards to Indian type development.\r\nPerhaps then the claim
    should have been the first Indian type foundry that produces Unicode-compliant
    digital fonts for a retail market. That might have been the right set of qualifiers
    to distinguish this venture, no?"
