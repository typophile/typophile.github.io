  Anyone?"

    and the last one in \"EXPLOSIVES\"). This is hand-drawn. Ultramodern is similar
    in style.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Cool. The lettering artists must have worked from sample books, though &ndash;
    I wonder if those can still be found.

    I wonder if those can still be found.</cite>\r\nDo a search on eBay for \"lettering\"
    under Books. Old Speedball manuals are usually available. About a year ago a guy
    was selling his grandfather's collection of sign writing and commercial art books.
    I think the grandfather had been a scene painter in Hollywood. I managed to get
    a couple of holy grail lettering books from the early 1900s."

    closest. The \"R\" is different, but as said before the picture shows hand lettering.
    It could very have been from \"Ludlow Typefaces\"...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=Ultra+Modern\r\n"
