    and designers. I know I have some of these, but they are in storage and I wont
    be able to look for them in the near future. Maybe some fellow-Typophile can shed
    light here?\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "Rub-down type was the low end of the display type market. It was mainly popular
    with students, freelancers and do-it-yourselfers (which included me). Letraset
    was at the high end of this low-end market. It was more expensive than other brands
    (around $10 per sheet/font), but it also was the highest quality and had the best
    selection of typefaces. They also sought out and published original typefaces
    by independent designers (see Robert above). Most, if not all, of Letraset's original
    type designs were published in mainstream font formats (phototype, digital type)
    later on, though not always with authorization.\r\n\r\nLetraset's marketing rivaled
    any other type manufacturer of the time. They published an annual catalog with
    quarterly supplements as well as a (I think) quarterly publication about type
    called <a href=\"http://www.baselinemagazine.com/about_contact/history_and_awards/\">Baseline</a>(which
    still exists, but is not published by Letraset anymore). Their promotional materials
    were often designed by prominent designers. They were sort of the Veer of the
    1970s. :-)"
