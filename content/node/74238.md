  into creating my first letters. I'm very new at this so once again I'm asking for
  advice. I've posted information on this project a while ago and have since been
  heading in a different direction. Here is the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/73336\">original
  post.</a>\r\n\r\nIf there are any ways to improve the wordmark, please share your
  thoughts.\r\n\r\nI also need to choose a primary font to go with this, and so far
  I've been looking at large x-heights like Axel, Info, Unit, Meta. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wordmark_3753.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wordmark_colors_4084.jpg]"
