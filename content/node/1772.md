  Years of Printing</i> &#40;1955&#41; ? <BR> <BR>It&#39;s full of loveliness like
  this : <BR> <BR><b>It is rather one of the most wholesome consequences of the worldwide
  expansion of the printing press that the one Latin alphabet should have become the
  one medium in which every human thought can find adequate expression.</b> <BR> <BR>But
  he also makes some extremely astute comments about Gaelic typography and I was wondering
  who exactly he was and if he was taken seriously nowadays. <BR> <BR>Any info would
  be appreciated. <BR> <BR>Matha.'

  body: Matha, I can tell you that it was on my required reading list at Reading.
    I&#39;ve not &#34;dipped&#34; into in quite a while, but I have it at home. Are
    you curious about the table of contents?

  body: <i>Are you curious about the table of contents?</i> <BR>  <BR>I have it in
    front of me, Tiffany, thanks. I&#39;m curious about Steinberg himself.The blurb
    about him doesn&#39;t say much &#40;Leipzig University, Courtauld Institute, inteligence
    work during the war, editor of lots of encyclopedias and dictionaries, fellow
    of the Royal Historical Society.&#41; <BR> <BR>Beatrice Warde did his introduction
    and it seems to be pretty well-researched. Does he have a good reputation? <BR>

    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Yes. Well, the second I posted, I realized that.  <BR> <BR>I
    think it might be easy to say that a book that is only 272 pages in length can&#39;t
    possibly be worth reading. However, this book has a couple things going for it.
    The British Library is one of the publisher&#39;s and Beatrice Warde wrote the
    intro. Apparently Steinberg is to be thought of in good light. <BR> <BR>I googled
    &#40;as you probably did already&#41; and came across this teensy bit of information:
    <BR> <BR><a href=\"http://www.dotprint.com/fgen/history.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dotprint.com/fgen/history.htm</a>
    <BR> <BR><i>FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF PRINTING BY S H STEINBERG, revised by  John
    Trevitt &#40;The British Library and Oak Knoll Press</i>  <BR>  <BR><i>Hitler
    unwittingly did this country a favour when he forced so many  German and Central
    European scholars into exile in the 1930s. Whether Jewish or Gentile, they brought
    with them a very Germanic dedication to scholarship  which is in some ways superior
    to the home-grown variety and, like most refugees, they worked amazingly hard
    to re-establish themselves in a new environment.  <BR>  <BR> Famous examples include
    the architectural scholar Nikolaus Pevsner, the art historian E H Gombrich, typographers
    and book designers Hans  Schmoller and Jan Tschichold, and Sigfrid Henry Steinberg,
    the unrivalled historian  of printing. First published in 1955 as a Pelican Book,
    with the  encouragement of Schmoller, Five Hundred Years of Printing proved to
    be a  bestseller, with 70,000 copies of the Pelican editions sold over a period
    of 24 years  and parallel hardback editions issued by Faber &amp; Faber.  <BR>
    \ <BR> The present publication is the fourth revision of a work whose author  died
    in 1979, too early to take much account of offset-litho printing and well  before
    the general use of digital typesetting and the introduction of the  Internet,
    which both feature in John Trevitt&#39;s revision of Steinberg&#39;s  third and
    final chapter.  <BR>  <BR> This has now been divided into three, so that instead
    of The  Nineteenth Century and After we have The Nineteenth Century, 1900-1955
    and  The Postwar World. In his Preface, Trevitt comments: &#39;On re-reading Five
    Hundred Years , I was struck by its lightly-worn learning, both deep and wide
    &amp;shyp; and by a feeling that on any and every subject the author  knew far
    more than he had space to tell us.&#39;  <BR>  <BR> Lightly-worn learning was
    acquired by persistent effort. Steinberg&#39;s Ph.D  thesis at Leipzig University
    had the heavily Germanic title of  Documentation methods of the Goslar City Council
    up to the mid-14th Century. He was  then 23 years old and 12 years later he fled
    from Nazi rule to England. Teaching German in evening classes, which led to the
    publication of A  One-Year German Course &#40;Macmillan&#41;, then writing and
    editing history books and  encyclopedias, established Steinberg in the English
    publishing world.  <BR>  <BR> Readers who remember Ipex 1963 and its fascinating
    sideshow, Printing &amp; the Mind of Man,, will not be surprised to learn that
    Steinberg  played a major part in its organisation under the direction of Stanley
    Morison. So close was his friendship with the great typographer that they agreed
    to write each other&#39;s obituaries for The Times &amp;shyp; surely the greatest
    example of back-scratching in any coterie. <BR>  <BR>  To conclude the personal
    observations drawn from the Preface,  Steinberg&#39;s wife is quoted as saying:
    &#39;S H never realised that other people were not able or willing to work a 16-hour
    day, as he often did himself.&#39; And on the same page, there is his portrait
    photo, looking for all the world  like Henry Kissinger&#39;s older brother. What
    of the book itself? Well and  clearly written, it also has the best qualities
    of a reference book. <BR>  <BR> If you want to know about the development of printing
    techniques,  typefaces and book production in any European or other English-speaking
    country,  Steinberg is your man. Should you wish to shine on Mastermind, you could
    choose  printing history as your subject on the basis of this book.  <BR>  <BR>
    Here are some sample questions:  <BR> Q: What is the world&#39;s oldest established
    printing company? <BR> A: Orell F\xFCssli of Z\xFCrich, established as Froschauer
    in 1521.  <BR> Q: Who invented the title page?  <BR> A: Gutenberg&#39;s successor,
    Peter Sch\xF6ffer, for a papal bull of  1463. <BR> Q: Who introduced printing
    to Russia?  <BR> A: The German, Hans Missenheim, at the invitation of Ivan the
    Terrible in  1552.  <BR> Q: Who introduced accents in French printing?  <BR> A:
    Robert Estienne in the 1530s.  <BR> Q: Why is the Judas Bible of 1611 so-called?
    \ <BR> A: Because in Matt. xxvi 36 it names Judas as presiding at the Last  Supper.
    \ <BR> Q: And the Wicked Bible?  <BR> A: Because it gives the seventh commandment
    as Thou shalt commit  adultery. And so on. <BR>  <BR> A fresh selection of illustrations
    has been made for the new edition, but  it is a pity that they are not indexed.
    The reviser mentions the fact  that his publisher insisted on a maximum of 272
    pages and the resulting longer  lines and smaller typeface make the book less
    readable than the Faber  edition of 1959. Nevertheless, even if regarded simply
    as a reference book, Five Hundred Years deserves a place on the printer&#39;s
    bookshelf beside the  English dictionary. <BR>  <BR> And as tens of thousands
    of readers can testify, it is really much more than a reference book. As Trevitt
    comments, it established the invention of printing at the centre of modern history,
    thereby appealing not only to printers, but also to a wide circle of general readers
    interested in history.</i>  <BR> "

    got his PhD at the age of 23 and wrote Stanley Morison&#39;s obituary.  <BR>Can&#39;t
    go wrong there. I was planning on shining some good light on him anyway. I have
    to get an abstract off this week for a conference on Irish book history and I
    just wanted to check he wasn&#39;t a nutcase or anything.  <BR> <BR>The PhD thing
    reminds me of a bit of blurb I read on the back of a David Hume book.  <BR>&#34;He
    entered Edinburgh University at the age of 12, but left before completing his
    degree&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Those were the days. <BR> <BR>Goodnight and thanks a million.

  body: Steinberg&#39;s book was one of the first systematic surveys of European printing
    history conceived as a whole rather than focusing on an individual country, and
    has remained a well respected text. It belongs to the same typographic movement
    that resulted in the famous &#60;I&#62;Printing and the Mind of Man&#60;/I&#62;
    exhibition. I don&#39;t know anything about the man, other than that my father
    might have known him &#40;he studied at the Courtauld Institute&#41;.

    place was that he places Ireland very firmly in its European context. On top of
    that he refers to Gaelic typography as &#39;artificial&#39;, something that Irish
    writers could never and British writers would never dare do. <BR> <BR>A breath
    of fresh air, to say the least. <BR> <BR>Matha
