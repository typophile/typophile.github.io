body: "Hi there, I was wondering if anyone would be so kind as to help me identify
  some fonts popular in the 70s. I have a rough idea of what kind of typefaces they
  are and what contemporary iterations I may be able to use in place of them, but
  I would just very much like to know their names and their back-stories. \r\n \r\n\r\n1)
  A hairline serif/bodoni font. Pistilli Roman? Carousel? By the size and the printing
  quality I'm not 100 percent sure about the porportion of the hairline to the thick
  stroke. Also, in other examples a few of the uppercase letters, such as the \"K\",
  have stately ball terminals. \r\n\r\n2) A condensed sans. I wonder if it's a condensed
  version of a giant family? \r\n\r\n3) A condensed slab serif like New York magazine's.
  \r\n\r\n4) A geometric rationalized sans that I first thought was ITC Avant Garde,
  but the uppercase \"K\" has a little cornered edge that seems uncharacteristic of
  the face.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance!\r\n"

    sans = Avant Garde, the alternate lowercase is interesting."

    you were right about the printing mistake. I have a liking towards those edges!
    Like norm's Replica. I thought I'd found a gem from the past.\r\n\r\n"
