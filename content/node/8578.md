body: Ok ladies and gents, here&#39;s my problem. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to get started
  in designing typefaces.  A lot of the designers and artists I talk to can direct
  me to the use of type in design, but never about the true to form, design of a typeface.
  <BR> <BR>With that in mind, where is a good place to start? &#40;Besides reading
  everything that is posted here, which I try my hardest to do.&#41; <BR> <BR>Any
  good books that you recommend that you&#39;ve read?  There&#39;s a glut of information
  out there, and I tend to not trust any old amazon.com review or back cover description
  online. <BR> <BR>I would appreciate the help.

    rec on what to start with.  While I don&#39;t doubt those are great books, there
    has to be a few that are best to start off with... <BR> <BR>thank you for the

  body: you bring up a good point... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a student right now.  I love
    typography &#40;obviously or I wouldn&#39;t be here.&#41; Designing a type face
    appears to be a daunting task at this point, but is something I&#39;d love to
    accomplish.  Having a background in newspapers and communications has me in love
    with the functionality of any typeface. <BR> <BR>I just don&#39;t know where to
    start.  I didn&#39;t know if there were books or other tools that gave a walk
    through on type design or if there are certain standards a typeface should possess.
    <BR> <BR>Hopefully that is a clearer explaination than my original post...

  body: I would add to what has already been listed Robert Bringhurst&#39;s <i>Elements
    of Typographic Style</i> &#40;which is not specifically about type design, but
    is still very helpful&#41; and <i>Type By Design</i> for when you are ready to
    start working in Fontographer or FontLab. <BR> <BR>The books Mr. Hudson lists
    are excellent and highly recommended.

  body: 'I would suggest an exercise: something less daunting than designing a whole
    new typeface from scratch, but which will teach you a number of useful things.
    Find an existing typeface and make an adaptation of it for a specific purpose,
    e.g. a newspaper version of a traditional book face, or a headline version of
    a text face, or a lighter or heavier version of a face. This is only an excercise,
    of course, and you won&#39;t end up with anything sellable &#40;unless you want
    to offer it to the owner of the original font&#41;, but I think you can learn
    a lot in this way. Also, if you are ever interested in getting a job in type design,
    you are likely to find this sort of work to be among the things you are asked
    to do.'

    too Fontographer-centric to be an optimal help with up to date tools, I recommend
    Leslie Cabarga&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1581804369"><i>Logo

  body: I would recommend two places to start, both of which reduce the sheer number
    of design parameters to be dealt with. <BR> <BR>1. A casual face &#40;eg Fontesque,
    which was my first digital font&#41;. You don&#39;t have to worry about conforming
    to what the &#34;proper &#34; character forms are and how they fit together --
    sophisticated cultural/technical nuances which are a big hurdle to start with.
    At the same time, you do have to find a way to get your casual shapes to combine
    -- but you have some leeway. Drawing and scanning is a good place to start , because
    one expresses oneself authentically in the drawn form. <BR> <BR>2. A monoline
    &#34;techno&#34; face &#40;eg Matt Desmond&#39;s new Variable&#41;. Basically
    a stroked path. This means that considerations of weighting &#40;contrast, stress,
    and joint thinning&#41; are not an issue. And being condensed, fit and proportional
    width are simplified. Techno construction is also a good place to start, because
    the way one focuses on the basic capabilities of the vector tools is also authentic,
    &#34;true to materials&#34;, when the tool is Illustrator/Fontographer/FontLab.
