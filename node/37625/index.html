  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>Any maths genious here? Raph are you at home? ;-)</p>
<p>Seriously I was wondering about Beziér this morning.
What mathematical formular in terms of f(x) = x hides behind it?
Most interesting for the derivation functions, the ones of the second and third degree that may determine the forms character.
Is it possible (in case - maybe I am totally wrong. Forgot all about maths ;-) to change it?
Could it be possible to get an alternative curve more soft and round?
I’d love to have it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The key thing about cubic Bezier curves is that you can do S shapes between two points, which quadratic curves cannot. This makes it easier for drawing, as you can use fewer points, and use the handles to get the shape you want.</p>
<p>Cubic Beziers are limited in the curves you can get, but you can closely approximate other curves between two points by adding intermediate points. The same idea is done with quadratic curves, where cubic curves are translated to quadratic automatically for True Type outlines by adding intermediate points. So you have more segments drawn with quadratic formulas that end up closely approximating the original cubic curve.</p>
<p>Here on Typophile, Raph Levien has published his [[http://www.typophile.com/node/33531|new drawing tool called Spiro.]] It is based on a special spiral, and does straight to round curves with a smoother and more natural curve. After drawing with the spiral tool, the application then can automatically convert the curves to cubic Beziers, adding intermediate points. There are links on the thread to the tool, as it now exists.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey William,</p>
<p>thanks! I know about Raphs developements and believe me or not, without knowing about it before, I recognized something special in his font redesigns as Centaur or Zeno. They have a very – how to say? - lovely quality. I tried to install his software but it didn’t work on my system (10.3.9) I think he has excellent ideas but its sometimes hard to get information from him. Apparently he isn’t so much into typophile at the moment. Or maybe disappointed by some reactions on his ideas.
I am convinced that somehting in Beziér is quite crank. All above near to the tangent points curves are too steep. Making intermediate points weakens the design specially when resolution is not big enough. You can get better results using intermediates making very very large designs, yet they don’t fit in later or have to be recalculated with the same disturbing results. Did you personally never had the idea that the digital curves cannot catch up with organic forms? I can spend days trying to tune a curve for example in the belly of a minor ‘a’ or similar.
I know your point of view that it depends more in the effect of type in masses but isn’t it that a defect that is of a so general nature infects the whole atmosphere of a typeface also? 
Did you ever had the strange (not clearly to define) impression that digital type even the most brillant ones look kind of ”stretched”. I am reading at the moment a book for example in a new digital Baskerville. Not the slick ones made after the DTP came up, no, the good ones nowadays in use. It is so perfect that my eye seems to be torn through the lines without concentrating on the content. If I read an old italian paperback, made with a strange old Linotype Garamond with its letters bouncing up and down, the enjoy of reading is so much deeper and easier for the eye. And I think its not because of the differences of typefaces - I mean families and so on - but because of the main difference between digital and analog form.
And apart from irregularities that play an important part (a good one) in that I think it depends also on the Beziér characteristic. Excuse my bad English!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>PS
Maybe its not so much a problem of the curves (if one could use intermediates without destroying the design) but of the restraint of digital raster. You know the difference between making a decision on the point as we do by hand and not only making decisions between one unit up or down or left or right as we do by handling tangents or other systems.</p>
