  Wang typeface. The name is as follows:\r\n\r\nRobert A. Elling III\r\n\r\nNow, since
  these are for wedding invites I want to know what's the most proper way and/or best
  way to do this. Specifically, the tile of 'the third'. So, I'm not fond of the idea
  of three I swash capitals but here are the other options:\r\n\r\niii\r\nthe third\r\nIii\r\n\r\nI'm
  not sure how to approach this; so, if anyone has any ideas, your help is much appreciated!!!\r\n\r\nc"

  body: Maybe three lowercase dotless i's, to sort of suggest small caps, although
    that might look like one w. Could you use a less elaborate I from a similar typeface?
    Some script faces have small caps that you might be able to use, although I don't
    know of any off the top of my head with the same copperplate cursive look. Is
    3rd out of the question?
