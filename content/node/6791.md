  somewhat. <BR> <BR>It looks like maybe Helvetica of some variety, judging from the
  leg of the &#39;R&#39;.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49492.jpg"

    target="_blank"> Helvetica Inserat</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/compressed/testdrive.html?s=WARP&amp;p=72"

  body: The problem with Helvetica is that the &#39;W&#39; looks nothing like the
    one in the logo, no matter how much I skew it. <BR> <BR>This image shows the difference
    in that the valleys in the W descend below the red line, where they don&#39;t
    in the logo. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49495.jpg"

  body: Isn&#39;t Swiss just another version of Helvetica? Martin, the sample is &#40;I
    assume&#41; a printed piece, and depending on what they printed it on you can
    have alot of the counters fill in. Plus the sample might be old enough to be a
    photostat then printed. Once again a loss of type quality.

  body: You&#39;re right, Swiss is derived from Helvetica, but Helvetica doesn&#39;t
    have the Black face which filled in the counters more. Italic filled them in even
    more.
