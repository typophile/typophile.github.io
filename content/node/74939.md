  body: "I think it might be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-serif-gothic/|Serif
    Gothic Heavy]] with a customised 8 for the g. I'm not sure where that v is from.
    As I'm looking at a Letraset catalogue right now, maybe it was done from leftovers
    on a transfer sheet so there was some hand-drawing involved. Ink spread from the
    printing process has probably contributed to extra wonkiness.\r\n\r\nIt's closer
    to Serif Gothic Heavy in the Letraset catalogue but more like Serif Gothic Bold
    on the digital version on MyFonts.\r\n\r\n"
