    separated by a comma, you can use the "Generate Glyph" function and they will
    be placed properly. '

  body: "After following a link in that thread, I learned something new.\r\n\r\nIn
    OpenType, \"clig\" tags a contextual ligature; \"dlig\" tags a discretionary ligature;
    and \"liga\" tags a standard ligature. That does provide... a reasonable amount
    of flexibility.\r\n\r\nAh, but not mentioned in the discussion is \"hlig\" for
    historical ligatures - handy, as is noted, for long s forms.\r\n\r\nThere's also
    \"init\", \"medi\", \"fina\" and \"isol\"... and \"jalt\" for justification alternates.\r\n\r\nI
    suppose all this complexity is needed if one is going to properly implement Unicode.
    So one even has \"haln\" for the halant forms in Sanskrit... oh, dear."

  body: "John, thanks for pointing the hlig feature. I was unaware of it.\r\n\r\n<cite>There's
    also \"init\", \"medi\", \"fina\" and \"isol\"... and \"jalt\" for justification
    alternates.</cite>\r\n\r\nYes, but these features are just for scripts like Arabic,
    where glyphs change according to its postion in a word. Actually, most features
    are optional and one can properly implement Unicode using just some of them.\r\n\r\nBack
    to Davide question, if you are planning a font with wide language support, it's
    important to consider the inclusion of combining diacritics. This implies a good
    amount of additional work, but it's highly recommended.\r\n"
