  if anyone could identify the font used as they only have low resolution jpegs of
  the logo.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nSimon"

    application such as Illustrator or Corel Draw. You could even use an autotrace
    facility to get started, then clean up the result.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    font for other things as well, if it existed.  Would you know of any similar faces?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again.\r\n\r\nSimon"

  body: "What you have are two shapes (which happen to look like letters of the alphabet)
    that were drawn to fit together and into a particular oval.\r\n\r\nEven those
    two letters were not designed consistently, as they would be in a typeface - the
    two downstrokes of the A are significantly different, while those on the H are
    the same. The H has serifs, where the A does not.\r\n\r\n\"Similar\" is in the
    mind of the beholder - the aspects that might make something look similar to me
    are probably not the same ones that appeal to someone else. Those initials have
    some characteristics of Swash faces,some characteristics of scripts, and some
    characteristics of  display fonts that simulate calligraphy or brush strokes.\r\n\r\n
