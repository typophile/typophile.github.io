  is somewhat hard to explain exactly what this is, but it will convert any text that
  you enter into musical notation. You can play and print out your text...now your
  parking ticket can serenade you...or that Nigerian bank email can lull you to sleep.
  Give it a try, have fun! http://p22.com/musicfont/"

    Penman_, played on string instruments at an appropriately baroque tempo.\r\n\r\nWanting
    to get the effect of a longer text, I tried a BBC news story about Fidel Castro,
    parts of which were surprisingly melodic."

  body: I was playing around with this last night, showing a friend, and stumbled
    onto the fact that if you put in a large amount of text (so it plays awhile),
    you can choose a whole virtual orchestra of instruments (not just one) to play
    along.  With only one, it sounds interesting, but combine a celesta with the seashore,
    some guitar fretting, and a muted trumpet....  :-)
