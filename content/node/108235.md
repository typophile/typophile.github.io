  client. Their corporate ID uses Myriad and Clarendon - neither of which I have issue
  with, but for a magazine format which is about 'demonstrating what they're about'
  rather than 'selling what they're about'. I want something that hints at their corporate
  ID but is a bit more lifestyle and characterful.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks,
  as always."

    before.

  body: "Hi sorry for the late reply. I've re-posted but in case here is what I'm
    doing:\r\n\r\nI'm designing a print publication for a large Indian conglomerate
    which is involved in heavy manufacturing, service industries and FMCG's. The title
    is to introduce their brand(s) to the European market, and will be akin to Monocle
    in it's ideology and breadth.\r\n\r\nI had in mind a font superfamily to bring
    harmony to the various strands of content and wanted something classic but fresh
    and contemporary and also future-proof.\r\n\r\nI have been looking at Freight,
    but the cost is prohibitive especially as I can't test the font in the design
    and present to the client.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a similar hard-working family
    or any other thoughts/recommendations?"
