body: "Hey, I'm looking for a couple of sans serif faces that are or have very black
  weights. I'm thinking as black as Underware's recent (custom) Fat Ed, Fedra Sans
  Display 2, Amplitude Ultra weights, etc. They shouldn't be too funky.\r\n\r\nI'm
  leaning towards Fedra Sans Display 2, but I would like to look at other typefaces
  before I decide anything. Thanks in advance. :)"

    but a bit too cheerful. Or... 'optimistic', so to speak. It's for a poetrybook
    cover, and most poems have a slight dark undertone. I would like to give it a
    bold type treatment."

  body: Yes, actually, I just added Sansa Condensed and Soft Condensed to my list.
    The Ultra Black weights are beautiful. It's one of my favorites so far (Sansa
    is one of my favorite typefaces anyway).

  body: It is indeed a nice typeface, however I find the 'g' looking a bit clumsy.
    It doesn't seem to 'belong', it might be too light, I don't know. And the 'g'
    is in the title of the book. But thanks nonetheless! :)
