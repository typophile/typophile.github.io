  Library of Congress documents, as well as borders.  The fonts have been coming together
  great, but the borders are giving me a nightmare problem.\r\n\r\nSince I'm an historian
  first and graphic designer second, I haven't spent all that much time in FontLab
  prior to starting this, so any help would be immensely appreciated.\r\n\r\nHere
  is my problem:\r\n\r\nI've attached an image of whats' going on.  With my current
  spacing, when typed out in a string on the same line the glyphs (taken from an 1858
  broadside) fit snug against each other.  When typed out in Photoshop or Word with
  a hard return, the type conforms to the leading... so at various point sizes I have
  \ gaps between the top and bottom glyph.  \r\n\r\nI don't want that.  I want them
  snug right against each other on the hard return. I'm about to rip my hair out.
  \ What simple thing to I need to do in FontLab to make things work?\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\nJason Wickersty"

    with spaces in the file name, it seems).\r\n\r\nPerhaps both Word and Photoshop
    don't bother with something as trivial as \"the font's preferred leading\". Try
    setting the leading to \"100%\" -- I don't know where to look for in these programs,
    but InDesign's default for Auto Leading is \"120%\" and can be changed in the
    Justification settings dialog. Or simply set the leading equal to the font size."

  body: "Whoops!  I thought it attached!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/borderproblem_5080.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is with FontLab, trying to get it to make the two glyph just stay next
    to each other... Arg!  It's so simple to set the side bearings... why not top
    and bottom?! :P\r\n\r\nThere's another font package by WaldenFont which is sort
    of my inspiration.  They have other border fonts, and when you hard return, the
    two glyphs snuggle up to each other regardless of how the leading is set.  I want
    that!"

  body: "Since leading is something that is set in applications like Photoshop by
    the user, you have only limited control over this in the font. The best thing
    to do is to scale your border elements so that they are correctly spaced when
    the font is \u2018solid set\u2019, i.e. when there is no leading between the lines,
    e.g. 20pt text size on 20pt leading. This is the only predictable basis on which
    to work. What this means, in FontLab, is that your border elements should be equal
    to the UPM height of the font.\r\n\r\nFor applications that make use of font metrics
    to define default linespacing, you will want to set the OS/2 Typo and Win metrics
    values to also sum to the UPM value (treating negative descender values as positive
    for this calculation).\r\n\r\nYou can either sit the border elements on the baseline
    and have all the height above the baseline, or you can give them some descender
    space. This decision depends on whether and how you want them to align to other
    fonts.\r\n\r\nAs an example, presuming your fonts are on a 1000 UPM height. You
    might scale the border elements to close to that height, and sit them 300 units
    below the baseline. Then you would set the OS/2 metrics as follows:\r\n\r\nTypoAscender
    = 700\r\nTypoDescender = -300\r\nTypoLinegap = 0\r\nWinAscent = 700\r\nWinDescent
    = -300\r\n\r\nThe hhea metrics should match the corresponding OS/2 Typo values.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, then you have to communicate to the user that these fonts should be set
    solid in programs like Photoshop.\r\n\r\nThis is the approach we took with <a

  body: "Hi, just licensed the Wild West package. At first sight it doesn\u2019t seem
    like it works the way you tell: it depends on what the leading is (solid set gives
    the best results). I tested it in Word 2007 (PC), PhotoshopCS4, and InDesign CS4
    (Mac).\r\n\r\nI did a borders font a couple of months ago and the best way to
    go was the same as described by John.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
