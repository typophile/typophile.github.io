  body: "To make a circle, you should have just 4 points. One each at 12, 3, 6 and
    9 o'clock. \r\n\r\nThe same would apply to the spiral. You also want the bezier
    handles to adhere to a 180 or 90 degree angle (or, at the very least, keep them
    all at 2 consistent angles).\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'd follow Aluminum's advice & redraw the whole thing, using either half circles
    or quarter circles, that will give you the best looking result. All it takes is
    a little math & a few minutes time.

  body: "The spiral tool might be an easier way to draw a simple spiral, but how do
    you calculate what decay is required to draw your spiral, and how can you calculate
    the radii required (without redrawing parts of it in the first place) and then
    calculating what is required for the second spiral; it is simpler and quicker
    to redraw it from scratch using your original file as a guide.\r\n\r\nTim"
