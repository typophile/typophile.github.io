  I'm currently a design student in my senior year of school. I was hoping to get
  some criticism regarding my mark for my Corporate ID class.\r\n\r\nMy company is
  the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. Adler is one of the oldest planetariums in the
  world and by default has one of the richest histories of delivering a universal
  experience to all its customers.\r\n\r\nMy big idea is Awe. I want to show that
  the universe is infinite by displaying the depth of space. It seems that when people
  become older the loose faith in what they thought was amazing when they were kids.
  I wanted to emphasize the imagination of space as well as reconnect with the nostalgia
  of visitors who have given up on their youthful dreams.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.
  Any criticism will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nMike"

    I'll be making an entire system based off of the mark.

  body: I should point out that I wasn't suggesting something as simplistic as equating
    adler with eagle, or that the circular stars should be replaced with the pointy
    kind. The Eagle nebula was a convenient, punny way of pointing to some spectacular
    "depth of space" pictures. That's what I don't get from the logo -- the feeling
    of depth.

  body: Agreed, if you're going after depth you've missed it here. Seems like most
    of the stars would be lost at smaller sizes, and the composition seems like it
    would be a pain to work with inside any other element.

  body: "I agree with picard (what an appropriate name)... Those stars and parts of
    those serif letterforms will disappear at smaller sizes. It's an obvious approach
    which isn't bad, but at the moment it is too literal. I feel like you can achieve
    the same effect while using less yet bigger dots/stars, perhaps making a shape
    with them collectively that has some deeper meaning still.\r\n\r\nI'm a secret
    geek for space. I think your brief is in the right place; to pursue a type of
    depth and awesomeness in this mark will be ideal. Personally, the serif typeface,
    while nice, isn't invoking imagination with me, but more or less prestige."

  body: "Ya, for a logo that's definitely complex, however, I understand what you're
    trying to convey.\r\n\r\nIf I was going for \"AWE\" I would simply just slap the
    typeface on a crazy awesome photo from space instead of trying to incorporate
    it in the logo.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would like to see a more friendly typeface
    especially since museums want people to come see their goodies. But, I do like
    what you used.\r\n\r\nKeep at it, I'd like to see your progress."

  body: "I definitely think the stars are way too tiny. In practical applications
    (such as printing on business cards, etc) they will get lost when reduced to smaller
    sizes. You might consider making the larger dots even larger, and arranging them
    into something recognizeable such as the big dipper. \r\n\r\nRight now someone
    might misinterpret the dots as paint splatters, or worse, when printed, just as
    accidental ink spots or debris.\r\n\r\nI do like the general idea, but I think
    it needs to be defined and look like you placed the stars there in a purposeful
    way.\r\n\r\nAlso, consider an all-caps sans serif for the subtext.\r\n\r\nJust
    a thought: Maybe try a large cresecent shape across the top, to be reminiscent
    of planetarium tops. If you do that, I wouldn't get too cutesy with the arrangement
    of the stars b/c it would be too much.\r\n\r\nI like the color palette. This would
    also look nice as a part of a whole identity where navy becomes the primary background
    color for certain pieces (such as the back of a business card showing the logo
    by itself).\r\n\r\nGood work so far!\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

  body: 'I don''t see the need to use two colors. Is there a reason? If not, go with
    the blue. In fact, you may want to go white on a blue background. You might have
    to finagle the blue to make sure it can be printed on.. ) As this is student work,
    you have total control of the Identity and you can set the rules. So, I wouldn''t
    worry about dots being too small or whatever : they can be always be set to be  proportional
    to the substrate. What I would try is make ''Adler'' and ''Planetarium'' the same
    size and keep them on the same level. Your "logo" could then be the two words
    spaced out to fit the bottom, top, or side of any piece of collateral ( letterhead,
    business card, website background etc ) and then your stars fading out from the
    lettering. Your arrangement of stars is very pleasing to the eye otherwise.'

  body: "I realized I never defended my work, or at least explained the it further.\r\n\r\nI
    wanted colors that invoke depth, but also tie into the history of the company.
    The very dark blue is an obvious representation of space, the gold/mustard color
    representing prestige. However, I do like the one color suggestion that CGI stated.
    I also like the vertical type treatment. I can assure you I tried many type treatments,
    some being on the same baseline, not vertical, so it's an interesting solution.
    The teal is what throws me off. Its a good tertiary color that applies to museums
    and conveys sophistication, but not space (i guess thats arguable). But thank
    you for the criticism/help. Its greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe reason I like
    the \"mark\" with the logotype is that its very anti-mark... if that makes sense.
    It's not sterile. In other words, its not a circle with some design in it next
    to myriad pro, call it day. Maybe thats not fair, but this isnt a generic museum.
    This is the oldest planetarium in America. It has some of the oldest artifacts
    on the planet. And everyday it inspires children and adults alike.\r\n\r\nSo,
    it makes sense to be unique. The letterforms are kerned out and subtly represent
    space.  The \"stars\" are a texture that subtly represents depth and can be applied
    to a system (currently working on).\r\n\r\nI agree at a small scale, the \"dots\"
    will lose their affect. but don't most logo's? (im sure this can be argues to
    no end)\r\nBut for my idea, and what I'm trying to achieve, which is creating
    awe, a timeless, infinite, imaginative feeling, it applies. \r\n\r\nMy thinking
    is that its a non-traditional vs traditional logo that im trying to incorporate.
    Its a little unorthodox what im trying to accomplish. \r\n\r\nOne thing im working
    on in the system, is the mark and the logotype will not appear together in the
    signature if the two are going to be placed at a small scale. Obviously, its hard
    for me to showcase my BIG idea at 1/2 inch. But they will appear on the same piece.
    For example, a business card. One side will be bureaucratic while the other side
    has the spacial texture.\r\n\r\nOne thing I never try to trip up on is whether
    something is obvious or not, then questioning if its a bad thing. The strongest
    marks tell the simplest stories. "
