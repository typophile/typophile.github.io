  be suitable for use in legal work? I should start of by saying that I am based in
  the UK so, thankfully, I don\u2019t suffer from the \u201Cyou must use Courier\u201D
  rules that seem to plague the American system. However, there are some fairly horrific
  formatting conventions which can make producing attractive documents difficult.
  For an example, have a look at [[http://www.bna.com/bnabooks/ababna/annual/2000/cox.pdf|this]].\r\n\r\nThe
  main challenge is finding a typeface that has enough presence to look good: i) at
  reasonably large sizes; ii) where there is quite a lot of whitespace in inappropriate
  places; and iii) when there is quite large amounts of leading. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
  been wondering about one of the modern old-style faces (if that\u2019s the right
  description) that have appeared in the last few years. Something like Skolar or
  Leksa. I also quite like Calluna, and its price makes is particularly appealing.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any thoughts on these options, or any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks!"

  body: Yes, they are, and it is a very interesting site in general. I had discounted
    most of his suggestions either because I thought that they tend not to have enough
    weight to deal with all the whitespace that is encountered in this sort of work
    (e.g. Bembo) or because I think they work better in book sizes (e.g. Adobe Caslon).
    I was therefore thinking about some which had a bit more presence on the page
    might be better. However, I might be overestimating the problem.

  body: "FWIW, there are some recommendations in this older thread:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/40792\r\nIt
    appears that you shouldn't forget to check out the pilcrow and section mark in
    whatever font you're considering (as well as whatever other semi-obscure characters/features
    matter in your work)."

  body: "Nina, many thanks. Dolly might be another possibility, especially as it seems
    to look better in slightly larger sizes, but I think Fedra is probably a bit too
    funky (particularly the disconnected b).\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the main reason
    I was re-asking a similar question is that it seems that English rules and conventions
    are much less prescriptive than the the posters in that thread said that the American
    ones are. For instance, paragraphs are usually represented by p rather than \xB6
    and sections by s rather than \xA7. There also isn't a particular issue with using
    old-style figures. English legal submissions also seem to be a bit less like the
    blocks of text you get in America which is why I thought a different typeface
    might be in order.\r\n\r\nsim, yes, I did think about that. Gill Sans is becoming
    quite popular and, to my eyes, works quite well in these situations. However,
    I think to use both a non-traditional typeface and a sans serif would be just
    a bit too unconventional which is why I'd prefer a serif."
