  body: "I would assume that fonts coming in different sizes are in general good for
    small printing. With Adobe they are called \u201Coptical sizes\u201D and Arno
    Pro is an example here; there is a book-font (no bold-italics) <a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com\">Cycles</a>
    which comes in different sizes, from 36 points to 5 points. "

    could be considered an archetypal example of this style. It was designed for phone
    book directory listings -- very small type printed on thin low quality paper at
    high speeds. '
