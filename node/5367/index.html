  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this, but I was struggling to create this look. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions to create this cast-iron look. The picture looks like real metal, but I somehow doubt that NBC paid to have what looks like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-gothic/engravers-gothic/testdrive.html?s=SNL&amp;p=48" target="_blank">Engraver's Gothic</a> cast into a manhole cover just for this picture. Any idea how they achieved this &quot;distressed&quot; metal look?

		<div class="commentbody">My guess is it's real. It's certainly within NBC's budget to commission a metal sculptor to create a SNL manhole cover. I'd have tracked out the L a bit, myself. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, you can do some photoshop magic&hellip; filters, drop shadows, that sort of thing. If that's what they did, they did a pretty good job of it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It would be amusing to build up a foundry pattern out of wood cut-out letters and the sort of herringbone background pattern and take it to an iron foundry to have one cast made. I once had a press part made in iron, and the prices was surprisingly cheap. The part was a simple Colts Armory platen, about 15&quot;x21&quot;x2.5&quot;. The cost of the iron casting was around $125.   <BR> <BR>You would spend the lion's share of the budget in making the wood foundry pattern, and a lot of time with a rotary power brush distressing and aging the casting. Not an approach for the timid, but a valid one, and the results would be puzzling to all of your contemporaries; wondering how you Photoshopped it! On the other hand, you could go at it in Photoshop, and ignore my attempts at making trouble. <BR> <BR>Personally, I'd go for the pattern and casting. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, I'd believe NBC would spend the money without problem, but for one picture? If that is actually engraver's gothic, they'd would probably have to CNC the original out of wood or MDF, make a mold, cast it and then muck it up for the photograph. It just seems like an awful lot of trouble for one photo, which as far as I know, is used only on the site.  <BR> <BR>Anyone know how to achieve that look in PS? Nick, how'd you do it for the above picture? I've messed around with embossing and shifting the colors, and drop shadows but it doesn't seem to work. Any ideas are greatly appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd believe NBC would spend the money without problem, but for one picture? <BR> <BR>James &ndash; you underestimate the corporate mindset. A day in a professional photo studio costs in the neighborhood of $2K, plus art director time. Spending two grand on a project is nothing. Plus, the VP who authorized it gets a nice souvenir for his/her office. <BR> <BR>Conversely, if you hired a photoshop expert to mock it up for, say, 2 hours at $250 per, chances are the observant eye could still tell it was faked. And no souvenir! <BR> <BR>To Hector's point, I bet they upped the blue on the SNL just to make it stand out a bit more, but I still think it was a real manhole cover.</div>
