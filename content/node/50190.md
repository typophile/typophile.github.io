  of the actors' names?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hostage_4959.gif]\r\n\r\nType
  Navigator gave me David Berlow's Rhode Black Extended and Titled Gothic Extended
  Black. Close, but not it -- the mystery font's diagonal legs of the K and R curve
  up.\r\n\r\nI just saw this and 20 other choice title sequences at the Mill Valley
  Film Festival's presentation, \"Typecast,\" with designer David Peters. He couldn't
  recall the name of this typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    do. I'm guessing that because this is on myfonts.com as free it's legit?
