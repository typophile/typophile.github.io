  body: "You're looking for every \"i\" in the document? Or are you just looking for
    special ones, like ones in a certain font or style?\r\n\r\nThe \"Find/Change\"
    feature in InDesign works pretty much the same as it does in most other applications,
    except that InDesign gives you a lot more options. Be sure the \"text\" button
    at the top of the Find dialog box is chosen; otherwise you may be accidentally
    doing a different type of find (such as GREP); perhaps that's what's confusing
    you.\r\n\r\n"
