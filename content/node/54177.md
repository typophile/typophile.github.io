body: "Does anyone know the proper form of the \"apostrophe\" in an abbreviation of
  a year?\r\n\r\n\u2026as in '09. \r\n\r\nI'm getting mixed feedback on this from
  various applications; InDesign, Word, Text Edit, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm assuming this
  version is correct:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/09_3989.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut,
  when listed in sequence Word automatically switches it around to an apostrophe,
  prompting a client to bring this up:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/09-10_6381.gif]\r\n\r\nI've
  looked all over and can't seem to find anyone who addresses this in a typographical
  way. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    like crap and should be 2009 \u2013\_2010 if at all possible."

    further experimentation in Indesign, if I type '09 it actually renders a single
    quote mark instead of the correct apostrophe\u2026not good! I'll use the correct
    version from now on.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: "Word just doesn't have the smarts to tell when you want an apostrophe. All
    it does is look at what you type immediately before and after the straight-apostrophe
    key, and if you have white space or nothing-at-all before, it assumes you're starting
    a quote and turns it into an &lsquo;. If there's text before, it assumes you're
    either ending a quote or putting an apostrophe in the middle of a word, and turns
    it into a &rsquo;. It just can't cope with the concept of an apostrophe at the
    start of something, which is why it can't cope with fish \u2019n' chips either.
    But \u201909 is what you want, not \u201809.\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "Well, quite. Personally, I've trained myself to type ALT+0146 as fast as
    any other typing, and to pre-empt when I'm going to need to. :-D\r\n\r\nI'm looking
    at Word's built-in keyboard shortcuts: see what you get if you type CTRL+apostrophe,
    then release the CTRL and press apostrophe again. According to what I can see,
    that should also give you a hard \u2019 without invoking Word's \"is-this-really-a-quote?\"
    routine.\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver since I chose
