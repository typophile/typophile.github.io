  I find the lowercase for Century Gothic quite nasty. What are my alternatives?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Do you really find it nasty? I guess it can look a bit strange due to the
    slight extended/lopsided feel it has. \r\n\r\nI was at the snow over Christmas
    and I saw this sign quite a bit. I really despise the FHWA Standard Typeface,
    but used here it looks awesome, and the C is very circular without giving the
    modernist or Futura-esque feel.\r\n\r\nI believe it is FHWA Standard Series E.\r\n\r\n(Sorry
    for the iStockphoto, haha)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6094.jpg]"

    just too \"young.\" To me Century Gothic evokes childrens books and so on... not
    exactly what I'm going for."

  body: "Something a bit more modern than some mentioned above could be Adrian Frutiger's
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/avenir/\">Avenir</a>, or Avenir Next
    (I know they have differences, but I think most of the 'Next' font improvements
    are too subtle for me, especially at normal sizes, as a general observation of
    this recent Linotype genre).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
