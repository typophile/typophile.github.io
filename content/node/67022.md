body: Hi, I am new to this forum and a friend suggesting looking for help here. When
  I open dashboard and look for a definition, the answer comes up displayed with a
  phonetic version of the typeface. I just noticed this appearing in an email randomly
  as well. I assume it has something to do with a system font conflict, but can't
  trace it down. Any help would be appreciated.
