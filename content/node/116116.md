  Syrup lion does, seemingly unrelated to the product/company, but once you know the
  meaning behind them they tie up quite nicely.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Most folks in the U.S. aren't familiar with that brand and symbol, so it
    would be helpful to describe it further and what you mean by \"tell a story\".\r\n\r\nIn
    general you want a symbol that relates to the product in some way, but an unrelated
    symbol can be made to work if people associate it strongly enough with the product,
    or if advertising draws a connection. \r\n\r\nFor example the MGM movie studio
    lion originally had little connection with moviemaking (a lion was the mascot
    of the designer's college), but through association it became a well-recognized
    symbol."

    biblical story of Samson:\r\nhttp://britishfoodhistory.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/golden_syrup/\r\n\r\nSo
    looking for similar brands where their logo has a story to tell, not necessarily
    directly about the brand itself, but the principles behind the brand."

  body: "Nipper.\r\nFrancis Barraud inherited a friend\u2019s dog when he died, and
    also his gramophone with a recording of his voice.\r\nThe dog would listen to
    his dead master\u2019s voice through the horn, intrigued.\r\nBarraud painted this
    scene, and subsequently sold it to the Berliner gramophone company (perhaps inspired
    by Pears\u2019 use of Millais\u2019 \u201CBubbles\u201D).\r\nThis image of Nipper
    became the trademark of the Victor Company (the successor of Berliner), and then
    RCA (the successor of Victor).\r\nObviously, it symbolizes veracity of sound reproduction\u2014as
    well as the attraction of listening to the product. "

  body: A long time ago my grandfather owned a radio shop and RCA gave him a statue
    of Nipper to display in his store. It was a popular symbol back then. I've still
    got it somewhere.
