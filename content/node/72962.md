  but now it's back from the drawing board. I was so excited about the results, I
  thought it could deserve a new thread. Thanks to Justin_Ch and riccard0 for their
  thoughts on the original.\r\n\r\nAn all-caps face, Silverback was inspired by old
  stock certificates, bill heads, and other monetary documents.\r\n\r\nI'm in to process
  of importing the characters into a font program, so please excuse any spacing issues
  for now. I'm really just looking for thoughts on letterforms and how they work together
  (if they do at all).\r\n\r\nHere are the characters I have done so far, and the
  attached PDF includes some set text.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Silverback1_4760.png]"

    keep it from being read as an R.\r\nThe 5 looks too much like an S."

  body: "I like this, it's fun. I think it would be helped by some refinement of this
    recurring curve:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/silv_crit_4008.png]\r\n\r\nI
    would lower the gap some in C, to avoid G-ness.\r\n\r\nThe vast width of T might
    be a little offputting. You could try making the center stroke suddenly narrower
    at the top, like a table lamp, to make room to pull the sides in.\r\n\r\nTo stop
    5 looking like an S it will probably be necessary to do something to the top corners.
    Maybe take inspiration from Y."

    That curve <em>was</em> messed up. I tried a few iterations of it and stuck with
    a cleaned up version of the original.\r\n\u2022 Lowered the gap in the C. Better.\r\n\u2022
    Tried some variations with the 5 and came out with what's here. Using the caps
    of the Y proved to make it stick out like a sore thumb in the line up. I think
    it's different enough now that it doesn't bring on confusion.\r\n\r\nNow for the
    pesky T. I tried a few solutions and came out empty handed. But, it definitely
    isn't done. So, I've left it alone for now until a solution shows itself.\r\n\r\nIt
    still has a long way to go, but here's where things are right now. I've also posted
    a new sample to the original post. Next up, punctuation and more characters.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Silverback3_6235.png]"
