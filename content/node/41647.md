  a free font for use in a visual id/logo please? :O) I've tried to find contact details
  for it's creator to no avail and the licence info. on the free font site states
  that modification for repackaging or resale is not permitted but I want to be 100%
  sure what I've done is ok before it's published? :O) Any help or advice very much
  appreciated? :O)"

  body: "They're referring to if you were to take their font and change it slightly
    then resell it as if it were your own. If you're just using the font to create
    some words and you're tweaking letters that's fine. In fact that's pretty common
    when it comes to creating a logo.\r\n\r\n"

    the font name and owner on a forum like this - as proof you've tried, I don't
    think there will be a soul on Earth who would condemn you for doing this.\r\n\r\nThis
    use to be asked on all the shareware/charityware/beerware font sites - and it
    was pretty common. Also, you'd be amazed at how many might actually know the designer
    and put you in touch so you can rest... I feel like a Nyquil commercial now..."

  body: '<cite> Yeah, I agree with Asvetic. </cite> Yes, Andrew (Asvetic) is correct.
    The only caveat that I could think of ( and unlikely one at best too )  is if
    somebody makes a font free; but only for nonprofit use. Then if you make a logo
    for a nonprofit you would be 100% okay; but you would have to license the font
    for use in a commercial logo. It doesn''t sound like that is the case here though. '

  body: "I have been asked if I knew how to get in touch with Derek Vogelpohl (Shyfonts)
    several times. I don't know how to contact him, but did hear he went into a different
    line of work. \r\n\r\nI had a flash-back to my less jaded days when I came upon
    a Shyfonts t-shirt while going through my drawers recently. It must be verging
    on being a collector's item now. Unfortunately, I have found that many of my clothes
    seem to shrink for some reason, if I don't wear them for a long time. \r\n\r\nIf
    anyone ever has a museum to the wild and wooly days of free fonts ('98-'03?),
    I'll donate it."
