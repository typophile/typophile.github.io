		<div class="commentbody">Patty is right, the metaphor is mixed and is at odds with the copy. It has no call to action, there is a piece of information that on its own does not offer any answer (however small and insignificant), nor does it appeal for any assistance. The illustration isn&rsquo;t of a <em>rotting</em> steak, it seems fresh, why are there bites taken out of the uncooked meat – what does that say about aids or the number of casualties? Mozambique seems to have a Mickey Mouse shape chopped out of it. Some of the copy is superfluous, my feeling is that the headline message should reveal its meaning in as few words as necessary, it could read &ldquo;…than the total casualties in all wars…&rdquo;, for example.

<p>By the way, did you hear the story of the 2 Cats and the Monkey?
This story was set in my early education. Here it goes:
Two cats found a piece of food , but failed to share it. So, they went to the monkey to judge between them&hellip;
More than willing to help, the monkey divided the piece of food into 2 parts deliberately making one slightly bigger the other.
Raising his hands with the 2 halves, the Monkey said: 
&ldquo;Look! This is not fair, they should be equal&rdquo;.
So, he bit the bigger part deliberately making it slightly smaller than the other&hellip;
Again he raised his hands with the 2 pieces and said:<br>
&ldquo;Look! This is not fair, they should be equal&rdquo;.
In this way, the Monkey went over the piece of food leaving the 2 cats looking at each other.</p>

<p>Justice of the Monkey?!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What&rsquo;s the US election connection again?
Is the point to better manage the rotting of Africa?</p>
<p>Anyway:
The meat thing only works with respect to the shape of the continent, nothing else. One would naturally ask: How do I save this meat? Aha, by putting it in the fridge! So wait, does that mean we&rsquo;re supposed to cryogenically freeze Africa until a cure for AIDS is found? That can&rsquo;t be it - that would cost money. The only other thing would be to just eat the whole thing up right now, enslaving its population and pillaging its natural resources! Wait, we&rsquo;re already doing that&hellip;</p>
<p>And the type is way too cold.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can do better, since your heart is in the right place.</p>

<p>I did not see the meat or, even now knowing, see it as rotting. The flies just look confusing.  They make me think of something like killer bees or malaria or some agricultural problem. AIDS doesn&rsquo;t even begin to show without the text. You may need some human imagery&ndash;perhaps people partially hidden behind the African continent to show they are forgotten or diminished from western view.  AIDS strikes me as more personal a problem than a clinical looking drawing of a map can portray.</p>

<p>Hey, since I ride the fence between illustration and design, I&rsquo;m always interested in what the two camps think of imagery.  The image was selected for the American Illustration Annual book this year.  I put the poster up on an illustrator&rsquo;s blog site and it read VERY CLEARLY to everyone, and was liked very much.  But, what do illustrator&rsquo;s know anyways&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;right?</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback, I like hearing other points of views.  You can check out what artists thought about the image by going here:</p>

None of the comments on that blog entry actually explained what it was you think they read VERY CLEARLY. They said they liked it and thought it was clever but neither you nor they have explained why it is &lsquo;clever&rsquo; or relevant to AIDS in Africa (as opposed to any of Africa&rsquo;s other problems).</p>
<p>Even <em>if</em> the rotting steak image is perfect for the poster/campaign, (I agree with timd that) the meat in your illustration looks fresh (etc. etc. heckle heckle heckle).</p>
<p>One of the largest problems in the areas of Africa struggling most with the AIDS epidemic is a lack of (sex) education – there is still a common belief that sex with a virgin will cure a man of HIV. Once that problem is addressed, <em>then</em> they can start to think about how they would like their steak.</p>
<p>I really wish I liked the poster just so I could leave a post that said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Done&rdquo;.</p>

Also it&rsquo;s not obviously rotting - the flies would be attracted to a nice fresh cut of meat too, no? Type is not particularly interesting - seems odd that it was posted to typophile and the &ldquo;general discussion&rdquo; area in particular.</p>
<p>In the end I think it&rsquo;s an idea/metaphor that almost, but doesn&rsquo;t quite work, and you&rsquo;re forcing it. You could keep plugging away but my advice would be to ditch it and come up with a better idea. Back to the drawing board I think. ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hiro, I think you should learn how to spell poignant before you unleash the word in forums like this one. Also look up in a dictionary how it might relate to humanity.</p>
<p>Hrant, in terms of content, illustrators are generally <em> not </em> like photographers and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re just being as provocative as usual.</p>
<p>ER it doesn&rsquo;t suprise me at all that this image reads clearly to an illustration crowd and not-at-all to a typography forum, so I find myself agreeing with Simon. Although I like the poster visually and it&rsquo;s metaphors &lsquo;read&rsquo; to me, in spite of it&rsquo;s selection for the Illustration Annual (congratulations), the ideas behind it are incorrect. If the target of your poster was say, food hygiene rather than sexual behaviour, you&rsquo;d have nailed it.</p>
<p>As someone looking on from outside the US, I admire your call to vote.</p>

<p>Edel, I think your work is excellent. Thoughtful and well executed. This is why you are getting the big covers and recognition.</p>
<p>However, in this case, i think you have a good idea but the execution is not on par with your other work. I will try to make my criticism as constructive as possible.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type. It doesn&rsquo;t feel integrated with the concept. Just words typed on a page. I was looking at the <a href="http://www.drawger.com/edel/?section=gallery&gallery_id=181&image_id=3584">Defiance</a> poster on your site. Much better. The words fit in the soldiers ribbons and match the style. Somehow the type should be more integrated in the concept here, or should just be a caption below it. The picture should have it&rsquo;s own impact. It&rsquo;s a little bit of show and tell as is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empahsis. All the elements are emphasized the same. OK africa is red. But type, flies and Africa are all flat. Maybe what I&rsquo;m saying is that they&rsquo;re all at the same depth of field. I picture the flies closer and farther to the viewer. Maybe. It could just use more graphic impact. Are you emphasising the rotting meat or the nasty flies all over it? Neither at the moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The steak. I think the shape of africa is iconic enough without country lines. They distract from the rotteness of the meat.  Maybe simplify the continent shape (no bites?) and use the space to make it more rotten and meaty (introduce grey into the meat/blood juice?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Style. It seems too sterile to be rotting. I think it needs more texture like some of your other pieces.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for your involvement at typophile.
Hope that was helpful.</p>
<p>Randy</p>

		<div class="commentbody">ditto what randy said. he always has a way of putting everything together so succicintly. i think the main problem i have is that you can&rsquo;t really tell the steak is rotting, which your concept is really based on. this has to do with the color and the apparent firmness of the steak. if it were me the color would be a wash of deep red with some grey-green tainting portions of it and the steak looking considerably more mushy. but then again, i ain&rsquo;t no illustrator&hellip;</div>

<p>It is unfortunate (or perhaps fortunate depending on your point of view) when a Christian leader is exposed to be a hypocrite of the highest order. It is my belief that we are all hypocrites in the deepest sense. Wherever you set the bar, you can never get it low enough to clear it yourself. Our own words are more than enough to condemn us.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey, Chris, well, let me try something.  This was at the point with the CA cover where I tried to explain my work.  It then set off a historic chain reaction of events.</p>
<p>By the way, Chris, hrant, Hunt, Lore, West, all veterans of the CA cover thread - the image has gotten traction.  It&rsquo;s in the current CA design annual.  Yes, sounds corrupt, but the jury was neutral I suppose.  Nine judges from Design firms and such around the world picked it as one of the best images of the year.  But, what do they know&hellip;</p>
<p>Getting back to this one.  Thanks (most of you) for all the advice.  That feller Randy is one cool cat.  Gives some very nice thought out info.  Hrant is one cool cat too, in some other ways (i.e. sticking to the script) I kid Hrant, chill.</p>
<p>About the image, my thinking.  I&rsquo;m tired of little red ribbons and soft statements about helping this and that.  I wanted something raw to get people&rsquo;s attention.  I wanted it to be some street thing, not all sophisticated and fancy typework and all.  I felt like an over designed poster just didn&rsquo;t work for this.  I didn&rsquo;t want to render a grey steak or juice or whatever.  Just a red flat silk-screened image. bam. there it is.  I&rsquo;m tired of fanciness.  While we sit here on a forum discussing x-heights, Africa is rotting away and disappearing, why be all fancy with the cool fonts and the this and the that?  Just put an image down and stick some text on it. period.</p>

<p>Hiro, you&rsquo;re just backtracking totally from that earlier post. Either you mean to crit the guy (and not in a constructive way) or you mean to praise him (faintly); which is it?</p>
<p>As for <em>you have a problem with photographers too</em>. Heh. I&rsquo;ve briefed both kinds, but I&rsquo;ve never yet had a photographer get all uh, conceptual on me. They&rsquo;re generally happier just pointing and clicking. Illustrators (in my experience) agonise about narrative content, the &lsquo;truth of the medium&rsquo; and contextual reading, so yes, I think they actually do more in terms of content.</p>

<p>Ok, NOW you&rsquo;ve done it, Edel.</p>
<p>What a lame excuse for sloppy typography.</p>
<p>Futura is a very sophisticated font. If you wanted &lsquo;street&rsquo; you should have spray painted it or hand written it with chalk.</p>
<p>And how is centering the text&ndash;which makes it less readable here&ndash;very &lsquo;street&rsquo;? And does that irregular leading make it agressively &lsquo;street&rsquo;? And does the type enhance the impact of the illustration, or just wander around?</p>
<p>Oh, and are street thugs able to draw illustrations for the New York Times? Is your thoughtful concept and polished drawing very &lsquo;street&rsquo;? Give me a break.</p>

You are mixing images there sir.  The &ldquo;poster&rdquo; is this thread, which I definitely asked your input on.</p>
<p>The Che cover is a different matter and it is what I spoke about being in an annual.  I did not ask for input on that image myself.  It was put up by crazy machine gun cat man Eric West.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re cutting and pasting text, and confusing things.  &ldquo;this poster&rdquo; and &ldquo;image in design annual&rdquo; are two separate images.  Got it?  Word jumbling is annoying.</p>

I think it is fair to give you an honest crit but I don&rsquo;t feel it is either in good taste or even helpful to you to reconstruct your work without you&rsquo;re asking.  Even if what he had done was fabulous, I don&rsquo;t think it should be done. The purpose of a crit is to give the person a dialogue where they question what was done and even act as devils advocate to get you to see your own work more critically and with fresh eyes. It is up to you to then take or leave whatever is said and go back and do the work yourself.  It is still your work, not ours.  Even if we don&rsquo;t like your final product, above all, it is your work and that authorship should be respected. I don&rsquo;t think TimD intended any disrespect&ndash;he surely thought he was helping.  I just think his judgement was not what it should have been at that moment. It takes guts to put your stuff up on the web for thousands of strangers. You will however, not be able to control the input of others. The odds are you will get at least one response that is out of bounds.

Everyone had a stake in the process and your peers had the same project up on the wall too. There was discussion, even argument about approach as well as execution.  Sometimes there was laughter, sometimes applause, and sometimes tears. We all took our lumps and went on to do better, bruised egos and all.
This is the web though and we are all faceless and have no stake in your project.  As fellow designers, we should try our best to be helpful though. You did get some other comments to think about though. Perhaps there is more to be gained from looking at the better aimed comments than their is from dwelling too long on the stray bullet?</p>

Yes &ldquo;genius&rdquo; is just laughable, please. But, you know, I&rsquo;ll take it. :)</p>
<p>FYI, the folks on that blog are not groupies.  They are some of the top artists in the field.  It&rsquo;s as if Hoefler, or one of those big type people were here and said, &ldquo;hey Hrant, that&rsquo;s genius&rdquo;.  I think you would take it, no?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anything I do deserves boundless adulation.  I wake up and say I suck.  I do a drawing and think it sucks.  I&rsquo;m constantly thinking over things.</p>
<p>This Africa poster is something personal I did.  It&rsquo;s not like a poster for a cigarette company or something for god&rsquo;s sakes.  For someone to say it&rsquo;s &ldquo;sarcastic&rdquo; is kinda lame to me.  I don&rsquo;t know how many of the people commenting here have even thought of the issue or try to tackle it in a design.  If they have, then I&rsquo;d like to see it.  It&rsquo;s not an easy one.</p>
<p>On doing things to people&rsquo;s work, I&rsquo;ve been here on many occasions.  Have never even thought about it.  I think written suggestions are enough, everyone&rsquo;s fairly smart here.  If you want to make it clearer then there&rsquo;s a little contact thing where you can ask someone if it&rsquo;s o.k.  But, that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>I like your input, I&rsquo;m trying to get better at communicating to everyone, not just artists.  I&rsquo;ll probably put something new up soon, would like to hear what you think about it.</p>

<p>as for the piece itself, using a steak for symbolism seems like a bad idea. you&rsquo;re opening up such a huge visceral ballpark here and i think the message isn&rsquo;t going to really be felt for most people. for something like AIDS you want the message to be simple yet powerful. your illustration is just too ripe for misinterpetation. many of the responses so far are examples of it being misinterpreted. it&rsquo;s up to the designer to decide how many people &lsquo;don&rsquo;t get&rsquo; their design before they have to trash it.</p>
<p>lastly, it might even be offensive to some. there are still people living in africa, really we should be focusing on those still alive and how we can help them (and educate them - as has been said) rather than the incredibly depressing and immobilizing shadow of death that has been cast over the whole thing. you don&rsquo;t really think about helping a rotting steak with flies coming out of it. rather, you run away from it pinching your nose.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think putting the visual on a pedestal is a good idea. Hopefully the things we make aren&rsquo;t just pretty pictures - they have meanings, and meanings that cannot be separated from ourselves. The visual is just a layer of language, not a goal.</p>

Quite frankly I am angered by the line you used &ldquo;Just put an image down and stick some text on it. period.&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t suppose you will be willing to go back and respond to that or any other points and I understand that, after all you hadn&rsquo;t responded before to other questions.
As an experiment try removing the copy from your image and show it to a new audience ask them what they think it represents, I really doubt that Aids will be picked.

You can choose to be dismissive. But as <em>every</em> person here is giving you the same message on the use of type, wouldn&rsquo;t it be wiser to devote some time to further study of typography? (Eg., Bringhurst&rsquo;s great book, if you don&rsquo;t know it.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a story. Gershwin at the height of his popularity asked Stravinsky whether he could teach him orchestration. &ndash;At this point he had written &lsquo;Rhapsody in Blue&rsquo;, but had to have it orchestrated by someone else. Stravinsky asked him how much money he earned last year. Gershwin told him and Stravinsky laughed and said, &ldquo;I should be studying with you.&rdquo; Gershwin was serious in his question, though, and did find a teacher. As a result he was able to write his greatest work, &lsquo;Porgy and Bess&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>timd,
The &ldquo;questions&rdquo; come hard and fast, I try to get to what I have time for.  Sometimes, I am too busy shaking my head to answer them.  I am convinced that typographers and artists see things way differently.  Type folks are like architects, a lot of thought, breaking things down to minute detail.  An example from TimD, about the drawing of Africa right here:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mozambique seems to have a Mickey Mouse shape chopped out of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(Huh?  Shaking of head)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t answer sometimes, because that thing I just said about Typographers vs. artists will get about 10 typographers on my behind immediately.</p>
<p>I am not dismissive, I&rsquo;m just sitting back and seeing how you guys think.  You want a 1+1=2 kind of solution to everything.  Artists throw things together to provoke thought and discussion.  This image was not a &ldquo;hey, here&rsquo;s the problem, give money here&rdquo; type of thing.  It was meant to provoke some of the discussion that&rsquo;s happening right here.</p>
<p>About this:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Quite frankly I am angered by the line you used “Just put an image down and stick some text on it. period.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the work of a lot of artists, someone like Basquiat, or Barbara Kruger for example, it&rsquo;s part of what artists do.  Provoke, instigate discussion, etc.  No reason to be angry, it&rsquo;s part of the way I work, called &ldquo;emotion&rdquo;.  Sometimes, I work on an idea that comes to me within 10 seconds time, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Randy&rdquo; had some good points, I&rsquo;ll think about them.  I wanted the type to just be read as a fact, like a document.  I didn&rsquo;t want it overly designed, that was my point with the type.  I see people have problems with the type, I understand.  I mean, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Typophile&rdquo;, right?<br>
I wanted the poster image to be flat, not overly rendered, and I wanted all the elements to be on the same plane.  I feel silkscreened posters work very well like that.  Just flat, simple, like a document.  Pasted up on a wall somewhere is how I pictured it, something that might stop someone walking by and make them think.  Not give answers, just, make them stop and think.</p>
<p>If anything is off or anyone is insulted or anything, well, yeah, you should be angry, but not at me.</p>

<p>What does &lsquo;overly designed&rsquo; mean? If you mean some self-consciously trendy or elegant look, I agree that that wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate. But I don&rsquo;t think that that is what people here are advocating at all.</p>
<p>What we are talking about is <em>appropriately</em> designed, and serving the purpose is what good design is all about.</p>
<p>I may be wrong, but I get the feeling from what you write that you think that it is not worth putting much thought into typography&ndash;choosing an appropriate typeface for the task, and making it well sized and laid out in relation to the illustration. If that is in fact your view, I&rsquo;m not angry at all. I just think you are mistaken, and weakening your end product.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with William. Also on the point he made on a previous post (which wasn&rsquo;t commented by Edel): the composition doesn&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;street&rdquo; at all. Not a bit.</p>
<p>On the issue of Tim &ldquo;screwing up&rdquo; your piece: instead of going nuts with the whole community (and dragging the issue to other threads) you could have addressed him directly by simply asking him not to interfere in your pieces. Instead of calling him &ldquo;some dude I don&rsquo;t even know&rdquo; you could have checked Tim&rsquo;s history, you would have noticed that he&rsquo;s someone who does (and has done for a while) a fantastic job at Typophile, he&rsquo;s always willing to help, always pleasant and always consistent. Personally I would have been delighted if Tim had &ldquo;screwed up&rdquo; one of my pieces but there you go&hellip;</p>
<p>You mentioned that you were angry when you did the poster. Well, I fail to feel your &ldquo;anger&rdquo; and I don&rsquo;t think this is due to my inability to feel outrage at issues related to Africa. I think this is due to the ineffectiveness of the message. If you really want people to feel &ldquo;anger&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll have to try harder. I mentioned replacing the flies with vultures for example because vultures are so easy to associate with decay and most importantly with waiting (waiting for someone to die to take advantage).</p>
<p>Vultures are sinister creatures. Flies are just irritating.</p>
<p>Then I found this photo. Now <cite>that</cite> makes me angry. 
<img src="/images/old-images/abutre_5819.jpg" alt="">
Like Tim I was bothered by your comment &ldquo;Just put an image down and stick some text on it. period.” I really think the issue deserves a lot more commitment. Both: the issue of type and the issue of AIDS in Africa.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Edel,
I don&rsquo;t think the type is the issue for me&ndash;maybe because I spent 45 years as a graphic designer and only 2 as a type designer.  I don&rsquo;t even see the type as anything but a caption in the simplest use of the term. What I am trying to see is the image of a nice clean looking piece of steak as a provocative inquiry into Africa&rsquo;s AIDS problem. If I take the image of the map of Africa and raw steak, I get the image of wild animals fighting over raw meat. It also looks like one of those info-graphics you see in USA today where they might be showing the amount of meat produced in Uganda vs the amount of meat produced in The Gambia. Putting the flies in does not say to me rotting, it might say &ldquo;there is a fly in the ointment&rdquo; to indicate something is wrong but I don&rsquo;t see AIDS at all. The salient factor for me is that Africa has no oil and is a minimal purchaser of goods from developed nations. (They don&rsquo;t need a Lexus or a tanning salon, or a collection of Guy Lombardo&rsquo;s greatest hits, they need basic stuff and medical attention.) So the governments of developed nations of the world ignore Africa much more than the Middle East even if there have been systematic murders of thousands of people in Africa for years. We ignore African poverty, African genocide, as well as African health concerns including AIDS. 
Edel, who is angry at you? Not me, not anyone else here that I know of. You are right, we have different thinking patterns but so what, we can then learn more from each-other. I tend to think: audience, purpose, message, and then desired response wanted from the audience.  After that I think image.  Maybe you think image first? I don&rsquo;t know.  I would be curious how you apprach a job problem as opposed to a &ldquo;for yourself&rdquo; problem? Is there a difference for you?</p>

<p>Part of what&rsquo;s going on here is a problem with the medium. It takes time to communicate the tone of what you&rsquo;re saying correctly in a post (email also). So a quick burst can seem out of context, or angry or dismissive etc (and sometimes it is!). I don&rsquo;t know that it can be avoided. As with any advice given, you discover that you trust some and keep your salt handy for others. Hopefully all (or most) is thought provoking.</p>
<p>I find my wife is the best critic for me. She knows my thought process, but her angle is much closer to client than designer. And when she hammers my work I can&rsquo;t get too upset because tomorrow we are still married :-) And also, she is usually right.</p>
<p>WRT the AIDS poster: I really enjoyed the Wilco sketches on your site. I&rsquo;d be curious about what your sketches might look like here. I know you said this poster was done by gut feel so there may not be any &hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So far it seems to read like this:</p>
<p>You ask people what they think.
They tell you what they think.
You tell them that the image was selected for the American Illustration Annual book this year and then adopt a passive-aggressive tone with &ldquo;what do illustrators know anyway &hellip; right?&rdquo;.
People raise issues with the image that fail to get a response even when the same issues keep cropping up:
What do rotting meat or flies say about AIDS in Africa <em>or</em> about the West&rsquo;s neglect of the third world?</p>
<p>This is not because we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get it&rdquo; – because we can&rsquo;t get past our &ldquo;1+1=2&rdquo; mentality – this is not an &ldquo;Artists&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Designers&rdquo; thing as you continue to assert, this is about communication.</p>
<p>The word or image of meat is a heavily loaded metaphor that seems out of place here, and not in an intellectually provocative way.</p>
<p>If you intend to communicate (even part) of a complex problem with an image, you should be concerned about the fact that it seems to have caused confusion here, a forum for people who (often) work in the same field as you – 2D communication designed for print or screen.
You have also jumped to the conclusion that everyone here is a &ldquo;designer&rdquo; and therefore, in your view, not an &ldquo;artist&rdquo;. Aside for the fact that there are many &ldquo;artists&rdquo; and non-typographers here, where is the art/design line drawn? I certainly think that it&rsquo;s more blurred than you are making out.</p>
<p>Illustration can offer a means to communicate without language barriers. This is a major strength, but also a responsibility when dealing with sensitive (and enormous) issues such as this.</p>
<p>Nobody likse to have their work unfairly criticised and it&rsquo;s clear that you think this is the case here, but can you at least drop the &ldquo;us and them&rdquo; attitude toward Typophile users – you are creating divisions that needn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

Edel, my anger was provoked by your seemingly flippant remark about taking an image and putting text on it, not because the text was badly set (there are enough examples of really poor setting, yours doesn&rsquo;t sneak in the top 100) but because you seemed to be treating the subject with less respect than it deserves, which puzzles me given your obvious passion. If your purpose was to create discussion of a serious subject by creating a thought-provoking image, I am afraid my initial reaction remains the same – the image misses the mark, unfortunately the drawback of emotional responses is that they are not always successful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why one field thinks it’s great, and another thinks it’s garbage.
As an illustration I don&rsquo;t think it is garbage, just not the best solution. The lack of discussion here about the actual problem bears witness to that (not that I really expected it, part of the problem is that is so large that the individual is overwhelmed by it).</p>

<p>As for the typographers versus illustrators thing it seems to me you are seeing something that doesn&rsquo;t exist, nearly all of us on these forums have at some time or another worked with illustrators (or even as illustrators), I have never had a situation that led to duelling with scalpels behind the bike sheds:)</p>

I would never dare &lsquo;compare&rsquo; myself to Basquiat or many other artists.  I simply mentioned a well known artist that people might recognize to try and explain a point.</p>
<p>I also never called myself a &lsquo;genius&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The reason why people may hesitate to put their work up here in Typophile is that as soon as that happens people start taking everything out of context, as you have.  All of a sudden one is pictured as a guy that thinks he&rsquo;s GOD.<br>
I am just trying to figure out why people see things differently.  Why one person gets something right away and another person does not.  It&rsquo;s always intrigued me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep working to try and make sense to everyone.</p>

<p>Please explain to us all what we are missing – to help us &ldquo;get it&rdquo;.
You have been repeatedly asked to explain how the rotten meat and flies says something about the AIDS epidemic in Africa. This poster is exceptional enough to have been chosen for that illustration annual you mentioned, it must be strong enough to survive a little probing.</p>
<p>I know the message you are trying to communicate, but I need help in understanding in how this poster helps achieve your aim.</p>
<p>My fear – and I would like to be proved wrong – is that while <em>at first</em> it seems like a clever visual trick &hellip; aah yes, Africa <em>is</em> shaped a little like a steak &hellip; when you think about it (etc.)
But then &hellip; if you ask yourself &ldquo;why?&rdquo; it seems to unravel.
What connotations does meat already have?
meat is murder.
one man&rsquo;s meat is another man&rsquo;s poison.
treating people like meat.
meat as metaphor for greed and/or violence
meat as muscle or strength.
a &ldquo;meat-market&rdquo;.
and so on.</p>
<p>When you work with loaded material you have the opportunity to exploit the pre-existing semiology, or to play off it in new and exciting ways. I&rsquo;m not sure that your use of meat falls into either category (other comments in this thread have offered many explanations why, I won&rsquo;t go over them).</p>
<p>I know that the larger context of the poster is the West&rsquo;s neglect of the third world but you <em>specifically</em> focus on AIDS and <em>that</em> is where I see the problem between text and image in your poster.</p>
<p>The <em>text</em> says AIDS is a major problem in Africa (this is an awful truth)
The <em>image</em> possibly says &ldquo;Africa is rotting&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Africa is rotten&rdquo; which clearly problematic)
It could obviously say many other things (some have been previously suggested) and I hope you can explain the alternative reading that links it to AIDS and clear this up once and for all.</p>
<p>I also think that, with the exception of a couple of comments, people here have been polite and courteous in the face of your resistance to delve deeper into the strengths and weaknesses of this piece of work that you put up for critique.
You seem to have focussed on the fact that people don&rsquo;t like the work, rather than <em>why</em> they don&rsquo;t like it.</p>

<p>Well, in my [limited] experience this tends to happen almost everywhere.</p>
<p>I must confess that I have skipped a few posts here and there when comments started to go off-topic or become personal attacks, but can I ask you in earnest what your original goal with this thread was? Did you want honest criticism of your work or did you just want to show people something you&rsquo;ve done?</p>
