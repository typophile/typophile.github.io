  body: 'I think it is. Thanks! If it was custom does that mean it was never available
    for the rest of us? I did use it about a year ago in a design when I was taking
    a class. I don''t remember getting it from the macs at school, but am pretty sure
    I had the font on an old pc. It came with either Illustrator or Photoshop.  '

  body: I don't believe this font was ever made publicly available, at least not intentionally,
    and certainly would not have been bundled with CS. Maybe folks at HP leaked a
    copy that you happened upon?

  body: This is so strange and I wish I could solve this. I distinctly remember a
    classmate asking what the font was, but don't recall a name and HP psg or HP Personal
    Again do not sound familiar. In my web search I read that this may have been bundled
    with Illustrator at one time. If anyone out there knows...
