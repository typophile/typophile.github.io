  designed, simple, dark green walls. Obviously I wanted to do something relating
  to the courtyard, but I didn\u2019t want to use a tree.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nLee\r\n"

  body: Thanks for the comment. Here's an improvement hopefully, while still keeping
    it hand drawn.... or maybe I should get rid of the hand drawing and go with something
    smoother altogether...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/leaf2_6295.jpg]

    wonder how the whole icon might look in a lino/woodblock print style ... i.e,

  body: what bothers me is that the logo is ALMOST the width of the <em>'Courtyard'</em>,
    but not quite.

    to actual green or green-blue?

  body: "okay, I don't know your process, so I don't want to sound preachy or anything;
    I'm trying to help.\r\n\r\nI see what you're doing but to me it feels like you
    are taking a couple shots in the dark and hoping you hit something.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is your Strategy?\r\n\r\nWe know what the place is cafe in a courtyard.\r\n\r\nWhat
    type of food do they offer?  What sort of atmosphere...what sort of museum is
    it in?\r\n\r\nThen: what 2 or 3 words do you most want to communicate with your
    logo?  If you were trying to describe the feel of the logo to a blind woman what
    words would you use to describe the abstract message of it.  (is it traditional
    or modern, is it fast-paced or laid-back? questions like this)\r\n\r\nThen: what
    imagery, related to Caf\xE9s fit that message you are trying to send out?  How
    can you make them work for you, how can you bring consistency to your design.
    \ What font fits well with your graphic element?  Gill Sans is a wonderful typeface,
    but it isn't universally the best ever.  Also, identity design tends to have thicker
    or beefier signatures so the text can be visible and read from a long way away.\r\n\r\nI
    think you can do this, I think you've shown you have all the skill you need to
    make a stellar logo that will have them drooling, I just feel like you need to
    suit up and put your armor on and head into battle with a plan and a goal.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck!"

  body: "Sorry it took me so long to check back. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your
    truly thoughtful response Innovati! You are right, I'm going about this in a very
    lazy fashion.... shot in the dark style. \r\n\r\nI'm honestly not that inspired,
    partly because I was under the impression that I have to use Gill Sans, but I
    think that I should branch out. I am going to start from scratch, using the questions
    you asked (perhaps ignoring that the logo is mainly meant to appeal to an \"older
    wealthy woman\" demographic) and start with something that I can confidently stand
    behind. \r\n\r\nHere I go.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
