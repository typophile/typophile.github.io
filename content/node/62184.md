  body: Seems like they -- whoever it is -- made some improvements on Giza. Don't
    get me wrong... Giza is rad. But if you do a <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=giza&x=24&y=12&sample_text=HOUSE%20OF%20HOOPS&sample_size=36">side-by-side
    comparison</a>, you can see improvements to the negative space in the H, E, F,
    and P. To my eye, some of the characters still seem a little wide. But I really
    dig this font.
