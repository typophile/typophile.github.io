body: "You notice, in the font Alpha Mack, there are lots of blank glyphs, like \u2020\xA7\xB6\xDF\u2122\xB5\xF8\xAC\u0192\u201C\u201D\u2018\u2019\xF7\u2021\xB7\u201A\u201E\xA6\xDE\xFE\xB9\xB2\xB3\xBD\xBC\xBE\u0141\u0142\u2260\u2211\u222B\u03A9\u221A\u0394\u25CA\u2044\uFB01\uFB02
  and evenly Apple. The fl ligature, in Gulim was drawn incorrectly. The thorn was
  similarly used for Icelandic, but you haven't used it. Alpha Mack even has blank
  small \xD8, where you use Complete Composites to make the missing contours glyph.
  You mean, AOE has added \u017D\u017E to the fonts. If you have FontCreator, select
  the glyphs, trademark and oslash, which is circled as empty glyphs. And click Complete
  Composites at the toolbar. Because you mean, you have a blank glyph named quoteleft
  and quoteright. It's just needing empty glyphs will change to simple glyphs when
  imported. If you have the empty fraction slash, just click the empty glyph, called
  fraction, then use Complete Composites. Make the glyph simple, then move the slash
  with Shift-Click. Use the glyph transformer script, called Superscript. It will
  add the missing \xB9\xB2\xB3 glyphs and the missing superscript four to nine glyphs.
  Cut the glyphs with the PS names onesuperior, twosuperior and threesuperior. Use
  the glyph transformer script called Superscript. Then select OK. Use Ctrl+E to paste
  the PS names. When you launched the glyph transformation script, just fix the superscripts.
  You validated the superscripts. But, you selected a intersecting coordinate in the
  glyph \xB2 and fixed it. But you removed off-curve extreme coordinates, contours
  with one or two points and redundant points over the glyph \xB3. Then you removed
  the intersecting coordinate over the glyph \xB3. Then the glyph \xB3 became no problems
  detected. You remove the off-curve extreme coordinate and the redundant point over
  superscript four and removed the superscript fix. You removed 3 points from superscript
  six and fixed the glyph. And added on-curve extremes, removed redundant points,
  contours with one or two points and fixed an intersected coordinate over superscripted
  seven. Superscript eight has no problems, but narrator speaks the number eight.
  You have an off-curve extreme coordinate and have a redundant point over superscript
  nine and removed the point. You remove 2 contours over superscript + glyph. Then
  removed the other points. You also have a contour with unknown direction for minus
  superscript symbol. And removed the others for superscript equal symbol. You removed
  3 points from superscript six and fixed the glyph. And added on-curve extremes,
  removed redundant points, contours with one or two points and fixed an intersected
  coordinate over superscripted seven. Superscript eight has no problems, but narrator
  speaks the number eight. You have an off-curve extreme coordinate and have a redundant
  point over superscript nine and removed the point. You remove 2 contours over superscript
  + glyph. Then removed the other points. You also have a contour with unknown direction
  for minus superscript symbol. And removed the others for superscript equal symbol.
  Then sorted glyphs by Macintosh ordering. You selected empty glyphs called onehalf,
  onequarter and threequarters and used Complete Composites to complete the glyphs
  called \xBD\xBC\xBE."
