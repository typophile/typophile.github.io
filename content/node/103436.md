  Typefoundry Amsterdam was ever digitized? I believe that Linotype should have the
  rights to it but I can't find it on there website.\r\n\r\nI can't even find a highres
  sample online.\r\n\r\nAny high quality fonts that might be an adequate substitute?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n"

    me with at lest, some, much needed assistance. I am afraid, however, that this
    is yet another cases of an already overworked creative being asked to deliver
    yet more work that is done fast, is grate and for no compensation. "

    the only digital version is the light and medium version from Dennis Ortiz-Lopez.
    I compared it with the one in my specimen from LA and I think he should never
    called it Egmont. I think there is too much difference and it hasn't got the finesse
    the original has. The \u2018W\u2019 and \u2018w\u2019 are terrible! The Italic
    is totally different but he said already that this was not made to look like the
    one from De Roos."

  body: "For a metal type this was a difficult design to produce and use. The little
    wedge type pieces are obviously designed to float clear of the main strokes. In
    use the type would soon be stressed and the wedges would be pushed into the main
    stroke, or pushed outwards. Where digital versions are based on different impressions,
    this should account for the variation in appearance. As for the R, I don't know
    if it's a redesign or a font size difference.\r\nA proper digital version would
    be a real treat!\r\nDon"

  body: It is already a font, be it in an early beta phase and in need of a lot of
    work on small details. And, yes, those specimen sheets did help. When finished,
    as you say, good for print only but should go well as initials with the Egmont
    Mager I think.
