  body: "This is an old 19th century (I think) typeface named Bijou (a.k.a <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/bangle.htm\">Bangle</a>)
    which has been 'embellished' with extra bits to make it sort of Jokerman-like.
    Bijou is shown in the Solotype Catalog (p.12).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    but you got it exactly, and it shows up in a number of places around the web.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Yep - it shows up in lots of places I couldn't point to ('cause of other,
    illegitimate fonts). I guess I should have put a (sic) after the spelling, eh?
