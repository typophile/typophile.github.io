  velox output to white paper. Crisssssp black-on-white. The problem is that these
  services have become extremely hard to find. Even if you manage to dig up pricing
  for those services on a website, chances are very high that when you contact them
  they'll say \"we don't do that any more\". However, after a couple of dozen calls
  and emails I have some good news!\r\n\r\nThe least expensive place I've found so
  far is this:\r\nhttp://www.dsbureau.com/cat03.php _\r\nIt's in Houston, Texas. I'm
  in the process of asking them how much\r\nit would cost to mail the output within
  the US, and how they would\r\npackage it to avoid damage.\r\n\r\nAnother place I
  found was in Madison, Wisconsin:\r\nhttp://www.porttoprint.com/imgsttng.html _\r\nThe
  guy is very friendly, and has already agreed to: lower the price for tabloid prints
  to $20, for the 2400dpi output; and mail the output within the US for less than
  $5, with proper protective packaging.\r\n\r\nIf you get in touch with one of those
  places please let them know I referred you.\r\n\r\nI also actually found a place
  in LA that does velox, but he charges $20 per letter-size output, and you have to
  have a film of the page made first, which costs around $15 ($20 at their place),
  plus that makes it second-generation. The only advantage of velox is that the paper
  is thicker (AFAIK), so it's probably not worth it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Why don't a bunch of you type guys buy it from him and then just figure out how
    to run it and keep it running. ;^)

    equipment that needs to be sold.

    units as more and more printers migrate to CTP (computer-to-plate) technology.
    As handsome as RC apper output is, it comes with a knotty problem: the chemistry
    used to develop and fix the paper, which need to be disposed of properly. Fixer
    is normally processed to extract the silver it contains, and people who do this
    for a living often will take it off your hands for nothing. Exhausted developer,
    on the other hand, is really nasty stuff and has no commercial value.'
