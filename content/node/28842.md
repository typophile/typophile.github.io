  am dealing with a file originally made in FL4.6.\r\nWhen I work on the kerning or
  classes if I close the file and reopen it, the changes are gone!\r\nI also have
  a weird thing with the sidebearing of \"N\": both show '0' values. If I change them,
  after I close and reopen the values are set again to '0'!\r\n\r\nIs there any similar
  documented problems or bugs in FL5.02?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nRamiro Espinoza."

    in the menu and apply 'update kern feature' in kerning assistance, and 'apply
    and save' in the metrics assistance.\r\n\r\nHave a look at the metrics class in
    the classes panel. The N is probably referenced to a (or 2) character(s) that
    have a sidebearing value of zero.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nAs far as I know the \u2018update kern feature\u2019 command
    is for Open Type production. I am designing just a PS1 font.\r\nAnd I don't see
    why should I 'apply and save' in the metric assistance window when I am doing
    it already in the classes window.\r\nI've checked every metric class and there
    is no reference to the glyph 'N'.\r\nI am really puzzled.\r\n\r\nI have had problems
    with FL 4.6 in the past but not the amount of problems I am having now with FL5.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "OK... Now I've solved the problem by making a new file under FL5 and copy/pasting
    all the characters. I imported the metric data from an AFM.\r\nNow everything
    works fine, so the problem seems to be that FL5 have problems dealing with old
    FL4.X data.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if Adam Twardoch is aware of these issues...\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your comments and advice."
