  body: "Ah, \"endswash t\". So this is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/splendid-quartett/splendid-ornamenty/\">Storms
    Splendid ornamenty</a>, a weight of the Splendid Quartett. The endswash t should
    be under the letter \u2206. \r\n\r\nThis is what the PR-department wrote about
    it: \u201EThe traditional division of a type-face family into four designs pertains
    to every body type. However, jobbing typography calls for a richer tonal scale.
    Its purpose is to decorate, to represent and to please. Splendid Quartet is an
    example of a combination of heterogeneous sources of inspiration into a single
    harmonious formation. An American-style script is accompanied by a subtle English-type
    Roman type face with a bold design. The whole is reinforced with a Germanic Grotesk.
    The designs as such do not surpass the significance of their models, but the real
    charm of this family consists in the sensitive interplay of perfect, even though
    antagonistic shapes.\r\n\r\nPure elegance, refinement and gracefulness radiate
    from this quartet of type faces. The basic design is a paraphrase of Didot, but
    it is also inspired by Modern, a type face of English provenance. The details
    of the serifs, however, are not rounded, but left in a coarser, more interesting
    engraved form. The semi-bold sans-serif type face resembling Akzidenz Grotesk\xAE
    works in contrast, similarly as the bold designs of Lexon.\r\n\r\nSplendid Script
    functions in this case as italics, having the same x-height of lower-case letters
    as the basic design. The script was freely transcribed from the pattern-book of
    the New York Type Foundry from 1882, paying regard to numerous other sources of
    that period. This resulted in a blend of balanced typographical flavours, as if
    a connoisseur smoker had blended together some fine tobacco. It is by far the
    most fitting material for graphic design of festive printed materials and an ideal
    supplement to engravings and etchings.\u201C\r\n\r\n"
