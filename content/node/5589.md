    is your resized sample, and right is the character from  <BR>MyFonts &#40;in red&#41;
    overlaid on your sample.  If they said it isn&#39;t  <BR>Zapfino, they definitely
    need their eyes checked. <BR> <BR>Chesh, you owe me one next time we meet. <IMG

  body: Back to the subject. I looked at the Zapfino family and tried to find any
    other close looks &#40;skimming through the Yellow Book&#41;. Then I threw in
    two well-known elegant style scripts just for comparison. Admittedly, e is not
    the most distinctive letter in a script font, but at this size it&#39;s hard to
    argue with Yves.  If this is NOT the answer I&#39;d like to see whether someone
    found a Zapfino rip-off. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40532.gif"

    with another name?</i> <BR> <BR>If so, it would be a knock-off/pirated/rip-off
    version. Zapfino is a very distinctive typeface designed by one of the world&#39;s
    most revered living type designers, Hermann Zapf.

  body: I have seen a number of these font identification games, because I was asked
    for help many times, and this wouldn&#39;t be the first time that someone used
    a renamed rip-off version of a font and thought it was something original. Most
    casual font fans are more familiar with the &#39;free&#39; versions of things
    than the originals they are based on, and they don&#39;t even know that an original
    exists.  <BR> <BR>I suspect that&#39;s what&#39;s happened here. <BR> <BR>&#40;This
    is the reason I always try to show the true font names and designers in my Script
    Guide.&#41;

  body: Sorry, Maria. I &#40;we&#41; don&#39;t support the idea of ripping off fonts,
    and it would be proper and ethical if you wouldn&#39;t either. What you are talking
    about is font piracy, because there are no authorized &#39;free&#39; versions
    of Zapfino.

  body: You can have a version of Zapfino if you purchase a macintosh computer with
    OS X. Or if you have a mac upgrade to OS X. But this is more expensive than licensing
    the typeface. hehehehe. ROFLOL
