  relatively low sizes of 6&7. I have come across two fonts which are clear and maintain
  the readability. They are the Garamond Premier Pro Caption and ITC Berkeley.\r\n\r\nI
  would really appreciate if some of you can suggest me a few more. Please do mention
  a few Sans serifs too along with the serifs.\r\n\r\nTIA"
