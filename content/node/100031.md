body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am trying to \"fix\" a font in fontographer, the problem is that
  the characters are set too wide apart and unless I turn on optical kerning in PS/InD
  it looks like a disaster. Since I have to pass the font to the client to use for
  titles in presentations etc. I want to try to fix these issues so they don't have
  to manally set these properties, and most of the software they use (PPT etc) don't
  even have those options. \r\n\r\nI managed to fix the tracking issue, but not the
  kerning - is it possible to somehow \"force\" optical kerning when I export the
  modified font?\r\nI'm not that good at Fontographer so I'd try to avoid manually
  setting the kerning for all characters + I think it would take me 2 weeks to finish
  it and it would still look bad.. :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n"

    sit down and space the font properly... Not everybody's cup of tea, and it takes
    more time/expertise than many people think.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "As far as I know, no.\r\n\r\nHere's a trick I don't use, but does work resonably
    well. Find a font that looks similar, but is spaced and kerned much better.\r\n\r\nCopy
    the left and right sidebearing values into your font. Not the widths, the sidebearings.
    With Fontographer, I believe you'll have to do this by hand, but it won't take
    as long as you think.\r\n\r\nNow import the kerning from that parent font.\r\n\r\nIf
    you don't have much experience, you'll be a lot closer than if you just start
    from scratch.\r\n\r\nAs for manually refining the kerning, use a long string of
    characters. I put something like\r\n\r\n the pae<strong>aa</strong>eiling evehnory\r\n\r\nin
    the metrics window. Get the fit of the characters other than the pair show in
    bold at least reasonable. The pair I've shown in bold are the pair I'm kerning.
    (You don't use bold, of course.) So, to work on \"a\", keep advancing the second
    (shown in bold) character from \"a\" to \"z\", changing the kerning as needed.
    Now change the first shown-in-bold to \"b\" and repeat the process.\r\n\r\nAs
    you go, you may see an opportunity to cut down of the number of kern pairs by
    changing a sidebearing value. If you do, you'll have to rekern that character...\r\n\r\nYou'll
    also want to include punctuation with each alpha character, and punctuation with
    itself (period+quotedblright, for example).\r\n\r\nSpend time on the numbers --
    pretend you're setting three digit page numbers, or four digit dates. Have a couple
    short words with the wordspace in the metrics window along with the numerals.
    \r\n\r\nIt sounds daunting, but I can kern all the alphas, upper & lower case,
    the punctuation, and the numbers in about 6-8 hours. Not a short period of time,
    but not two weeks, either.\r\n\r\nGenerate your font, set a page or two of text
    at a size that will be typical of the size used, and print that out. Fix anything
    obviously wrong.\r\n\r\nThat should be a pretty good start."

  body: "So as noted above, \"no\", there's no way to force optical kerning as the
    default. \r\nAt first I thought you wanted to modify the kerning in the font,
    which would be easy enough to do with a python script in Robofont or Glyphs or
    Fontlab. \r\n\r\nBut if the kerning is bad or non existent, you need to fix it
    manually. \r\n\r\nI would suggest that you sub it out to someone to do the kerning
    for you. There are many folks here who could do it quite quickly, and it'd be
    worth your while, i think. Although truth be told, I'm not one of them. ;)\r\n\r\nJason

    a fair bit. What does it costs to get your furnace fixed when it's Sunday morning
    and 20-below outside?\r\n\r\nThis may not be the time, but some of these tradesmen
    skills are worth having, and not only because the work costs if you sub it out."

  body: "<blockquote>we charge a fair bit.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nLike how much would
    you charge to have a plain font with let's say 200 chars fully spaced and kerned?\r\n\r\nA
    skill is worth having yourself if:\r\n- You need it often enough.\r\n- You have
    no natural impediment against it; I've encountered people who simply don't have
    what it takes to do spacing properly and/or really hate thinking in the ways a
    spacer needs to. Everybody needs help with something sometimes.\r\n- It makes
    you happier!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Yeah, I didn't imply that it'd be cheap, but worth doing. Although if the
    font needs to be respaced as well as kerned, even the "pros" might not be able
    to hit your deadline
