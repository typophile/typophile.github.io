  you know what font is that one? It seemed like a custom one, but the \"s\", \"c\"
  and \"a\" are identical so I think it's a font."

  body: I doubt it's custom. All the letters are the same except the two C's, which
    are next to each other, so it could be a ligature, or hte designer customized
    one so they don't look the same. The letterforms are nice and smooth and well-proportioned,
    but the swashes of the /P/D/A/ all connect to the circle with awkward angles (especially
    the /A/). I think a not-so-detail-oriented designer got a hold of a script typeface
    and did this, but I just don't know what typeface it is. Looks like something
    from Veer.

  body: "I agree with Steven. I would suggest that the second 'C' is a swash alternate
    'C', and that the 'A' could be an upside-down 'V' overlapping the swash from the
    'C'.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Possible. However: while differences between repeating characters can be
    an indicator for lettering (with lots of exceptions), keep in  mind that this
    is not so clear the other way round. In lettering \u2013 especially when it\u2019s
    digital \u2013 it is very easy (and common) to copy and reuse glyphs."
