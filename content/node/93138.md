  know what this font is (Sahara Bodoni), but I'm looking for other options in this
  vein. Modern with very thick thicks and thin thins. And I'm really just looking
  for the numbers \u2013 have to be beautiful. And it would be a bonus if there's
  anything that's not quite as extended as Sahara, even though I love that they're
  fat, the application I need them for wants two-digit combinations to be closer to
  square than rectangular/horizontal.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

    considering (though some of its figures are also a bit unusual).

    body: Ambicase Fatface Poster OT might have a little too much personality for
      what I need, but I think it's a contender. Lots of options here. Thanks, everyone.
