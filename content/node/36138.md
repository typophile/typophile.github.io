  i didn't know the name - i found out today that the typeface in question is FF Dax
  and has a similar cousin under the name of FF Sari.\r\n\r\nJust wondering if anyone
  has any ideas as to the best place to buy this font family\r\n\r\nAlso, what is
  the general consensus? Is it already over-used, or is it a viable option for the
  right project? I think it would work well in a professional context maybe with another,
  subtle sans-serif based font... \r\n\r\nAny ideas would be appreciated!!\r\nThanks,\r\nJeremy

    a normal thing, because it is nearly a classic \u2026). But that does not mean,
    there isn't a new sight on it possible. \r\n\r\nYou can buy Dax, Sari at www.fontshop.com\r\n\r\nPS
    Do you know Daxline, a face from the same typedesigner?"

  body: "Hey Jeremy,\r\n\r\nThe typographer.org posted a review about Daxline some
    time ago - I just stumbled across it today because we are in the super preliminary
    stages of a corporate redesign. The other designers and I are nearly in open revolt
    against FF Meta - bless Spiekermann, but I never want to see this face again -
    and were considering Daxline. Daxline was intended for text use, but we liked
    the proportions so much, I think we may try it out at display size a few times
    to see if we need to purchase Dax.\r\n\r\nVinney\r\nhttp://www.typographer.org/archive-condensed-2005november.html"

    seems to loose some of the merits of the original Dax--the individuality and sweetness--though
    you might not get tired of it as soon. If you wanted a more usual look, I'd think

  body: Technically "stemless" is surely incorrect, but those unfamiliar with proper

    Spur is ok, but maybe there's something better. I've been wondering about this
    too.

    Everything Kris draws is so damn pretty. However, I must admit I like the heaviest
    weight of Karbon best, where the cutting of the stems or spurs--or whatever the
    heck they are--seems to have more visual reason to it.\r\n\r\nThat whacky alternate
    a I must admit pulls the face together as far as visual logic, but maybe is too
    far out for a lot of use... \r\n\r\nps. Kris, have pity on us and on your site
    give us non-Maori speakers--almost everybody--some samples in English, French,
    or German. It is very hard for me at least to really judge a typeface if I can't
    read it, instead of just looking at it. "

    see Dax in a similar light. It is a bit self-conscious and \"high-concept\" (borrowing

    is about Dax's reductive design qualities. Simple is good, but the omission of
    spurs make Dax a champion of reductive modernism. The face's popularity makes
    it influential for other typeface designs. That bugs me because I'd rather live

    Primex two of my early type designs from a time when I didn't know better. Making
    them taught me <em>why</em> reductive design is a dead end : )\r\n\r\nIn that
    sense, having made them qualifies me to recant and be critical of reductive design
    years later. I've been there and done it, and recoiled.\r\n\r\nPrimex suffers
    less from reductive properties than Ganymede does. Primex is benefits from its
    simplicity, whereas Ganymede seeks to disappear up its own arse. Its capitals
    have uses but its lower case is apparently pointless.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the terms
    of use for the Myfonts site prohibits distribution and external use of font samples
    generated by its test-drive feature. Please read the Myfonts site terms of use
