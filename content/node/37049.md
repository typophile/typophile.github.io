  ode to nothing...well it was nothing!  No ink was to be used.  However the shadows
  of the font were to be cast onto the paper creating an architectural 3 dimensional
  structural look.  \r\n\r\nAnyone have any experience with this who could explain
  to me the mathematics of what font size and weight is needed to pull off the nothing...but
  something look?"

  body: "As a letterpres printer I will tell you that a male and female die must be
    created to give you the sculptured look. The 3 dimensional effect is done by altering
    the depth of the female die. This is a hand engraving for the die maker similar
    to the die and punch maker for minting coins. Sometimes the male die is created
    by making an impression on the tympan of the press that has a layer of soft material
    the will harden after the impression is made from the female. Am I getting too
    technical?\r\nTry taking a coin or key and pressing it into soft putty and you
    will see what I mean about a female die.\r\n\r\nNo math involved!"

  body: I think Robert's nailed it here. The nice, hard edged effect it sounds like
    you're after would be best when created with a male and female set up. What stock
    were you using for the job? This plays a huge part as well.

  body: "This is one of those things everyone seems to learn the hard way. Everyone
    seems to.\r\nRobert nailed it. Next time do some research with other designers
    here or elsewhere which provider should be used for this type of job. It is a
    craft that though many may offer the service not many knows excactly how to do
    it right. We are talking the right paperstock, humidity, male and female die,
    amount of pressure etc etc. Make sure you find the ones who do it right. Myself:
    I'll send that kind of job to a specialist in the other end of my country or overseas
    just to make sure it's handled right.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The stock is indeed very important. When I embossed something myself on a
    letterpress, I didn't have access to a male-female die, I went with just a photopolymer
    plate, and raised it quite alot on the press so that it would emboss. I didn't
    have to do anything fancy for it to work, only sturdy enough stock and enough
    raise on the press / pressure. This way an impression is made only on one side
    of the stock. [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/11494488@N05/1324516028/|See the
    result here]]. \r\nI did use a <em>very</em> slight drip of clear ink or satin
    varnish.\r\nWith thinner stock you probably would have to use a male-female die."
