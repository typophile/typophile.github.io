  \r\n\r\n>Next, what are font points? Points are the unit of measure used \r\n>in
  sizing fonts. Each point represents 1/72 of an inch in height. \r\n>This was originally
  decided in 1737 and was later adopted in the \r\n>United States in 1871 after the
  great Chicago fire. Why after the \r\n>fire? Because one of America\u2019s largest
  printers had their main \r\n>plant destroyed in the fire. They thought, \"What better
  time to \r\n>develop a standard and get the rest of the printer-world to follow
  \r\n>our lead?\"\r\n\r\nAny truth to this? Can't say I heard it before. What was
  John Warnock doing in Chicago in 1871 anyway?\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n"

    measurements in the late 19th century. But the British then got pissy about not
    being the ones who designed the measurements; they then created the current point/pica
    system. I believe that I read it in Megg's <em>History of Graphic Design</em>,
    but I don't have a copy at home so I can't look it up.\r\n\r\nAs for how the current
    system came to the US, it seems that the US would have been following whatever
    Europe was doing up to at least the early 1900s, because the US was importing
    much of its type from Europe. I guess that I'll have to ask the author for his
    sources so I can look this stuff up..."

    not quite equals an inch. That was the good old metal type days.  Along comes
    digital in the mid 80s and the software folks take over. Some guy named Warnock
    decides that this incredibaly small fraction between an inch and 6 picas isn't
    worth screwing with and just changes it in some wierd software thingy called PostScript
    and, DANG! There ya hav' t folks :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    is probably more than you wanted to know about the evolution of the 'point'. James
    Mosley tells me the French inch was larger than the English inch, so the Didot
    and English points are different, and accroding to the article the Americans had
    a 'Printer's foot' that was less than a standard foot and then in 1886 ... \r\n\r\nNever
    mind :)  "

    I wonder if, had the French and English inches been the same, would the resultant
    lack of British jokes about Napoleon's height have preserved peace between the
    countries, leaving Napoleon free to dominate continental Europe? "

    \u2018Typographic unit\u2019 in Wikipedia, it has the whole story, pretty exactly
    (as it so often does). Especially if you follow up its reference to S\xE9bastien
    Truchet and google a bit with his name. And I\u2019m glad Adobe cleared up that
    messy definition of the US point. I could never remember how it went, and the
    English inch and mile and all that stuff feels more natural, somehow."
