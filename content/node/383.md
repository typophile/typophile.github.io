  body: Make up your mind about the typefaces! Just Matrix Script and Base are enough,
    I think. The front of the card is quite minimal compared to the back, and yes,
    I do think the back is a bit too much. Remember the orange is going to become
    quite muddy when printed over the brown stock. Do you really think people are
    going to use it as a postcard?

  body: whenever I hear of someone using multiple Emigre  <BR>fonts I&#39;m interested
    to see what sort of mess they&#39;ve  <BR>gotten themself into. I agree with Keith,
    the front is  <BR>minimal, and I think it works. try to carry your delicate  <BR>minimalism
    to the back. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m confused as to why you felt the need to introduce  <BR>Base
    9 when you already have Akzidenz Grotesk &#40;my  <BR>first-glance guess&#41;
    to contrast Matrix Script. again, I  <BR>agree with Keith; dump Base 9 and play
    that post-mod  <BR>italic off of your nice 19th cent grotesk! <BR> <BR>one more
    thing, if this is a standard size business card  <BR>&#40;which it appears to
    approximate&#41; then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s  <BR>viable as a postcard by
    USPS regs. <BR> <BR>oh yeah, last thing, where did that second italic come  <BR>from?
    dump that one too and use the grotesk in its  <BR>place.

    twice, the outcome should be nice. otherwise,  <BR>keep Keith&#39;s advice in
    mind when designing and  <BR>presenting to avoid a surprised &#40;read: upset&#41;
    client.'

  body: I like the front, and although I don&#39;t mind the two sides having different
    moods, I also don&#39;t like the back as it stands. Also, on the front I would
    set the &#34;the&#34; in a smaller size of the &#34;HUDSON BEACH&#34; font, not
    the script. <BR> <BR>As for who would use it as a postcard, I think the cafe itself
    could use it that way effectively; there&#39;s something romantic about getting
    a postcard. As long as it&#39;s not from a dentist. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    The machines will choke on them and the post office probably would refuse them
    outright &#40;learned this the hard way with my wedding invites ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>The

    with your local post office and get the latest mailing standards booklet from

    back &#40;phone number/address&#41; seems to be incredibly small. <BR> <BR>As
    for colors, there are few paper vendors that produce duplex papers &#40;different
    colors on each side&#41;. Not sure if there is a brown/orange out there, but you
    may want to look into that &#40;should reduce your printing to one color, so it
    may save you a few bucks over a double-impression of orange&#41;. <BR> <BR>The
    logo is great.

  body: Thanks everyone for your input and advice, very much appreciated and i will
    make some changes. Thanks Darrel, it would be pointless for me to continue the
    card as a postcard, the restaurant will have the cards on the tables and i thought
    maybe a few could have stamps already on them, it was an idea. <BR>thanks again.
    <BR>david.

  body: I could be wrong &#40;anyone else have any thoughts on this?...&#41;, but
    I&#39;m not sure that your double hit of yellow will be as intense as shown on
    your comp. The ink is still semi-transparent and will probably darken on that
    chipboard stock. Maybe you should try opaque white with a dry trap of yellow.
    Ask your printer.

  body: if its used as a post card that the restaurant is sending out - whereby they
    are appying the postage....who&#39;s gonna see &#34;breakfast, lunch and dinner,
    weekend brunch&#34; <BR> <BR>even if left on the tables for customers - its a
    bit much to suggest &#40;even graphically&#41; that they pay the postage and send
    back the card...which counteracts the idea of promotion.
