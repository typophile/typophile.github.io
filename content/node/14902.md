  body: "Jordan,\r\n\r\nI think it looks beautiful; it works really well as pixel
    font.  The only letter I have any problem with is uc Q.  It seems like the vertical
    line at the bottom is a little bit too thick.  You would only need to remove one
    pixel from the tail (or whatever that part is called)."

    lines it stands out a wee bit too much, i think.

    that the uc Q seems to be to thick at the bottom. And why is your number 4 not
    a lining figure like the rest of your numbers? "

    about the Q, it doesn't look right. But I can't decide what does.\r\n\r\n<strong>Bart</strong>\r\nI
    like the ornamental G, but I agree that it doesn't work in text. Maybe I should
    have a display+text version...\r\n\r\n<strong>ine</strong>\r\nGood question. The
    answer re:4 is ... I don't know :) I didn't even notice it stuck out that much!
    (Which it clearly does). The upper half of it looks very skinny.\r\n\r\nI've uploaded
    some alternates for the controversial characters, let me know what you guys think."

    body: "First, I must say I really like it!\r\n\r\nNow, the rightmost 4 isn't good,
      it just doesn't look much like a 4. As for the middle one, it'll be much easier
      to tell if you provide of a few strings of different figures with 4 included.\r\n\r\nAs
      for the Q, have you considered making the tail one bit longer? It'll give you
      more flexibility.\r\n\r\nFinally, you might want to consider providing of two
      different G's, a more usual one and the one with the long tail for special occasions.
      Anyway, between the two, I like the left one, with the longer tail, better.\r\n\r\noribendor"

    I'll probably do it through  separate display/text faces).\r\n\r\nGood idea re:
    the Q.\r\n\r\nI agree with you re: the 4, I think the middle version is the best,
    and though this hangs by 1px over the baseline, the glyph doesn't look bottom
    heavy to my eyes.\r\n\r\nJordan"

    -- why the G doesn't harmonise with the Q anyway, I don't know. Not overly sure
    about the J, it may deviate from Bayer's original too much, but it's worth an
    experiment for sure, and all OS numerals -- that may be a bit <i>too</i> un-Bauhaus
    for me (or for Bayopic at least) :)\r\n\r\nlc ascenders: you may be on to something

  body: "i'm no type historian, that's for sure. this pixel font may or may not faithfully
    obide by the original bauhaus alphabet's dimensions/porportions--i wouldn't know.\r\n\r\nbut
    i do feel that pixel fonts almost never work as 'renditions' of more sophisticated
    original typographic works. the reason is, that pixel grids just don't allow for
    the necessary nuance; the fine variation in width, and flexibility in diagonals
    to faithfully get the job done.\r\n\r\nso: i'd like  to see shorter descenders,
    a higher ascender on the 'k', less width on the 'x', perhaps even less width in
    the 's' and 'z', make an entirely new font out of the 'G' and remove it from this
    font, and although you have held a mathematically consistent width for much of
    the uppercase, it looks oddly inconsistent to me.\r\n\r\ni'd try a narrower 'A',
    'C', 'F', 'H', wider 'W', narrower 'Z'\r\n\r\nalso, you might try to make your
    x-height the same as your cap-height right now. make the whole font bigger. that
    way, your more sophisticated 'X' and 'N' and 'Y' might be used for the lowers,
    and bigger, equally sophisticated uppers may accompany them.\r\n\r\nyou'd also
    have greater control over the width of all of your uppercase characters, which
    is something you could use right now, in my opinion. one pixel taken from four
    is a lot more noticeable than one pixel taken from 6."

  body: "Tyler:\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments. FWIW, an example of Bayer's Bauhaus
    letters can be found <a href=\"http://perso.wanadoo.fr/les.besnardtypo/typographies/ecritures/Images/Dbauhaus.gif\">here</a>
    (check out the <code>g</code> and the <code>k</code>) (how the hell do we post
    images inline?).\r\n\r\nAs you can see, my pixel font is not a perfect 'pixelisation'
    of the letterforms, the <code>c</code>, <code>g</code> (to some extent), <code>s</code>,
    <code>x</code> and <code>z</code> exhibit differences that I choose to make bayopic
    more readable. For instance, the narrower <code>x</code> didn't work at all, it
    just got lost in the text, and curving the <code>c</code> in at the stroke ends
    just didn't work either.\r\n\r\nI think re: the caps, it's important to note that
    Baypoic isn't supposed to be a text face. The caps and lowercase don't really
    harmonise because they didn't exist in Bayer's original, initial caps look out
    of place because they're so wide -- to fit in with the style, not the lc. (Though
    I agree with you re: the <code>W</code>, it's definitely too narrow -- it's the
    same width as the lc <code>w</code> for heaven's sake!)\r\n\r\nI think I'll definitely
    create two faces:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Baypoic display:</strong> as seen above,
    with a wider <code>W</code></li>\r\n<li><strong>Bayopic text:</strong> with narrower
    Uc, an extra px on the lc ascenders, and one less on the descenders, a less extreme
    <code>g</code> and a more conventional <code>k</code>.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAnd I love
    your idea of a uniheight version -- essentially, Bayer's alphabet was unicase
    anyway, caps have only been added by designers since. Definitely font-3 in the
    family :)\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nJordan"
