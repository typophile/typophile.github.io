  but without the brush stroke look or the Won-Ton isoceles triangle device. This
  face has spawned others that i am currently working on. I&#39;d appreciate any feedback.

  body: ' bj, <BR> <BR>This and the Motorpsychos are your best designs.  <BR>They
    have a consistency among the glyphs that  <BR>the others lack. I really dig the
    shadow look on  <BR>this, although I&#39;d try it with a 3D block shadow  <BR>&#40;no
    break on the edges&#41; and see what you think. <BR> <BR>While interesting, the
    thin lines on the &#39;O&#39;, &#39;Q&#39;,  <BR>and &#39;E&#39; distract me.
    Maybe alternates? If you  <BR>haven&#39;t guessed, I&#39;m in love with alternates.
    <BR> <BR>Quirky display fonts are your thing, bj. Stick with  <BR>&#39;em. Cool
    stuff. <BR> <BR>Stephen '

  body: 'Stephen -- Text faces are very very difficult, as you probably know. Here
    is a good example of a poor text face &#40;reznor&#41;.  It&#39;s a train wreck,
    full of inconsistencies in style, weight, etc. I don&#39;t know how to do it!<IMG
    SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> I&#39;ve
    studied text faces but I haven&#39;t unlocked the &#39;secret&#39; to actually
    doing one starting from scratch in Illustrator. I am already obsessed with type
    enough that i probably don&#39;t need to obsess over a text face for a year. But
    I love looking at them, especially the work of Storm. <BR> <BR>thanks for the
    advice. I&#39;ll stick to display. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR><!-Attachment: reznor.swf-!><CENTER><TABLE

  body: ' I&#39;m no expert in text faces &#40;or even display faces...&#41;, but
    that &#34;secret&#34; might be that you have to tame your artistic inclinations
    to a huge extent, and worry much more about the &#34;low-level&#34; stuff, stuff
    that only other type designers can put their finger on &#40;and not even most
    of them&#41;. Some people find that boring, but to me personally it&#39;s the
    other way around: Art is great on a wall, but with Craft you can make a meal.
    <BR> <BR>If you show a font to a non-designer &#40;which of course is the target
    audience&#41; and he says &#34;Wow, this is cool&#34;, or &#34;Man, that &#39;e&#39;
    is killer&#34; then it&#39;s not working... The best possible reaction is: &#34;Huh?&#34;

  body: '-- That&#39;s the dichotomy and what separates &#39;fontlovers&#39; from
    &#39;typophiles&#39;. &#40;i refer to the terms themselves, not the sites&#41;
    <BR> <BR>As a person becomes more of a typophile and learns about tradition and
    fundamentals, text faces become more accessible and appreciated. Your numerals,
    for example, to the &#39;fontlover&#39; would be considered boring, but to a typophile,
    they become an exquisite collection of numbers that need precious minutes to be
    fully digested. <BR> <BR>&#40;Your numbers are indeed exquisite, I spent about
    five minutes looking at them, marveling @ how they were constructed. Not easy
    to do. Nice.&#41; <BR> <BR>I design T-shirts for a living so I dirty my hands
    on a daily basis with display faces, but I&#39;m heading toward someday becoming
    a Level 10 Typophile, like you and Stephen. Someday. <BR> <BR>As far as the best
    possible reaction: to have a fontlover say &#39;cool&#39; AND to have a typophile
    say &#39;cool&#39; <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR> <BR>ps: Was the Craft comment an unintenional
    pun? &#40;Kraft for dinner&#41;?'
