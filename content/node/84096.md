body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've released a couple of fonts for the first time, and I'd love
  to hear to your comments. Both fonts can be downloaded for free in my web page.
  Both of them are display fonts, letters with no modulation, thought as a font for
  architectural signs.\r\n\r\nThis one, Museum, is based upon the lettering in the
  Trajan's Column inscription.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.angelsanchez.eu/index.php/project/museum_font\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MuseumFont1_6635.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MuseumFontTrajan_4010.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MuseumFont7_6129.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

  body: "It\u2019s interesting, although I have grown an increasing disease for thoroughly,
    rigidly monolinear treatments. Even if lines are treated 100% uniform in weight,
    I would introduce tidbits of variety by adopting a more unpredictable truncation
    of the traits.\r\n\r\nAlso, although the numerals are nice, considered it\u2019s
    an all-capitals typeface, I would add a set of uppercase-height numerals."

  body: "Piccic, my inttention was making a typeface for buildings lettering. This
    signs are usually produced through folded plates, so the width of the path was
    necessarilly uniform. About numerals, I think it would be nice if people used
    the roman numbers of this font. I finally decided to include this arabic numbers,
    but I wanted to emphasize the ancient style. Anyway, I'm conscious it's not the
    best for capital letters, so I'll consider your suggestion.\r\n\r\nNick, I didn't
    know this Toronto subway typeface. It remembers me Neutraface, and I also have
    some plans of making a 50's modern style typeface.\r\n\r\nThank you, JeorgGustafs."

  body: "Hi Angel. For the numerals, I agree with tying the numerals use with Latin.\r\nBut
    if you include lowercase oldstyle numerals, people will end up using those. So,
    I think it would be better to have the cap-height ones, or none at all. Or you
    may consider keeping also the oldstyle ones, but unreferenced by Opentype, so
    it will be less likely people will (ab)use them. :)\r\n\r\nAbout the monotonal
    weight treatment, it\u2018s fine but I think there are less limitations than we
    think in current technology for buildings' lettering.\r\nI was mostly suggesting
    giving a different inclination in how the strokes terminate, if you don\u2019t
    like the idea of slight modulations.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the [D] is a little
    too wide, and the [R] leg could benefit from being very slightly shortened, so
    it would not extend excessively below the baseline. Overall, it is very nice.\r\nBesides,
    we already have monolinear interpretations of the Latin classical \"Trajan\" model,
    with Mario Feliciano\u2019s Garda, and (especially) Stefano Temporin's Brixia:
    http://www.progetto-italic.org/?p=111 (unreleased)\r\n\r\nMy critique was just
    suggesting things I think could be improvement, but are minor details."

    typeface to date to match Trajan\u2019s proportions (with due subtleties).\r\n\r\nEdit:
