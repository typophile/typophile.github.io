  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have a personal site online, but I have an interview coming up and think it might be nice to have a paper portfolio to present as well.</p>
<p>The interview is casual and I&rsquo;m just looking to intern at a small company for no pay, but any advice?</p>
<p>How many pieces is a good number?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Not only is it &ldquo;nice&rdquo; to have a paper portfolio as well, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything less if you have print work (If you just have websites, that&rsquo;s a slightly different story). You have to show them in the flesh; after all, it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> print. Two classic approaches are to either get/make a nice container and use boards to show off your pieces, or use a book/binder format. I have found boards to be quite successful because you can control exactly what the interviewer is looking at, whereas if you have a book you will have to think about how the separate pieces will interact with each other when you put them on a spread and whether or not one is distracting the interviewer from what you&rsquo;re saying. When it comes down to it, your physical portfolio should be &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; in that it allows your designs to be seen exactly for what they are with no distractions.</p>
<p>And if you have logos, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->don&rsquo;t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> try to save paper and put several on a single page. One logo, at size, on one page.</p>
<p>As far as number of pieces go, the more important principle to follow is to put in only your best work. Convince them that you do <!-- raw HTML omitted -->great<!-- raw HTML omitted --> work, not mediocre work. If you have 3 pieces that are awesome and 10 that just aren&rsquo;t up to par, use the 3. If you have 8 that are phenomenal, good for you, but probably no more. I&rsquo;ve seen too many student portfolios that are filled with junk. Quality, not quantity. As a maximum, I would say no more than 8.</p>
<p>And try to tailor the pieces and your presentation to what the company does. Know who you&rsquo;re talking to, and study up on what work they&rsquo;ve done. You&rsquo;ll be a much more legitimate prospect if you show them you actually give a crap about what they&rsquo;ve done in the past.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
