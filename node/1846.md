body: hi <BR>are there any similar fonts like FF Zapata...   <BR>i know i have seen
  one in the fontfolio from adobe..  but i amn&#39;t sure...  a font in which the
  letter &#34;a&#34; has a tail that sticks upwards <BR> <BR> <BR>like a font called
  Egiziano <BR>unfortunately i do not have an image...  but i can scan one unless
  you already have the foundry for me... <BR> <BR> <BR>{edit} <BR> <BR>i found the
  founder..  Dennis Ortiz-Lopez <BR>he has made a font called OL Egiziano Classic
  <BR>but there should be a similar kind of font.. <BR>huh?! <BR> <BR>

    just plug &#39;slabserif&#39; into MyFonts search <BR>function to see several
    other candidates. <BR><br>'

    on this here in the past. Use the search <BR>and you&#39;ll find them. <BR> <BR>If

  body: Hellenic Wide isn&#39;t available in digital form, but there  <BR>are a couple
    of alternatives. <BR> <BR>If your purpose isn&#39;t too serious, there&#39;s a
    free take on  <BR>Hellenic Wide by Swede Per Ellstrom called <a href="http://hem.passagen.se/spsweet/font2/stereo.html"
    target="_blank"> HiFi Stereo</a>. <BR>Find courtesy of Stephen <BR> <BR>CSA Images
    has a version they call <a href="http://www.csaimages.com/dir_rf_fon.jsp#" target="_blank">
    Platon</a>. <BR> <BR>Mike Yanega pointed us to another version called <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/hefty.htm"
    target="_blank"> Hefty</a>, <BR>which was in an old FontBank collection. The font
    is  <BR>still sold for $2 at BuyFonts.com. <BR> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aboutype/antique-central/"
    target="_blank"> Antique Central</a> is a good alternative if you need a full  <BR>family
    with italics.
