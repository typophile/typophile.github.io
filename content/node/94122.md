body: I'm working on a logo design for school project and wanted to get feedback on
  my kerning. I made O after T smaller to fit the illustration. How do you think kerning
  looks in general? Thank you

  body: The first O looks like it's almost bumping into the R.   I think it could
    use a smidge more space.  Otherwise, it all looks good, including the TO combination.
    I'm not crazy about the color combination, BTW.  I don't know what to call the
    reddish background, but I hope that that shade of red and the yellow aren't the
    school colors :)

  body: I-N is marginally too loose, N-O is too tight, the rest seems OK.
