    I googled the initials.  A certain Mr J.M. Browning, the inventor of the automatic
    rifle.

  body: "I guess I see why you mentioned JMB.  He was a very big fan of all lower
    case as were many of his contemporaries.  A friend of mine, Peter Megert apprenticed
    under him years ago.  Peter wrote everything in lower case.  I find it to be a
    bit of a modernist's affectation in the 21st century.  I opted for no descenders
    to tighten the leading to a painful level. \r\nWhile I can see how the lowercase
    of everything except ONE and ALL can help pose the dichotomy a bit stronger, I
    don't feel it would be any better a solution."

  body: "I think the capital C in Child competes with the capitalization of ONE. In
    terms of visual rhetoric, one could also argue that all lowercase letters appears
    more youthful. I do however see why you may wish to capitalize Child as a proper
    noun. Conversely, with just ONE and ALL in caps, the eye will quickly isolate
    and compare those two words.\r\n\r\nWith just ONE and ALL in capital letters,
    a singular touch of red, and a lowercase c, you may not even need to use bold
    to establish hierarchy.\r\n\r\nA round period may elude to the planet earth? Tough
    call. May conflict with the other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tittle\">tittles</a>
    (linked just in case someone joins in who doesn\u2019t know that word yet), but
    seeing as there are two of them \u2014 ch<strong>i</strong>ld and <strong>i</strong>s
    \u2014 and only one period, in addition to the proximity of the period to the
    word earth the reader will most certainly, consciously or  subconsciously, be
    able to determine that the use of a round period was clearly intended to be a
    rhetorical graphic device, and not just a poorly designed period.\r\n\r\nHave
    you thought about including the name of the typeface on the poster? Possibly instead
    of your own?\r\n\r\nAlignment of small type with the outer stroke of the n in
    than?\r\n\r\nHrm. Design without clients. That\u2019s worth meditating on."

  body: "@Christopher:\r\nMy initial concept of this poster included an exclamation
    point instead of a period with the globe being the dot and the upright being a
    gun site looking straight at you.  All of these little attempts seemed to trivialize
    the message and take away from the dichotomy.  I did, however, make one with only
    the period being round and ocean blue but not oversized.  This looks okay as well
    since it does not detract and is still typographic.\r\nAs far as capital C goes,
    it has nothing to do with proper noun, it is there for emphasis and to tie ONE
    stronger to Child so that it speaks \"ONE CHILD\" more than \"ONE child\" with
    the \"child\" seeming to be of less importance.  If I were concerned with proper
    nouns, I would have capped the word \"Earth\".\r\nTo me, proper punctuation according
    to a style manual is for editors doing more text than this. In a poster, you ave
    very few devices to work with and it is more important to have them speak more
    the intended message than reflect the dictates of Mssrs Strunk&White.\r\nThe small
    byline text is purposely only aligned at bottom.  To align it at right with the
    \"n\" a few lines above would close that space and make the byline too active
    a participant in the structure.\r\n@5Star:\r\nThanks for the complement. The typeface
    is called \"Dez Headsup\".\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/onechildworth2_3706.jpg]"

    stricter gun laws.  I sent it to various political action groups and to my congress
    people here in Virginia.  \r\nI frequently do posters which I write and design--my
    way of avoiding clients ;-).  I have a bunch more on my Flickr site. http://www.flickr.com/photos/dezcom/sets/72157626216163820/\r\n\r\nI
    am only getting one printed for myself which will be part of an art show I am
    having in March.\r\n\r\n\"the gestalt principle of singularity\" sounds better
    than it works. So many academic ventures in defining principles of human communication
    have no basis other than entertaining dialogue.  You sound like a lost Ulm student
    but you are much too young ;-)"
