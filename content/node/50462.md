  file or livetrace something, it won't let me do anything, unless I close and reopen
  that file or click on the layers palette.\r\n\r\nIt lets me zoom in and out, but
  I can't touch anything by clicking on it.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have this problem?\r\n"

    sometimes works..\r\n\r\none option would be to reset Illustrator's prefs\r\nby
    holding down Shift-Command-Option-Control \r\nwhile launching the program...(save
    your workspaces!)"
