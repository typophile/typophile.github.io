    Titling = Felix Titling. <BR> <BR>Forum Titling is a beautiful face &#40;I love
    Goudy&#41; but doesn&#39;t match the sample &#40;see the &#34;O&#34;&#41; - <a
    href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205545">Felix </a> is closer.

    carefully <BR><b>3</b> Do not administrate after midnight <BR> <BR>I was fooled
    because the sample looks <i>a lot</i> heavier than Felix  <BR>Titling, but maybe
    that&#39;s due to the reproduction of the sample. <BR>You&#39;re right about the
    O, and the M didn&#39;t sit well neither.  <BR>My bad.'
