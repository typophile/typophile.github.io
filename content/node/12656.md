  One thing I tried to do was to divide \"Garamonds\" into \"based on Claude Garamond\",
  \"based on Jean Jannon\". On the authority of Bringhurst and Morison I had <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/garamont.html\">
  LTC Garamont</a> as Goudy out of Jannon, and have so classified it. But P22's Lanston
  website (linked above) says it was based on Garamond's types of 1540 ... which would
  make it a Claude. I don't have a decent sample, but my inclination would be to say
  that the Jannon attribution looks right, as well as being historically plausible.\r\n\r\nHave
  I got it wrong? Or have P22/Lanston? I don't want to \"correct\" the Wiki and make
  it worse."

    _Monumental Histoire de l'Imprimerie en France au XV et XVI Siecle_ in which the
    introduction is set in a large letter (about 24-point according to modern measurements)
    which was attributed to Claude Garamond (1540). I made the drawings from this
    type.... I suggested the name \"Garamont\" instead of \"Garamond,\" as that name
    would show at once that it was a Monotype face, not to be confused with the faces
    of othes concerns also following the same source. The name was found by me in
    _Notice sur les Types Etrangers du Specimen de l'Imprimerie Royale_ about the
    type \"attribuait a Garamont.....\"\r\n\r\nBut thanks for bringing this up. I
    have to reprint a book I published in 1986 from repros of the metal Garamont,
    which I no longer have. I didn't realize this face was part of the P22 Lanston
    offerings. My experience with digital Lanston Type is that they are right on the
    money replications of the Lanston Monotype offerings.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: but how long were the Jannon types misattributed? [[Frederick Goudy|Goudy]]
    could have in good faith believed that the letters he based his type on were by
    [[Garamond]] and yet they could have actually been based on Jannon's designs.
    I just cracked <em>Elements</em>, and there is a comparison between the actual
    Garamond style and the Jannon style and Lanston Garamont definately seems to follow
    the Jannon vein.

    died in 1561 (or so). Jannon is a bit later. Original sources, from the horse's
    mouth, so to speak, are often more reliable than that coming from folks known
    to have an \"agenda.\" Other than that, don't know.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: 'Thanks that clears it up. The book Goudy was working from was the one that
    was discovered (in 1926, so after Goudy had done his work) to misattribute the
    font. So it seems clear: Garamont is a Jannon, though Goudy would have thought
    when he made it (and probably afterwards, I don''t get the feeling he was vastly
    concerned about these points) that it was Garamond 1540 ... In fact it is Jannon,
    1620s or so.'
