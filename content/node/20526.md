body: "hello\r\n\r\na friend of mine is looking for the following:\r\na gentle but
  not weak - with a certain strength to it - serif typeface without too much stroke-contrast.
  ligatures are very important (as many as possible), swashes would be good, too.
  it will get used for display, not for text.\r\n\r\nany ideas?\r\nthanks!"

    Eaves </a>has a "smart ligatures package" which automatically places ligatures
    within selected text. Ergo, lots of ligatures!

    that. I'd rather have a spokesperson for a certain foundry anonymously posting
    helpful information under the foundry's name than some Billy Sastard annoying
    the hell out of everyone.\r\n\r\nHear hear, I think it's safe for me to proclaim
    that shameless self-promotion is tolerated and even encouraged on Typophile <em>whenever
    it's appropriate</em>.  In this case everyone was indeed pointing out typefaces
    of their own with lots of ligatures, which was the actual request by the original
    poster. Well done.\r\n\r\nBTW I think both Musee and Odille kick some major booty.
    Especially Odille has had me all giddy with excitement waiting for its release.
    Fabulous job -- eat this all ye black-clad, goatee-stroking DIN and Helvetica
    adepts. :^D\r\n\r\nAnd I still like Mrs Eaves. A lot. It's deliciously awkward
    and very hard to use well, but when you succeed -- oh boy does it pay off. ;^)"
