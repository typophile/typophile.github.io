		<div class="commentbody">I can confirm Victor's comment about the omicron. In a low contrast sans serif type, such as the Helvetica Linotype Greek, I've been able to unify the Latin o and Greek omicron, but in higher contrast book types it is seldom an option unless the Latin is particularly condensed. Even if I am maintaining the ductus of the Latin in the Greek (which I am increasingly loath to do, but that's another topic), I generally find that the omicron needs to be narrower than the o. In a typeface I am working on at the moment, the different is only 10/2048 units, but it is enough to significantly improve the melody of the Greek. Note that I say melody and not rhythm: this too is another topic. <BR> <BR>Of all the scripts I've designed for to date, Greek is consistently the hardest, but it is also my favourite.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have not changed my mind. I have maintained for a long time that the Greek and Latin <i>lowercase</i> letters, because they developed completely independently of each other, under the influence of different cultures and different writing implements, are only artificially unified. The Cyrillic script is a more complex case, because of the importation of a specifically Latin model, and the long relegation of the historical style to religious texts. I'm not in favour of turning back the clock 250 years in the interests of exoticism. In the case of Greek, there is no clock to be turned back, only a very recent and unfortunate fashion in graphic design that favoured Latinised Greek types.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The original Cyrillic script was developed from Greek uncial letterforms. Like the Latin lowercase, the Cyrillic lowercase developed in isolation from the Greek lowercase; the Petrine reform Latinised even the remnant Greek forms, which is why Russian <i>ef</i> and Greek <i>phi</i> are very distinct forms. <BR> <BR>The Greek lowercase is a Byzantine development: it belongs to Constantinople, Alexandria &ndash; it is as much a product of the Middle East as of 'Europe' (and like the other major scripts of the Middle East, the Greek lowercase has a steep ductus and involves rotation as well as translation.) If it can be said to have developed alongside other scripts, those were neither Latin nor Cyrillic: they were Arabic and Hebrew. <BR> <BR>I've designed several Cyrillic typefaces, and have extensively tested all of them, and I have not found <i>any</i> good reason not to unify Latin and Cyrillic cognates (whereas I don't accept that Latin and Greek even have cognates). Nor have any of my more experienced Russian colleagues with whom I have corresponded, and who know a lot more about the needs of living Cyrillic readers than you. Don't think I have not thought about this. What are the cognates? a e o p c y x for upright Russian, plus i j s for Ukrainian and Serbian. The counters of a e o p determine the appropriate width and weight of the other letters in the Cyrillic script, much as they do in the Latin script, and they have done so for 250+ years. In designing Latin type you can easily begin with just o and base the proportions of the other letters on that, and you can do exactly the same thing in Cyrillic. <BR> <BR>Now, the vast majority of Cyrillic typeface designs begin with an existing Latin design, so the influence is entirely one directional. My preferred working method is to design Latin and Cyrillic together; in fact, for design purposes, I might as well consider them a single script. So it is not that my Latin o determines the width of my Cyrillic <i>i</i>, but that my letter o determines the width of my letters n and <i>i</i>. <BR> <BR>One interesting aspect of this approach is that a letter like <i>ze</i> can be developed in isolation from other Cyrillic forms, and checked against the width of the Latin s, even though the latter does not occur in the Russian alphabet. If properly balanced against s, the <i>ze</i> will be found to also be well proportioned relative to other Cyrillic letters. Why? Because all the letters are informing and influencing each other without regard for nominal script divisions. <BR> <BR>Latin and Cyrillic are the only scripts that I approach in this way (excepting the Greek uppercase, which is almost entirely cognate with Latin and Cyrillic). If I'm designing a Latin-Cyrillic-Greek typeface, I always design the Latin and Cyrillic lowercase together; then the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek uppercase together; then the Greek lowercase last, because it is a different writing system and requires a kind of psycho-cultural distance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Glad to hear you're listening. So am I. And I'd like to know the answer to my question. <BR> <BR>As for your explanation of the &quot;design process&quot;, I think I'd need you to elaborate to be sure (and I'd enjoy it to boot), but in toto it seems to me that you place too much value on precedent, on producing fonts the establishment will reward best. I know this is the sort of thing some people (like Maxim) class highest, and certainly such a stance is important to keep the machine well-oiled. But I expect more exploration, even more verbalized doubt, especially from somebody with experience. The more we learn the more we realize there's more to learn. Imagination is more important then knowledge. And all that.  :-) <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">{Our messages crossed.} <BR> <BR>&gt; It's the same friggin' letter! <BR> <BR>To whom? Not for your average reader, not at all! For most people one is a Russian (or Serbian, or Hungarian) letter, the other is English (or French, or Dutch). Their similarity is essentially circumstancial to them. You're talking about evolutionary lineage, but who besides us cares -or should care- about that? When people simply don't know the history, how much does it matter? Type design isn't about teaching history, it's about helping to communicate somebody else's message. <BR> <BR>&gt; The only reason to differentiate them is if you are designing in different styles. <BR> <BR>I cited two reasons to differentiate them above, and I'll add a third: <BR>To increase readability by reducing confusion when the two scripts are intermixed. <BR>Here's my (now-tired) example: <a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/image/s_rome3-1.gif" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/image/s_rome3-1.gif">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/image/s_rome3-1.gif</a></a> <BR>In the part below, Meta's Cyrillic (the &quot;normal&quot; way) is simply too homogenous with the Latin. <BR> <BR>And why wouldn't your logic apply to Greek or Hebrew - because of precedent?

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Imagination is more important then knowledge. </i> <BR> <BR>Ah, we have a fundamental disagreement. That's good to know. <BR> <BR>I don't know what I can usefully add to what I have already written: I design for the Latin and Cyrillic scripts as if they were a single script if both are in the same style. I believe there are sensible, historically-informed reasons to do this and, more importantly, I have found that the results work: it is possible to establish proportions, weights and spacing for both scripts around a shared set of cognates. <BR> <BR>The same sensible, historically-informed reasoning also tells me that some possible cognates between different scripts appropriately take different forms <i>within particular styles.</i> For example, the Ypsilon in Veljovic's Sava is a form that is appropriate to the Greek uncial style, but it is not appropriate to his Latin design, in which it would appear too mannered. I don't know why you're so excited about the Yu in that typeface: the uppercase form of this letter is never the same as either the Latin Y or the Greek Ypsilon, so the fact that Veljovic uses this form is not innovative or groundbreaking: its just the appropriate form of Yu for the Serbian monastic uncial style. If there is something notable about Sava, it is not that it differentiates Cyrillic letters from Latin cognates (it doesn't: A B E M H O C T X are all the same glyphs in both scripts; only P is differentiated, as appropriate to the style, but interestingly Veljovic has unified the Latin K and Cyrillic Ka, so he is actually unifying letters that are normally distinguished, again, as appropriate to the style), but that it belongs to a specifically Serbian tradition.</div>

I look at it and can instantly see where one script ends and another begins. In order to have confusion, you would need to introduce Latin-script words into Cyrillic text that use only cognate forms, but that's what italics are for: to distinguish foreign words in text. <BR> <BR><i>And why wouldn't your logic apply to Greek or Hebrew - because of precedent? Too limiting. </i> <BR> <BR>No, not because of precedence. I really don't care much about precedence, per se, I care about where scripts come from and how the normative forms of the letters were established. So I don't treat Greek (lowercase) and Hebrew in the same way as I treat Latin and Cyrillic because they are different scripts without a shared history. Latin and Cyrillic have a shared history: if they didn't I certainly wouldn't take the approach to them that I do, because it wouldn't be appropriate or authentic. But because of that shared history it is both appropriate and authentic. Yes, that shared history is pretty short in the grand scheme of things, but it is the specific history that has produced the modern scripts that readers use. I've never once said that the readers know or need to know this history: the history is for the designer to understand where the reader is at, where the script is at and, yes, also where the script can go. I've said many times that I'm a jobbing type designer &ndash; I'm not an artist trying to create something 'original', and I'm not a reformer trying to give people something innovative that I think will be good for them &ndash; I make type that people can use and read now, that also fits into the cultural framework that they inhabit. For most Cyrillic readers, that cultural framework is decidedly post-Petrine for everything except religion and nostalgia. <BR> <BR>That's all for now. Some of us have typefaces to design.</div>

So what most people see is a Yu that deviates from the Latin; and if it's less Latin, it essentially becomes more Cyrillic. <BR> <BR>&gt; it belongs to a specifically Serbian tradition. <BR> <BR>But you don't think that would prevent its use by non-Serbs, do you? And that's how culture migrates, in this case hopefully making Cyrillic less Latin, albeit in a small way. <BR> <BR>But yeah, the Ka sucks. <BR> <BR>&gt; I look at it and can instantly see where one script ends and another begins. <BR> <BR>I think if you were immersed you'd stumble. <BR> <BR>As for using italics: <BR>1) That's limiting. It's better if the two scripts were different outright (for text). <BR>2) What if the main text is in italic?  :-/ <BR> <BR>&gt; they are different scripts without a shared history <BR> <BR>None of this history directly affects reading! Some of it certainly does affect reading indirectly, but my point is simply that gently deviating cognates, giving the two scripts slightly different vertical proportions, etc. flies under their conscious sensibilties, but makes for greater functionality. <BR> <BR>BTW, doesn't Daniels (The Expert) say that there really is only one alphabet?
