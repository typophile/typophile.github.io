  worked up the courage to post something for critique. I've been working on this
  one for the last week or so. It's based off some signage on Toronto's King St that
  I am consistently charmed by (the Uniforms Registered building). I've done my best
  to keep the colour fairly consistent while keeping the existing glyphs as close
  as possible to their physical counter-parts.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be greatly
  appreciated as I'm thinking of starting on the lower-case.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\njr"

  body: "The J would fit the style better if it turned up to a flat terminal like
    C and S. Tail of Q could use some weight. Otherwise, everything looks pretty good
    at this distance. A valid critique of weight and curvature would require a vector
    pdf for a closer look.\r\n\r\nIt looks a little to me like you haven't compensated
    for the visual stress of horizontal vs vertical, or for visual center in S etc.,
    but if so, it also seems like this face kind of pulls it off, making it a strong
    choice for sideways and other rotated designs while still looking good upright."

  body: "Generally this is looking pretty good, but there are some global issues and
    a few specific things you probably ought to address before doing the lowercase.\r\n\r\nI'd
    say that you do need to compensate for the horizontal vs vertical. Making them
    physically the same thickness makes the horizontals look heavier than the verticals.
    You need to make the verticals about 5-10% thicker than the horizontals (or the
    horizontals that much thinner) to make them look the same weight. This is just
    how human perception works, so virtually all Latin/Greek/Cyrillic typefaces take
    it into account.\r\n\r\nFiddly stuff: The join of the leg of the R needs some
    slight optical compensation. Same with the intersection on the B. The S looks
    top-heavy.\r\n\r\nAnyway, good luck with it! Doing a typeface is a major project.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions guys, I'll play around some more and see what
    comes out. As for the question of horizontal v. vertical stress, I focused on
    the particularities of the original signage. Here's a google street image: <a>http://bit.ly/d83vv6</a>
    (I would have included my own photos but I'm on a brief vacation in Montreal)\r\n\r\nHow
    do you feel about keeping irregularities in doing revivals/homages? This might
    be a topic for another discussion but when does a typeface's features go from
    eccentric to problematic?\r\n\r\nI hope this doesn't come off as defensive as
    your critiques are exactly what I need to hear and a 100% appreciated. I'll post
    my progress and hope to hear your opinion.\r\n\r\njrl"

  body: "Well, it looks to me like you've already made a distinctly original departure
    from the inspiration, whose top and bottom curves appear to be plain half-circles.
    So I'd suggest you do whatever helps make the most of what you've created.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    these optical adjustments can be very subtle, and it bears asking the rhetorical
    question of what makes you so sure they aren't in the original. They can easily
    be lost in the perspective of a photograph."

  body: "There's no single right answer to the question of keeping irregularities.
    It depends on what you're trying to achieve. How do you want the typeface to be
    used? Often you may have to trade off authenticity against utility/versatility.
    The relationship is usually non-linear. You may want to maximize the sum, or you
    may find one more valuable than the other.\r\n\r\nFor reference, see the page
    here:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/hypatia/hypatia.html\r\n\r\nNote
    the \"flavor vs utility\" graph. Same idea here with authenticity vs utility/versatility,
    IMO. But depending on what you're after, you may value one more than the other,
    in which case the ideal balance would be different (but still quite likely not
    right at either extreme, IMO).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I've attached a sample pdf of the adjustments I've made so far in my original
    post. I've evened out the horizontal stress to make the stroke weight look more
    uniform. The N and M feel a bit darker than the rest of the letters but that might
    just be me. As I said before I'm debating whether or not to do a lower case. I'll
    work on a few glyphs and post what I come up with.\r\n\r\n@cerulean & Thomas Phinney:
    You both paid me a compliment in your first posts and I focused on being defensive
    in my reply, which isn't very fair. I've of course kept a copy of the original
    wonky glyphs because I like them but thanks to your advice I've ended up with
    something I can seem myself using much more.\r\n\r\nThanks again and I hope to
    hear what you think,\r\njrl\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Looking really good. Get ready for more picking.\r\n\r\nThe diagonal of N
    is severely heavy. The diagonal of Z is tapering from one width to another. The
    vertical of P is thin, probably an accident.\r\n\r\nNow the tough stuff. The upper
    right corner of B,P,R is lumpy (i.e. its curves aren't matching up). The inside
    curve is formed well, while the outside curve starts sloping down too early and
    then bulges out.\r\n\r\nThe S appears to be leaning to the right; I suggest nudging
    the top half to the left a tiny bit so it sits centered, and then working on the
    middle curves more.\r\n\r\nI think it's a good idea that you're holding onto the
    version with apparent reversed stress. It seems like the sort of face that people
    might <em>like</em> to use for setting sideways, and having a separate version
    optimized for that would be a neat selling point."
