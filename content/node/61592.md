  in smaller quantities. It's a food with a twist which means it contains interesting
  mix of ingredients in otherwise ordinary products.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for suggestions
  for typeface that would communicate HOME-MADE, WARM, and in the same time EXCLUSIVE
  (high quality) . \r\nI already have a solution for expressing \"food with a twist\"
  part so the type doesn't have to express that. Maybe a slight touch of \"a twist\"
  in type would be OK. I am particulary interested to see SERIF typeface suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm
  only looking for a professional typeface since we're talking about high quality
  product."

    font combined with a swashy script font to add the touch of homemade personality. '

  body: Hmmm...thanks for the suggestions.However, I want to keep the type simple
    with just a touch of "difference". Also these fonts like Clarendon and Avance
    seem to be a little too rough in this case. I imagine the needed type would be
    a bit more softer (a bit rounder or finer letters than in suggested types). It's
    a small food production company so I want it more warm.
