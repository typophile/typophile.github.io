  to make the mecca to The Hamilton Wood Type Museum in Two Rivers.\r\n\r\nWe arrived
  on a rainy (and slightly busy) Wednesday and ended up having a great conversation
  with Jim Moran, the Director and sole employee who dedicates 7 days a week to keeping
  the place open. \r\n\r\nI wish I could say there were other reasons to visit Two
  Rivers, but there isn't a whole lot going on there, but if you are ever in the region,
  do try to make it over and say 'hi' to Jim and check out the space and ephemera.
  It looks like Jim has lots of great ideas to grow exposure to the place. \r\n\r\nHere
  are some photos (alas, I have a crappy camera and was never a great photographer
  to begin with, but if you thumbnail them all, they don't look too bad...)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hamilton_3634.jpg]"

    had some pretty damn good cheese curds.\r\n\r\nHeading north from there, the Flying
    Pig was an interesting coffee shop/art gallery in the middle of nowhere (http://www.theflyingpig.biz/)\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'll vouch for Phil Rohrer's, and for his "famous raw fries" as well. I would
    also recommend the relatively-nearby Kohler Art Center in Sheboygan.
