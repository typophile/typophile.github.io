body: "P22 Cezanne was initially designed by [[Michael Want]] in 1996 while he was
  at [[P22]] type foundry. Cezanne is based on the hand written correspondences of
  French Impressionist painter <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_C%C3%A9zanne\">Paul
  C\xE9zanne</a>.\r\n\r\nP22 Cezanne was originally created for the Philadelphia Museum
  of Art. Upon it\u2019s release it quickly became one of the most popular fonts of
  the1990\u2019s, and has remained very popular to this day.\r\n\r\nCezanne Pro was
  designed by [[James Grieshaber]] in 2005 to expand on the original Cezanne font.
  Cezanne Pro was realized as an OpenType font to includes full Western and Central
  European character sets and Cyrillic for typesetting in dozens of languages. It
  features several types of numerals, ligatures, snap-on swashes, and word glyphs.
  Cezanne Pro includes over 1,200 glyphs and \u201Csmart features\u201D that will
  automatically substitute letter combination\u2019s to create an even more natural
  handwriting effect than was possible with the original Cezanne font."
