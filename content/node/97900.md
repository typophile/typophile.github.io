  feel inspired and appreciate typography, My audience is 4-16 year olds. My aim is
  to try and inspire 4-16 year olds to appreciate typography and possibly enjoy it
  more. I've done some secondary research into my age range and have even tried to
  make typography attractive via means of colour and shape but i'm not really getting
  much feedback when i approach people who stop and look. I was wondering if anybody
  may have some helpful suggestions or advice?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/__6114.jpg]"

      my post didn't quite distinguish my age range up into categories. You're quite
      right! 16 year olds aren't \"kids\" they're teenagers.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "The basic question is: what are the \u201Crules of engagement\u201D? The
    children at the younger extremes of the spectrum are still learning about how
    the world works, and how they fit into it. Teens, on the other hand, are trying
    to find their place in the social hierarchy. So, at one end, the principle at
    work is Wonder; at the other end, Conformity. Of course, what is cool to teenagers
    is constantly changing\u2014which makes parents perpetually clueless, and product
    and/or service peddlers rich.\r\n\r\nSo, that which engages the younger minds
    may remain constant, while the older minds will seek Novelty. IMHO, this typeface
    works either way\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/kandinsky-nf/\r\n\r\nAlthough,

  body: "Your audience is so far apart in the learning curve of language, writing,
    recognizing letters that you'll have to set up multiple ways to engage them. So
    I wouldn't bombard the younger audience with too many ways of writing/lettering.
    \r\n\r\nFor the younger ones I think it's more interesting to let them do things
    with their hands. For instance: take a box of sand and draw letters in it, this
    also immediately teaches the reason of negative space since your letters will
    otherwise collapse ;) \r\n\r\nBut for your older audience I think letting them
    discover letterforms in their surroundings could be a good way to engage and teach
    them. Having them understand why they see a letter, understanding what the main
    ingredients are of a letterform. Also, this is something they can take along after
    your project is long done.\r\n\r\nSadly my own intervention into kid type/typography
    still will take a while to finish, otherwise I'd hook you up.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ZHDLD_5612.gif]\r\n\r\nInterested
    in what you'll come up with!"
