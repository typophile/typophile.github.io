body: "Is it appropriate to use punctuation in the vicinity of smiley faces?\r\nFor
  example :), does the comma look like a chin here?\r\nI'm really confused :(...\r\n\r\nSometimes
  I feel that surrounding punctuation undermines the legibility of those symbols  but
  on the other hand they should ideally be treated as full words."

  body: "Great question :)\r\n\r\nI guess no one ever get to question this, cos smileys
    aren't really used in what you might call formal texts, so book typographers are
    probably never confronted with this question. And I wonder how many people design
    their emails and blog posts (If you'll find them anywhere, it's probably here...)
    Anyway, as smileys are made of punctuation, it's unavoidable that there are some
    conflicts there. I just try to integrate them somehow (like this :)  ) Just try
    to have fun with it and make up your own rules, cos there is no rulebook yet (though
    there might be one someday, image that: A corporate identity manual regarding
    the use of smileys in documents) LOL \r\n\r\n=:~P\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"
