body: "Hi,\r\n\r\njust signed-up on typophile and would like some advice from all
  you good people. I've had a go at designing my own creative identity (I'm more of
  a developer but having spent a lot of time actionscripting in flash I'm feeling
  the need to become more informed typographically speaking and with graphic design
  principles too).\r\n\r\nHaving moved to Brittany, France, recently I needed a relevant
  and local ID - et voila! as they say on the rive gauche - \"zansal\" - pronounced
  je-on-sal is the Breton word for dansing and (possibly) singing. The dancer is attempting
  to make a Z sign - this was inspired by a book I read 4 years ago \"ABZ more alphabets
  and other signs\" (great book) - the typeface is Bodoni with Helvetica Nueu for
  the tagline.\r\n\r\nHere's the link: [[http://www.zansal.com|zansal]] \r\n\r\nNow,
  I like Bodoni - I really do - but I'm aware of other similar fonts such as Didot
  or JF Porchez's Ambroise. Should I stick with Bodoni? With the extra wide setting
  it looks good on the web even at small point size.\r\n\r\nThe tagline might be better
  in serif? Ideas anyone? I'd appreciate all comments.\r\n\r\n "

    why are you using a Bodoni in France instead of a Didot? "

    top of the L and the N is more rounded in bodoni than the angular version in didot."
