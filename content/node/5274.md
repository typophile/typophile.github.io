body: I&#39;m designing a postcard for a benefit play for a sexual assault support
  center and I&#39;m looking for some typographical advice. <BR> <BR>The postcard
  has a large watercolor flower &#40;a lily, I think&#41; and is going to have either
  a black or PMS 689 &#40;kinda purple&#41; background. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for
  a font that&#39;s &#40;obviously&#41; strong and feminine at the same time.  The
  text is going to be knocked out of the background, so it can&#39;t be ultra-thin.
  <BR> <BR>I was thinking that Curlz is really nice. <BR> <BR>Just kidding. <BR> <BR>Centaur
  Swash looks pretty good, but I&#39;m not really excited about the serif coming off
  the top of the &#34;P&#34;, and Jennifer isn&#39;t bad, but it might be a little
  too curly and Jennifer Light is too light. Lorrenne? Help?

  body: The client ended up choosing Centaur, though I did like the Novarese. <BR>Just
    thought you might like to know where it went. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your input,
    guys. <BR> <BR>Girls, where were you on this one?
