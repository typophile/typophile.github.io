  body: Hi <BR> <BR>The specimen you show for the Plantin Regular does not at all
    correspond to the original metal Plantin 110. I&#39;m looking at one of the Monotype
    Corp Ltd spec books. In fact, in the lining &#34;alternate&#34; numerals, the
    Plantin has ball terminals!!! <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t know if the digital wizards would
    have switched in the Italian Old Style figures, or something similar. Good catch
    on your part though. <BR>Sort of a shame they would have screwed around with this.
    <BR> <BR>Goudy was a bit long gone before digital so I doubt he had anything to
    do with this.  <BR> <BR>Gerald
