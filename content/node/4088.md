  <BR> <BR>1&#41; Is there a family that has sloped romans and italics? &#40;serif
  or sans&#41; <BR> <BR>2&#41; If there are any &#40;or if any were made&#41; would
  you use sloped romans for accents and italics for emphatic speech? Or would you
  avoid the sloped roman, as Bringhurst suggests? <BR> <BR>Just some random thoughts...

  body: 'From <i>Stanley Morison: his typographic achievement</i>, by James Moran:
    <BR> <BR>&#34;However, Morison&#39;s liking for the Arrighi-style italic was not
    followed when Van Krimpen designed Romulus, cut by Monotype in 1936. Its italic
    applied Morison&#39;s theoretical ideas in his essay <i>Towards an Ideal Italic</i>
    where he had urged that the only function of the italic was to support the main
    roman letter. Romulus was therefore a sloped roman, but the result was not a happy
    one for the reader, as A. F. Johnson observed in a review in <i>Signature</i>
    &#40;No. 13, 1940&#41; where he stated of the &#39;sloped roman&#39;: &#39;This
    may be logical, but results in a stiff and monotonous letter.&#39; Both Morison
    and Van Krimpen later considered the experiment to be wrong in principle, but
    they discussed a script type for the Romulus family, and out of this came Van
    Krimpen&#39;s exquisite Cancelleresca Bastarda.&#34; &#40;p. 142&#41; <BR> <BR>As
    to more modern use of the sloped roman, Knuth &#40;1986&#41; -- although he did
    not specifically design a sloped roman -- advocates use of a mathematically sloped
    roman in the context of mathematical text: &#34;Slanted roman type was introduced
    in the 1930s, but it first became widely used as an alternative to the conventional
    italic during the late 1970s. It can be beneficial in mathematical texts, since
    slanted letters are distinguishable from the italic letters in math formulas.
    The double use of italic type for two different purposes -- for example, when
    statements of theorems are italicized as well as the names of variables in those
    theorems -- has led to some confusion, which can now be avoided with slanted type.&#34;
    &#40;p. 13&#41; <BR> <BR>Personally, I have an aversion to slanted roman type;
    this is no slight against Romulus. Rather, it stems simply from seeing so many
    bad examples of artifically sloped roman type in advertising and text. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: 'Chris, this is something I&#39;ve researched a good deal. <BR> <BR>Some fonts
    have had an italic that was replaced with another. Think Bembo. Some fonts have
    had a sloped-Roman which was later replaced by so-called &#34;true italics&#34;.
    Probably the best example is Electra. Morison influenced the creation of Electra&#39;s
    first italic. His ideology was solid &#40;for a change&#41;, but he went in the
    wrong direction, taking the idea too literally. Other fonts have had two italics,
    one more italic than the other. Porbably the best example is Seria &#40;although
    its first italic is unusable for emphasis&#41;. There&#39;s also a font which
    didn&#39;t have any italic at first, so people auto-sloped it. When the designer
    released a true italic, many users clamored for the old one! So the designer released
    the sloped-Roman as  a true separate alternative. That font is Treacy&#39;s Arrow.
    <BR> <BR>Then there&#39;s Sauna, which has two italics with different levels of
    cusiveness &#40;but the same slope&#41;. <BR>This is the closest thing to the
    &#34;ideal&#34; that I&#39;ve found, except: <BR>1&#41; It&#39;s not a text face.
    <BR>2&#41; You really want less cursiveness overall, especially in the less cursive
    one. <BR> <BR>My Patria has an italic that&#39;s not really a sloped-roman but
    it&#39;s very rigid. There&#39;s also a second italics &#40;at the moment with
    incompatible proportions however - a long story&#41; which is basically a sloped-Roman
    with semi-serifs. It&#39;s called Harrier, and I actually see it as a next-generation
    book face. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; &#34;Slanted roman type was introduced in the 1930s
    <BR> <BR>More like the 1830s... Well, in the second half of the 19th century.
    <BR>Most notably by Tuleu, Deberny&#39;s bastard son. <BR> <BR>The true age of
    sloped-Romans is a little-know fact, which Morison deftly covered up. In the end,
    his single good idea was unoriginal. It&#39;s a good thing he wrote a lot of books.

  body: '&#62; Morison wanted italic types that are not too different from their <BR>&#62;
    roman counterparts, that perhaps share similar widths and proportions. <BR> <BR>From
    the famous Fleuron article -where you can see for example Morison taking a Roman,
    slanting it, then modifying it slightly- it seems that he was advocating an italic
    structurally similar to the Roman, yes, and even highly so. His problem with the
    conventional italic is that its informal structures introduce an unnecessary skewing
    of the Roman&#39;s &#34;voice&#34;. And he was right. For a reader the only real
    marker of an italic is its slope &#40;which is why upright italics are just a
    bad joke&#41;. As a result, a sloped-Roman is in fact the ideal. This doesn&#39;t
    mean however that all the serifs have to be maintained, or the &#34;a&#34; has
    to remain binocular, etc. First of all, it has to look nice. But the point is
    that it doesn&#39;t have to be cursive to look nice. If you look at the  Deberny
    sample I linked to, you&#39;ll see a truly intelligent as well as attractive rendering
    of a slanted-Roman &#40;unlike the stuff Morrison&#39;s contemporaries produced&#41;.

    relationship with the Roman. But is it a sloped or a &#34;true&#34;? In fact I

    lowercase a as the key letter in determining whether an italic is a sloped roman.
    Foot serifs and general rigidity, even a non-descending f, these are all found
    in historical sloped lettering styles that are clearly not sloped romans per se,
    and which certainly predate the typographic concept of a sloped roman. I think
    we&#39;re making a mistake if we divide all sloped lettering into either &#39;sloped
    roman&#39; or &#39;true italic&#39;: there is a variety of sloped lettering, which
    deserves to be more thoughtfully considered. Joanna italic certainly isn&#39;t
    cursive, but it is very far from being a sloped version of the roman: the compression
    of the letters is extreme, and quite contrary to Morison&#39;s idea of a sloped
    roman as a subservient style.'

    35 &amp; 36 [The Typophiles: New York, 1960.] <BR> <BR>The trim size is 4.5 x
    7&#34;. The text is set in Electra, 10 / 12 x 19p6, 32 lines deep. Ruzicka specified
    the use of both the original italic and the cursive for different kinds of distinctions.
    Within text, the cursive is used for emphasis, foreign phrases, and titles of
    works; but captions and extended extracts from writings or interviews are set
    in the sloped roman. The effect is subtle and quite interesting. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t

  body: My Master&#39;s thesis actually had a lot to do with the structural differences

    that structural change in the letterforms is the critical feature in determining
    when you&#39;ve got an italic instead of a sloped roman. If you want one big change
    to point at, I agree with John that a change from a double story to single story
    &#34;a&#34; is probably the clearest indicator. <BR> <BR>I can see a usage for
    a less distinctive italic when it is going to be set fairly separately from the
    upright. But when it is being used mixed in with roman text, contrast is exactly
    what it necessary to help it stand out enough. It&#39;s just a question of what&#39;s
    enough contrast; I think it&#39;s pretty clear that I&#39;m in the mainstream
    as believing that a cursive element is helpful in creating the necessary amount
    of contrast. My impression is that the kind of &#34;ideal italic&#34; Hrant would
    favor, I would find useless in any situation where it had to mix with roman. <BR>

    degree they <i>actually</i> need&#41;, but the real point here I think is the
    <i>types</i> of contrast that can be used, and which are suitable in what ways.
    <BR> <BR>Italics can stand out in various ways, such as slant, cursiveness, color,
    apparent size, narrowness, etc. and certainly most italics combine more than one
    of these&#42;. What we need to try to figure out is: <BR>1&#41; How much each
    factor contributes to the contrast, and in what contexts &#40;most significantly
    in terms of display versus text work&#41;. <BR>2&#41; What other &#34;baggage&#34;
    does each factor bring, and how is each type of baggage good/bad with respect
    to the italic&#39;s primary role &#40;emphasis in a body of the Roman&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; Patria&#39;s for example uses ALL the ones I list, mostly because I
    decided to make its slant very slight &#40;1/16 = ~3.58 degrees&#41;, and it needed
    help pulling away from the Roman. <BR> <BR>A telling indication that cursiveness
    is insufficient on its own is the simple truth that an &#34;upright italic&#34;
    &#40;which I prefer to call &#34;cursive roman&#34;&#41; just doesn&#39;t work
    for emphasis. <BR> <BR>My feeling is that cursiveness: <BR>1&#41; Does indeed
    add to contract, but not much. <BR>2&#41; Is not <i>indispensable</i> for good
    functionality. <BR>3&#41; Can help or hinder depending on the nature of the Roman
    &#40;and its proper use&#41;. For example, cursiveness is less welcome in a news
    face than it is in a coffee-table book about Italian art. Cursiveness brings an
    informality to the setting that might or might not be a good idea; in fact I think
    it&#39;s really a lousy default choice of contrast tactic. Part of the reason
    is that I think chirographic Romans are themselves flawed. <BR> <BR>Most of all,
    I think what needs to be admitted is that <i>slant</i> is in fact the primary
    axis of differentiation, especially in immersive reading, where structural pedantisms
    such a deeper angle in the arches of h/n/m/u are secondary &#40;even tertiary,
    when you consider that color for example is more significant&#41;. This is common
    sense, actually, and the main people resisting this obvious fact are chirographic
    type designers, who want cursiveness to have a power it simply can&#39;t. When
    they ridicule the sloped-Roman, it&#39;s not because they have any proof that
    it&#39;s less functional &#40;the proof would show the opposite!&#41;, it&#39;s
    because it counters their &#34;faith&#34;. Others favor cursiveness simply because
    &#34;them&#39;s the way me pappy always made &#39;em&#34;. <BR> <BR>What we need

  body: My Master&#39;s thesis topic was actually extreme form change in multiple
    master fonts. But to embody that problem, I did an MM that morphed from a Venetian
    roman to a very cursive italic. So I also studied the difference in the forms
    a lot, and in some different ways than most people have needed to look at them.
    I learned lots about the problems &#40;and solutions&#41; of linear interpolation
    along the way. <BR> <BR>You did a good job of enumerating the typical differences
    between roman and italic. Although I agree that the slope is perhaps the single
    largest factor in visually distinguishing the typical italic from the roman, I
    don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to make a simple formula for the relative contributions
    of each of the differentiating factors. Indeed, I think that if one was expressing
    it mathematically, that some of those differences are perhaps multiplicative with
    each other, or some other more complex relationship. <BR> <BR>Personally, I think
    there&#39;s nothing wrong with some cursiveness in an italic. Too much will interfere
    significantly with readability, but of course if italic is reserved for emphasis,
    a &#42;little&#42; slowing down is not necessarily bad. <BR> <BR>The part of this
    where we disagree most strongly is where you bring in all the anti-chirographic
    screed. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m particularly strongly in the chirographic-is-inherently-good
    camp. But I do think that there is some significant truth to the idea that people
    are the most comfortable reading fonts that have familiar structure and rhythm.
    For the Latin script &#40;and many others&#41; that familiar structure and rhythm
    has a lot to do with the chirographic underpinnings of our printed language. <BR>
    <BR>In a country with sufficiently strong centralized control, it would be possible
    to change this by decree and just do fonts with no chirographic basis. It would
    just take 50 years or so. Unlike you, I don&#39;t think this would necessarily

    seeing the two story a turn reasonably smoothly into a one-story a, and the roman

  body: 'As promised, here are a few tidbits I dug up. <BR> <BR>Excerpts from two
    letters from Dwiggins to Griffith, which confirm that he was influenced by Morison&#39;s
    article: <BR><blockquote>March 22, 1932. <BR>&#34;I send with this . . . trials
    for my italic. You will remember when we were talking about it once we said let&#39;s
    try something not like the usual italic form. This shot is not like the usual
    italic. It might be called slanted roman. Stanley Morison was advocating something
    along this line, as better for words in an otherwise roman set-up that wouldn&#39;t
    jump out of the page so much as the usual italic.  <BR>&#34;This attempt, as you
    will see, has roman style serifs, etc., -- idea is to have it color just like
    its accompanying roman -- same weights and finishing features. &#34; <BR> <BR>June
    14, 1932. <BR>&#34;My gag has been -- working along the lines suggested by Stanley
    Morison -- to make an italic that would be weighted the same as the roman; keeping
    the texture of the page, and still breaking away from the roman far enough to
    do the trick that italic is used for. This [Electra Italic] will unquestionably
    keep the texture pretty, the test will be to see if it separates enough to do
    the trick.&#34;</blockquote> <BR>&#40;It should be noted that the drawings for
    this italic would have been made by hand -- that is, I don&#39;t believe that
    Dwiggins made use of any photographic manipulation to arrive at his sloped roman.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Griffith, in one of his commentaries, provides this evaluation of the
    circumstances surrounding the birth of the second italic: <BR><blockquote>&#34;The
    oblique roman letter, misnamed italic, designed as a running mate with Electra
    Roman, failed to perform the service that an italic is used for: contrast, emphasis.
    It was successful, however, in keeping the texture of the page, but so much so
    that it did not break away far enough to provide a sufficient degree of contrast.
    Used apart from the roman as an individual face in its own right, this so-called
    italic possesses essential virtues that make it uniquely appropriate and felicitous
    for poetry, separatist texts, etc., for its allusive clearness and dignity. .
    . . <BR>&#34;With the growth in popularity of Electra as a book text face, the
    demand became insistent for a more conventional form of italic, particularly the
    lowercase characters, to provide the necessary break in texture of the printed
    page. Accordingly, WAD set out to develop a lowercase alphabet in the cursive
    form which would meet the requirements and at the same time look well in conjunction
    with oblique style of capitals, numerals, etc., previously made for the original
    italic.&#34;</blockquote> <BR>Dwiggins&#39;s first attempts in this direction
    were actually quite bizarre, with some distractingly exotic forms for &#39;g r
    s&#39; and an idea for some rather swashy capitals. He also faced some challenges
    working within the constraints of Lino duplexing. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

  body: Personally, I find that overly steep slants on italics are jarring and distracting.
    But maybe that&#39;s just me. But I have to admit that for contrast only, there
    is certainly some amount of slant that is sufficient. <BR> <BR>Actually, that
    brings to mind an observation. System-slanted &#34;faux italics&#34; are usually
    at 20 degrees I think, while 10 to 12 degrees is typical of real italics. Perhaps
    the OS designers thought they needed that much slant in the absence of the other
    changes in form. <BR> <BR>As for expectations, I wasn&#39;t thinking of them necessarily
    being conscious expectations, no. <BR> <BR>As for differences in weight, if you
    look carefully or do some measurements, you&#39;ll find that the overwhelming
    majority of italics are slightly lighter in weight than their roman counterparts.
    Now, they&#39;re also slightly narrower, but in general the reduction in weight
    goes just a tad beyond the amount necessary to maintain the same color. FWIW,
    I&#39;m pretty sure Robert Slimbach agrees with me on this, unless I&#39;m completely
    misremembering a conversation we had a few weeks ago. <BR> <BR>But we&#39;re talking
    a pretty subtle difference in weight, nowhere near the amount one has between
    one weight and the next in a series. In most typefaces, italics are definitely
    a more subtle form of emphasis than boldface. Of course there are exceptions--Galliard

    gets on my tit: if you ask people what italics are used for, one of the typical
    answers is &#39;for emphasis&#39; &#40;indeed, the &#39;em&#39; tag in HTML is
    interpreted almost exclusively as applying italics: you have to make a different
    choice explicit in your CSS if you want something other, e.g. bold&#41;. But this
    is often followed by the observation that &#39;bold is actually better for emphasis&#39;.
    The problem of both the response regarding the use of italic and the observation
    regarding bold is that it makes no distinction between <b>visual</b> emphasis
    and <i>linguistic</i> or <i>articulatory</i> emphasis. The main use of italics
    within text is for articulatory emphasis, the typographic equivalent of verbal
    stress. This is completely different from visual emphasis, which unless used to
    denote shouting has no verbal equivalent: it is usually navigational or indicative
    of information hierarchy, e.g. to highlight a warning or some other particularly
    important message in a text. So when you talk about using italic or bold for emphasis,
    be clear about what <i>kind</i> of emphasis you mean.'

    the unilateral serif placement than from the slant; silly as it may sound, the
    letters seem to be taking a step in the right direction &#40;no pun intended,
    really&#41;, which is important in a language that is meant to be read from left-to-right.

    there&#39;s something a bit off about using italics for emphasis, and a good typographer

    when was the last time you typeset an author&#39;s text? <BR> <BR>Practically
    never. My claim comes from observation. In 99% of the typesetting on this earth
    &#40;and Kent, you can certainly consider yourself in the other 1%&#41;, there&#39;s
    the roman, and then there&#39;s its italic, and the latter is used for any kind
    of differentiation, including article names, single words, etc. Yes, they&#39;re
    coming from different places &#40;and if that&#39;s what John meant then, sure,
    I agree&#41;, but as far as the reading process is concerned the &#34;micro&#34;
    functionality is the same. Now if you&#39;re asking for some sort of formalization
    for &#34;the masses&#34; to use <i>two</i> forms of differentiation instead of
    just italics, then you&#39;re asking for even more than me! I&#39;m simply asking
    for people to use a Demi &#40;for everything&#41;, instead of italics. And onsceen
    typography is actually heading this way; if ideology won&#39;t facilitate the
    shift from slant to color, maybe technological limitation will!  :-/ <BR> <BR>Hey,
    that strange WAD italic is interesting! Mostly I&#39;m glad to see it&#39;s not
    an idea about a funky italics that I&#39;ve had myself... <BR> <BR>&#40;William:

  body: 'Wow, I was away from Typophile all weekend, and now my mind is reeling from
    the wealth of discussion here. This&#39;ll probably be a long post. <BR> <BR>Firstly,
    I find it appropriate that Electra comes up in this topic, since I&#39;ve been
    a fan of it ever since I discovered it back in school. In fact, it was a large
    subliminal &#40;and later a direct&#41; inspiration for my first attempt at typeface
    design. I&#39;ve always been drawn to lighter faces &#40;a child of the digital
    age, I suppose&#41;, but now I&#39;m starting to find many of them too thin and
    spindly. In fact, the roman I designed is probably more of an anemic, poorly-fed
    light face rather than a roman. So, Kent, if you revive Electra, I will be forever
    in your debt. <BR> <BR>Secondly, I&#39;m fascinated by the possibilities of these
    two variations, to the point that I&#39;d want to incorporate both into any serif
    design I&#39;d end up doing &#40;I still hold out hope that I&#39;ll get to it&#41;.
    Although, I abhor the mathematical &#39;faux&#39; italics of word processing,
    so it would be interesting to see where my tastes would lead me. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>
    <BR>In reference to the emphasis discussion &#40;bold v. italic/ high contrast
    v. low contrast&#41;, I avoid bold weights in text scrupulously, unless forced
    by &#39;marketing concerns&#39;. When I post on the web, I&#39;m emulating my
    speech &#40;which is often sarcastic or ironic&#41;, so I use italics for subtle
    emphasis, and bold for more blunt emphasis. But in printed text, I think I&#39;d
    use capitals before I&#39;d use bold, solely because of the color difference in
    the words. I&#39;m not sure where or when I came to this conclusion, but there
    it is. I reserve bold for heads, typically. I guess this strikes at editorial/
    authorial decisions as well. Why use caps for yelling, one could just preface
    with, &#34;He yelled...&#34;? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Anyway, concerning the sloped
    v. italic: I would never give up what I consider the rhythmic beauty of a well-matched
    calligraphic italic in a field of serenely vertical romans. It may not be the
    most efficient or theoretically sound choice, but I don&#39;t think that makes
    it less effective.&#42; However, the idea of supplementing a family&#39;s range
    of voice with a sloped roman does seem like an intriguing idea &#40;Though I&#39;m
    treading ground that&#39;s already been covered here, I suppose.&#41; <BR> <BR>Perhaps
    I hold this view for the same reason I wear my great-uncle&#39;s manual-winding
    wristwatch: it&#39;s a connection to the past &#40;as Thomas points out&#41; that
    just feels right... and still works. <BR> <BR>&#42;Interesting side anecdote:
    I once had to defend the somewhat out-of-context serif italic affectations of
    Gill Sans italic to a client, who thought they were &#39;wierd&#39;. I believe
    they were implying I should faux-italicize instead. Oh, they know not what they
    do... Fortunately, I cut that debate short before it got out of hand.'

    italic disrupts the roman &#34;voice&#34;; but I would suggest that this is precisely

    nontypographic people, when asked, would say that italic is like a change in voice,
    while bold &#40;or demibold&#41; is like a change in volume. &#40;I don&#39;t

    purpose of an emphasis style is simply to differentiate, visually. The context

  body: '<i>The purpose of an emphasis style is simply to differentiate, visually.</i>
    <BR> <BR>Yes, but differentiating visually does not necessarily involve <b>visually
    emphasising</b> which is what happens when you change weight. Such visual emphasis
    draws immediate attention to the bold words, overriding normal reading, which
    is the intent: visual emphasis says &#39;look here&#39;. Articulatory emphasis,
    using italics, makes a visual distinction, but it is not a distinction of visual
    emphasis. Italics do not say &#39;look here&#39;, and they do not override normal
    reading; rather, as you are reading they subtly signal that a word is of a different
    order to the words around it, either because it is a foreign word or because it
    is <i>stressed</i>. <BR> <BR>I disagree that typical italics introduce a &#39;perceptive
    informality&#39;. I see nothing informal in the typical italic, e.g. Bembo. If
    anything, such italics are much more formal &#40;literally, <i>formata</i>&#41;than
    sloped romans, which tend to look like toy versions of their upright versions.
    <BR> <BR>A &#39;carefully balanced demi&#39; is still darker than the surrounding
    text. It is still going to draw the eye to it: even before one starts reading
    at the top of the page, one is going to be aware of this dark area in the lower
    peripheral vision. It is still going to say &#39;look here&#39;'

    <BR>Not if it&#39;s not too dark. An overly-italic italic has the exact same problem
    that a too-dark bold has. An emphasized word needs to draw a saccade from the
    correct range: the fixation before it, but not before that. The correct amount
    of contrast does this, and this is at the perceptive level, way before the reading
    mechanism has had time to figure out any higher-level information such as what
    the emphasis is about. <BR> <BR>&#62; I see nothing informal in the typical italic
    <BR> <BR>Really? That&#39;s strange. So Noordzij is wrong there [too]? <BR> <BR>&#62;

    the sloped romans compared to the italics. But the italics click more for me when
    considering their common usage as an indication of importance, extra considerations,
    emphasis, emotion, tone, etc. &#40;excluding titles, which is partially what sparked
    the questions in the first place <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    more for me <BR> <BR>No doubt, and nobody should condemn you for your feelings.

    Lo-fi printing is less demanding in terms of readability anyway. So for example

    <BR> <BR>Are you saying that silent reading is effectively monotonous? I do not
    think that silent reading is <i>totally</i> removed from verbal articulation,
    especially not when one is reading a novel and is dealing with dialogue or articulated
    narration. But note also that I am not claiming a direct or constant parallel
    between verbal and typographic articulation. Using italics to indicate foreign
    words is also typographic articulation, assisting higher level processing of text.
    I use the term articulation because of the parallels that often do exist and because
    typographic articulation, like verbal articulation, makes the meaning of language
    clearer. <BR> <BR>I suspect we are talking at cross purposes, again, because you
    are obsessing about what happens in the lowest level of reading comprehension
    -- word identification -- and I am talking about typographic articulation that
    exists primarily to assist higher levels of reading comprehension -- textual understanding.
    Once again, I take readability as a given -- it&#39;s not an achievement, it&#39;s
    a prerequisite --: there&#39;s no point to any sophisticated typographic articulation
    if people can&#39;t read. But people can read, and do read, and the goal of their
