  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have teamed up with rummik (rummik.com) to make an online font editor called <a href="http://www.fontclod.com">Fontclod</a> (with a purposed typo of &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;). Alpha 0 was released earlier today as a proof-of-concept, and includes placing, deleting, moving points, and basic save/load (copy/paste in the upper-right text-box).</p>
<img src="http://www.fontclod.com/screenshots/alpha0.png">
<!--break-->
We want to develop it into a fully featured font editor, with optimization for mobile platforms like iPad. But to do so in a relatively short time frame, we need financial backing. At present, higher sums = higher priority on feature requests, but you can pledge any amount. Those who are willing to pledge sums of 150+ USD will also get free access for unlimited font hosting when this feature is implemented. There is a support button on the bottom right.
<p>To make the best editor possible, we need your input! If you have any features you would really like to see, or any misgivings about other font editors, please list them here! Also please feel free to use this as much as you can for testing, just let us know when you spot bugs! Feel free to discuss here.</p>
<p>We plan on trying to have at least one release in any given work-week.</p>
<p><strong>Some planned features of Fontclod:</strong>
We plan to keep all the basic editing functions free
Multiple font editing
Interpolated editing tool (like interpolated nudge or Fontlab&rsquo;s interpolate function)
Importing and exporting to UFO
Most functions supported by UFO</p>
<p><strong>What we don&rsquo;t plan on doing at this point:</strong>
Non-cubic contours
Hinting
Bitmap fonts</p>
<p>Right now we want to focus on basic editing functions, so we wont be doing importing or exporting to standard formats yet. The format is just a JSON representation of the internal data structure. If you would like to tackle a simple converter, please contact us.</p>
<p>Soon we will be having some surveys to help us decide the best interface layouts. (You can tell us your opinion right now if you want.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>
<p>you guys should totally merge your project with Raph’s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one problem with merging Fontclog and Fontly: licencing. Part of the framework Fontclog is using is closed source, and Fontly will be presumably released under the GPL license. The viral nature of GPL prevents us from using it. I did contact Raph, though he hasn&rsquo;t gotten back to me. Fontly does appear to be dead right now.</p>
<p>The font format, and almost all of our drawing and editing functions will be available free (libre) in libraries, probably under either the LGPL or BSD license. We&rsquo;d like to release a stand-alone version using XULRunner eventually, allowing anyone to contribute to the codebase. All the libraries would be shared, so most of the functions on the web will be available open-source, on your own computer (without the use of PHP).</p>
<p>Touching Spiros: We very much would like to use Spiro splines eventually. There really needs to be a better Spiro implementation than fontforge&rsquo;s. To move font editing along further, we also need to get beyond beziers. To do this, unless Raph releases part of Fontly (there&rsquo;s a pseudo-working online Spiro example here: <a href="http://fontly.com/sandbox/spiro.html">http://fontly.com/sandbox/spiro.html</a>) in a more friendly license, like LGPL or BSD, we&rsquo;ll have to write our own Spiro interpreter completely from scratch. There&rsquo;s no reason the two projects shouldn&rsquo;t be able to share code, though.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I can see your point, but I would beg to differ. For those of us who use multiple computers day-in-day-out, not having our software on every system is frustrating, and there are times that we can&rsquo;t install the software on every system because of licensing issues, build problems because of OS, or inability because of outside restrictions. An online font editor (coupled with cloud hosting for fonts) would allow you to edit fonts from <em>anywhere</em> I would take this very seriously. And this would allow use, out-of-the-box, of editing on mobile platforms like iPad and Zoom. This also removes cross-platform development woes all together.</p>
<p>Imagine this: A man works on his font project before work, on his Mac, then continues work on his iPad riding on the sub, at work he&rsquo;s able to continue during his break on Windows. All the while he doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about copying font files between devices. While most of us probably don&rsquo;t want to drink type in the way, the possibilities are all there.</p>
<p>What I mean is, there&rsquo;s no reason to call this a toy. :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Difficult to work with it on Mac</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fix for this will be in the next version. :) I do have a Mac, but mainly I&rsquo;m using Linux now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nice but, uhm, no undo?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to try and squeeze this into the next release also.</p>
<p>The main reason we&rsquo;ve posted it this early in development was in order to get some alpha funding to help pay for development, but so far no one&rsquo;s taken the bait! Our time isn&rsquo;t free here. :)</p>

<p>Released alpha 1! Most of the bugs from the last release are fixed. Rendering of the glyph being edited is rewritten, so it&rsquo;s a lot faster. The ability to select multiple handles, and nudging has been added! You can remove handles by selecting them and pressing backspace. Press space to move the view. Also: preliminaries for multiple glyphs (no UI yet), and undo. Read the changelog for everything else. Note: point adding is missing from this version, it&rsquo;ll be back next week! :)</p>

<img src="http://21326.info/fontclod/mockup-b.png" />
<p>I decided to go with a more &ldquo;minimal&rdquo; styling which I thinks work better for most webapps. I also decided to go with a more traditional menu structure because of the nature of a font editor. Both the tool palette and palettes on the right are quite WIP. I haven&rsquo;t decided on a default set of tools or palettes yet. The glyph chooser at the bottom will be expandable, and be subset with filters.</p>
<p>Anyway, thoughts on this mockup would be highly appreciated. :)</p>

<p>Looks great. One thing, and maybe you&rsquo;ve already got it: keyboard command equivs&hellip; Especically for next and prev glyphs.</p>
<p>I hate having to use a menu command when all I want to do is step through a sequence.</p>
<p>I will need to log into the app and give it another run through before making further comments!</p>
<p>Many thanks for the cool app.
I&rsquo;m a professional user of FontLab et al for decades, but I really think this is a fantastic experiment and proof of concept for Web 3 application development AND a real gift to the non-professional who can&rsquo;t pony up the cash for a dedicated application.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t recall offhand what the output formats are&hellip;</p>
