body: "Hi All, \r\n\r\nI started a series of short interviews with type designers
  on my design studio's website. \r\n\r\nWe're based in Tokyo, and the primary goal
  of the articles is to introduce some contemporary western typefaces and designers
  to Japanese designers who may have a hard time finding information about these typefaces
  in their language. All interviews are available in Japanese and English.\r\n\r\nHere
  are the first four in the series:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.aqworks.com/2007/08/14/facetime-4-type-designer-chester-jenkins-on-galaxie-polaris/|Chester

  body: The interviews are good reads, but honestly, some of them are a little lightweight.
    Chester's interview has some really good parts (Galaxie Polaris as a 21st century
    typeface, how it compares to other grotesques), but, being a huge fan of Jeremy
    Tankard, I wish that the questions went beyond just Bliss to his other projects.
    Nevertheless, I'm adding the blog to my feedreader.

    process but it's still cool to read some words especially from relatively young
    designers. Didn't even knew Jarno Lukkarila. Btw, the link http://www.jarnolukkarila.com/
    is wrong on the website.\r\nThanks"

  body: "I really like this paragraph from the Tankard interview:\r\n><strong>How
    important is it for designers to understand typographic history when choosing
    to use Bliss? If it \u201Cjust works\u201D for a project, is that also OK?</strong>\r\n\r\n>The
    history element is the way I work. I, like many designers, can not design in a
    vacuum. I believe that we learn from the past in order to design for the future
    whilst working in the present. The history of type is fascinating and is constantly
    evolving. This is all wrapped up in my appreciation of type and my day to day
    work with type. It doesn\u2019t necessarily matter that a designer using Bliss
    (or another other type) should know its history, but as it is part of its design,
    it\u2019s story may as well be passed on. Sometimes the history of a type (its
    heritage if you like) can be of great benefit in convincing a client that it is
    the right type for them to invest in and use.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like that line of reasoning. "

  body: "\r\nThanks everyone for the feedback, especially the broken link tip.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the 'lightweight' or short length of the interviews. There are two reasons for
    this. \r\n\r\n1. My target audience for these is the average Japanese graphic
    designer, who is coming to the site with a lot less knowledge of the history,
    terminology, and state of the art of western typeface design. \r\n\r\nThe shorter
    length and mostly simple questions allows these readers to pick up a few points
    of interest about each face, learn a few things about type design in general,
    before moving on to other sites to find out more about both. \r\n\r\n2. My experience
    interviewing designers for magazines has been that they are often very busy people
    with erratic schedules. I wanted the interviews to be something that they could
    complete in half an hour, perhaps instead of reading RSS with their morning coffee.
    \r\n\r\nThe result, many were very busy with the rest of their job, but almost
    everyone I contacted answered my questions thoughtfully within a week or so. A
    few generous designers (like Chester) invited follow-ups, which is why some are
    longer than others.\r\n\r\nOur website is not exactly the New York Times, so I
    appreciate that they took the time they did. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn another note,
    since you graciously offered, I'd like to ask a bit of advice:\r\n\r\n1. I'm going
    to stop this series at six designers. But if I did it again in 3 months, who else
    would you like to see interviewed?\r\n\r\n2. I'm thinking of doing a similar series
    on Japanese contemporary typefaces and designers. Would this interest you? What
    types of things would you want to know about them?"

    my head: Frantisek Storm, Martin Majoor, Fred Smeijers, Kris Sowersby\r\n\r\nQ2:
    Yes I would be interested. I wish I had better insight into the issues in their
    work - and clearly your interview structure isn't the place to find out. I would
    be interested in How they see western Glyphs and what they like making best -
    and why. For subjects : How about Kunihiko Okano?"

    you mentioned as to the length of the interviews as I posted, but forgot to mention
    that I had considered them. Any interview is better than no interview, and these
    are very interesting interviews at that.\r\n\r\nI'd love to see Christian Schwartz
    answer a few questions, maybe Joshua Darden, Xavier Dupre, and Jean-Francois Porchez,
    too. I'd be very much in favor of Eben's suggestions also. And Akira Kobayashi
    could be a good \"in-between\" interview for the site."
