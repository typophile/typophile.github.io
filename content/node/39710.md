  futura but b and d have distinct features. Looks similar to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/standup/d-regular/|Standup]]
  but again not exactly.\r\n\r\nSecond one having strange 1, different from other
  letters, otherwise looking like [[http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.htm?pid=242991|Compacta]]
  or HelveticaCond.\r\n\r\nSorry if i messed up with something, thank you."
