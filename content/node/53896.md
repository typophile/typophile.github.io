  pictures were all taken on Oak St. in New Orleans. All the signs above are made
  with wood and paint that hang from chains or are attached to poles or the building
  itself. These are unlike other places because many modern day signs are made out
  of plastic and lights attached to light up the signs. Also many signs in other places
  are not wriiten on a board but composed of individual letters posted straight onto
  a building. A lot of signs in New Orlans look hand drawn or painted which gives
  it an artsy look or vibe. New Orleans signs are unique because they stick to tradition
  and not what is new and fashionable.  "

    create blogs about NO signage?
