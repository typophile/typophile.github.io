    Type ID Board  <BR>introduction. Nice job, Nathan! And thanks for the link: <BR>I
    wasn&#39;t really aware of Lipton&#39;s script. A beauty innit?'

  body: Thanks Yves. I&#39;m the absolute worst at font IDs, but I happened to be
    using this one the other day ;-&#41; It&#39;s the alternate forms that really
    get me going...except for that squirrely little &#34;d&#34; which gives me nightmares.

    <BR>That always has been for me the factor that tilts  <BR>the scales in deciding
    whether to buy the license  <BR>to a typeface or not. <BR>&#40;My gawd this is
    crummy English! Let me rephrase  <BR>that: &#34;me like type with alternate forms
    too&#34;&#41;. <BR>That, and the presence of &#34;fine typography&#34; tools  <BR>like
    oldstyle figures, extended sets of ligatures,  <BR>small caps etc. That&#39;s
    why I&#39;m a sucker for House  <BR>Industries&#39; font families for example.
    How many  <BR>UC &#34;Q&#34;-forms do you want in your <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTRAFACE-FO&amp;sub=features"
    target="_blank"> Neutraface</a>? Are  <BR>3 different versions of <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALET-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank"> Chalet</a> enough for you? ;&#41; <BR> <BR><i>&#62;except for
    that squirrely little &#34;d&#34; which gives  <BR>me nightmares.</i> <BR> <BR>Dunno,
    I&#39;m quite fond of squirrels myself... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
