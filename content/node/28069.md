  of designing some labels for a new well being drink, (kind of a mix between a health/energy/vitamin
  drink). We have designed quite a few labels which the client is happy with but now
  they want to see a version in the style of a beer label. \r\n\r\nSo I ask you, as
  I am sure you all drink beer, can anyone suggest any fonts that might fit into the
  beer/wellbeing category. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance..\r\n\r\nMatt"
