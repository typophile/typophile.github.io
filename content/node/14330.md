body: "Hi to all,\r\n\r\nI wish to hear your opinions about one of the newest type
  foundries who follows the same direction of humanist emotional connotations who
  inspired me everyday on my latino vernacular handpainted neighbourhood signage.\r\nI
  think that the sense of humor and the emotional relation of his products samples
  design to his customers its a great strategy.\r\nThe Logo brand its a handpainted
  swashy lettering who is very similar to some humoristic comercial signage here in
  Chile..\r\nI think that Sauna and Dolly are the better works from Underware until
  now, because they are very versatile. Auto its a great work too but its ductos is
  maybe too much squared and geometrical. Bello pro its a nice Display font but i
  think that its very hard to read..maybe they can do a better version keeping the
  same flavour but adding more functionality as a type. I wish to add some critique
  to his display works because i feel that i am in the same way or direction to this
  guys and i like to see more and more type designs like Dolly and Sauna from independent
  designers.\r\n\r\nBTW, i like to know which method use Underware to design fonts,
  they work in group right?\r\nPersonally i wish to be oriented to get sucessful finished
  fonts with a similar way of work..\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nmh."

    stuff you should totally check it out. The projects provide a good insight into
    the way they approach type. www.typeworkshop.com  They also published a little
    booklet called five point that is a good read, I think you can still order it.

  body: "I've become completely enamoured with Underware's work, particularly Dolly,
    Sauna, and Bello. I got my hands on their Dolly and Sauna specimen books w/ free
    trial versions of the fonts (what a great idea) and 5 pts at TypeCon. I opened
    up my laptop on the way home and started playing with the fonts. Underware just
    seem to be genuinely enjoying and loving what they do and having mischievous fun,
    while still doing great work. On top of that, they're teaching students how to
    do the same thing. Their font specimens are full of funny and interesting writing,
    not just strings of meaningless words, another reason I like getting my hands
    on their stuff.\r\n\r\nMy appreciation of their work has a lot to do with what
    I know of Undeware as a whole, not just how much I like the fonts. Their work
    has been instrumental in getting my ass in gear on a font, as well.\r\n\r\nSo,
    yeah. I like Underware."

    2005 showing some black gothic new font in action. It\xB4s anyone informed about
    how Underware work with the elaboration of his fonts? I don\xB4t know if any media
    related magazine or website have interview the underware guys asking similar questions..i
    am looking forward to know more about them.\r\n\r\nBTW, its a good idea for Typographica
    or Typophile to make posts dedicated to interview or make questions to typographers,
    foundries or people who are interesting to learn with.\r\nMaybe a new forum called
    \"Interviews\", depends if the typographers are available or open to respond direct
    questions from users of the forums.\r\n\r\nI think that they first Underware workshops
    rules. Making type solutions for common design issues in a fun way, its something
    that i wish to take too for a model of education in graphic design classes too."

  body: "Miguel, I also am just bowled over the brilliance and freshness of the Underware
    work--and like you I prefer Dolly and Sauna, for the same reasons you give. \r\n\r\nAccording
    to the article Stephen refers to (half in reversed type, white out of mauve, not
    even bolded--give me a break!) the three work as a true collaborative. \r\n\r\nAnd
    there is this: \"[Sami] mentions the importance of the Royal Academy's practical
    approach of hand sketching, where the student learns to trust hand and eye.\"\r\n\r\nHrant
    is always railing against \"chirography\", type influenced by the hand, but judging
    by Underware we should more often let go of the mouse, and pick up the pencil.
    (I know, I know, sketching type and writing are two different things.) \r\n\r\nI
    asked to Karsten Luecke (part of the amazing Village collective, including Underware)
    at TypeCon: \"These Underware guys are so amazing, where *do* they come from?\"
    His answer: \"Holland, of course.\"  Judging by the students and students of students
    of G. Noordzij, I am sure going to reread his book Letterletter again, and read
    the one about to come out in English.  "

    depends on the person. As I said, person, school, nationality, in that order.
    If nationality is emotionally important to the person it becomes more important.
    But school, and here I mean the formative, professional schooling (eg graduate
    school for academics,) I think often trumps nationality, when the person is working
    in the profession. \r\n\r\nRightly or wrongly, I associate rather austere, pristine
    beauty with Dutch, German and Finnish design. Underware has that discipline of
    northern Europe craft, but the exhuberance of Mediteranean countries. I think
    their freedom from national stereotype is part of their charm.   "

    this combination is my personal conection with vernacular signage here in my town.
    I think its amazing to feel that the same forms are present in other cultures.
    It seems like the innocent child face like cute proportions are universal principles
    of design who will be always recognised as fresh, nice, cool, fun and friendly."
