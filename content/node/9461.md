  Behr on the veracity of the Internet: <BR> <BR>&#34;Lasy year four reporters for
  US news network CBS lost their jobs after bloggers exposed as forgeries the documents
  in a CBS story claiming to prove that George W Bush had dodged the Vietnam draft.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>Two things struck me about this, and they kind of go together, in the way
  that information becomes distilled and things are edited out as conventional wisdom
  takes shape. <BR> <BR>Firstly, the distinction between a blog and a forum has gone
  missing. Admittedly, there is a spectrum of hybrid forms between the two, but there
  is a fundamental difference between a forum, where anyone can start a thread, and
  a blog, where the content is directed, not open. But blogging is a phenomenon, especially
  to the print media, so it tends to accrue attribution. <BR> <BR>Secondly, there
  is the question of exposure. News media&#39;s finest hour is when it exposes wrong-doing,
  so it&#39;s understandable that exposure is trumpeted more than discovery. But no,
  it wasn&#39;t &#34;bloggers&#34; who exposed the forgery, it was &#34;typographers&#34;,
  and in particular the forensic acumen of a certain T. Phinney, fonts program manager
  for Adobe Systems. <BR> <BR>Thomas, your 15 minutes are up.'

    <BR> <BR>I think there was also a typophile thread about it.
