  body: "This is a sign that a client saw on a website and has requested the same
    font. Here a link to the website:\r\nhttp://www.sideshowsignco.com/pages/gallery\r\n\r\nAny
    suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I realize that the chances of identifying
    a script handwriting font are slim to none as it is probably a custom job, but
    I have searched for days and can't even find something remotely close to at least
    try and imitate it.\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\n"

    with the left side being higher than the right.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nAny clue
    about the L?"
