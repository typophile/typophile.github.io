  more than for forty hours a week so that I can have time outside of work to keep
  designing type. Something I am interested in is pursuing jobs digitizing existing
  type; this is something I want to do anyway, so I might as well try to get paid
  and work with people who know what they\u2019re doing. \r\n\r\nHow much of this
  work is out there, and what\u2019s the best way to get it? Should I just bring a
  portfolio of whatever fonts I have done to Typecon and talk to people there?"

  body: "The short answer to your question is \"no.\"\r\n\r\nI don't mean at all to
    be flippant with you, so I will keep explaining. It is probably clear to you by
    now that there is no single, direct way into professional type design. We don't
    have the same halfway-accepted system that the graphic design industry has (i.e.,
    major in graphic design, intern, graduate, get a junior designer position, work
    your way up from there in the same or other studios to partnership or going out
    on your own, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhat some of the bigger foundries may use freelancers
    for is character extension. Basically drawing accepts for central and eastern
    European languages, and then testing the font. For this type of thing, yes, you
    could just bring your portfolio of font work to date to TypeCon. There would be
    a few people that you could talk to there. Be aware, though, that there are far
    more designers who can freelance than spots available. In my experiences, a company
    is more than likely to use the freelancer who lives in the same city (or the next
    town over) than someone from far away, at least half of the time or more. Still,
    it does not hurt to try.\r\n\r\nThere are foundries that will distribute digitizations
    of old faces, and there are foundries that do not. Of those that do, you designers
    quite often approach them and ask exactly what you are offering here. And this
    is not usually what happens going forward. Much more common is that the foundry
    will say, \"yes, we would love to distribute the font. If you can digitize it
    yourself and bring it up to standard, we will take it into our program and distribute
    it.\" Then, you would just get small royalties based on sales. They probably wouldn't
    even cover the cost of your working time, actually. But some designers go this
    route for experience's sake."

    own trypefaces in your spare time to keep learning as much as you can. There is
    probably more freelance work available in the techie end of type design than glyph
    drawing (OpenType coding and testing).\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    this might be in designing adding additional script support (i.e., Cyrillic, Greek,
    Arabic, etc.). Becoming a specialist in another script can be a good way to get
    work. "
