  WWII army unit. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GrossdeutschlandSM_6504.jpg]\r\nIt
  might be taken from a uniform wordmark armband. As such, it's lettering. But is
  there a font similar to the lettering? \r\nThanks.\r\nDon\r\np.s. I replaced the
  image with a smaller one to make it easier to follow the script"

  body: "I left the attachment at the original large scale.\r\nThe curve back on the
    ascender is a feature found, in modified form, on the _h_ for Troubadour http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rmu/troubadour-pro/
    and Wagner Script http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/wagner-script/ but \"Grossdeutschland\"
    is a much more cursive script. Troubadour dates from 1926 (Wagner & Schmidt).
    Some variations: Butterfly (Schriftguss), Donatello (Nebiolo), Hertha (Berling)
    [Info. from Jaspert's _Type Encyclopedia_.]\r\nAny suggestions?\r\nDon"
