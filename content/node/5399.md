body: Anyone have any recommendations on what software/file format combination works
  best, when developing type specimens for the web? Will one get better results from
  Photoshop CS compared with Photoshop 5.5 or 7? More specifically, does Photoshop
  / ImageReady CS do a better job of compression than the older versions? I&#39;m
  assuming that it does. PNG or GIF? <BR> <BR>I want nice, smooth, lovely, type specimens,
  that load quickly. And I&#39;m seeking some typophile wisdom

  body: 'many thanks, ya&#39;ll! stephen, i was hoping you would chime in actually.
    : &#41; did you have a part in the specimens for Stefan Hattenbach&#39;s Delicato?
    Loved that PDF he put together.  <BR>Now that you mention it, I would love to
    use Illustrator for producing type specs for the web. I love working with type
    in Illustrator. Are you referring to Illustrator CS here? Can you crop stuff when
    you export?  <BR> <BR>And David, thanks for the compliment on my &#39;jy&#39;.
    It&#39;s the result of blood, sweat, frustration, good professors, cramped hands,
    etc... from college. i&#39;m always surprised people see the &#39;y&#39; actually. '

    <BR>Stephen, that is hilarious &#40;and so true&#41;! I might have to use that
    line. <BR> <BR>Jon, seriously go with Illustrator. If you are using CS, you will
    have a bit more typographical control than previous versions of AI &#40;like a
    fancy glyph window and OpenType features&#41;, however it certainly isn&#39;t
    necessary to export very nice type specs. <BR> <BR>Zara'

  body: 'all right, so i just exported a png from illustrator. just a line of type.
    looks good. easy. crops it nicely too.  <BR> <BR>i can just sense the refreshing
    breeze of Illustrator and Photoshop CS &#40;in terms of their typographic skillz&#41;.
    not sure i can wait any longer.   <BR> <BR>but this helps. i never bothered to
    check out Illustrator&#39;s exporting options. thanks. '

  body: 'just tried it in illustrator. nice. i like it. never bothered to look in
    depth at illustrator&#39;s exporting options! not sure i can avoid CS applications
    any longer. <BR> <BR>Jonathan, for some reason i have abandoned Macromedia completely.
    I&#39;m not sure why. I think maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t like their packaging.
    a dumb reason, i know. it&#39;s sort of the same way with me for sports teams.
    the nicer their uniform, the more i like the team. like, the pittsburgh steelers,
    for instance. greatest team on the planet. and they just recently started using
    futura &#40;at least i&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s futura&#41; for the numbers
    on their uniforms. that was a good day in pittsburgh, when that happened. no one
    else seemed to care though.  <BR> <BR>thanks for the illustrator hints. just what
    i needed. '

  body: Just how much better they are is subject to debate, but I can say for sure
    that Adobe&#39;s anti-aliasing schemes have continued to evolve over time, and
    that the CS apps are not identical to the previous generation. <BR> <BR>T
