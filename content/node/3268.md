body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I am trying to identify the script font used on a book I&#39;ve
  recently purchased - &#34;The Art of Promotion&#34; by Rockport Publishers. I have
  already tried &#34;What the Font&#34; on myfonts.com, and no luck. I am attaching
  a portion of the cover, as well as a paragraph from the back. Of particular note
  are the capitals, and the counters in letters like l, h, etc.  <BR> <BR>Thanks in
  advance for any help you can give me on this.  <BR> <BR>Best, Chris Keegan<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27080.jpg"
