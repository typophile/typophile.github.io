body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nAbout four months ago, I asked for some help with a [[http://www.typophile.com/node/120859|new
  project]].  Progress has been slower than I would have liked, but I'm back asking
  for your thoughts on my initial ideas for the italic version of the same font.\r\n\r\nHere's
  what I have so far.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/120859\r\n\r\nAnd, for
  the purposes of comparison, here's where I'm at with the original project.\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/91e209e0cb.pdf\r\n\r\nThe
  italics share the same core design principles of the original, but are not simply
  skewed clones.  Most letterforms have been redrawn, for example, and the 'pinched'
  angles are more pronounced.\r\n\r\nAll feedback would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks."

    has been between 9pt and 14pt.  I haven't fine-tuned bearings on the italics yet,
    because I want to focus on the shapes, but they're generally a little loose because
    riccard0 mentioned the original font was too tight for comfortable reading.\r\n\r\nDo
    you think the original is too loose now?  http://freepdfhosting.com/91e209e0cb.pdf"

  body: "I think the /w/ could still be a touch lighter, but get a second opinion.\r\nI
    don't think the roman is too loose (though the wordspace may be too wide). Because
    italic letters are sloped they are narrower, and the counters consequently smaller,
    so the interlettering space needs to be too. But looking at the small sizes in
    a printout now, I'd only tighten them a hair--it's pretty close to good. Overall,
    though loose and stiff when big, I think this works really well at text sizes.\r\nThe
    /p/ seems to me the most daring character. My eye gets hung up on it a bit, but
    I'm not sure how to advise you to rein it in. Would it be crazy to keep the bowl
    and the ascending stem but snip off the little bit on the left side?"

    taken some height off of the /p/stem, shaved a little extra weight off the /w/

    date.  \r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/53f2e6f711.pdf\r\n\r\nI'm sure I'll come
    back and tweak these further in due course but, for now, I'm going to turn my
    attention to the caps, numerals, etc.  In the meantime, if you spot anything else
    that needs some attention, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: /k/'s arm loop should go higher (have a bit more overshoot over the meanline).
    It looks short next to /c/. Same may be true, to a lesser extent, with /p/'s bowl.

  body: "Hi Andreas,\r\n\r\nMy aim for the italic is to create a sort of half-brother
    to the roman, if that makes sense.  I want them to appear clearly related but,
    at the same time, clearly different.  This is the reason for the alternate style
    /p/.  In fact, only the /v/, /w/, /x/, /y/ and /z/ are simple skewed versions
    of their roman counterparts.  Every other letter has been redrawn.\r\n\r\nI shaved
    a little more off the /p/ stem, mainly to avoid confusion with the /\xFE/.  The
    first draft of the caps has been added, but no numerals yet.\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/8c955fc39b.pdf"

  body: "Makes sense.\r\n\r\n/m, /n, /r shares the same stem (same look anyways) and
    then you chosen a different stem only for /p which makes it stand out still after
    you've cut it. I'm new to this game so can't really judge if it's \"ok\" :)\r\n\r\nLooking
    at it again i feel like the middle part of the /s has a too perfect curve compared
    to the generally more jagged appearance of the rest."

  body: I do like some exuberance in italics, but for |<em>p</em>| not to look too
    much out of place, you probably would need to give your slanted letters more cursive
    shapes too.

  body: "You're right about the s - but on e.g. n it's a bigger % of what's normally
    curved that becomes \"jagged\"...I don't know...just looking at most of the other
    letters I would have expected the s to be less \"smooth\".\r\n\r\nRegarding the
    /p then the second is better for reading but the first is more interesting (for
    lack of better word).\r\n\r\nI'm unsure about the /z with it's non-straight line,
    when the lines in /x /v /y /w are more straight and the modifications to the other
    letters in general is of the \"jagged\" kind."

  body: "Andreas, I've reverted to a more conventional /p/.  I've reviewed the /s/
    again and again, and remain happy that it is consistent.  I take your point about
    the /z/; I tried straightening it and also making the kink 'harder', but preferred
    the original.  I may return to it again, but my focus has been on creating a set
    of italic Greek characters.  \r\n\r\nHere's the latest version, showing pangrams
    in various languages, each in italic and then roman for comparison.\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/162b20fa48.pdf\r\n\r\nWhilst
    I've included Latin scripts, I'm most interested in feed back on the Greek at
    this time.  \r\n\r\nYou'll notice the Greek italic at the top is not simply a
    skew, but a redraw, with some characters (alpha, beta, theta, kappa, rho and phi)
    taking completely different forms.  Firstly, any issues with the way the characters
    are drawn?  Secondly, are these different letterforms a bit <em>too</em> 'different'
    to be standard?\r\n\r\nAs always, all thoughts on any aspect is most welcome.\r\n\r\nEdit
    to add: please ignore spacing; I'm focussing primarily on the shapes.\r\n\r\n"
