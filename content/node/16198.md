body: "I am a beginner to the world of typography and have what seems to be a rather
  basic question about typeface purchasing.  Carter and Cone's licensing agreement
  (for ITC Galliard CC) includes the following paragraph:  \r\n\r\n\"The Software
  is licensed for use on a single output device such as a laser printer, film recorder,
  high-resolution typesetting device, or other such imaging device. If you need to
  use the Software on more than one output device, you need to upgrade to a multi-printer
  license.\"\r\n\r\nCan anyone elucidate this for me?  How can they expect a user
  to utilize a single printing device?  (Note that I'm attempting to purchase a typeface
  for the first time and am hesitant to spend the money being unsure of what I'm getting.)"

    here, as a search of this forum will reveal. See<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14264\">
    The End User's Manifesto.</a>\r\n\r\nEvery font foundry is free to set their own
    terms of use, and the font user is free to accept them, negotiate with the vendor,
    or look elsewhere for their fonts. \r\n\r\nThe terms offered by this licensing
    agreement seem pretty clear to me, but it's possible that if you contact Carter
    and Cone you could obtain different terms, or you might find that a multi-printer
    license is within your means. Certainly a license for Galliard CC is a worthwhile
    purchase, if you can obtain it on terms you can live with."

  body: "I don't think you'd have to worry if you replaced your printer, but it is
    quite common for foundries to require that outside agencies have their own license
    for fonts you want them to print.\r\n\r\nSome foundries allow you to supply fonts
    to an outside agency if the fonts are only used to output your work, but that's
    rather unusual. Many, but certainly not all, foundries will allow you to make
    a PDF for output.\r\n\r\nAgain, the simple fact is that the EULAs can say whatever
    the foundry wishes...they can require you to only use their fonts to promote dental
    hygiene if they wish: it's their prerogative. (Within the limits of the law.)
    \ It's up to you to read and understand the EULA before you buy. If you don't
    like the terms, or you don't understand them, by all means contact the foundry.\r\n\r\nDifferent
    foundries have different terms, and you should take those terms into consideration
    when buying. It even happens that the same font can be offered on different terms
    from different vendors."

  body: Frankly, I think this particular wording is a hangover from Ye Olden Days,
    when font outlines had to be loaded onto the output device (like to old Compugraphic
    photosetters). With all the newfangled contraptions available today, the outlines
    are downloaded to the printer when you send the job and, in a typical printshop
    workflow, that might mean sending it to a laser printer for rough proofing, then
    a color laser for intermediate proofing, a color plotter for final proofing, and
    a film or CTP imagesetter for final output. Foundries should perhaps <em>read</em>
    their own EULAs and adjust them accordingly to reflect working realities, consarn
    it.

  body: "I agree that the one output device restrictions seems very, well, very restrictive,
    and I've never been clear what it really means in practice. \r\n\r\nIf I have
    2 printers, e.g. an inkjet and a laser printer, and they're both connected to
    my computer, well, yes, it seems clear that a \"single output device\" EULA would
    see me buying a second license. \r\n\r\nBut, as Louis has pointed out, surely
    I don't need to buy a new license when I replace my printer. \r\n\r\nWell, what
    about if I decide I'll never print Galliard on my inkjet, only on my laser. Surely
    that's okay, right? \r\n\r\nNow I'm on a slippery slope: can I change my mind,
    and say I'll only use it on the inkjet starting tomorrow? Would it be okay if
    I unplugged one printer when I was using the other? \r\n\r\nClearly it takes no
    time at all for the situation to become absurd. So, the best thing really is to
    contact the foundry and ask for different terms, and hope they rewrite their EULA,
    if not for everyone, at least for you."

  body: "Oldnick was right.  I just got a reply from Cherie Cone wherein she stated
    that Fontshop's C&C license is a tad on the ancient side.  She forwarded me C&C's
    current EULA.  The critical section appears below:\r\n\r\n\"The Software is licensed
    for use on a single central processing unit (CPU). If you need to use the Software
    on more than one such device, you need to upgrade to a multi-user license.\"\r\n\r\nThat
    is, \"single output device\" should now read \"single central processing unit\".\r\n\r\nNow
    that that's clear, and it seems to be a rather common restriction, I assume that
    I am permitted to install the font on any one computer at a given time.  That
    is, surely I may install the font on an infinte number of PCs provided that I've
    removed it from the previous unit(s), correct?\r\n\r\nIf I am to print through
    outside sources, which I am now presuming to be legal, am I correct to assume
    that the font need not be installed on such PCs in order to print my work?  Is
    it possible to re-work documents on PCs without the font installed?  (I presume
    it is not.)"

    you would be taking advantage of the foundry if you did use your line of thinking

    require further refinement and explanation for all. I do suggest you contact Cherie
    Cone again and explain your intended use. You are obviously not the type of person
    to harm Carter and Cone's business by your font usage. Surely Cherie will see
    that embedding is a vital part of the publishing workflow now, and will have some
    way to satisfy all your usage needs without excess expense or hoop-jumping. \r\n\r\nOne
    reason I suggest resolving this with C+C is that you will be getting the most
    authoritative, complete, and useful version of Galliard that can be had; it's
    a little like having your shoes handmade custom for you. Get all the parts; the
    small caps of Galliard are splendid.  "

    what your intended use is, hey should be willing to offer you a personalised EULA.\r\n\r\nAs
    has been stated elsewhere on this site, many EULAs have been written and re-written
    to deal with particular circumstances, like say: A purchaser buys a font license,
    she then embeds particular phrases set in the font in PDFs which she sells for
    profit. As a result, she is eating into potential sales of the font. (This is
    purely hypothetical.) The foundry would likely, and understandably, respond with
    a knee jerk: banning all embedding.\r\n\r\nThe result of this protectionism is
    that honest people are made to feel like potential criminals, and are restricted
    in the use of the fonts. All because of a few bad apples.\r\n\r\nI salute you
    for wanting to legally license \"Galliard\" because it is a great typeface, and
    you want to raise the visual quality of your documents.\r\nc"
