  to \"Franchise\" (http://www.dafont.com/franchise.font). \r\nI'm looking for some
  non-free alternatives that I can alter a little bit to make the restaurant logo
  I'm working on more unique.\r\nSo far,  I've found Tungsten, but it's lacking a
  bit of personality. Thanks in advance! \r\n\r\nI've attached an early version.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonthelp_4772.jpg]"
