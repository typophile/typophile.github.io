  body: "Thanks, guys. \r\n\r\nNJ McLellan, it looks like yours is the closest. \r\n\r\nVertigoMindwarp,
    you're right. Vertigo isn't the same but has a very similar feeling. I like the
    monospace feel of it. Very interesting option. Thanks for pointing it out. And
    it's free! :)\r\n\r\nI'll also keep hunting around an let you guys know if I find
    something closer. Thanks!"
