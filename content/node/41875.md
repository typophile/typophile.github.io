    Bureau's</a> might be the closest match in width.

  body: "Thanks Stephen.\r\n\r\nMy concern is correctly labeling the drawers rather
    than recreating it really.\r\nIs just calling it Century Condensed 36pt. a close
    enough label?\r\n\r\nI suppose the only way to i.d. the exact typeface would be
    through sample\r\nbooks as opposed to online digitizations?\r\n\r\nAre there any
    online sources you know of for such things? \r\n\r\n "

  body: "Looking in Mac McGrew's great book on \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth
    Century\" I can see that this looks identical to ATF's Century Bold Condensed,
    designed by Morris Benton in 1906, and released in 1909. This type was produced
    in sizes from 6 to 72 point, and also available from Monotype, Intertype and Ludlow,
    if I read the notes correctly.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    for this endeavor.\r\nI will continue to post my proofs of anything interesting
    I come across, maybe \r\nthey will inspire some revitalizations.\r\n\r\n\u2014Derek\r\n\r\n"
