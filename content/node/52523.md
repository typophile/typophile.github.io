body: At first glance this has some similarities to Trajan but it's clearly not that.
  Can anyone help me find out what it is? Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Playhouse-logo_4185.jpg]

    different, and so are the serifs, so I don't think it's Trajan that's been altered.
    \r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I've seen this font or something similar a long while
    ago, but I can't remember the font's name - my memory is so bad these days..."

    work from the 30's with a bit more thick/thin variation. I believe the O is implanted
    and this could be a bad redrawing of his work. Note the structure of the W and
    the leg of the R. The weights are all over the place so it could have possibly
    been drawn/painted by a drunk signpainter : )\r\n\r\n.Michael"

    enough, as I went through the site guess what type appeared... are you ready...
    ALBERTUS! Those stem to \"serif\" transitions are pretty hard to mistake!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture7_6064.png]\r\n\r\nMichael"

    given it, which is the image in my first post, (even though I asked for a high
    resolution image!) looks like it's a photo of a bad photocopy of a scan, which
    might explain some distorting effects. Certainly the U has bleached out a lot,
    becuase looking at the sign on the Playhouse building the counter of the U joins
    up to the spur; there isn't a gap as in the image above.\r\n\r\nThanks to all
    for your helpful posts. I still haven't found the font."

  body: "Mark\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the Albertus on the windows I figured they brought
    in someone to do some additional work and they probably said \"can you emulate
    this?\" But as I said if you look at the stem to serif transitions you can definitely
    see the relation. When I first looked at your attachment the Albertus alarm went
    off because some of the critical characters are direct draws with perhaps a little
    bit of inexperience with thick and thin thrown in. The upper left join of the
    N is different and the terminals of the E, C and S don't match but that is why
    I said he/she was inexperienced. If you look at the playroom piece you can see
    the same small O that is monoline and the \"serif\" structure I am talking about.\r\n\r\nBut
    then it could just be an ugly free font : )\r\n\r\nMichael"
