    \"v\" and \"e\" in Olivetti gives it a interesting appearance."

  body: "Closer to Clarendon than Century I think.\r\n\r\nClarendon Text Italic from
    Canada Type shares the same structures (in the \"e\", \"v\", and \"k\"), although
    proportions and details are a bit different.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/italic/"

  body: "That might mean that if the sample is as pre-digital as it looks, it would
    probably be Aldo Novarese's Egizio, which was the inspiration behind the italic
    styles of Clarendon Text as stated <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/\">on
    MyFonts</a>.\r\n\r\nThis digitization of Egizio looks even closer:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/urw/urw_egizio/"

  body: "Awesome. Apparently David Berlow drew \"Belizio\" based on Novarese's work.\r\n[[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Belizio/styles]]\r\nBelizio
    is lighter than URW's and so seems even closer to what we see in the Olivetti
    Ad here. \r\n\r\nThis specimen on flickr is of the original (I think)\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/17208860@N00/27824342]]"
