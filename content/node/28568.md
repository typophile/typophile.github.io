  body: "I have been unable to find any italic face with this kind of 'z', which drives
    me to consider if the 'z' is transplanted from a script face. For example, the
    'z' from Edwardian Script seems quite close.\r\n\r\nThen, I think, the quest is
    which italic matches the rest of these letters. One candidate I think might be
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/caslon-no-540/\">Caslon 540 italic</a>.
    You would need to tweak the i and remove the b serif, and then I think it would
    be hard to distinguish from your sample.\r\n\r\nThis is admittedly a compromize
    approach, but it might meet your criteria \"its got to be a match, or so close
    as to be almost indistinguishable from the original\". Side-by-side comparison
    is usually too strict a criteria, I think. Look at one and then the other, and
    see if you think the appearance <em>seems</em> the same.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
