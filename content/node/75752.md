  Innovations dynamic new geometric \"stencil\" sans font\r\n\r\nArtist Statement\L\r\nI
  have been in the type design business for more than three decades. I started my
  career with Mergenthaler Linotype (aka Linotype-Hell) in 1976. I was fortunate to
  have worked with Matthew Carter, David Berlow and many other world-renowned type
  designers. It was a privilege to work with John Quaranta, a 30-year veteran designer
  who was my mentor, my colleague and my friend. In those early days, I worked with
  pen and pencil and used specially designed optical lens and cameras to modify and
  convert many ITC typefaces over to the \"Linotype Font Library\". We also cut \"friskets\"
  from our hand drawn letters in the photographic conversion process to \"photo'\"
  and later for \"digital\" printing systems. Shortly thereafter, we utilized the
  \"Ikarus\" computer system to hand digitize and interpolate many new weights and
  typeface designs. And then, everything changed with \"Adobe PostScript\" and the
  new font technologies. I even worked closely with Apple on it's \"Quickdraw GX\"
  multi-master font technologies which later became the \"OpenType\" font standard
  for both Mac and PC.\r\n\r\nI have worked on many hundreds of different typeface
  designs during my career with Linotype. And I was fortunate to witness and partake
  in all the different stages of type development over the years. During the last
  ten years with Linotype, I worked exclusively on reviving the work of the American
  Type Designers including Dwiggin's \"Electra\" and Ruzicka's \"[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fairfield/|Fairfield]].
  Expanding the styles, weights and functionality of many other designs as well.\r\n\r\nAfter
  Linotype, I worked for a large advertising company, Bozell-Worldwide, known for
  their famous \"Got Milk\" ads. And later, I went to work for \"DoubleDay\" Books
  (aka Bookspan) creating hundreds of book jacket layouts and designs for about 20
  different book clubs. Currently, I work from home as a freelance consultant, allowing
  me to pursue my passion for type design and developing new and innovative fonts.\r\n\r\nIt's
  challenging to add fresh new typeface design ideas with so many fonts out there
  today. To coin a phrase \"All the good type design ideas have already been taken\".
  But, I still keep trying. Although I occasionally do a new text face, the majority
  of my work is in display fonts. Much more interesting to experiment with a single
  font concept then working out and coordinating a super-family of weights, styles
  and fonts. Although, creating \"Geomatrix\" was no small task. I started by modifying
  a weight of my \"[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro/|Contax
  Pro]] and creating an interesting \"stencil\" version. And, I thought the work was
  done. Then, I decided to expand the glyph sets to include \"oldstyle figures\" and
  all the \"Eastern European\" characters sets. I should of stopped there. But, no,
  I had to continue to play with the design to include all sorts of alternate 'capital'
  letter forms and unique 'ligature-type' word combinations. After 1,629 glyphs I
  finally stopped. I hope the effort was worth it. I'm exhausted. \r\n\r\nI would
  like to publicly thank everyone at this \"Type Forum\" for helping me resolve certain
  'encoding' and \"OpenType\" feature issues. Without your help I probably would have
  given up much earlier. Please let me know what you think of \"[[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/type-innovations/geomatrix|Geomatrix]].
  Thank you. And, I'm off to the next font(s) !!!\r\n\r\nManufacturer Statement\L\r\nThe
  font \" [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/type-innovations/geomatrix|Geomatrix]]
  is an original design by Alex Kaczun. It is a dynamic stencil interpretation based
  on his extremely successful \"[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro/|Contax
  Pro]] family of geometric sans typefaces. \"Geomatrix\" is a contemporary stencil
  typeface based on generous proportions and clean, crisp lines.The stencil treatment
  is balanced visually with the stem weight of the font which creates a uniformity
  and harmony within the design. \"Geomatrix\" makes for easy reading and is ideal
  for long lines of copy. It exudes a strong sense of sophistication for a true stencil
  design.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is no ordinary stencil typeface. That's putting it
  mildly. Geomatrix is a font on 'STEROIDS\"! This unique OpenType font incorporates
  hundreds of \"CAPITAL\" alternate letter forms and glyph substitutions, automatically
  and on the fly, within \"InDesign\" and other \"OT\" applications. To turn this
  feature on, just typeset 'ALL CAPS\" and go into InDesign's 'OpenType>Stylistic
  Sets' and select 'Set 1' from the menu. Turn character kerning from \"Metrics\"
  to \"Optical\", adjust tracking to minus 20-30, and start typing to create some
  visually interesting letter substitutions and unique word combinations. \"Geomatrix\"
  was specifically designed to take advantage of the OpenType format, allowing the
  \"Graphic Designer\" a unique tool to achieve the desired degree of possible visual
  typographic effects.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the character sets in \"Geomatrix\" have
  been expanded to include 'oldstyle figures' and all 'Eastern European' accented
  glyphs. Strap in and hold on to your seats. A revolution in new font technologies
  has begun!\r\n\r\nAbout Type Innovations\r\n\"[[\Lhttp://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Type_Innovations/|Type
