  New Zealand.\r\n\r\nChurchward Type started in 1962 as [[Joseph Churchward]]\u2019s
  freelance lettering service. Within six months he had generated enough work to move
  from his job as Senior Artist into setting up Churchward International Typefaces,
  which became one of the largest typesetting companies in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn
  1969 Joseph was asked to submit alphabet designs to Berthold Fototypes and saw immediate
  success. He later went on to sign distribution agreements with D.Stempel AG, Dr
  B\xF6ger Photosatz GmbH/Linotype, Mecanorma-Polyvroom B.V and Zipatone. He self-published
  a handful of original fonts in 1978 becoming the first and only company in New Zealand
  to publish original photo-lettering.\r\n\r\nChurchward International Typefaces was
  forced to close in June 1988 but Churchward Type lives on with a fresh set of independent
  releases. [[David Buck]] has taken on the role of digitisation.\r\n\r\nJoseph continues
  to draw alphabets and now has a stockpile of over 300 unique alphabets to his name."
