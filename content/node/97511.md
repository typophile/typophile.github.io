  body: Bitstream has done it. For their fonts numbers served as codes, though. Numbers
    also indicate the weight of the font like in Jos Buivenga's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans/|Museo]].

  body: It is something that has long been advised against, but even back in the mid-90s
    we didn't run into actual problems with '1530 Garamond'. It is possible that there
    is some piece of software out there that will gag on a number in one of the key
    font names, but I've not come across it yet.

  body: I have just run a quick test with a Mac Postscript Type 1 font using a number
    in all of the naming fields (relevant to that format) and both Word (2011) and
    InDesign (CS6) picked it up without any problems. I remember encountering some
    issues with some of the Bitstream fonts many years ago but can no longer remember
    exactly what version of the Mac OS I was running or what software threw up the
    problem, though I suspect that it was Quark Passport 4.11 and that using unconventionally
    named fonts was the least of the issues encountered.
