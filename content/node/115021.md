  body: "Hi Bob, good find. Compare three Nexus variations.\r\nNexus Sans Bold:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NexusSansBold_5235.jpg]\r\nNexus
    Sans Bold Small Caps:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NexusSansBoldSmallCaps_5730.jpg]\r\nNexus
    Sans Reg. Small Caps:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NexusSansRegSmallCaps_3439.jpg]\r\nVariation
    3 is the closest match but it's still not 100%. {Note that the Small Caps in 2
    and 3 are shown in a slightly larger point size than the Caps in 1.]\r\nDon"

    very much for the suggestions, they are very close.\r\nNotice the \"k\" in the
