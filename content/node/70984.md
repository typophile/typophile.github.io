body: "Hi all. I am trying to identify this font which shares traits with Trajan.
  Uppercase letters such as the /N/ are obviously very similar, but this is a bit
  sharper. Lowercase letters have some distinct differences from other fonts typically
  paired with Trajan. Most notably the /a/ and /f/.\r\n\r\nAny ideas here? All help
  is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers."

    first ones I turned to when trying to figure this out. \r\n\r\nTF Arrow does seem
    to have a few similarities but not enough to make me think this is just a modification
    of it. Too many noticeable differences.\r\n\r\nHmmm. This is really bugging me.\r\n\r\nAny
    other takers?\r\n\r\n"

    closer than most of the other suggestions I have looked at.\r\n\r\nMaybe a customized

  body: "I designed <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/byington/\">Byington</a>
    as Trajan column lettering with a lowercase.  It was commissioned by Roxio Inc.
    for use in DVD menus. It doesn't have the subtlety of other Trajans as it was
    fine tuned for use on TV; sharp points and thin lines avoided to prevent interlace
    flicker.\r\n\r\nI've seen an ad for Victoria's secret that paired a nice lowercase
    with Trajan caps. It was a promotion for a TV runway show or something around
    2004."
