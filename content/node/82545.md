  \"Glyphs\". Don't know a lot about it, but it apparently is Mac-only and is aimed
  primarily at graphic designers. The website is http://glyphsapp.com and it's also
  in Apple's App Store.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/glyph2_5139.jpg]"

    okay, but for a few extra bucks why not buy FontLab.\r\n\r\nNot very user friendly...and
    I haven't tired or tested making a font with it yet.\r\n\r\nInteresting..."

  body: "Not user friendly? \r\nI use GLyphs and find it much more easy to use and
    enjoyable than FL.\r\nFL costs 2 times GL, is a conceptually old software, obliging
    you to do many stupid tasks by hand (stupid means the machine can do them as well).
    Glyph does it for you.\r\nOf course some features are still more developed in
    FL. We'll see for FL6, but if they don't change quickly they'll end like Quark
    Xpress ;)"
