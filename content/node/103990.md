body: "This is the font used by a client whose menu I am re-vamping. Their last designer
  was in Denver, and the font is used all over their old menu. I can't seem to find
  the exact match, and I don't think the \"A\" is customized, as it's all over the
  old menu. Thanks for any leads you might have!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font

  body: do you have any other sample words? these letters look very rough, but the
    roughness is consistent like they were drawn and then copied. strange to me. maybe
    not to someone else.

  body: You saved me! I used your image to find this font because the one I was trying
    to match was too low res. It's "Archeologicaps" in case anyone in the future needs
    to know.
