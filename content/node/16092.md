body: "This is driving me absolutely bonkers: a friend of mine runs a <a href=\"http://www.helenscarsdale.com/\">small
  record label</a> that features releases with beautiful, if austere, handmade packaging.
  For his most recent <a href=\"http://www.helenscarsdale.com/published/omittracer.htm\">very
  mysterious</a> release, he went to the <a href=\"http://www.sfcb.org/\">San Francisco
  Center for the Book</a> and used their letterpress to make the cover art. If you've
  been to the center, they have several trays of sorts you can use for lettering,
  most of which have little or no identifying information.\r\n\r\nThe font he used
  for the track titles is an absolutely gorgeous old 8- or 9-point extended gothic
  that looks a lot like Trade Gothic but isn't. The caps remind me a lot of Copperplate
  Gothic with the brackets removed. I've been through my Rookledge and my copy of
  Jaspert, Berry & Johnson pretty closely, and neither of them have a face that has
  the same high middle bars in the BEFHPR combined with the quirked tail on the Q,
  which is one of my favorite features of the typeface. Do any of you with more experience
  with metal type recognize this? It's safe to say that the numbers are in a different
  font, as there are several places elsewhere on the notes where I've caught the designer
  substituting sorts from different fonts in the same word as he runs out of the appropriate
  letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/extended-commercial-gothic.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  can provide higher-resolution portions if it would help.\r\n\r\nI would be very
  surprised if this were available in digital form.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for your
  eyeballs and your attention!\r\n"
