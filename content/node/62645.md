body: "Recently I was working on a project for a client, and realised that they used
  different fonts for their East Asian markets. I was looking in proposing one gothic
  CJK font for the whole region, but had to realise that that'snot so easy.\r\n\r\nI
  know there are Mircosoft fontswhich offer a complete CJK set, but looking for fonts
  with a good variety of weights, to mach them with the latin house-type, was not
  easy at all.\r\n\r\nFor the time we kept the 3 different fonts for C, J & K.\r\n\r\nDid
  anyone else have the same problem?\r\n\r\nj. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/cjk_5023.jpg]"

    serves multiple CJK locales. This is a topic of one of my IUC33 presentations
    that will take place in about two weeks. See: [[http://www.unicodeconference.org/conference-at-a-glance.htm|IUC33]]\r\n\r\nThe
    primary issue is that some CJK Unified Ideographs may require two or more glyphs
    to satisfy the CJK locales, due to Han Unification.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior

  body: "Ken,\r\n\r\nI checked out the link. A very interesting conference indeed.
    But unfortunately I will not be able to come to San Jose.\r\n\r\nIt looks like
    there is no easy fix to my problem. \r\n\r\nI wonder how designers in the region
    deal with it? Are there foundries of fonts (i guess 4 localised versions) that
    match up? \r\n\r\n---\r\nJH, London"

  body: "The iPhone includes two Pan-CJK fonts. They went with the TTC approach, meaning
    that four separate font instances, one for each of the CJK locales (Simplified
    Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), are advertised. Send to me
    an email in a couple of weeks, after IUC33 is over, and I'll send to you my presentation
    about this topic. It will details the issues, the work involved, and various solutions.\r\n\r\nDr.
