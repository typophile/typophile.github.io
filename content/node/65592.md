body: "Ridley is a high-end Belgian bicycle manufacturer with a very amateur-ish wordmark.
  You can see it on one of their bikes here: http://www.maraton.si/images/ridley9/Orionframesetbllue.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
  is NOT AN OFFICIAL PROJECT! I took this upon myself to see if I could refine the
  wordmark to better reflect the quality and prestige of their bicycle frames.\r\n\r\nThe
  first 4 letters (RIDL) I think just need some minor refinements to make them more
  consistent and typographically sound, but the last two letters (EY) really make
  me squirm. I know they could be regarded as \"whimsical\" or somehow \"endearing\",
  but to me they seem highly out of place and almost comically poor in their design.\r\n\r\nPlease
  feel free to critique my refined version, as it is still a work in progress. I appreciate
  the professional opinions of my fellow designers. Have a great day (and a Merry
  Christmas too!) everyone!\r\n\r\nBrian"

    to something as fast & light as a racing bike. And to be honest, i don\u2019t
    see much improvement in your proposal. The first stroke of your R is strange.
    And how the wordmark ends is even worse than the original. It doesn\u2019t read
    as a Y anymore, there is just some bad stroke coming out of the E that leads to
    a I in false degree."

  body: "Thanks for your input. After I posted, I looked at it some more and have
    made some more changes (isn't this always the way). I have to disagree about the
    techy lettering comment though. I think racing bikes are marvels of technology
    and engineering, and I feel the branding should reflect this commitment to always
    make things more high-tech, lighter, more aerodynamic and above all else\u2013faster.
    Look at the wordmarks of LOOK, Giant, TIME, TREK, BMC and Cervelo - they are all
    definitely on the techy side of things, while brands like Colnago, MOOTS, Orbea
    and Wilier are more classical and timeless. I think this look really reflects
    who these companies are and what they produce. A company like Ridley though, I
    feel belongs in the techy camp. They're constantly pushing the boundaries of engineering,
    introducing new technologies and processes and strives to be the best possible
    bikes available. I do appreciate your comments regarding the first and last letters...
    I have taken them into consideration."

    roots of this tiny industry is right. However this techy look of the Ridley wordmark
    is anything than modern and up-to-date, thinking of the carbon technology today\u2019s
    bikes are built upon."

  body: "I do feel yours is an improvement on their wordmark. It's much cleaner and
    tighter (I can't stand their \"E\"). Your 'Y' though does need some refining.\r\n\r\nTry
    making the initial stroke of the 'R' and the last stroke of the 'Y' parallel with
    each other. Also, why does the stroke get fatter at both of those places? Shouldn't
    it \u2014 in keeping with the rest of the letters \u2014 be fixed width? \r\n\r\n-\r\npenn"

  body: "Re: J Weltin - I think you're missing the point a bit here. The goal here
    (set by me) was only to refine their existing wordmark, not a complete overhaul
    or a new design completely. In doing so, I must retain the 'feel' of the existing
    wordmark. Whatever that may be to you is completely subjective.\r\n\r\nRe: penn.and.ink
    - Thanks for your compliments and recommendations. I've made a second version
    (attached) taking into account some feedback I've received here as well as from
    some fellow designers and cyclists on twitter.\r\n\r\nSome notable changes to
    this version:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Reduced the shear angle by about 10 degrees\r\n\u2022
    Made each of the letterforms a bit thinner\r\n\u2022 Reduced the amount of horizontal
    scale\r\n\u2022 Revised the initial stroke of the R and the last stroke of the
    Y to be parallel figures\r\n\u2022 Broke apart the L and E\r\n\u2022 Made more
    of a visual break between the E and the Y\r\n\u2022 Rounded the other top corner
    of the L\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this one sits better. Thoughts?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ridley2_4535.jpg]"

  body: "Your rounding of the corners is inconsistent. Specifically, I and E have
    their top left corners rounded, D doesn't, and L has its right corner rounded.
    \r\n\r\nAlso the middle horizontal stroke in R sticks out for me. I think it should
    really be of the same thickness as the rest of horizontal strokes in the wordmark.
    I understand that it is consistent with E, but IMO they both are better be made
    thicker."

    at that.\r\n\r\ntech aside or not, your approach has an air of rigidity to it...but
    as you're quick to point out, you set the goals yourself. Subjective or not, I
    don't think it retains the same 'feel' as the original.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

  body: "Thanks for all the feedback. This is proving to be much more difficult than
    I had originally planned. The more I look at the original E in the Ridley wordmark,
    the less I hate it. I think it's still rather odd-looking, but as I strive to
    come up with a better solution, I'm beginning to think that their E isn't as terrible
    as I had thought.\r\n\r\nIn regards to the inconsistent rounding of the corners,
    I think that they work in this instance if you look at the space between the letters
    rather than the letters themselves. Maybe. If I were designing a typeface, I would
    probably keep things consistent, but I'm designing a 5-letter wordmark, and as
    such, I'm designing these 5 glyphs to work best in their current setting.\r\n\r\nI
    do think that the middle horizontal stroke in the R and the E could be beefed
    up. Good eye, thanks!\r\n\r\nIn regards to the rigidity... yeah, I hear you. Any
    suggestions on how to make it a little more lively??"

  body: I think if the Y had a bit more movement to it that would help a lot. Right
    now it's really stiff and the only totally straight letterform in the word.

    aware of) would look at a logo mark in that way, nor should you need a disclaimer.\r\n\r\nAs
    for making it less rigid, a couple of things noticed, you removed some of the
    slant, so straight away the mark moves slower, it's also got a lot to do with
    the sweeping lines of the original forms, the rounded R, D and E - you've replaced
    them with more rigid shapes.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul</strong>\r\n<a

    it may help to look at the wordmark not as a set of glyphs from an alphabet, but
    as a composition of 5 specific glyphs and the shapes that they create.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the comments... here is another version. I think I'm slowly getting somewhere
