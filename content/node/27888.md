  Cincinnati,\r\nwe have the option of taking Independent studios, in which we select
  an area of interest (or topic of)\r\nand have a 1 on 1 type of thing where we meet
  with a professor once a week to review the progress of\r\nour work throughout the
  quarter (10-12 weeks.) I am starting to think of things, but am curious to know
  if you were offered this opportunity, what would you do? thanks! \u2014Dan"

    and I mean seriously deep, you could always look at the past theses from the <a
    href=\"http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lt/\">Typography Department at the Univesity
    of Reading</a>. Perhaps something there will ping you in the right way. Click
    on <strong>Research</strong> and then <strong>Past Theses</strong>.\r\n\r\nIn
    addition, you could check out <a href=\"http://www.typeculture.com/\">TypeCulture.com</a>
    which has an amazing collection of materials for research."
