body: "Hi  -\r\n\r\nJust wondering if anyone could suggest a nice alternative to Chevalier
  LP?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chevalier_4269.gif]\r\n\r\nIt would
  be great to find something more condensed, whilst keeping the horizontal line fill
  and sans-serif.\r\nIdeally i love the type on the David Hart & Co logo but am at
  a loss trying to figure out what it is. All suggestions are welcomed.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hart_4973.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

    still prefer the 'C' on the 'David Hart & Co' logo.. but gawd damn, what is THAT
    font! (Thanks again).\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yes it looks like a Bodoni variant but maybe it doesn't exist as a font?

  body: "You might be able to recreate it with an outlined (open) Bodoni mapped over
    a lined background, but if you are willing to look for similar, then <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/eingraviert/\">Eingraviert</a>
    might be close enough.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
