  used as an article header (see bottom 'does it come in black') and as quote highlights
  (see top 'we do an x-factor...')\r\n\r\nI can't be sure if they are exactly the
  same font as the quote example uppercase letters seem to have more ornate stems/tails
  etc than that of the article example which is a continuous trend throughout the
  magazine.\r\n\r\nAny help, even if it similar fonts, or fonts this may be based
  upon greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n"
