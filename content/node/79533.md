body: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nI am publishing a book in which I utilize Dante for
  the typeface and Solemnis for the Display type. At the end of the book I would like
  to put a brief note about these fonts. I am looking for a terse description of these
  two fonts. i.e. Adjectives to describe them and so forth. Any suggestions? Thanks
  for your help.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Solemnis is based on uncial forms, although slightly more angular than classic
    uncials. It was designed by Gunther Gerhard Lange for Berthold in 1953.
