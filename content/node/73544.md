body: "Hello,\r\nlooking for a fresh pair of eyes, the attached looks very much like
  Univers 67 Bold Condensed with a stroke added, when I overlay it in Illustrator
  the only bits that fail to match are the start C. While I can amend this I's just
  like ot know if its an alternate cut of Univers or something else.\r\nCheers\r\nMartin\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tutto-Logo_6168.jpg]"
