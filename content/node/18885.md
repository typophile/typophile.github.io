body: I was just wondering if anyone could let me know the easiest way to track down
  a certain font.  For example, you find a font you love and you want to track it
  down.  What is your next step? Forgive me if this is a dumb question,  Any advice
  would be appreciated. thank you.

    that is the case, give the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/29\">Type ID Board</a>
    a go. All you need to do is to post an image sample of the font you want identified."

    Typophile is always better - people vs machines."
