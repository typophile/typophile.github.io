  body: "Can't find a match and doubt there'll be one. This kind of woodmark is most
    of time hand-drawn or heavily customization of an existing typeface. It loosely
    reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/clearface|Clearface]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/cheltenham|Cheltenham]]
    but that's far from being even close.\r\nIf you need as vector, you'll find it
    [[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/search/logo?search_api_views_fulltext=cruzcampo|here]],
    freely available to download."
