body: I have been using a font called Sign Painter by Compuworks on my mac. Now we
  need to use it on a PC and my TrueType font will not work on the PC. I need to know
  where I can get a PC version of this font or one that looks like it that will work
  on a PC.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/signpainter_4679.jpg]
