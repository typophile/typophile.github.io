body: "I recently picked up the entire Kepler Opticals set, and I was wondering what
  people's opinions of it were. With 168 different fonts, I assume it is safe to refer
  to this as a Super-Sized package?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of uses have you found for it?
  What kind of uses would you possibly consider it for? \r\n\r\nMy initial impression
  of it is that it is \"classy\" like a Modern face, but with a wicked edge. \r\n\r\nMy
  favorite so far is the Light Extended Display.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KeplerLED_5226.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?"

  body: 'If you have or plan to use Utopia, it makes a surprisingly ideal display
    companion to that. Kepler has size variants already, but I don''t always like
    all that flavor in the text sizes. Newspaper or magazine layouts would be nice
    with Utopia as text and Kepler as display. '

  body: We use it as for text/display (paired with The Sans) in a healthcare magazine
    targeted at women 35-50 years old. Kepler isn't a personal favorite of mine, but
    it works well for this purpose.

    is called for) mostly because it's so underused.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
