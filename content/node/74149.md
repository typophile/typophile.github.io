  body: "I imagine it's an eagle since it's an American rather than Phoenician logo.\r\nThe
    type for the website looks like squooshed [[http://www.typography.com/testDriver/index.php?productLineID=100009|Gotham
    Bold]] and the big USAA letters look like [[http://www.fontfont.com/shop/view_product_desc.ep?id=31132|FF
    Quadraat Sans OT Bold]]."
