  of body copy- large images, but smaller type whose legibility is the most important
  thing. I have set up a grid based on some of Brockmann&#39;s teachings in &#34;Grid
  Systems&#34;.  <BR> <BR>I know that his and Bringhurst&#39;s method to construct
  a grid is set up for book spreads, with two adjacent pages. The margins are weighted
  proportonately to look harmonious on side by side pages, and obviously sit off-centered
  on the page.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the question: If you are using a grid for a single
  page layout, how do you create margins that are centered, yet still look as elegant
  and proportionate as the double page grid system? How do you set up your margins
  on a page that is meant to function by itself? I know that there isn&#39;t a magic
  formula for this, but would like to know what dictates your page margins.  <BR>
  <BR>Thanks!!!'

  body: Are you wanting a math equation? If so I am not the right person to answer
    this question. However, I can say that there is an optical center of the page.
    This <a href="http://photography.cicada.com/pdf/opticalcentre.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>
    shows you how to mount a print on a matteboard in the optical center. Perhaps
    you can find someway of translating it for your needs?

  body: Look at Bringhurst&#39;s discussion of musical proportion. Choose a page size
    and text block size that proportionally work the way you want
