  body: "Texas produced Norah Jones, which makes up for a lot.\r\n: )\r\nBtw, at Starbuck's
    I noticed a CD called Little Willies. Which caught my attention because Willy
    is the British euphamism for male private parts. An inspection showed that Norah
    Jones is doing the vocals on this. "

  body: The source image (poster?) seems to be poking fun at itself, as if it's really
    saying "What is wrong with Americans that they've turned the election of their
    <em>President</em> into a pissing contest?" Do you know where it came from/who
    made it?
