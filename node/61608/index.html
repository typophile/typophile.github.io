  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I know the monospaced typeface topic has been done to death, but I think my question is slightly different.

We want to use Courier in our book to distinguish programming code, but were frustrated that you can't distinguish some of the characters very easily. So I created a variation where you can tell apart 1/l, 0/O, and ~/-. All the other characters are the same. (I am surprised that nobody has done this before, but I couldn't find anything.)

What are the rules for using/distributing this? I assume nobody will care if we use it in print, but what about putting it on the web for students to use?

Thanks,
Steve

I'm glad to see someone doing this. I'm not sure what the rules about it are. I'd assume that because it's different in a way that's functionally important, it would count as something different, but I really have no idea.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Andale (and Vera Sans Mono and Menlo, which were our fallback choices) are all fine programmer typefaces, but to my eye they are not as immediately recognizable when set with other captions (and I don't think they look as nice). We want something that is clearly distinct from the sans serif type that we will be using in figures and headings, and the Lucida Grande that we are using to indicate menu items....

We don't have to make it public if that is frowned upon, but I just wan't sure of the rules. Just seems weird if it is banned, since every computer seems to have Courier already.

		<div class="commentbody">You could modify an open source version of Courier, such as the one included with Ghostscript.  Then there is no question about releasing modifications (you just have to follow the license).  The hinting on the Ghostscript font is not as refined (it has Postscript curves), but it should be fine for printing.

By the way, I like your idea of creating distinguishable characters for Courier.  I understand your desire to have a monotype font that is immediately distinguishable from the surrounding text.  Distinguishing Deja Vu Sans Mono from Deja Vu Sans for instance is almost impossible.</div>

Based on sgh's tip, I made a modified version of Nimbus Mono (the Ghostscript/URW version of Courier). 
I am not a typographer, so I'm sure there are glitches and no-nos, but I think it will work for our purposes...

		<div class="commentbody">I've been on a Courier kick lately after using Vera Sans Mono for several years. The first thing I did was to make a modified version like you did. I used "Courier 10 Pitch" -- its thicker lines are easier on my eyes. I always have to remind myself of which versions of Courier are freely modifiable: Courier 10 Pitch and Nimbus Sans Mono have licenses that allow this, but the version of IBM Courier that ships with X seems to only allow free redistribution, but doesn't mention modification.</div>

The funny thing about Courier 10 Point is that the tilde always showed up as a straight line in my terminal. I finally figured out that I had to remove the hinting (and tweak it a bit) in order to get it to look right.

I think the lower-case "l" needs some work, but that's my preferred way to make it recognizable.</div>
