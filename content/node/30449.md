  advice and your help.\r\nI wanted a Didone font that I could use in my PhD thesis
  which has to be double spaced.\r\nI could not find it. So I set out to design one,
  based on a 1930s Hachette book that I have. I chose a very high x-height to fill
  the page, and a very vertical and symetrical design. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you
  think. I shall be eternally grateful.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "It looks good, at first glance. However, I wouldn't think this as a text
    face, to be honest. The contrast between the strokes is so large. And the thinnest
    strokes are quite thin, almost gets eaten away by the white of the page.\r\nSo
    I think it could use some tweaking here and there."

  body: I agree; it looks good, but with strokes too thin. All your alphabet seems
    to work pretty well, except probably the s, where the problem is the rightmost
    spot, where the thick flows into thin. Too angular. Also, M too thin and S too
    wide. Your numbers don't flow as well as the alphabet. Especially compare your
    9 and 6 to your zero, which looks better. 3 and 2 are stilted; 4 too bold. Also,
    I think your question mark ought to be wider, as well as the ampersand. Euro too
    bold, yen could go with two lines just as well. Your mathematical operators are
    too weird; in type, normalcy is often a virtue. The tildes in the approximation
    sign are annoyingly asymetrical. Also, I don't understand your single-quote scheme--why
    isn't the left one like the corresponding double quote? The font, though, besides
    this stuff, is very interesting, especially with the finial-less finials, and
    the straight y, and I like it.

    body: "> I agree; it looks good, but with strokes too thin. \r\n\r\nI have thought
      about making it with slightly less contrast. On the other hand, I believe that
      it's the high contrast that gives Didone their elegance. So the balance is rather
      difficult to strike. Most nineteenth century french books I have come across
      are also using this high contrast, if not higher.\r\n\r\nI agree with the comments
      on the lower case 's', the numbers and mathematical operators which I have not
      given enough thought too yet.\r\n\r\nFinial-less finials is indeed one of the
      ideas behind this font and it took me hours and hours of tests to find something
      that worked."

  body: "Had a moment to check the specimen out a bit more closely.\r\nI think your
    numerals are a bit.. weird all toghether, exept from the zero, 1, 5 and 8. I agree
    on the 's' part, odd curves. Openings need to be larger and rounder. Like in the
    uppercase version.\r\nI'm not sure about the Registered and Copyright signs, that
    they are in an O or an extended zero. But it might work. Grave and acute signs
    are not too recognizable, maybe make a bit more slanted? The Euro sign too bold.
    Question mark too small.\r\nAnd some of your curves are bumpy, like the ampersand
    and the section character, for example. \r\nBut my curves are off a bit as well
    sometimes, so I won't say too much about that.\r\n\r\nI like the general shapes
    of the alphabet though. Like the lc y and a. \r\nIt just needs a bit more love.

      letters that it took me most time to design.\r\nDo you think there are bumps
      in the letters? I thought I had smoothed out the characters. I shan't need the
      non-letter characters and that's why I have not polished them enough (yet)."

  body: "This is pretty cool. Just a few suggestions:\r\n\r\nThe serifs on your lc
    's' are out of place with every other lc letter. I'd recommend using a solution
    similar to your lc 'c' for this.\r\n\r\nThe bracketed slabs in the UC look a little
    too thick compared to the non-bracketed ones. You should thin them very slightly
    to make up for the extra ink in the bracket.\r\n\r\nLike the others have said,
    you should take a look at a lot of your curves and make them a little smoother.\r\n\r\nI
    love the Registered and Copyright signs. They match the font well, and if someone
    using the font doesn't like them, they can substitute the good old Franklin-Gothic-in-a-circle
    variety. My only suggestion is to make them a little smaller.\r\n\r\nKeep posting
    your progress.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I must agree with quincunx regarding his observations on your font's contrast.
    If you aspire to use this font for the composition of legible text you may consider
    making the contrast somewhat less extreme, at least for body sizes. It would be
    nice if your italics were true italics and not just a slanted roman. I also found
    your puntuation to be a bit on the thin side. It might be worth spending some
    time to differentiate your apostrophes and quotation marks because they look a
    bit like the generic quotes many typographers love to hate.\r\n\r\nOn the plus
    side the overall design seems quite fresh and has a nice rhythm to it. Congrats
    for an interesting first effort."

  body: "Just a couple of quick comments...\r\n\r\nThe '\xE5' is almost unrecognizable
    with a much too small ring. Even if you decide to leave the thickness of the thins
    as is, you should make the ring much larger than a hollowed-out period.\r\n\r\nThe
    curve in the 'f' is a little abrupt at first glance."
