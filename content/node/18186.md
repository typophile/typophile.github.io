  body: "Well, I've hunted almost everywhre I can think to look, and I couldn't do
    any better than to find two pretty similar fonts: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/classic/classic/\"
    target=\"new\">Classic</a> from Classic Fonts, and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/classic/copper/\"
    target=\"new\">Copper</a>, from the same foundry. The ascenders on Classic are
    most like the sample; the Initials of Copper are somewhat closer, although the
    Bernhard Script suggestion has better matching initials (but a non-connected script).\r\n\r\nI
    would not be surprised if this was a custom font done by this foundry for the
    bridal magazine, because the weight and style is so similar, and unlike almost
    any other fonts I saw. I went through all MyFonts and Veer scripts, plus my own
    Script Guide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

      another sample. I've emailed the magazine and hope I get an answer. I appreciate
      the research you went through Mike; I had already done the same. I'm still looking
      for this; as I really want to use it for my own invite.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nGlenda"

  body: I just saw this same font (I think) in a Visa ad. Not that this helps. But
    it suggests that it isn't custom at least.

  body: "I was just incorporating some new Script Guide samples from Paul D. Hunt,
    and something looked very familiar. See <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg5.html\"
    target=\"new\">OttumHmk</a> from the Hallmark font set. This font's lower case
    and even its '?' match most of these letters (note the 'z' also). The 'b' , 'r'
    and 's' are different, but I noticed a strong resemblance between Ottum and Snell
    Roundhand. There's the same (or very similar) 'b' to this script. \r\n\r\nSo where
    does this leave us? The Hallmark artist (Rob Leuschke?) who did Ottum might be
    the one who designed this font for the bride magazine (and Visa ad Patty saw).
    Not to be too critical, but the number of aspects that seem 'borrowed' (Bernhard
    & Snell to name two), takes away from the originality, except that this combination
    is new.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
