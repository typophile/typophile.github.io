  which mimics the attached photo? I want to add a monogram of BM to a design and
  it has to look like it is thread sewn, and failing getting one actually made I am
  stuck.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be hugely appreciated.\r\n\r\nDoj."

    bet is probably treat the letters yourself, though."

    ones) dotted letter outlines in Photoshop, then some emboss filter or effect?

    with a pen tool. Then you can do all kinds of crazy gradient/bevel/shadow/embossing

    upscale look you are going for. It is called Base 05, available at dafont.  http://www.dafont.com/base-05.font\r\n"

  body: "Embroidery softwares usually have a preview option that simulates the thread
    on fabric. You could get someone to digitize what you want and then export an
    image file.\r\nThe software I use is [[http://www.wilcom.com.au/PRODUCTS/TrueSizer.aspx|Wilcom]],
    but its preview is anything but realistic.\r\n[[http://www.grupo-deco.com.mx/images/drawings_x3.jpg|Corel
    DRAWings]] looks much better, but I have no experience with it.\r\nThat being
    said, bear in mind that no software renders a perfect preview.\r\n\r\nHenrique"
