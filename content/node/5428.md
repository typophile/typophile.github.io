  body: looks very crisp, clean and refreshing to me. the only think that troubles
    me &#40;and i&#39;m nitpicking here&#41; is that the arm on the k seems a bit
    stubby. very nice work!

  body: Hi Andrew, this is nice. I think the longer arm on the k is an improvement.
    I like the figures and the @ sign a lot. <BR> <BR>&#60;nitpicking&#62;The top
    of the &#39;s&#39; seems a little squished to me. Maybe it goes too far to the
    right?&#60;/nitpicking&#62; <BR> <BR>It&#39;s nice and bright. Bitley is a good
    name.
