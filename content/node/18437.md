    guy pored over specimen books 12 hours a day to keep his chops.

  body: "Nope... Yves did not slip any ID skillz.\r\n\r\nYes, it is Packard (Bold)
    and the cap S is dead nuts to the original specimens that Compugraphic revived
    (in phototype) from T.J. Lyons' archive of antique types. Later I believe it had
    to be \"retired\" from the library since I don't see it anywhere now... but in
    my old CG specimen book it's as plain as day."

  body: "It's proved a little difficult finding a quality image of pre-1920 Packard
    Automobile ads, but here is one from 1918.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Packard-ad1.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    once read about the great care that Packard Automobiles took in building their
    advertising image, but I can't find any sources at the moment. Just thought it
    was interesting to share. I have seen earlier ads where the face looked closer
    to what we know as Packard Antique or Packhard. \r\n\r\nIn the old Compugraphic
    specimen book I have, there are two weights of Packard, the lighter is similar
    to the weight in the auto ad. If someone has a ready reference on the designer
    and origin of the face, it would be nice to add to this thread."
