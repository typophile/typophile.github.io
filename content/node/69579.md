    as the body?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSimon"

  body: "No, I personally don't like much Trebuchet for body text (too \"fat\"). For
    text I think you could use the \"classic\" Helvetica/Arial stack, or even a serif
    one.\r\nI meant Trebuchet for headers."

  body: "Well, of course it depends on the content and style of the website, if there
    are other places (stationery, etc.) where the logo will be paired with other typefaces,
    and so on.\r\nFirst thing you should determine is if you want Calibri just for
    the logo or as \"corporate face\" (pull-out, etc.).\r\nYou could also try to define
    it in CSS, but the problem is that it's pretty small compared to most other fallback
    fonts."

  body: "Yes Calibri for as you say (corporate font). In terms of style of the site,
    Im trying to create a  clean professional feel (colours black, white, magenta)
    black/dark grey background with white/off white content area. Headers/Focal Points
    in Magenta, so will stand out quite a lot anyway, so I dont want a type that is
    too heavy really or the over use of magenta could become too much. \r\n\r\nDo
    you think I could use a slab serif type for headers and it look right with Calibri
    as the logo type font?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you want to use a slab, you will need images/SIFR or more modern solutions.\r\nThen,
    I would suggest a slab from Luc(as) De Groot."
