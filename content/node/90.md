  Would it be nice to have a &#34;Classified Ads&#34;  <BR>section in Typophile? People
  could offer their fonts for  <BR>licensing - it could even become an alternative
  to  <BR>submitting to a font house: font houses would come  <BR>here to see what&#39;s
  for &#34;sale&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Or maybe make it a subsection of the Critique forum:  <BR>finished
  faces could get an announcement there, citing  <BR>the intentions of the designer.
  I think the News section  <BR>wouldn&#39;t really work for this type of thing.&#34;
  <BR> <BR>A simple discussion of licensing options and houses  <BR>would be of great
  help to new designers. <BR> <BR>Stephen '

    about, and it will most likely go live just as soon as the new forums software
    gets released &#40;This is v3.10, 4.0 is currently in Beta&#41;. The new forum
    will allow for greater privacy and entitlement, allowing a richer level of interaction.
    That&#39;s really all I can say right now without letting the cat out of the bag. '
