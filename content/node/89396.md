body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI would like to know which typeface this is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whatfont_4266.jpg]\r\n\r\n(Bigger
  versions <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/dolcepress/6021367521/in/photostream/\">here</a>)\r\n\r\nIt's
  both the all caps and the numbers I'm after; not sure if they're the same font though.
  My gut says the G and the Y in the gold text are stylistic alts, but they could
  have been altered by the designer.\r\n\r\nActually, any suggestions for a similar,
  non-geometric font (i.e. not like Avant Garde or Futura) with a round G like that
  would be welcome. I found these so far, but they're not quite what I'm looking for
  (yes, I'm picky):\r\n\r\nCalibre by Klim\r\nVerlag (w/ alternate G) by HFJ\r\nNeutraface
  2 by House Industries\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nR."

  body: You can also try <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ars_type/ars_maquette_complete_ot/">ARS
    Maquette</a> which has a truckload of surprising alternates, though not the ones
    you are looking for.

  body: Surprisingly so, with 1195 glyphs! But really it's more the proportions and
    the spurless, roundish G that I like in the sample. And the fact that the center
    of the M doesn't touch the baseline. Still not quite there, but much appreciated!

  body: And of course there are alternates in/different cuts of Proxima Nova with
    a round G. But who can identify the typeface(s?) in the image above?

    free to download! And yes, it has an alternate G and an alternate Y, plus the
    curvy sevens and all. Thanks for the suggestions for alternatives!\r\n\r\nMoved
    and marked as solved."
