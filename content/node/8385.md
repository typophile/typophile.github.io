  body: i love this! it&#39;s so quirky. i like how the straights are all nice and
    even and the curves are all kind of wonky. just one thing i noticed in glancing
    over this rea quick was that the left leg of the A is too dark, other than that,
    i&#39;m curious to see how the final product turns out.

  body: Paul, thanks. <BR>Hrant, what do you mean &#34;undesigned&#34;? Inconsistently
    designed, or just poorly designed I would understand, but I&#39;m not sure what
    &#34;undesigned&#34; means. <BR> <BR>I find it surprisingly legible at 11pt, on
    paper, anyway. <BR> <BR>I need to finish the numbers soon so I can present a complete
    font.

  body: I guess &#34;undesigned&#34; means that the features typical of a &#34;refined&#34;
    text face are missing. Like how the &#34;e&#34; is so choppy and totally different
    than the &#34;o&#34;, etc. That couldn&#39;t be unintentional on you part &#40;right?&#41;
    but the cool thing is that it looks it, which is hard to pull off I think. <BR>

  body: Is this &#34;undesigned&#34; aspect why only two people have offered criticism?
    I know the face is very rough, but I&#39;m not certain what specifically needs
    changing. the &#34;a&#34; needs to be a tad thicker on the right of the counter
    at the top, the &#34;g&#34; as well. The &#34;A&#34; is thick on the left. These
    I can see &#40;having printed the sample &#40;11pt&#41; also, the bowl of the
    lc &#34;p&#34; needs to touch the baseline and the x-hight is too much. Agree,
    disagree? The S needs to be smoother, too, I think.

    to crit. On the other hand, this type of thing might also be less popular [these
    days]. Dunno. Don&#39;t let any of this discourage you too much though! We don&#39;t

    as you say, that it can be improved in simple ways. <BR> <BR>The uppercase E,
    L and F are too wide for the structure of the face.  <BR> <BR>The uppercase bowls

  body: Also forgot to mention that the lower case k looks a bit narrow and that the
    bowls of b, d, p and q have the same problem of the bowls of the P and R, they
    are too similar for the character of the face.

  body: Noah, I think a study of <a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/index.htm" target="_blank">briem&#39;s
    guide</a> to type would be helpful to you. He explains there how the curved strokes
    need to be thicker than the stems in order to look the same and other things,
    these tricks will enable you to keep your playful shapes, but make the face more
    balanced and polished. For example, the vertical part of your bowls on bcd need
    to be thicker to balance the stems.  <BR> <BR>Also you might have a look at <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-tempus/" target="_blank">Tempus</a>
    and other Grimshaw fonts to see how he is able to make informal faces very balanced
    but still lively.

  body: Honestly, these letterforms look completely arbitrary to me. Briem&#39;s guide
    &#40;especially <a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.4a/2.3.4.01.exercise1.htm">
    this part</a>&#41;, to which William posted a link, is almost the extreme opposite
    of your project, so I think it can be a good reference. <BR> <BR>Anyway, if you
    really really want to go the &#39;naive&#39; way, I&#39;d suggest you to apply
    randomness to all details in your font. The accented characters, for example,
    they shouldn&#39;t be the same base character with the diacritics on top of it.

  body: Thanks gang, I&#39;ve put this face to bed for now while I try my hand at
    a more formal face to get a better understanding of the nuance of fonts. Nothing
    &#40;or, almost nothing&#41; was arbitrary, but a lot of the considerations now
    strike me as idiotic. I would really love more feedback on nsfBook. <BR>Frimbo
    will be revived as a display face some day.
