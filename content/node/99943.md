  some serious typographic assistance!  I'm preparing a handout (attached) for an
  important job talk I'm giving and I desperately want it to look professional.  \r\n\r\nThe
  main body font must be small (like 9pt) to prevent lines of poetry from running
  off the page; and has to either come with MS Word 2010 or be inexpensive ($35 or
  less.)  :(  Also, some of the handout is in Greek, so I need a unicode font that
  will look ok with the Goudy\r\n\r\nI chose Goudy Old Style for the Latin because
  it seemed old-fashioned (good for my audience of Classics scholars) and on my screen
  I thought it looked more readable than, say, Baskerville OF at that size.  I keep
  switching between Palatino Linotype and Gentium for the Greek.  Then Bodoni MT for
  the headings...is this like a rookie combining-serifs mistake? I think all the fonts
  should have serifs because I'm trying to keep it sort of old school , but wasn't
  satisfied with the way GOS looked in the headings. \r\n\r\nAnyway, your suggestions
  would be so much appreciated!!  Thanks in advance!"

    something look amateurish. While it is possible, start with that thought, and
    if you're not sure about something, assume you're making a mistake.\r\n\r\nAs
    the alphabets are different, it is possible to use a <cite>somewhat</cite> different
    Greek and Latin font & still have harmony. But watch out for headings that don't
    fit.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there are more free fonts for polytonic Greek from The
    Greek Font Society:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces1.html\r\n\r\nNot
    the best, but then, neither is Gentium. For what it's worth, GFS Olga is a pretty
    good font, but it is offered as an an inclined only.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nIn the
    world I live in -- scholarly books -- Goudy Old Style is reminiscent of Alumni
    magazines and other slick magazines aimed at people with more money than taste.
    While your mileage may vary, consider where you've seen Goudy Old Style used.
    Goudy is a Venetian, sort of, kind of. There are many better, of which Espinosa
    Nova is one. I mention it because just now the Roman is free, leaving you with
    a $50 purchase for the italic. I realize that does exceed you budget a bit.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/estudio-ch/espinosa-nova/
    \r\n\r\nThere is a GFS font (Greek) that matches it reasonably well -- if you're
    interested, reply so & when I get to work tomorrow, I'll look it up.\r\n\r\n*
    * *\r\n\r\nIt would appear you've got the Linotype Palatino that comes with polytonic
    Greek? Palatino is somewhat out of favor these days, but the OpenType version
    has all the characters and weights you need, and is still reasonably well respected.
    The fact that Palatino has been used a lot is probably the major reason it is
    out of favor. Designer boredom is not your problem, money is. If it were me &
    I had your budgetary constraints, I'd used it for all the text.\r\n\r\nAdobe's
    Arno came free with some Adobe software; if you have it, it might serve your needs
    very well.  Arno also has all the characters and weights you need. It is well
    outside your budget if you have to buy it, though.\r\n\r\n& BTW, a setting size
    of 9-point Palatino is about the same as 10-something Arno. Point size itself
    isn't too meaningful these days. Fit your copy if that's a requirement, while
    balancing the apparent size. You probably knew that...\r\n\r\nGood luck with it."

  body: As to free fonts, you can try Andron and Cardo (http://www.mufi.info/fonts/).
    I'd prefer the new Brill font (http://www.brill.com/author-gateway/brill-fonts).
    Minion and Myriad come with Adobe Reader and might suit you well (after you install
    go to the installed folder under "resources - fonts".)

    these resources for years to come.   I like your suggestion of Arno, Charles...although
    funny you should say that about Goudy Old Style: my favorite magazine does in
    fact use it, which, if you're right, would put me in serious taste debt.  Will
    play around a bit.\r\n\r\nAgain, I do appreciate your help!"
