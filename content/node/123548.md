body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m doing a branding project for my school\u2019s library,
  and admins wanted a typeface that doesn\u2019t evoke academia, or suggest anything
  about teaching, expertise, tradition, poise or authority. So Venetian and Garalde
  are immediately off the list. Also don\u2019t want to use French modern or Scotch
  Roman (too delicate, too Vogue-like).\r\n\r\nThis is a body typeface that will be
  paired by an either softened Neo-Grotesk or a humanist sans. I\u2019m a bit out
  of ideas: what kind of serif performs well in long-form text while does not have
  too much calligraphic reminiscence to be considered classy? I proposed Lyon, which
  is already non-traditional enough (Noordzij style very obvious though) but still
  got rejected. Do I have to go with a slab?"

  body: There's a lot about what they want it to NOT be, but you don't have a direction
    until you know what they DO want it to be. From the context, my chips are on "fun",
    in which case you are probably going to have to go well outside the realm of what
    are conventionally considered text faces before you have something unsubtle enough
    to be approved. Start with humanist slabs, and if you're very lucky, you won't
    be picking among casual comic hands in the end.

    It's just a tad more slab-ish, but it shares so much of the versatile but playful
    characteristics of the others I didn't want to leave it out."

    PT Serif or Liberation Serif or even Luxi Serif at them.

  body: "A classic slab-serif like Cairo or Memphis or Stymie certainly is suitable
    for extended text in a pinch.\r\n\r\nObviously, you don't want to use Comic Sans;
    not only isn't it a serif typeface, but it's badly overused.\r\n\r\nIs it possible
    you might be able to get away with Century Expanded or Goudy Old Style... or Corona,
    or Ionic No. 5? Textype, based on Century Expanded, and available from Bitstream
    as Century 731, doesn't seem too authoritarian in appearance."

  body: "Ok, I forgot this one. Here is a citation from <a href=\"http://www.readcentral.com/chapters/Charles-A-Murdock/A-Backward-Glance-at-Eighty/011\">A
    Backward Glance at Eighty</a> by Charles Murdock\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n In my
    publications I followed a somewhat severe style of typography, especially priding
    myself on the possession of a complete series of genuine old-style faces cast
    in Philadelphia from moulds cut a hundred and seventy years ago. In these latter
    days a few bold men have tried to improve on this classic. One Ronaldson especially
    departed from the simplicity and dignity of the cut approved by Caxton, Aldus,
    and Elz\xE9vir, and substituted for the beautiful terminal of, say the capital
    T, two ridiculous curled points. I resented it passionately, and frequently remarked
    that a printer who would use Ronaldson old-style would not hesitate to eat his
    pie with a knife. \r\n</blockquote>\r\nGiven the specs, that would, I guess, justify
    using <a href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/\">Ronaldson</a>.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, Ronaldson was used for textbooks at least here in Quebec at the beginning
    of the twentieth century."
