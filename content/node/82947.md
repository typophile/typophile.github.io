body: "I think I have got to a point with Css where I can build anything I or someone
  else have designed, my codes validates and also work in older versions of IE.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I can't help thinking that I'm still not there yet because my codes doesn't look
  the same as my web designer collegues. Their codes have a lot of '!important' and
  '-moz' and they use z-index and mainly position elements. I've never used !important
  and -moz and z-index in my codes (never had to) and I tend to float most things
  which they've already told me I shouldn't do.\r\n\r\nThe books I've read haven't
  taught me the above. Should I be coding like how they are? I would like to get really
  advanced at CSS. \r\n\r\nSo what advanced books out there should I be looking at
  reading? I'd like something quite new that also has a small snippet of Css3 but
  I want the focus to be Css2.1. \r\n\r\nThis book looks like it's inline with what
  I'm looking for Smashing CSS: Professional Techniques for Modern Layout - Eric Meyers\r\n\r\nAnyone
  read it? Can anyone recommend anything else?\r\n\r\nP.s - I have read CSS Mastery
  - I'd like something even more advanced."

  body: "There's good CSS and bad CSS. It sounds a lot like you've found the path
    to good CSS. Don't feel like you have to emulate the hacks and workarounds of
    your colleagues. If you're getting good feedback from clients, back-end developers,
    and users, and your code works on the browsers it needs to, then you're doing
    great.\r\n\r\n--John"

  body: "Most of time, having lots of <code>!important</code> declarations indicate
    a poor understanding of the cascade. But of course, it can  <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#important-rules\">be
    used in an appropriate way</a>, too.\r\n\r\nThe <code>z-index</code> comes with
    positioned \u2013 and stacked/overlapping \u2013 elements. It depends on your
    design ideas and intentions whether you need it or not. You sure can do splendid
    things without it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/03/css_vendor_pref_1.html\">Vendor-specific
    prefixes</a> like <code>-moz</code> can be used to serve declarations that haven\u2019t
    been standardized (yet) to certain browsers that already understand them."
