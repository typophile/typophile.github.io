  has released a new font manager, Suitcase Fusion. It incorporates some of the most
  popular features from both the Font Reserve and Suitcase font managers. In particular,
  it uses FontSense technology for auto-activation to distinguish between Postscript
  name duplicates. It also supports face-level activation of Macintosh font suitcases.
  \r\n\r\nThere is also an flash animation on the main Extensis page showing the products
  being \"fused\".\r\nhttp://www.extensis.com\r\n\r\n"

    like that last several updated versions. I want added features for my font management
    needs! (Stupid PC only company I work for is afraid to get me a Mac!)  '

  body: "You may have noticed this thread recently on a similar topic.\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/12563\r\n\r\nOther
    font managers for Windows, such as Suitcase 9.2 haven't been updated recently.
    This is partly because a new version of Windows hasn't been released in several
    years. Also, Windows doesn't really provide a mechanism to make system-wide font
    auto-activation possible. On the Mac this is handled by a specific process called
    ATS server. I'm hoping that Microsoft makes something like ATS functionality possible
    in Vista.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible that plug-in based font auto-activation will
    emerge under Windows. Currently, Suitcase Fusion's plug-in based auto-activation
    is much more sophisticated in terms of figuring out what font was used in a particular
    document. It would be useful for Windows users to have access to that functionality
    as well. "

  body: "Is that the only reason there aren't new versions of suitcase for Windows?
    What about version updates, like 9.3? I recently used Font Expert 2005 and it
    seemed to have quite alot of features that Suitcase 9.2.1 doesn't. It probably
    would have been a superior product if they could have simplified it abit (user-interface
    is confusing, even though it is re-arrangeable). \r\n\r\nWhat keeps me coming
    back to Suitcase is just that, it's simple. I have a pretty organized file/folder
    system already in place and with Suitcase all I have to do is Drag and Drop. Font
    Expert 2005 doesn't make that process easy, plus if you're not careful you can
    easily delete font files.\r\n\r\nI apologize if I sound like a nag Carl, you're
    a good guy. I think I just ran into more font issues than I was comfortable with
    and now I'm all out of sorts... I need to get back to the Mac!  "

  body: "I tried out FontExpert and totally agree with your assesment of the user
    interface. It's really \"busy\". However, I really like character table view and
    the properties pane. It's seems like it's aimed at people who know how fonts work
    and want be able to see the details. It would be cool if there was a way to open
    the font in FontLab from within FontExpert. \r\nIMHO, it's too bad that all of
    the details are exposed by default; some users might feel overwhelmed by details.
    \r\nAlso, it seems like it's very file oriented, if that means anything. You pick
    font files and then install them.  Is there a way to create sets? There's a thing
    called a Worklist, but I'm not sure how to make more than one. "

  body: 'Actually it works off the Windows File System. You work directly with the
    font file/folders... it doesn''t however allow you to attach multiple font files
    just by selecting the root folder (you actually need to go thru every subfolder
    and select the fonts, very time consuming and tedious.) Another problem is if
    you fail to create a "duplicate/shortcut" of the font file and attach it to the
    worklist (a working list of fonts for the instance) you could easily delete that
    font when you deactivate it. It''s abit more involved than the simplistic layout
    of Suitcase. I love that I can drag and drop a folder and all the subfolders are
    searched to include any fonts within, Font Expert 2005 doesn''t do that. I love
    that you can activate and deactivate fonts on the fly, Font Expert 2005 doesn''t
    do that, easily. But, like you said Font Expert does have some benefits, especially
    if you''re a type designer. '
