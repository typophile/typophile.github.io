  this great typeface that I wonder if anyone can i.d. for me. below are lots of examples.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g1_5017.png]\r\n(I
  love the innuendo of that one!)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g2_4930.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g3_5215.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g4_4170.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/g5_3479.png]\r\n\r\nIn
  the print ad, I could see that the face has rough edges (not so easy to see at 72ppi).
  I'm much more interested in the letterforms themselves, so if anyone knows comparable
  faces without the rough edges, please advise.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    Condensed</a>. And: you really don\u2019t need misleading thread titles to attract
    attention on this board.\r\nF\r\n\r\nedit: Now I see the \u2018warts\u2019 are
    part of the text \u2013 so, they\u2019re not 100% OT. Sorry, didn\u2019t read,
    just looked at the letters."

    Olive</a>: it also has short descenders, a straight \u2018R\u2019 leg, narrow
    \u2018c\u2019, double-storey \u2018a\u2019 and single-storey \u2018g\u2019."

  body: "Thanks, everyone! And thank you, Florian, for your honest catch! \r\n\r\nFor
    some reason, Antique Olive has never appealed to me. I think it's the comparatively
    light joining of the bowls to stems, and the like. Granted, this is one of the
    defining characteristics...\r\n\r\nHermes is pretty hot. I wish the heavier weights
    didn't have as much stroke contrast, but that Thin weight is nice!"
