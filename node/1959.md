body: I&#39;m a student in a graphic design class at school and my teacher gave us
  a challenge to figure out what font this letter is in.  It&#39;s been 2 months now
  and no one has figured it out.  I came across this website which looks like the
  people know their stuff, so i thought I&#39;d try.  I only have ONE letter unfortunately.  i
  guessed Centaur, but he said it was wrong.  o yea, he wants the designer too.  thanks
  for any help.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19868.jpg" alt="font">

    border=0> <BR>It&#39;s a shame your pic is blurry. Centaur&#39;s a very good guess.

    top of the ascender...

    some old metal version for display use? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll check our samples...

  body: It looks surprisingly like Centaur.  Could it be that your teacher just knows
    it by another name?  It has several; try with Venetian301.

  body: it&#39;s blurry because it was actually mirrored on our syllabus and I took
    a pic of it and reversed it and blew it up.  thanks for the responses, i&#39;ll
    try Venetian301 today when I go to class.  I took an h from centaur, blew it up
    to the same size and put them over each other they matched perfectly, so I was
    shocked when he said I was wrong, but hopefully Venetian works.  And it&#39;s
    not cheating, it&#39;s using all available resources :-&#41;

    <BR>Fair enough, that counts in my book. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
    border=0> I was just  <BR>pulling yer leg. <BR> <BR>Frankly Dave, if this is not
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/centaur/mt/testdrive.html?s=h&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> Centaur</a>, then I&#39;m REALLY  <BR>curious what it is supposed
    to be. I did a tiny bit of  <BR>looking up and all the signs tell me it&#39;s
    Centaur.  <BR>Especially the ascender that widens at the top just  <BR>underneath
    the serif is a tell-tale feature. <BR> <BR>If your teacher sez it&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/venetian-301/venetian-301/testdrive.html?s=h&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> Venetian 301</a>, then you are  <BR>entitled to have a good laff
    at his expense, because  <BR>that basically IS Centaur, only the Bitstream version  <BR>which
    <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14101.html#POST24463" target="_blank">
    they renamed to avoid having to pay royalties</a>  <BR>to Monotype. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    dig a bit deeper in the meantime. Yaneverknow... <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s some extra
    info: <BR><i>A refinement of Roman inscriptional capitals designed  <BR>by Bruce
    Rogers as a titling design for signage in the  <BR>Metropolitan Museum. Rogers

    anything but Centaur. <BR> <BR>I know it&#39;s also named Venetian301, but anyone
    else know any other names?  The teacher may not know the same font&#39;s called
    a few different things, especially if he&#39;s more into graphic design than fonts.
    <BR> <BR>&#62;<i>but im on the right track...</i> <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s also
    known as Venetian something-else?  Just a different number?

    Lawson&#39;s <i>Anatomy</i>, the various sizes of caps were called &#39;Metropolitan

  body: It is very close to Requiem, specifically to the Text Roman, but not identical.
    Requiem has more of an arched curve, starting lower down the stem, and the bracketing
    of the serifs is not so heavy as in Dave&#39;s sample. And the beak of the ascender
    in Requiem points slightly down, while Dave&#39;s sample seems to angle slightly
    up.

  body: Dave, <BR> <BR>There is serious hair splitting going on here over the angle
    of serifs, thickness of bracketing, curvature of branches. Could you do a big
    old scan rather than taking a photo. The blurring is dibilitating at this level
    of detail. It also might give some clues as to it&#39;s origin &#40;ie. is it
    digital, or is it a scan of a metal face?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Randy
