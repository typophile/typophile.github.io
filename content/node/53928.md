    standard of characters. Sadly.\r\n\r\nI heartily recommend this article of David
    B. I have already printed the article out (with Adam Twardoch's comment!) to put
    into a binder for further, offline reference and note taking. <strong>This is
    something that I almost never, ever do.</strong> I recommend that everyone do
    the same, right now.\r\n"
