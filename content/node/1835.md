    My best advice is to just play around with it.. Try tracing some letters, etc. '

  body: I was having a hard time getting the hang of the bezier--especially the click
    and drag. Then, I came upon a section in my Sam&#39;s 24-hour book on Illustrator
    that dealt with this with a couple of exercises. By golly, I had an aha! moment!
    I can do beziers!--and with more practice, I&#39;ll be able to do them well. <BR>

  body: The way I learned Beziers, was to set myself a small project...that&#39;s
    just cause I just never seem to sit on my desk with a book and follow instructions.
    Instead I downloaded a cartoon still--Stimpy--off the wed and drew over it in
    Illustrator. Btw. cartoons work best bec. they temd to have a lot of flat colour.  <BR>
    <BR>It only took about an hour and it really helped me to figure illustrator out
    for myself. Plus Stimpy freaking ROCKS.
