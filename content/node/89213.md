  no success. I don't think I am doing anything wrong and I've done it several other
  times... any idea?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    you can upload your image to another image hosting service (there are many) and
    use the IMG tags to link it in.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The Image Upload function usually works for most people if the file size
    is less than 130K. As Jared says, this restrictive size limitation is a known
    glitch that the Punchcut guys have been working to resolve.\r\n\r\nIf your file
    size is less than 130K and it still doesn\u2019t work, then you can use the html
    &lt;img&gt; tag as Jared suggests. "
