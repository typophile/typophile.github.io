I was inspired by Evert Bloemsma's Avance to build a font with severely asymmetrical serifs. In the spirit of not wandering aimlessly, my goal is to make a font with which I can set papers for my college courses. <br> <br>At the moment, I've completed the lower and upper case basic alphabet. I want to reorient myself now before I embark on the full character set. I have a few concerns: <br> <br>1 The character spacing seems wrong. Maybe it's too tight? <br>2 Some characters (<b>e</b>, <b>s</b>, etc...) seem too dark. Maybe this is caused by the spacing? <br>3 The character spacing for upper case only works when preceding lower case. Is it normal to have 26x26 kerning pairs to make all upper case text look alright? <br>4 Some of my glyph shapes (<b>d</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>k</b>, <b>q</b>) may be too crazy for a typeface intended for continuous text. Should I cave in an conventionalize them? (I refuse to budge on <b>Q</b>; the tail stays) <br>5 The bowls in <b>b</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>p</b>, and <b>q</b> may be too large. <br>6 My upper case forms are rough because I have less practice drawing them. Any ideas for improvement? <br> <br>I may be overlooking far larger problems here. If so, please set me straight! Assistance will save me trouble down the road and will be tremendously appreciated.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>The character spacing seems wrong. Maybe it's too tight?</i> <br> <br>I think it's just right. Many modern faces are too loose. <br> <br><i>Some of my glyph shapes (d, g, k, q) may be too crazy for a typeface intended for continuous text. The bowls in b, d, p, and q may be too large.</i> <br> <br>Naw, they're not too crazy. I think the biggest problem is <br>the bowl of the 'g' is too small in comparison to the others <br>which are lovely.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Actually I think your spacing is in fact too tight overall. However: <br>1. It seems that some areas (like the "ven" sequence) are fine, and in fact some are too loose - so it's still too uneven to tell. <br>2. There's no easy way to be sure anyway without a physical printout in the intended medium - probably through lino, right? <br> <br>The "s" is in fact too dark - because of its density it always has to be lighter than you think. <br> <br>> Is it normal to have 26x26 kerning pairs to make all upper case text look alright? <br> <br>No, although I happen to think it's a great idea to use such an exhaustive matrix to loosen all-caps setting. <br> <br>Your "bdpq"... it depends who you ask: some designers will say they are "wrong". But I think they're more than fine. In fact, I've only seen such a wonderful "d" structure one other place - in my Patria... :-> But be careful of getting too attached to individual glyphs: taming overly flamboyant characters can be very painful but is usually necessary. <br> <br>Your main problem right now is the "g" (by far the most difficult character in Latin). Don't let dogma ruin it for you. Some otherwise wonderful designs (like Matrix) really need a much smarter "g". <br> <br>As for your uppercase forms, what I might advise is something I hinted at in the thread about Avance: go orthodox. Those puppies are really gloriously stiff - it's all they got - let them shine in their own way. <br> <br>BTW, your comma is amazing! But do make its tail longer. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Overall, the face reads well. The spacing is just fine. And I <br>love that quirky <b>k</b>. <br> <br>The <b>g</b> seems wormy (weak), although it performs <br>ok in the text sample you show.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Like the commas also. Maybe use the same structure in the quotes. <br> <br>In the text sample the g next to the o adds to its wormy look. IMO it could use more volume in the top and bottom and less in the middle. Maybe the tail could start a bit more left to give it more baseline stress and less like it's floating. <br> <br>Like what you've got going. Also like the name Sanoma.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Haven't had time to work on Sonoma recently, but the weeks ahead look promising. I did have time to find a couple designs that not only have half-serifs, but also have flares for balance. <br> <br><a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/seagull/>Seagull</a>, by Adrian Williams and Bob McGrath, has a design based on handlettering, with asymetrical serifs, where with start of the serif stroke draws the balancing flare. <br> <br><a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sierra/>Sierra</a>, by Kris Holmes, has flares which occupy a greater portion of their side of the stem than Avance or Sonoma, starting to flare about halfway down, and ending closer to vertical.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've been trying to figure out what I like so much about this <br>face. I've decided it's the clunkiness of the serifs combined <br>with the overall inconsistency. It's really alive. I've long <br>loved the clunkyness of slab serifs, but most are a little too <br>mechanical for my liking-- too perfect. This has more <br>vitality. <br> <br>I think it looks great in the setting. I would polish a few <br>characters, but nothing to change the overall feel. And <br>don't even think about taming the k. If you really want to <br>make a font to set a book in, start over. If you want a really <br>funky cool something for small blocks of copy, you're right <br>on. <br> <br>A few suggestions: The spur on the d and the q have got to <br>go. They are awkward, and don't fit the other characters. <br>They imply a line that doesn't line up with anything else. <br>The d could take a cue from the a. I would work on the <br>terminals on the S, the j and the y. The terminals on the C <br>and the G are also a little awkward. The G feels a little <br>heavy. <br> <br>Don't polish too much though. It would be a shame to loose <br>the rough, chunky feel that makes this face so cool.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is going to totally disappoint Christian, but I've radically changed the feel of Sonoma. I dug this heap out of the garage a couple weeks ago and gave it some good polish. But I've learned lots and developed a certain taste since I worked on the poor thing last so a good polish turned into an overhaul. So I present the new Sonoma: <br> <br><a href=http://www.xtypa.com/ext/sonoma/sonomaspec.gif> Um, Click Here</a> (cause image uploading is broken) <br> <br>There is a pdf version of this specimen <a href=http://www.xtypa.com/files/sonomascintillatingspecimen.pdf>over here</a> and if you'd like so see a pdf of the same specimen layout as the old Sonoma but with the updated design, take a look <a href=http://www.xtypa.com/files/sonomaharoldbloom.pdf>over there</a>. Let me know what you think. I like how things are going so far, but I'd like to hear if this looks like a design that people would want to actually use for, you know, a real project. <br> <br>If you're interested in knowing more about this update, there's a bit more detail over on my <a href=http://www.xtypa.com/>type design work blog</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>Here you go Eduardo.

<div class=commentbody>I think of the stressless 0 as being a Gill-y feature, but that's based on gut feel rather than actual knowledge, so I'm probably out to lunch. If you're not going to use that, then I think you ought to make the 0 more ovoid. It really strongly resembles an oversized 'o' right now. <br> <br>I don't think the numerals are too wide. I guess I am kind of curious why the 1's serif structure is different from the letters', though. <br> <br>"Bitey" means the way the two serifs close in on the middle of the 3 makes it look like it's biting itself. It's too closed in, I would say.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree that the figures are wide, and sometimes I think they look too big. <br> <br>One way of solving it is by making the shorter. And smaller, in consequence. This typeface is narrow, so I guess it is appropriate to have narrow figures. <br> <br>In general, I think that typefaces with low x-height are the ones that benefit more from having this kind of "floating" oldstyle figures (figures taller/higher than the x-height). But this is a typeface with a generous x-height, so I think the figures should be closer to the x-height. (But don't align them with the x-height! :-)</div>
