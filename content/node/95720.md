  done by Teucer Wilson.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/castironlettering_4080.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething
  with that broad nib contrast, flairing stems and hand-made feel, yet stability.
  It's for a tombstone, for my friend's brother.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[[http://www.teucerwilson.co.uk/content/images/castironlettering.jpg]]\r\n\r\nFound
  here:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.teucerwilson.co.uk/portfolio/othermaterials/]]\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions greatly appreciated."

    the lines of Optima.\r\nAnd it really bears no resemblance to Jovica's font Hrant,
    other than it is calligraphic."

    reply: he designs his own digital fonts, but they are not for sale -- yet! In
    the meantime, he suggests that you check out...\r\n\r\nEverything by Michael Harvey\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/search/michael%20harvey#b99d745f909bc591c9e01c5ac9b1fde6\r\n

    (as suggested above)\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/645/hermannzapf.html\r\n\r\nHe
    said, \"I also like fonts like Bodoni Roma, Baskerville, Lithos, Baker Signet,
    Black Swan, Clairvaux, Torquemada, Edwardian script, Espresso, Rusticana Roman...
    Trajan, Playbill... I could go on. I guess it\u2019s the design and what you do
    with the letters that makes them interesting, right? Also I tend to refine and
    change when I get to drawing on stone, and carving.\""

  body: Thanks for your inquisitive nature Skylar. It is hard to escape the identity
    of the forms in this particular piece. Zapf's influence is ever present in contemporary
    work no matter how much Hrant is unwilling to admit it. Teucer's work will appear
    in the upcoming Scripsit, DC calligraphers guild. His work there is very much
    a nod to Michael Harvey.

    Veljovi\u0107. In fact the lc \"g\" in my Patria took some cues from the italic
    of his International (even if -like Noordzij- I don't think much of his \u0153uvre).
    But in any case: none of that justifies you behavior.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
