  I've designed it for my 'Invisible Cities' project, where I intend to use it for
  titling, texture, ornament etc. It's designed to work as confusing as a labyrinth
  (and almost invisible), but still be descipherable. What do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Labyrinth03_5142.jpg]\r\n\r\nciao,

    throw a stone into water.

  body: "Wow, this totally bugged out. Awesome!\r\n\r\nReadability?... I'm not sure.
    Obviously, don't use it if legibility is imperative. For artsy projects, ya...
    maybe rework the illegibles, if you do want it readable.\r\n\r\nFor \"V\", I would
    suggest an Avant Garde-ish tilt, with the left stem being vertical. You might
    try vertical stems with \"W\" as well.\r\n\r\n\"I\" should have a contained, non-open
    shape in center.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would say the maze theme is great, but if legibility
    is a priority, on a few letters you should compromise and have some enclosed shapes."

  body: "Thanks for the comments guys!\r\n\r\nYeah, I guess some characters are problematic...
    :) I look into your suggestions. The V idea seems interesting. I guess legibility
    is too much to ask, but descipherability should be possible. It's probably more
    hypnotising than readable though ;)\r\n\r\ngreetings Jeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"
