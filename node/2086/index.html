<div class=commentbody>The second cover is better. <br> <br>The authors name looks better in upper and lower case, and "slaves" looks better as the bold sans. I do like the tighter leading on the first cover though. <br> <br>It's a very good start. And with a picture like that, I'd say you'd want to deemphasise the text and use as little of it as possible.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Miu, you need some dynamics, try this make the photo a negative image, or posterize it. The Image is dull and tell nothing of the story. If you have access to more photos I'd make a montage, the operative word of the title is Slaves. I'd also not justify the authors' name and credit. By not justifying it could create some more tension visually. You might also play with making the title of the book the focal point and make the weak photo small. If you can play with 21st Century Slaves as it reads faster and is more dynamic. Just some thoughts, Dan</div>

<div class=commentbody>i find myself agree with Chris more, i thought the image is rather effective and the fact that it's a black and white photo also adds a somber dimension to the whole subject of slavery. <br>I had been wanting to add bar code(21st century invention) to the tags but it could be too distracting. mmm...hand written number might work though. let me try it. <br>I do like the bold sans SLAVES more cuz it looks more graphic than the serif SLAVES. Maybe i should increase the credit to make it more legible? <br>Thanks both for commenting! =)</div>

<div class=commentbody>i got my solution! or did i?? <br>I am printing one copy to red transparency paper and another to regular cover stock and then stack(off a bit for blurred effect) them together. This way, i can spice up the photo with a prominent color, and at the same time, do away with messing with the photo. (i want to keep the integrity of the photo =P) <br>never tried printing to transparencies, gonna get messy, maybe just give the cover a red tint is easier..mmm..</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The transparency is the best idea yet. Got me thinking of overprinting SLAVES (condensed sans) in red, the full width of the bottom, ultra tight spacing bleeding off the page in 3 directions. 21st Century mixed case and small, flush to the top-left of SLAVES (or possibly over the top left of it) in white or grey. <br> <br>To do the overprint you may need to lighten the image (only behind the letters) since it is dark. Or, create two identical layers of red type in photoshop, one set to 50% opacity, the other to 100% multiply. <br> <br>Don't put anything on the tags or do any photoshop filter trickery, IMHO. <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with Randy that no photoshop trickery should be involved. To me, having the authors name on the top of the image makes this layout less effective. My eyes kind of jump inbetween the type- missing the image. Especially since their orientation creates a diagonal line. <br> <br>Drew</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, Miu, there is a technique that is very popular here. You liquid laminate the cover with the type under the laminate then you print the rest of the book cover with a matte ink over the laminate. The type explodes from the page, at least 10 fold over varnishing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>there are two types of varnish: <br>1. gloss <br>2. matte/dull <br> <br>varnishes can be run as a flat panel or halftone. they are handeled the same as inks and require their own plate on the press. varnishes do work better on coated stocks. they are also a must when running matte inks, to reduce scuffing. and - they do tend to yellow with time </div>

<div class=commentbody>strictly looking at typography, since this is a typography forum, i would say that the word slaves on the second cover looks wrong... tracked-out Impact? (or whatever font that is, which i'd never use...) doesn't look good to me. i also think that the author and his last book shouldn't be full justified. <br> <br>also, i don't think that the photo is soo strong that if there were no typography, i'd be attracted to it and pick it off the shelf. the type could make it more interesting though. </div>

<div class=commentbody>There is also a UV coat ... can't remember (this early Monday morning) which protects (better?) from finger prints. I'm pretty sure it is UV. In which case you could do a flood UV (it is an art book, right?) and a spot high gloss varnish. <br> <br>One book I have in mind, and the reason I suggest "hiding" the type, is Herb Ritt's <i>Africa</i> .. incredibly elegant, understated, refined. The meat of the type is on the spine. Where the type really belongs anyway. Well, in my opinion anyway. If it is a high-impact photo, such as the one you have here, the type will not be necessarily the thing that draws them in. It is the story which the photo is telling. Personally, I think that if the book is lucky enough to be face forward (or up) in the history or art section, or new books piles) you won't need the type. And, when the book is relegated to the shelf, spine out, that is when the type needs to do its job. If you can, I wouldn't make the type near so big, or find a way to make it invade less of the image. And that is why I suggested varnishing. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe try and add grunge to "slaves" and maybe add a grungy border around the cover. That way you wouldn't have to mess too much with the photo. This site by dubtastic has great tutorials and examples of grunge. <br> <br><a href=http://www.dubtastic.com/focus.php target=_blank>http://www.dubtastic.com/focus.php</a> <br> <br>-Tom <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I have final printouts of the bookcover with the original black and white photo, as well as the tinted red one(no poterizing or anything else) for upcoming class critique. I have learned alot from all of you and i want to thank you for continued interest in the project. I didn't get to use all of ur great suggestions on this project, i'm sure they will turn out somewhere else though. =) <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Yesterday I discovered that the children in that photo were not being sold as slaves (ostensibly somewhere in the third world). They were inmates in a US concentration camp (on US soil) during a war (although I forget if it was WWII, the Korean War, or Vietnam). <br> <br>I don't care if it was a school project, I think re-using a picture like this in this way is disgusting. The least one should do is disclose the true nature of the photo to anybody who is asked for a critique. <br> <br>hhp</div>
