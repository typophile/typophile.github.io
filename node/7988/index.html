  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am interested in mid-20th century typography and design, and am looking for a good, representative collection of faces from the era, from 1937&#39;s Coronet up to about Nov 1963: Murray Hill, Futura, Park Avenue, Balloon Extrabold, Gillies Gothic Bold, etc. <BR> <BR>I use Linux exclusively: GIMP for Web-based graphic design and TeX for print-based typesetting. I want to use the fonts primarily in GIMP, for Web work, but I&#39;d also like to be able to use them occasionally with TeX, for the purpose of printing cards, letterheads, and the like. <BR> <BR>Can anyone recommend a source for these fonts, and a format &#40;PostScript Type 1, TrueType, etc&#41; that will work for me?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">For use with TeX, I stick with Type 1, although you can use TrueType and with some pain, OpenType as well. Installing the fonts for use with TeX is not trivial, but it isn&#39;t quite so bad, if you read the excellent <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide/fontinstallationguide.pdf">TeX font installation guide</a>.  <BR> <BR>As for where to buy the fonts, I usually buy from Adobe, Linotype, FontShop, etc. Avoid the generic rip-offs, though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, that&#39;s exactly the information I was looking for! <BR> <BR>I prefer to use Type 1 because they seem to work easy in X; once installed, GIMP and other applications just magically have them. <BR> <BR>Most foundries only seem to offer Mac and Windows options. I suppose Type 1 fonts for Windows on CD or downloaded will work on Linux? <BR> <BR>Just found some of the beautiful old faces I&#39;m looking for available from Linotype.com. Happy to see them but guess I&#39;m a little surprised at the prices for some of these 70-year-old typefaces. A <a href="http://www.linotype.com/89150/gilliesgothic-family.html">single 4-font family</a> will set you back $80-100---the cost of doing business for a commercial publication, surely, but it seems a little impractical for hobbyists and free-lance part-timers! <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to see them sold in packs, like how <a href="http://fontdiner.com/">Font Diner</a> does it. They sell new fonts with a &#34;retro&#34; aesthetic---I haven&#39;t tried them yet but the quality seems good, and you can get about a dozen for $30.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, you will want the PC Type 1 fonts.  <BR> <BR>For buying Linotype faces, often the more you buy, the cheaper the prices. &#40;Just add more to your cart, and the prices update.&#41; Unfortunately, that&#39;s not the case with all the fonts, though. I&#39;d love to get Optima Nova, but not enough people are beating down my door with freelance jobs for me to afford it.</div>

These prices vary depending on the theme and on the fonts themselves: <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-1788-6/compilationvaluepackages.html" target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com/6-1788-6/compilationvaluepackages.html</a> <BR> <BR>We don&#39;t offer discounts for amateur use,&#42; but we do have a 30% discount in place for students. And as Steve mentioned, we offer bulk discounts on individual weight purchases. <BR> <BR>Sometimes, when a new value pack is released, its initial sales price is only around $30. If you sign up for the Linotype newsletter, you can get these special announcements mailed to you every month. <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/webshop/newsletter.php" target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com/webshop/newsletter.php</a> <BR> <BR>Or, you can periodically peruse the News section here on Typophile. We post all of our LinoLetters here, too, if you don&#39;t want more e-mail. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;A font license doesn&#39;t expire. If an amateur buys a font, and turns into a professional later, he still has all of his old fonts at his disposal!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dan, appreciate the links. I took note of the many themed Value Packs, and wonder if Linotype would ever consider releasing Packs of fonts collected by time period? <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to improve my collection with a concern for quality and authenticity over quantity---but this being an amateur operation &#40;at least for now, anyway&#41;, I&#39;m on a tight budget. I have the basic PostScript printer fonts, all of the fonts that come with teTeX, and some of the extra CTAN fonts. Can anyone recommend other sources for obtaining good Level 1 fonts---particularly mid-century---on a budget? <BR> <BR>I keep reading about the Bitstream 500 font CD and the 250 font CD, and they&#39;re recommended in both the comp.fonts FAQ and the Linux Font HOWTO, but these CDs no longer appear to be available by Bitstream, nor do they show up used on eBay. <BR> <BR>One source I did find that offers a collection of type scanned from vintage sources is the <a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/PropFonts.html">HPLHS Prop Fonts</a> CD, and I wonder if anyone here has seen it.</div>
