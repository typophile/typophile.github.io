body: "After several hours searching the web for an html copyfitting table (<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/28083442/BOOK-Elements-of-Typographic-Style\">a
  scan can be found on scribd</a>) I have been unsuccessfull and as the quality of
  the scribd version is poor, my ocr is having a very hard time with it. I would rather
  not ruin or cut the spine of my autographed copy (pun intended) to get a better
  scan. Going through it by hand and manually entering the numbers is a solution,
  but I thought it couldnt hurt to ask the community before I go this route. I'm amazed
  how hard a time I having.\r\n\r\nI need it to be text that I can copy and paste
  so I can make a spread sheet out of it and incorporate it into some statistical
  calculations I am doing with my work. \r\n\r\nAny direction would be greatly appreciated."
