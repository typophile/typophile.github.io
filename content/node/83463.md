  this victorian touch.\r\n\r\nI decided to select and vectorize hundreds of ornaments
  from old nineteenth century type foundry catalog.\r\n\r\nYou can download here a
  free pack with 85 ornaments  : http://www.vectorian.net\r\nIf you like it, you can
  also buy the complete pack at a affordable price (more than 900 ornaments for $57)\r\n\r\nIt's
  nor exactly a font, but it helps  for any typographic antique design.\r\n\r\nI'm
  especially proud of the illustrator frame borders : you can in seconds create antique
  borders by combining them.\r\nIf you resize the frame, the border pattern adapt.\r\n\r\nI
  had a lot fo fun preparing this pack, and I hope you will like it too :-)\r\n\r\nVincent,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@riccardo, it should be should :-)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nBack on track:\r\nNicely
    done, but what are your sources?\r\n\r\nThe Victorian era was very long and encompassed
    many different genres, from revivals to original styles (both Arts and Crafts
    and Art Nouveau occurred during the era).\r\n\r\nThe <em>Manual of Linotype Typography</em>
    of 1923 associates typefaces with ornaments, by style and era.\r\n\r\nNicolete
    Gray's <em>19th Century Ornamented Type Faces</em> does a brilliant job of identifying
    the different genres of Victorian type by decade, and associating them with contemporary
    movements in art and architecture. Perhaps you could use her timeline as a basis
    for metadata, adding depth and resonance to your collection\u2014and it would
    suggest ways of matching type style to type ornament.\r\n"

  body: "Nice suggestion Nick !\r\nAnd some good sources to check, but the one from
    Nicolete Gray cost more than $1000 and is hard to find.\r\nDefinitely out of reach
    for me, I will have to wait to sell more packs ;-)\r\n\r\nI admit that so far,
    I made a compilation without caring too much about classifying by date or rationalize
    it. I'm from a web designer background and I'm not a specialist about typography
    and font history.\r\nI just wanted to provide a large choice of ornaments at a
    fair price (and easy to use with illustrator, I don't like use fonts for ornaments).\r\n\r\nI
    picked ornaments in a lot of different type foudry catalog available by Internet,
    thanks Google books and Gallica ( gallica.bnf.fr )\r\nSo here is some catalogs
    I used :\r\n. American Type Founders\r\n. Barnhart bros. and Splinder\r\n. George's
    Bruce\r\n. Cleveland Type Foundry\r\n. Farmers type foundry\r\n. franklin Type
    Foundry (Cincinati)\r\n. Inland Type Foundry\r\n. Keystone Type Foundry\r\n. Mackellar,
    Smiths 7 Jordan Co.\r\n. Imprimerie Edmond Monnoyer\r\n. Palmer & rey\r\n. Fonderie
    Turlot\r\n\r\nActually, the more I worked on these ornaments, the more I learned.\r\nI'm
    currently reading the old and excellent \"Grammar of ornaments\" by Owen Jones.\r\nAnd
    I realized that behind the nineteenth century, the inspiration for lot of these
    ornaments come from old civilizations (Egypt, Greece, Roma, etc.) and previous
    era (renaissance, Baroque, etc.)\r\nIt would make sense to categorize them in
    this way too.\r\n\r\nSearching ornaments, choosing and vectorize it was a time
    consuming task.\r\nIf these ornaments sells well, I plan to release more and to
    take time to organize it better.\r\nAlso, I would love to create a manual to explain
    the proper way to create genuine ornaments (huge project...)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \u2014 I especially like the way you've sorted the ornaments into different categories
    and explained how to use them in Illustrator.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nPeople always say
    Victorian decoration is derivative of previous cultures, and Jones' book lends
    credence to that understanding.\r\nBut it's much harder to recognize what's new
    and original, within that cauldron of crazy prolific synthetic invention\u2014especially
    for we decoratively challenged children of modernity who have spent a century
    associating newness with the opposite of decoration."

    that from you as I know and love your work :-)\r\nBy the way, I plan to release
    a manual and a demonstration video.\r\n\r\nYou're right about the twentieth century
    rejection of ornaments and decorations. \r\nWe're living in the \"less is more\"
    era, and in my daily job I create minimalist Web Designs (in an Apple / Braun
    style).\r\nThat's maybe why I felt in love with these quaint ornaments, which
    are lively, exuberants and imperfects.\r\n\r\nCreating a victorian inspired website
    was a playful experience, and as a web designer I see more and more vintage design,
    texturized and distressed elements in websites...\r\nDesigners try to inject more
    life in their creations and get rid of the aseptic and clean design.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
