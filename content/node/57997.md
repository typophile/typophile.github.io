  body: Through probably not what you're looking for, I'm going to mention it as a
    cautionary tale for designers everywhere. At the print shop where I work, we had
    a local company want us to die cut their logo into business cards. It was a trident,
    and when we cut it, the negative space between the prongs folded back and ripped
    off and left them with more of a shovel than a trident.
