  body: Sorry but to me, it's not a font, rather a custom job based on some geometric
    sans. You could start for instance with [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avant+garde|Avant-Garde Gothic]], keeping /u
    and /r and recreating all the rest which should be not so hard as they are only
    made with basic geometric shapes.
