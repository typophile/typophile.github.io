  a bit to create a more contemporary, 'Egyptian' style text face, almost like if
  Galliard and Clarendon had a child. This is what I came up with:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cairo_5038.png]\r\n\r\nRight
  now I have just a few glyphs, but before I keep going, I wanted to check with those

    'C', 'a' and 'r' all seem to belong to different typefaces. "

    could look to that style for the mechanical part. As for the calligraphic one,
    I think you should look at how you want the transitions between thick and thin
    to be (for example, the bottom right part of 'a' is quite different from the rest
    in this regard).\r\nStart experimenting with more letters, 'n', for a start."

  body: The /g/ needs a bit more smoothness on the curves of the loop and on the counter.
    Refine the transition of the arc of the /n/. For my taste, the spur of the a needs
    a breath. Separate it a bit from the stem, I'd say.

  body: "Nice start! There are some special features here that bear developing.\r\n\r\nThat's
    an unusual set of serifs on the u, how does it read at small sizes? Also considering
    the right-leaning stem, which again is unusual.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively short
    x-height serifs and large, flat baseline serifs of glyphs like i and n gives them
    a very bottom-heavy appearance, is that the idea?\r\n\r\nDoes r actually have
    a heavier baseline serif than the rest of the glyphs, and in that case why?\r\n\r\nThe
    o looks rather light compared to many of the other glyphs with their thick serifs,
    have you considered a more clarendonesque one? Same, to a certain extent, with
    the v and w - compare to that big, chunky l in vowel.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'd agree
    that the a in its current, rather calligraphic state doesn't really fit the rest
    of the typeface."

    and I like the bezier curves so much more than in FontLab.  That said, it's very
    imperfect for creating a typeface and it's hard to create perfect consistency
    - I'm going to migrate these glyphs into FontLab soon, where it will be easy to
    ensure this.\r\n\r\nThe right-leaning stem of the 'u' and the heavier baseline
    serif of the 'r' are just mistakes :)  I'll change them soon and get back to you!\r\n\r\nIt's
    been tough navigating the space between didone, garalade, and bracketed slab serif!
    This typeface is hopefully going to fill an interesting space in that spectrum,
    but I want it to be consistent.  How can I change the 'a' to make it fit? I agree
    that it's calligraphic - I would love for the other letterforms to reflect that
    aesthetic without turning it into a true garalde - any advice?\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: "I quite like the high contrast in letters like m and n, where the bowl meets
    the stem. It gives a slight human touch to it and make it more unique. However,
    you should also incorporate this in the rest of the font, or get rid of it. \r\n\r\nThe
    terminal in /a/ could be moved to the left slightly. It looks a bit forced now.
    Also the tail looks a bit sharp in comparison to the t.\r\n\r\nRedesign the r
    with the n as a starting point. It looks quirky where it meats the stem.\r\n\r\nThe
    o is too light. Make the curves on the inside more round (less square), and the
    curves on the outside more full (more square).\r\n\r\nThe g's ear is still too
    short and it looks as if you stole the g from a different typeface. It has that
    special kind of ink traps typical for geralde typefaces, but it doesn't fit in
    with the other letters you designed.\r\n\r\nSomething about the t doesn't quite
    work. The top looks too much like a cross I think. Try to give it a human touch.\r\n\r\nRaise
    the dot on i slightly. It looks a bit cramped now.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the
    serifs on the top of stems in n m d b etc, should show a link to how they would
    look in a garalde typeface. Make them slightly wider where they meet the stem,
    or something like that. Just try out as many different versions as you can think
    of.\r\n\r\nKeep going! It's a charming concept. In my opinion much more so than
    the sans serif you're working on.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nJasper"

  body: "Now that some aspects of the typeface have been settled, consistency may
    speak for itself. Right now teardrop terminals seem more appropriate, but you
    should take in account that the forms are not as many as to avoid elasticity in
    the design process. Even after you have picked out a feature for your forms, force
    yourself to reconsider it after some time, my advice. Drawing letterforms on a
    paper sheet (in opposition to working \"ex tempore\" on the screen) is also very
    helpful to come up with new ideas.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, the clarendonian
    'g' doesn't echo the aspects of the other letterforms. Try to fix it; the thin
    of the bowl extends to much, for instance. Also the link of the loop should be
    thicker to flow nicely into the horizontal.\r\n\r\nOther observations:\r\n- Check
    the thin of your 'o'. Right now it looks like a lining zero (so recycle it (:
    ). It is therefore too wide and round to work as an 'o'.\r\n- The upper serif
    of the 'i' needs a bit of lengthening.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to your original 'a'?
    I think it had an interesting vitality. Your revised one is also good, nevertheless.
