  I'm setting the headline on a Campbell's soup can. I was not able to find a font
  that came close enough for my taste, so I'm attempting to mimic the script. I don't
  have any experience lettering so let me know what you think. The Headline Reads
  \r\n\r\nThe Bank \r\nThat Deserves A\r\nBail Out.\r\n\r\nI wanted to wait for some
  opinions before I started the T so I used commercial script as a place holder"

  body: "Super headline. Is this one of a series? If so what are the other lines?
    (there's probably a TARP line to be discovered)\r\n\r\nThe h-e combo is a bit
    awkward since the original e is a result of the high join with the b. But I wouldn't
    worry about it since it's a campbell's distinctive.\r\nRather than set the whole
    headline in Campbell's script, consider using all the type on the can (you may
    already be doing this). \r\nEg:\r\n\"Campbells\" => The Bank \r\n\"CONDENSED\"
    => THAT DESERVES\r\n\"Cream of Mushroom => A Bail Out \r\n\r\nDon't forget to
    show us the final result.\r\n\r\nRandy"

  body: I would erase the distracting join between h-e, just because it's so long
    and thin, but preserve the whole loop in the e. Maybe then kern h-e closer and
    let it join at the bottom.

  body: "Thanks for the good suggestions. Because my deadline was the 10th I didn't
    change much on the type, but I do think I will ditch the high join on the h-e
    like was suggested and  try one where they are connected at the bottom. \r\n\r\nRandy:
    it's not a series right now but I could see it a couple of ways it could be. Glad
    to see we were on the same page about using the same type as on the can. I omitted
    the SOUP face because it would have been clunky.\r\n\r\nHere it is, besides the
    h-e which I plan to fix, let me know what you think. Suggestions for the T?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AustinFoodBank_3827.jpg]"

  body: "I think the stem and crossbar of the T should be joined. That would start
    making it match the B better. If you want to go further perhaps try making the
    crossbar a bit longer on the right side so it is over the h more, and think about
    the relationship between it and the angle of the top of B.\r\n\r\nNice work. Have
    you tried printing the label and photographing it around an actual can? A whole
    stack of these would look great especially if a few were slightly dented."
