  to enter a TimeCode. The confusing thing is that the Letter O and the Number 0 (zero)
  are more or less identical on all fonts.\r\nDoes nayone know of a font where the
  numbers are different (either underlined or a box is around them or a slash / )
  so that when placed near a text we could see the difference.\r\n\r\nThanks"
