  Sonesta* for Thursday, July 7 (when I'll be arriving after midnight actually) to
  Monday, July 11 (let me know if you plan on leaving on the Sunday instead). The
  last time I roomed with anybody was TypeCon-SF in 2004, and although that worked
  out super I hope you'll understand that I would give preference to people I've actually
  met, and second to people who I've got to know online.\r\n\r\n* I spent a good deal
  of time looking around and\r\nnothing strikes nearly as good a balance in terms\r\nof
  cost and convenience.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested please email me: hpapazian at
  gmail dot com.\r\n\r\nFingers crossed...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
