  body: "I can't seem to find one font that matches both the R and the O. (The A is
    probably just an inverted V.) My best suggestion involves two fonts: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/alternate-gothic/|Alternate
    Gothic]] for the letters except for the O, and then something like Chank's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/nicotine/|Nicotine]]
    for the O. I picked that because it was one of the cheaper fonts I could find
    with that O shape.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
