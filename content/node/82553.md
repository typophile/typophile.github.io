    designer should be able to do something like that, or a custom letterer, depending
    on whether you need \u2026 well, custom lettering (as opposed to an existing typeface)."

  body: While I agree that any graphic designer should be able to take a crack at
    it, that kind of highly-dramatic 3D lettering is not something that's needed very
    often, so some designers wouldn't have much experience with it. So I'd look carefully
    at their portfolios to see if they have nice examples showing similar techniques.
    Many designers would subcontract an illustration like that out to a commercial
    illustrator who had a lot of experience with that type of lettering.
