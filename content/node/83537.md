  or was it specially designed for this electricity station. Its pretty cool and I
  see it quite often when out walking.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/smallall_4791.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/small3_4257.jpg]\r\n\r\nthanks

  body: "Don't know why no one answered back in July. The date you posted was right
    in the middle of TypeCon, so maybe there were fewer type geeks paying attention
    here that day.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, it's probably not an actual typeface.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-LMC7th\">Kulukundis</a> is sort of similar in some
    ways, but I don't know of a closer match."
