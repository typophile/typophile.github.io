  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi Typophiles, <BR> <BR>Here is a new typeface I am working on. It was inspired by the tutorials of Computer Arts Specials (Issue 39, pp. 25 and 80). As a neophyte in Typeshire and I was lucky enough to find this place to get some expert ideas and opinions. Entropy intends to be a  nice blend between art deco and contemporary techno style. It has similar X height as Helvetica and a deliberate minimalist design. When completed it will comprise at least five different weights both in normal and italic, and five versions with different horizontal width (from narrow to super extended). The number 03 refers to the narrow version, 07 to the somewhat extended one. I also have created Russian/Cyrillic characters, because it is a good challenge. And a semi-serif version is also under way&hellip;  <BR>For start I would like to put the Entropy 03 Regular version on the balance. Please, give your opinion especially on the following points:   <BR> <BR>1)  Originality - I have started my work from scratch, er&hellip; sketch, but I am deeply concerned that someone else have come up with a quite similar idea before. This is the main reason I publish my half-finished work here to claim priority or, as the case may be, to abandon the whole project. It is a simple design and nowadays I see more and more similar glyphs around.  Is there a way to check that this is an original design, or how much should it differ from the similar ones to merit its own existence? If you know a nearly identical font, please raise your hand! <BR>2)  Oldstyle figures - to keep or to drop them? <BR>3)  Any missing important glyphs necessary for regular use. Language accents are still in the lab. <BR>4)  The name - is there any other font with the same name? Better name, anyone? <BR>5)  Cyrillic characters - are they correct if you consider the design logic? <BR> <BR>All comments (even beyond the four points above) are welcomed and seriously considered. Thanks,  <BR> <BR> <BR>Tybor <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14072.gif" alt="Entropy 03 Regular"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Very nice!!! Reserve me a copy! <BR> <BR>A few nitpicky things: it would be nice to see a little more divergence between Latin and Cyrillic letters (the Ks, Es, Ms, etc). I'm no expert, but I do love the inclusion of Cyrillic here. <BR> <BR>I'd also be curious to see blocks of Latin and Cyrillic text side-by-side; your Cyrillic lowercase letters might look smaller than the Latin and need optical adjustment (enlargement). <BR> <BR>Your percent and per-thousand might look better with circles or forward-o's. The euro sign might look better a bit wider. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When you say you are concerned about its originality, do you mean the letterforms? Combining the angle with the curved edge is not really &quot;original&quot; because it seems like a popular trend nowadays, especially in web design (borders, moreso than letters.)  At the same time, I'm not sure type designers need to really worry about being original. (But maybe moreso here, if you are intending this to be mostly a display face?) <BR>I really like how the lowercase letters come to an abrubt stop at the tops, it seems like that is an identifying feature of this typeface that sets it apart from other techno-like faces. (?) <BR>I really like old style figures in sans serif faces. Do the 3 and 5 (osf) seem too open? The 2 and 3 don't fit perfectly. Maybe if they were cheated slightly thinner? Dunno. <BR>And randomly, are you from Hungary? =) <BR></div>
