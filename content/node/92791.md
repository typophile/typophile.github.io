  to use for both the heads and body copy that says: elegance, contemporary, and is
  readable and legible. I am thinking of both being san Serif and have considered
  Gotham narrow and Whitney, but I want more ideas from folks who know more than I
  do.'

  body: "Whitney is very functional, but it's not elegant, and not too contemporary
    either.\r\n\r\nI might base the choice of the text font on the shape of the \"a\"
    in Gotham. And I would strongly consider a serif (maybe a slab, or sheared wedge)
    although that does depend on how much text you have.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: What is the artwork like? How much text is there? What kind of layout are
    you thinking of?

  body: It is contemporary art quilts. The only thing that links all the images is
    that they are textile / fiber related. The layout, which I am stuck with, is a
    detail on the left page, a full image of the piece on the right. There is an artist's
    statement (One  2-5 sentence paragraph), and the heading is the artist's name
    and city/ state below it as a subhead. Historically that has been in Helvetica
    bold for the names and the rest of the copy in a basic serif - maybe Times. All
    the font sizes have been way too big, so it has had the look of an elementary
    school picture book. I think make the fonts all smaller will go a long way to
    creating a more contemporary and designed look, but that's as far as I have gotten.

  body: "I too would go with a serif, but if there's only 2\u20135 sentences you can
    get away with doing all sans. If you're going all sans, why not use Gotham for
    the text, too? Or maybe throw Archer in there. Or maybe play around with the Thesis
    family \u2026"

  body: "Thanks to its smallish x-height (=elegance) and round-bowl \"a\" Archer might
    work well. Is there something like it but narrower? That would ramp up the elegance
    a bit more.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    could be worth a look.
