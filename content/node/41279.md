body: "I am looking for resources that speak to the different moods/messages/meanings
  created when using different typefaces/classes of typefaces. My interest in this
  stemmed from some recent reading/thinking about colour theory and how different
  palettes and overall tones create vastly different moods and meanings.\r\n\r\nIt
  seems obvious to me that this would apply equally to type. I realize that this is
  an incredibly subjective and often intuitive thing, but surely there are some broad
  issues or even more specific research by individuals into this? \r\n\r\nThere are
  a million resources out there that talk about colour in this way, but I am having
  a tough time finding the right way to seek out similar resources with regards to
  type. So far, any search terms I've tried haven't brought up the right kinds of
  information for which I'm searching.\r\n\r\nSo... all you Typophiles out there...
  what can you recommend?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!"

  body: A few years ago there was an proposed project to build a mood/impression based
    Universal Font Classification System called <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/16326"
    target="new">Type-Expertise</a> but I think it has fallen off the planet.
