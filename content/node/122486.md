  body: "|FERTON| is most likely custom. \r\n\r\nYour sample is a bit small and low-res
    to make an accurate ID, but these suggestions may be helpful if you intend to
    recreate the look: \r\n\r\nNASDAQER (with some artificial italicizing) looks like
    a decent base for recreating |FERTON|:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/nasdaqer.font?text=FERON\r\n\r\nGreta
    Sans Extended Bold Italic might work for |PROFESSIONAL|:\r\nhttps://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_sans_extended"

  body: Thank you very much for reply and suggestions. NASDAQER is good for FERON.
    For PROFESSIONAL I have  tried with Futura Md BT, looks pretty close.
