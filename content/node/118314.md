  body: "More, probably closer: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova|Proxima
    Nova]], [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview|Gotham]]\r\nCan't state
    also if  'SOUTHPAW' and 'TECHNOLOGY' are set with the same font. Either Proxima
    Nova or Gotham could do the trick, main concern would be on /L width which looks
    less large on your sample. I'd probably go with Proxima Nova for first line and
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Avenir|Avenir]] for baseline."
