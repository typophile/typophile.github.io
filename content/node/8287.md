  body: I like this, good idea.  <BR> <BR>I suggest to you to reduce the space between
    the a the y in the word borday and maybe reduce the size of the texte under your
    borday poo. This would leave more room between New Year and the people name. <BR>
    <BR>Good work.

    change the flowers. The first one looked good too but thoses one give a boost
    to the monochrome color of the card. <BR> <BR>For me, I will be happy to receive
    this card. <BR> <BR>Well done.
