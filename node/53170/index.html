  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, first post here, not sure if this is the right place to post this, and I must apologise for creating a rather selfish first post! I've been lurking and meaning to sign up for a long time now, so I'll try to start contributing what I can with the little knowledge I have now as a student.

Anyway, apologies out of the way, I'm doing a dissertation which involves looking at a few typefaces from various angles, and part of it requires me to look at modern usage of these typefaces. And by modern I mean, like, in use in the last year at least.

The only one I'm struggling with is Caslon, with it being so old and serif and all. But, being such a stalwart typeface, I would assume that it must be everywhere, and I just can't see it, and I'm hoping you guys will have a better knowledge of where it might be!

The kind of things I'm looking for are brand identities, advertising, newspapers, magazines, books... well, anything really. I know Caslon doesn't lend itself so much to brand identity, but I am looking for semi-unusual uses, so if anyone knows of it being used in a logo or something like that it would be great! I haven't got my hopes up though, so it would be just as well if anyone knows of a publishing house that uses it regularly, which I imagine is more likely.

Or, if nobody knows of any notable uses, then if anyone has any insight into why that is, then that would be useful too!

Thanks</div>

I spent well over an hour the other day scouring for colophons in a book shop, and only found one use of Caslon in my entire time there! The Knopf tip will be very useful for me next time!

John, if you're right about Wallpaper then that sounds like the perfect example for me, I'll have to pick up the latest copy and track it down, *fingers crossed*

Haha, didn't see the tomb answer coming.

The union station thing sounds very interesting. Signage! I'll email you right away, thanks.

Edit: Just spotted your reply, Kent. I'll check those magazines out for sure, thanks a lot.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you don't see so much Caslon in text because Adobe Caslon isn't distinctive enough to be the separate "brand"--it doesn't capture the magic of the metal text Caslons. It's a very good typeface, but others are rivals in the same space and beat it out. 

Still other digital Caslons look too 'antique', and a number are too light. I hope you'll see Caslon done justice, with something that is modern, but captures the magic of metal Caslons--soon :)  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I found this thread interesting as well.

I remember seeing one book on typography illustrate that Caslon was still useful today by showing its use in closely spaced all-caps in posters for the Leonard J. Waxdeck bird-calling contest.

I know some campuses use Caslon in some form as a typographical identity standard.

What I saw of Caslon in some metal type specimen books looked horribly dated to me, and it seemed not to resemble older books set in Caslon, being an artificially light face. Also, what seemed to me the most widely available form of Caslon was Caslon 540, which has short, stubby descenders.

Adobe Caslon may not be "distinctive", but when I took a look at it, it certainly did seem to be a real Caslon, and to avoid the pitfall of excessive stroke contrast that plagues other Caslons. And yet, I can also see how it could be mistaken for Baskerville (or some such thing) at a quick glance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, looking back at this old thread I said "soon" about my revival of Caslon. It took another year and a half after my post, [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|but here it is.]] 

Quadribloc, I think the stroke contrast on Adobe Caslon is too great to get the letter press Caslon reading comfort and aesthetic. Its proportions are also half way to Baskerville, and I personally like Caslon's original widths in his Roman, I think the rhythm it establishes is one of the original's best features. 

My detailed discussion of Adobe Caslon is in my essay [[http://ilovetypography.com/2010/11/02/reviving-caslon-part-2-readability-affability-authority/|Reviving Caslon on ilovetypography.com]].

There are also several other recent revivals, I think partly in response to the feeling that Adobe Caslon is has its problems. 

I think Adobe Caslon works better in display, and I see it more often there. The Caslon in The New Yorker is not Adobe Caslon.

My own optical sizes—"soon".

Interesting that "bearded" went for ATF Caslon 540, which is a beautiful display face. They used the original letter press, but I believe the digital version is quite good, though I haven't compared them. It is based on Caslon's larger sizes, which are quite different from the small ones. Carter's Big Caslon is also a beautiful interpretation of the very large sizes. </div>

<cite>I think the stroke contrast on Adobe Caslon is too great to get the letter press Caslon reading comfort and aesthetic. Its proportions are also half way to Baskerville,</cite>

Ah, so when I looked at it and thought of Baskerville, I wasn't dreaming.

I agree with you that it has gone too far - it's <em>recognizable</em> as a Caslon by looking at the letterforms, but it just barely qualifies. I think that it is a highly readable typeface, eminently suitable for body copy... and one that might contain 24% lead oxide, but which avoids the iron and the cobalt... but, yes, as far as being a "Caslon", I would agree that a reasonable response would be "why bother" - and use Times Roman, Caledonia or Century Expanded instead. Baskerville or Garamond would be a definite improvement if one was looking to make one's document more unique.

If anything, though, it accords with my typographical tastes well enough that I've learned from it to "be careful what you wish for".

I would not expect anyone in his right mind to set body copy in ITC Caslon 223, as one example. I think going a bit further in the direction of Adobe Caslon than Williams Caslon does is acceptable - but going as far as Adobe Caslon did... yes, I will acknowledge that even if it only gets noticed in the typographic community, there are limits to how much inauthenticity should be accepted.

Of course, if they just hadn't put the name "Caslon" on it, the world would not be hurt by the availability of a nice readable Caslon-influenced typeface. But it probably would not have been noticed, and one can't blame businesses for being commercial.

If hardcover fiction is being published in Adobe Caslon, then it has done some good.</div>
