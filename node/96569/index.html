Found out Pilot Parallel which seems pretty interesting since i&rsquo;m left-handed and it&rsquo;s an afordable pen but&hellip;  what better place to question this than typophile?</p>

<p>Especially if you&rsquo;re left-handed I would personally recommend avoiding broad-nib painting; focus instead on notan (which is determined solely by the border between black and white). Unless you&rsquo;re trying to start a southpaw ductile revolution* (which would be great).</p>

You may wish to search John Neal Bookseller for canted edge nibs. The Parallel pens are very forgiving, free-flowing and responsive. He also has books by various artists on left handed calligraphy which may facilitate your experience.A less expensive route may be some of the chisel edge markers. Elegant writer by Speedball is by far the most durable/long lasting but there are others that come in larger sizes.</div>

<p>And don’t forget the “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->lead pointer tub<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.”</p>
<p>It makes a bit of a mess if you carry it around as the lead shavings can fall out, so you’ll have to wrap it tightly in a small plastic bag. And see that little white thing? That’s similar to a (replaceable) cigarette filter you stick and twist your freshly sharpened lead into to remove excess shavings.</p>

<p>@chrisburton: What technique do you use? The scribble at 30 degrees? Do you find yourself doing more sans-serif, calligraphy, serif&hellip;? That lead holder seems pretty interesting. How is the weight and those things?</p>
<p>@Christopher Dean: Never seen a sharpener for 2mm here ehehe. I&rsquo;ve always used the top cap and it sucks! No need to carry around unless it&rsquo;s around the house.</p>
<p>@5star: Refills are pretty inexpensive but I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s possible to have one of those refillable cartridges from the fountain pens on the Parallel. That seems pretty interesting for me, for example, to mix with water to have another kind of transparency level. I&rsquo;ve always found that pure black is not really the way to work on font production unless it&rsquo;s already on the computer. Do you really use that whole lot? :P What kind of work do you do?</p>
<p>By the way people, books? I have some collectible books and even left-hand calligraphy book but I think I need a book of techniques (besides this left-hand calligraphy) and sort of.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First off Hrant&hellip; lettering is not painting, so just put that out of your mind! Still, you persist in trying to sway others with misnomers.
Secondly, do you think that lettering artists/calligraphers go willy nilly into the dark when designing a font. That tells me you are thoughtless, and or ignorant of my &ldquo;ilk&rsquo;s&rdquo; process. 
Thirdly&hellip; Notan is inherent in the practice of lettering/calligraphy, probably more so than laying down outlines. Outlines give no hint of black/white relationships until there is the presence of both. And you cannot calculate the &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; until you define those two elements and look for that &ldquo;other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this is about tools&hellip; and your unbending resolve to disallow two different approaches to co-exist.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Noordzij&rsquo;s formulation is indeed extremely valuable in understanding what has been. Paradoxically it&rsquo;s also valuable because it makes it easier to escape the fallacy that is chirography; it&rsquo;s easier to overcome something when you know exactly what it is, and we all owe Noordzij that. The past cannot escape from tradition, but the future can, and it always does eventually. I just hope to be alive to see this particular tradition go the way of the tasty but stupid Dodo.</p>

<p>Ideas never die - at most they go dormant. And I&rsquo;m not even sure I would enjoy the total absence of chirography. There will always be a place for it - always some people who will make chirographic type, much of it nice to look at. My real contention is -and has long been- that the idea of chirography gets too much mileage it doesn&rsquo;t deserve, and there&rsquo;s not enough exposition of its drawbacks. I often position myself at extremes not because I&rsquo;m an extremist at heart, but essentially as a well-meaning slap in the face, aimed at people I expect more from.</p>
<p>Thankfully there is a growing, if rag-tag guerrilla army of what I&rsquo;ve been calling &ldquo;liminographers&rdquo;: designers who consciously violate chirography in favor of the direct creation of notan. This &ldquo;anti&rdquo; stance is merely an initial reaction. Eventually type will be made by people who simply ignore chirography, and it will be my own favorite kind.</p>

<p>@joelsantos I don&rsquo;t use pens so Calligraphy is out of the question. My work strictly consists of script lettering at this time. The Staedtler lead holder I mentioned above is quite phenomenal. It&rsquo;s pretty lightweight for me and doesn&rsquo;t feel too big in my fingertips. I would absolutely agree with @ChristopherDean about the tub sharpener. The lead holder itself has one attached however, it leaves shavings everywhere and all over your fingers (potentially smudged on your paper as well if you&rsquo;re not careful).</p>
<p>As for rulers, I just use an ordinary stainless steel one.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jason, the Typowiki entry on notan is a good explication of the word&rsquo;s common meaning and origins. Hrant&rsquo;s usage carries with it a number of additional assertions, which I think result in question begging when presented as such, but which are due proper consideration when posed as questions. So, for example, near the beginning of this thread Hrant asserts that notan ' is determined solely by the border between black and white', from which he infers then that outline drawing (&lsquo;liminography) is the only way to attain notan in type design. Now, clearly, neither the first assertion nor the inference is implied by the common understanding of notan as derived from East Asian aesthetics of dark and light, as outlined in the Typowiki. Notan is something that exists whenever light and dark are present in direct relationship, so obviously exists in all typically contrasted text, whatever the means of its making. In terms of traditional use of the term, what matters are canons of beauty associated with notan, and hence it makes eminent sense to talk about notan in the context of calligraphy; indeed, this is one of the main uses of the term in Japanese aesthetics, and serves to link calligraphy with sumi-e  and other styles of painting that make use of light and dark relationships, and with traditional design practices. Hrant&rsquo;s use of the term, then, must be seen as novel or idiosyncratic, although I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that and find it a useful shorthand term for referring to something like &lsquo;the relationship of structure and space in type design, in which structure is presumed to be black and space white, or some similar dark/light contrast&rsquo;. The problem I have with Hrant&rsquo;s use isn&rsquo;t its novelty or its independence of the common usage, but the question begging that goes into his secondary assertions and inferences. When these are rephrased as questions, the whole topic becomes more interesting to me and opens on to possible dialogue:</p>
<p>Is notan a functional concept in reading? In what way?</p>
<p>Is this functionality enhanced or impeded by (para)chirographically achieved notan?</p>
<p>What other design processes might be used to create typographic forms?</p>
<p>How do you establish criteria for functionally good notan in a writing system independent of writing?</p>
<p>There are other questions that follow from these.</p>

<p>Yes, because it is the only thing that is read.</p>

<p>You claim that &lsquo;notan is the only thing that is read&rsquo;. But that really does demand a very precise technical definition of notan from you, one which accounts for letter recognition as well as bouma recognition, since both are pretty clearly activities within reading. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ve ever seen such a definition from you.</p>
<p>Earlier in this thread you stated that notan &lsquo;is determined solely by the border between black and white&rsquo;. Evidence indicates that we don&rsquo;t perceive the border between black and white <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as such<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at text sizes, only at larger sizes. So it might be useful to elaborate on the function of notan relative to spatial frequency in small areas and structure recognition.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;we read notan&rdquo; requires a precise technical definition; I think it&rsquo;s more of an abstract truism - not very actionable except for laying a foundation for further thought. What does require a precise technical definition is &ldquo;bouma&rdquo;, and I firmed that up back when I wrote the piece &ldquo;The Bouma Supremacy — they should have left Herman alone&rdquo; :-) for Typo magazine (issue #13):</p>
<p>A bouma is a cluster of letters that is recognized -in parallel with other boumas- as one thing, anywhere in the field of vision, thanks to a combination of frequency, contextual expectation, distinctiveness and clarity. It can be a single letter (in the fovea, where single letters are fully clear), it can be a whole word (deep into the parafovea, thanks to high frequency, expectation and distinctiveness) but is not necessarily either. So a letter is a special-case bouma, and so is a whole word.</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;notan is determined solely by the border&rdquo;, I mean &ldquo;determined&rdquo; in the mechanical design sense: it is what we make when we&rsquo;re making a glyph (a reality that [para]chirography contradicts). The border isn&rsquo;t what is perceived by the reader; that would be notan.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The “para” comes from me, but I don&rsquo;t remember when I first introduced it.</p>
<p>In the contention-laden forum which Hrant highlighted earlier — <a href="http://typophile.com/node/48843">http://typophile.com/node/48843</a> — I wrote: “As I understand it, chirography is paraphrastic of the pen. This is different than saying some type is para-paraphrastic. Etymologically <!-- raw HTML omitted -->para-<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beside<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->alongside of<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beyond<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. For me para-paraphrastic is not a program or stance, but a [adding now: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->universal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->] type-historical fact.”
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/48843#comment-299053">http://typophile.com/node/48843#comment-299053</a>
i.e., my post (last page) of 1 Sep 2008 — 4:01pm</p>
<p>Much of this is serious word-play. The root word in all of this is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->paraphrase<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>In the next paragraph I wrote: “Legato is para-paraphrastic” and explained what it might mean to say this.</p>
<p>Elsewhere I wrote that what Hrant calls chiro-graphic is actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chiro-referential<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Legato is para-paraphrastic without being directly chiro-referential. Hrant likes to use the phrase anti-chirographic. Anti-chirographic is a stance or attitude —which Hrant is keen to promote — that I would call anti-chiro-referential or post-chiro-referential.</p>
<p>The importance of saying Legato, for instance, and Turnip too, are para-paraphrastic is that it recognizes that nothing is from scratch, and encourges one to trace how the contrast in and construction of Legato deviate from conventional writing in it’s variants. In the thread I used the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->para<!-- raw HTML omitted --> word “parasitical” and discussed the essence of type-design as feature manipulation that involves positive and productive or beneficial norm-violation, which —adding to this now — in digital technologies is splino-graphic or bezier-o-graphic or vector-based. [same thread, starting with 1 Sep 2008 — 6:40am, point 4 of the second set of points.]</p>
<p>The shapes produced by actual conventional writing with a broad-nibbed or pointed-nibbed pen can, if they are well-understood, function as a template for understanding the nature of the forms in faces that are produced by para-paraphrastic feature manipulative work or play. The goal can be enhanced readability or expression.</p>
<p>Understanding the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nature<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the forms as shapes in para-paraphrastic / non- or anti- chiroreferential instances is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> achieved by trying to write these forms with varying pressure on, or twists and turns of the broad-nibbed or pointed-nibbed pen, but seeing the para-paraphrastic / non- or anti- chiroreferential instances against the background of the form-templates — as form-analytic foils — these tools produce.</p>
<p>Gerrit Noordzij showed me the heuristic value of this in relation to the “clipped” forms of Henk Krijger&rsquo;s Raffia Initials and the similar forms of his contempory Helmut Salden.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hk_ri_G_clipping_5958.jpg]</p>
<p>I tried to do something in a similar vein for Legato here:

i.e., my post page 2, 25 Nov 2005 — 3:04pm
“[…] the tension caused by Bloemsma’s rotation seems to make the white of the word more active or salient vis a vis the black. Here he is in a line that includes W. A. Dwiggins. If I am right (in my understanding of perceptual processing in reading) about the place of &lsquo;the map of salient whites&rsquo; in reading (see the “bouma as bounded map thread’) we can see why Bloemsma is justified in thinking he is reconnecting (optically, ‘after-helvetica’) the single units of our scripts, or restoring and extending the optical integrity of the wordform.”</p>
<p>In saying “Bloemsma’s rotation seems to make the white of the word more active or salient vis a vis the black,” I am alluding to the notan characteristics of the font and reflecting my contention that both the black and white of the word are information for vision.</p>
<p>I think what I want to argue in this thread on “hardware” is that one doesn’t have to negate what Noordzij has called, in an as yet untranslated essay, the primacy of the pen, in order to be progressive, inventive and experimental, or embrace what makes Legato so unique. In fact, my analysis reveals rather than reduces it and gives a basis to articulate it&rsquo;s genius.</p>

You can&rsquo;t insist that notan is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->functional<!-- raw HTML omitted --> concept in reading, and then retreat to saying that &lsquo;we read notan&rsquo; is an &lsquo;abstract truism&rsquo;, a phrase which prompts even more questions.</p>
<p>In order for an idea to be a functional concept, you have to explain how it relates to functionality, in this case how it relates to the perceptual and cognitive processes of reading (or, at least, to a particular model of how such processes function). If you can&rsquo;t do this, you have not got a functional concept, but only a borrowing of a word from Japanese aesthetic philosophy and that ends up meaning &lsquo;black and white relationship&rsquo; in the context of typography and reading. If all you are saying is that relationship of contrasting shape and ground is what we read, well, duh!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s certainly possible to be all those things within the confines of chirography.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Subversive chiro-apologism? Psychological lethargy?</p>
<p>Hrant, If you read my posts carefully, and with a hermeneutical ethic of generosity rather than pre-judice or suspicion, you would know I am an energetic apologist for constructive feature manipulation and untrammled exploratory norm-violation, with the internal, optical consolidation and ‘divergification’ of the bouma or word-form for visual processing as the principal goal, when it comes to text type. In our digital environment such feature manipulation is spline- or bezier-o-centric, which is what Bloemsma worked with.</p>
<p>Where I said “the tension caused by Bloemsma’s rotation seems to make the white of the word more active or salient vis a vis the black,” I could have said “the tension caused by Bloemsma’s deliberate de-coupling of inner and outer contours — your “breaking of the black” — seems to make the white of the word more active or salient vis a vis the black.” In his own write-up Bloemsma talks of the “outer and inner forms behaving relatively independently.” The idea that skewing or shearing and rotating were involve at the bezier level comes from Jan Middendorp’s graphic in the &ldquo;What makes Legato so Unique&rdquo; forum: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/55783#comment-334509">http://typophile.com/node/55783#comment-334509</a>, and the discussion that followed Middendorp’s 12 Mar 2009 — 11:31am post. I think the graphic comes from Bloemsma himself.</p>
<p>Is your analysis of the functional effect fundamentally at odds with my analysis relating to notan and readability?</p>

<p>So Legato is lifeless? Or does it just mean Legato is post-chiro-referential, and my analysis show to what degree and what effect? It is doubly so, systematically across the letter set, and to beneficial effect, as most of us agree. There is no dead King, because the precedent of tool-based writing is originary, but not dictatorial. The proud handmaiden or humble butler of analysis that writing-derived heuristic-templates provide is not dead.</p>
<p>You may not want to talk about this more, but dismissive gestures are no substitute for argument. I am however satisfied with having providing a bit of push-back. Your truism about notan could use some of that as well, as John&rsquo;s engagment on that score suggests. Despite my caveats, I think calling the attention of type designers to notan and to the importance of not being beholden to the pen-based coupling of inner and outer contours is absolutely apt, timely and laudable.</p>

<p>At some point — even, or especially in a from-scratch process — the designer has to get a handle on or structural understanding of the formal characteristics or logic of his or her positive and negative shapes, if he or she is going to exploit the products of his or her liminographic explorations intelligently and productively and make them into an internally cohesive font that promotes internally cohesive boumas.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Notan exists whenever a mark with more than one dimension is made. Liminography is limited on account of this. The key is the distribution, and in type, the equipotency and resolvability into tractable positive and negative shapes (strokes or ‘role-units’ like bowls and stems, counters) of the light and dark. Liminography <!-- raw HTML omitted -->adjusts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the light / dark distribution and manipulates the tractability of both the black shapes and the whites, but doesn’t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->create<!-- raw HTML omitted --> notan. We ‘read,’ in the sense of ‘perceptually process,’ the shapes but not the distribution. Visual or optical equi-potency in the distribution guarantees that both the white and the black have a proper salience and a proportionate cue-value for efficient visual processing within the framework of the word-gestalt. This is what, in my analysis, the user needs.</p>
<p>The written forms that have been effectively built upon para-paraphrastically in the typographical era do not persist in their typographic progeny because of authorial preference or narcissistic indifference, but because they proved to be fit for reading as a visual task. The contrast and construction options they engendered facilitated the psycho-physical unitization of the word-object, a language-appropriate level of bouma-divergance, and guaranteed the automaticity of rapid and effortless visual word-form resolution for skilled, non-dyslexic readers,  That is, what the visual cortex of the end-user needs for rapid automatic visual word-form resolution —aka word recognition — has always been the principal countervailing pressure or hidden hand in the determination of what scriptorial conventions survived.</p>
<p>Every part of the reading / writing matrix is thoroughly circumstantial or conditioned by circumstance, including the evolved structure and plasticity of the brain, right down to the very first layers of the visual cortex and structure of the retina. The reading-ware of the brain both adjust to and disciplines the products of the writing hand and the typographic multiversity that flowed from the first retranscriptions of it in type.</p>

<p>I do not advocate chirography. Denialism of the prospects for building exceptionally fit alternative forms on an intrinsically convention-breaking premis has nothing to do with it. I sometimes think your anti-chirographic stance is oedipal. I think your strongly polarizing stance is more ideological, divisive and non-inclusive than conceptually obvious, sufficiently experientially grounded and motivated or tested in practice.</p>
<p>I am interested in what happens to contrast and construction historically and the beneficial purpose manipulating these serve in human factors terms. The construction and contrast styling templates circumstantially produced by writing give me an priviledged window into plotting and getting an accurate handle on what happens to contrast and construction historically. The beneficial purpose manipulating these serve in human factors terms is the reason for my immersion in the science of reading.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m being ideological. That&rsquo;s the only way to progress. I&rsquo;m not running a school for mass-producing chiro-zombies, god save their cultural futures.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even if one believes that anything that&rsquo;s needed eventually gets invented (which I&rsquo;m not sure I do) it remains that time has not yet finished.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sure, for example. Every visible mark requires tools (that affects the result). But I&rsquo;m certainly not saying that the chisel &amp; mallet for example is superior to the bézier - just that they&rsquo;re different. I love béziers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I thought you&rsquo;re already doing that.</p>
<p>OK, let me try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you agree that many (even most) people believe in low vertex counts?</li>
<li>Do you agree that people like to save time?</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Sadly I think that&rsquo;s almost 100% true. Almost. It&rsquo;s that tiny remaining glimmer that somehow drives us. Very little of type design makes sense devoid of the reasons type designers greatly exaggerate -or simply invent- to keep doing what they like. The consolation is that nothing anybody ever does is only about money.</p>

<p>Dunno, I think Constantia has a pretty big installed-base.  :-)

<p>You are saying you know what people dead 30 centuries wanted, saw, knew about words and their relation to the tools&hellip; good luck with that. My general impression, is that we have the Greeks to thank for introducing us to the idea that we don&rsquo;t always have to be in a hurry, and the Romans refined this to allow for some to hardly ever be in a hurry, which led to you, the crown of unhurried creation.</p>

<p>Listen, Hrant: I admire your tenacity and appreciate your restlessness. I think most of us are with you here. But breaking the black is a crap shoot, unless it’s done systematically in followable and well-considered / well-motivated ways. And liminography is even more of a crap shoot, unless the critical opening drag-line paraphrases something you’ve assimilated — perhaps with modifications — from past designs. Progressive evolution is descent with modifications. The farther you go back into typographical lines of descent, the closer you get to actual successful species of writing, so a Noordzij style analysis of form is actually very relevant, and your opening move already evokes writing. I&rsquo;m assuming your opening drag-line (the opening line a spider puts down) is not a context-less ‘random-walk’ line. Nothing that we’ve seen from you so far shows me that your method brings you any closer than Dwiggins or Bloemsma, or Matthew Carter, or David Berlow, or Lucas de Groot, or Peter Verheul, or Gerard Unger to the optimal zone on the plateau that Matthew Luckiesh’s research and hints from ‘noisy accumulator’ models of perceptual processing suggest exists. What we&rsquo;ve seen from you is interesting amd idosyncratic, but not monumentally compelling.</p>
<p>Notan is only one of the things the visual cortex needs for effortless and automatic word-recognition. It also needs well-formed and tractable positive and negative shapes, at the level of stems and bowls and counters, that it can readily assimilate or understand.</p>
<p>I would like to see your notan-sensitive liminography in action, preferably on you-tube, where I can see what you&rsquo;re doing, with a play-by-play voice-over of what you are thinking when you are doing, and an mri. I&rsquo;m not interested in finished forms, just the self-imposed constraints and decisional feedback loops.</p>
<p>But perhaps its time for me to step back.</p>

<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve wrestled with for a while. And it is in fact the flaw in Bloemsma&rsquo;s work (which I might have actually opined to him once - I forget). Like most designers, he&rsquo;s too Modernist. You have to let go. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Life<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a crap-shoot. Which is actually harder for me to work with than it is for most people, even for most designers. But that&rsquo;s not the same as random (which I&rsquo;ll never be a fan of).</p>
<p>So you take you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->liminographic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> tool of choice, you clear your mind of chirography, and you make notan. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Progress is hard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not an once of doubt about that. I haven&rsquo;t publicized the proto-implementations of my ideas yet (for various reasons). In fact my usable output remains firmly in the realm of parachirography (for which I publicly reprimanded myself during my talk in Mexico City by slapping my own hand :-). But admitting the problem is the first step (and -unlike most practitioners- I&rsquo;ve gone quite a bit beyond that).</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll never make anything usable with these ideas. But to me that&rsquo;s still better than never having good ideas to begin with; better than running a school to teach others to perpetuate a misconception (which really chaps my hide).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>May I offer a suggestion?</p>
<p>Take a series of typefaces that you admire, set up as actual text made up of words; make a composite image if their proportions are compatible; introduce a large amount of blur, so you can&rsquo;t tell where the edges were; bring the resultant image into your font creation software as a template to draw over, or overlay a printout with tracing paper. Find notanically sensitive path-ways liminographically against / inside / in relation to the highly blurred template. Try to get an analytic handle on and formalize the resultant black and white shapes; throw it away and do it again with a different word.</p>
<p>Your shapes will be anchored in convention, but not directly disciplined by frontal arithmatic.</p>
<p>This is limino-palimsest.</p>
