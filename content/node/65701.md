  good bookstores to visit. The subject: anything old/second hand on typography? All
  tips more than welcome!\r\n\r\nI have already found this one via the Typophile site:
  Collinge & Clark, 13 Leigh Street.\r\n\r\nThnx!\r\nS "

  body: I also looked through Typophile for relevant stores before heading to London.
    Aside from Collinge & Clark, the other place for secondhand type books I'm aware
    of is the <a href=http://quintobookshop.co.uk/>Quinto Bookshop</a>. It's on Charing
    Cross Road, which I would recommend walking along. There are a ton of used bookshops
    there; at one I found Johnston's <em>Writing, Illuminating & Lettering</em> for
    cheap. Check out Cecil Court, too; there were a bunch of interesting antique stores
    there, and I bought a seventeenth-century map there with terrific lettering for
    a reasonable price.

    Bride Library.]] A typophile's dream come true.

  body: Just a few blocks north of Collinge & Clark is the British Library. This is
    worth a visit anyway, as there are usually interesting exhibitions, but their
    bookshop is also very good and has a whole section on typography and printing.

  body: "Between Charing Cross road between Cambridge Circus and Leicester Square
    tube are plenty of old book stores. Also on this stretch is Koenig Books which
    sells some nice new books. There are some more bookshops (and general collectibles,
    cards, prints, maps etc) between Charing Cross Road and St Martin's Lane.\r\n\r\nI
    seem to recall there are some second hand book stores across the way from the
    British <em>Museum</em> too, which I imagine you might visit.\r\n\r\nAlso you
    should visit http://www.stbridefoundation.org/ but check it is open before you
    go. I think you can view some things there by appointment. Not sure anything is
    for sale!\r\n\r\nBest, enjoy London."

  body: In Angel there is a small street called Camden Passage that sells lot's of
    antiques etc, sometimes there are interesting books there. Best to check it out
    if you are in the area rather than go purposefully.
