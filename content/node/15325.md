  the rules of the script. What I know is through experience in my father's printshop
  and my own conclusions. I would like to read something to advance my knowledge.\r\n\r\nProbably
  Hrant knows of some books, or maybe has writen a book or an article about it?"

  body: "I'm not aware of any books in English on Armenian typography per se, and
    have not seen any books that treat the script in terms of typesetting rules or
    as a style manual. There is a quite good book in French, <em>Le livre arm\xE9nien
    \xE0 travers les \xE2ges,</em> which shows good examples of traditional Armenian
    typography, and I have a volume in Italian on Armenian printing at the monastery
    of San Lazzaro in Venice.\r\n\r\nThe best book by far on the Armenian script is
    <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/8772885564\">Album of Armenian
    paleography</a>,</em> but this deals with handwriting and formal manuscripts,
    not typography.\r\n\r\nCarolyn Puzzovio presented an overview of the history of
    the Armenian script, including some recent type designs, at the ATypI conference
    in Helsinki last week. She may know of books dealing with Armenian typographic
    practice, if they exist, and will be in Yerevan next month. I can put you in touch
    if you send me an e-mail: tiro[at]tiro.com"

    a book about history of Armenian scripting, information who create   it, or you
    just want to get as many Armenian scripts as possible.\r\nThere are some books
    printed in Armenia, but they are kind of portfolios  of typographers - the book
    authors'."

  body: "My own experience tells me such books are hard to find.\r\n\r\nThe book John
    mentioned is a great resource of the Armenian manuscript hands. Here's a preview:\r\nhttp://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/books_for_sale/album_of_armenian_paleography.htm\r\n\r\nI
    found one in the British Library\r\nGortsakalyan, Hayk. \"Haykakan taratesakner\".
    Yerevan: Academy of Sciences of Soviet Armenia, 1973\r\n\r\nand another two in
    the Armenian Institute in London\r\nMnatsakanyan, Henrik. \"Armenian typefaces\".
    Yerevan: Ayastan, 1979\r\nAfrikyan (or Africkian), Fred. \"The art of letter-type;
    120 tables of Armenian decorative types\". Yerevan: Sovetakan Grogh Publishers,
    1984\r\n\r\nThe last one is more about calligraphy and display types than typography.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\nContact me directly if you need more details: miguelsousa (at)

  body: "Thanks John & Mike for the info.\r\n\r\nTigran, I need the history of the
    script including additions/changes, and rules, not grammatical rules but scripting
    rules, typographic rules.\r\n\r\nI did not expect to find any foreign (English)
    books covering the subject, that is why I asked if Hrant has any information.\r\n\r\nThe
    Album of Armenian paleography looks very interesting, and pretty expensive. I
    will probably not use all the info in that book, since it is more oriented towards
    manuscript analysis."

  body: "Levon, I haven't yet found a book specifically dealing with Armenian typographic
    guidelines - although I suspect there is one, maybe done either a long time ago
    (think the Mekhitarians) or maybe quite recently (Soviet times). What can be useful
    though are books about grammar, or language in general. I do have one book (actually
    in photocopy form) which has been more useful than most, since it deals with how
    each letter/character is used: \"Oughagrakan Bararan Hayeren Lezvi\" (Orthographic
    Dictionary of Armenian Language) by Artashes Abeghian, 1947. It also contains
    a list of 15,000 Armenian root words (useful for building a spelling checker,
    I mean a good one, not like the ones we currently have, something my brother was
    attempting a while back).\r\n\r\nSome other useful books (like one detailing the
    differences between Eastern and Western Armenian, a critical thing to be aware
    of) I acquired from the famed \"Vernissage\" flea market in Yerevan in 2000; there
    I found many specimen books (like the ones Miguel mentions) for like $3 each,
    as well as linguistic books (like letter frequencies, etc.). If you've never been
    there, go as soon as you can. And the rest of the country is even more amazing!
    I've been dying to go back, and I probably will next Summer.\r\n\r\n\"Album of
    Armenian paleography\" is staggeringly good. I found out about it thanks to John,
    and will undoubtedly buy it one day. For now I've made one long trip to the UCLA
    library with a digital camera, and a tripod. :-) And although it's true that it
    deals with manuscripts, it's extremely useful in terms of: rediscovering old ideas
    of how to make letters, especially tricky ones like the \"ho\"; and when you make
    a funny shape and some people complain, these are exactly the type of people you
    can shut up by showing that it's been done before.  :-)\r\n\r\n> maybe has writen
    a book or an article about it?\r\n\r\nBook? No way. :-/ Article? Well, I've given
    talks about \"Latinization\", including an emphasis on Armenian, in Rome and Thessaloniki;
    and through this topic I've delved into how a non-Latin script <cite>should</cite>
    use the Cartesian area (e.g. NOT like Latin), ending up with an article that's
    been published in Spatium magazine (#4) and will shortly appear in the Greek \"Hyphen\"
    publication as well. It's called \"Latinization: prevention and cure\" and one
    thing it shows it the ergonomy?, topology?, of the Armenian script and how to
    make it most... comfortable. So it's not exactly what you're looking for, but
    sort of a wider/deeper look at the entire structure of what I feel the Armenian
    scripts <cite>needs</cite> to be.\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\n1) John, please do put me in
    touch with Puzzovio!\r\n2) A big welcome to Tigran.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    any of these books or even similar ones. Since you mentioned it, and since Puzzovio
    will be there next month, I am thinking of going there myself. I will have the
    chance to meet Puzzovio and visit vernisssage to check the books.\r\n\r\nAny chance
    you can send me your articles/interviews?"

    at vernissage? I will not be able to go to Armenia, although I would have loved
    to meet Puzzovio.

    they are holding international competitions and symposiums about Armenian typography.
    Some beautiful typefaces have been designed since. I hope you enjoy it. Find me
    on Facebook (Ruben Malayan), because I also have a lot of material about Armenian
