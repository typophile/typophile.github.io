  body: "I take it this is from a game? Perhaps it's a custom display built up from
    default building blocks in the game?\r\nIt's not any of the fonts I know that
    look like they were made by similar principles: Apple's Techno, Primex, Rotundus,
    Geiger (based on Commodore 64 games), Badloc, Concrete, or Excelsior Sans.\r\nDon"
