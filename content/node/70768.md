body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm putting together a newsletter and wondered what you thought
  of this combination. We have licences for Guardian Egyptian text and Stag. Although
  I wouldn't normally pair two similar fonts, the proportions are quite different.
  Stag seems to convey a more friendly attitude suitable for the headlines and Guardian
  of course packs in a lot more letters per column.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick grab:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stag_5038.png]\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yes. The size difference keeps their similarities from rubbing against each
    other and their shared design traits and origin (Christian Schwartz) make for
    a harmonious whole.

  body: The x-height difference on the inline switch ("back page") looks awkward to
    my eye.

  body: Yes, that looked odd to me too. I'll fiddle the point size I think. It looks
    a bit like it's floating above the baseline too. Maybe I should just license Guardian
    bold!

  body: Might as well grab Guardian bold, it's always useful to have bold/italic versions.
