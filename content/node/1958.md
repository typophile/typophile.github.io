  released their Optima nova? The article on creativepro &#40;see the News &amp; Events
  section&#41; is from Nov. 3rd, but I think the font has been released somewhat longer
  ago &#40;I found different dates in different sources&#41;. Some fellows and I are
  just wondering. <BR> <BR>Regards <BR>jpg <BR> <BR>PS: Don&#39;t hesitate to post
  your thoughts about the revised Optima if you have some.'

    the italic is amazing. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR> <BR>here&#39;s a quick comparison. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/19873.gif"
    alt="comparison"> <BR> <BR>[although i&#39;m not sure i&#39;m comparing like with
    like, as they&#39;ve classified the weights slightly differently &#40;old: roman,
    medium, demi-bold etc; new: light, regular, medium etc&#41;. i assume the old
    version didn&#39;t have a light weight.]  <BR> <BR>hrant, i&#39;d be interested
    to see a list of what you consider to be nova&#39;s innovations. the &#39;beakification&#39;
    of some of the the terminals for example. i assume kobayashi has done a lot of
    work on hinting and letterspacing'

  body: i love the bit where zapf says he had no time to design a true italic for
    the original release &amp; had to do the slanted roman in a day!

  body: Thank you for your replies. <BR> <BR>Personally, I think that the old Optima
    &#40;allow me to call it Optima classica&#41; hasn&#39;t become obsolete and can
    still justify its existence. It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t like Optima nova.
    I do. How could I not? The Optima nova family is really easy on the eyes &#40;I
    do like those italics and Optima Titling&#41;, well constructed, significantly
    more complete than its predecessor and thus pretty versatile &#40;as could be
    said - much to my delight - about the whole Linotype Platinum series&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>But for me, Optima classica shows a pattern of elegance Optima nova hardly
    can come up to. Undoubtedly, Zapf and Kobayashi knew what they were doing when
    they &#40;maybe bravely&#41; redesigned Optima and possibly they had slightly
    different objectives in mind than Zapf has had back in the Fifties. The new, more
    serifed Optima obviously has some strong qualities of its own, but, IMHO, can&#39;t
    fully replace Optima classica &#40;and perhaps was never meant to&#41;. <BR> <BR>Again,
    your opinion is most welcome. <BR> <BR>jpg

  body: '&#62; Optima classica shows a pattern of elegance <BR>&#62; Optima nova hardly

    from its previous phototype version. <BR>The flares were exaggerated. In Optima
    Nova, the  <BR>flares are much more subtle, making the typeface  <BR>more elegant,
    IMHO. <BR>OTOH, I don&#39;t quite like the new italics, especially <BR>because
    of those &#39;f&#39; and &#39;g&#39;.'
