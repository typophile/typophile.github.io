body: Greetings, <BR> <BR>I leave this Saturday to teach a class at Altos de Chavon
  in the Dominican Republic and need to give a lecture on typeface design that has
  based its aesthetics on a historical revision and/or aesthetic.  <BR> <BR>Does anyone
  have a really nice typeface they&#39;ve developed based on a these criteria? If
  so, would you be willing to lend me samples and process so i can present it? Of
  course, the designer&#40;s&#41; would get full credit.

  body: I think Renard is a good example, not only because of its achievements but
    also because you can read in two books &#34;Type Now&#34; and &#34;counterpunch&#34;
    the author approach to revivals. <BR>I would consider also the Dutch Type Library
    &#40;<a href="http://www.dtl.nl" target="_blank">www.dtl.nl</a>&#41; revivals
    because they were made according with a serious criteria and whether you agree
    or not with it F. Blokland can explain it and ussualy he is avalilable in typophile
    forums. <BR> <BR>Regards. <BR> <BR>Ramiro.

    least don&#39;t tell Unger his fonts are revivals... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: '&#62;&#62;&#39;being serious makes a font a &#34;revival&#34;. <BR> <BR>Well,
    in any way I said that. What I mean is that is better to consider serious revivals
    made by people that worked on it with a criteria they can explain in detail. <BR>There
    are many approaches to visit an historical design and is good to have these ideas
    written and available, specially for academic purposes. <BR>'
