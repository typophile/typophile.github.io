    enough, someone else recently posted an ID request for the \u201CPUBLIC TELEPHONE\u201D
    type on a telephone sign identical to the one in the lower left of the photo you
    posted....\r\n"

  body: 'Probably hand-lettered to me as all repeating letters look different. Agree
    for the rest, Tempo and Florida are  good calls for alternatives. This reminds
    me of condensed versions of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]] (Tempo
    is kinda very close), [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/kabel|Kabel]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/erbar|Erbar]].
    Adding to the list some I like for this kind of lettering: [[http://www.dafont.com/american-purpose-stripe-1.font|American
    Purpose]] (/S looks particularly close but probably too fancy for the rest), [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/supra|Supra]]
    (for everything except /R), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/formata-pro|Formata]]
    (Extra)Condensed, [[http://www.dafont.com/axehandel.font|AxeHandel]] (rough, /R
    off but nice overall design)'

  body: "Not a coincidence. Sonia and I have been trying to identify the typefaces
    in this 1940's New York photograph by the brilliant Rudy Burckhardt. Many of his
    images contain hand-painted billboards with wonderful typography.\r\nHis work
    represents a great overview of type in that period.\r\nThanks from both of us
    for the great info.\r\n\r\n"
