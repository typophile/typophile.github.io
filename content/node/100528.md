  human operators using robotic devices. I'm using a lot of \"he or she\", \"s/he\"
  or whatnot to obey the Political correctness police. I've summarized why I feel
  kind of sour about this issue on our TeX and friends Q&A site TeX.SE. The link to
  my question is\r\n\r\nhttp://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/97429/a-ligature-for-she-he\r\n\r\nIn
  one of the comments, I've been adviced to consult your expertise on this issue.
  I'm not replicating the thread here to keep this simple but I would like to ask
  about your opinion on how I should proceed. \r\n\r\nMy excuses at the outset for
  my mediocre attempts :)\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nAnd using this opportunity, I
  invite you also join us and share your expertise on TeX.SE too \r\n\r\n(I hope you
  don't take this as a promotional statement but we have a quite friendly community

    not really sure the third one works; I quite like the first, but it would really
    depend on how skilfully executed it is.  \r\n\r\nThe second one (possibly the

  body: Since the human operator, in the context of your thesis, is a literary construct,
    my inclination is to give her a personality, however minimal, and assume a specific
    sex. Heck, you could even give her a name. This can be explained by a very short
    note at the beginning of the text, and thereafter you can refer to her by a sex-appropriate
    pronoun.

    one thing; after seeing the comments here and in TeX.SE I think I'll just go with
    the \"he\" and don't bother with it unless somebody slaps me in a conference or
    something (I don't think anybody would read it anyway but you know how it goes
    right ?). \r\n\r\nAnyways the starting point for me was first checking the Unicode
    lists and look for gender related ones. I've found out that U+26A6 and U+26A7
    \ (\u26A7 and \u26A6) means in some context transgender and whatnot stuff. So
    I thought instead of this one can also find a nice ligature, as \u221B is much
    better than typing out cubic root all the time or \xBD instead of 1/2 etc. \r\n\r\nTrust

    one can use in some contexts, but sometimes nothing but a clearly inclusive pronoun
    will do.  For example, when I make handouts for students, I wouldn't want anyone
    to get a subtle message that they don't really count, and I want to implement
    that policy in every sentence--alternating won't do.   "They" works sometimes,
    but I want to encourage good grammatical usage too ....  There are a variety of
    proposed alternative pronouns (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_pronoun#Modern_alternatives_to_gender-neutral_pronoun),
    but few of my students would have any idea what they meant.  I was the person
    who suggested typophile.com to percusse, and as you can see, I'm very interested

    alien to a general audience. So, in practice, these are only ever used by people
    who identify outside the gender binary, and really only among each other.\r\n\r\nInstead,
    there has been a natural rise in acceptance of the singular \"they\", which has
    a lot more precedent in historical use than one would expect. Grammar prescriptivists
    may recoil, but it's how people actually talk.\r\n\r\nA good writer can skirt
    the problem entirely, rewriting sentences to employ \"one\", passive voice, a

      the answer would be: Of course not.  If I resented inclusive language, I would
      just use \"he\".  No one is policing that aspect of my writing.  I do care about
      communication, rhythm, flow, and awkward phrasing, in addition to making all
      readers feel welcome.  (Sometimes the right typeface helps.)   I use rephrasing
      to avoid pronouns, I use \"she or he\", etc., but these methods involve tradeoffs,
      and sometimes are less than optimal.  I use \"they\", but don't like it, despite
      historical precedent.  Once in a while it's even ambiguous.  Any composition
      of standard pronouns such as \"s/he\" or \"he or she\" is not fully inclusive,
      either.  I agree that the novel pronouns are impractical outside of small communities,
      but perhaps that will change, eventually.   percusse asked an interesting typographical
      question, in any event; it seems worth exploring possible answers.\r\n\r\nI
      agree that the dollar sign in \"$he\" has potential to be inappropriately suggestive,
      although in multiple respects; what gets subtly suggested, if anything, will
      depend on the reader and context.  It's a simple solution despite this.  The
      he/she fraction may be better.\r\n\r\n(my 2/100 of a $)\r\n\r\n\r\n(When $^{\\mbox{\\scriptsize

    or she\"? My answer is yes. It shouldn't be a problem which pronoun I might have
    chosen. But it was there when I've arrived. Heh.\r\n\r\nAvoiding these pronouns
    seems more problematic to me because then you kind of accept the fact that this
    is a genuine problem which is not from my point-of-view.  I sincerely don't believe
    this would equate man woman inbalance. For me it's just childish complain to rant
    about \"man on the moon\" etc. especially people know exactly what the context
    is. But anyway, that's another story.\r\n\r\nAlso I was thinking that this must
    have come up in a legal context and similar cases where every pronoun means something
    particularly important so \"he or she\" written consecutively n times should have
    pushed people to come up with a solution already but I guess not. \r\n\r\nIf you
    are interested, alternating he/she automatically is possible for LaTeX users via
    a package written by Alan Munn. You can find the link in the TeX.SE question.

    body: My feeling about this issue of what pronouns to use is that in practice,
      there are subtle influences on our thinking that come and go and interact with
      other aspects of social life.  We can say that using exclusively male pronouns
      is meant to include women as well, and that is one tradition that has been handed
      down to us.  In practice, though, I think that this practice subtly or not-so-subtly
      influences cognitive processes so as to suggest that men count, men are included,
      and women aren't.  I think that when <em>I</em> read "he", what comes to mind
      is a man.  I think this happens to most people at least some of the time, and
      we don't even notice it.   I am not trying to please some "political correctness"
      police.  I think there is a real effect of using only male pronouns, and it
      helps support thought processes that views women as less able to contribute
      to society.  I don't think that that idea--that women are less able to contribute--is
      objectively true.  I think women and men can contribute equally, sometimes in
      different ways, on average, but sometimes in the same ways.   In addition that,
      there are people who are neither clearly male or female--that's who they are,
      and that's OK.  They should not feel less able to contribute either.  Society
      benefits from diversity of contributions.   So I'm in favor of gender-neutral
      pronouns, in the abstract.  As it happens, there is not an ideal solution for
      communication of gender-neutrality at this time.

  body: "My proposed solution to this now to be former problem is both linguistic
    and typographical conjointly.\r\n\r\nFor my typographical solution, see image
    \"DKheSheLigaturePictureTwoLineJPEG\", which contains a ligature of the letters
    S and H, with the initial of the pronoun either lower case or capitalised as upper
    case. Since ligatures are often discretionary, this proposal should hardly be
    considered unconventional. The versions shown here are based on the Libertine
    open source font. To Original Poster, this font should be familiar to your TeX
    application.\r\n\r\nMy linguistic solution, which I thought of several years ago,
    is to take the third person plural pronouns, which never specify gender, and convert
    them to neutral animate singular pronouns by changing the first phoneme from the
    voiced dental or interdental fricative in the plural pronoun to the unvoiced or
    voiceless dental or interdental fricative in the singular. \r\n\r\nBut for the
    third person singular subject neutral animate pronoun, in addition its vowel could
    be pronounced the same as for the corresponding masculine and feminine pronouns
    \"he\" and \"she\", rather than as in the plural pronoun \"they\", in order to
    emphasize that it is to be singular rather than plural. \r\n\r\nSince the phonetic
    distinction between the voiced and unvoiced phonemes is not large, it would be
    acceptable to pronounce the initial phonemes unvoiced in the pronouns that I propose
    in ordinary speech without sounding too strange. Possibly, the listener would
    not even notice without paying attention, yet would still understand. I recommend
    that you may test this in conversation with your friends and colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason that I base these third person singular neutral animate pronouns on the
    third person plural pronouns is that those plural pronouns are nowadays routinely
    used for gender-neutral contexts, even where to do so would be ungrammatical.
    Hence, to use my suggested pronouns instead would be in accordance with modern
    practice, yet would avoid being ungrammatical.\r\n\r\nNote also that the third
    person singular neutral animate pronoun should be conjugated with singular rather
    than plural verbs. \r\n\r\nThe reason that I use the unvoiced rather than voiced
    initial phoneme is that the initial phonemes of the singular masculine and feminine
    pronouns are unvoiced or voiceless.\r\n\r\nThe unvoiced dental or interdental
    phoneme can be represented in spelling using the Old English letter thorn \xFE,
    as I have shown in the table (see image \"DK3rdPersonPronounsTableJPEG\"). To
    use my linguistic solution in conjunction with the typographical approach, simply
    substitute that letter thorn by the ligatures that I have designed.\r\n\r\nIn
    order to remind the reader to pronounce the initial phoneme of the singular pronouns
    unvoiced rather than voiced, it would be acceptable to design the lower case ligatures
    in such a way that they would have descenders to resemble the letter thorn \xFE.
    But the upper case varieties should not have descenders. I have also considered
    italic versions of the ligatures, and these would have a greater propensity to
    imply the forward slant as the oblique stem between the letters S and H. The italic
    version should also have a tendency towards becoming graphically symmetrical,
    but such a glyph would in my ideal system of writing denote a different phoneme
    than the unvoiced dental fricative. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DKheSheLigaturePictureTwoLineJPEG_4924.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DK3rdPersonPronounsTableJPEG_3914.jpg]"

    explanation for this, since the voiced and voiceless versions used to be allophones
    of a single phoneme. (I.e. they were two pronunciations of the same mental sound).

    show us a snippet of your result or progress. \r\n\r\nI may be responsible if
    not all of what I wrote was accessible to everyone. In a future post I may illustrate
    by further examples some of the points that I was explaining. But please forgive
    me if some technicality will be necessary for the sake of brevity in this post.
    I have much more to say, but which I omit for the mean time. \r\n\r\nI also liked
    to hear of the astute observations of Alan Munn that you sent us. I remark on
    his impressions forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe same impression in the lowercase ligature
    has occurred to me. The lowercase ligature could be made to look less like the
    masculine and more like the feminine by extending the swash-like curve for the
    \"s\" leftwards from the stem, and perhaps slightly upwards without gaining the
    full height of an ascender, as, I tell you, it appeared in my original hand-drawn
    design sketches. There is leeway for variation, and font designers or typographers
    could adjust the proportions to preference. Whilst effort should be made to satisfy
    feminists, care should be taken to avoid unintentional connotations. Overt emphasis
    of the female gender to the exclusion of the male should be avoided as that would
    defeat the whole purpose of the ligature, which is to be gender-neutral or mutually
    inclusive. I hasten to add that no particular known identifiable individual person
    should be discussed by anyone else using a neutral pronoun, whether inanimate
    or animate.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be true that all instances of an initial voiced
    dental or interdental fricative in the English language occur in \"function words\",
    this does not imply that all instances of initial unvoiced dental or interdental
    fricatives must by law occur in non-function words. According to the ever-trustworthy
    Wikipedia, ehem,\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_word]]\r\n\"The
    following is a list of the kind of words considered to be function words:\r\n\r\narticles
    \u2014 the and a. In some inflected languages, the articles may take on the case
    of the declension of the following noun.\r\npronouns \u2014 inflected in English,
    as he \u2014 him, she \u2014 her, etc.\r\nadpositions \u2014 uninflected in English\r\nconjunctions
    \u2014 uninflected in English\r\nauxiliary verbs \u2014 forming part of the conjugation
    (pattern of the tenses of main verbs), always inflected\r\ninterjections \u2014
    sometimes called \"filled pauses\", uninflected\r\nparticles \u2014 convey the
    attitude of the speaker and are uninflected, as if, then, well, however, thus,
    etc.\r\nexpletives \u2014 take the place of sentences, among other functions.\r\npro-sentences
    \u2014 yes, okay, etc.\"\r\n\r\nSo if adpositions are function words, then presumably
    prepositions, which belong to the set of adpositions, are function words. The
    word \"through\" is a preposition, but it is pronounced with an initial unvoiced
    rather than voiced dental or interdental fricative. Perhaps, however, one could
    disregard that as an anomaly because the initial phoneme is followed by a rhotic
    one, even though a rhotic phoneme would be voiced by default (although I would
    sometimes pronounce the word \"rhotic\" and certain other words of Greek etymology
    with a voiceless r, such as the letter \"rho\" itself in order to distinguish
    it from the otherwise homophonic words \"row\" and \"roe\"). But this is hardly
    tenable.\r\n\r\nMany phonemes have arisen historically by differentiation of allophones.
    This can happen by dialectal variation (such as the pronunciation of the initial
    phoneme of the words \"which\" and \"whether\" as unvoiced in contrast to voiced
    in their otherwise homophonic words \"witch\" and \"weather\". The pronunciation
    of unvoiced \"wh\" can still be heard today sometimes where I live, even though
    it would violate a rule that sonorant phonemes in English can no longer be unvoiced
    unless by allophonic variation); importation of foreign words (such as the French
    word \"genre\" into English); grammatical inflexion (such as generation of verbs
    from nouns by conversion of final unvoiced dental fricatives to their voiced counterparts,
    as in the verb \"breathe\", whose final phoneme is voiced, from the noun \"breath\",
    whose final phoneme is unvoiced. An example in which there is no other phonetic
    change is with the verb \"loathe\", pronounced with a voiced final, and the adjective
    \"loath\", with unvoiced codal phoneme); or by gradual change. For example, there
    is a tendency in historical linguistics for lenition by increasing sonority of
    unvoiced to voiced, especially intervocalically, that is, medially between two
    vowel phonemes. An allophonic pronunciation should be predictable from the context
    and is not contrastive, such that it is not responsible for the sole phonetic
    difference between any words or morphemes that differ in meaning. But once they
    become true phonemes, their pronunciations cannot necessarily be predicted from
    any prescriptive grammatical rule, though they would still of course be subject
    to allophonic mutation in accordance with the phonological context, such as assimilation
    with the voicing or lack of voice of adjacent phonemes, unless they are themselves
    the trend-setters.\r\n\r\nWe should know that the unvoiced and voiced dental fricatives
    are phonemes in English because the unrelated words \"thy\" and \"thigh\" of different
    meaning differ in sound solely by their initial dental fricatives. You could argue
    that \"thy\" is a function word, but it might be that the dental fricatives are
    voiced in function words because they are old and have been used frequently such
    that they have become voiced by lenition.\r\n\r\nExcuse me if I do not know the
    full textual evidence, but as for the historical linguistic explanation, I would
    have thought that it can be debated whether the voiced and unvoiced versions were
    allophones rather than separate phonemes immediately before the introduction of
    our current orthography. We have no audio recordings of speech from hundreds of
    years ago. Let me argue by a hypothetical scenario as follows. If we today were
    to begin to re-introduce the Old English letters thorn \xFE and eth \xF0, and
    use them for respectively the unvoiced and voiced dental fricatives, as they used
    to be used, and if we further suppose that in some distant time in the future
    all audio recordings that we still have in our present time should be lost or
    destroyed, such as by planned obsolescence if your imagination calls for a reason,
    then it would seem reasonable that people of the future would infer from the textual
    evidence that would remain with them that what to them would be written as two
    separate phonemes used to be written as though they were a single phoneme pronounced
    the same way, by the single digraph, or two letters in combination, \"th\". Therefore,
    the people of the future would deduce that the two phonemes must have arisen by
    differentiation of two allophones of the same phoneme. The same kind of argument
    can be extended to our past. Regard much of this paragraph as somewhat tongue-in-cheek.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I am saying is to ponder whether it is possible that there were at some time in
    the past two phonemes, one voiced and the other unvoiced, but that the phonemic
    distinction was forgotten or lost to some extent because of the removal of the
    Old English letters thorn and eth by the Normans, who seemed to favour only the
    Latin alphabet (They also removed the two other non-Latin letters wynn and yogh
    that were useful). Consider the second verse stanza of the poem Beowulf. How else
    would you explain \"sy\xF0\xF0an \xE6rest wear\xF0\"; \"o\xF0\xFE\xE6t\"; and
    \"\xDE\xE6t w\xE6s god cyning\" and all of the other examples?\r\n\r\nIn summary,
    phonemes can arise from allophones, but they can also merge and be lost. The process
    happens both ways in the evolution of language, which is not constrained to obey
    any etymological rationalisation and theoretical categorisation. The deep lexical
    relationship that you raise may have been caused orthographically by Norman vandalism
    to the Old English alphabet."
