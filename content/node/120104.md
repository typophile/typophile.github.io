  I'd like to know which font is used in these labels of Piero Manzoni's art pieces.
  Both the light and the bold one...\r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance\r\n\r\nCarlo

    light one: I'd probably choose some geometric sans like [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]]\r\n-
    bold one: probably a [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/din|DIN]]"

  body: "You're right, not so inspiring suggestions :)\r\nDIN might work unless we
    could see a more detailed /G. Futura would work as well until you have to type
    /M...\r\nMay I suggest a different approach now? Piero Manzoni was an Italian
    artist of the late 50's early 60's period. May be it'd interesting to re-focus
    your search on typefaces used on this time-period (which I guess excludes DIN
    right away) and/or in Italy (assuming these art pieces were crafted there)."

  body: "I second the DIN suggestion, but would refine it to DIN Neuzeit Grotesk (for
    the middle and right):\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/din_30640_neuzeit_grotesk_std_light/ot_ps/specimen/tester/\r\n\r\nBold
    condensed of the same font for the label on the left.\r\n\r\nThe original version
    of this typeface was designed in 1928 by Wilhelm Pischner for the D. Stempel Foundry,
    and was a staple of the moveable type and photo-lettering eras."

  body: "Agree with Kevin, DIN Neuzeit Grotesk is better DIN candidate but design
    date still remains out of the time-frame.\r\nI like Simplicita, better than Futura
    and more relevant considering the topic."
