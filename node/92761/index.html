  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The image here:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/metamers_of_moby_dick_3908.jpg]</p>
<p>comes from a 2011 <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> paper entitled “Metamers of the Ventral Stream.” The intention is to provide a visualization of <em>representation</em> of printed text in the periphery.</p>
<p>In “Peripheral vision and pattern recognition: A review,” (<em>Journal of Vision</em> 2011), Hans Strasburger, et. al., write: “It is commonly thought that blurriness of vision is the main characteristic of [“seeing sidelong”]. Yet [Jerome] Lettvin [“On Seeing Sidelong,” <em>The Sciences</em>, 1976] […] insisted that any theory of peripheral vision exclusively based on the assumption of blurriness is bound to fail: “When I look at something it is as if a pointer extends from my eye to an object. The ‘pointer’ is my gaze, and what it touches I see most clearly. Things are less distinct as they lie farther from my gaze. It is not as if these things go out of focus—but rather it’s as if somehow they lose the quality of form””</p>
<p>In the image the red dot indicates where the ‘pointer’ touches down.</p>
<p>The science behind metamers is explained in the <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> paper available at: <a href="http://www.jeremyfreeman.net/public/downloads/Freeman-Simoncelli-2011-Metamers.pdf">http://www.jeremyfreeman.net/public/downloads/Freeman-Simoncelli-2011-Metamers.pdf</a>. The Strasburger, et. al., paper is at: <a href="http://www.journalofvision.org/content/11/5/13.full.pdf+html">http://www.journalofvision.org/content/11/5/13.full.pdf+html</a>.</p>
<p>In a 2012 (<em>Journal of Vision</em>) paper “A summary statistic representation in peripheral vision explains visual search,”  Ruth Rosenholtz et. al., use this science to generate metamers or mongrels of patches of text or shapes, and to introduce a notion of patch discriminability. Applied to printed text, patch discriminability would translate to Hrant’s notion of bouma divergence. For Rosenholtz, et. al., visual patch discriminability using metamer stimuli predicts ease of visual search. So for our purposes, gauging patch discriminability might help us get a handle on and test the impact of bouma divergence (or optimizing notan) on the parafoveal preview benefit in reading.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to test using metamers of </em>Moby Dick</em> if the kind of manipulations Hrant envisions to enhance bouma divergence yield patches with significantly greater patch discriminability. Whether they do or not, the graphic appears to supply a more telling representation of what visual information is available to parafoveal vision then we&rsquo;ve had until now.</p>
<p>The Rosenholtz paper is here: <a href="http://www.journalofvision.org/content/12/4/14">http://www.journalofvision.org/content/12/4/14</a></p>

<p>On the subject of perception in the periphery, I have a quite good photo of Denis Pelli&rsquo;s final slide from last week&rsquo;s <em>Reading Digital</em> conference, which I will post here once I have confirmed some details of what is shown. It involves a technique developed by one of Denis' grad students to ameliorate the effects of crowding.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>By the way, Jeremy Freeman and Eero P. Simoncelli, the writers of the <em>Metamers</em> paper write: “We envision that our model could be used to optimize fonts, letter spacing or line spacing for robustness to crowding effects, potentially improving reading performance.”</p>
<p>Another dimension of this line of research is that these “seeing sidelong” hypotheses conflict with the conventional interpretations of the results of eye movement studies using the ‘moving window’ and ‘boundary’ technique that claim the reader is gathering <em>letter</em> information in parafoveal preview to facilitate word recognition. Kevin Larson adopted this interpretation to make his case for parallel letter recognition in “The Scince of Word Recognition.”</p>
<p>The most we could probably say is that the reader is gathering summary statistics pooled over multi-letter patches from parafoveal preview to facilitate word recognition and control eye movements and skipping.</p>

This photograph shows Denis explaining work done by one of his grad students, who used eye-tracking and software to reduce constrast of text outside the immediate context of fixations (indicated by the red dot), and hence reduce crowding effect on word recognition in the near parafovea. I don&rsquo;t recall the exact result, but there was a significant improvement in reading speed among test subjects.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Good question. Might there be a an impact on saccade cueing, even if there is a net gain in reading speed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure. It could be simply so as to prevent an unfamiliar visual experience in the fixation by maintaining symmetry. But I&rsquo;ve not understood whether there is actually <em>no</em> information gleaned from the left of a fixation during reading. It seems to me that, at least, information from that side of the fixation could be used to confirm reading from the previous fixation or help trigger a regression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m awaiting details, but it seems to me that what matters in the study is relative wpm speeds, not absolute.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I’ve always thought peripheral vision was quantized, rather than uniformly blurry.
I don’t believe distress (the “metamer” shown) is an adequate metaphor, either.
I suggest low res bitmapping.
Speaking of analogies from technology, how about the way the blind spot is ﬁlled in?
Just like Photoshop’s clone tool.
And if one sees the blind spot cloned in that manner, wouldn’t that suggest that there is a huge element of projected meaning shaping the periphery, not just raw interpretation of shapes? So what one “sees” already has a primitive typo-matrix-like form (because the reader is aware of the kind of document being read, so expects a certain kind of text to be in a certain place), assumed to have the fundamental structure of proto-text, not the decayed appearance of processed text.</p>
<p>And why do we assume that the image seen in the fovea is sharp and fully detailed like a photograph? If non-typographers can’t see the difference between Times and Century, why do we represent what they see by a fully-detailed image? Surely we only see what we recognize.</p>
<p>Just because light falls on the retina, doesn’t mean that it becomes information which has to be fully processed. There must be some redundancy built in, to predictively turn off rods and cones deemed irrelevant once a certain amount of semantic closure has occurred.</p>
<p>As Blake observed, if the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear as it is—infinite.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Perhaps the term ‘visualization’ in my initial post was misleading.</p>
<p>In a 1971 paper Herman Bouma introduced a series of shape descriptions of letters around terms focussing on sidedness, expressedness (disturbed or undisturbed; rectangular or round), aspect (oblique or rectilinear), closure (or the lack of it) , extendedness. He did this with an eye on representation in the parafovea.</p>
<p>The metamers are not literal images of representation in the periphery, but statistically representative simulations that show to what degree location, aspect, expressedness, closure (or lack of it) and extendedness are compromised in crowded parafoveal vision.</p>
<p>The  compromise is large enough to inhibit or prevent sufficiently automatic and rapid visual word-form resolution or letter identification to support robust word recognition.</p>
<p>The other side of the decrement is that what (of expressedness, closure, aspect, etc) is preserved seems to be at just the right level of informativeness to facilitate effective saccade planning, and provide a priming-like preview benefit.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, what happens at the retinal level may indeed be akin to low resolution bitmapping, but the metamers show what happens in the ‘ventral stream’ (as the title of the metamer paper indicates).</p>
<p>The ventral stream is the ‘belly’ or bottom part of the brain that includes the visual cortex and what has been dubbed the Visual Word Form Area. (The term Visual Word Form Area is controversial — my working tag for it is Intrinsic Integration Interface — but that&rsquo;s another story).</p>
<p>There is a ‘cortical magnification factor’ as information travels through the visual cortex, which compounds the issues surrounding the coarseness of the representation at the retinal level*, forcing a ‘pooling’ or ‘compulsory averaging’ of featural and positional statistics. The positional uncertainty and structural ambiguities captured in the metamers are the result of the compulsory averaging and pooling.</p>
<p>Since researchers are now able to quantify the degree of pooling, accurate simulations of positional uncertainty and structural ambiguities are available using metamers.</p>
<p>*[adding to clarify] representation at the retinal level is constrained or limited by the lower density of rods and cones than in the fovea.</p>

<p>That is of course the central question. But look what happens to the /y in &ldquo;myself&rdquo; and &ldquo;involuntary&rdquo; in the top image; I would suggest that if the descender terminal (which is in effect a serif - hint, hint) were heftier you might (at least sometimes) end up with at least a blip in the metamer instance, leading to a better bouma. Ergo: timid extenders are dysfunctional.</p>
<p>And I have no doubt that there are deeper guidelines to be formulated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Metamers of Moby Dick — or any other text — in a condensed sans serif font, versus metamers of the same text in a non-condensed version of the same typeface might indicate that patch discriminability is significantly compromised in the condensed, signaling a possible reduced parafoveal preview benefit and a disruption of eye-movement mechanics. Patch discriminability might be compromised, because, for example, the less pronounced obliquity, as in the arms of the x or the legs of the w might make the summary statistics of patches containing these forms less divergent from those that don&rsquo;t, hence less informative.</p>
<p>The predictions could than be tested in the domain of eye-movement and parafoveal preview benefit research, and the results used to give evidential support to our intuitions about typeface selection for extended texts. It might also become possible to <em>plot</em> the ratio of condensation to the disruption of the parafoveal preview benefit and optimal eye-movement mechanics.</p>
<p>The effect of serifs on patch discriminability could also be looked at.</p>
<p>So no direct formula to delineate particularly effective letterforms, but contextual knowledge about what kind of manipulations have what sort of effect, and in what part of the reading process.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Peter: <em>…the metamers show what happens in the ‘ventral stream’</em></p>
<p>But how do they show it? They look like a real image and not enough like a diagram—homunculism. They are a picture impersonating a diagram (or is it vice versa?), and will be interpreted as what peripheral vision “really” looks like.</p>
<p>They are a piece of graphic design (see the method quoted below) which may be able to simulate experimental results. But are they any less of a metaphor than simple blurring?</p>
<p>They are misleading, because they are high res. They (and the other grunged-up photos) lend allure to the research, but they are somewhat of a misrepresentation, because even scientists who read and understand the paper will nonetheless think that this is what the retinal ﬁeld of vision looks like, when in fact <em><strong>it doesn’t look like anything!</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>“Synthetic images were then generated by initializing them with samples of Gaussian white noise and iteratively adjusting them (using a variant of gradient descent) until they matched the model responses of the original image (see Online Methods).”</blockquote>
<p>I assume that blurring was also used to bring the noised image back to a consistent resolution across the entire image (why?).</p>
<p>This is a fairly common Photoshop technique: ﬁrst you distress the image in a rough and graphic manner, then you smooth it so that it looks more naturalistic. A gradient mask blends the ﬁltered selection into the rest of the image. It may be used in retouching skin, for instance, to tone down blemishes.</p>
<p>There are several deconstructed typefaces, mostly designed in the early 1990s, that might also be considered to represent what happens in the ventral stream, but with a degree of simple formality in their distress. Types such as Arbitrary Sans suggest an alternative en-masse effect to the trope of this research, which reminded me of this from <em>Casablanca</em>:</p>

<p>The danger of [metaphysical and empirical] homunuculism is always there in theories of representation. This fed the representationalist / anti-representationalist debate in cognitive science sparked by Hubert Dreyfus’s and Tim Van Gelder in the early years of AI.

<p>Homunculism isn’t a danger that might happen, it’s an inescapable paradox of optical science that shows images which map the ﬁeld of vision.</p>
<p>I criticized Freeman et al.’s images from the perspective of an artist/designer, for being too naturalistic.
It seems to me that the graphic process/metaphor they have designed/chosen (“feathered” ﬁltering), which processes a high-res typographic image, could be improved upon.</p>
<p>Their overall premise starts with Lettvin’s remarkable insight that emergent images <em>acquire</em> the quality of form, in which case generating parafoveal representations by distressing <em>already</em> fully realized Garamond is wrong.</p>
<p>In dealing with type, researchers have an advantage over photographs of natural scenes, because the semantics of typographic imagery are pre-formatted in a manner familiar to test subjects.</p>
<p>That is why I’m proposing that, rather than the blurry, rainy-window effect, it might be useful to represent peripheral type by something like Arbitrary Sans which looks or is partly or emergently formed, rather than post-facto distressed.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that there is something fractal happening, in the relationship between categoric shapes as they are perceived in the centre of vision, and the periphery. The design question is, how could parametric typefaces best be used to represent the visual process? (And make no mistake, this research is also graphic design.)</p>
<p>What are the alternatives to Photoshopping bitmapped Garamond, or simple Beowolf-style data-driven disruption of form?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The name Arbitrary Sans is a clue, suggesting that the letter forms are not fully resolved, which is indeed the case.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arbitrary_5605.png]
In the /a for instance, the lower right terminal is decisively rendered, but it appears to be neither quite big enough for a typical curled serif in that position, nor is it the subtle splaying of the vertical stem that is another standard treatment. It is deliberately indecisive with regard to the reader’s expectation. Protean, even.</p>
<p>This form therefore corresponds to Lettvin’s “I don’t exactly know but I’m beginning to get an idea” process of deciphering which underlies the research being discussed.</p>
<p>With this principle, text in different areas of the ﬁeld of vision could be represented by parametric variants of a typeface, quantitatively deployed.</p>
