  body: "\"angry young computer\" seems to be a grotesque. The 1985 Phil's Photo \"Homage
    to the Alphabet\" book shows something called California Grotesque which is similar
    in feel, but not the details of the descenders (the g is the wrong kind, and the
    y tail isn't as upturned). [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/grotesque-no-9/|Grotesque
    No.9]] shows some of these features, but the weight isn't right. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atfiedler-gothic-bold/|Fielder
    Gothic Bold]] shows one surviving member of what was a large family with varying
    widths and details in the days of phototypes.\r\n\r\nIn the 60's phototypes were
    widely used, and gothics/grotesques came in every imaginable variation or weight,
    widths and letterform  feature (r curve, g tail, a tail, y tail, c closure). That
    means that finding the same typeface in digital font format is probably unlikely.
    You can search using grotesque or gothic condensed and find many of today's equivalent
    styles.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    of New York from the 1960s. My understanding is that California Grotesk was a
    derivative. The alternate l/c \"g\" looks to be a custom variation, I would have
    to pull the original film out of storage to check. Not digitized.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a page from the specimen book[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SquareGrotesk50series_6269.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    Burroughs Corporation mark looks custom drawn.\r\n\r\n"
