  body: Hard to say, very small and blurry, many details are missing. That could be
    a lot of things (Futura, Avenir, Freight Sans...) but as they're using [[http://myfonts.us/td-Z5UIhO|Corbel]]
    on their website so may be they simply use the same. So part of providing a better
    sample, I guess it will be hard to find a match.
