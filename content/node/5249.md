body: I&#39;m doing sort of a plundering :-&#41; of online &#40;and I guess even offline&#41;
  tutorials that explain how to make pixelfonts &#40;outline fonts that use blocks
  to render pixels at a given PPEM&#41;. I know such tutorials have been discussed
  before, but some searches through Typophile were more distracting than helpful...
  So any links would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    <BR> <BR>The previous link includes a link to a mirror of Matthew Bardram&#39;s
    long-lost tutorial: <BR><a href="http://www.ultrashock.com/ff.htm?http://ultrashock.com/tutorials/flash5/fonttutorial.html"

    <BR>I wonder if they have his permission? <BR> <BR>There are more ways to skin
    this cat than are listed here. As you know, Chris at <a href="http://ultrafonts.com/"
    target="_blank">UltraFonts</a> has developed his own very clever &#40;and patented?&#41;
    method in-house. For <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/rastergotcond.html"
    target="_blank">the pixel fonts I released last year</a>, I developed some methods
    myself based somewhat on Bardram&#39;s methods. At TypeCon2003, Craig Kroeger
    of <a href="http://miniml.com/index.html" target="_blank">Miniml</a> demonstrated
    his method, which used some techniques I hadn&#39;t seen before &#40;similar to
    the first tutorial above&#41;. The <a href="http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=unibody&amp;id2=overview"
    target="_blank">Underware</a> people seem to use yet another method &#40;lots
    of individual boxes with slight gaps between them&#41;. And, of course, there
    is FontLab&#39;s <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/fontflasher.html" target="_blank">FontFlasher</a>,
    which I have, but haven&#39;t had time to investigate much. Last and possibly
    least, there is <a href="http://www.kgroup.ru/products.html" target="_blank">PixFont</a>.
    <BR> <BR>One method I&#39;ve noticed that is particularly clever, and is used
    by several developers, is making it so the font size is always 8 point, regardless
    of the actual size of the font. This is particularly useful to Windows users because
    they have to overcome the fact that Flash assumes 72 dpi while other programs
    assume 96 dpi. &#40;On Macs, everything is 72 dpi, so this is not an issue.&#41;
    So, you use 8 point in Flash and 6 point in other apps. If the base size was 10
    point, then you would have to use 7.5 point in other apps, which may not be allowed.
    Anyway, it makes life simpler for Windows users wanting to use the fonts outside
    of Flash. &#40;I wish I&#39;d known this when I created my pixel fonts. I should
    probably change them to use this method, but so far I&#39;ve had no complaints.&#41;'

  body: Yeah, that recent special type issue of CA had something by one Cal Henderson.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; The Underware people  <BR> <BR>What bugs me about that is that
    the gaps can fall apart during the inevitable &#34;discretization&#34; onscreen
    at certain &#40;larger-than-intended&#41; sizes. It seems like a quickie way of
    doing it. <BR> <BR>BTW, Chris&#39;s method &#40;which also uses 8 point exclusively&#42;&#41;
    is much more than clever - it&#39;s genial. Not only does it do gray, but it&#39;s
    automated. All will be told during their workshop on Thursday PM at TypeCon...
    <BR> <BR>&#42; One nice thing about this is that the user doesn&#39;t need to
    know what PPEM the font is &#40;except for predicting exact leading needs&#41;,
    so you don&#39;t have to put that in the name! <BR> <BR>When you have a chance
    to review FontFlasher do let us know the results! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: <i>...it&#39;s automated.</i> <BR> <BR>That&#39;s what I meant when I said
    it was clever. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s nice that the FontLab folks created FontFlasher
    for FontLab, but I would have been much happier if they had done something similar
    for their BitFonter. I also wish they would make BitFonter run native in OS X
    &#40;as I&#39;m sure others would like to see it run on Windows&#41;. BitFonter
    would seem to be the most natural tool for creating pixel fonts, but it can&#39;t
    &#40;not directly at least&#41;.

  body: Mark, we are testing BitFonter 2 right now. It will have FontFlasher-style
    export &#40;directly to FontLab trough plugin interface&#41; and of course, it
    works natively in OS X. Has kerning editor for our Photofonts too :-&#41;
