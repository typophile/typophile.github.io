body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Finally, I got myself together
  and now I&#39;m posting one of my designs for critique. The story so far: The company
  &#34;Paldin Holiday&#34; wanted a logo design. They operate a significant number
  of hotels and resorts. The task was described like this - &#34;we want something
  that would appeal to rich European customers. We like to show that we have hotels
  &amp; resorts not only on the Bulgarian Black Sea, but also in the Rhodopes Mountains,
  various ski resorts &amp; hotels&#34;. PALDIN is an old Roman name for my city,
  Plovdiv - but wanted me to stay away of the Roman element. That was okay for me,
  so I did something rather expected: <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53262.gif"
  alt="Logo 01"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53263.gif"
  alt="Logo 2"> <BR> <BR>Then, after a month of silence, they appeared and said: &#34;you
  know what - funny, but the real estate business exploded enormously, so now we&#39;re
  not only build and rent hotels, but also sell appartments. We love what we see so
  far, but could you incorporate some &#34;real estate&#34; element in the current
  suggestions. And they look like a travel agency&#34;. I pollitely told them: what
  do you expect , with HOLIDAY in the company name? Okay I&#39;ll see what I can do
  <BR> <BR>As you all see, those designs wouldn&#39;t allow me to add some sort of
  building, house or similiar symbol. So I started all over again: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53264.gif"
  alt="Logo BIG"> <BR> <BR>or  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53265.gif"
  alt="Logo 4"> <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;m wondering, would they understand the last one,
  the roof shape that&#39;s being formed by the 3 squares... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m open
  for suggestions &amp; comments. Thanks in advance&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: Ivan, this is where you need a marketing man to help you explain that you
    can&#39;t stick 10lbs of s_ _ _ _ in a five pound bag. If someone is looking for
    hotel properties or resort properties they probably aren&#39;t looking for real
    estate as well. I think either two logos will do it or they need to change the
    name to something that sounds like a holding company like Paldin Inc. The word
    Holiday looses its meaning.

    shape that&#39;s being formed by the 3 squares... &#34; <BR> <BR>You don&#39;t
    need to understand a logo for it to be an effective mark. The logotype clearly
    states, in writing &#39;hotels, resorts, real estate&#39; so I think the roof
    angle, while nice, isn&#39;t really necessary...it&#39;s just a nice &#39;aha!&#39;
    when you explain it to them.'

  body: 'I think that you are using too many colors on your logotype&#40;4&#43;&#41;
    and I don&#39;t really like the typeface you are using. You should work on the
    illustrations. I hardly see the mountains and the house looks more like a doggy
    shack to me. <BR>  Of the variations you gave the one with the circles have most
    appeal. <BR>  You can also try to make the symbols a bit smaller. <BR>If I am
    to compare the disigns : the ones that you made a month ago and the recent designs,
    I would surely choose the recent ones. <BR> <BR>Salute, Ivan <BR>&#40;i uspeh

  body: Thanks everybody, for the feedback. My main concern about the second set of
    designs is that they may look a bit like and information signs, rather than a
    logo. I would love to design a wordmark only, and lose all the symbols. But hey
    - the company I&#39;m working for is not Kioken and we can&#39;t afford to &#34;fire
    clients&#34;, like they did with Sony.  <BR>Galin is right for the colour usage...I
    should see how all these symbols would look in a single or 2 colour scheme. <BR>  <BR>Now
    I&#39;m waiting for them to decide.
