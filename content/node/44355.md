  beyond easy repair. We don't understand why fontlab would distort the vectors to
  begin with.\r\n\r\nfor example.. certain nodes along a curves will kink or be thrown
  into a wrong curve projection, distorting the character completely.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_6496.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf

  we feel more at home with Illustrator's drawing capabilities."

  body: "I am pretty sure other explanations might follow, but to give it a reasonable
    start..\r\n\r\nScaling problem as well as distortion of vectors:\r\n\r\nBefore
    you start drawing your letterforms in Illustrator, activate \"snap to grid\" (view)
    and create/set up a grid from within the preferences menu.\r\n\r\nIn the pref.
    menu set a grid line e.g. every 50pt with a subdivision of 50 as well. \r\n\r\nDepending
    on the subdivisions you like to see and use you can make a finer or coarsar grid,
    eg. a grid line every 100pt with subdivisions every 10points.\r\n\r\nAs a result
    you will be able to set your bezier points/nodes actually on the grid and not
    somewhere in between. \r\n\r\nSince a glyph will be 1000pt x 1000pt correlating
    to the UPM glyph size in Fontlab you have pretty much possibilities to set a node..\r\n\r\nWhen
    you work without a grid and you import your vectors to Fontlab your nodes might
    get rearranged since they were slightly off position.\r\n\r\nAnd here we are concerning
    the scaling..\r\n\r\nIf you then define the baseline, descender/ascender-height
    and x-heigth make sure to achieve 1000pt. E.g. -250 descender, 600 x-height, 150
    ascender.. \r\n\r\nNow you can import your glyphs in Fontlab immediately in the
    correct size, no need for rescaling..\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe way I would do it:\r\n\r\n-
    Set up a grid (50pt grid line / 50 subdivisions) and make sure to activate \"snap
    to grid\"..\r\n\r\n- Create a second layer and set up baseline, descender/ascender-height
    and x-heigth as thin coloured lines horizontally across the whole canvas.. pretty
    much the same layout you would have in Fontlab.\r\n\r\n- draw the glyph..\r\n\r\n-
    define a shortcut action that a) copies the current glyph b) pastes the glyph
    c) puts the glyph to the coordinates x0,y0 (reference point should be bottom left)
    d) cuts the glyph to the clipboard again..\r\n\r\nWhen a glyph is finished, click
    it an run the action, go into Fontlab, open the corresponding glyph and hit paste
    (command+v). The glyph will then sit at the correct place with the correct size.\r\n\r\n-
    -\r\n\r\nWhen you decide to draw your glyphs in Illustrator, familiarize yourself
    with the different aspects you have to keep mind to actually use the workflow
    (you might have developed in Illustrator) to your advantage.\r\n\r\nSome will
    ask, why not draw your glyphs directly in Fontlab?\r\n\r\nI really hope, my explanation
    will clear up some aspects :)\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards, Steffen\r\n\r\n"

  body: thanks steffen, your reply was a great help, though a few more questions...
    we have been using a grid and snapping to it. our more geometric letterforms translate
    fine, but our letterforms that resemble more organic yet sans serif faces such
    as helvetica or univers are the ones distorting. we even tried using univers in
    illustrator, converting to outlines, then copying it into fontlab, and it still
    distorts.. mind you this is a face that is already well designed/thought out by
    professional foundries. we seem to think that certain vectors that may be more
    complex are hard for fontlab to translate. we may or may not be right.. just a
    thought.

  body: "btw, concerning the scaling issue:\r\n\r\nyou could always look at the height
    of your letters (from descender till caps height/ascender), devide 1000 by your
    height to get a number x. then when you build up an action similar to the one
    i described earlier, multiply your glyph by x somewhere in the routine.\r\n\r\nof
    course it would be more helpful and precise to actually draw the glyphs at their
    original intented sizes. in case you rund out of canvas space (which eventually
    will happen) create layers..\r\n\r\nregards again\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I use the same procedure of creating in Illustrator and pasting into FontLab.
    I do it all the time, and not once have I seen distortion as severe as the image
    you included. Small tweaks are all I ever need to make. This leads me to think
    you could make improvements in your method of drawing in Illustrator. Can you
    show what the original letters looked like, and where you placed the bezier nodes
    in Illustrator?\r\n\r\nAs for scaling, it's easy. If you use the standard 1000
    units, with 700 units for cap height, you can draw a 700 unit box in FontLab (from
    the cap height line to the baseline), and paste it into Illustrator. It gives
    you a box with a height of 9.7222. Take something like an H and scale it up to
    that height. Take note of the percentage, and use it to scale the entire set of
    glyphs at the same time. Now you can paste them into FontLab and they will be
    the correct size and in proportion to one another. If you're starting a new project
    in Illustrator, build it with the cap height of 9.7222 in mind and you won't need
    to scale at all."

    correct small details in FontLab afterwards, so there is really no point in doing
    that unless you absolutely refuses to learn to master FontLab bezier curves.\r\nMost
    people I know, who had crossed from Illustrator to FontLab realize after a couple
    of weeks/months that drawing in FontLab is SO much easier, and better \u2013 and
    that it saves SO much time.\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: "Two things to keep in mind:\r\n\r\nFIrst: 1 point in Illustrator = 1 em unit
    in FontLab*\r\n\r\nSecond: In Illustrator, the coordinate space is accurate to
    1/1000 of a point, while in FontLab, the em unit is the smallest possible unit\r\n\r\nIn
    effect, when you paste art from Illustrator into FontLab, the coordinates of the
    nodes are rounded to the nearest whole point first. This is what causes the distortion.
    To minimize the distortion, scale your art up in Illustrator beforehand so that
    1 point corresponds to 1 em unit (basically, what others have advised above).\r\n\r\n*
    Unless you change the EPS import settings in Preferences, and I wouldn't unless
    you know what you are doing."
