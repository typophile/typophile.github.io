    the &, for me should be much more conventional. I know that the Ampersand is an
    \"valid Et\""

  body: "Hi Rui,\r\n\r\nI have 2 thoughts:  I find this looks too close to Neo Sans.
    It also reminds me of other square sans designs like Apex, Amplitude and Stainless.
    Which brings me to my second thought: There are so many square sans designs out
    there. It's a saturated area in type. \r\n\r\nAlso: The more mechanical a typeface
    looks, the more anonymous and undifferentiated I find it. Is there something really
    fresh or distinctive you can do with this? Right now it doesn't seem like it has
    its own identity. "

  body: "Yes, your right. I know from the start is not anything new, but i've been
    wanting to make a font like this for a while. I guees it more a question of resqueing
    an old design.\r\nwell, thanks:)"

  body: "Hi,\r\nI quite like this. With all the other modern sans designs out there,
    it might not be easy to make it a commercial success, but perhaps that's not the
    reason you are making this.\r\nI like this ampersand, its forms and proportions
    are neat.\r\nFor me, the D and N are a bit wide. I wonder if the bottom right
    leg of the k could be chopped like the top (not horizontal ending). I think the
    tail of the Q could move right a bit?\r\nj might need a longer base. y looks too
    narrow and needs more space, and the brackets () too thin and pointy (this kind
    of tapering is not seen in any other glyph).\r\nI like the @.\r\nJust some ideas...see
    what you think :)"

  body: "Very nice. Your ampersand is quite like the Linotype Univers ampersand with
    its very definite horizontal bar. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't worry too much about this
    being a very saturated market, unless you earn a living from it it is just nice
    to craft something you can be proud of. I particularly like the curved base on
    the lowercase 'v' and 'w'. I can see this working really well in a corporate situation
    as it is very distinctive without being over-bearing."
