body: "Over the last year, I have received many requests asking if I plan to expand
  on Contax Pro.\r\n\r\nWell, I'm happy to release today, Contax Sans, a new geometric
  sans family of fonts based on my original design of Contax grotesque.\r\n\r\nSimilar
  yet different. A more delicate and elegant interpretation, with subtle detail in
  terminals and with thick and thin stem variations reminiscent of Hermann Zapf's
  \"Optima\" family of fonts. I hope you like it.\r\n\r\nIn order to make my fonts
  more affordable, I offer the regular and italic free, and I have decided to cut
  my prices in half going forward.\r\n\r\nYou can go to the links below to view and
  download your free fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-sans/\r\n\r\nThere
  is also a promotion for 50% Off on my Contax Pro family of fonts, during the holidays,
  till January 7th.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro/\r\n\r\nThank
  you & have a happy holiday.\r\n"

    regular and italic versions it shows as $0 in the main section, but as $19.50
    in my cart."

    includes the roman & italic free)\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-sans/55-regular/buy.html\r\n\r\nThere
    does appear to be a glich on Myfonts with the single Contax Sans regular.\r\n\r\nI
    will look into it and resolve soon. Thank you for the info."
