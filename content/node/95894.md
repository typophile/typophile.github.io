    name before the period should be a standard character name. However, anything
    after the period is totally up to you. Whatever makes most sense to you and works
    with your development tools is all that's required."

  body: It is also possible to write "a.smcp_ss01". Most of the time in my workflow,
    new letterforms belong to a particular OT feature and can be named after it. The
    rest of the time one can pretty much get by with "alt" (or for pseudo-random features,
    numbered alts).

  body: "I did face the same question months ago while developing a [[http://typophile.com/node/67787|very
    large font]] with dozens of alternative glyphs. After some tries, I built a schema
    combining suffixes when needed:\r\n\r\nCase groups: <strong>.uc, .sc</strong>
    and <strong>.pc</strong>\r\nDesign alternative: <strong>.da</strong>\r\nLinguistic
    alternative: <strong>.la</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen using two suffixes, the last one
    is always the case as it represents the larger group. In other words, the name
    goes from the more specific to the more general (glyph > variation > case).\r\n\r\nThus
    a regular small caps a is <em>a.sc</em> while an alternative design for the same
    letter is <em>a.da.sc</em>. A special character with locale variation would be
    <em>uniXXXX.la</em> and the petite caps variant for this is named <em>uniXXXX.la.pc</em>.\r\n\r\nTo
    save room for long names I use just two letters in each suffix, no matter if the
    related OT feature uses four characters.\r\n\r\nFor number groups I use a letter
    for case [<strong>u, s, p, o</strong>] and a letter for the spacing criteria [<strong>p</strong>roportional/<strong>t</strong>abular].
    This results in <em>.op/.ot</em> for oldstyle proportional/tabular, <em>.pp/.pt</em>
    for petite caps figures and <em>.sp/.st</em> for small caps figures. An alternative
    design (as an open 4 instead of a closed one) receive the .da suffix, resulting
    in .da.op, .da.st and so on.\r\n\r\nAlthough a bit complex at first look, this
    became very handy to manage a large project with multiple groups of glyphs."

    OpenType features have been compiled, they only contain references to glyph <em>indexes</em>.
    Glyph <em>names</em> can be preserved in the 'post' table, but the OT specs do
    not refer to a maximum name length (other than \"a Pascal string\", and I'd have
    to check if this is an 8-bit, 16-bit or even 32-bit number).\r\n\r\n Is this constraint
    a remnant of Ye Olde PostScript Type 1 specs? Constrained for backwards compatibility
    somewhere inside ADFKO?"

  body: Hmm. I did see that somewhere, but I just tested it in FontLab by making a
    very long glyph name, and it still compiled and generated okay. So, maybe that's
    not true, or maybe the limit was changed at some point.

  body: "Yes, the limit is mentioned in <em>Adobe's</em> guides. In the same vein,
    in FontForge:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>If you intend to use feature files, then lookup
    names should be: less than 31 characters [...]</blockquote>\r\n\r\n(Aside: <em>less</em>
    than 31 ... :?)\r\n\r\nThus my thinking it's an ADFKO limit and for Type 1 fonts
    only, not an OpenType one.\r\n\r\nThe backwards-compatibility bit makes sense,
    at least. Inside a Type 1 font, individual glyphs are still indexed by name --
    how quaint!\r\n\r\nUnderlying reason: I'm creating my own Type 1-flavored fonts,
    including necessary OTF code. The latter does *not* force short names, but the
    former does. Since any user supplied glyph names *inside* the font are \"for internal
    usage only\", I probably could cull long names and replace them with a simple
    numeric counter inside the CFF.\r\n(I used to think Adobe InDesign was able to
    show \"custom glyph names\" but somehow that stopped working, or perhaps it never
    did.)"

  body: "Ah, wait a minute. Culling the name interferes with \"name based\" semantic
    lookup:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Even when the original font file is present, glyphs
    which do not match characters in the Unicode specification may still be usefully
    connected to a Unicode character by the glyph name. For example, naming a decorative
    variant of \"t\" as \"t.alt\" allows a PDF producing program to note that \"t.alt\"
    carries the same semantics as \"t\", for searching.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nA reasonable
    scenario.\r\n\r\nAdobe's sample glyph name \"Lcommaaccent_uni20AC0308_u1040C.alternate\"
    is too long, though."
