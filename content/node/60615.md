  all, could somebody please help me identify this font? I'm struggling to find a
  font like it that has a curved right leg of the \"R\" and a straight serif at the
  bottom of this leg. The anpersand appears to be an italic variation, but is it from
  the same font? Could it be an alteration of an existing font? Thanks"
