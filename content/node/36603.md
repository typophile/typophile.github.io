  the exact one- but loved it nonetheless. \r\n\r\nBut the question de jour: Is it
  a font?\r\n\r\nThanks guys,\r\n\r\nMikey :o)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_9_3732.png]"

    those designs and further the right to rename?\r\n\r\n(This doesn't lessen your
    finding abilities Angel, you rock!)"

  body: Yes, QBF is not an outfit anyone could recommend. Sadly they have a handful
    of really old fonts that you can't find anywhere else (except may be Castcraft/Optifont).

  body: "Ahem, don't know how to say this, but there is a freefont(?) called <strong>Oliver</strong>
    done by PrimaFont which looks like this one. \r\n\r\nThe info says Coypright by
    Christine Mauerkirchner und Rainer Grunert, Schwalbach, 1995. And the funny part
    is written in the ReadMe: <em>The PRIMAFONT TYPE LIBRARY is comprised of three
    collections: Classic, Display, and Modern, and contains a total of 1813 characters.
    The Classic Collection is comprised of 1203 <strong>re-cuts of the wellknown \"Berthold\"
    fonts</strong>. The Display collection consists of ornamental and accentuation
    type-cuts, and the Modern Collection  includes a wide variety of modern text type-cuts.
    The PrimaFont Type Library is available in Macintosh as well as in DOS/OS2/Windows
    versions and is pre-formatted for Type 1 and Truetype.</em>\r\n\r\nThe domain
    primafont.de seems to be closed. "
