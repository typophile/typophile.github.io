  body: "Is the numbering equivalent to the next \"2.\" in the sentence? If not, for
    example, because the first '2' is a list (and there is a #1 and a #3), it is possible,
    and provides a visual cue to the reader.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I'd set all numbers
    the same. The connection between Old style figures and lining figures is not the
    same as between capitals and lowercase."

    one would write out numbers fewer than three digits long in text, depending on
    the type of publication.\r\n\r\nBut this is some kind of bibliographic entry,
    isn't it? or some kind of list item? Different rules apply to those."

  body: "theunis: Yes, it is equivalent to the next \"2.\". I don't agree with your
    statement though: lining figures was originally supposed to be used with capitals.\r\n\r\ncuttlefish:
    It reads \"second\" not \"two\" and is from a list of music pieces. The first
    number does not refer to it's place in the list."

  body: "In that case, I'd follow the number by the appropriate ordinal abbreviation
    for the language, though I think those may not apply by custom when referring
    to musical compositions.\r\n\r\nMusical notation, even just text descriptions
    of it, are highly specialized with their own language rules that I'm not familiar
    with."

    supposed to be used with capitals.</cite>\r\n\r\nNot quite right -- or not quite
    complete. Lining figures were designed to be used with all cap settings, as in
    \r\n\r\nFRESH MILK $1.39 A GALLON.\r\n\r\nExcept for a few poets & some typophilers,
    the rest of the world always throws in a few capitals here & there, even when
    generally setting \"lower case\".\r\n\r\nThere are times, in a cap & l.c. setting,
    when you would use lining figures, as with newspaper sections, e.g., C1 -- unless
    you set the \"C\" in small caps.\r\n\r\nBut it is the immediate paring without
    any intervening word space that seems the most determinate factor. I would find
    it odd (and certainly expensive) to use lining figures to begin a sentence. Do
    you also use full caps for an acronym that begins a sentence, if the same acronym
    is set in small caps when it falls in the middle of a sentence? If so, maybe the
    some stylistic logic would also have you set lining figures at the beginning of
    a sentence. I doubt it would result in serious jail time."

  body: "Love that one too, Nick! It's what got me thinking of it. This is a completely
    different setting though. \r\n\r\nI'm not asking specifically for my situation.
    (I was allowed to write it out differently, which I'll prefer doing the next time
    a number ends up there as well.) Just wanted your opinion on the matter."
