  simple, so there's a chance it duplicates some existing work. Proper due diligence
  is to come.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n-symbol-on-white_5183.png]\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts on the mark ? Specifically if it is sufficiently unique and recognizable
  or it it's too generic.\r\n\r\nI have a set of related sketches , I will try and
  upload a bit later on.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlex"

    So when I first saw it I assume the company's initials were IN (or NI), to PN.\r\n\r\nIt's
    very nice, but I'm wondering if it might be confusing, especially since the N
    is the first letter of the second word."

    the 'Precision' is more important than the 'Networking'. Can they change their
    name? Ha. Maybe to 'Integral Networking' or 'Important Networking', just kidding.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a great mark, though I'm not sure it fits 'Precision Networking'."

    the feedback I got outside these forums too.\r\n\r\nAs far as representing the
    Precision part goes the idea was to use sharp edges to do that. Apparently it's
    not obvious from the mark alone.\r\n\r\nLet me post few more versions of the mark
    (later today), perhaps those would work a bit better."

    the visibility of the 'I' in the mark. Additionally the striping is meant to evoke
    an association with a ruler, which in turn is related to something precise.\r\n\r\nThe
    same idea is applied to the bottom two marks, though I'm not sure if the ruler

    you look at that .. I iterated over some other idea and converged to something
    that is quite similar to Hrant's sketch:\r\n\r\nv1\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p-mark_3641.png]

  body: "What about a reverse P flush against a N?\r\n\r\nI have to force myself to
    see a N, which sort of defeats the point. What is their focus, Precision, Networking,
    or Precision Networking? Their mark should be a reenforcing. If you want to use
    the N as the focal point, then you may want to look at a Serif font with bit more
    curvature that allows you to incorporate at the P shape hinting. San-serif offer
    that precision of 90 degree lines, but really that's a big stretch.\r\n\r\nAs
    for why Penguin Books' logo is successful is because the Penguin is usually printed
    on a book, thus you don't really need to reiterate the book aspect of the book.
    When you see them as a sponsor of an event, I believe they have the Penguin logo
    with their name spelled out as well."

    also readable. It's simply great. Maybe it does lack some precision, but that
    can be achieved as well.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

    the final revision of the original N-based mark is this (sorry about small raster
    version):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scaled-n-mark_5788.png]\r\n\r\nIt
    is light, simple, symmetrical and it also implies a ruler, which captures the
    'precision' part of the name. \r\n\r\nWhile I am quite proud of it, it is kind
    of hard to work with because of the unbound negative space on both sides of it.
    So I have ultimately decided against using it and go with a wordmark instead.
    I'll post it separately in a bit.\r\n\r\n@litera: P+n <em>is</em> a deliciously
    simple mark, I agree with you :-) It'd be a shame not to recycle it for some other
    project."
