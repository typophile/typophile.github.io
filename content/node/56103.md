  he mentioned/showed a font I'm curious about. I took notes, but now can't find this
  anywhere. Maybe you guys have some pointers?\r\n\r\nThis is what I know:\r\n\u2013
  The font is optimized for especially small sizes; it's a pretty wide, squarish,
  and robust monoline sans.\r\n\u2013 Its \"g\" has this basic structure (this is
  my quick sketch after a bad scribble):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pseudo-g_5369.gif]\r\n-
  The font is named \"Pseudo\", or something that sounds similar.\r\n\u2013 The designer's
  name is Michael Hernon (again, or similar, I may well have misheard).\r\n\r\nI'm
  suspecting this might be unreleased, and/or student work."

  body: Well, that's a darn clever typeface. Thanks for pointing to it, anyway. I'm
    pretty envious of you people living in Central Europa, where typographical events
    like the one you attended happen. Up here in polar bear land, nothing but nothing
    is going on typographically.

  body: Well, not really. I work as a designer and editor for a middle-sized national
    newspaper (circulation 16.000 and falling), we've had several horrid downsizing
    processes the last five years, and we're seriously broke, so I guess last year's
    SNDS Crash in Copenhagen was the last design-related conference I'll ever attend,
    unless I pay for it myself. 645 Euros is quite a lot these days. I spent ten days
    in Berlin last summer, however, and fell absolutely in love with Europe's true
    capital. And all the old, new, beautiful, weird and smart typography everywhere!
    Die U-Bahn! Olympia Stadion! Das Bauhaus Archiv! I'm going back this July, actually.
    Any suggestions on type-related must-sees? Where in Scandinavia have you been?

    Javal. Somebody has really been thinking about what serifs [need to] do, as opposed
    to merely where they happen to come from.* It's also interesting that he has not
    opted to implement thorns - probably because the whole is extremely soft, and
    I think it works. My only worry is that this will be relegated mostly to display
    use, since it looks so stylish large. Oh, and what did I tell you about the imminent
    revival of that \"g\" form?  :-)\r\n\r\n* I have to say this is something that
    couldn't have happened at KABK.\r\n\r\nBTW, it's fitting that Unger would bring
    this up - it's quite reminiscent of his own work in the 70s, namely Praxis/Demos.
    Fortunately however this looks totally 21st century.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "There are a few things I might be able to comment on...\r\n\r\nFirstly, thanks
    @altaira for bring my attention to this node  =)\r\n\r\nActually, the early drawings
    *were* for a sans with the 'pseudo' serif structures happening on the a n p &.
    But this caused frequency and line length problems where the characters without
    the outcropping serif fixtures did not mix well with the straight letters when
    set in running text.\r\n\r\nI still have not got the g right yet - there have
    been many versions - I guess you got to keep going till one fits right and doesn't
    grab too much attention from the rest of the characters especially when set together
    like >suggest<. Think Matrix!\r\n\r\nAs far as release - it will be - but I am
    thinking it should be released in a way (package) so a designer has all the typographic
    tools that they need (at least in one weight) to accomplish technical work - so
    that means a text weight and a footnote variant. There will be a communiqu\xE9
    \ at  [[http://www.fontgroup.com|FontGroup]] when imminent. I guess Debut: Jan
    2010.\r\n\r\nI will have to come back later to reply to @hrant as he has revealed
    some interesting insights \u2013 I will have to proceed carefully... \r\n\r\n_________________________________\r\nMichael

    comments, I'd also love to hear how much direct inspiration from Javal (or other
    sources) is in Pseudo, and how much of your process was experimentation & finding
    out what works, without direct external \"models\". \r\nI'm asking because it
    looks very fresh I think (on top of being functional).\r\n\r\nOh, and would you
    mind announcing the release here on Typophile as well? :-)"

  body: "OK Some thing weird is happening when I come to the fitting of the Small
    caps. Due to the nature of curves needing less space in the side bearing zones
    and the fact that the serifs require a negative compensation - the fitting has
    ended up equal. This would have been pretty cool if you were making metal type,
    so I wonder if there is an extra benifit to serifs - that being that you could
    potentially control the side bearings of the type!!!!\r\n\r\nback soon...\r\n\r\n/m\r\n_________________________________\r\nMichael

  body: "@altaira has got it right - Pseudo is a sans (that has serifs)\r\nIt had
    to have serifs because of the odd outcrops seen in the n g p etc. When set the
    type was proving too difficult to control along the base line so started in investigating
    serifs to hold the line. The soft nature of the type means I can move everything
    around like using putty. There is quite allot of difference between each instance
    of the serif depending on the angle of attack and the thickness of the stem etc.
    The aim is to maintain density no matter where on the letter you are. I guess
    there are two states Serif density and letter density. By keeping these even a
    the typeface develops its frequency.\r\n\r\nThe pseudo project was initiated  on
    the MA course at Reading in 2008 and I am continuing to develop it after some
    time off the project. @hrant - Gerard Unger's work has to be influential as he
    has managed to get really close to the archtypal shape of letters. MOL and Praxis
    are massive favorites. But his is not the only influence in this and my other
    projects. Melior and Jenson are contributors in offering direction. Melior - Zapf's
    square circle concept was in line with my thinking and the text weight of Pseudo
    matches the set text density of Jenson. (I was using it as a comparitive reference
    in the early stages of the project untill one day I did and overlay (set solid)
    and it pretty much fitted exactly!\r\n\r\nThis last week I have added a set of
    Small caps and totally refreshed and simplified all of the Caps. Have I mentioned
    I am rocking 25 OpenType features?\r\n\r\nback to it....\r\n\r\n\r\n/u1\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________\r\nMichael
