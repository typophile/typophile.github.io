  for several months, and hope to travel around mainland europe during this time --
  with a bit of an initial adventure in the Czech Republic and Poland beginning this
  friday. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone here could recommend some [[typographic
  destinations]] on the continent.  I'm generally not much for the tourist bit, but
  i imagine letting typography influence the wandering a bit could be quite qood.\r\n\r\nCurrently
  the only thing i had planned was to go to Belgium and stalk Yves so i could observe
  him in his natural environment, but i'm sure there are better suggestions... (or
  at least, other suggestions?)"

    of August ;-) Some local typographers/type designers and I meet once a month for
    drinks, and that's the next date. During the day you can go to the Klingspor Museum
    (www.klingspor-museum.de). There are two great little type design exhibits there
    new, one on [[Rudolf Koch]].\r\n\r\nThere is also the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz,
    which I like quite a lot.\r\n\r\nAt the end of September, the ATypI's annual conference
    will take place on the other side of the Iberian pennisula in Lisbon."

    supposed to be an important collection of typographic works and manuscripts at

    Copyright. They have a great selection of graphic design books & -depending on
    the moment- also some nice books on typography. The Fnac-stores sometimes also
    have great books on their shelves.\r\nThe adresses for the Copyright bookstores

    (until 26-08-2006) in a local comic book store (Mekanik, St. Jacobsmarkt 73) here
    in Antwerp. It only features a few works, but is definitely worth seeing if you
    happen to be in the neighbourhood. The 2 works of Eduardo Recife alone make it
    worth the while!\r\nAnd if you're also into comics or graphic design, it's a fun
    store to visit anyway.\r\n\r\nGood food tips are also available on request ;-)"
