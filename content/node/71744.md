body: "I have recently graduated from a design program (Concordia University, Montreal)
  and I am looking for masters abroad that would combine both type design and typography
  (preferably a one-year program). \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone has information
  about the quality of the masters in Advanced Typography taught at the EINA school
  in Barcelona. Apart from their official website, I have trouble finding extra information
  and comments about this program.\r\n\r\nI am also considering KABK's \"Type and
  Media\". However, from the information I have been able to gather, it seems like
  it much more focused on type design, and much less on typography, am I correct?
  \r\n\r\nFinally, any thoughts about the Centro de Estudios Gestalt (Veracruz, Mexico)?
  Or other suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\nRuxandra"

    I realize now I had not thanked you for your answer, sorry for that. Very belated
    thank you! :)\r\n\r\nAnd to any (ideally Spanish-speaking) student interested
    in such education, I finally chose EINA school in Barcelona. I am very happy with
    my choice, since I have been able to both design and apply type, and I am now
    working on a short thesis. It was all very condensed though, but I have learned
    a lot! I think this program provides a great basis for any graphic designer.\r\n\r\nCheers"
