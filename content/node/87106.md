  am looking for the font i have attached to this post. I know some of it is custom
  work, since the i's are a bit diffrent, but the base font is cool, and i really
  need it. It looked a bit like the font \"Mustang\", but its thicker and more brushy.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\n/Danni"
