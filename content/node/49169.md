    will keep my eyes peeled for your black platen press, I learned wing shooting

    I was surprised one day I saw a picture of a Lisbon newspaper, 1957 if I am right:
    Lisbon covered in 1/4 of inch snow for that once. Over there it is very stable
    four seasons, being the summer the one I used to like most. Now in Florida, I
    prefer the winter...\r\nI printed the sandstorms theory and gave a copy to my
    wife. She is used to it. I guess she has been in all of them since twenty years
    ago.\r\n\r\nI love \"Right and Left\" (thanks for the link). I love natural motives
    and I have been just stunned by the birds in Florida. One of the good things that
    happened to me lately is that a Owl, yes, just made her nest in front of the house
    across the street. She spent a entire day in my little garden; I guess because
    there is a little fountain out there. The last few weeks I did not see her and
    I was wondering what have happened. Three days ago she come back. Good news.\r\n\r\nI
    guess everything is going to be just fine. Cross your fingers :)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    so many people take it in the wrong way.  I am so appreciative of your understanding
    of Homer's \"Right and Left\", I use it as an allegory for many things in a lecture
    I give on \"seeing\".\r\n\r\nMy Dad did business in Europe including Lisbon, Near
    and Far East and Africa from about 1951 on.  Are you from Portugal?\r\n\r\nI love
    your story of the owl.  I too believe in the signs of animals and plants.  On
    my walk today the usual rabbit tolerated me going by, he/she chewed while I stuck
    to my side of the \"trace\" (see previous post.)  A big old owl lives near where
    the bunny lives, though I did not see it today.  Our hummingbirds are acting normally
    for this time of year, which makes me feel better; as if to say \"we are fine,
    so should you be.\"  And the tree frogs at night are having a grand time.\r\n\r\nFingers
    crossed, knock on wood!  If necessary your platen and the 2 engraving proofing
    presses I bought a while ago (but have not yet arrived) will land together in
    some wonderfully accessible field, like Dorothy in \"Wizard of Oz.\""

    Actually I think it is just one duck, diving from the right down and up again
    to the left. No fish. As if today it will be harder to catch. Just look at his
    face of disappointment. A possible explanation that contradicts the story they
    are being shot by a hunter ... I like the composition; a blueish background contrasted
    with a opposite orange-ish for the light areas. I bet he painted the ducks by
    memory, and the question: Why ducks?\r\n\r\nAh, tell me if you know. Why is that
    that old type cuts of flies were so popular? I do understand that Owls were used
    as cuts, I think as a wish of good luck. Now, flies are odd. I just don't understand.
    I want to design some stuff around it ( a fly ), but first I have to understand
    it.\r\n\r\nYes, I am portuguese; born in Brazil and then back to Portugal in the
    mid 80s, when my dad retired. I did study Fine Arts in Seville and Barcelona.
    All paid while working in printing. Do you know that one could travel around the
    world just working in printing, most specially as a pressman?\r\n\r\nJust so you
    can forget for a minute (Ike went up to a category 4...) here is this brilliant
    painting, where Don Diego looks at eternity while painting it, with a dog in the
    first plane, also the midget maid looking at you, with great and peaceful dignity.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Velazquez-Meninas.jpg\r\n\r\nYou

    in the US).\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nPS.: We just saw \"Wizard of Oz\" few weeks
    ago, in the Broadway Palm Dinner Theater, in Fort Myers. Awesome! One can dine

  body: "Dear Andr\xE9,\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding from what I originally read
    about the Homer painting that it was the last painting of his life.  So, the mystery
    is: is the allegory about the final stages of life, or a fruitfull part of it?
    \ In the original you can see a flash of red symbolizing the flash of shot.  Ducks,
    well, maybe so prosaic an answer as that they were so prevelant on the north east
    shore where Homer lived, and water fowling was common.\r\n\r\nNow the fly...funny
    you should ask.  Sometime before Gustav I had one of my \"Nancy\" visions, have
    you ever seen the old sci-fi movie, \"The Fly\"?\r\n\r\nOriginal movie with Vincent
    Price, 1958:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051622/\r\n\r\n1986 re-make with
    Jeff Goldblum:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/\r\n\r\nFor some unknown
    reason the story, and film, came to mind while waiting for that first hurricane
    to hit the Gulf Coast.  When we returned I heard a piece on NPR that it has been
    made into an opera:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theflytheopera.com/\r\n\r\nand that the
    context of the story was modeled around the zeitgeist of today.\r\n\r\nBees were
    popular symbols, but flies?  My husband has a friend who married a woman from
    China.  Joanne is highly educated and very intelligent but one day, the subject
    of \"meat worms\" came up and \"Newt\", my husband's friend, could not argue her
    out of the notion that meat comes with worms and if left out, the worms come out
    from the meat.  Although we know, or think we know, that maggots are insect eggs,
    I believe the larvae from flies.\r\n\r\nAccording to David Fontana, PhD, (The
    Secret Language of Symbols, 2008, \"...flies were considered to be driven by demonic
    forces: Beelzebub, a name now synonymous with Satan, was originally a Syrian personification
    of the destructive power of swarming insects.\"\r\n\r\nJ.C. Cooper writes (An
    Illustrated Encyclopedia of Traditional Symbols, 1978,) \"Usually asociated with
    evil gods and corruption.  Can represent supernatural power, modstly evil...Depicted
    in Christian art with the goldfinch as the Saviour and the fly as disease.\"  (I
    taught \"Graphic Abstractions\" at Louisiana State University for a semester so
    bought all of these books about symbols.)"

    opposing this is called \"spontaneous generation.\" Francesco Redi proved the
    origin of the maggots and disproved spontaneous generation in 1668, though it
    took Pasteur in 1859 to put the final nail in the coffin of the idea.\r\n\r\nRedi's
    experiment is quite celebrated in the history of science, as one of the first
    scientific experiments ever to use \"controlled\" vs \"experimental\" conditions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    I wrote, \"we know...that maggots are insect eggs.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I referred to
    \"think we know [that maggots are insect eggs]\" it is because western science
    and other forms of knowledge and being do not always coincide.  Newt's wife was
    SURE that meat comes with worms.  Her personal realm of scientific reason, learned
    in the western school of medicine, did not prepare her for any other knowledge
    than the (her) fact that, \"meat comes with worms.\"  Her husband, also a highly
    trained kidney dialysis nurse who now practices at Stanford Medical Center, was
    unable to present any science that would turn her from this belief.  Which is
    why I included the caveat \"think we know\".\r\n\r\nI guess it just depends upon
    which butcher you believe."
