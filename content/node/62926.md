body: "Hello everyone. I am a digital illustrator who recently branched out into freelance
  design work. I am not too advanced in using text in illustrator. I am recreating
  a logo for a motorcycle company that has a similar look to Harley Davidson's logo.
  My problem is I can't get the text to arch in the same way the text that says 'Motor'
  and 'Cycles' in the Harley logo. I know the Harley logo might be custom but how
  do I get text to arch so smoothly along that kind of angle? Any help would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nAndrew"

  body: I think it's time to convert the text to outlines and start editing those
    nodes... Your going to have to do this one by hand.
