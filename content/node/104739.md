  The brochure cover/poster is based on a photography (rather classical atmosphere),
  and I'm looking for a font to set the title of the season. I might be using a shape
  in the back to support it (maybe a round shape). Do you have any ideas of modern
  sans serif fonts I could use? Commercial fonts sugegstions are welcome, I have a
  budget for that. I'm looking for something modern, new, distinctive, appealing.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your suggestions! \r\nHed"
