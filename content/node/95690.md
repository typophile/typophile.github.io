  for a print magazine for Patent Attorneys. It will be text heavy with mainly photographic
  head shots and illustration making up the pages.\r\nI like both Farnham and Miller
  but am struggling to decide which is more suitable and will also have more longevity?\r\nThoughts?"

    Dispatch a bit trendy if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after?\r\nBeing square is
    apt to become square."
