  body: "Since the additions necessary to make it support Polish are relatively modest
    (although the ogonek <em>is</em> tricky to pull off nicely) you might consider
    commissioning a customization of Oleo. Of course that's assuming you don't find
    something close enough in style that does support Polish (unless you happen to
    want something nobody else has - a big bonus in terms of branding). If you do
    want to look into such customization there are many people on Typophile (including
    yours truly*) who could do a nice job of it.\r\n\r\n* hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nAs
    for a good text companion, you might consider Adelle Serif.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
