  body: "It sure seems to be a font all right, but the odds are high that it was (or
    might has well have been) a one off creation. Our FAQ talks about how easily and
    cheaply hand-printed fonts can be made. It doesn't look familiar to me, which
    isn't surprising considering how common these fonts are. <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html\">Part
    11 of my Script Font ID Guide</a> is where I would have shown this if I collected
    it, but there are too many of this kind for me to have more than a sampling. I
    don't think it's one of the ClickArt 300 Handwritten fonts collection, which I
    do have shown.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
