    kicks out a match...."

  body: "VHS tape boxes. I used to have a huge number of these, including this brand.
    Looks like a photo compressed font. There are normal width substitutes that might
    pass for _HQ_, such as Century Oldstyle http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/century-os-mt/
    but I didn't spot anything that world work perfectly as a digital substitute for
    the compressed text _HQ HIGH QUALITY TAPE_. The closest I was able to find out
    of the box is Georg Trump's Mauritius Medium Condensed as digitized by Canada
    Type \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MauritiusMediumCondensedInUse_3834.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/mauritius/\r\nAn alternative, Monotype
    Clarendon\xAE Condensed \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MonotypeClarendonCondensedInUse_5727.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/monotype-clarendon/condensed\r\nDon"

  body: "edited:\r\nYou can get a lot closer by taking a bold weight of a font with
    similar letterforms and compressing the width to perhaps 85%\r\nThis one is News
    706 Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/News706BoldInUseWidth85pct_4479.jpg]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-706/\r\nIf you want to get a pretty
    good match you could edit the tail on Q and anything else that you think is out
    of place.\r\nA runner up is Harriet Text Bold \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HarrietTextBoldInUseWidth85pct_4342.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/okay-type/harriet/
    Same comments on editing.\r\nSome fonts have a weight heavier than bold, which
    might give a better match for weight when the width is compressed to perhaps 85%\r\nThis
    one is Ingeborg Heavy.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IngeborgHeavyInUseWidth85pct_3698.jpg]\r\n

  body: Wow, thanks for all the info, Don! I particularly like News 706 Bold and Ingeborg
    Heavy at 85%. I'll try experimenting with those and the others and, perhaps, drawing
    it from scratch as an alternative.
