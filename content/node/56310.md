  body: "OK. The Tekton headline really deviates from the point. FWIW, I did have
    a major crush on Tekton back in the day.\r\n\r\nIs Apple really looking for a
    new CEO? I sweated through the Sculley years and don't want to go back there.
    I'm thinking it's about time in the business/tech cycle for a new upstart company
    and product to wow us. "

    technology in the last, what, 4 decades? Why were there no major challenges from
    Europe or Asia for that matter, yet? Or am I just missing something as usual?'

  body: "@paragraph: First, Taiwan has been challenging us for at least a decade.
    Most of the computers you buy (including Apple) are just rebranded Taiwanese systems
    packed into a case designed by an American or European. And non-US nations were
    leading the design of wireless phone tech of all kinds right up to the release
    of the iPhone. because our government still fund IT more than anybody else. On
    a large-scale level, it\u2019s because things like high-end semiconductor and
    networking hardware design are a hard place to play catch-up, and our companies
    probably end up hiring anyone smart enough to do anything but play catch-up."

    job. Cook is ready to assume the reins full-time should the need arise. \r\n\r\nSteve
    Jobs is still CEO, however, is still involved in major decisions, and is expected
    to return in June."

    some time to give credit where credit is due would have at least one mention of
    Jonathan Ive.\r\n\r\nAlso, the pitch seems to ignore that Apple's success is that
    its very much a hardware company. They invent hardware (iMac, iPod, iPhone, ???). "

    but not Apple. Apple products are very much engineered by Apple, rather than existing
    systems in new boxes. Yes, it's all made overseas, of course.\r\n\r\nAnd lets
    not forget Japan, either."

    a PR quote than an announcement of an upcoming font. I was stating a fact. It's
    actually common knowledge for those who follow Apple's activities. There is no
    evidence to suggest whatsoever that Apple is looking for a new CEO at this time,
    much less someone from outside the company."
