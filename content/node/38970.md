  with me. What is the best program that I could buy that would convert the fonts?

  body: The fonts on your PC will almost certainly work on the Mac too, no conversion
    necessary, especially if they're in TrueType or OpenType format. If that's not
    the case, I remember using <a href="http://www.asy.com/scrcf.htm">CrossFont</a>
    back in the day, but there may be something better out there now.

    is the finest converter. But if you want to keep legal, you should check the EULAs
    for your fonts. Most foundries don't allow conversions. You can also ask the source
    retailer to convert the fonts for you.

    in one of the Adobe font directories.

  body: "There was once a freeware utility called TT Converter that would convert
    Windows .TTF files into MacOS 9 TrueType suitcases (sometimes taking system-crashing
    corruption with them). Under MacOS X that's no longer necessary. TTF files <em>are
    supposed to</em> work natively. A few of them just won't, but they may have been
    technically flawed to begin with.\r\n\r\nFor the PostScript fonts, yeah, you will
    have to go with one of the above suggestions, or maybe open the fonts in [[http://fontforge.sf.net/|FontForge]]
    and save them out to a Mac usable format."
