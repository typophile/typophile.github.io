body: Anyone been to St Pancras International Station yet? Design Week magazine says
  the signage typeface is a Dalton Maag offering called <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/St_Pancras_signage.JPG">Barlow</a>
  (named after the designer of the magnificent trainshed there). Can't find anything
  about it on their website but I would love to see the whole family close-up...?

  body: "I'm guessing the Impact reference is to the <a href=\"http://www.stpancras.com/\">brand
    identity</a> only.\r\n\r\nYes, it's a lot like Frutiger but up close and personal,
    it's nothing like it. I know that Dalton Maag designed a typeface for <a href=\"http://www.southernrailway.com/\">Southern
    Railways</a> but I think this is different again."

    is it? Just kidding, although it may well be a cut of Times."

  body: "It looks like Stroudley.\r\nhttp://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/stroudley\r\nAnd
    very nice it is too. There is a definite lack of typefaces for signage. I'm travelling
    from St Pancras next week, and this heightens my anticipation a little. "

  body: "The Southern logo, the Dalton Maag website says, is supported by Stroudley.
    I think the St Pancras signage is different again (maybe only slightly). Any chance
    of a pdf, Bruno?\r\n\r\nAlex, check the <a href=\"http://www.dentwatches.com/history.html#21st\">clock</a>
    out in trainshed, its a monster. Like Big Ben and now bearing the name of the
    company on the massive face too. Can't find a picture of it, even on their website."

    slightly more condensed than Stroudley but quite the same in structure. And no,
