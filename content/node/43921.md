  on Friday</a> While trying to avoid a traffic jam.\r\n\r\n(any idea why the .1 is
  smaller than the 4? is or was there some convention about making numbers after the
  decimal smaller?\r\n\r\n\r\nthey used templates to copy and lay out the letters
  on signs like this that were made one or two at a time before computer driven plotters
  came along. My theory is that the sign painter could find or didn't bother to look
  for the correct size of 1. maybe off the wall... but... oh, who cares :-) \r\n\r\n"

    I wonder if in your case, it was maybe supposed to be a clever use of visual hierarchy
    or something? Especially since you said they always seem to do it that way. Hm."

    yes. As road signs go, it makes sense that from a distance or with limited visibility
    (fog, rain, etc.) the driver can quickly distinguish between, say, 4.5 km and
    45 km."
