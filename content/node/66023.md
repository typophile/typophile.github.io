body: "I am a traditional typographer having difficulty understanding HTML tools,
  some are easy, such as <em>emphasis</em>; though why \"ital\" wasn't used rather
  than \"em\" is a mystery; shouldn't \"em\" have been reserved for an em-space?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Type-example_3997.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  above example is easy to set in typographic programs such as QuarkXPress or InDesign,
  and the coding made sense on Quadex and other type systems, back in the day. Note
  that there are hanging numerals in bold, the text is set 9/11, with alignment for
  breaking lines, and 2 pts additional space between paragraph returns. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Superior_4827.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  same goes for the superior shown, again, easy in Quark or InDesign, nearly impossible
  (at least to me) in HTML.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue in Quark is easy for a typographer
  to understand:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/QuarkDialogue_5061.png]\r\n\r\nI've
  been wading through page after page of code for two days now, and am more befuddled
  than when I began. Can someone please recommend a resource for learning Dreamweaver,
  HTML, and CSS that is geared to typographers? The web people I've been able to speak
  to seldom understand even the word \"leading\". Can someone give me some hope?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Originally, HTML, and SGML on which it was based, was highly unfriendly to
    typographers. Initially you didn't have access to leading, paragraph indents,
    or paragraph spacing. We still are hampered with lack of hyphenation, making justified
    text ugly, although possible. It was all originally built by a committee of programmers,
    with little or no typographic input.\r\n\r\nWhen CSS came out, it did get some
    input from typographers, and you can now do many more things. (Although I am still
    baffled how you can use em as a dimension without it being based on some other
    element).\r\n\r\nSlowly the ugly is being squeezed out of HTML, but it is a slow
    process.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the hardest step for a print designer is to learn
    that on the Web, you never know what size of 'paper' you are designing for. Get
    past that, and you are more than half way towards being a web designer.\r\n\r\nOh
    yeah, you did ask a question ... I use http://www.w3schools.com as an excellent
    learning resource on HTML and CSS."

  body: "@ Cameron\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the difference between the logical structure
    and the style is important, because many people with handicaps are also using
    computers. Blind people are using screenreaders. If the markup is misused for
    the style, the access to the content is harder for them. Cascading Style Sheets
    are not limited to the visual style by the way. But how should a screenreader
    interpret the expression \"italic\"? The expression indicates a visual style,
    while \"emphasis\" indicates \"importance\". Additionally it would be absurd to
    style the italic element upright bold with the help of CSS, while there are cases
    in which it makes sense to style the em element upright bold.\r\n\r\nFor the same
    reason you should make use of attributes like \"title\" or elements like \"acronym\".
    In case of the acronym-element the handicap is the limited knowledge of the user.
    The biggest handicap is stupidity. This does not mean, that you always should
    design for the most stupid user, but in case of websites, that are intended to
    be used by a wide range of users, that don\u2019t belong to a group with special
    interests, the Amazon website or a government website for example, you should
    keep in mind, that many people are more stupid than you or that many people are
    less competent than you.\r\n\r\nThere are cases, in which blinds are not in your
    target group. I think, this website is one example \u2013 although even on this
    website you probably find discussions about braille."

    guidelines but have become more pragmatic over the years. Partly because I'm not
    a pundit and have to adhere to demands of others and partly because the more you
    learn about web accessibility, the more gray area you find within it. It's getting
    better (really looking forward to ARIA standards). \r\n\r\nIn the end, it all
    depends. Apply and/or ignore the rules of thumb based on the context of the site
    you are building. \r\n\r\nricadus is sort-of correct. If the numeral is an image,
    and a user changes their font size, it may not scale in relation to the type.
    You could get around that by sizing the image in ems. The other issue if a person
    is using page-zoom (via the OS or the browser itself) the image will scale, but
    quickly become much more pixelated than the text. That may be an issue. But that's
    but one way to skin the cat. \r\n\r\nYou can do a lot with HTML + CSS but there
    are limitations when comparing it to traditional typesetting. It's up to you to
    decide when over-rides are warranted and when they are not. Both from an end-user
    usability/accessibility standpoint as well as production-side sanity. \r\n"

    separate the styles of the numerals and the style of the list contents itself.\r\n\r\nAlas,
    the period is part of the browser's rendering of ordered lists so there'd be no
