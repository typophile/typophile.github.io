body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nThis is a deceptively simple font to identify -- for me at
  least.  I've searched the web extensively, gone to www.whatthefont.com, and have
  obtained no concrete results.  This font looks so familiar...but subtly different.\r\n\r\nThe
  font I'm talking about is the font (or, what I'm assuming is a font) used in the
  logo for the movie \"Titanic\" : not Trajan, but the Impact-esque font used in the
  logo (with the rivets in the text).  First glances make this seem like Impact, but
  the font doesn't quite match up to the logo.  (For instance, the \"T\" is different...it
  has slight points on each end of the horizontal line.)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions as
  to what this font might be would be greatly appreciated.  Examples are included
  below.  (Some are taken from promotional material for the film; others are taken
  from the film's movie trailers.  These fonts seem to be roughly the same.)\r\n\r\n"

  body: I could be wrong here, but a highly-condensed Helvetica (I'm mostly going
    by the R)?

  body: "The closest \"Helvetica\" I could find was \"Helvetica Inserat,\" which is
    an almost exact duplicate of \"Impact.\"  :(  The thing to notice is that there
    is a slight sharpness on the bottom and top edges of the letters, most noticeably
    in the bottom example (one with the rivets).  Notice how the T and I have a sort
    of spread-out at the bottom ... it's subtle, but noticeable.  Helvetica Inserat
    (and Impact) don't have this.  Also, for some reason, I think that the bar in
    the \"A\" character is a bit too high in Helvetica Inserat (and Impact)...I'm
    not sure why I say this, but it doesn't look right to me.  One of the closest
    fonts I've found thusfar is Agency FB Black Compressed; however, the C doesn't
    match up on this, and it's still very not close.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?"

  body: i would bet it's custom. i've done work for films here and there; seems to
    be more of an awareness of the value of a custom typeface in that industry than
    in most.

  body: "Boo...was hoping this one wouldn't be custom.  I've asked quite a few questions
    about film fonts on another forum (which, sadly, is now defunct) and the answer
    was usually a customized typeface or else one made from scratch.\r\n\r\nThe S
    makes me think Univers or something like that ... although it's way too compressed.\r\n\r\nWho
    knows. :-\\\r\n\r\nThanks for the help, and keep your eyes open if anything pops
    up!"

    is custom.  :(  Oh well...maybe one day a font will appear that's really close!!

  body: "It might be a mix of Helvetica and AgencyFB Black Compressed ... Coliseum
    has its similarities too...\r\n\r\nThe thing I see is that the R is almost certainly
    a Helvetica rip-off of some sort, and AgencyFB would work if certain parts were
    extended (i.e. if the \"C\" was dropped down a bit more and the \"M\" was as well).\r\n\r\nHere
    are some more pictures, in case anyone needs them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/d_4659.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/c1_3429.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/c2_4820.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
