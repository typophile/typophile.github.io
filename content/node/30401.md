  I've seen it recently). I attempted to draw the character as best as possible. Does
  anyone know what typeface or typefaces have a similar glyph? Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Curl

  body: I found one possibility, Jeremy Tankard's <a href=http://www.typography.net/type/shires.htm>Shire
    Shropshire</a>, but I feel like the font I seek is lighter and straighter, like
    the sample I drew.

  body: Thanks, Mike and Paolo. Unfortunately, none of those seems exactly what I'm
    looking for (Sansa is closest). I feel like I've seen a letter just about as unadorned
    as the one I drew. Thinking more, the character might have been an alternate E.
    Unless I made up this character, in which case, yay! But I doubt it.

  body: Nope, never seen FS Sophie before. I'm thinking that I'm essentially remembering
    the E's from Tankard's Shropshire and Cheshire, as I've been looking at those
    fonts lately. Thanks for all the help.
