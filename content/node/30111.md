  body: Verdana is included with the MS Internet Explorer installer, and is therefore
    ubiquitous. Also it is designed to be very legible on screen at very small sizes.
    I don't know how one would measure its popularity, though. Certainly it is one
    OF the most popular web fonts, but I have doubts that it is THE most popular.

    Matthew made the black of the characters wider in many cases to increase the readability
    and to fix the compressed nature of Tahoma that was originally made as a UI font."

    use of a font using the name Tahoma. It actually was the protype font 'Ohana'
    renamed. \r\n\r\nI supplied a bitmap font in a .fon form for 18, 22 pt VGA that
    would be used during the Windows 95 installation process. The reason a bitmap
    was necessary was during system installation there isn't a rasterizer present
    so static bitmaps were used for text and graphics.\r\n\r\nOutlines were made and
    a .ttf created Sept 02 1994 to a full Win/ANSI character set. This font was fully
    hinted in TrueType. \r\n\r\nThe original idea that Matthew had was to do something
    like Geneva on the Mac but the final result was a bit too close and it got scrapped.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ohana_4132.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    also made some bitmap only TrueType fonts of the original Tahoma bitmaps which
    had 3 sizes of bitmaps (11,12 and 14 ppem) and only circles for outlines. These
    were the ones used in testing and later when Tom Rickner was hinting he had to
    match the bitmaps I put in. The  font at that time was called Tahoma Condensed.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tahomacd_5463.jpg]"
