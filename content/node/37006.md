body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI was recently offered a letterpress alphabet set and although I
  dont have a letterpress I couldn't resist. However, I'm a bit stuck on how to use
  them now. I've had a play using normal calligraphy ink but the results aren't exactly
  great as the ink is blotchy.\r\n\r\nCould anyone give me any tips on how to use
  the letters without a press or perhaps point me in the directions of a website which
  could help me out?\r\n\r\nThanks very much!\r\n\r\nJono\r\n\r\n(here's a pic of
  my experimentations so far!)\r\nhttp://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p141/jonomaverick/jonoletterpress.jpg"

  body: "You can use Block Printing Ink, not Calligraphy ink. They make waterbased
    Block Printing ink that is a bit easier to handle if you don't have a good studio
    in which to use oil based inks (clean up is messy), but oil based inks are the
    most beautiful and don't dry up as fast. I use speedball water based inks at home
    sometimes, but real letterpressmen use inks specified for letterpress or sometimes
    lithography inks I think.\r\n\r\nGet a soft rubber brayer to ink them up as well.
    Depending on how big those blocks are though, you might get a blotchy feel anyway,
    letterpress tends to give you that. When there is a large printing area, it is
    tough to get even coverage with letterpress, even when you have a press. If you
    use block ink or lithography ink (oil based), you will almost certainly get a
    thicker layer of ink than if you use calligraphy inks. \r\n\r\nI also used to
    use a rolling pin to pull monoprints from plexyglass and linoleum cuts when I
    was in college. It isn't exactly professional, but it can help get a job done.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n\r\nsteve\r\n\r\n \r\n"

  body: "There is a way to print from a font without a press. I used to use a felt
    covered block and a soft mallet.\r\nI would ink the form with a soft rubber brayer
    using printers' ink. Lay the paper on top of the inked form and them gently place
    the block over the paper and tape the block with the mallet.\r\nMake sure that
    the type form is held together with string wrapped several times around the form.
    This is called block proofing."
