  body: Doesn't look anything like a Goudy to me. Serifs are too sharp. Aren't goudy's
    rounded?

  body: "Norbert, I think you basically have it. I think it is an extra dark version
    of Bembo that was issued by FontBank called <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/bianca.htm\">'Bianca'</a>.(They
    also had a similar one with a lower x-height called 'Benson'.)\r\n\r\n<em>(Whenever
    there seems to be a very heavy weight of a text font, that's one of the first
    collections I look at.)</em>\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    (and looks like you get your two bucks worth)."
