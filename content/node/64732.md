  similar to the initials in the background of this logo. I have never worked in this
  style of typography and was wondering:\r\n\r\nIs this an actual typeface?\r\nIs
  it constructed from a ornamental font?\r\nOr is it totally hand rendered?\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone knows of any ornament fonts similar to this style i would greatly appreciate
  it.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo1_1_5188.jpg]"
