body: "Time ago I posted the [[http://typophile.com/node/47627|newborn font <strong>Patagonica</strong>]]
  for critizising.\r\nNow I go again, after some basis changes on the original design,
  with a new set of characters slightly different at the point I solved to rename
  it Patagonica 2.0 for such reasons.\r\n[[http://marcelosoler.com/mcs/patagonia2.php
  | Here]] you can find [[http://marcelosoler.com/mcs/patagonia2.php|a sample PDF]]
  for Patagonica text (the font is, as supposed, embedded in the file).\r\nIt is inteded
  to be a body text and captions family (I'm working on bold/italic/light weights
  and alternate styles), highly readable and Spanish readers oriented \u2014it includes
  special treatment for Spaniard kerning and special chars like \xF1, \xE1, \xE9,
  \xED, \xF3, \xFA...\u2014, thought it must have a good behavior in other languages.\r\nHere
  it goes.\r\nThank you for your contribution.\r\n\r\nMarcelo Soler\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture

  body: "Thank you, Pieter. I did not know (until your reference) Greta type. May
    be both faces \u2014Greta and Patagonica\u2014 use similar geometrical geometrical
    basis and linear alike serif. Here I post two screen captures for comparison.\r\n\r\nThis
    is <strong>Greta</strong>, as showed at the link you post:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PGreta_3984.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    is <strong>Patagonica</strong>, for the same text (I am sorry for the lack of
    ligatures because of the software I used to render it):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PPata_6577.png]\r\n\r\nI
    guess differences are clear at a glance, but, nevertheless, it is true that \u201Ci\u201D,
    \u201Co\u201D or \u201Cy\u201D have some similarities, though the rest of characters
    have not.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I will work hard in \u2018unsticking\u2019 my font
    from that unexpected resemblance. It would be certainly a shame.\r\n\r\nMarcelo

  body: I don't want to discourage you, Marcelo, but I think Patagonica is far too
    similar to Greta in its current state.
