body: "Hello! I have a somewhat technical font question and I was told this website
  would be a good place to ask. I also posted this question in the Hebrew typeface
  board, but noticed that the board's latest post was two weeks ago, so I decided
  to post here too.\r\n\r\nI've just begun to work with my university's student run
  TV station. I got an email from the graphics team leader with a supposedly all-encompassing
  list of the fonts available on the titling machine ( this list provided below).
  I noticed quickly that most of these are foreign fonts- arabic, thai, han, hebrew,
  etc. Only a few were roman character fonts. I responded telling her that most of
  those fonts aren't actually fit for our use, and was surprised at the discussion
  over which fonts people like more, Aharoni or David.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that
  typing English sentences under one of these fonts will result in the use of a generic
  font, since trying that out in many of these got me thin, non-smoothed, ugly fonts.
  I was confused though, by the fact that they all did look slightly different, and
  that the Hebrew fonts, in word, didn't work (trying to format normal text as Arabic
  just reverted back to the default Word font).\r\n\r\nCould someone explain exactly
  whether or not these fonts contain English character sets, and whether or not they're
  actually improper to use for English writing? I tried to do some research of my
  own but didn't find anything besides endless websites advertising foreign font downloads
  without explanation of their inner-workings.\r\n\r\nThis is the list:\r\nCordia
  New, Cordia UPC, DilleniaUPC, Dotum, Dotum Che, EucrosiaUPC, FressiaUPC, Gulim,
  Gulim Che, Gungsuh, GungsuhChe, IrisUPC, JasmineUPC, KodchiangUPC, LilyUPC, MS Gothic,
  MS Mincho, MS PGothic, MS PMincho, MS UI Gothic, Microsoft Sans Serif, MingLiU,
  NSimSun, P Ming Liu, SimHei, SimSun, Simplified arabic, Simplified Arabic Fixed,
  Tahoma, Traditional Arabic, Verdana"

  body: "I'm pretty sure that all these fonts contain at least an ASCII Latin set
    and possibly a Win ANSI (CP 1252) set. It is Microsoft policy to include support
    for at least one full 8-bit Windows codepage in every font, regardless of the
    targeted script(s) for the font, and all of those codepages have an ASCII 7-bit
    set as their core. So, for example, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1255\">Windows
    Hebrew codepage (CP 1255)<a> has Latin characters and symbols in the lower half,
    and Hebrew characters in the upper half.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a functional requirement
    for most modern software, i.e. it is possible to make a font that contains only
    particular Unicode characters, not a full 8-bit codepage, which will work correctly
    in most places. But for backwards compatibility reasons it is still recommended
    to support at least one 8-bit codepage, and Microsoft do so even in fonts targeting
    scripts that never had their own Windows codepages defined. Such fonts usually
    contain the Win ANSI (CP 1252) set.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, as you have noted, the
    Latin inclusion in the fonts is 'generic' or, rather, will tend to be one of the
    core Windows fonts such as Times New Roman or Arial. Sometimes the Latin is scaled
    to better harmonise with the target script.\r\n\r\nI would not use any of the
    fonts you list for setting Latin script text, since the same designs exist in
    fonts that probably support them more fully, e.g. with better kerning or additional
    characters.\r\n\r\nNote that a few of the MS fonts targeting particular scripts
    have custom designed Latin inclusions that harmonise with the target script. Examples
    are 'Arabic Typesetting' and 'Nyala' (Ethiopic). These Latin designs are not accessible
    outside of those fonts, so they are sometimes used to typeset English and other
    Latin script languages. However, their character sets and language coverage is
    more limited than for most Latin script fonts on Windows, since they aim only
    to support one or two 8-bit codepages, and they only exist in one weight and style."

  body: "{Copying my reply from your other post.}\r\n\r\nMany Latin components of
    non-Latin fonts are illegitimate and/or low-quality. Except for \"official\" ones
    (like the ones that come with Windows) which are however usually very generic,
    hence do not match the non-Latin in style (and are rarely highly usable just for
    Latin anyway).\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you need some real (and non-OS) fonts. But
    do you do a fair amount of non-Latin as well?\r\n\r\nBTW make sure laymen don't
    get to choose which fonts to use - that's what designers are for.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    others, and make an effort to get it added to the station handbook.\r\n\r\nTomorrow
    I'm going to see if I can put the Adobe CS fonts onto the machine, and I'll be
    browsing for decent free to use fonts to add to their collection. I don't think
    there has ever been any need for foreign character use on any of the shows.\r\n\r\nHrant,
    the person who came up with the list is, in fact, the <em>lead</em> designer,
    and I think she's paid too. The station is very much student run, mostly by kids
    with no prior experience, so the level of professionalism varies over time."

  body: "My personal opinion on a good subtitling font tends towards a slightly-condensed
    low-contrast slab serif, similar to Rockwell. Still, I think that Droid Sans or
    PT Sans might work. Both are available freely, by the way.\r\n\r\nHmm... Computer
    Modern Concrete is a slab serif, and you school folk may already be familiar with
    it through Donald Knuth's other works. Plus, if there's a good Metafont hacker
    on hand, (s)he could very likely customise its weight and width for your specific
    needs."
