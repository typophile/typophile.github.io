body: We've been doing some work with Garamond Simoncini, but nobody here seems to
  like the italics (don't ask me why, I'm just an assistant). Can anyone give me any
  suggestions as to fonts that have a similar but better italic? I've looked at Simoncini's
  other fonts, Life and New Aster, but if anyone has some further suggesions, I would
  appreciate it.

    Premier Pro</a>. The italics are based on those of [[Robert Granjon]] and are
    a nice foil for the roman of [[Claude Garamond]]. The bonus from using this family
    will be the optical options available.'
