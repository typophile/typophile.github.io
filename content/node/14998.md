  body: "Now that is one <em>very</em> bitmapped sample.\r\n\r\nThe logo looks something
    like Gill Sans or Lucida Sans (shows how difficult it is to recognise the faces),
    while I'm quite positive the baseline is set in Univers Condensed."

  body: "Much clearer version available on their annual report here:\r\nhttp://www.met.police.uk/annualreport/pdfs/mpa_mps_2004_05.pdf\r\n\r\nI've
    got a feeling that this is a customised sans. I think Wolff Olins may well have
    done the brand...? See this report from 1997:\r\nhttp://www.morrisinquiry.gov.uk/downloads/evidence-inq-103.pdf\r\n\r\nAlso
    on Wally Olins own biog website:\r\nhttp://wallyolins.com/biog.htm#\r\n\r\nI think
    Yves is right: Tagline is a condensed version of Univers (not sure which weight
    without checking) but I have a feeling you want to know the Metropolitan Police
    font.\r\n\r\nThe stresses are oblique (see M and N). Notably, the P's are different
    top and bottom. Bottom P looks Myriad-ish but the rest isn't Myriad. I don't think
    I have ever seen an R with a tail like that."
