  body: "From what I could find, I see the 55th TDC competition was 2009, so that
    makes me think that the fourth may have been in 1958 (assuming one per year).
    This would mean we are looking at metal or photo type.\r\n\r\nI just looked in
    my Solotype Catalog, and found it as \"Athenean Wide\" (p.128)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Through some Googling I found that SSK digitized this in at least 2 weights
    using the name Tobias. I recall SSK as one of the sources with a bad reputation,
    so I don't know if you want to look further, but I did find at least one site
    with TobiasSSK in two weights. It is the same design.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
