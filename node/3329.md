  having a great deal of trouble with... <BR> <BR>Im trying to mock up a signage project

  some korean, chinese, and arabic, dummy text. Nothing fancy, but I would like to
  be able to set in in Quark. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know if there are basic freeware
  fonts that would work on the english keyboard layout, or some other way that wouldnt
  require me installing any new language packs or whatnot. Ive been scouring Luc&#39;s
  pages to no avail. Any help would be much apprecciated. Hope everyone had a pleasant
  weekend. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Jables '
