  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm in the initial process of developing a logo for a friend's business, My PC Handyman. I'm looking for some concepts to work up. It's a little bit of a clunky name, but I think there's potential as well. I have considered using a toolbox theme, a more digital theme, as well as his idea of a figure carrying a computer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My concern is the name and if I add a graphic that it might be distracting to the name. I'm also conerned about the 'PC' part. I don't want it to get lost and hopefully PC is interpretted properly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any thoughts? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Adam - <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think you are moving in the right direction with the addition of the icon.  Shawn's idea is a good one.  When I saw your initial concept my thought was &quot;Why isn't there an icon of a computer monitor in the middle of the logo with 'PC' within it?&quot;  That incorporates the graphic/name into one concise image - rather than looking as if the icon was just slapped up against the name as an afterthought.  Another option might be to make your toolbox graphic look like a computer monitor with the addition of the screen shape on the side of an elongated toolbox. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- J. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::  :: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeff Fisher :: Engineer of Creative Identity <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeff Fisher LogoMotives <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::  :: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Member -  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HOW Magazine Editorial Advisory Board <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Member -  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2005 HOW Design Conference Advisory Board <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Author - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;The Savvy Designer's Guide to Success: Ideas and tactics for a killer career&quot; - to be released by HOW Design Books in late 2004.

		<div class="commentbody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;Sorry about being confusing, it happens on friday sometimes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All i really meant was with the logo that has the mouse - it seems to be placed really close to the my pc handyman. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was also wondering if you had thought about how the combination might work when a vertical orientation was necessary.  Of course a vertical orientation might never be necessary, but if it is its always better to have an option, rather than seeing your client squish it in word or something. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hope that made more sense, by the way is it beer-thirty yet? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->s.&lt;/font&gt;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really like the execution of the mouse idea. The first monitor one looks nice but i don't think it communicates &quot;computer&quot; as well as the mouse does, just because the shape of the monitor isn't as recognizable. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would definately keep fiddling around with the mouse and toolbox icon with different arrangements of text.

		<div class="commentbody">I do agree that the mouse image works very well (and that it may be a bit too close to the name).  With the combined toolbox/monitor image I think having the monitor on the end of the toolbox results in the monitor image being too small.  If you were going to use such an element, I think having the monitor on the larger side of the toolbox would make it work better and would allow it to still &quot;read&quot; as what you intend in smaller sizes. It's great to see the evolution of your concept. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- J.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->:: :: :: :: :: :: ::  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeff Fisher :: Engineer of Creative Identity  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeff Fisher LogoMotives  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->:: :: :: :: :: :: ::  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Member -  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HOW Magazine Editorial Advisory Board  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Member -  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2005 HOW Design Conference Advisory Board  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Author -  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;The Savvy Designer's Guide to Success: Ideas and tactics for a killer career&quot; - to be released by HOW Design Books in late 2004.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all the feedaback. I appreciate the critique and it is helping me push the design along. I will work on the placment and vertical variation as well. You're right, I might need somewhere down the line.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any color ideas/suggestions/opinions at this point? I really only have experimenting with color combos at this point. I'm curious if any really catch anyone's eye to date?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will explore these things when I get back to my working files on Tuesday. I'm just about out of time on this project I think, so I'm hoping to wrap it up by the end of next week. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam</div>

I think he's very happy with it, so that makes me happy as well. BTW, I am now co-owner of the business too! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I did move the mouse and toolbox away from the text a little, made the mouse a two button instead of three and increased the negatve space on the left edge on the front side of the toobox. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am also beginning to think we may be able to use the icon all by itself at some point and in certain situations down the line.
