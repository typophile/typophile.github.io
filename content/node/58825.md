  body: "Ciould you possibly show another sample with some other letters? I am trying
    to use the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]], and the a, e, J and g are the only key letters in your sample
    and I'm not finding it with those. Is that the complete J (no truncation of the
    lower end of the hook?)\r\n\r\nMaybe if you have a more complete sample, you could
    try it too.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
