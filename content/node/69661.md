  training in design, so please forgive me if my questions are a bit amateurish! I
  am simply taking great pleasure in learning about the history of type, and I am
  making an effort to apply principles of good typography to my master's thesis.\r\n\r\nSince
  my thesis is somewhat technical, there are frequent parenthetical or bracketed strings
  of numbers or acronyms. To my untrained eye, the full-sized parentheses seem out
  of proportion amidst oldstyle figures and small cap acronyms. So, my questions:\r\n<!--break-->\r\n1.
  Are oldstyle figures still appropriate for scientific text? Typophiles seem to be
  quite fond of them, but none of the major medical journals appear to use them. \r\n\r\n2.
  Should I consider setting parentheses and brackets in semibold at a smaller point
  size and/or shifting the baseline to bring them in proportion with surrounding text?\r\n\r\n3.
  Arno Pro and Kepler Std are top contenders for use in my thesis. The former might
  be a little too calligraphic for the subject, so I\u2019m leaning towards Kepler.
  However, Arno does have oldstyle & small cap variants for parentheses and brackets
  that I think look much better among oldstyle figures and small cap acronyms. Would
  these be appropriate uses for these alternates? Thoughts? Suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your comments."

    sure. Ideally they would have been appropriate for every kind of text, but since
    they're not, I'd hesitate to introduce them myself. Typography is much about what
    we're used to.\r\n\r\n<cite>Should I consider setting parentheses and brackets

    it look good, which isn't trivial at all, don't do it unless you can set your
    typesetting system to take care of it automatically. It would be hell if you had
    to take care of it every time you changed the content of your text.\r\n\r\n<cite>However,

    exactly what they're for! :-)"

    IS much about what we're use to. The usual comparison of graphic design is to
    architecture, but I'd say set design for the theater is maybe a better analogy.
    Architecture can have an element of removing itself from an audience -- in the
    fine arts, if you don't like something, it can be taken as YOUR problem. Good
    set design always has one eye toward audience. Your thesis is to be read, not
    hung on the wall.\r\n\r\nA second thing to remember is that as a group, old style
    numbers have ascenders - 6 and 8, and decenders 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9, along with
    the x-height numbers 1 and 2. Anything you come up with will have to accommodate
    all numbers. Curiously, lower-case letters also have ascenders, decenders, and
    x-height letters. Do the parens bother you with text? If not, but they do bother
    you with numbers, you may have answered your question about audience. (They don't
    bother me with numbers . . .)\r\n\r\nYou also want to be careful using small caps
    in a scientific setting. Again, do what is customary."

    figures may confuse readers with subscripts, which get common in Chemistry and
    some Sciences. \r\n\r\n(To preempt messages from typophiles pointing out how different
    a subscript looks from an OSF, I know this, and agree. But scientists don't, and
    some will complain. I suspect this is why OSF are not used in most journals. When
    tried, there would be a raft of complaints.) "

  body: "When I put together my PhD thesis (Genetics), I used Arno Pro because it
    has small parentheses and brackets that went well with the oldstyle figures. Acronyms
    were in small caps, too. I liked the \"calligraphic\" feel of Arno, as my thesis
    addressed some longstanding questions in the field, and several of my citations
    were from the 19th century.\r\n\r\nOf those who read it, nobody commented on the
    typography. You could take that to indicate that the readers only focused on the
    subject matter, which is likely since they were mostly my committee members. Or
    it could be interpreted to mean that my typographical choices were invisible,
    or at least not obtrusive or countereffective.\r\n\r\nEliason, that thread was
    helpful. For the next printing I'll put all of my citations in small caps."
