  that would look good used with Futura Extra Bold. I've tried all the cuts of Futura
  I have and a load of other fonts but can't find anything decent. The closest I've
  come to something near to acceptable is the '@' in LT Kabel Black, but that's not
  great. Anybody have any suggestions?\r\n\r\n(PS. I've had a go at designing my own,
  but I'm no type designer and the end results looked crude as hell...)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"
