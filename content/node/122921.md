  like to convert our Frutiger font files to the .fnt file format.  The .fnt file
  format can be used by an engraving machine we've purchased to produce facility signage.\r\n\r\nWe've
  come to an agreement with Monotype for a custom license that allows the conversion.
  \ \r\n\r\nHowever, Monotype no longer has the capability to complete the conversion
  to .fnt.  We need a separate font company to assist in the file conversions and
  any necessary font adjustments.  \r\n\r\nAny suggestions for groups that we might
  approach for this effort?  \r\n\r\nI've reached out to some of the more well-known
  foundries.  So far the responses are not good.  No one is equipped for .fnt creation.\r\n\r\nI
  understand that the .fnt format is archaic, but it's the only format the engraver
  will support.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any insight on this topic!"

  body: '".fnt" is kind of a generic file extension. Do you have more details? Could
    it be the Windows 3.0 "bitmapped" type, as used as a rendering cache to quickly
    display monochrome fonts? (I know -- the latter doesn''t really rhyme with ''engraving'',
    but perhaps the machine''s manufacturor chose this file format because it''s a
    fairly simple one.)'

    is an old retired program and it works only with old 256 characteres font.\r\nSami\r\n\r\n"

  body: '[as Sami told] I made a trip .pfb -> .fnt -> .ttf and it looks OK. Important
    thing - .pfb with no more than 256 letters. The .ttf file with two glyphs with
    messed orientation, the rest looks good.'

    Not antialiased, though."

    then go to \r\n<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;File -&gt; Generate Fonts...</code> \r\nwith
    <code>No Outline Font</code> and <code>Win FNT</code>. Even if I read a .fon extension
    before saving, the file saved is <code>.fnt</code> and looks ok."

  body: .fnt are scalable fonts aka Nimbus-Q (Digital Typeface Corp., Geo Works in
    the DOS times) - like Speedo, Intellifonts, Corel's .wfn, etc.
