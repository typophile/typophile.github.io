  body: "\r\nSorry about the late reply here!\r\nThanks all very much for your help
    and suggestions. \r\n\r\nLex, I think that you are right about perhaps using a
    regular font and then tweaking it all afters - there are several elements of the
    Breastbomb font that I would end up changing, so i figure I am better off just
    working from something else a little more \"tight\".\r\n\r\nBald Condensed, thanks
    so much for the heads up on Eduardo Recife - very helpful and I really enjoyed
    looking at the site. I like both Porcelain and Selfish. Nars is cool too, but
    (annoying) my invites have to be my Mum friendly and I don't think she'd be so
    up for it.\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated!"
