  a sample in a catalogue, a magazine, a book, and other printed materials? in other
  words: do you have to purchase a typeface in order to show a sample of it in a printed

    when you haven\u2019t purchased it? If you mean a photography of the sample (from
    a book or else) by your own, then you are the creator of the photo so it should
    be fine, in my opinion. "

  body: "<cite>Not if it\u2019s for sale.</cite>\r\n\r\nBeing commercial doesn't necessarily
    kill fair use, at least not in the US. There are other factors at work. (Otherwise,
    you'd never read book reviews that actually cite the book under review in a for-profit
    newspaper.) \r\n\r\nHowever, my advise is this: get copyright clearance on everything
    and/or consult a good IP attorney. "

    have bought it already. If you\u2019re displaying an image of a printed source,
    you should be fine as long as you attribute the image and your entire work does
    not consist of nothing but images of type samples."

  body: well, that's ok, but we could regard publishing of a typeface sample as typeface
    promotion. after all, that's what FontBook is about.

  body: "> <em>how does FontShop sell the Font Book with thousands of typeface samples?</em>\r\n\r\nBecause
    they are the distributor of most -- if not all -- of the typefaces in the book,
    obviously. Or even have exclusive rights, in the case of FontFonts (FF). :)\r\n\r\nI
    think it will most definitely also depend on what kind of printed matter. If it
    is an article in a magazine about a typeface, I can't see why anyone would protest
    if you print a PDF specimen with the article. But if you print it on a poster
    and sell the poster, I could see a problem. So the question is; what kind of printed
    matter / publication is it?\r\n\r\nIn all other cases you should contact the designer
    / distributor. If you're meaning to make money off it, I think it's probably safe
    to say it's not allowed in most cases.\r\n\r\n"
