  letters, a charity font project which will sell a CD to raise cash to build two
  orphanages for kids with Aids in Africa. <BR> <BR>Anyway, the project is now just
  a few weeks from launching, and we are wondering about price. <BR> <BR>The CD Pack
  contains : <BR> <BR>A magazine, A5, 32 pages with writings on Africian font design,
  font design, interviews. <BR> <BR>A2 &#40;Big&#41; Posters by Max Kisman, David
  Carson and Joshusa Davis <BR> <BR>A disk with around 20 fonts on it, by Max Kisman,
  P22, Baseline Fonts, Positype, Union Fonts, Fontmonster, SignalGrau, Thistype ...
  etc <BR> <BR>and a Christmas dingbat with icons created by Neville Brody, Erik Spiekermann,
  Joreg Alderete... etc <BR> <BR>We are not sure about the pricing for this, does
  $35 Including Post and Packaging sound like something you&#39;d be prepared to pay?'

    $50 and probably more. I belong to a public radio station WBGO &#40;one of the
    last Jazz only stations in  the US&#41; and the base membership is $50 and all
    you get is the music and a spotty newsletter. Their push is the tax deduction,
    as they put it do you want to give it to WBGO or the IRS. dan

  body: $35 seems like a nice, not-too-expensive-but not-too-cheap price range. <BR>
    <BR>Or maybe do the CD for $50 and a downloadable version for $35.
