body: I've been using Fontlab Studio 5.2 for compiling OpenType features. But my generated
  fonts only work in Notepad and some Adobe softwares such as Photoshop, InDesign,
  Illustrator,... I can't have it work in Microsoft Office or Manga Studio. For example,
  I can't have the Katakana prolonged sound mark turn vertical in a vertical text
  line. Only original fonts such as Arial, Times New Roman, MS Mincho, MS Gothic,...
  and other commercial fonts can work well. Do you have any idea what's the thing
  I have to deal with? Thanks in advance.

    using. Please also note that most people are unfamiliar with Katakana, so further
    information about the issues you faced would also help.\r\n\r\nA general remark:
    many applications still do not support OpenType, while others include just partial
    support. Full access to OT resources seem limited to InDesign, Illustrator and
    Quark, ALAIK. Anyway, if this feature works in other fonts, this shouldn't be
    the problem.\r\n\r\nAnother point is that FL Studio 5.2 is still a beta, so it
    is expected not to work perfectly. Have you tried to generate the font with FLS
    5.0.x?\r\n"

  body: There are some features of OpenType that MS Word can handle, but you have
    to jump through hoops to make it happen. I think with Word you even have to tell
    it if you want kerning to come in.

  body: "I have been down this path, with regard to vertical writing in MS Word.\r\n\r\nFor
    reasons unknown, at least to me, MS Word requires that an OpenType/CFF font include
    the 'vrt2' GSUB feature. MS Word is simply checking for its presence. If the font
    does not include this GSUB feature, I suggest that you clone the 'vert' GSUB feature
    to create the 'vrt2' GSUB feature."
