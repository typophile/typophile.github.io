  works. Sorry, in advance, if I'm out of line.\r\n\r\nGot two typefaces in the attached
  images. Would love to know what they are.\r\n\r\nDUNDERDON looks pretty close to
  Helvetica, but the R is different.\r\n\r\nADAM KIMMEL, I'm totally unsure.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help. Super grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
