body: "Greater Albion Typefounders has just launched 'Corton' a pair of display Roman
  small capitals faces.  \r\n\r\nCorton was inspired by the traditional lettering
  on a gravestone in an English village.  While that might sound a rather solemn beginning,
  Corton has wonderfully lively air, with distinctive lively serifs and beautifully
  swashed downstrokes.  Two faces are offered-regular and titular.  Between them they
  are ideal signage and display faces, merging 'olde-worlde' charm and fun character.\r\n\r\nCorton
  is currently available through [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/corton/ | Myfonts]],
  and is offered at a 35% introductory discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Corton_Gallery4_5536.png]"

  body: Beautiful. I could see some nice applications for this. The "2" sticks out
    for me a bit, it looks more awkward than the rest, but great work overall.

  body: Steven,  Thanks for your kind words......maybe you've got something about
    the "2", perhaps we'll give it some more thought when we expand the family...
