  for, and am looking for tools. I've seen the Fontwise site, and tried their little
  standalone demo, but wasn't overly impressed and am seeking other options. Is anyone
  aware of alternative network font audit tools? I could just write some scripts,
  but I bet there are good tools out there already. Please share your experiences
  and recommendations!\r\n\r\nThanks."

    what they were called or the web address, however. maybe someone will know what
    i'm talking about.\r\n\r\n*edit*\r\nI found what i was looking for. It was the
    VisiBone Automated Font Survey. I'm not sure if this will do what you need, but
    perhaps it's worth a look: http://www.visibone.com/font/tests.html"

    machines at once and create some sort of summary. I've been looking, and Fontwise
    may indeed be the only thing that does this. I'd love to be corrected on this.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."
