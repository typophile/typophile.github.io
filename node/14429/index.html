The reason is that there is no post record column to the right of it lie there is for all the other forums in the &ldquo;Forums&rdquo; landing page. Is there a reason for this? To me it is helpful to see the most recent post and time to cue me to go check it. I know we are still in Beta and I don&rsquo;t mean to cause a fuss.  I am just asking.</p>

<p>Some of the work that gets posted there is quite good, and worth a look. Like Paul&rsquo;s posts, for instance.</p>
<p>Some of it is not as interesting, but there are lots of threads in General Discussion that I don&rsquo;t follow either, so…</p>

Now knowing that the Critique site is live, there is no problem for me.  My question is more about why is the Critique area treated differently than Design or General? I just wonder why, when developing a hopefully consistant user interface, one would choose to treat Critique as a child of a lesser God?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tina, I&rsquo;ve seen your sentiment expressed a few times lately, and while the critique forums could be livelier than they are, I think you&rsquo;re being a bit unfair.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to chime in on general topics, mostly because we&rsquo;re just spouting off our opinions. It&rsquo;s a lot closer to casual conversation than any formal kind of discourse, and while a lot of information is shared, not a lot of deep thought is required to participate. The type identification forums are as lively as they are because the regular posters have turned it into a competition, which makes it a fun and addictive experience for them.</p>
<p>Providing useful feedback, on the other hand, is hard. I participate in the font critique forums as often as I can, because I always find the experience at least as educational to me as the person I&rsquo;m critiquing. It&rsquo;s enlightening to puzzle out why I have certain kinds of reactions to certain features in a font. But it still takes time, and given how casual and informal a lot of the participation is on Typophile, it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that there&rsquo;s not more participation in critiques.</p>
<p>It would be cool if the critique threads were livelier, but I think it&rsquo;s a bit unfair to suggest that the Critique area is dead. Was my feedback on your new typeface not useful to you?</p>

<p>make action in the critique forums more visible. since i don&rsquo;t get email replies any more and the rss feeder only sends the first message of new threads (correct me if i&rsquo;m wrong) and the new posts don&rsquo;t show up on the main forums page, i rarely think to check to see if anything is new. my new metod of keeping up involves just scanning the forums page to see what sections have had recent posts.</p>

I, at the time, had not even seen his font posted for critique. Until the new version of Typophile, I had been a regular poster in the Critique area both as a critiquer and a critiquee.

This current version we have to click a lot more and therefore we &ldquo;see less stuff&rdquo;. I think this feature on this new typophile would be A LOT better for all. Is that difficult to implement? If the file is uploades I guess it&rsquo;s not difficult to pace it with the [img] [/img] rather than a link&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant correctly pointed out that the critique statistics aren&rsquo;t surfacing to the top level index because there are sub categories (sub folders). This is an unfortunate bug.</p>
<p>Image posting and search were the hottest bugs being addressed. Search has been implemented and image posting is very close. Honestly the only aspect that has us from pushing the feature live is the fact that we cannot yet control what happens when people post overly wide images &ndash; currently it would blow out the page widths (column widths) again. So, which peeve is worse, not seeing images in-line or having your column widths blown to full screen? Right then. The only answer is to implement the image posting the right way&hellip;</p>
<p>Old versus new. I know some people still miss the old site &ndash; I don&rsquo;t. The reality of the situation is that the system was choking on itself. The database actually stored HTML pages instead of raw content &ndash; a recipe for bloating badly. Consider the fact that when Christian ported the data from the old system to the new he deleted a gigabyte of the &ldquo;DoNotLookLikeCrap&rdquo; style tags (and that was just the style tags!).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve asked our newest moderator Dan Reynolds to help the situation by pointing out the best fonts currently up for critique. He will be able to do this by flagging the best ones too be served up on the home page in the &ldquo;Handpicked&rdquo; column.</p>
<p>Something we tried over a year ago was live chat sessions with a live critique. We&rsquo;d select a font in the critique forum and invite the designer to prepare some additional materials for a Thursday lunchtime live critique session. Then during the designated hour we&rsquo;d have at it. I know the people who got critiqued really valued it. There was also something cool about it being more of an event, with everybody participating at the same time.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is there any interest in this?</p>

I think that the font in question should be posted a few days ahead of time so commenters  can have a chance to think about it an collect helpful links.  The only other question is timing.  We are a worldwide bunch&ndash;when is the &ldquo;best time&rdquo; to do it?</p>
<p>Back to image size&ndash;is there a way to reject posting an image if it is over the max width you want?  Can there be an error message which says something like &ldquo;images may not exceed x pixels by x pixels&rdquo;? After that, a hand come out of the screen and slaps you silly :-)</p>

<p>To me at least, definitely the former. I&rsquo;m a content guy.</p>

<p>A truly live session isn&rsquo;t possible (I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;yet&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m afraid to make promises). We&rsquo;ve looked into chat modules but the real difficulty is finding something that works with people&rsquo;s existing usernames. Aside from something truly live, I would expect the critique would be greatly improved if we simply took the steps of <strong>a)</strong> designating Thursday critique day and <strong>b)</strong> have a moderator (Dan!) alert people to the brightest work up for critique.</p>
<p>Perhaps Dan could add a tag to the critique subject lines similar to the way Yves adds (x) to the Type IDs that are completed. A subject might look like &ldquo;Magnitude - THURSDAY CRIT&rdquo;. (Then when it&rsquo;s over we can change the subject line back.)</p>

<p>I think that making Thursday &ldquo;Typophile critique day&rdquo; is an excellent idea. We could start right away (err… meaning next Thursday, instead of today). What if we selected one work from each category (or there abouts…)?</p>
<p>Another question: do &ldquo;Logos/Corporate ID Design&rdquo; and &ldquo;Typography/Composition&rdquo; <em>need</em> a crit day? Those zones are quite popular already, but they aren&rsquo;t typeface related, per se. Are we prioritizing, or trying to boost everything equally?</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions (including your own work) for crit day, I&rsquo;m all eyes. Otherwise I&rsquo;ll propably be picking those that catch my attention…</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page you could have a &lsquo;critiques&rsquo; subtitle, and then the following categories: Serif; Sans serif; Script, Bitmap &amp; Blackletter; Logos &amp; Corporate ID; Typography &amp; Composition.

<p>Thus you would have only 5 more lines on the front page, and get indications of activity. Or you could put it as Critique: Serif,

<p>I agree. It&rsquo;s just a question of what compromise works best. Given the number of posts, I think a combined category could accomodate say two or three active &lsquo;build&rsquo; threads and one active &lsquo;release&rsquo; thread, which is what tends to happen. I am also grateful for Tiffany&rsquo;s leadship on the EULA issue.</p>
