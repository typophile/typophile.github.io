  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings, I need your help.  Greetings, <BR> <BR>I have been a huge fan of Cassady &amp; Greens Fluent Laser Fonts fort many years.  I purchased the set of diskettes with the Postscript, etc. fonts way back when and have been using them ever since.  As time went on I upgraded my Macs and now of course have no floppy drives. &ndash; though I still have the diskettes.  <BR> <BR>I have been using Gazelle FLF as part of my header and still love that font as well as many others.  But as I copied fonts from one computer to another &ndash; it now appears as GazelleFLF-fog. and just does not work any longer in the version of InDesign I am now using. <BR> <BR>I was so disappointed to discover that C&amp;G is no longer in business.  I am sad to seee that these fonts may be lost to the world.  I have been trying to find Gazelle in a TT font for the mac &ndash; I am looking everywhere.  I hate to see this beautiful font no longer available &ndash; can anyone help? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>David  (<a href="mailto:drice4@ix.netcom.com"><a href="mailto:drice4@ix.netcom.com">drice4@ix.netcom.com</a></a>)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I actually have these fonts also. Can't remember when I used them last. One of the first &quot;collections&quot; we licensed back in the day, the day we switched to mac. Hehe. If you do have the original floppies, I would suggest heading to a local Kinko's (or similar) and re-copy from the orginal to a zip or cd which you can read on your machine.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't have those - but the topic peeked my interest. During my education, the typography teacher told us about one of the first sets, I want to say Charlemange, but I know that's not it - and now I can't remember, but she mentioned that she has never ever been able to find a visual of the typeface (a career of about 20 years then) and placed to us a challenge to find it. Its been over 5 years now that I've known this, but I guess knowing the name would help eh?  - if I heard it I'd probably remember again.  <BR> <BR>In any case its always been in the back of my mind - this original typeface lost to the world&hellip;must find. Anyone know what I'm talking about and is there a visual somewhere? <BR> <BR>I know it starts with a C. <BR> <BR>To think a face is absolutely gone is odd isin't it. I heard that since Letraset stopped producing the transfers many faces are lapsing while they digitize only a select few. Scary thought, shouldn't there be a conservatory dept under the TDC, or FontBureau or something.</div>
