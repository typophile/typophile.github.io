  Fass, who was from my hometown of Lititz, PA.\r\n\r\nI am trying to identify the
  names of some 1960s Typophiles who appear in some photos taken by A. Burton Carnes
  and others.\r\n\r\nI temporarily loaded images here:\r\nhttp://www.yourantiques.com/TypophileFotos.html\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can identify any of these Typophiles, I would certainly appreciate it.  (One
  of these guys seems to be Paul Bennett.)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nLee Stoltzfus\r\nLititz,
  PA\r\n\r\nMy printing history website:\r\nhttp://www.lancasterlyrics.com"

    sure he would be #9.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a little hard to tell from a profile. The
    best image I have is head-on (from his \u201CPi Channel\u201D column in <em>Publisher\u2019s
    Weekly</em>). I have another where PAB is identified in profile, but that image
    is not as good. Still, I\u2019m pretty sure that this is the same person as your
    #9.\r\n\r\nHTH."
