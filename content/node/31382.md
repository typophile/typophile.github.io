body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nFallen at the first hurdle I'm afraid - I'm trying to copy a compound
  path from illustrator into the glyph window (that is, the window that comes up when
  I double click on a letter),  but what pastes in is a shadowy striped version of
  the shape, not an editable path, and it doesn't show up in the main window with
  all the glyphs. It comes out different every time so there's def something wrong
  but I can't fathom it. I've checked Illustrator prefs - preserve paths is on. Also
  tried non compound paths.\r\n\r\nI should prob mention that to begin with I've just
  opened up Helvetica and have saved it as a new document elsewhere, cuz when I tried
  to make a new file none of the glyphs were labelled. I'm probably not supposed to
  do that, eh, but I have modified paths before so I didn't think that would matter(?)\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas much appreciated!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nOrla"
