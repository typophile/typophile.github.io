  body: We just did one like this a couple of days ago. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/interfacer/"
    target="_blank">Interfacer</a> from T-26 was mentioned, and this time I think
    it was the one used. Some of the &#39;maelstrom&#39; letters were built with Interfacer
    characters.
