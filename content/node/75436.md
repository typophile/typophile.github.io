  body: "Not Akzidenz. It looks like something done with an old analog lettering template.\r\n\r\nA
    digital counterpart would be something like Lineto's Gravur Condensed."

  body: My mistake. I just navigated through Lineto's page views to get to Gravur
    and noticed my browser's URL hadn't changed, so I assumed it was Flash. I didn't
    see the permalink on the bottom of their navigation box.
