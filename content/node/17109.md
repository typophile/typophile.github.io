  body: That's what prompted the question, actually. I haven't seen another sans that
    similar to Celeste Sans, and was curious about other combinations that may have

    with a serif instead?

  body: I think I confused you, Patty. He is starting with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=celeste">FF
    Celeste</a>, a serif.
