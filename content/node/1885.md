body: Hello, I came accross this forum while trying to track down a site that offers
  the MetaPlus font.  I&#39;ve searched on all the big font sites &#40;Fonts.com,
  MyFonts.com, Adobe Type Library, etc&#41; but no one seems to offer this font for
  sale or otherwise.  Is there something I&#39;m missing?   <BR> <BR>I really need
  it as a project I&#39;ve been handed was started using the MetaPlus font. Alternatly,
  what would be a comparable font that I could substitute with? <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Chris

  body: You can also buy the font online at fontshop.com and fontshop.de -- downloadable,
    if I remember correctly. Meta had been way overused &#40;at leats in Germany&#41;
    for a while, but I think that period is over and one can use the typeface again
    without it being too obvious a fashion thingie.  <BR> <BR>I

  body: '<i>&#62; Actually, many of Erik&#39;s fonts look quite similar,  <BR>Officina,
    Info, Meta, Unit -- while all distinctively  <BR>different, they all share certain
    similarities.</i> <BR> <BR>Some further theorizing and reactions from Erik himself  <BR>at
    <a href="http://typographi.ca/000622.php#000622" target="_blank"> Typographi.ca</a>.
    <BR> <BR>Originally, back in 1991 when the very first batch of  <BR>FontFonts
    was released, there was <b>FF Meta 1</b> &#40;Normal,  <BR>Bold, Small Caps&#41;.
    Hanging figures and additional  <BR>ff-ligatures were already present in the Normal
    and  <BR>Bold weights, with lining figures in the Small Caps. <BR> <BR>The first
    expansion came in 1992 with <b>FF Meta 2</b>  <BR>{Italic, Italic Small Caps,
    Bold Small Caps}. <BR> <BR><b>FF MetaPlus</b>, released in 1993, was the big leap  <BR>forward
    which tripled the number of fonts to 18, and  <BR>included a fine-tuning of some
    characters &#40;most notably  <BR>the correction of the crossbar on the lc &#39;t&#39;&#41;.
    The family  <BR>at that point featured Normal, Book, Medium, Bold and  <BR>Black
    weights, all in Roman, Italic, Small Caps and  <BR>Italic Small Caps &#40;except
    for the Black weight which  <BR>didn&#39;t include Small Caps&#41;. Still hanging
    figures in <BR>the &#39;normal&#39; weights and lining figures in the Small Caps.
    <BR> <BR>Eventually, in 1998 it was back to <b>FF Meta</b>, which  <BR>saw a reorganization
    of the family into subfamilies:  <BR>FF MetaNormal, FF MetaBook, FF MetaMedium,  <BR>FF
    MetaBold and FF MetaBlack, all in Roman, Italic,  <BR>Small Caps and Italic Small
    Caps, which all got  <BR>coupled with their respective Expert and Lining Figures  <BR>weights:
    yep, 60 fonts indeed. Biggest change this  <BR>time was the addition of the Black
    Small Caps, and  <BR>moving the extra ligatures &#40;ff, ffi, ffl which were  <BR>previously
    in the regular fonts&#41; to the new Expert fonts. <BR>And of course the Lining
    figures weights which means <BR>you don&#39;t have to switch weights anymore to
    get the  <BR>desired type of numerals. <BR> <BR>So, to conclude: don&#39;t mix
    the original six weight  <BR>FF Meta with FF MetaPlus nor the new FF Meta family  <BR>&#40;different
    spacing, some redesigned characters&#41;, and  <BR>when substituting FF Meta for
    FF MetaPlus be careful  <BR>with disappearing ff-ligatures and different types
    of  <BR>numerals. <BR> <BR>This concludes the lecture for today &#40;whew&#41;.

  body: Hi after reading your posts, &#40;which were very helpful by the way&#41;I
    am still confused. <BR> <BR>I am looking for the MetaPlus font for PC, and all
    I have been able to find is the Meta 1,2,3 fonts.  &#40;Even on the Fontfont website.&#41;
    Is the Meta 1 font the same thing as MetaPlus? <BR> <BR>I appreciate your help.

  body: Jennifer -- <BR> <BR>As Yves explained &#40;quite thoroughly and admirably&#41;,
    Meta 1, 2, 3, and MetaPlus are all essentially the same typeface family. But MetaPlus
    was an earlier release. If you are trying to work with a legacy document which
    uses MetaPlus, then you should contact one of the FontShops directly to get a
    copy of the old version, as the recent versions have some subtle differences.
    <BR> <BR>I had to help a client in this situation once. After getting them a license
    for Meta 1 and 2, I spoke with a representative at FontShop who gladly provided
    a legacy copy of MetaPlus at no additional cost, in order to work with documents
    that an outside firm had designed using MetaPlus. <BR> <BR>If you are not working
    with a previous document and don&#39;t need to worry about changes in metrics,
    then Meta 1 and 2 are the current versions which match &#40;and exceed&#41; the
    range of MetaPlus. <BR> <BR>

    figured out.  Unfortunately ALL of the company&#39;s promotional materials use
    the old MetaPlus font family.  Do you think it would be worthwhile to switch them
    over to the newer font? <BR> <BR>-J
