    \r\n\r\nAnyway: Cityof comes from <a href=\"http://www.railfonts.com/cgi-bin/font_shop/fontshop.cgi?ACTION=enter&thispage=page10.html#\">Railfonts</a>
    a site which digitizes old fonts from trains, I think. \r\n\r\nCityof was obviously
    made by <a href=\"http://www.railfonts.com/Info/designers.html\">Benn Coifman</a>"

  body: Thanks Renko, I appreciate it's evil! It's just a shame that when you search
    for 'Cityof font' all you get is pages and pages of links to free download sites.

  body: "The font is described by its creator, Benn Coifman, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Compare
    to the lettering used by the Union Pacific Railroad on its freight and passenger
    trains since the late 1930's. Also once used by the Milwaukee Road for their passenger
    trains. The font is versatile enough to use in documents or on models. Includes
    small caps, accents and full punctuation.\"\r\n\r\nThe font NAME was probably
    based on \"The City of New Orleans\". The City of New Orleans was a passenger
    train of the Illinois Central line, and was celebrated in a song sung and recorded
    \ by Arlo Guthrie and later, Willie Nelson.\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
