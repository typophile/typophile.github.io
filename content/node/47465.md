  in international type specimen books. I am aware of the Oak Knoll book sellers.\r\n\r\nCan
  you please recommend some of your favorite type house specimen books from the last
  two centuries. I have a few older ATF type specimen books and would like to expand
  my reference library with a broader international scope.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSal

    of great stuff turns up on eBay, but you\u2019ll only win the auctions if you
    use sniping software to get bids in thirty seconds before auctions end."
