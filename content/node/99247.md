  monogram logo for the Zemaitis guitar company. It was most likely a hand-lettering
  and no one could come up with a typeface. \r\n\r\nHowever, they definitely use a
  typeface for the label inside their guitars. Can anyone identify it? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nBobby\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zemaitis_label_6308.jpg]"
