body: "Letraset had an experiment some twenty years ago which drove users crazy. To
  protect their software, they had programmed the fonts to be installed only 5 times.
  After that they were, like, <em>dead.</em> I remember FontShop had the occasional
  hysterical customer saying \"I've installed it 4 times already and it's still not
  working, I've only got one chance left!\" Needless to say, the experiment was never
  taken up in the industry.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have more precise information about
  this technology, and did this font format have a specific name?"

  body: Sorry, I don't have the answer to your question, but this got me thinking
    about protecting fonts from piracy. I wonder how difficult it would be to embed
    licensing restrictions in fonts, similar to songs you would download from iTunes,
    where the font can only be authorized on however many computers at a time. Am
    I missing some obvious reason for not doing something like that?

    companies (Microsoft, Apple and \"the likes\") as well as those in the entertainment
    industry (Music, movies, Hollywood and the celebrities) make tons of money anyway,
    so it won't harm them if I don't spend an extra $150 to download their product.
    What's wrong with rich people like them to spare a poor guy like me?\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    people also wrongly identify the font design industry as one of those who makes
    tons of money, since most people don't have a clue about font design business
    and they think that anything to do with IT business make lots of money. \r\n\r\nI
    know at least that is the mentality of many who lives in this part of the world-
    ASIA, where piracy are rampant!\r\n\r\nLegal enforcement and education from the
    government sometimes help in my country. \r\n\r\nweng"
