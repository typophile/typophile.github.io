  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey guys,

I have been visiting the websites of some typeface designers who regularly answer here so that i can get a feel of what they do and all. But most of the websites look ghastly. They are very difficult on the eyes. I am not going to take any names here (they are very very famous in these forums) but what is the point in setting the type at 8 pt? and the colors/graphics are not really appealing.  Why?

Regards

But -as you imply- I'm not alone... Why? Because designing type and designing a site require vastly different skills and talents (it's rare for a single individual to enjoy both) and too many of us try to do it ourselves instead of biting the bullet and hiring a bona fide site designer. This is probably generally due to a combination of saving money (type design is not highly lucrative) and a certain pride in designing things ourselves.

		<div class="commentbody">That’s not a fair comment.
If you’re not prepared to name names, your sweeping generalization damns everyone by implication.
I for one can’t possibly have an ugly web site, as it’s only had one page, a brief “under construction”, for quite some time.
Mark Simonson’s site is beautifully detailed, and how can you possibly diss Berlow’s?!—Webtype.com is state of the art web legibility, and Font Bureau is squeaky clean.

I also don’t think that it’s necessary for a foundry site to have “appealing” graphics, as that can get in the way of showing the fonts. Foundry site design should be understated. Functionality is more important.

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps you're not looking hard enough, or your standards/tastes are different than mine. Some type designers' sites are more technically ambitious than others, but there are plenty good-looking examples out there, even among one- or two-person shops: Eric Olson (Process), Kris Sowersby (Klim), Mark Simonson (MS Studio), James Montalbano (Terminal Design), Mark von Bronkhorst (MVB Fonts), Dino Dos Santos (DSType), Tomas Brousil (Suitcase Type), etc.

Nick, I'm sure your site will be worthy of mention once it's back up. :)</div>

As i have mentioned famous people, i have Hrant here and John Hudson( two of the most knowledgeable people around here). Oldnick's website just has a plea to get him out of a tough situation(i hope he is out now) Also the foundries like emtype.net(too small font size) and some websites have just the name of the typeface designer(though set in a beautiful typeface). What i should have asked is do people get any customers from websites and if they do then they should not be put off by bad designs/small text.

		<div class="commentbody">The site leading to sales: a search for "Armenian fonts" (the only angle I could hope to really leverage) is hijacked by free crap, so I have to believe that the main advantage of having a bad site is in comparison to not having one at all. A business not having a site is worse than a person not having a cellphone* in terms of people thinking you're some kind of freak they shouldn't touch with a ten foot composing stick.

* Which I know because that's the case with me... Although I admit to having my eyes on the imminent Samsung Note II.

I mean that sincerely, and I’m only saying it because it’s unlikely the moderators have called you to task on all the vulgar insults you’re throwing around.
I don’t think people here are interested in slanging matches, and you’re seriously lowering the tone of the place.
As all those who’ve been to your website know, you’ve had difﬁculties recently.
I would imagine that some people in the industry would be prepared to help you out, but it’s a small community, and you’re not making friends with your present antics. 

Would you be interested in doing production work for other foundries?
It doesn’t generate passive income, but it’s cash in hand, and lots of type designers mix it with their retail development.

One person can be blessed with both sets of talents, but it's simply statistically rare. Most people can't do <em>either</em> very well!  :-)

While talent is important, I think it's more a matter of training and experience. A graphic designer who studied web design in college and designs websites every day is probably going to be much better at it than a type designer who rarely does web design.  And vice versa, of course.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">James, it's hard to figure out whether talent or skill (AKA training & experience) is more important (especially since it's the former than often leads one to the latter) but I certainly agree that skill is very important (which is why I mentioned it in my first post - I just forgot later on).

<blockquote>Knowing all that information doesn't make it any less ugly to the eye.</blockquote>

Only for eyes that are deaf.

<blockquote>How is it statistically rare?</blockquote>

If let's say 10% of people are good at one thing, and 10% are good at something else, 1% will be good at both. Now, there is some overlap between type design and graphic design so the numbers wouldn't be so drastic, but what I'm saying is the overlap is far less than it might seem.

Ryan, my work is hard to find online because it's hard to find anywhere: it's niche, but most of all there frankly isn't much of it (and most of it isn't worth publicizing much). BTW that's probably why some people get flustered and leave Typophile, saying that I don't "deserve" the airtime. I can explain why that logic is flawed, but I'd rather not turn this thread into a discussion of me.

One thing to keep in mind here is that the more niche you are the less likely a "fancy" website matters. We're not selling Toyotas here. Consider this: what kind of people would spontaneously decide to hire John H. if he had a highly sophisticated site? That's not the type of customer he's likely to be useful to. Word of mouth* remains essential for type designers.

* Which luckily no longer has to be done in person.

<blockquote>slow down the speed</blockquote>

Use a medium the way it serves you, and don't try to bend it into something it can't do for you. If you're selling print fonts the best -and perhaps only- thing a site can do for you is leave a positive first impression; the rest has to be done via other channels.

Hrant's work is like nonexistent on the web.  I had to go looking for fonts he designed, using carefully designed google queries, rather than simply being served all his work upon googling his name, other than the few on his site, that is.

My commom sense explain me this because exist at least few powerful reason for this situation:
1. Web desing is very different technical area compared to type design.
2. Most type designer spend long long time working at type design and web design also need long time working at.
3. Most sell activity of type designers occur through another bigger well designed websites (specialist on font  sell business only).
4. The cost of good web design most of the time is high to type designers profits.
5. Web design (code managing) look a problem so complicated, and solve that by simplest (but ugly) way.

I guess the list is bigger but so leave this until here...

I've done my own website design in the past, and I think I was okay at it, but as I've moved more of my focus to type design, I've fallen behind on web design and production techniques. I also find that the more time I spend working on fonts, the less time (and interest) I have for working on my site.

Consequently, I'm working with an outside web designer. (Not sure when the new site will launch.)

Incidentally, the Commercial Type site (which I think is very nice) was not designed by Schwartz or Barnes, but by an outside firm.</div>

I think y'all should get yourself some twitter bootstrap and start tinkering. The world can and will wait for you to complete the Hungarian extension to your typeface...come on, tell me the thought of showing off your typefaces with proper control over your line spacing, drop caps, ligatures and opentype features on the web doesn't make you all a little hot under the collar. Fix up! If anything web-design has gotten easier in the past three years...
Strip everything right back, go for a minimum viable product and slowly introduce content back as you get more confident.

Time is always a concern, and yup, I concur - if you can afford someone who is a specialist, then you definitely should.
That said, it seems HTML is fast becoming the universal format for wrapping and delivering text/information to the masses -  it's our duty to be fairly au fait with it's foibles and capabilities...

I think you can even make a webpage right in Photoshop (and perhaps illustrator) now, right? And if not I know you can take a design from illustrator and import right into flash, keeping all the layers intact. So that means you can design everything visually in Illustrator, including your rollovers, etc, and very quickly use to flash to make your site.  To some extent, animation is more difficult, as well as adding ecommerce.</div>

By your site do you mean what you've ended up copying from Jessica Hische?  Your Material page (http://lifu.co.uk/materiel/) looks a lot like her Resource page (http://jessicahische.is/heretohelp/). As well as your Work page (http://lifu.co.uk/work/) --> http://jessicahische.is

With regard to illustrator vs photoshop for web-design. I guess it's down to preference, although, with responsive things, you really need to go to code as soon as you can for layout.
The [[http://styletil.es|style tiles]] idea seems like the strongest method to decide looks and such.

		<div class="commentbody">Flash has always had compatibility problems.  But if it is going away, it is only because of HTML 5, which whenever it comes around to being fully implemented, could nicely replace it.  Adobe realizes this, and has implemented a 'render' as html5 function.

My real point is that nobody can really use the "i havent been keeping up on the technological changes enough" excuse because one really doesn't need to know much new coding ides, such as jquery, or php, or javascript.  Programming is a very left brain activity, and visual art is a very right brain activity.  There are of course, lots of exceptions to that rule, and there are people who excel equally in abstract mathematical thinking and visual artisiticness, but they are rare.</div>
