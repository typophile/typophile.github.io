  of a paragraph that has found itself all alone at the top of the following page.\r\n\r\nIt
  is NOT a single word at the end of a paragraph on a line by itself.\r\n\r\nYet it
  continually amazes me that art directors, professional designers, and professors
  who teach graphic design do not know this. I encounter daily young designers who
  will take great pains to ensure words like \"combustible\" and \"nationality\" are
  not without company.\r\n\r\nOf course, lone words less than four letters -- please
  don't call them widows, as they are not -- should find their way back among their
  friends, if possible. Otherwise, stop spending precious time trying to solve something
  that is neither an error or a problem. And when I ask you, \"where's my ad?\" don't
  whine and look pleadingly toward Heaven (or the pigeons mating in the rafters) and
  mumble, \"just fixing a few widows; it will only be a minute.\" There are no widows
  in a one-page ad!\r\n\r\nThere. I've said it."

    I checked that Wiki definition, and with a credit to Rob Carter, doesn't it say
    that the term \"widow\" can \"also be used to refer simply to an uncomfortably
    short (e.g. a single word or two very short words) final line of a paragraph?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to refer to the one word last line, and you have to accept that. Or else be the
    annoying designer who lectures all the editors who mark them as \"widows\". Therefore
    becoming someone else's pet peeve.\r\n\r\nMY pet peeve is when you call someone
    on a cell phone instead of just the message and the beep you get: \"to leave a
    message just wait for the tone (yup, got that). When you have finished recording
    you may hang up (um... we know that too) or press 1 for more options (does anybody
    ever do that?). To leave a callback number press 5 (um... isn't our number already
    stored under received calls?) To page this person press pound (anybody EVER do
    that???)\" Meanwhile wasting our precious minutes.\r\n\r\nAnother pet peeve? Friends
    who sit across from each other on the subway instead of next to each other, meaning
    they have to talk very loudly to communicate.\r\n\r\nAnd... people who don't use
    bcc for all the names in the email, instead putting them all in the To line, which
    results in lots of unwanted emails from people hitting \"reply all\"."

    about the \"Masthead\"/flag/nameplate pet peeve? That one gets me all the time,

    both meanings:\r\n\r\n3.\tPrinting.\r\na.\ta short last line of a paragraph, esp.
    one less than half of the full measure or one consisting of only a single word.\r\nb.\tthe
    last line of a paragraph when it is carried over to the top of the following page

    oooh, is this the peeve venting thread? I want to add headline/heading to the
    list. There is no headline on the story at the bottom of page 5. There is only
    one headline in the newspaper. At best you can call the top heading on a section
    front a headline, but no others.\r\n\r\nI agree with Patty on the fact that widow
    technically is any short line, and has only come to mean the first line at the
    top of a page over time. Donald Knuth, in the TeXbook, also talks about something
    called a club line (along with widows and orphans). I have never run across that
