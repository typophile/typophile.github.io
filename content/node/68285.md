body: "Hello All\u2013\r\nHaving a complete mental block today about a typeface I
  have previously used it on an invite and own it. It's a Tri Line face which isn't
  rounded so unlike Gala or Pump. Quite plain in a way with a bit of a 30s feel to
  it, condensed. I have seen it used before where a designer had knocked some of the
  lines out to create different versions of the face. Any help appreciated, driving
  me up the wall."

    Gala.\r\n\r\nBut the main thing is you did get your answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
