  body: interesting idea . . . however, i would&#39;ve never been able to read what
    it said without knowing the name of the company. Maybe take the idea but refine
    it in a way that makes the name legible.

  body: 'I agree with Sally, the mark is difficult to read. I can maybe see the &#34;l&#34;
    and &#34;e&#34; without knowing the word.  However, I like the exploration you&#39;re
    doing with the type and think that you could be on to something.  Taking the idea
    of the word &#34;pulse&#34; could offer up some interesting solutions.  What about
    establishing a rhythm in the design that helps distinguish one letter from the
    next. You could play with varying baselines or the idea of alternating letters
    getting closer and further away.  I should also say that I like the way the &#34;s&#34;
    and &#34;e&#34; are connected in your 2nd example.  '

  body: 'The mark would have no future, unless most people could read it within a
    couple of seconds. <BR> <BR>Take a look around: it will take you weeks to find
    a trademark used professionally with an equally low legibility. <BR> <BR>When
    presented with a riddle giving the notion that this can&#39;t be easily solved,
    the spectator turns his head away and looks at something else. <BR> <BR>I think
    you should go a different direction. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>S'

    interesting one. I had played around with the letters expanding and contracting
    alternatively. Im just finding it quite difficult to get all the letters to flow..

  body: Like the others who have posted, I was unable to read your initial typeforms,
    but this latter concept is much more legible. I think I like it

  body: alex--i really like the direction of this new logo. much more legible, overall
    a cleaner more professional logo. i am not quite sure if the variation in dot
    colors is working -- it is so gradual that is not that noticable . . . it seems
    as though it would not be noticed unless the logo was quite large, etc. especially
    the dot in the &#34;p&#34; -- it is hard to notice even when the logo is large.

  body: The first logo is too cryptic, I agree with Sally, that it is very hard to
    read, especially for an untrained eye. The latest post is much more legible, but
    still takes a bit too much effort to read for the avarage person. Imagine this
    logo in use on say a delivery truck, driving at 40mph and people trying to read
    it in a busy street. Consider all uses from web, signage, catalogs, b/w, color
    reproduction, etc... and think about this from the userbility  <BR>aspect of the
    design versus the creative/artistic aspect. <BR>I did design for a similar type
    of client last year. Simplicity is  <BR>sometimes the best approach. Like all
    work it is important to consider end user/consumer instead of just delivering
    something client/company likes. You are in the business of solving communication
    issues and not an artist. Consider how this company would grow with the identity
    you create. Test it <BR>in black and white. small and large scale, blur it a bit
    to see how it would be recognized by someone with poor eyesight, dyslexia, etc...You
    can charge more money with this approach and make you business more profit, ands
    serve your client&#39;s needs better. <BR>As for what you have done so far. It
    is very nice and artistic and I personally like it, even though that really doesn&#39;t
    matter.

    make a mark thats abstract that represents pulse. '

    project. The logotype that has been chosen by the client is <BR>much more simple
    and legible. It still, I hope implies meaning, being both structural and pulsing.

    have the legibility issues that the others did, and the break in the letterforms
    implies a pulse'

  body: Scott, Im glad it got across that meaning. <BR> <BR>The end section is cut
    from the colour block and placed above the contact details at the bottom of A4
    correspondance etc.. And also above the text on the reverse of the business card.
    Im using the removed bit from the &#34;e&#34; as a building block which is placed
    elsewhere to balance the design.
