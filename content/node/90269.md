  pic. i believe they did a crowd source type deal. the owner likes it, but the friends
  dislikes very much. primarily because he's a promotions guy and feels it doesn't
  represent the company visually very well.\r\n\r\ni don't like for many reasons technical
  issues, but i do like the idea. just needs some simplifying and tuning. one issue,
  they already launched so a complete overhaul was not an option. kept the font and
  space needle idea. incorporated an equalizer concept for city landscape. thoughts
  on the revision. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/JC_4595.jpg]"

  body: "I think your version is a definite improvement on the crowd-sourced logo,
    but you could push it a little further.\r\n\r\nI agree with hrant, the city landscape
    doesn't really say equalizer to me at the moment, take a look at this for inspiration:
    [[http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-6704374/stock-vector-graphic-equalizer-vector.html]]\r\n\r\nI
    also think you've lost something by focusing on the very top of the space needle,
    making it less identifiable. Perhaps try another version showing more of the space
    needle, as in the first logo version.\r\n\r\nAnd, as hrant stated, the spacing
    on 'Jet City' needs some work. \r\n\r\nHope that helps"

    a physical location.\r\n- what a jet has to do with anything.\r\n- why your space
    needle looks like a hamburger.\r\n- why people think that crowd sourcing is a
    good idea."

  body: "hrant - agree, JET CITY needs help. i might reintroduce a font instead or
    tweek this one a bit more. \r\n\r\npeter_b - thanks for the link. i'll have to
    give that shot. i like the idea of an equalizer and many the squares loses readability.
    \r\n\r\nluma - jet city, comes from Boeing manufacturing location based out of
    seattle area. can't tell you much more then that. but my guess they choose the
    name based on Boeing. hamburger, i guess i was hungry at the time i designed it.
    jeez! or Cheese.  =)  agree crowd sourcing is never a good idea... but most people
    don't know better.\r\n\r\nthanks everyone."

    that many logos have levels of details and it's not necessarily a disaster if
