body: "Hey folks,\r\n\r\nLately I have been looking for a sans-serif with rather specific
  properties: a character set covering many languages</a> (including at least Polish,
  Turkish and Czech), small cap figures</a> (desirably proportional and tabular) and
  as wide a range of weights as possible</a> (more than two, preferably each with
  corresponding italics). I thought the list I put together might be useful to others.
  And I hope for additions and corrections, this compilation being far from exhaustive.
  Display fonts are excluded on purpose.\r\n\r\nThe list gives the name of the typeface
  as well as\u2014in brackets\u2014the foundry that has issued it and, if necessary,
  some detail on the small cap figures.\r\n<!--break-->\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://ourtype.com/#/try/alto/\">Alto</a>

  body: Just out of curiosity, would you mind sharing why you would like to have both
    proportional *and* tabular small caps figures? I've been wondering about possible
    uses for those (and I think there was a thread or two too, asking whether [or
    for what] they're needed), so it'd be useful to hear about a real-life usage scenario.

  body: "Of course, this is a frequent question. I use proportional small cap numerals
    in running text when figures are adjacent and belonging to letters in (all) small
    caps. This is regularly the case in those scientific publications that prefer
    the \u2018Smith 2009\u2019 format for references. Fixed-width small cap figures,
    on the other hand, render it possible in tables to reach a certain degree of optical
    evenness (that obviously cannot be obtained with old-style numerals) and to keep
    the line height moderate at the same time (which would not be possible with taller
    lining figures and majuscules). Just have a look at the following example (the
    typeface is John Hudson\u2019s Constantia):\r\n<strong></strong>\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/table_3843.png]\r\n<strong></strong>\r\nFurther

    just for making tables smaller and still look good, \u2013 would it also be an
    option to use lining nums and capital letters, at a smaller point size, in a typeface
    that has optically adjusted cuts, such as caption/footnote styles? Limits your

    as long as you have a slightly bolder weight at hand. And that\u2019s where I
    have encountered problems: Optical sizes are usually too close to each other in
    terms of stroke width, whereas semibold cuts often tend to look too dark. At precisely
    this point, tabular small cap figures come in. Alas, they are comparatively rare
    in sans-serif typefaces (though not as rare as I thought them to be before compiling
    this list), but so are optical sizes.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the fonts in the current
    version of the list seem to offer both proportional and tabular small cap numerals&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;among
    them such different typefaces as Neutraface, Grotext, Seravek and Morris Sans.
    It\u2019s admittedly a limited selection, but I expect it to grow over the years.
    Small cap figures apparently and, to my mind, deservedly see an increase in popularity.\r\n"

    or otherwise) so I am interested if there traction to this trend...\r\n\r\nI have
    been working recently on developing the Bembo Model (Italian Renaissance) partly
    to get my head into italics and scripts.\r\nI show for your interest a first draft
    [below] \u2013 which shows my current thinking on numbers for a text face - being
    four basic Number sets.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bembo-Model_4582.png]\r\n\r\nI
    was thinking of calling the Default smallish example \"Tabloid\" - but that would
    just be confusing! Now that we have so much control over numbers - I see offering
    a 'smallish' set as a good option. I used to find the slightly smaller Figures
    in the early Helvetica intriguing though their size was less aesthetic and more
    to allow them to fit into a tabular system. Can anyone confirm this? \r\n\r\nAnyway
    I am very much into the default figures adopting a natural and unforced form -
    this I think has been achieved when you compare the smallish default set to the
    'standard' tabular lining figures (which historically have tended to be offered
    as the default in the Bembos from Adobe and Berthold. (This may not be true of
    Monotype Bembo Book?). This thread is showing that this practice is becoming less
    acceptable for professional/typographic enduse fonts."

    space (small caps). Match that with making them bold and you can see why small
    caps figures are not so prevalent. \r\n\r\nYou (as a designer) have to consider
    and allow the most difficult detail occurrences in glyph construction to inform
    the detailing for the rest of the typeface. Why set the bar where it becomes so
    much more difficult to accomplish a design scheme or makes you compromise the
    rest of the glyphs? \r\n\r\nR. - I think it is good to lead by example - Since

  body: "Thanks for your response, Michael.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I am quite satisfied with
    what is currently on offer. Most problems concerning small cap figures seem to
    have been solved already by ingenious colleagues. My motivation to post above
    list did not arise from discontent with fonts I knew; it is just recommendable
    to gain a comprehensive overview of available typefaces before making any decisions,
    I think. Your suggestion to draw a set of figures myself is valuable, nonetheless.\r\n\r\nFurther
    contributions to the list remain welcome. Most recent addition: VoiceOS by Hubert
    Jocham&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;nice one.\r\n\r\nP.S.: Here comes an example of tabular
    small cap figures in a sans-serif typeface (Calibri by Lucas de Groot, another
    ClearType font):\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/table_5869.png]"

  body: "Actually, although Nick Shinn only has proportional small cap figures (roman
    and italic) in <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/figgins.html\">Figgins Sans</a>,
    he also includes authentic nineteenth-century three-quarter-height figures (roman
    and italic) in both proportional and tabular spacing.\r\n\r\nAlso, his <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/scotch.html\">Scotch
    Modern</a> also has small cap figures (roman and italic, proportional only) and
    three-quarter-height figures (roman and italic, proportional and tabular).\r\n\r\nExtra
    kudos for also including nut fractions in both of them, along with superiors and
    inferiors and numerators and denominators. Both faces are rich in figures. Nicely
    done, Mr. Shinn."
