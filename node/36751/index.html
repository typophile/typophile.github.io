<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
I wondered if you might have some ideas on this rough BW logo design i've done. I need to align and tidy up, but wanted to find out what you all thought. I work in print mainly these days, however when I registered the name I was doing more new media.
I wanted to reflect the following key words:
professional
forward moving
Clean
Works black and white and colour
fluid
timeless
fresh
solid
print and new media
I've keep the play symbol small as I don't want to reflect new media too much more a balance. Although the font is 1970's est I think it does give a modern feel. Do you think there is a better way to go, more symbolistic way, using more of the play button logo.
Cheers for your thoughts

<div class=commentbody>I like the fact that it has an idea behind it. Honestly, I've seen controls such as play, pause, ff, etc., used many, many times, but the fact your logo is something more than just a typeface counts for a lot in my book.
Personally, and this is totally subjective, I think the font looks dated and sorta stale. But that's just me. What matters most is if you like it and can live with it.
I am assuming you will tidy up the kerning, expecially that l/a combination.
Finally, the small strapline is going to get lost when the logo comes down to a smaller size. I think this small tagline is important because without it your name strikes me as more of a technology than a service provider.
Nice idea.

<div class=commentbody>Wow. That's a big question. I think that the search is one of the big joys of typographic design!
Here's what I suggest. Visit some of the foundries and see what YOU think.
Go to:
Sudtipos
Foundrytypes
Veer
FontShop
MyFonts
Die-Gestalten
etc.
Then, start poking around Typophile and look at the font IDs. There are lots of treasures to be found and the beauty is you get to see them in use. Tip: Search Typophile using Google as opposed to the built-in search function. You'll get more results. Instructions on how to google site specifically lie elsewhere on the site.
Make printouts of all the fonts you like. Put them on the wall. Then, walk away for a few days and see how you feel when you get back.
We expect a full report!

<div class=commentbody>Just another point. Do you really need the 'ltd' in your stapline? As far as I'm aware, at least in New Zealand, you don't need to have the 'ltd' in your branding – it's just part of your trading name. Just having 'mediaplay design' will look much nicer, and you'll avoid readability issues mallbright mentioned when scaled down. If you stick with that composition, you can make 'design' larger, with the extra room and I'd suggest trying setting 'design' in all caps to make it more snug in there and get rid of any awkward spaces you're generating in there with the ascenders of the lower case.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I've been working away, looking through loads of fonts and have come up with a list to go on my wall to look at. The resources here are fantastic, apart from reading elements of typography and general looking at fonts in sample books and books I really haven't had a clue about what fonts to use and how to go about them best. I feel looking through the site I made a little process in visually understanding it all a bit more. I worked out that I wanted to go with a more fluid, open and clean font rather than the constricted one I was looking at. I went with fonts with short accenders and decenders as there are quite a few, and this makes it more neat and compact. It gave it a dial like feel which worked well with the play element. I ended up not liking my previous effort. I thought my efforts were amateurish.

I also really loved foundry context but more for type
http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_context/context.html
Once i've made up my mind, its to the drawing board to work on the logo.
I want to incorporate a play symbol in a circle somewhere as a graphic. My tagline will be something like switched on design or forward thinking
Any thoughts on these fonts above would be gratefully received

<div class=commentbody>There is this other topic in the forum: <a href=http://typophile.com/node/36338>wordmark for visual artist</a>
The designer wrote:
<cite>Key words are, empowerement, luxury, contemporary, approachability and possibly subtly suggest her asian influence (specifically japanese).</cite>
And my reply was:
<cite>Anyway, I think you’re aiming *way* too high — five “keywords” which appear to be contradictory with each other to the common sense. I wouldn’t even know how to unify “empowerment” with “luxury”, or “luxury” with “approachability” — I’d say “luxury” pretty much negates the other two.</cite>
<cite>If anyone actually pulls it off to deliver something that echoes all your five “keywords” to the majority of the audience, I’d call him a grandmaster of design without any hesitance.</cite>
What you're trying to do reminds me strongly of that -- particularly your reaching for "fluid" and "solid" at the same time.

<div class=commentbody>The concern I have with most of the last roughs you posted, is that they look very crammed (like the 2nd from the left in the middle row). As in; there is, in my opinion, too much going on. There are the graphic images, the wordmark, and then you incorporated some of the parts of the images into the wordmark as well. <em>And</em> then there is also the tagline.
I would stick with a wordmark plus the image, and don't put any more doodles around it.
You might find a solution for the tagline, but check if you really need it. You can always put that tagline in another way on your stationary (or whatever you will put it on).</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've been through researching and come up with this design any thoughts on the design colours, kerning layout would be great. My tagline is forward thinking design. One thing i'm worried about is the balance at the top, the thought bubbles come from the I. I've tried it elsewhere, but it didn't make so much sense. Would you drop the thought bubbles or fill them in with colour or have them in a device that balances it all?

<div class=commentbody>I like where you're going in concept 3 -- it has the potential to be a very strong mark. Have you tried playing with adding the missing descender to the triangle somehow? Or putting the triangle inside the counter of the p? Perhaps it needs a different font to make it <em>really</em> work?

I have to say, with the current font, there is simply no way the logo can work for me -- at all. To me, the ugliness of the font will just overshadow everything.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I usually just work with a preview of the font from FontShop or wherever to see how it'll look before actually buying it. It won't be a vector, but it'll give you a good sense of how the design will work.

<div class=commentbody>but you like the font Henry, would that be a positive? ;) I got the feeling no one like the forward thinking idea and that it was confusing to the initial design. Seperate almost to the key of the design. Thanks for the post though! I see if any other comments and maybe go back to the drawing board or to a previous design. I do like this font too, it has a bit more playfulness to it</div>

<div class=commentbody>How about using a version of "m" that doesn't have a "double swing"? That would instantly seperate it from the "Big Mac".
A few examples:

<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/phatphonts/equaliser/>Equaliser</a>
<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/mercado/>Mercado</a>
All those fonts have a lower case "m" without a double swing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>When I mentioned resemblance to the Big Mac, I actually meant the "m" you had there. Obviously I didn't communicate that clearly enough, since you're still keeping it.
Also, the rounded corners of the triangle should be much more visible -- with significantly larger rounding radius.
Now, allow me to suggest the following concept:
1. Create a rectangle with rounded corners -- thick white outline, no fill;
2. Add a vertical stroke in the middle and erase the bottom side -- now you have a "m" which is symmetrical and without double swing;
3. Put a triangle with rounded corners around the "m" -- black fill, one angle pointing downwards;
4. Rotate the whole thing, which should still be left-right-symmetrical until this point, 30 degree clockwise.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Henry thats very kind of you, I see what you mean. Your comments have been great so far. Its a fantastic look but maybe not me. It feels very technical, for another company it would be perfect. But I don't think this is right for me being a very untechnical type of designer, i'm more passion, far out there, enthusiasm (bad spelling) type of designer.
So as far as this route goes i'm better going back to something more like a handwritten font maybe. Thanks for the time you have put in</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The reason I dislike your choices of typefaces is absolutely not that they're "not techi", nor do I think for a second that they represent the opposite of "techi" -- should that be the goal here.
Actually, I don't even consider my own preference for typefaces to be "techi", since I use classical serif fonts whenever possible instead of modern sans. There are plenty of great fonts I love out there which aren't "techi" at all.
The first and foremost impression your fonts -- pretty much all of them -- give me, are:
1. "retro" (or "outdated", if put less complimentary) -- those typefaces are typical for the "disco era";
2. "amateurish" -- not necessarily in the bad sense of the term, but still.
At this time, I think it would be a good idea to re-define the objectives you want to achieve with your logo. Originally you listed nine of them, which were obviously too much. But since then, you haven't made the decision about what to cut and what to keep -- so perhaps they're all still floating in the back of your head and causing constant confusion to some degree?
Think about it and name one or two objectives (it may also be three, if they're things that naturally belong together, like "higher, faster, further"). That should help you clear your mind a lot.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Have you considered using the font <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18&subpage=viewfonts"> Neutraface</a> or <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=94"> Neutra Condensed?</a> I agree with everything Henry said -- and since you're still exploring fonts, why not try a few that aren't "techi" or "retro"? Make your statement more simply - just "professional."

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for your comments. Henry I only making comment to what you had said in the past on this post. Not down to your taste in general, which i'm sure is exceptional and wide. I have looked at neutraface its a lovely font. Certainly more classy than what I have. I'll look at it again thought. I really like the personality of the 70's fonts. These are the key words that I've got down to since my last list.
Approachable
forward moving
versitile
I have to say i'm pretty happy with what I have. I've asked my designer friends and they like it. But who's to say they have taste. However if I can do better I will and I will look at your kind suggestions

<div class=commentbody>Taking a geometric rounded face and adding serifs from Serif Gothic is not a good look, especially when it produces oddly stressed strokes in what are otherwise almost monoline characters. I cannot see how you would apply <em>forward moving</em> or <em>versatile</em> as adjectives to the result.

<div class=commentbody>I hate to jump in at the last moment and say some negative things, especially considering it seems there's been a lot of work going on. But, if I read your desires to be less about new media and more about print (or at least a balance of the two), then your firm name is completely wrong. Similarly, if you want to convey less interactivity, why would you insist on using the 'play' symbol that clearly evokes an interactive nature? I'd give some considerable thought to that before settling on a design. Perhaps this is why you've gone through so many different iterations of the logo and not felt completely at ease with them.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the comments. Changing the name or moving into new media look like the only options with this one. I new it with my original post. Hoped I could make it work</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm really glad you've narrowed down your list of keywords, and I think the list is workable, too. But as others haven suggested, those keywords aren't being carried by your logo design(s) yet.
And I can't agree more with Jon -- I share exactly the same confusions (among others) about what you're trying to do here. To be blunt, I believe there is a gap between what you are (as a designer) and what you want to do (again, as a designer), and you need to deal with this conflict (a certain "split of identity") first before you can proceed.
If that sounds too philosophical to you, here is an example of practical problem: There's a certain conflict between "approachability" (depending on which sense of the word we're looking at) and "new media". On the "approachable" side, the font style you're looking for -- which you call "non-techi" -- is usually called "casual", and that's a major font category, with lots of great fonts to choose. The problem is, the vast majority can't be associated with "new media" in any way, because to a certain degree, "new media" implies "telecommunication" and "mass media", which in turn implies "no direct contact" and "de-personalization", respectively.
The only practical way I see to unify "modernness" and "approachability" is to feature an "approachable" motif (for example, one that can trigger sentimental associations) in a "modern" style. A good example:

But before we discuss that, I’d rather urge you again to clear with yourself what you really want — answer the philosophical questions first, the principal ones second, the conceptual third, and the implementational last.
