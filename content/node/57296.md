  1990 as an unpublished work by Bitstream Inc.  All rights reserved.  Confidential.\u201D\r\n\r\nMy
  question is this: What the heck?\r\n\r\nIt's obviously published. I have it, so
  it must be published. Not only that, but this <em>exact statement</em> is the copyright
  embedded into the [[Bitstream Charter]] that was given to the TEX community with
  an open license. (The [[Bitstream Vera]] copyright and license is much more specific.)\r\n\r\nIs
  this their way of trying to control copyright indefinitely, since under American
  law the creator owns absolute and indefinite rights over any unpublished works?
  If so, they need to look up the definition of \"published\".\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n"

  body: Please note that the <cite>"as an unpublished work by Bitstream"</cite> rubbish
    is only contained in the PS Type 1 versions and not in the TrueType versions of
    the fonts. If the rubbish note had any meaning, then the TTF fonts would be published
    and the PS fonts would be unpublished, but I repeat, the note is rubbish and may
    be ignored.
