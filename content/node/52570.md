  you all our best seasonal wishes.\r\n\r\nI'm in the middle of the design of our
  business cards and would love to receive your feedback.\r\n\r\nSeveral things have
  to be said :\r\neverything (1) & (2) is going to be (black) hot foiled stamped on
  black plike\u2122 paper except for the (fn) sign on the (2) which will be embossed
  (hope I use the right english terminolgy).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the design
  ?\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginie\r\nvirginie@fluonoir.com\r\nwww.fluonoir.com\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ishot-8_6250.jpg]"

  body: "Nice logo and great sense of depth with the dark charcoal/black. I favor
    number 1 as it leaves each side for its own purpose \u2014 I get a little overwhelmed
    by info with number 2. \r\n\r\nI'd love to see/feel this final product, especially
    if it's going to be on plike paper. \r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Thank you for your input, penn :)\r\nWe're having a bit of a second thought
    on the plike paper : if yours hands perfectly (and I mean perfectly) clean, your
    fingers leaves stains on it... And the paper we're gonna use for our business
    cards is also going to the the box that will contain our \"brochure/printed portfolio\".\r\nSo
    what do you think ? Are the stains a big issue or does it just leave some kind
    of \"craftwork\" feeling ?"

  body: "I didn't realize the plike paper would stain so easily . . . If it's bad,
    I'd say go with an alternate that has a similar texture. \r\n\r\nDid anyone touch
    the sample in that picture? It doesn't look too bad there.\r\n\r\nThe business
    card being such a small, focused area would probably show the stains off more
    than a larger piece such as this. In any case, you don't want to appear like a
    greasy company. \r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "At my point of view I think the problem you have to balance those information
    come from the use of the Osf and probably also from the use of too much typeface.
    \r\n\r\n(\xC0 mon point de vue le probl\xE8me d'\xE9quilibre vient de l'utilisation
    des chiffres elz\xE9virs et aussi qu'il y a trop de typo dans cette carte et aussi
    le choix que vous avez fait)"

  body: "Yes, I agree that there are too many different fonts here. I'd also worry
    about legibility with the phone number - keep in mind that small size and low
    contrast are already working against legibility. I can foresee the 8 being mistaken
    for a 6.\r\n\r\nI bet this will look very sharp when printed."

    to figure out, where to put our phone number and which typeface to use.\r\nProblem
    is I designed this b.card without the [damn] phone number [see 1st post] and was
    ok not to have it displayed but my associate insisted on having it.\r\nSo right
    now I'm trying this, do you think it works ? I have to deliver the pdf. to the
    \"gravure\" guys [for the hot foil stamping] this afternoon. Grrr.\r\n\r\nIt's
    driving me nuts.\r\n"

    about them so far.\r\nOur clients and business partners love them too, we've only
    had compliments so far.\r\nA couple of sceptics \"black on black, can I read it
    ?\" but Hey, you got step up for your convictions.\r\nOur creative agency name
    is fluonoir (meaning fluoresecent black in French) so, well, deal with it.\r\nThe
    business card is clearly a strong statement on our side.\r\nI'll post pictures
    of them later on this weekend.\r\n\r\n@eatingcrayons :\r\nwe used the 380 gr.
    because hot foil stamping on both sides on the 270 gr. would have leave marks
    on the other side :)"

  body: "So I ordered and just received samples of both Plike and Curious Skin. And
    my first impressions are the exact opposite of drduckling's.\r\n\r\nSkin feels
    and looks pretty much like a high quality (matte) cotton paper. \r\n\r\nPlike
    though is absolutely amazing. It has a texture of a \"wet silk\" textile or ..
    uhm .. a very fine chamois. It is also <em>extremely</em> matte. For example,
    the burgundy sample showed no visible highlights whatsoever when I looked at it
    from every angle against a light that was 2 feet away. It was really quite something.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    for what it's worth I didn't manage to leave any fingerprints on Plike even though
    I was sweating with excitement :-) Skin though managed to accumulate few dozens
    of white speckles by merely being pulled out of the envelope.\r\n"

    to take more pictures later).\r\nCheers y'all ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_8059_6258.jpg]"
