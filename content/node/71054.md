  body: "I often wonder on questions about fonts like this 'why do you need the exact
    font?' -- there are probably dozens, if not hundreds, of similar hand-printed
    fonts that are free for the taking, and almost no one would ever even wonder if
    it wasn't identical. \r\n\r\nI mean, I have looked for hundreds of posts like
    this, but every now and then I have to ask \"Why?\" It's almost certainly a freebie
    -- you just have to be willing to look at about 1000 of them to try to see the
    same shapes in the letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    exact font. I offer one called <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=fennario&nb_ppp_old=10&page=1&text=enzymes+for+Life&nb_ppp=10&psize=m&classt=alpha\">Fennario</a>
    by DogStar, as a reasonably similar substitute. There were many others I could
    have picked.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "To answer your \"why do you need the exact font\" question:\r\nI have a client
    in Belgium that knows absolutely nothing about graphics or what vector or high
    resolution means. I have to re-create a logo for them because what you see above
    is their \"high resolution\" logo.\r\n\r\nThat's a great substitute though-- thanks
    for the suggestion."

  body: "I hope you can use an equivalent, because finding an exact font of that genre
    is almost pure luck, unless it is a commercial font.\r\n\r\nThanks for responding
    to my question that was blurted in a moment of exasperation. I do often wonder
    about that with so many of these posts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
