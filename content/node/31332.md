  body: "I'm not sure how you define luxury. The engraver I have used for many years
    is Artcraft, in southern Massachusetts. They can order any paper (Crane or otherwise)
    and will do any design with great skill.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.artcraft.com/Index.html\r\n\r\nJust
    don't be in a hurry to get the work. \r\n\r\nNota bene: There is an Artcraft engraving
    company in Florida as well, but I know nothing about them."
