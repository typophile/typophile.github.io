body: "I am having trouble with a PS Type 1 font I built in Fontographer nine or ten
  years ago.\r\n\r\nI was advised to put the Euro glyph in the place of \"currency\"
  symbol (unicode 00A4).\r\n\r\nShift-Option-2 used to bring up my Euro glyph just
  fine. I have old docs with it in use.\r\n\r\nBut today, my CS4 apps insist on substituting
  a Myriad or Arial Euro glyph when I hit Shift-Option-2 instead of the one I built
  for my font.\r\n\r\nI can access my original euro symbol through the glyph pallet
  but it swaps out when I use the key strokes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo I need to re-engineer
  the font? Or is there another key stroke combination that will bring up the proper
  glyph without substitutions?\r\n\r\n"

  body: I've had InDesign do something similar. The type engine in it has a tendency
    to override some things in the font itself, even in OT fonts. My guess is the
    app is trying to sub the Euro via unicode and finding none does a replace. Hopefully
    Miguel or someone will chime in on this one for you.

  body: "Stephen~\r\n\r\nYeah, I kind of figured it was app related.\r\n\r\nHope I
    don't need to re-engineer the font. It was so easy to make Type 1 fonts with Fontographer.
    \r\n\r\nAnd it is so difficult (for me) to make them with FontLab. Too many danged
    variables!!\r\n\r\nBTW-- Love your Raniscript. Look forward to picking that one
    up soon...\r\n\r\nR\\V"

  body: "Unfortunately I don't have enough experience troubleshooting Type 1 fonts
    to be helpful here. (FWIW, the current versions of our font tools are aligned
    with the OpenType format)\r\n\r\nI did however install the Type 1 version of Clarendon,
    and was able to type the Euro sign just fine in InDesign CS4 and TextEdit (OS
    X v10.5.8).\r\n\r\nIf it's not working in your Type 1 font, I think it will either
    be a glyph naming problem, or an encoding problem. (Type 1 fonts don't have a
    'cmap' table, so it can't be an Unicode issue).\r\n\r\nIs the glyph named \"Euro\"?
    (i.e. not \"euro\" or \"currency\")"

  body: "I didn't want to re-engineer the old type one font because it's one in a
    12 part family set.\r\n\r\nBut opening them up in Fontlab, I realized several
    glyphs have bad names and unicode.\r\n\r\nSo I fixed them all and re-imported
    kerning metrics. Now I need to generate the font.\r\n_________\r\n\r\nI know type
    one is supposed to go by the wayside soon --probably-- but I still need to supply
    a type one set to the foundry.\r\n\r\nI never have figured out how to set up the
    suitcases for type one with Fontlab. And it was so easy in Fontographer!\r\n\r\nThe
    default suitcase names are Plain, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic. But my old font
    has:\r\nLight\r\nLight Italic\r\nLight Small Cap\r\nMedium\r\nMedium Italic\r\nMedium
    Small Cap\r\nBold\r\nBold Italic\r\nBold Small Cap\r\nBlack\r\nBlack Inline\r\nBlack

    find the link now.\r\n\r\nAnybody have that link?\r\n\r\nNot that I ever did really
    understand it when I read it last."
