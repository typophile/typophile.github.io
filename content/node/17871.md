    if the letter set is Latin. Make the characters authentic Chinese and its no longer
    a Latin font, but authentic Chinese. But I know what you mean. There are some

    so excuse me for barging in way too late.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a more
    calligraphic, refined look a rather unexpected candidate might be [[Nick Cooke]]'s
    <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=GTT0000006\">Gizmo</a>.
    Using it sparsely in combination with a subdued sans should give a very classy
    result."
