  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,

I trying to learn and understand the meaning of such words as contemporary, modern, industrial when applied to a sans serif typography sense.

I see fonts listed as contemporary and I think clean eligible fonts like Gills Sans, Helvetica, Arial (fonts that you see everyday and that are main stream), but I also see other futuristic / modernistic looking fonts that also list themselves as contempary.

Does anyone have any good links, tutorials or books that I might be able to read to help me understand the finer points of these meanings as I try to improve my knowledge of type.

Any help would be great

		<div class="commentbody">Bringhurst's "The Elements of Typographic Style" is an excellent typographic resource. Unfortunately, as you're probably discovering, there is no concrete set of rules to typographic definitions or their usage. People seem to use what makes sense to them. So its best to carefully explain to others what you mean when you use certain terms that could have various meanings or even usages that vary by context.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">"Contemporary" is a word often used to indicate a style, but taking it literally it means "at the same time as" (and here, an ending "us" is implied). So it seems odd to me to talk about types designed half a century or more ago as contemporary.

		<div class="commentbody">Agree with bemerx25, you'll find some descriptions to be erroneous in some places. There is a tendency to equate contemporary and modern which is inaccurate and big differences between similar descriptions. Futuristic and futurist would be an example of this.

I think Helvetica is classified as a neo-grotesque sans to be really specific about it, but I understand this doesn't really deal with the 'theme' of the type so to speak, rather it's form.

Until you think of fonts that were designed 400 years ago. That leaves Helvetica as contemporary to someone born in 1954, as I was.</div>

You guys you don't know of any other books that also cover how to describe a certain style from a more design point of view? I'm trying to get a better grasp on it all.</div>
