  case can someone brusquely tell me where to find it?) but is it ok by copyright
  to use illustrator to modify individual letterforms for use in, say, a poster? I
  realize that you normally need to get permission before altering the software of
  a font, but I wondered whether this extends to the individual letterforms which
  can be turned into vector data\r\nthanks again, sorry if it's old ground\r\n\r\nNick"

  body: "The main objections to derivative fonts is the dilution of ownership rights
    that such fonts may contribute to. In general I think most type designers and
    foundries would find it acceptable to modify a character or set of characters
    in Illustrator, that's how most logos get made after all. \r\n\r\nThe practice
    is so common I doubt many EULAs even talk about it. But having said that some
    EULAs are tricky and the best advice would be to check. \r\n\r\n "

    throughout the industry; as Simon says it's common enough to do this in corporate
    logoland. Good to hear that you're not settling for some 'off the shelf' approach
    to your poster..."

  body: "Modifying a letterform (or even several letterforms) that has been converted
    to outlines is <strong>not</strong> modifying the font. If anyone has a EULA that
    prohibits this very common practice, he/she/they ought to give some serious consideration
    to changing that EULA to conform to real-world practice.\r\n\r\nAfter following
    several threads in this forum, I changed my EULA to allow modification of my fonts
    for personal/corporate use: as long as the end product is not resold or redistributed,
    the end user ought to have the option of making changes that make the product
    work best for them."

    to users. In fact, several foundries have come round to doing this. Sadly, I don't
    know that it will ever be the norm.\r\n\r\nI like your use of the phrase \"real-world
    practice.\" The PDF is how the \"real-world\" shares files now, and yet many foundries
    still prohibit this in some way.\r\n\r\nNicholas, which foundry's fonts are you
    considering to use in the way you describe?"

  body: "Gee, thanks for all the feedback, I'm thinking of modifying rockwell (my
    options are limited and I think it's a good font for what it is ;) ) by making
    individual letters 3-dimensional using the illustrator effect; (glamourous I know)
    but more generally I would like to modify type by distressing it/adding swashes
    and ligatures and just generally integrating the type more into my designs\r\nthanks
    again"

    some kind of freeware - you can modify the font and sell the results. ;-) Unfortunately
    and unsurprisingly the best EULA terms don't often sync up with the best fonts.\r\n\r\n"
