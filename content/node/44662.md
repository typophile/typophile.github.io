body: "Hi,\r\nwe have some nasty version of two fonts called Veran Est and Veran Turc.
  I'm on a mac and when I 'get info' on the fonts it says copyright Quartet Systems.
  I would like to buy some nice new versions of these fonts as they are proving very
  troublesome, the problem is that I cannot track down the foundry or the font from
  elsewhere. I was wondering if all you experts out there may be able to help out.\r\n\r\nMuch
  appreciated.\r\nSean"

    maybe close) alternatives.

  body: "Thanks Pieter,\r\n\r\nthat was indeed the foundry. I did find that site in
    an earlier search but my schoolboy french was not helping me make sense of the
    site and I could not see any references to fonts. Anyway I contacted them and
    unfortunately they no longer make the fonts and the last versions they made are
    not compatible with CS apps so that explains the problems we've been having. They
    suggested that the Veran fonts were, for all intents and purposes, Futura WGL
    so now I am hunting for Futura WGL but so far there do not seem to be any WGL
    versions of Futura. If anybody has come across foundries making Futura WGL I would
    appreciate a heads-up.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wonder if we should all just use Times
    and Helvetica, my life would be so much simpler.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSean"
