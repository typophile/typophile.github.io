  listening to a lot of electronic-ish music, namely Two Lone Swordsmen, Junior Boys,
  Black Devil Disco Club, Chris Clark, Boards of Canada, Battles etc. I find the repetitious
  nature an excellent fit for kerning, it gets me into a rhythm, almost a trance.
  \r\n\r\nSo the question is, what do you all find good to listen to while kerning?\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

  body: "I can't listen to anything while I work on type or design. It is okay if
    I am doing home maintenance stuff but I get too distracted for even things like
    kerning.  When I listen to music, I really listen or watch. My favorite music
    is opera so it is not so repetitive as pop music. I also like blues and R&B when
    I am driving a distance.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Metal and Rock music mainly, but I'll sample anything. I usually put a film
    on in the background instead of music, I find that relaxes me more.

    I see it is in time with Eric West's animated gif of the cat with the machine
    gun. What's the word for that...something like oxymoronic...incongruent, I guess.

    is not the same. I could just see someone with an advertising background, kerning
    all the notes until they touched each other.\r\n\r\n(Apologies for being silly

    Illustrator work. I find Kraftwerk the perfect accompaniment, a particular favourite
    being Man Machine. It sounds like a well-running electronic machine, and makes
    me feel as if the computer and I are at one. It''s rarely the case in fact, but
    if I feel that way it helps. '

    song for someone actually). I wrote it out in Illustrator (that was really fun).
    When I showed it they didn't like where the words fell and asked me to just move
    a couple of things around. I had to explain that music doesn't work that way -
    you can't put 5 quarter notes in 4/4 time.\r\n\r\nSo I ended up rewritting the
    song a wee bit so we wouldn't look like idiots.\r\n\r\nAnd needless to say I will
    never, ever try that again.\r\n\r\nThat is my tale of \"kerning music\".\r\n\r\npbc"
