body: "Hi there dear Typophiles, \r\n\r\ndoes anyone have a picture or a typespecimen
  of the typeface \xBBRetina\xAB by Hoefler & Frere-Jones and could show it?\r\n\r\nReason
  why: Mario Garcia has redesigned the layout of the \u2013 where I live \u2013 well-known
  quality-newspaper from Austria <a href=\"http://www.salzburg.com/epaper/PHP-Files/archivedpages.php\">\xBBSalzburger
  Nachrichten\xAB</a>. They now use <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/ScotchFB\">Scotch</a>
  from David Berlow as copyfont, the italic-weight as lead-typeface in some books
  and <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?LY\">Frutiger</a> from A. Frutiger
  as headlinetypeface. \r\n\r\nOriginally Mr. Garcia wanted to use \xBBRetina\xAB
  as headline-font, but the people there rejected it and stuck to Frutiger, as used
  the last couple of years. \r\n\r\nHuh, Retina?\r\n\r\nHaven't found much of this
  typeface until now. All the previous links from typophile go to 404-sites to H+FJ.
  Is this Retina-typeface out of business? Could someone show a complete alphabet
  of it? Please?\r\n\r\nWell, thanks for reading. Even more thanks for answering.
  ;^D"

  body: "Hi St\xE9phane, \r\nthank you very much for the site. Must have overlooked
    it. \r\n\r\nIs this the whole family? Do you or anyone else know if there is a
    display weight of it, too? \r\n\r\nIf not, how could anyone want to have all those
    inktraps seen in headlines? Now I know why the people there didn't wanted to change
    their headline-typeface. \r\n\r\nStrange.\r\n\r\nMerci, St\xE9phane, again. "

  body: Retina was designed as part of the "Wall Street Journal" redesign by Mario
    Garcia a few years ago (can't remember the exact date). It was intended for use
    in the stock market listings at a bodysize of 5 pts. So I don't think a display
    weight was even considered.
