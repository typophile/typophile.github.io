body: I was just wondering if one were so inclined, could one have a font made from,
  well, a font? Are there foundries that do this and are there books printed with
  metal and ink where the metal was created directly from digital outlines? That would
  be pretty cool, I think.

    spend? ;-)\r\n\r\nI'm sure all the equipment needed to create matrices based on
    some kind of printed master still exists in museums, and at least a few of the
    craftsmen who knew how use them are still alive. The process would require quite
    a bit of human interaction. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n"

  body: I should mention that "one" is not me, I'm so broke (and without income) right
    now that I skip meals to save money for food. I'm just curious. There are custom
    books, art-type things, etc. printed with metal and I wondered if any of these
    companies have taken the step of casting metal from digital.

  body: "Paul, seems as if Grod wants the metal type to be as close to the digital
    orignal as posible - without any artistic interpretation a traditional punch-cutter
    might insert into the work. Can Jim provide that type of service? Any idea of
    how long it would take him to produce a set* of punches for Verdana for example?
    \r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n*just the lower ascii, no need to do the full WGL4 and
    Vietnamese."

  body: "I've made a lot of magnesium cuts from digitally-set type and art. I once
    had planned on making a full font of digitally-altered Mrs. Eaves; I had straightened
    the italic and was using it for a project, but eventually I only had a portion
    of the font made and never used it as the metal was damaged.\r\n\r\nIf you don't
    mind wood backing - I know this isn't exactly what you had in mind - Valley Graphic
    Arts Engravers in Sacramento are inexpensive and do a great job.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    this isn't casting, but rather engraving - a very different situation. I bet you
    could do this relatively easily with photopolymer with magnetic backing. Talk
    to Gerald Lange, I bet he's experimented with this."

  body: "Si\r\n\r\nI have recently been cutting in metal some designs of mine that
    I had previously done in digital format. One was cut from the digital version
    called Lancelot Light Titling, into metal as Duensing Titling in five sizes. One
    I just sompletd the cutting of is Alexander Quill cut in 14 point and named simply
    Quill in its metal clothing.\r\n\r\nI have cast about a 100 pounds of type from
    the matrices and will very likely have to cast another 100 or so pounds for the
    little book I am doing on my Press and Foundry.\r\n\r\nLast year I cut a 14 point
    metal version of Carl Dair's cartier. I was an absolute slave to Dair's original
    drawings in the various steps in cutting metal, so I think it's a good match.\r\n\r\nThere
    are few individuals out there cutting metal type in both direct matrix, and punch
    form. I can't speak for their accuracy in translating a design from digital to
    lead, if indeed any of them have done that, but I feel that I have gained sufficient
    skill and knowledge from my own experimentation to do so as far as accuracy of
    form and weight is concerned. You should keep in mind that even if a tyope is
    cut spot-on to the original digital font it will look different when printed letterpress
    as opposed to being litho'd.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it would be costly because of
    the great many hours of labour involved in the process, but I found your question
    an interesting one.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, there is a young man her in the Vancouver
    BC area attending ECIAD who is hand-cutting a font of wood type. He came out to
    my workshop to show it to me a couple of months ago. His skill is outstanding.
    I have heard that he is continuing to add to the font.\r\n\r\nJim "

    a linoblock. After a few letters things go quite easily. There is like with everything
    a bit of a learning process, inthis case getting familiar with how the wood cuts
    across the grain etc.\r\n\r\nJim"
