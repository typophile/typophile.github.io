body: "I'm trying to set up some bar codes, these need to be printable as fonts with
  limited pre processing, I've selected a barcode called Code 93 which is quite condensed
  compared to say, Code39 (its predecessor)\r\n\r\nI'm now trying to get/create a
  font for it as it seems to be hard to track down (and I have no budget to fork our
  $100 dollars) I have had some success fixing a broken free font but I'm a bit lost
  at the \"Hinting/Instruction\" aspect.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to print this barcode on
  a 203dpi Thermal transfer label printer, what kind of auto hinting etc do i need
  to do get this to work (From MS word initially and a FoxPro form generator down
  the line)\r\n\r\n[or does anyone have a working free version, the first results
  on google lack start and end characters required]\r\n\r\nThanks,"
