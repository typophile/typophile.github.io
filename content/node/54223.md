  based on a preexisting typeface. It's for a typography course I'm taking. Thanks,

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/radiant_5674.gif]\r\nIt looks like a
    version of Radiant, one of the few sans serifs with that kind of contrast between
    thick and thin strokes. But it's been extended, and further modified (compare
    the G's on the 3 pencils). "

    really a pre-war typeface? Do you know the original foundry?"
