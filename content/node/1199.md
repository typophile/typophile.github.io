body: After Desks, Tatoos, Poisons, I have the feeling that a new thread on favorite
  transports used by typophile can be fun. <BR> <BR>Do you use just your shoes? or
  Bicycle, Car, Buses, Metro, Skateboard, Scooters, Motorbikes, Airplanes or just
  plain feets&#42;? to go there from there? <BR> <BR>&#40;I will follow with mines
  too&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42; this remind me a talk topic from Tobias Frere Jones couple
  years ago for a Fuse conference at SF.

    driving a good car, but over here the traffic and cops take all the fun out of
    it. The buses are unreliable and not cheap, while the metro is just plain ridiculous:
    you have to be rich to afford it, plus you have to drive to get to a station...
    The gas lobby just uses public transport to make people like their cars more.
    <BR> <BR>I get around in my old BMW convertible - falling apart, like me. But
    the best transport -especially in LA with all the traffic and great weather- has
    gotta be a motorcycle - a Japanese screamer. I had a Yamaha 700, it got stolen.

  body: 'Why would you want an SUV in Europe? You can drive as fast as you want in
    Germany, You can go over 90mph regularly without some stupid fat bloke with a
    gun waiting to make some money for the state, and you can break 115mph on the
    long trips. You can have lots more fun in Europe in a old Mini than you could
    ever have in a new SUV in America. I love my old Rover Metro K reg while at uni
    in Reading and it was great buzzing all over south England from Gillingham to
    East Anglia, to Richmond to Bournemouth.. etc. SUV are usually driven by mom&#39;s,
    that&#39;s why they put mirrors on both side now. In the old day trucks if they
    had a mirror under the visor it was on the passengers side not both. And that&#39;s
    a fact jack. And we pay a lot more and drive a lot less. '

  body: Tim nice spotting... No. 3, It&#39;s at the bus stop across from Yates.. where
    the traffic is sent around off Broadway and then back to it in front of the Wimbledon
    train/tube station.. I missed out Wandsworth but the traffic was bad today.. so
    I could only take pics when behind a bus or at the corner of Acre lane and Brixton
    high road. The sepia ones where going another way through Tooting to Clapham..
    today it was the posh way to Womble village to Wandsworth etc.

    <BR> <BR>Sorry Vince, but this kind of remark makes me  <BR>cringe like hell.
    People get killed by speeding.  <BR>Loads of them. Every day. If you do 115mph
    on a  <BR>Belgian highway/motorway &#40;what&#39;s the proper word  <BR>in English?&#41;
    you get you driver license revoked,  <BR>immediately, and rightly so. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    got two little kids, and I want them to bury me,  <BR>like it&#39;s supposed to
    be, not the other way around.

    a few weeks ago a mother and her little child were forced off the autobahn by
    a daimler-chrysler test driver racing with another test driver. mother an child
    died. <BR>having no speed limit on german highways is one reason i traded in my
    fast saab for the safest car i could afford for my wife and my son.

    I prefer, and I use it most days, either to get from A to B, or for exercise.
    The picture was taken in 1995 and the bike appears to have aged less than me.  <BR><img
