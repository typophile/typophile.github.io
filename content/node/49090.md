  \ the default font i had, and the design of the web is pretty mediocre.\r\n\r\nSo

  - People who are interesten in graphics,open source graphics,video tutorials on
  computer graphics or electronic music, VJ'ing , and sotwarelike : \r\n\r\n                             processing,blender,inkscape,ableton
  live etc... \r\n\r\n---Message - I want it to look Serious, stylish ,classy, new
  but not digital , young and \"cool\" .  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Media -  Web and print

  body: "thanx man, but i find that type ugly , i want something \"cool\" i know some
    of you will say im a noob but i like Helvetica,futura extra bold, avant garde
    ...\r\n\r\nI want something more stylish, but i guess the ones i just said are
    too overused right ?"

  body: "thank you so much for the reply but thats just not what im looking for ,
    i want something in between helvetica, futura or avant garde , something that
    you just type text in and looks good, new, clear, with character .\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    think i should just try lots of fonts ,i will look at the top 10's and  stuff
    like that , where could i look for cool  design fonts ?\r\n\r\nnot a shop please
    , there are thousands , a blog or something that list the coolest fonts of the
    2000's  ?"
