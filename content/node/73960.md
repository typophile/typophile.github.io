    like that.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avant_4359.png]"

  body: "Because of the R. \r\n\r\nEvery other Avant Garde that I'm familiar with
    has an R with an open counter. Here is ITC Avant Garde in a similar weight --
    look closely at the R.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/your_4497.png]"

  body: Well I've learned something -- the only version that doesn't have a closed
    R is the one on my computer! I should get out more often...

  body: "Doh! That's why I couldn't find it on my system. I had the MM version installed,
    just loaded up ITC Avant Garde Gothic, hit Bold and Bazinga, there she is.\r\n\r\nThanks
    fellas, lets just hope the client goes for it.\r\n\r\nDean.\r\n\r\n(I have to
    confess that it's the quirky R that I like abour it. Does that make me a bad person?)"
