body: Hey, I was watching 'nosferatu' ( the original ), if you are unfamiliar, it
  is a silent film from Germany in 1922. I've seen it a few times, but as one of the
  cue cards came up, I noticed this character, I wondered if anyone knew what it was.
  Any relation to a pre-60's interobang?  It was positioned at the end of a sentence.
