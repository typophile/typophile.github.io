body: "Around the beginning of 1997\u2014just after the game \"Wipeout 2097\" was
  released for the original PlayStation\u2014I got hold of  copy of Fontographer for
  Windows and created my first font. It was heavily based on one of fonts used in
  the game, but it was created out of nothing, by my own hands. It was a labour of
  love - I called it: <em>Block Out</em>.\r\n\r\nI put it on my first website that
  I'd created as part of my degree at Liverpool University, along with some software
  I was distributing under the shareware concept, and watched as the file was downloaded
  hundreds of times. I removed the letter \"P\" (a reference to UK TV quiz show \"Blockbuster\")
  and offered the full typeface in return for a shareware fee.\r\n\r\nA few weeks
  later I received a letter from Ian Anderson of The Designers Republic asking for
  me to remove the font from my website, send them the source files and any money
  I had made from selling font. They claimed that the font was identical to their
  6x6 font, even though my font is clearly created on a 7x7 pixel grid. I still have
  the letter somewhere in my files.\r\n\r\nI guess Ian Anderson didn't have that much
  of a grip of technology, so I took great pleasure in letting him know that shareware
  was fundamentally floored as it relied on the honour system - nobody had paid for
  a full copy of the typeface. Also, even if I took the down it was already to late
  - it was in the wild. Excellent.\r\n\r\nAs it goes, I never heard back from Ian
  or his lawyers but the font lives on in the age of the internet! My original version
  can be found at <a href=\"http://www.grsites.com/archive/fonts/view/661/\">grsites</a>
  and a modified (also corrupt?) version can be found at dafont.\r\n\r\nMatt Sephton\r\n2009-09-15\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/block-out_5844.png]"
