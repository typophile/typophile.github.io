    will go to waste.

  body: That's what I've been wondering too. After the election what happens? Business
    as usual - or will improving design be a pillar of his presidency?

    said...the Obama Posters you see are something interesting. Marketing material
    in the form of art that might actually be retained after the event."

    wining, unless something major happens that turns the tide. Ok, enough of politics.
    \r\n\r\nRegarding the logos, Obama will certainly run for a second term, thus
    all of the branding can be recycled, or updated.\r\n\r\nJon. \r\n"

    that of the implementation and production.\r\n\r\nAnyone know how much graphics
    for a plane cost?! We are talking about the guy who <cite>declined</cite> $80M
    of public electoral funding in favor of raising his own capital - an estimated
    $200M!\r\n\r\nKinda puts even the most exorbitant design fees in the shade."

  body: Does anyone else think Gotham is getting overexposed? It seems like it has
    quickly become SafeSans, The All-Purpose, All-Pleasing Font.

  body: "It probably is getting overexposed, which will be a shame with there is a
    resultant backlash. I was going to compare it to Auto and Bello from Underware,
    which went through a very visible rise and fall over the last couple of years.
    \r\n\r\nThis probably isn't accurate though, as Gotham is certainly more timeless
    and less stylish than Underware's faces were."
