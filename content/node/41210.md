body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nI' have develop for years a cataloge with nothing else than
  Helvetica. Normal, bold, heavy, thin, etc...\r\nOne of the reasons for this is that
  each page have a \"block\" of text with the name of the article in Helvetica bold
  in English and them several others in Helvetica thin. This \"block\" layout is the
  same as the packing material.\r\nI need to keep the same \"block\" of text as it
  is, but I want to change the rest of the typefaces in the page.\r\nSo...\r\nI need
  a typeface family (bold, heavy, thin, regular, etc).\r\nModern, elegant, clean (its
  a medical devices company) preferably sans, but it could be a serif...\r\nSuggestions
  please!\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio Fonseca\r\n\r\n"
