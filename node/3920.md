  any font program available for OSX yet? I have heard Fontographer &#40;which I own
  for PC&#41; does not work on the OSX platform.  <BR>I&#39;m not really afraid of
  changing programs though, so any suggestions would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks '

  body: ' well, you have the option of running OS classic on the imac, where you can
    run fontographer. when in osx, and you are attempting to run a classic app, it
    will switch you over to classic mode where you can use the program. '

    Hrant, it&#39;s sad that it is only 1024x768... I&#39;m used to running a 21&#34;
    screen @ 1800x1440. '

  body: ' well, as soon as i installed it, i reverted back to os9. practically no
    apps are osX ready yet. just note that you have the option or running either with
    the imac. <BR> <BR>yeah the resolution bit blows. a friend of mine just bought
    one, and that was the only disappointment. <BR> <BR>for what your paying, i think
    it is totally a worth   while purchase. '

  body: Using OS X &#40;pronounced &#34;OS ten&#34;&#41; for the first  <BR>time is
    like learning to drive stick-shift. It&#39;s awkward <BR>the for a while but definitely
    provides a much better  <BR>driving experience. <BR> <BR>It is true that you can
    seamlessly use OS 9 apps  <BR>in &#34;Classic&#34; mode while running OS X. To
    date I  <BR>haven&#39;t had problems with this. &#40;Except for  <BR>synching
    my Palm which I think is a hardware  <BR>problem.&#41;

  body: ' Both FontLab and Fontographer work perfectly happily using Classic under
    MacOS X, though you will need to use the Non-FPU version of Fontographer, apparently.
    I wouldn&#39;t hold your breath waiting for Macromedia to produce a MacOS X native
    version though <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> '
