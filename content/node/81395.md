body: I recently identified a face I found in a book as EF Medieva. I also found very
  similar designs in GoudyMedieval and Milwich. Does this <em>style</em> of type have
  a name? What is its history?

  body: Providing samples of the typefaces in question would be considerate, and more
    likely to garner a response.

  body: The lower case is closer to rotunda than other blackletter styles. The upper
    case are versals. Lombardic would be ok but there might be another Italian or
    Spanish name that is better.

  body: "So, would you say there isn't a true antecedent? Maybe this design is a pastiche
    of several historical styles?\r\n\r\nTo me, it evokes a high-medieval feel, but
    that may be based on contemporary usage and not real historical usage."
