  body: You also might want to do a search at MyFonts.com for "1950s" or "retro";
    some of the professional fonts there are available at a fairly low cost.

  body: "\"some obvious ones\", \"a lot of crap\"\r\n\r\nWhat's obvious to me wouldn't
    be what's obvious to you! It all depends on the use to which the font will be
    put, the nature of the \"packaging\" and its contents, and of course personal
    tastes.\r\n\r\nYou also didn't say whether this was to be used as a large attention-getting
    logo/display or for small text details such as the ingredients list on a food
    product.\r\n\r\nDo you need fonts that include accented characters, or support
    for any languages other than English? Do you need variants such as bold, italic,
    small caps, outlines, etc. ?  \r\n\r\nI won't dare go into a discussion of \"crap\"!
    As they say, one person's crap is another's pot of gold.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
