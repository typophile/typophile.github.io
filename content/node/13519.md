  Westmoreland, United Kingdom, 1958.\r\n\r\nAfter studying to be a Catholic priest
  for three years at Ushaw College, Durham, turned to graphic design and graduated
  from St. Martin\u2019s School of Art in 1985 and the Royal College of Art in 1987.
  Freelance graphic designer since 1987 undertaking anything from humble print work
  for small publishers and arts organisations to typographic sequences for TV commercials.
  Work characterised by careful use of typographic structure, sometimes organic, sometimes
  highly \u2018engineered\u2019, but always deriving from a respect for the material.
  Since 1995 has been assisted part-time by several ex-students enabling larger commissions
  to be undertaken, e.g. Phaidon\u2019s Art & Ideas series implementation (7 titles
  designed in the last 2 years).\r\n\r\nIn addition to practice, has been a frequent
  writer for [[Eye]] and other design magazines and contributor at design conferences,
  and has spoken at colleges throughout England as well as abroad. In September 1991
  became a Senior Lecturer (half f/t) in typography at Central Saint Martins College
  of Art & Design, London. Part of his teaching responsibility is jointly curating
  the Central Lettering Record with [[Catherine Dixon]]."
