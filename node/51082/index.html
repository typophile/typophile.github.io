Also, I read somewhere that Studley is a font that was used. Does anyone know where I can download this, or if it is even available digitally?

I greatly appreciate any help you can give me.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your input, although I suppose I should have mentioned that I've already found P22 Il Futurismo, and that I'm looking for more of a body text typeface.

I'm really hoping to find something that somehow is an integral part of the Futurism period. (Il Futurismo is of course, but is more of a display type, rather than a body text type.)

Also, Futura is more of a Bauhaus and Constructivism typeface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think there really is a typical futurist (body) typeface. From what I've seen (so far) they used typefaces that were at hand (like Bauhaus or Art Deco or plain) and played with composition.

But I'm not an expert on the matter. I didn't mean to state things you already know, I was just intriged by your question. It's an interesting movement.

Have you seen this book already?:

If you don't purchase it, I might ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Don't worry about it. =) How could you know what I do and do not know. ;)

With my findings I have come to realize this too; that there is no specific font. I was hoping someone else could tell me different, but it seems everyone I ask comes to the same conclusion.

That book has come up in my searches, but I am unable to purchase anything at this time.

Thanks very much for your help.</div>
