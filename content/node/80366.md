  the font used in the logo of the Japanese company \"Fuji\" that manufactures rod
  components. \r\n\r\nI tried in vain to locate the site of the company in order to
  get a high - resolution image of the logo - all i could find are major and minor
  distributors, who all seem to use low resolution pictures. \r\n\r\nI tried various
  solutions in order to positively identify the font, such as the [[http://www.identifont.com/identify.html|Identifont]],
  or another one -whose name eludes me at the moment- that attempts to identify the
  font via optical recognition; it seems that specialist interception is inevitable...
  \r\n\r\nIn the following link, you can see the aforementioned logo. \r\nUnfortunately,
  i don't have any more characters at my disposal, other than the 4 compromising the
  company's name. \r\n\r\nhttp://armbreakercustomrods.com/images/Fuji_logo.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate any help in identifying the font.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!\r\n\r\nGod
  speed, \r\n\r\nJohn.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I see no reason to conclude that it's anything other than custom lettering,
    i.e., not a specific typeface...

  body: "I also thought it was custom lettering, but i thought i should give it a
    go with the eyes of experts.\r\n\r\nOh well, i'll keep watching the post and resort
    to drawing if nothing pops up soon. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your answer. "
