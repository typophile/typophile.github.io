    is what Ole Sch\xE4fer and myself made out of the Glasgow 99 typeface which was
    exclusive to Glasgow but not used for a permanent identity, just for the events
    around 1999, when Glasgow was UK City of Architecture and Design. Check this on

    use of the [[http://design.seoul.go.kr/dscontent/designseoul.php?MenuID=490&pgID=237|Seoul
    typefaces]], the semi-serif Seoul Han-gang and the sans Seoul Namsan.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a street sign in Seoul Namsan:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Namsan-sample_3967.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's
    a display in the metro in Seoul Han-gang (sorry it's out of focus):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/han-gang-sample_4213.jpg]\r\n\r\nElsewhere
    in Korea, the cities of Busan and Gimje have their own typefaces as does the province
    of Jeollabuk-do, though I cannot comment on whether they are in active use. But
    my favourite may be for the island province of Jeju-do, whose [[http://www.jeju.go.kr/contents/index.php?mid=010212|Jeju
    typefaces]] include a serif, sans, and a funky display variant. These all support
    special characters needed for writing the Jeju dialect, which uses a vowel letter
    \u318D that is obsolete in Modern Korean."

  body: "The foundry [[http://www.yoonfont.co.kr/|YoonDesign]] is credited with the
    Seoul typefaces. After some digging, it looks like YoonDesign president Pyun Seokhoon
    \uD3B8\uC11D\uD6C8 was the general director of the Seoul typefaces project and
    Park Yoonjeong \uBC15\uC724\uC815 the senior designer. Korean digital typefaces
    are invariably collaborative efforts, and a whole team would have worked on the
    design of the typefaces. It is for that reason that individual designers are rarely
    credited and information about the designers behind typefaces can be difficult
    to find."

    E-Type]], the Latin component of the [[http://www.sandoll.co.kr//IR/project/road.asp|Hangil
    typeface]] designed for road signs in Korea. Hangil of course includes Korean
    alphabet glyphs; Hong-Ik University and the foundry Sandoll were involved in the
    design. I didn't include this because it's not a city/territory thing.\r\n\r\nYou
    can't really find Hangil in use in Seoul because the new signs use the Seoul typefaces.
    I had to go outside the city limits to Gyeonggi-do Province to see Hangil in use."
