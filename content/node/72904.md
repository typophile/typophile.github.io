  in the header on: [[http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/]] and the rest of the
  fantasy sports sites.\r\n\r\nI've been through hundreds of fonts on fontshop.com
  and the WhatTheFont utility on MyFonts.com and still no luck."

  body: "I used the Serif Guide and also searched several sites, including Dafont.
    I could not find an exact match, which leads me to think this is  custom designed/modified,
    or else something off the radar (amateur work, or very small foundry).\r\n\r\nThe
    most similar commercial fonts I could find were Font Bureau's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/dispatch/\">Dispatch</a>,
    or Linotype's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/siseriff/\">Siseriff</a>.
    Only Dispatch has the squarish counters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
