  searching for good sample applications for the PMN Caecilia, when I saw the Warner
  Bros. Logo.\r\nThe text \"Warner Bros. Picture\" really looks like it, but i saw
  that they use this font since the 1980s. PMN Caecilia was released in 1990...\r\nAnd
  my second thought: the letters are not as broad as the Caecilia. But the letters
  have the same design.\r\nSo I'm a bit confused. Maybe you can help me? Does anyone
  know which font Warner Bros. use?\r\nthx"
