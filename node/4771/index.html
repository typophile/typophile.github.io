  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I need some help, I'm lost&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm doing a new logo for a classic car spare parts company - Canley (or Canley Classics - yet to be decided) - also does servicing and work on cars too. They're alot more than just that though - they invest a lot of money in my favourite marque of car (Triumph) - developing various products and making new parts. There is a really big feel good factor about buying from them - they are one of the few good guys - everywhere seems rather money grabbing. Passionate is the word. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A few of their competitors logos: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The trouble I've got is that I the people who are going to appreciate the logo perhaps arent exactly type or design orientated - which I know is normal for most jobs - but Im having a real problem trying to &quot;place&quot; the logo and being happy with it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I almost need to walk away from this job and come back - but I don't have time. I need some fresh thinking. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've been looking at typefaces - and with lots I think &quot;that would look really nice and would give the right feel&quot; - but I then get paranoid thinking that the type isnt going to be suitable - but whats suitable anyway? There are no set rules with what Im working with - and I don't have much to compare with in their market place - as most of them either arent really &quot;designed&quot; or are just really after thoughts&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ramble over&hellip; confused&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I thought this would be fun - working with something I love - but perhaps Im just too close to it&hellip; strange&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->How do you guys cope with this?

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The trouble I've got is that I the people who are going to appreciate the logo perhaps arent exactly type or design orientated<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But these are the people you must reach! They may not be type oriented, but they are certainly Triumph oriented, yes? The trouble (opportunity) with the competion is that as far as I can tell their look does not connect with Triumph in any way. Before thinking about typeface, think about how you can make your product the *authentic* spirit of the original, not the flashy tripple gradient Rimmer Bros. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Make the connection your goal. For example, I bet if you included a very (i mean very) subtle leaf cluster motif, a true enthusiast would instantly recognize it. That's probably not the answer, but seek out that swap-meet junkie appeal. Flip though old brochures, catalogues, ads, car club newsletters, racing ephemera etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for font, don't let this drive your concept. It may be a type-only solution in the end, but is it based on the chrome lettering from the 1956&hellip;. blah blah. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the advice Randy. Feel a bit silly now&hellip; the trouble is the people Im trying to reach I know too well (does that make sense?) and I'm one of them&hellip; so what seems easy is actually a bit difficult&hellip; am I making sense? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Im trying to get it as authentic - and thats what I've been looking at - mainly 60s/70s typefaces - old logos of that period. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have two things to do: a logo for them - which I think will be mainly type based - and also a &quot;competition logo&quot; which will be for their &quot;go-faster&quot; race products they do - and will be cast on to products - and also be on the racing cars they sponsor&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(a very rough!) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Currently working around the original Triumph logo - and making it look a bit more up to date and motorsport-alike&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The original design: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://web.brandsoftheworld.com/?id=112&amp;amp;query_id=5479176&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;brand_id=3449">http://web.brandsoftheworld.com/?id=112&amp;amp;query_id=5479176&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;brand_id=3449</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;is actually based on a pair of wings&hellip; so thats what Im working on&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->James <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
