  that aren't probably very original in themselves. i've been sketching with a broad
  pen and looking at Quadraat's italic, trying to arrive at some crude approximation
  of a garalde face. i thought i'd ask your opinion if there's any novelty in this
  try. all comments welcome!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/obduracy_3559.png]"

    to check a font does not work at such an early stage. you'd be better off checking
    all combinations, or at least all combinations with lead characters (typically:
    o, n, i)\r\nThird: it already looks better on your small size than on your large
    size because of the harsh transitions in curve but is this what you want?\r\n\r\nDrop
    the pen and think indeed. The pen is only a start, mostly to find the ductus,
    IMVHO."

    about some caps and a decision on just how calligraphic \r\nthe face is going
    to be.\r\n\r\nThe broad nibbed pen remains a great way to generate ideas.\r\nEven
    when you have a final character that looks off\r\nask yourself how a pen would
    form it."

  body: "Yes, 95% of type people will do that, some to a greater degree\r\nthan others.
    People tend to repeat what they've been taught.\r\n\r\nMy own thoughts have led
    to what I presented at the Mexico City\r\nconference in October: that not only
    the pen and cartesian grid are\r\nartificial constraints on type design, but the
    even the fundamental\r\nidea that letters are \"fattened\" skeletons prevents
    us from properly\r\nserving the reader.\r\n\r\nTo me the design expressed here
    is best rendered as faux type,\r\nnot a font. In that medium it would look quite
    charming I think.\r\nSome recent discussion here: http://typophile.com/node/64369\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    look at because of its calligraphic construction. "

  body: "In fact it's arguably the prime example of reliance on the broad-nib pen,
    since Rogers physically traced over photographic enlargements of original Jenson
    prints to arrive at Centaur's forms; of course he was thereby necessarily assuming
    a certain design philosophy on the part of Jenson.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I remember reading about the genesis of Centaur and how Rogers wanted \r\nto
    capture the spirit of Jenson's type. So rather then use a printed \r\nexample
    with its distortions due to ink squash etc he drew over bleached \r\nout photographic
    enlargements.I think it's very successful.\r\n\r\nBut another type which has it
    origins in those times and was drawn by\r\nMonotype to be a facsimile of an Aldine
    type is Poliphilus. This was meant\r\nto recreate the appearance of a 15th century
    printed page.\r\nIn text sizes it works very well nice and dark much more character\r\nthan
    Bembo for example.\r\n\r\nWouldn't be brilliant if any drawings or sketches which
    punchcutters\r\nused in those times remained. Of course it may be they didn't
    use\r\nsketches just had perhaps a calligraphic page as a guide.\r\nI've strayed
    sorry can Juhani tell us whats happening with his type?\r\n "

    to \"read\" them!\r\nEspecially in the case where the type designer and the\r\npunchcutter
    were not the same person, the latter would\r\nbe a \"silent modifier\", greatly
    affecting the results.\r\n\r\nAnd in many (most?) cases where the designer and

  body: "thanks for the comments & sorry for my late response. the typeface hasn't
    gone much further yet. \r\n\r\nmy main concern is how the type works in text size.
    i was hoping the pen characteristics, like abrupt transitions & asymmetric serifs,
    would come through as more than just calligraphy reference. i think these features
    are less eye-catching in smaller size and contribute to the overall feel & rhythm
    of the text. the contrasts of form are more important than their tool origin.
    i'm not saying the features of the pen are an improvement to general readability,
    but they don't appear to me as a hindrance either. i admit they're a bore if they
    only raise associations of arts & crafts. \r\n\r\ni think i've broken the constraints
    of the pen more than once, though. the flatted counter forms in some of the letters
    (f, s & t esp.) don't have much to do with the broad pen in my view. i just thought
    there's a slight visual resemblance (round outer curve vs. flat counter) to the
    pen 'fractures' that would hold the type together somehow. also it seemed like
    something that a smaller size would allow to do: short counter curves look almost
    superfluous in body text. \r\n"
