  body: "_Travel On A Dream_ seems to have mini serifs. If you want to try and modify
    Avant Garde Gothic, you might look at a well made mini serif font. I like Gert
    Wiescher's new font Dylan-Copperplate Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/DylanCopperplateBoldInUseSM_6636.jpg]

  body: "Or you could skip the work and follow Dick's suggestion of Serif Gothic Bold.
    \r\nYour image is a cameo or negative, light letters on a dark background. Letters
    in this form can look optically identical to a lighter weight. Nice explanation
    in the book on Frutiger's life [img:sites/default/files/old-images/FrutigerTypefacesP333DAvenir_3938.jpg]\r\nBut
    your negative letters look heavier than Serif Gothic Bold.\r\nI conclude from
    this that your letters are a further emboldened version of Serif Gothic Bold.
    Or are a modified version of Serif Gothic Heavy.\r\nDon"
