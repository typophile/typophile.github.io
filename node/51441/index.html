I&rsquo;m doing a little work for a local &lsquo;zine&rsquo; thats going to review the local music scene, it&rsquo;s called F4 and I&rsquo;m designing the logo.  Here I have a couple examples, I&rsquo;m using MUSEO and I want to ask you guys about some legibility. I was concerned that the &lsquo;4&rsquo; form would not be recognizable in sketch (a) so I broke the stroke of the 4 at the top in sketch (b). How do you feel about the legibility of sketch a and the odd broken 4 of sketch b?</p>
<p>please excuse the rough edges of these sketches.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">So I see the F4 and the Apple &ldquo;Command&rdquo; shape, I think b is better of the two, but needs more refinement - there&rsquo;s weird angles happening that make it disconcerting, things not lining up parallel as expected. I&rsquo;m curious as to what your thinking is behind making the rounded squares different sizes? It kind of unbalances things to my eye. Maybe drop the lower right rounded square to make the number 4 more apparent. I think this is a good concept overall though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>CJ- Really appreciate your re-working there, but the loops are supposed to flow into each other and I&rsquo;d really like to keep the form unbroken.  I think what makes my &lsquo;F&rsquo; form not an &lsquo;E&rsquo; is the position of the horizontal stroke in the middle of the form.</p>
<p>BEM- Hah the &lsquo;command&rsquo; shape! I definitely didn&rsquo;t intend that one (though don&rsquo;t mind it). I made the bottom right square that larger size because I just went off the shape that was given by the bottom right strokes of the &lsquo;4&rsquo; I definitely think what&rsquo;s making this unbalanced is the lower right square, I think I&rsquo;ll either cut it out all together or make it the same size as the other squares.</p>

<p>Sketch A: The bottom right loop is removed without the strokes of the 4 being modified.</p>
<p>Sketch B: The bottom right loop is removed and the bottom vertical stroke of the 4 is shortened to reflect the adjacent horizontal stroke.</p>
<p>Sketch C: The bottom right loop is reduced in size to reflect the other loops.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Scott, first off I like the icon overall in terms of how it looks, BUT, if you ask for a critique on a typophile one of the main issues will always be legibility. The logo you&rsquo;ve designed doesn&rsquo;t read &ldquo;F4.&rdquo; if that&rsquo;s not a concern to you I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to get much positive feedback from this group. If you&rsquo;re pleased with it go with it! Personally I would encourage you to develop your idea into a form where &ldquo;F4&rdquo; is more legible.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks Chris, first off, I&rsquo;m all down for a critique here and I&rsquo;m absolutely open to anyone&rsquo;s opinion here, but it&rsquo;s more the tone of a previous comment that irked me for a second.</p>
<p>Legibility is a secondary concern to me, this symbol will (hopefully) be seen repeatedly so many times that it will actually become more of a ⌘ or something like that where every time one would see it, they don&rsquo;t think &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the letter F and the number 4&rsquo; they just say, oh thats the F4 zine logo, and if they really actually take a moment to look at the symbol they see the two forms.</p>
<p>NOW! legibility aside, what do you guys think about the three sketches in the post above?
Bottom right loop on or off?
if off, which seems better balanced? the full vertical bottom stroke of the 4 or the shortened stroke?
I&rsquo;m considering rotating the lockup very slightly to the left to keep it fresh.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry scott. Ratbaggy made a very sensible comment. I don&rsquo;t know why you felt offended in the first place. Sorry but your logo isn&rsquo;t legible at all. You have to read this thread to know it&rsquo;s supposed to say F4. If you don&rsquo;t believe us, just print it out and hand it over to strangers. Young or old, majority WON&rsquo;T read it as F4. And if you wan&rsquo;t them to refer to the magazine as F4 magazine, they will have to read it somewhere it&rsquo;s an F4 magazine. Otherwise it&rsquo;ll just be some symbol magazine. Do you intend to use words &ldquo;F4 magazine&rdquo; in the headline as well?</p>
<p>So I guess his comment is legit. If you need your magazine head to actually read F4, than you&rsquo;re on a completely wrong track. If legibility is not important at all (but originality is) than this is the logo to go.</p>
<p>Any comment is welcome, even though you may see it as negative. You will have to judge whether you take some advice or not. No need to label people here as &ldquo;as**oles&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>And one more observation: I&rsquo;ve seen the lines in the last batch are not straight. Maybe that&rsquo;s an error. And they also vary from logo to logo.</p>
<p>And to make it look more like mac&rsquo;s command symbol maybe don&rsquo;t put the top stroke of &ldquo;F&rdquo; into two levels. Just keep it straight and go into the top right loop. If you intend to keep the two levels, then make the change a bit more to the right, because it interferes with the &ldquo;F&rdquo;.</p>

<p>now, as I stated earlier. I don&rsquo;t need the symbol to spell out the exact title of the zine, and I am NOT trying to make it look like the command symbol. The guys who are running the thing like how it&rsquo;s going. Anyone, is there anything else that is glaringly wrong other than the legibility issues before I work this out into a more polished image?</p>

I think your 4 would then become more noticeable. Or perhaps think about changing the color values so the F and 4 would remain black while the connecting &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; would be a dark gray. Bonus if you can get the color values to blend nicely into each other.  Just some thoughts to help the F and 4 stand out a bit more while maintaining your &ldquo;connected&rdquo; concept.</div>

I definitely picked up on the Apple &ldquo;Command&rdquo; symbol that some others have mentioned, but that could be because I work at a Mac all day.</p>
<p>The other meaning I could derive from the sketches, the one I think you were going for, is a sort of futuristic (not futurist), slick, electronic attitude. If that is your aim I think you&rsquo;re on the right track, and you could intensify that message by drawing the next round of sketches on an even more restrictive grid.</p>
<p>I think you could try looking deeper into the meaning you&rsquo;re trying to convey, too. Musically speaking, &ldquo;F4&rdquo; is the note F just above middle C, although why that has significance to the zine is beyond me.</p>

There is no consensus that this is not working, I stated before that the people who are running the exquisitely named zine like the look of this. The sketches are working on the level of it looking cool. A trendy music zine doesn&rsquo;t need a treble clef or some deep meaning that&rsquo;s going to be largely lost on anyone but designers. As you said before, this being for a younger audience doesn&rsquo;t even need to be legible. sketches coming soon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So if we&rsquo;re moving past the legible/not-legible debate&hellip; There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it only abstractly representing an F4 - however in that case I would start to consider the over all symmetry and consideration of every single detail in the mark. (and let me try to cut off any misunderstanding by saying that these are not intended as rhetorical or patronizing questions - I&rsquo;m honestly asking&hellip;)</p>
<p>Looking at the last A,B,C samples; A and B have top-right and bottom-left loops that are almost the same, but they&rsquo;re not. On C the bottom-right loop doesn&rsquo;t match either of the two loops. Is this intentional? Do you intend to clean that up later?</p>
<p>In A the bottom-right-corner line pointing down doesn&rsquo;t quite reach as low as the bottom-left loop and the right-pointing line doesn&rsquo;t reach quite as far to the right as the top-right loop. Is there a reason for that?</p>
<p>If this is truly an abstract shape, I&rsquo;d consider making it highly-symmetric (top right/bottom left; top left/bottom right corners identical), then the only places that you  break that symmetry (the bar of the &lsquo;F&rsquo; and the top of the &lsquo;4&rsquo;) will seem much more intentional.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Been following this thread for a little while - I really love these crit threads, although I rarely have much to add!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just been looking at the mark (both the originals and the later suggestions) and my personal feeling is that it would be considerably improved by losing the outer &lsquo;flourishes&rsquo; altogether. I did a little mockup (which incidentally I hate doing - feels wrong changing somebody else&rsquo;s work) based on the suggestion istariskoda put up a few posts ago:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/f4_5144.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>For one thing, I think this improves the legibility of the mark a fair amount. It also leaves it much more compact, which I always think is helpful for a logo - obviously it will mainly be used on the cover, but you never know what other contexts it&rsquo;ll end up being used in! I also think paring it down like this might be helpful from a &lsquo;hip, cool&rsquo; point of view (saying that makes me feel much older than I am) - I think it feels a bit fresher with straight edges and overtones of emoticons/faux-asian characters.</p>
<p>Finally, it&rsquo;ll stop everyone referencing the apple command key! Which can only be a good thing :)</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s just an idea. For the record, I really like the idea, and think you&rsquo;re onto something - but it&rsquo;s not there yet. I sort of think the idea itself is the square with the two protrusions - the flourishes are simply decoration.</p>
<p>Good work with this one, can&rsquo;t wait to see how it turns out. Keep us informed!</p>

<p>now:
cabbage: the loops being matching- no, not intentional, these are just little sketches I was working on and will be cleaned up later.  &lsquo;pointing out&rsquo; strokes not matching up on 11/9 A- those strokes are unedited Museo strokes and yes, in more refined versions, they&rsquo;ll be a bit more thought out in terms of alignment. symmetry- I agree, highly symmetric sounds like a good policy here.</p>
<p>Kristen Navin:
<img src="/images/old-images/one_3439.png" alt=""></p>
<p>istariskoda: yeah those are just in some sketches that I threw together and will be fixed in the final. and thanks for the great painted sketch!  I really like the angle at the top of the stroke of the four there.</p>
<p>dogg: thanks for the sketch, kinda scary tho.. pointy!</p>
<p>Robert: eurostile.. hmm
<img src="/images/old-images/two_5196.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Andi: great sketch - you&rsquo;re right that does improve the legibility.</p>
<p>Robert agian: See, I do not personally believe that Andi&rsquo;s sketch, as great as it is, is better for this specific project. Seeing that the music scene here isn&rsquo;t a european techno kind of thing, it just doesn&rsquo;t work for Ohio.</p>
<p>round 3 sketches coming this evening</p>
<p>thanks again</p>

<p>I like that logo. I mean with just coming up with it, it&rsquo;s pretty good. It might not read right away as F4, but as soon as I get the relation once, I see it without any effort. This is great for the music scene. It&rsquo;s almost like an &ldquo;in&rdquo;.</p>
<p>scott-
I&rsquo;ve been reading all the threads, and your logo doesn&rsquo;t seem to be progressing too much in the legibility factor. I really think it has to be those squares on the outsides of the letter forms. They require too much focus, drawing your eye away from already difficult to see letter forms. It might just be because they don&rsquo;t serve much of a visual purpose. They don&rsquo;t seem to be at that electronica era yet&hellip;instead they are sort of mimicking the illuminated manuscripts&hellip;vaguely.</p>

<p>Yeah, I can totally see this. I think this is part of the problem with trying to judge something as &lsquo;young and cool&rsquo; - it really depends on the particular subculture. Because of my own location and particular musical background, when you talk about a music magazine aimed at an edgy local music scene, I automatically associate that with something a lot more urban and dance-based (with connections to a completely different graphic style, influenced by graffiti culture, etc).</p>
<p>Maybe it would be helpful for you to be a bit more specific about the type of music culture that this magazine will cover, and thus the audience it&rsquo;s aimed at?</p>
<p>As for the most recent batch of sketches - I don&rsquo;t personally think the &lsquo;track line&rsquo; on the second works, or adds anything to the logo. The more I look at the third one, the more I like it! I didn&rsquo;t really get a good feeling from it at first, but it&rsquo;s definitely grown on me - I like the fact that it&rsquo;s become a continuous line with a single flourish halfway, rather than a kind of ongoing loop with projections all round. I do think that the outer diagonal line of the four should follow the same line all the way down - not suddenly having a vertical edge where it hits the crossbar. Does this make sense? I couldn&rsquo;t think of a clearer way to say it!</p>
<p>Just a final quick question - are you still using a typeface first and then &lsquo;extending&rsquo; it with vector shapes? Your OP seems to suggest this, and if so this is probably why some of the sketches are a little uneven. If this is the case, it might be worth working on this in a purely geometric way, to make sure that line is a bit more even like this - a lot of the time, a geometric logo like this doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;click&rsquo; until it&rsquo;s <em>really</em> even.</p>
<p>Sorry about the essay!</p>

<p>Cool design, but the swastika relation is unfortunately a little too easily connected. It&rsquo;s the very first thing I thought of even before I saw the F4. And I knew it was suppose to say F4.</p>

It&rsquo;s actually an ancient Indian symbol of good fortune, hence the Nazis' use of it :) Not that I made any connection to a swastika when I saw it anyway. The concept is nice, but execution could definitely be improved. Currently it&rsquo;s too blocky and oddly rotated.</p>
<p>So far I haven&rsquo;t seen Scott experimenting with any other concepts at all. The current concept you&rsquo;re working on (Scott) doesn&rsquo;t resemble any of the retro style or figure interplay seen in Scott Hansen&rsquo;s work (as you cited as inspiration in a previous post). I believe someone above said something to the effect of your needing to go back to the basic figures of the &ldquo;F&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;4&rdquo;. I second that comment. It seems like you&rsquo;re just trying a little too hard to connect the shapes here. <strong>To me</strong> continuing to toy around with your current concept is similar to rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic.</p>

<p>Scott,
In regards to your newest set of sketches, I can see that you want to incorporate the character of your base typeface (be it museo, eurostile, whatevs) into the end logo. I think this is a good idea, but one that&rsquo;ll need pretty serious formal consideration for it to work/pop. Too much character overwhelms the form.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/f4_5640.png" alt=""></p>
<p><cite>not cool</cite></p>
<p>Of the throw downs, I prefer istariskoda&rsquo;s:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/F4_4086_6064_6637.png" alt=""></p>
<p>&hellip;because I&rsquo;m a sucker for content and like he said <cite>&ldquo;it’s a shame that the logo doesn’t suggest music.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>You said  <cite>&ldquo;A trendy music zine doesn’t need a treble clef or some deep meaning that’s going to be largely lost on anyone but designers &hellip; this being for a younger audience doesn’t even need to be legible.&quot;</cite></p>
<p>I do not agree. Everything we do as designers is communication, and I&rsquo;m not just harping about legibility here. If you have the opportunity to build a mark firmly rooted in the ideals/culture/mission of the organization, do it! It will only make the logo better, more communicative. Which, in turn promotes audience participation with the piece, which in turn can promote brand loyalty. As you&rsquo;re treating the audience like they are intelligent consumers. Which is where <cite>&ldquo;this being for a younger audience doesn&rsquo;t even need to be legible&rdquo;</cite> comes in. On one level, I totally understand where you&rsquo;re coming from. Most of the stuff these days marketed towards young adults is all over the place formally—shooting out, spiraling in, layered beyond recognition. (perhaps an appropriate reflection of the current younger generation&rsquo;s mindset/mental patterns) However&hellip;from an intellectual, socially responsible designing level, assuming that a younger audience doesn&rsquo;t deserve/want legibility is a very dangerous sentiment.</p>
<p>Whoa! Sorry if that seems like a lecture&hellip;I know you&rsquo;re mostly looking for crits. I am 25(young and hip?)&hellip;and this stuff is in my thoughts right now.</p>
<p>Keep going! You&rsquo;ll get there! Got any links with more info about f4?</p>
<p>–Rachel B</p>
<p>PS who said it had to be a treble clef?  ugh!
PSS let&rsquo;s see potential &ldquo;F4&rdquo; pairings with the next set&hellip;like you said it would be on the cover. (ie type treatment to go along with the mark)</p>

<p>as a mid/late-20s male who loves indie/weird/counterculture/hip music, and has somewhere near 4,000 albums, i can safely say that i am probably the demographic of this logo/mag/zine/whatever.</p>
<p>AND, if i ever saw some kind of mag/zine about hip music that had a logo that was even close to resembling a treble or bass clef or anything near it, i would not buy it. i wouldn&rsquo;t even read it.</p>
<p>speaking purely as a consumer here, and not a designer, those clefs are antiquated and only remind me of classical music a la beethoven or mozart or early 19th century jazz, &amp;c.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just a thought on the ideas based on musical notation - although it&rsquo;s an easy connection to the idea of music in general, I&rsquo;m not really sure that it works in the context. Musical notes to me suggest either a very general musical theme, or a subset more along the lines of classical music, sheet music, etc. Although it&rsquo;s an obvious shorthand for music in general, it&rsquo;s probably not <em>that</em> relevant for a zine dealing with reviews of a more edgy youth music scene, as it references music in a &lsquo;written&rsquo; form rather than something a little more dynamic. It&rsquo;s also, without sounding too dismissive, a little bit of a lazy solution?</p>
<p>Now that I say this, I&rsquo;ve just noticed that since my last preview Gerald has said something along the same lines. I agree, there&rsquo;s a big difference between communicating &lsquo;music&rsquo; in general and appealing to a specific musical subculture.</p>

<p>DaveGK, you are brilliant, this mark is so captivating I&rsquo;d want to buy that magazine just so I had a copy of the logo to look at.  It&rsquo;s sturdy, it&rsquo;s square, it&rsquo;s got a perfect balance of positive/negative space.  It clearly communicates both <em>F</em> and <em>4</em>, and it could be reduced down to a factions of an inch and still be 100% legible.</p>
<p>These are the winners in my eyes, and I hope the reasons are obvious:<img src="/images/old-images/f4-3_6533_5413.jpg" alt="">

But now that I look at it again, I could really see that knocked out in white over a full-bleed cover photo. Nice work!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a lot to add but if I was art directing this i&rsquo;d say go out of your way to avoid any reference to music notes or keyboard commands. I also completely agree that legibility, for this project, shouldn&rsquo;t be a driving factor.</p>
<p>The earlier posts need a lot of work but they have a certain charm and difference and interest to them. The re-works that innovati posted above are misguided and totally off-target for this project and demographic.</p>
<p>I would say you need to explore more but try and avoid the corporate cleverness posted above - it needs that dirty edge with an &lsquo;i don&rsquo;t give a f**k&rsquo; attitude to succeed - not conformity, to be fair i think Scott knows where this should be driven from but before you ask questions like &lsquo;should the right hand loop be there&rsquo; you need to have an amazing and different concept nailed&hellip;.that ain&rsquo;t it.</p>

<p>Reading back, I think I sound a bit rude. What I mean is that those iterations have a very corporate feel to them - they are fantastic and interesting solutions for oil companies and IT Solutions Companies but they miss the mark with the target market. I just think the solution, in this instance, needs to be more progressive - this job gives the freedom to push more boundaries than a typical identity project.</p>

<p>That was my initial reaction, which is why I didn&rsquo;t say anything until after innovati reposted them. But to be honest, I think a good part of that is the dark blue gradient behind the right-hand one - which does give it a bit of a &lsquo;solutions&rsquo; type vibe. Take that away though, and knock it out in white on a decent full-bleed photo cover, and I think it would look anything but. That said, I haven&rsquo;t mocked that up or anything - so it might be just in my head. It might (as with everything in this post) also depend on the context of your musical background too.</p>
