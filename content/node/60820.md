  body: Not sure what you mean. I'm fond of thin spaces either side of a dash.

  body: 'See <a href="http://www.kltf.de/downloads/ATypI2007-CrossingBorders-kltf.pdf">this
    PDF</a>. A method for punctuation spacing is briefly sketched on page 33. In brief:
    Step one, space punctuation marks "normally"; step two, use a special lookup increase
    certain letter to punctuation mark spaces a bit. Also, another old <a href="http://kltf.de/downloads/SpacingIssues-kltf.pdf">PDF

  body: In type design, not in use. I've read tons of material on how to space letters,
    but there seems to be nothing on punctuation.

  body: "I am afraid that spacing is language dependent. My \"Lexique des r\xE8gles
    typographiques en usage \xE0 l'imprimerie nationale\" gives rules for spacing
    punctuation marks in French and those rules are automatically applied when I call
    <code>\\usepackage[french]{babel}</code> in LaTeX.\r\n\r\nMichel"

  body: "Handling language specificity at the application level implies a default
    at the font level.\r\n\r\nThe typical default is fine for most languages, but
    French is peculiar. Vive la diff\xE9rence!\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nIt's important to
    understand editorial usage, especially for the ellipsis. I believe there are some
    Typophile threads on this, with solid advice from Charles Ellertson. \r\n\r\nAs
    for dashes, some fonts give these wider sidebearings than others. \r\n\r\nTry
    to design the question mark with the \"f\" in mind."

  body: "Well, as a user I prefer fonts that use consistent spacing for punctuation.
    If you have ever tried setting tables on a system without a decimal tab, you need
    to know that commas, parens, and periods (as decimal points) will all be a consistent
    width to help align things (along with lining figures with all nine digits the
    same width). I think that most of those fonts will have all the punctuation fitting
    to an en, em, or thin space width (the last being 1/6 em).\r\n\r\nBut there will
    probably be tons of comments on the spacing of the en and em dashes, for instance.
    Personally, it would be ideal to me to have both dashes in two formats, one going
    tight to the side bearings (in books and journals you often need a 3 em dash,
    for instance). But for regular use, a small side bearing similar to the amount
    on letters would save having to kern out when a dash appears in text.\r\n\r\nIn
    this age of alternate characters, we should be able to get both (in which case
    I would want the ones with side bearings as the default)."
