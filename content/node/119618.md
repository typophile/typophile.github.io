  I have both an attachment and link just to be thorough/double sure that the yet
  unidentified font can be visually referenced. The reference image is indeed from
  a video game, so there is a chance that the font was designed specifically for the
  game. If that is the case, what legitimately available font is closest to it? If
  not, what exactly is this font? The key defining element of this font is how the
  lowercase "g" closely resembles the number "8."

    most variations of this font don't use the stylized \"g,\" but a standard one
    instead. After some searching, I found this [[http://www.fontsplace.com/poor-richard-free-font-download.html|version]]
    which does use the 8-like \"g.\""
