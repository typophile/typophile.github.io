    here on Typophile. This topic has been discussed many times. Even using site:google
    search for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20clearview\">Clearview</a>
    will show a bunch of threads. Signage isn't my area of expertise, but even I can
    see that you've improved the situation."

    with Clearview, it's designers were kind enough to provide it to me for research
    purposes and I'm impressed with it's performance in the US.\r\n\r\nDealing with
    two languages does pose some particular problems, not least simply doubling the
    information involved on signs, which with any communications design issue is challenging.\r\n\r\nI'd
    be very interested in hearing about the experience of others in this area, or
    any aspect of dealing with two languages, anyone?\r\n\r\n\r\nGarrett Reil\r\nhttp://raindesign.com\r\nhttp://garrettreil.ie\r\n"

    size and style. The order of languages depends on the majority language of the
    town, so usually it's Finnish first, then Swedish or Sami\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/opaste_6110.png]"

  body: "Thanks Mili\r\n\r\nThat's really interesting, somewhat similar to Wales in
    that the languages are not treated differently. Here in Ireland current signs
    use an odd italic arrangement for Irish to differentiate it from English, which
    is set in uppercase.\r\n\r\nThe sign you posted here is in uppercase - is that
    just used in the approach to a town, or is uppercase used on road signs in general
    there?\r\n\r\nWhat tested well for me, so far, was using colour-differentiation
    between the languages.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type-comparison-for-blog-2_5526.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    our performed the status quo here in Ireland - but also the Welsh design by an
    even greater factor (Irish road users choosing based on clarity).\r\n\r\nGarrett
