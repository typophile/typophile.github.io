  body: It's Beta Sans Bold from Shift Type but their site is down right now. I don't
    know if it's available anywhere else. I recreated a sample.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/betasans.jpg]

  body: Hmmm, that's odd. I ususally have no trouble at all recognising Beta Sans,
    but the all caps setting seems to have thrown me off. Very nice, Chris, good one.
