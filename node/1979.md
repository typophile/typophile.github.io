  next year. It has two designs and I find one offensive. There is the boat Lewis
  and Clark used during their explorations &#40;ho hum&#41; but the other design that
  has a white person shaking the hand of an indian while the type mentions the Louisiana
  Purchase makes me gag. Wasn&#39;t after that purchase the first of the indian wars
  began where the US Government systematicly stold the lands of the Indians. Shake
  their hand and then imprision them for the riches of the west. '

  body: 'Well, OK, you asked for it. <BR> <BR>Quite frankly, I think the &#34;politically
    correct&#34; thought process demonstrates condescension towards those people whom
    the ethos ostensibly defends. It all boils down to some weird left-over Enlightenment
    duality idea that non-Westerners are some sort of receptacles for Western culture
    -- good or bad -- rather than being people with their own motivations and foibles.
    <BR> <BR>If Native Americans want to object to the way they are depicted in American
    culture, rock on. I support their right to express their opinion. I may not necessarily
    share that opinion, or support their movement, but I support their right to speak
    up. <BR> <BR>What gets my goat is when people try to make political points by
    painting one group or another as being a victim. The Aztecs weren&#39;t victims,
    they were the meanest bastards on the continent. Native Americans weren&#39;t
    some special people. They were just people. Wanna-be social scientists concocting
    a myth of Native Americans as being some sort of noble savages is, in my opinion,
    a form of condescension. <BR> <BR>Do people complain about the Mongols murdering
    and raping their way through Europe and the Middle East? Or about the Franks conquering
    the Anglo Saxons? The Moors invading Iberia? No, because respect is involved.
    Two cultures meet. One is hungrier than the other, more desperate, more greedy,
    whatever. They fight. One wins. <BR> <BR>The PC mindset doesn&#39;t allow for
    this. It elevates victimhood to be almost desirable. But in doing so it insults
    the people it supposedly defends. <BR> <BR>What I sensed in Dan&#39;s post was
    the knee-jerk, PC middle class Sociology 101 pissing and moaning that its practitioners
    think is showing respect for this other culture, but really is the exact opposite.
    <BR> <BR>And Steve, don&#39;t pretend for one second you have respect for my opinion.
    You have already labeled me blinkered, which is the same as ignorant. So -- because
    I have a different opinion than you, I&#39;m ignorant? '

    if you were as blinkered as you sound. I see you are. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;blinkered,
    which is the same as ignorant <BR>No, its worse, its wilful disregard which is
    different from just not knowing. Its possible that you are indeed ignorant of
    the holes in your argument, but it actually appears as if you are aware of those
    holes, and too self righteous to care.  <BR> <BR>You ask: &#39;Do people complain
    about the Mongols murdering and raping their way through Europe and the Middle
    East? Or about the Franks conquering the Anglo Saxons? The Moors invading Iberia?&#39;
    <BR>Well I think you might hear a few complaints if the royal mint cast a new
    2 quid piece depicting Harold losing the throne to William the Conqueror in a
    game of scrabble. <BR> <BR>You also complain that &#39;people try to make political
    points by painting one group or another as being a victim&#39;. <BR>Does this
    also count for the last 2 world wars, the holocaust, Vietnam, Uganda, Biafra,
    Rwanda, Somalia, Yugoslavia, Northern Ireland, Indonesia etc etc? <BR>Is your
    answer to all of these: &#39;get over it&#39;?'
