  body: The brand name could be faked with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/">Interstate</a>,
    maybe. The dial numerals look vaguely <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/metropolitain/ef/testdrive.html?s=123456789&amp;p=48">Metropolitain</a>-esque.

  body: Doubt it&#39;s a font but <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eckmann/?refby=typographica"
    target="_blank">Eckmann</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/auriol/?refby=typographica"
    target="_blank">Auriol</a> are interesting alternatives. <BR> <BR>I love looking
    at watch faces for interesting numerals. A recent <BR>trip to a Berlin flea market
    was a watch jackpot!

  body: I think the odds are against the use of a font for the watchface in your sample,
    but if you need a font starting point the numerals of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/poor-richard-rr/monoline/testdrive.html?s=1234567890&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Poor Richard</a> are somewhat similar, particularly the 2.
