  body: It's not part of the traditional typographical world. It's part of the ASCII
    character set which goes back to Teletype days. Generally, it's only used in the
    context of computer code (programming, scripting, command line, etc.). Same goes
    for asciitilde.

  body: 'On my American keyboard, it''s the shifted 6, and I believe is used among
    other things to indicate exponents: x^2 means x squared. The keyboard was done
    by mathematicians, not typographers, which is bad because writing prose is the
    main use of the keyboards, not doing math or code. Eg. the cent sign disappeared
    from the standard basic keyboard, which could have also a true multiplication
    sign, the degree sign, etc.   '

  body: "for questions about basic characters, i usually turn to <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/\">Microsoft's
    Character Design Standards</a> first. If i'm not mistaken, our fellow 'phile [[Vincent
    Connare]] was the one to compile this list of standards. (correct me if i'm wrong!)
    \r\n\r\nasciicircum falls under the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/maths.htm\">Math

  body: "Still, as a math symbol, it's used in the context of computer programming
    languages and such. I don't think I've ever seen it used in a math text book.*
    It's a stand in for the lack of superscripted characters in ASCII just as the
    asterisk and forward slash are used for multiply and divide symbols.\r\n\r\n*
    Although, I went to school before personal computers were common, so maybe that's
    changed?"

  body: Well, the ^ would be used in a math textbook if it were giving instructions
    on how to key an exponential number into a computer, part of a larger section
    on using computers for complex calculations and such.
