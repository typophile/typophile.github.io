body: "I have Becker sat nav in my car, having recently upgraded from an ageing Traffic
  Pro 4740 to a more current, and expensive, Traffic Pro 7949. For all intents and
  purposes it is a green-screen version of their top-end Cascade model.\r\n\r\nAnyway...
  I really like the font they use for the user interface, it comes in a couple of
  weights and sizes. It's quite small but remains legible easily at a glance. I'd
  love to know who created it or how much work went into it.\r\n\r\nSo, recently I
  took a little time and created a version of the bold weight using FontStruct. It
  turned out well, so I'll try to create the normal weight when I manage to collect
  enough samples of it in use.\r\n\r\nhttp://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/becker_bold\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/becker-bold_4716.png]"
