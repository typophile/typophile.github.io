  body: Pencil, meet paper. Lines helpful. Graph paper really nice if you want it
    to be consistent. That's really all you need to start...

  body: Get inspired by some typeface and start improving upon it by sketching on
    paper, scan them up, make evctors with any vector program you are comfortable
    with, graduate to Fontographer/ FontLab and map them onto the characerset one
    by one, generate fonts, test them, finetune them, generate again, fine tune again,...until
    you are happy with the results!

  body: Cook up a general pattern or rule for your typeface, and sketch it (or draw
    it directly on a vector program if you're not as skilled with the pen as I am)
    up. Then see if it works or has good potential. It's very tedious, but for a typophile,
    it's love.

    on how serious you are you could apply to the University or Reading's Typedesign
    MA program or the program at KABK. \r\n\r\nOn a simpler level think about what
    the purpose of the typeface is. Advice re: type design can change depending on
    several factors the more important one of which is probably the purpose of the
    font.\r\n\r\nMy advice is don't look for rules. Instead look for complex relationships
    of factors and tendencies."

    forms and work your way through the calligraphic genesis of our alphabet, all
    the while familiarizing yourself with contemporary font generation software. A
    solid historic(al?) understanding will provide you with the capability to create
    informed contemporary adaptations.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.s. Briem is one of the most informed

    to get started in technical terms. I recommend also to look at the history of
    forms (even in a quick and simple way) to have a better understanding, as typerror
    suggests.

    you're a true designer, and not merely an artist, think about what users need,
    not what you feel like creating. But note that what users <em>say</em> they need

    is all about. And why so few people can actually make things worth keeping. Good

  body: Agree with hrant 100%. It is not design unless it serves a purpose. Start
    with a problem that a new typeface design might help solve. Doing it this way
    will help focus your design and make it distinct.

  body: "I think it's very helpful when you are starting out (once you have started
    sketching) is to print out 2 pages of the same full alphabets. This way you can
    hold them up to the light (or light board) and see proportions and relations.
    So for example how a \"u\" and an \"s\" fit together. or how wide an \"M\" is
    compared to an \"H\". Stuff like that. It's almost enlightening the first time
    you do it. :) Pick a font that you are sort of going for. So say baskerville for
    a nice old style typeface, or helvetica if you want to go all swiss designy like.\r\n\r\n\r\ncourtney"

    and the pen, and found they are both exceedingly useful in the end. Doubting these
    two things is equally exceedingly useful too. Don't be too keen to throw out the
    old things, and don't be too keen to retain them either.\r\n\r\n<em>If you\u2019re

    but I'm a true artist as well in the sense that I try to renew the tradition I
    belong to by creating original works. Stop bashing artists because <strong>there
    is an art to design</strong>. Type design involves both strong design skills and
    an agenda devoted to design, and type design involves artistry. Get over the art
    part and stop referring to it. It's starting to get boring and you're starting
    to sound like a parody of yourself Hrant. No really.\r\n\r\nArt is neccessary,
    and this is coming from a guy who is very big on design.\r\n\r\n<em>think about
    what users need, not what you feel like creating.</em>\r\n\r\nI did both, and
