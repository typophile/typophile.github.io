  featuring in all of their new advertising and I want to know what it is!\r\n\r\nit
  reminds me of Optima, because it's a sans-serif that has a gentle flare at the ends,
  but it's too *fun* to be optima, which I onsider much more refined and formal.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  here's a link to their website, and it's featured in the flash banner on the mainpage.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.timhortons.com/en/index.html\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help, and if you were near me, I'd buy you a coffee! (At Timmy's of course)"

    ruined by outlines. The motion stuff moves too fast for these old eyes. I could
    be very wrong! The low slung cross on the t and the exaggerated terminal, swolen
    sans leads me to believe I am .... maybe right. He was one of the finest calligraphic/lettering
    artists and teachers of our time. See Berthold... Pontifex Laudatio Residenz Paladin(sp)
    etc. His most outstanding student, Werner Schneider... see Linotype Senatus Libretto
    etc.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Aha!  those 'old eyes' of yours have sniper-like precision!\r\n\r\nit appears
    to be the first one you mentioned there, Laudatio, although it has been hurt by
    stretching and applying outlines.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to gain some sensitivity
    towards typefaces and I know I've got a long road ahead of me, but it's discouraging
    when most designers my age just don't care about typography at all.  What I wouldn't
    give to have your type sensitivity!\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "I have always loved Poppl's type and lettering. I started as a calligrapher
    and the \"sensitivity\" developed from that. Go and take a class from a REPUTABLE
    calligrapher and you will be on your way. Try and get in touch with Ruth Booth
    in Toronto! Check out both Poppl and Schneider on the sites I recommended. They
    are true \"finessers\" of letterforms. \r\n\r\nCome to Buffalo for Typecon and
    I will bring some of their work. It will blow you away!\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Typecon in Buffalo eh?  I have a sister living not too far from there (well,
    Olean NY)  When is this Typecon and how much $ will it set me back?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    about calligraphy, I've always been a little handicapped towards ink writing as
    a lefty, I think I'd need special consideration from either a lefty calligrapher
    or a truly skilled one, which I haven't run across yet.\r\n\r\nlast year I knew
    a handful of typefaces by sight, and know of a lot more - this year when I go
    out I see typefaces first, then the words set in them on signs and menus.\r\n\r\nI
    can only wonder with childish glee what this could develop into in 10 or 20 years
    :)  I can't wait."

  body: "OK Tom, let me go out on a limb here. My daughters are your age. I remember
    them making the sign of LOSER years ago. You are holding your left hand up with
    the same gesture except away from the forehead. Is this a subconscious attempt
    to say LEFTY??? If so you are very subtle and you should have no problems with
    subtle letterforms cause that went past me on first glance! Or maybe I am over
    reaching.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "hahaha oh how incredibly observant!  I was actually pointing at a nametag
    that's too small to see at that resolution, although to do so I didn't *have*
    to make that 'L' shape with my thumb.  Maybe I'm advertising my leftishness more
    than I thought (on a subconcious level)\r\n\r\nNow, when we got to drawing class
    in college it made me so delighted when all the right-handers were complaining
    about getting the sides of their hands dirty from drawing with graphite sticks.
    \ This is the burden lefties have to bear from grade 1.\r\n\r\nActually, you might
    find this amusing, we used to call graphite or charcoal stains on our hands and
    wrists the \u2018GD tan\u2019 because only us in graphic design could get it.
    (and we didn't have real tans because we were inside doing work)\r\n\r\nI know
    an old designer, a family friend (probably influenced me more than I know) and
    he wa taught lettering when he studied \u2018commercial arts\u2019 back in the
    day.  I wonder if he'd like to help me out a bit with writing\u2026"
