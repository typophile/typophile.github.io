  to several people\r\nwho are not so familiar with InDesign. I do not have time at
  the moment to kern the\r\ntypeface. Does anyone know a python script that can import
  optical kerning\r\nvalues from InDesign to Fontlab? \r\nThanks.\r\n"

  body: 'If you do a search on Adobe''s optical kerning here, you will find that there
    are a lot of problems with it. If it is spaced well, you are probably better off
    with no kerning, or lightly kerning a few characters like fVWT, and letting it
    go at that. Some people have successfully used the [[http://ikern.com/k1/|ikern
    service]].  '

  body: "i am aware of the problems. i know how indesign optical spacing works. my
    question is simply if anyone knows a script that can take the kerning values from
    indesign to fontlab. let us not waste time by discussing what good spacing is,
    etc... thanks.\r\n"

  body: I don't think it exists, but that's just a guess. Igino Marini from iKern
    can create quite good spacing and kerning in a matter of days.

  body: IIRC, InDesign optical kerning is, like the paragraph composer engine, based
    on complex, patented algorithms. Due to this, I don't think it could be translated
    into a script.

  body: "I seem to remember something like this.\r\n\r\nSee if this script from Georg
    Siefert might help with you have in mind:\r\n\r\nhttp://mac.softpedia.com/get/Graphics/Make-Kern-File.shtml\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    not Python. It\u2019s Javascript that you have to run in InDesign on a single
    text frame (can be threaded over many pages) and output an AFM file. But you might
    be able to press it into service for your needs, if you don\u2019t find anything
    else more direct.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll read out the Optical Metrics
    values directly. And, of course, you have to provide the kern-pair strings. What
    I think you\u2019d have to do is go through your kerning text string and manually
    override and reset each value in order to have the script pull them out to AFM.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I mean by that is that you\u2019d have to advance your cursor between each kern
    pair and hit option-leftarrow to override the Optical value, then immediately
    hit option-rightarrow to return to the value determined by Optical metrics, but
    now as a manual kern that the script will detect and harvest. (Maybe you could
    script that action locally just to speed things up.)\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know
    if that description made sense, or if this will help you.\r\n\r\n(I\u2019m sparing
    you my considerable rant against the Adobe Optical Kerning routine. ;-)"
