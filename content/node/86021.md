body: "I'm having trouble matching this typeface. (see linked photo) Apologies for
  quality of photo, but it's the best I have. I am looking to match the lettering
  on the engine nacelle where it reads \"The Boys of Syracuse\" (If you zoom in, there
  is a fair amount of detail) I've been through all my blackletter fonts, but nothing
  comes close. The letter \"T\" seems to be the toughest to match. It is possible
  that this lettering was hand painted (these planes were painted before digital typesetting
  was widespread), so I may never find a perfect match, but if I can get close enough
  that a little hand-tweaking to the letterforms will put me there, I would be happy.
