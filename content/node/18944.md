  Sony Reader. The idea is that people will buy books electronically and read them
  on this device, rather than buying a printed book. I'm sure we can debate the theoretical
  market for such a device and whether it will actually sell, but my main beef with
  it is the horrific typography.  \r\n\r\nI've attached a couple of Sony's official
  media shots. The word spacing is sad, rivers galore, and why'd they try setting
  it all justified? And are we expected to read all our books in Times New Roman?
  (Particularly offensive are the undoubtedly faux italics.)\r\n\r\nHow does one contact
  Sony to help them address their, uh, issues?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SonyReader.jpg]\r\n"

  body: 'Seriously the type is a bit tragic, and that seems to go for most of their
    products - PS3 "Spiderfont" a case in point. I''ve tried to contact various people
    at Sony to see if they have any interest in licensing any of our types, and I''m
    sure other players (Bitstream, Monotype, Ascender) have tried as well. I think
    one of their issues is lack of a central typography group. '

    that the typography seems to be an afterthought. And in this day and age of OpenType,
    it seems this Sony product doesn't even appear to support ligatures."

    product.\r\n\r\nThat type is just painful on the eyes. I think that people will
    eventually move away from books and on to screen. But not while this product looks
    this way."

  body: "That isn't what I meant. I really don't know much about Apple and typography,
    so I can't speak to the matter.\r\n\r\nBut try to remember the first MP3 players.
    They weren't user friendly, and no single player seemed to catch on. The phenomena
    seemed like it would lag behind portable CD-players for some time.\r\n\r\nThen
    came the iPod. Say what you like about the product or its market share, I'm just
    pointing out that it brought MP3 players into prime time. Someday, there will
    be a similar eBook reader. Who knows who will make it\u2026 maybe even Sony. But
    not yet."

    DRM would be better, and the book publishers would gripe about the royalties.
    ;-) \r\n \r\nThe other ebook device due out is from a Philips spin-off so maybe
    we'll see some Bitstream fonts and technology on the device...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.engadget.com/2006/03/19/irex-reveals-deets-on-its-iliad-ebook-reader/\r\n\r\nBut
    the quality of their spec PDF doesn't instill much confidence. "

  body: "Not to engage on overgeneralization, but the Japanese tend to have spectactularly
    good Kanji typography, and equally bad Roman. Kanji doesn't have serious problems
    with hyphenation, justification, word spacing, and doesn't have a true italic.
    Therefore, it seems, those problems weren't solved in this product.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's easily hackable (I've heard rumors it runs some kind of Linux inside), I
    think I'll get one. The physical device itself sounds pretty yummy, and I'm obviously
    interested in grayscale displays because FontFocus works in gray where ClearType
    does not."
