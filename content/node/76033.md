body: "I was examining a paperback copy of the book \"The No-Asshole Rule\" in the
  airport. I was curious how you get a whole book out of a title that seems fairly
  self-explanatory. \r\n\r\nThe text was set in ITC Garamond, which would be bad enough
  on its own, but the italic used in the text was not ITC Garamond italic, but rather
  Adobe Garamond italic. At that point, the book lost all credibility, because despite
  the title, it was clear that an asshole had been allowed to handle the typography.
  No-Asshole Rule: flagrantly violated.\r\n\r\nYet that seemed harsh. Surely the designer
  is not an asshole. Maybe just inept? Or afflicted with bad taste? But ultimately
  neither of these explanations was convincing. \r\n\r\nFirst, this is a book that's
  in an airport bookstore as a paperback. That means it's popular and the publisher
  has already sold a bunch of copies. There's budget to hire a decent book designer.
  \r\n\r\nSecond, to combine ITC Garamond and Adobe Garamond like this requires a
  willful act of perversity and disharmony. It would be easier to just use ITC Garamond
  italic. But here, the book designer expended time and labor to produce something
  even uglier. \r\n\r\nSo, I'm sticking with asshole."

  body: You are assuming some actual thought went into that decision. My guess is
    that 4th edition paperbacks that end up in airports are done "by computer" meaning
    humans are forbidden from taking part in the process because they require an hourly
    rate and health insurance. My guess is that Adobe Garamond Italic came earliest
    on the font menu so was selected. No one cares what poor schleps who can only
    buy books in airports have to suffer.  After all, they are about to get crammed
    into a tincan with bad air and poor service where they will not only contract
    some dreaded disease but be late for their meeting anyway. ;-) That surely is
    a job coveted only by assholes.

  body: Maybe someone was foolishly relying on Panose font matching and it went horribly
    awry. But yeah, using ITC Garamond for text in 2010 is pretty awful.
