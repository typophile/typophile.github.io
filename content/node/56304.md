  on Diana Krall's new album Quiet Nights. To me it looked first as hand drawn but
  the 'a' appears to repeat almost exactly that leads me to believe it's a typeface/font.\r\n\r\nSam[img:sites/default/files/old-images/-1_5691.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone has any suggestions for me to pass onto her as to where she can find this
  that would be a great help. Thanks,\r\n\r\n"
