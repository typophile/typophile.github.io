body: "The September edition of the Metal Type newsletter is now out.\r\n\r\nPlenty
  of new stuff has been added to the site and forum. And don't forget, there's no
  need to register for an account to post on the forum now, so it's easier than ever
  to comment.\r\n\r\nI recently posted some pictures of the Linotype Museum in Schopfheim,
  Germany onto the Forum. They were taken by a guy called TypeOff, who posted them
  on Flickr. Unfortunately he didn't have enough time at the museum to picture each
  machine individually. If anyone has pictures of the individual machines at that
  museum, or is in a position to be able to go and take them, I would be most interested
  in getting them up on the main Metal Type site. Please email me through the Metal
  Type website.\r\n\r\nClick the link below to take a look at this month's video newsletter,
  which includes some footage of a World War 2 Spitfire at the end:\r\nhttp://j.mp/k5KA95\r\n\r\nWould
  you like to get the monthly Metal Type newsletter? It is now full HTML, usually
  with a picture or two, and comes out once a month on the first of the month. Click
  the link below to enter your details:\r\nhttp://j.mp/n3wkjc\r\n\r\nAll the Best\r\nDave
