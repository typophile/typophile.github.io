body: I'm open to suggestions for a killer typeface to use for the body copy in this
  small magazine I'm putting together. The general feel for this issue is high-end,
  sophisticated and cutting edge. I'll take suggestions for serif or sans serif typefaces.

  body: If you want your type to look high-end and cutting edge you need to commission
    custom type. Otherwise you're just using the licensing the same type anyone else
    can.

  body: Thanks for the advice, but I'm not sure a custom type face is the right thing
    for this job. There are so many existing fonts out there that I'm sure someone
    can suggest one I haven't looked into yet.

  body: "I have to agree with Nick on that one. Those are classic \"safe\" typefaces,
    there is so much more to investigate... I only suggest using these if you have
    to, if they are really fitting to the character of the magazine, or the brand
    is firmly established. Or use them as a spring-board to find something similar
    but not so pedestrian. More often, I tend to think everything wants to have its
    own custom type :)\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    is, I would if I had anything to show. Choosing a typeface is always a huge decision
    for me and usually the first thing I do once I know the overal aesthetic of the
    project I'm going to be working on.\r\n\r\nThe magazine can't be too high-end...it's
    a school publication and the budget is almost nothing. I'm trying to do a lot

    your readers would get it, even if it's a private school with very wealthy pupils.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, this is marginally better than the usual way designers approach
    youth, with fun, trendy, sloppy banality, distress and bright colours for the
    kids.\r\n\r\nSurely there has to be a better way to \"target this demographic\"?"

  body: "@Nick Shinn...my school, The Art Institute of California - Orange County,
    puts out a small magazine every quarter for the student body. This magazine is
    the assignment for one of my classes this quarter and I'm the Art Director for
    the project. Usually, this magazine is nothing to brag about, but I'd like to
    change that with my issue. It just so happens that this is the 10th Anniversary
    of my school and they want to make this issue special. My goal is to produce something
    that the students won't just throw away; to make it something they want to keep
    around. I'm doing this by slightly altering the usual dimensions of the magazine,
    kicking up the visual quality to levels not seen in previous issues, making reading
    it a very tactile experience with lots of spot UV throughout, etc.\r\n\r\nYou
    ask why, if virtually no one will see it, would I want to make \"a school magazine
    feel high-end, sophisticated and cutting edge?\". The answer is simple: I take
    pride in my work. And in addition to it being a 10th Anniversary edition, if it
    comes out like I want it to, it's something I'll put in my portfolio. I'm no spring
    chicken...just a few months shy of my 30th birthday. \r\n\r\nI hope that gives
    you a little more insight into my reasoning for wanting a mere school magazine
    to look like more than it really is."

  body: "<em>...if virtually no one will see it...</em>\r\n\r\nI meant they won't
    \"get it\" (grok?), if \"high-end, sophisticated\" isn't their normal cultural
    milieu, which is a reasonable assumption for school students. But perhaps I underestimated
    the sophistication of your readers, and no doubt it's true many people admire
    upscale glamour, even if they can't afford it. Although I would imagine that the
    students at your particular school are pretty well off.\r\n\r\nI wasn't implying
    that it was a \"mere\" school magazine -- there is no value-judgement in identifying
    different economic tranches for marketing purposes. In fact, IMO \"high-end\"
    is often tacky, relying on expensive materials (e.g. white space) and profuse
    workmanship to impress. Bling.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to target (match) the work to
    the audience, not merely to create something exceptional for one's peers and portfolio.\r\n\r\n<em>My
    goal is to produce something that the students won't just throw away; to make
