  body: 'Thanks for the link to the interesting article. There are books with more
    extensive information and illustrations of typesetting history - you might see
    if you can get copies of the two volumes of Daniel Berkeley Updike''s ''Printing
    Types: Their History, Forms and Use''. There are quite a few histories of type
    with images of book covers and title pages from the days of yore.'
