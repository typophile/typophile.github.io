  body: "Thank you.\r\n\r\nWell, Actually I have seen this one before, and somehow
    I remembered Koen Hachmangs work. :) <em>( I think that one even was nominated,
    years ago, for some free font type contest. )</em>\r\n\r\nOoh, And, I looove 'Baby
    Mine', as well. :) A fabulous, and still fresh, alternate for all those Bauhaus
    and Chalet users and 'abusers'. :)\r\n\r\nDav"

    body: Yes, that's true, but I think they expanded the family to other weights
      like Bold.
