  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, <BR> <BR>I was looking on the web to find a version of Univers which I encountered some time ago, called &#39;Univers BQ&#39;. I think this was a digital version from Berthold &#40;but now it can&#39;t be found on their new site&#41;. It was a superior digitalisation than the Adobe/Linotype one &#40;See also Detailtypografie by Forssman &amp; de Jong&#41;. And it had the original &amp;-sign!  <BR>I know there is something like the Neue Univers &#40;with the new numbering system&#41; from Linotype, but I don&#39;t like it as much as the old one. Could this old &#39;Univers BQ&#39; version be for sale somewhere? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/4653.gif" alt="univers"></div>

I&#39;m enough of a geek that I&#39;ve read the biographies of Renner, Bruce Rogers, Jan Tschichold, Baskerville, Goudy, and probably a couple of others.

		<div class="commentbody">Isaac, <BR> <BR>The alternative letters are pretty fun. Since Futura has so many round shapes, you can substitute an alternate <i>a,</i> for instance, in a word like <i>page,</i> where you would otherwise have three circles one-after-another. Having read Hrant&#39;s pages, I would now say that this improves the Bouma. The alternative characters can break the pattern, and even substituting a single letter can radically change the look of Futura. <BR> <BR>There were originally several other characters</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I believe the only digital Univers with the Et ampersand are the Linotype Univers and the BQ Univers.

There are plenty of sources around for the artwork, including old Letraset catalogues &#40;only available as rub-down lettering as far as I remember&#41;. <BR> <BR>Tiffany, were you asking whether the Univers grid you referenced was an original? Hard to tell from your image, but there&#39;s lots of reprints of it in lots of books - I think even the A4 flyer/samples were reprinted, I&#39;ve seen them in bookshops for a couple of quid. <BR> <BR>Hmm, Futura, it&#39;s nice to see some of the more experimental, original forms, especially those &#34;g&#34;s.</div>

However, again, I&#39;d say that the influence was Bauhaus/Modernism rather than art-deco. <BR> <BR>Whichever, they both originate in the 1930s. <BR> <BR>Stephen, I don&#39;t believe I have anything to prove - read Rudolfo&#39;s later post.

I mailed Adobe about this a little while ago - you know of course that now the Adobe Univers is available as OpenType? Anyway, I remarked to them that a new digital Univers, without the &#34;proper&#34; ampersand, seemed like a missed opportunity to me - they could have had it as an alternate form. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s been changed.</div>
