body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nI have a project designing instruction sheets for a mid-sized
  company. They exist in the PC world and are not interested in purchasing any fonts.
  As a matter of fact, the company Logotype is set in Univers 67 which causes them
  some problems because they do not have the font. So using the Univers family is
  out. When I asked what do they have, so I can know my choices, they told me they
  mostly use Arial. My question is what are the typical fonts pre-installed on PCs?
  and of those which would you recommend? The instruction sheets have a fair amount
  of running text and there is a hierarchy of heads and subheads.\r\n\r\nI welcome
  any and all input.\r\n\r\nKirsten"

  body: Thank you both for responding. As I was looking at the list, I also thought
    Franklin Gothic could be a good choice. However do you think it is suitable for
    paragraphs of text? I'm also concerned that there is only one weight available
    (plus an ital). Should I look for a serif and use Franklin Gothic for heads?
