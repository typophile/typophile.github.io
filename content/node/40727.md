  free, seasonal promotional calendars. I use it myself to describe stuff that looks
  too trendy and too busy. I wondered: what do we mean when we say something is overdesigned?
  What makes something overdesigned? How do you quantify design so that you can recognise
  when there is too much? What is the difference, if any between badly designed and
  over designed?\r\n\r\nMaybe an object is overdesigned when it's visually appealing
  but its function (so readability/useabilty/legibility) has been impeded by too many
  concepts or design elements or where an information system has been imposed where
  none is required (such as colour coding, directional arows, subtitles etc). Maybe
  it's also where the design is constantly 'noticed' so that it becomes irritating,
  when it should be subservient to an object's function and so, after a period of
  time, disappear into the background as 'design'.\r\n\r\nKind of incoherent sorry,
  what are your thoughts? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    painters work you can catch them wondering when a painting is finished. We all
    know approximately how subjective the idea of finished is, but we also can look
    at something and know when it has been worked a little too long.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    there is a point where every element is necessary and more is too much. You wisely
    hear graphic designers comment for attempting to pull information together without
    resorting to the use of bold. It is another attempt to reign in the desire to
    overdecorate and overcompensate. I think designers really need good writers and
    editors to bring communication into a tight form. This makes success possible."

    the other way in my design, to what I think most designers do; I started off being
    quite cautious and fearful of designiness and little elements and bolding and
    boxing things off and expressiveness for its own sake but just ended up with things
    that were functional but very plain and boring. I realised firstly, that I just
    didn't know how to do that other stuff and secondly, that the design that appealed
    to me wasn't plain and brutish like the stuff I came up with but more nuanced
    and massaged. I'm guess nowadays I'm trying to learn how to use detail to make
    things look... well... better for want of a better way of describing it.\r\n\r\nBut,
    no, I never know when I've finished, I stop when I've hemorrhaged enough time
    and the deadline rises up to smack me in the face."

    ads, I wanted to make them look \"pretty,\" so I used things like Emigre's Tribute
    or H&FJ's Requim or fancy stuff like fleurons and whatever. (Surprized I didn't
    use Lagarto...)\r\n\r\nBut then after a while I realized that nobody cared, and
    what was worse, that the ad next to it set in all caps Helvetica caught more people's
    attention and thus served its purpose better. And it took 1/8 of the time to create.\r\n\r\nI
    think it's refered to in the industry as \"straight out of art school\" and it
    takes a while in the trenches to figure it out."

    By that definition, you cannot over-design. However you can pass the point of
    good design into bad design.

  body: "Overdesign means trying to impress and persuade with technique that does
    not fully address the needs of the content.\r\nIt can be hard to gauge how much
    professional slickness is enough, but clients are pretty good at keeping creatives
    on track.\r\nHowever, in certain circumstances, that check and balance is not
    so evident, for instance pro bono work, and graphic trade marketing--to creatives--which
    is assumed to require in-your-face expression that will be appreciated for its
    own sake. \r\n\r\n"
