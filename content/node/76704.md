  body: The big size actually lowers the readability here (96 ppi). The leading should
    be increased. You declare font-sizes 48 times in your css. This is too much. You
    make excessive use of classes and IDs. Are they really all necessary?

  body: "@Arne: Just lean back. It's good for your eyes.\r\n\r\nBut, yes, the body
    text needs a kick in the line-height parameter. It's 4px under the font-size right
    now, causing ascenders and descenders to tangle.\r\n\r\nWonder if folk will ever
    figure out that setting font sizes in px will bite them in the fluffbunny on multi-hundred-dpi
    displays..."

  body: "Well, they may or they may not, depending on how intelligent the browser
    is. 12px on a 96 dpi (standard) display should be scaled to 38px on a 300 dpi
    display. There's no reason px has to map to actual device pixels.\r\n\r\nFor example,
    with Apple's double-resolution \"Retina\" display, px doesn't map to pixels anymore.
    And of course it never really did since Mobile Safari scales the page in various
    ways as the user manipulates it.\r\n"

  body: "I don't know if I'm too tired or not, but the W3C's px unit looks like an
    effin mess to me. The pathological case would be that 1px should jump to five
    actual pixels in length if I moved to a coupla fathoms away from the display.\r\n\r\nI
    need a beer."

  body: "I like the larger font size myself, but I think it does look better small,
    sad to say. For example the replies here. That is a nice looking font and size,
    but I want my website font bigger.\r\n\r\nI found this and was trying to implement
    some of what the person is saying.\r\nhttp://www.threestyles.com/tutorials/css-tips-for-better-typography/\r\n\r\nArno,
    it a template, I'm just editing it. I'll go in and clean up the CSS though, I
    figured it needed to be that way.\r\n\r\nI'll change all the fonts from px to
    em. I never use the em because it seems to make everything HUGE and I don't understand
    it. I'll read up on it. What should the line-height be in relation to the em?
    If the font size is 1em what should the leading be?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "On my private pages I use mm (millimetres), an absolute size. Mind, they
    are mostly a fanfic library, so the expectation that 4.23mm (12pt) remain 4.23mm
    nomatter if your display unit resolves 3.8dpmm (~96dpi) or 47dpmm (~1200dpi) sounds
    reasonable to me.\r\n\r\nThe em is a relative size. 1em is 100% of the parent's
    font-size parameter.\r\n\r\nBtw: I copied your page onto my machine, then went...
    playful... on it.\r\n\r\n1. I copied the 'font-family' from 'body' to '.entry',
    then changed the one in 'body' to be an Arial/Helvetica/sans-serif catch-all.
    In 'body' I also dropped 'line-height'.\r\n2. To 'font'family' in '.entry' I added
    Droid Serif and Nimrod, both of which are tall-x types that put up with a font-size
    of 13px.\r\n3. I added 'font-style: normal' to '.entry p:first-child:first-letter'
    since I preferred to see the cap upright.\r\n\r\nJust for the hack, I then tried
    it with the freely-available (and GPLed) ADF types:\r\n1. Added 'Gillius ADF'
    to '.smallheadline1', '.smallheadline2' and '#menu a'.\r\n2. Added 'Tribun ADF
    Std' to ',entry' and upped 'font-size' to 14px.\r\n3. Added 'Tribun ADF Std' to
    '#content div .largeheadline'.\r\n4. Added 'Tribun ADF Std Cond' to '#blogtitle
    h2' and '#tag'.\r\n5. Added 'Universalis ADF Std' to 'body'.\r\n6. Added an '.entry
    blockquote' subsection:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n\t.entry p:first-child::first-letter
    {\r\n\t\tfont-style: normal;\r\n\t\tfont-size: 3.571em;\r\n\t\tline-height: 0.76em;\r\n\t\tpadding:
    0.04em 0.08em 0 0;\r\n\t\tcolor: #C00;\r\n\t\tfloat: left;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t.entry
    blockquote {\r\n\t\tfont-family: \"Ikarius ADF No2 Std\";\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t.entry
    blockquote p:first-child::first-letter {\r\n\t\tfont-size: 2.571em;\r\n\t\t\t}</code>\r\n\r\nFYI,
    Gillius is a Gill Sans look-a-like, Tribun resembles Times and Universalis has
    a Futura flavour. Not sure about Ikarius."
