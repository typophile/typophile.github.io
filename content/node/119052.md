  helps me identify the name of this rare typeface in complete form, from A to Z.
  Thanks!\r\nThe only clue that I found recently about this font, is that it belongs
  to Laurent et Deberny Foundation, Paris, acquired by D. Stempel Agency and currently
  owned by Lynotype. \r\nRegards!\r\nDelia Petrescu\r\n"
