		<div class="commentbody">Hey, great idea! <BR>So you need to sequence the glyphs in ascending &#34;potential distinctiveness&#34;, right? Like lc &#34;el&#34; could be the first one and lc &#34;g&#34; the 8th. An &#34;early&#34; candidate might be lc &#34;h&#34; and a late one UC &#34;Q&#34;. You could also throw in extended-Latin stuff, like an &#34;a-ogonek&#34; as 6th or something. So three more for the middle, maybe &#34;f&#34; for 5th and &#34;J&#34; for 3rd and &#34;y&#34; for 4th? <BR> <BR>So I got: lhJyfaQg <BR> <BR>&#62; I should add that the choices are limited to 4 uppercase and 4 lowercase or figures.  <BR> <BR>Why? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s another idea: have a speed test too, where people get to say how many seconds they need to identify a font, and you flash a pangram for increasing durations. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">if any of you remember the game NAME THAT TUNE i was thinking along those lines. and as hrant pointed out i think the letters shown should start with most difficult and become easier. for instance, imagine Nick v. Thomas ... Nick says &#34;I can name that typeface in 8 characters.&#34; And then Nick says, &#34;oh yeah! well I can name that typeface in 7 characters.&#34; And then Thomas says, &#34;I don&#39;t believe it. Name that typeface.&#34; At this point we would show seven characters &#40;out of the 8&#41;, leaving the easiest character out of the showing. It will be done on teams though, with each team having a leader.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think having a fixed set/sequence of characters: <BR>1&#41; helps the organizer&#40;s&#41;. <BR>2&#41; promotes strategizing &#40;like Kent said&#41;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think there should be teams - there should be a qualification round &#40;maybe show a couple of complete 8-glyph sets to everybody, get them to write and hand in their answers, and the first 8 corrent respondents qualify&#41;, and then have a pairwise elimination tree, with quarter and semi finals, and a final. <BR> <BR>As for closed/open book, one big advantage of meatspace versus virtual interaction is that you can prevent people from checking references, so I think you should take advantage of that. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, here&#39;s another option: instead of asking &#34;how many glyphs do you need to identify the font&#34;, show the glyphs slowly &#40;like 5 seconds each&#41; and the first correct respondent wins. If the first respondent is incorrect, the other guy has until the time limit to answer correctly, otherwise there&#39;s a rematch. <BR> <BR>Audience members shouting out answers will be hung by their finials. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
