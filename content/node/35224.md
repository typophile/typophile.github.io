  using Gill Sans (as someone on this board already recommended).

  body: "Gill Sans actually isn\u2019t free. However, some weights of it ship with
    OSX. Which isn\u2019t free.\r\n\r\nFor the serif: Check out the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14652\">FAQ
    Free</a>. <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/CharisSILfont\">Charis SIL</a> is <em>somewhat</em>
    similar to Scala Serif\u2014if you don\u2019t take account of much more than the
    angled serifs. <a href=\"http://www.bitstream.com/font_rendering/products/dev_fonts/vera.html\">Bitstream
    Vera</a> comes in matching Sans, Serif & Mono.\r\n\r\nThen of course, Scala is
    rather unique\u2014<a href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/shop/index.ep?clist=PS,12486&cview=P12486\">and
    it starts from $40</a> \u2026"
