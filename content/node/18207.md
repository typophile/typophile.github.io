body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Good Libre Fonts</strong>\r\n\r\nThis
  wiki page collects fonts which meet two criteria:\r\n\r\n1. They are free, in the
  \"libre\" rather than \"gratis\" sense of the word. In the free software world,
  this distinction is often phrased as \"free as in speech\" as opposed to \"free
  as in beer.\" The fonts on this page are all released under licenses compatile with
  the <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/social_contract\">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>,
  which is the usual metric in the free software world. The <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php\">Open
  Source Definition</a> is similar, and in the vast majority of cases will cover exactly
  the same licenses.\r\n\r\nCompatible licenses include GPL, OFL, and public domain.
  Incompatible licenses include most of the Creative Commons licenses (see <a href=\"http://people.debian.org/~evan/ccsummary.html\">here</a>
  for a summary), AFPL, and all \"free for noncommercial use\" licenses. Perhaps someone
  will feel moved to create a [[Good Gratis Fonts]] page.\r\n\r\n2. They are pretty
  good, by the consensus of the [[typophile]] community. There are a lot of really
  terrible free fonts out there, but relatively few good ones. This is the page for
  those.\r\n\r\n<strong>URW Collection</strong>\r\n\r\nSome time in the mid-90's (todo:
  get exact date), Artifex Software, the maintainers and commercial licensors of Ghostscript,
  funded the donation to the GPL world of the [[URW]] font set compatible with the
  standard PostScript 35. These fonts include: Nimbus Roman No. 9 (clone of [[Times
  Roman]]), Nimbus Sans (clone of [[Helvetica]]), Nimbus Mono (clone of [[Courier]]),
  Century Schoolbook L (clone of [[New Century Schoolbook]]), URW Bookman L (clone
  of [[Bookman]]), Palladio (clone of [[Palatino]]), URW Chancery L (clone of [[Zapf
  Chancery]]), Standard Symbols L (clone of [[Symbol]]), and Dingbats (clone of [[Zapf
  Dingbats]]).\r\n\r\nThese fonts are included in all Linux distributions, and also
  form the basis for a number of extension and internationalization projects, including
  <a href=\"http://www.nongnu.org/freefont/\">freefont</a> and Valek Filippov's <a
  href=\"ftp://ftp.gnome.ru/fonts/urw/release/\">cyrillic releases</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>[[Gentium]]</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium\">Gentium</a>
  font, designed by Victor Gaultney under the auspices of SIL, is now released under
  the new OFL font license.\r\n\r\n<strong>Doulos SIL</strong>\r\nThe <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/DoulosSILfont\">Doulos
  SIL</a> font, similar to SIL Doulos, originally an IPA font by SIL International,
  is now released under the new OFL font license. Wide coverage of Latin and Cyrillic.\r\n\r\n<strong>Charis
  SIL</strong>\r\nThe <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/CharisSILfont\">Charis SIL</a>
  font, similar to Bitsream Charter by Matthew Carter, released under OFL by SIL International
  is the creator of the font. Wide coverage of Latin and Cyrillic.\r\n\r\n<strong>JUnicode</strong>\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://junicode.sourceforge.net/\">JUnicode</a> is another font with a very
  strong emphasis on Unicode coverage and internationalization. It has essentially
  complete coverage of the Latin ranges in Unicode, and is thus suitable for Old English,
  IPA, and other such scripts.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vera</strong>\r\n\r\nBitstream and Gnome
  have released the <a href=\"\">Vera</a> font family (based on Proxima, and with
  fairly good TrueType hinting) under an open license. There are a number of derivatives,
  including <a href=\"http://tavmjong.free.fr/FONTS/\">Arev</a> and <a href=\"http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\">DejaVu</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>DejaVu</strong>\r\nThe
  <a href=\"http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\">DejaVu</a> fonts
  are public domain additions to the Bitstream Vera fonts. Wide coverage of Latin,
  Greek and Cyrillic.\r\n\r\n<strong>Charter</strong>\r\n\r\nBitstream Charter, by
  [[Matthew Carter]], is freely available from <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/fonts/charter/\">TUG</a>
  and other sources.\r\n\r\n<strong>Adobe Utopia</strong>\r\n\r\nSee the note below.\r\n\r\n<strong>Droid
  fonts</strong>\r\nAs used on the Android platform, are licensed under Apache License
  2.0. Made by Ascender. \r\n\r\n<strong>Honorable mention</strong>\r\n\r\nThe [[Computer
  Modern]] fonts distributed with TeX are just below the level of quality intended
  for this page, but have a number of interesting properties and are in fairly wide
  use for math typesetting. The main font in the family is essentially a clone of
  Monotype Modern No. 8. Interestingly, these fonts were among the very earliest digital
  fonts to implement [[Optical Scaling]].\r\n\r\n<strong>See also</strong>\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt>[[http://www.geocities.com/hartke01/|Free
  Font Resources for Free Open Source Operating Systems]]</dt>\r\n<dd>by Stephen G.
  Hartke</dd>\r\n<dt>[[http://www.tug.org/fonts/|Fonts and TeX]]</dt>\r\n<dd>by the
  TeX Users Group</dd>\r\n<dt>[[http://www.openfontlibrary.org/wiki/Existing_Free_Fonts|Existing
  Free Fonts]]</dt>\r\n<dd>on the wiki of the Open Font Library</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n<strong>The
  Utopia license</strong>\r\n\r\nLuxi, IBM Courier, and Adobe Utopia are widely included
  in Linux distributions, but the Debian people feel the licenses are not clearly
  within the DFSG. Utopia was recently re-released by Adobe to the TeX Users Group
  with a [[http://tug.org/fonts/utopia/LICENSE-utopia.txt|clarified license]]. The
  license itself grants TUG the right to freely distribute and modify the font, as
  well as the right to sublicense the font to other parties. TUG has issued a blanket
  statement sublicensing the font to any interested parties. It appears that the question
  regarding the freeness of Utopia has been resolved. [[http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/type/an-update-on-the-status-of-utopia|This
  post]] on Open Source Publishing also comes this conclusion, and includes additional
  clarifications by Adobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Todo</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat about
  Igino Marini's <a href=\"http://www.iginomarini.com/fell.html\">Fell fonts</a>?
  The quality is good, the license is not DFSG compatible in various ways: http://www.iginomarini.com/download.html\r\n"
