body: "My work computer has Times Ten (OpenType) installed. The problem is that in
  Word 2002 (as well as Word Pad) at magnifications of ~150% or less, the text is
  really blocky and bold in comparison with other fonts, regardless of whether it
  is bold or roman. When printed, however, it is crisp and clear. This deviation also
  seems to be affecting some other fonts, but not presets, such as Arial, Times New
  Roman etc. To complicate matters, Photoshop CS3 displays and prints Times Ten fine.\r\n
  \r\nI have:\r\n* Reinstalled Times Ten several times on different computers (with
  both CRT and LCD displays) and Windows operating systems (XP and Vista);\r\n* Turned
  ClearType both on and off;\r\n* Tried Word 2007;\r\n* Read http://typophile.com/node/47525\r\n\r\nDespite
  this, the text remains frustratingly unclear. Surely Times Ten, as a Times-clone,
  should be readable on screen.  \r\n\r\nDoes it affect anyone else?\r\n\r\nEDIT:
  The Times Ten text in the screenshot below is not bold: only the heading is."
