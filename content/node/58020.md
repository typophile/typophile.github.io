  body: "It's hard to say much about the allcaps sans serif (might be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/nexus-sans/|FF
    Nexus Sans]], or a lot of other fonts), but the logo and other serif type looks
    like a Bodoni (pick one). If you are just making faux covers, these should be
    close enough. If you have no budget for fonts, Frutiger or Myriad might be close
    too, assuming you have them on your computers.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
