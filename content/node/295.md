    month since JFP posed the challenge, perhaps he would like to tell us the answer?

    to my questions dated back 24 april? Answer to them, it will help a lot to find
    it.

    about narrowing the geographic field a little from &#34;not east of the Atlantic
    Ocean&#34;?

  body: Also, maybe to narrow the field a just a tiny bit, maybe we should institute
    a rule that the character must appear in the name of the typeface. Any objections?

  body: The name of the file which JFP uploaded is something like &#34;tq.gif&#34;
    And JFP said previously, when I took a guess with Tankard, that it wasn&#39;t
    that side of the Atlantic. Baffled, I am, baffled!

    lovely curves. <BR> <BR>Can I name the glyph, or do you specifically want Kent  <BR>to
    give it? It <i>is</i> quite obvious... ;&#41; <BR> <BR>P.S. When I was still working
    at FontShop and writing  <BR>and designing <i>FontNews</i>, our promotional magazine,
    I  <BR>used to include a Type Quiz in every issue. Would anybody  <BR>mind if
    I posted them here as well, just for laughs?

    <i>doesn&#39;t</i> include the letter Q! So let&#39;s see -- that narrows it down
    quite a bit...to, like, only a million possibilities or so...
