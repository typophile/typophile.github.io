  body: 'Here is a version of Powell done by NovelFonts in 1994 called Powhatten.
    With added stroke thickness I thinks it&#39;s a very good match. Also, for comparison,
    Packard, which had some similar feeling. &#40;Two of the 5 P&#39;s of Antique
    Type that always make me pause: Pabst, Packard, Parsons, Poor Richard and Powell.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I agree, Pabst is not right. Neither is Poor Richard or Parsons. &#40;Or,
    clearly, Packard&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/66409.gif"

  body: does Novel Fonts have a website - where can I get this font

  body: That&#39;s the problem. I cannot find anywhere that still sells these fonts.
    As far as I know NovelFonts is defunct. I was able to find Powhatten on the web
    just now, but we do not like to point out sites with dubious wares for download.
    <BR> <BR>If anyone knows of a source for NovelFonts, I would love to know about
    it, so I can tell others who ask about these fonts. I bought my set in 1994 from
    Tiger Direct as the &#34;Expresiv Fonts Ornate Collection&#34;.

  body: What are the ethics of &#34;sharing&#34; fonts that are not commercially available
    anywhere - but once were? The Fontographer fonts for example, which I believe
    you can&#39;t buy even if you&#39;re a millionaire.  <BR> <BR>Just asking... it&#39;s
    a shame to lose fonts from circulation.

  body: I agree with you about the loss of fonts, and thus I think it becomes a personal
    judgment about making a good faith effort to see if anyone still holds a copyright
    to the font before you decide that a design is &#39;dead&#39; and in need of &#39;revival&#39;.  In
    this case NovelFonts was cautious enough to rename all of their fonts, although
    many, if not all, of them were old designs that were never digitized.  <BR> <BR>But
    I guess those statements were really about when you could revive a design. As
    far as &#39;sharing&#39;, I have always been VERY reluctant to do that, unless
    I believe the font is no longer commercially available, AND the individual I am
    &#39;sharing&#39; it with is someone I know will not be using it commercially
    or selling/distributing it themselves. It&#39;s a slippery slope, so I would rather
    err on the side of conservativism, and avoid the practice altogether.
