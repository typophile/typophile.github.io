body: I have been going nuts trying to locate this body type. Can anyone help me out
  with this? I have included samples including the gothic and italic versions of the
  same font. Any help would be appreciated (I know once I hear the name I will do
  the dufus slap on my forehead).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/axis_5700.jpg]
