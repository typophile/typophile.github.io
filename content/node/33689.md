    anything other manufacturers don't have too, except knowing you have a \"lacie\",
    and nice design, and paying for this. They use the same components, others will
    work just as well.\r\n\r\n100$ for 160gb are quite expensive. Look at the 320gb
    model. It's just 40% more expensive, offering 100% more space."

    hesitant at WD because I had seen cheap models. . . You want to put your money
    into saving your work right. But yea, the TB was considerably more, and it's there
    top of the line. I had a Maxtor 500 gb that went bunk after a few months, only
    thing that ever happened to it was it gettin bumped on my desk. . . It would register
    on my computer (mac) therefore losing 500 gigs worth of music. Ive still got it
    just not sure how to fix it. \r\n\r\nI guess the only thing you should look into
    is the warranty. I never use the software that comes with them. . . I have my

    is still registering, and the bump is the only thing that happened to it, it's
    likely a mechanical failure, and not a media failure. That's fixable / recoverable
    (although perhaps at a price, of course). Have you contacted Maxtor?"

    hard drive is any more reliable than any other brand. They don't make their own
    drives, just the pretty case.\r\n\r\n<strong>they all die.</strong>\r\n\r\nanything
    you have on a hard drive should be backed-up somewhere else \u2013\_I know too
    many people with external hard drives as their main storage, with no back-up of
    that data (do they think the external drive will last forever?)\r\n\r\nSo, presuming
    you have everything backed-up, the one thing that would sway me when I choose
    a hard drive is brand warranty.\r\n\r\nSeagate offer internal 'Barracuda' drives
    with a five-year warranty.\r\nWestern Digital offer the My Book <em>Pro</em> with
    a three-year warranty (other versions of the MyBook range have one-year warranties).\r\n\r\nmost
    other brands offer one-year warranties.\r\n\r\nThese warranties don't stop them
    dying but they will get you a new drive if they do (and if everything is backed-up
    it's not such a problem)\r\n\r\nDid I mention how important it was to back-up

    it doesn't matter what the hard drive is designated as, SCSI, ATA, SATA, FireWire,
    USB, eSATA, it is only the connections that make them what they are, so yes, you
    can house whatever externally with the right connectors.\r\n\r\nI run my internals
    off of a multi port hard drive controller card and use FireWire for externals.
    I use an internal drive as the main system and everything else drive, a second
    as a scratch disk, and a third as a document backup. The externals are all full
    drive back ups, including a portable (OWC Mercury) and a large multi-partitioned
    (for sequential back ups).\r\n\r\nSuperDuper (a cloner) is great for backing up
    everything to the external drives, quickly and reliably, and has saved my butt
    a couple times now.\r\n\r\nThe word of wisdom with a drive is, \"not if, but when\"
    it will fail. And yes, back up your back-ups. Likely, your whole creative, and
