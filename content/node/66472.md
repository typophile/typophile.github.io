  figures \u2013\_there's a few queries I have regarding abbreviated words and small
  caps. Bringhurst isn't comprehensive enough\u2026\r\n\r\nPhD - should this be set
  with a small cap for the P and the D?\r\n\r\nPJ's - this is in dialogue, should
  it still be set with P and J in small caps?\r\n\r\nOK (as in okay) - this is in
  dialogue, should it still be set with O and K in small caps?\r\n\r\nI know a lot
  of this is subjective but it'd be nice to see what others think.\r\n\r\nThanks"
