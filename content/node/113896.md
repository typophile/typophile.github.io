  to create this logo for someone about 6 months ago and have since misplaced the
  font file.\r\nI  do however still have the photoshop file and upon opening it it
  tells me that the font is missing, but that it's name is Motorwerk.\r\nBut the weird
  thing is that a quick google search revealed there is a font called Motorwerk, but
  it looks nothing like this!\r\nI'm at a bit of a loss. Any help would be much appreciated!\r\nMany
  thanks\r\nJames\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SGC-Logo_4499.png]"

  body: "Thank you for your help fvilanakis, I actually just managed to find it and
    it was pretty odd.\r\n\r\nIt is called 'Motorwerk Oblique' (not 'Motorwerk' which
    is a different font). It was a part of a XBOX Live game developers package so
    no wonder it was hard to find! No idea how I came across that originally.\r\n\r\nFont
