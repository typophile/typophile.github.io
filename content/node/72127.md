  from a straight line?\r\n\r\nAlso what is the meaning of such symbols in book text,
  used to seperate paragraphs:\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n.   .   .   .   .   .
  \  .\r\n\r\nI suppose they mark a break/pause in the text..? Can anyone provide
  creative examples which are different from the above.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    of white space between paragraphs, but the first paragraph by chance happens to
    fall at the end of the page so the reader wouldn''t notice the extra pause without
    some additional indication.'
