  for the Chicago Cubs. I have been trying to find the sans serif caps font and brush
  script. I think I have identified the brush script as LaSalle EF but I have had
  no luck with the other font.\r\n\r\nAny help or suggestions would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nuveen6_3419.jpg]"

    about why so often here people in the design business are obviously unable to
    cut out and/or resize the relevant part of a graphic image."

    to crop and resize the image but every time it wouldn't load and would only accept
    this version.\r\n\r\nThanks for your huge help though."
