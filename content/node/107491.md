  body: "Lettering, nothing digital anywhere close to this.\r\nSimplified Fraktur,
    like your sample, was produced in many variations before WW II. A few were made
    into fonts. You might be interested in National by Walter Hoehnisch, 1933-1935:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NationalWalterHoehnisch1933-1935_4786.gif]\r\nConvert
    some the harsh angles into curving brush strokes and you are in the ball park.
    \ \r\nThe war with the Nazis stigmatized these font designs. But time passes and
    there is an increasing appreciation of the the qualities of blackletter fonts.
    Perhaps a digital revival may soon be produced that would have some similarity
    to your image.\r\nDon"
