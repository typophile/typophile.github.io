body: Hello. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been playing around with connecting script. I see already
  that it can be a serious pain in the panini to space these things &#40;getting the
  connections AND the spacing to work&#41;. Anyone have some practical advice for
  the construction phase that would help ease the heartburn in the spacing process?
  <BR> <BR>Seems like maybe you want to do all your spacing at the glyph-shape level
  and set the sidebearings at the connections. Make sense? If so, what should be going
  through my head as I draw up the glyphs &#40;practical checks&#41;?  <BR> <BR>Thanks.
  <BR>Randy

  body: That was just what I needed. It seems like join -&#62; stem is the way to
    go at first &#40;more flexibility for spacing later&#41;. I will post additional
    questions as they come. Thanks! <BR> <BR>Randy <BR>
