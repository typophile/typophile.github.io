body: "I know how to compile OT features from inside a python macro:\r\n\r\nfl.CallCommand(33203)\r\n\r\n33203
  being the code for the menu command OTCompile.\r\n\r\nFontlab also provides codes
  for the menu commands OTFeaturesNew (33222), which resets the features, and OTFeaturesOpen
  (33210), which gets features from a file.\r\n\r\nThe problem with OTFeaturesNew
  (33222) is that it pops an alert asking if you really want to remove all OT data.\r\nThe
  problem with OTFeaturesOpen (33210) is that it pops a dialog to select the file.\r\n\r\nI
  would like to be able to:\r\n\r\n+ reset the OT features WITHOUT popping an alert
  (ie. silently)\r\n+ get features from a specific fea file WITHOUT popping a dialog\r\n\r\nCan
  it be done?\r\n"

  body: "Matthew,\r\n\r\nresetting the features is possible if you don't use the command
    codes, but set the python attributes directly:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nfl.font.features.clean()\r\nfl.font.ot_classes
    = \"\" # to clear the lower right part of the OT panel\r\nfl.UpdateFont()\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nLoading
    feature code from a text file can probably be done, but it would be a bit more
    complicated. In principle, open a text file using python, detect the lines where
    one feature's code starts and ends, and add the feature to the font like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nfl.font.features.append(Feature(myFeatureTag,
    myFeatureCode))\r\nfl.UpdateFont()\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n<pre>\r\nfl.font.features.append(Feature(\"liga\",
    \"feature liga\\n  {\\n  sub f i by f_i;\\n  } liga;\\n\"))\r\nfl.UpdateFont()\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nhth,\r\nJens"

  body: "Maybe I'm missing something, but if you just want your features in an external
    file (which is maybe not the only thing you're wanting to do), you can just put
    something like this at the bottom right pane of the OT panel:\r\n\r\n<pre>include(myfeatures.fea)</pre>\r\n\r\nThe
    .fea file would be in the same directory as the .vfb file in this example."

  body: Good idea. That's simple and works for getting the features into the font.
    But it doesn't display the underyling fea source code in the OT panel, which I
    prefer so I can try different things without having to modify the official features
    file.

  body: "Well, you can easily change things in the external file, save and then hit
    compile in FontLab. It's really only one extra step (saving in the text editor),
    if you don't count switching between programs.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can duplicate
    the external file, and \"include\" that instead, if you want to try different
    things out without messing with your official features file. It also works with
    more than one file (each on a separate \"include\" line), so you can break things
    out logically among multiple .fea files if you wish."
