  So I throw it out to Typophile scrutiny. It's annoyingly familiar, but I'm drawing

    of the K, and the C has only one serif.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks, David. Imprint it is.\r\n\r\nNick, the book was printed in 1956,
    but I suspect it might be photoreproduced from an earlier edition. The gigantic
    spaces at the end of sentences look very odd for 1956. Actually, they look very
    odd for the 20th century!"
