  almost certain this is a cheltenham, but can't find the right one. Any suggestions?
  The closest I found was Cheltenham EF, but its not quite right.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCory"

    I could find nor does it the lesser known <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/gloucester_std_vp/\">Gloucester</a>.
    I think this must be either pre-digital or a clone."

    so it''s part of the brand identity. For the logo, they probably had a designer
    tweak it a little. '

    Similarities are obvious, and proportions match... (taking into account the fact
    the sample is quite small, so I cannot compare it better)
