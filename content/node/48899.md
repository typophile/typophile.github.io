  to Opentype code, which seems to have been a success\u2026so far.\r\n\r\nI would
  love to hear your opinions, and have some feedback and to know if it has any value
  at all. \r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to look.\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Serif-Font-Glyphs_3616.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ligs_5643.jpg]"

  body: "This reminds me a bit of my old Rutager face, though yours is superior to
    that in every way.\r\n\r\nIf I were to pick a flaw, it's that there is a bit too
    much vertical symmetry, leading B, S, and to a lesser extent D and N, to look
    topheavy. Your regular ampersand is a bit light on the bottom too, but your alts
    are lovely, if somewhat large for anything but display use. \r\n\r\nYou have a
    serpentine question mark that actually works! \r\nThat's a fine bunch of ligatures
    you have there too. This is sure to be a hit amongst fans of things like that."

  body: "Cheers, I'm still going strong with the ligatures. I WILL MAKE 100 OF THE
    SUCKERS! Alot of them came about for personal use like names and initials etc.
    I was going to base the name on it\u2026what it will be I have no idea.\r\n\r\nI
    was never really a fan the original ampersand when I made it, but it was a very
    proud day when those two new ampersands turned out as they did.\r\n\r\nI've never
    been a fan of the straight stemmed question mark, so this was my only alternative.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the fast response."

  body: "You asked for critique, you get it:\r\nthe OE-character looks wrong\r\n\r\nAnd
    as an advice... don't push the ligatures. Design some (many!) for combinations,
    where they come naturally, but most of them don't make sense here, if you ask
    me.\r\n\r\n(rather go for the way-to-seldom created gg, gy, ggy, etc.)\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"

  body: "You should post a pdf for better judgment. \r\n\r\nFirst thing I would change
    is \"space\". It's too wide as are \"t\" and \"r\". Lc \"o\" and Uc \"O\" are
    too oval for my taste. Some caps (like \"O\", \"Q\", \"S\", \"T\", \"L\" and then
    some) look too light. Maybe \"S\" and \"s\" should have similar shapes.\r\n\r\nLigatures
    *are* fun, but target your energy at getting the base OK right now."

  body: I find that the widths seem inconsistent. The "u" and "n" for example seem
    to come from a different face than the "o" or "e". The overall nature is narrow,
    so I suggest narrowing the wider forms.
