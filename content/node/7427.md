  body: The high-waisted R and low-waister A remind me of Venus, but the showing of
    the extra bold extended weight in one of my older type sample books omits the
    R and S, so I can&#39;t compare them to this sample. <BR> <BR>Akzidenz Grotesk
    Bold Extended will get you close, although it&#39;s not as heavy as your sample.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Kidding aside, I&#39;ve always been kinda partial
    to Annonce  <BR>Grotesque and have been waiting in vain for a faithful  <BR>rendition
    of the stout bugger. I suspect all of us type nuts  <BR>must have this &#34;want
    list&#34; of as yet undigitized favourites.  <BR>I have the impression that Bigford
    is not the &#34;real thing&#34;.

    alt=""> <BR> <BR>As far as I can remember that font was not called Bigford.. And
    I think it looks too clean compared to the somewhat rough looking sample&#40;s&#41;
    anyway.. I&#39;ll try to find the PSD tomorrow.'

    year, and no longer available Yves <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Franz, maybe you used <a href="http://www.www.Sharkshock.com/fonts/fontsmov2.html"
    target=_top>Reservoir</a>, a very &#34;rough&#34; version of Annonce.

  body: Yes, that&#39;s the one! And it&#39;s a freebie like I seemed to remember.
    I believe the original sample is set in Reservoir as well.
