body: "DeSoto is a family of 4 faces based on a few letters from a 1958 DeSoto magazine
  ad. It's an extended width titling face with a luxurious yet warm feel. Each face
  is fully loaded with features including old style numbers, case-sensitive punctuation,
  alternates and ligatures, fractions, swashes and ornaments, and Central European
  language support. Joe Newton at Veer created the butterflies with ornaments and
  swashes.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DeSoto-butterflies_5206.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CTT0000238_P_5708.gif]"
