  - A Lettering Safari</strong>\r\n\r\nZebramatic is a font for editorial design use,
  to create headlines and titles in eye-catching stripes. Constructed to offer flexible
  and a variety of graphical possibilities, Zebramatic type is easy to use. The font
  is offered in three styles: POW, SLAM and WHAM. These styles work both as ready-made
  fonts and as patterns to create unique, individualized type. The font design\u2019s
  full potential is unleashed by layering glyphs from two or all three styles in different
  colors or shades.\r\nWorking with the different styles I was reminded of the late
  Jackson Pollock poured paintings\u2014in particular the documentation of his painting
  process by Hanz Namuth and Paul Falkernburg in the film Jackson Pollock 51. In Pollock\u2019s
  pictures the complex allure arises from how he layered the poured and dripped paint
  onto the canvas. Similar joyful experience and exciting results emerge by layering
  the different styles of Zebramatic type.\r\n\r\n<strong>Texture</strong>\r\n\r\nIn
  the heart of the Design is Zebramatics unique texture. It is based on an analog
  distorted stripe pattern. The distortion is applied to a grade that makes the pattern
  complex but still consistent and legible. You can view some of the initial stripe
  patterns in the background of examples in the Gallery. Zebramatic POW, SLAM and
  WHAM each offer a distinct pallet of stripes\u2014a unique zebra hide. POW and WHAM
  use different distortions of the same line width. SLAM is cut from a wider pattern
  with thicker stripes. The letter cut and kerning is consistent throughout styles.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zebramatic-JUNGLE-Layering_4542.gif]\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>Design
  Concept</strong>\r\n\r\nAttention-grabbing textured or weathered fonts are ideal
  for headlines, ads, magazines and posters. In these situations rugged individuality,
  letter flow, and outline features are magnified and exposed. Textured fonts also
  immediately raise the design questions of how to create alignment across a word
  and deal with repeated letters.\r\n\r\nZebramatic was conceived as an especially
  flexible font, one that could be used conveniently in a single style or by superimposing,
  interchanging and layering styles to create a unique type. The different styles
  are completely interchangeable (identical metrics and kerning). This architecture
  gives the typographer the freedom to decide which form or forms fit best to the
  specific project.\r\n\r\nAlignment and repetition were special concerns in the design
  process. The striped patterns in Zebramatic are carefully conceived to align horizontally
  but not to match. Matching patterns would create strong letter-pairs that would
  \u201Cstick out\u201D of the word. For example, take the problematic word \u201Cstuff\u201D.
  If Zebramatic aligned alphabetically, the texture of S T and U would align perfectly.
  The repeated F is also a problem. Imagine a headline that says \xBBLOOK HERE\xAB.
  If the letters OO and EE have copied \xBBunique\xAB glyphs - the headline suggests
  mass production, perhaps even that the designer does not care. Some OpenType features
  can work automatically around such disenchanting situations by accessing different
  glyphs from the extended glyph-table. However these automations are also repeated;
  the generated solutions become patterns themselves.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zebramatic-poster-02_4505.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zebramatic-poster-02a_4844.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Flip
  and stack</strong>\r\n\r\nTo master the situation described above, Zebramatic offers
  a different programmatic practice. To eliminate alphabetic alignment, the letters
  in Zebramatic are developed individually. To avoid repetition, the designer can
  flip between the three styles (POW, SLAM, WHAM) providing three choices per glyph.
  Stacking layers in different sequences provides theoretical 27 (3*3*3) unique letterforms.
  A last variable to play with is color (i.e. red, blue, black). Images illustrating
  the layering potential of Zebramatic are provided in the Gallery. \r\nThe design
  is robust and convenient. The font is easily operated through the main font panel
  (vs. the hidden sub-sub-menu for OpenType related features). The process of accessing
  different glyphs is also applicable in programs that do not support OpenType extensively
  (i.e. Word or older Versions of Illustrator).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zebramatic-poster-all-possibilites_5088.jpg]\r\n\r\n<strong>International
  Specs</strong>\r\n\r\nZebramatic is ready for your international typographic safari.
  The font contains an international character set and additional symbols \u2013 useful
  in editorial and graphic design. The font comes in OpenType PostScript flavored
  and TrueType Format.\r\n\r\n<code><a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/harald-geisler/zebramatic/\">\r\nFor
