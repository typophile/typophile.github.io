  feature the German keyboard character layout, for example: \xB0, \xA7, \xB2, \xB3,
  \xE4, \xF6, \xFC, \xDF, \xC4, \xD6, \xDC, \xB5 and \u20AC aren't included. However,
  you managed to insert the missing glyphs yourself by copying the period character.\r\n\r\nThe
  resulting font works just fine in Tux Paint. But it doesn't work in Word - the characters
  are missing, a good rectangle appears instead. What are you doing wrong?"
