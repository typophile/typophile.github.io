  all the varietals of professional fonts available for purchase: Pro, Office, OT,

    mean exactly for .woff/.eot?\r\n\r\nDo you have a link for the original chart?"

  body: 'Put differently: The equations .otf = OT/Pro, .ttf = Offc/OffcPro, .woff/eot
    = Web/WebPro and definitions are FontShop-specific. Different foundries may use
    same or similar terms to mean different things. Or different terms to mean same
    or similar things. There are no standards here. Linotype, for example, has labels
    like Std, Pro, Com, etc for character set plus XSF for hinted TTFs. So the above
    chart is of little use except for shopping FontShop''s FontFont fonts.'

  body: "Exactly. This chart was posted in an article in FontShop\u2019s help section
    under \u2018<a href=\"http://help.fontshop.com/entries/208895-fontfont-opentype-formats-explained\">FontFont
    OpenType Formats Explained</a>\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2018Style-linking not available\u2019
    in this regard means, that the webfonts are not originally style-linked the same
    way Offc FontFonts are style-linked (like grouped under a single item in the font
    menu and the user has to use the key commands and toolbars to switch between Regular,
    Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic.) Style-linking for both WOFF and EOT fonts is of
    course possible, as explained in the <a href=\"http://issuu.com/fontfont/docs/web_fontfont_user_guide\">Web
    FontFont User Guide</a>."
