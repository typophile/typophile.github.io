  body: Jinile, you won&#39;t find one here, unfortunately.  Typophile does not endorse
    the free trading of fonts.  Sorry, but font creators have to make a living like
    everyone else.  You could try checking at free font sites like <a href="http://www.dafont.com"
    target="_blank">DaFont</a> for some alternatives if you&#39;d like.

  body: So if someone is looking for, not a pirated font, but a freeware font, you
    still won&#39;t tell them. Are we only permitted to identify fonts that are not
    free? If Typophile does not endorse freeware fonts, then why did you link to them?
    I&#39;m seriously confused? You&#39;re speaking on behalf of Typophile and saying
    that truly free fonts are forbidden?

  body: Monographeon2, &#39;Serpentine&#39; is not a free font.. <BR>If there is a
    free font out there thats identical to &#39;Serpentine&#39;, its not a legal one..
    <BR>And linking to copies of commercial typefaces is not what Typophile should
    be about.. <BR> <BR><i>And, I think that, if the identified font would actually
    really be a free font, we would sure name it and link it.. So.. If you take a
    closer look at the &#39;Typophile Archives&#39; you may notice that free fonts
    have been identified, named and linked to, before, as well.. Fontalicious, LarabieFonts
    and others..</i>

  body: The name of the forum is the &#34;Type Identification Board&#34;. Jinile has
    already identified his font, he just doesn&#39;t want to pay for it. That&#39;s
    not the same thing as someone who&#39;s looking for a free Circus font &#40;for
    example&#41; in which case he&#39;d be getting lots of suggestions.  <BR> <BR>There
    may well be a freeware font with a similar feel to Serpentine, but I agree it&#39;s
    not the responsibility of this forum to encourage that. I suggest Jinile do the
    legwork himself. Go to Google, type in Free Fonts and you get tons of sites.

  body: <i>&#39;Serpentine&#39; is not a free font.. If there is a free font out there
    thats identical to &#39;Serpentine&#39;, its not a legal one.</i> <BR> <BR>Correct
    me if I&#39;m wrong. I downloaded a Serpentine along time ago, and it was free,
    and I verified it. I could be wrong, but here, again, from a different site, I&#39;ve
    found 1 weight of SerpentineDBol listed as a free font along with 20 other COMMERCIAL
    Serpentine variations. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.highfonts.com/fontsearch.asp?ord=Serpentine&amp;f=0"
    target="_blank">http://www.highfonts.com/fontsearch.asp?ord=Serpentine&amp;f=0</a>
    <BR> <BR>Never say never. <BR> <BR><i>And linking to copies of commercial typefaces
    is not what Typophile should be about..</i> <BR> <BR>Thank you for clarifying
    then, since you obviously misread. No one asked for a pirate of the font to begin
    with. That&#39;s my point. Your sermon is misdirected. I don&#39;t think that
    it&#39;s a crime of nature to use a truly free version of Serpentine, if it is
    in fact free. It may be that &#34;someone needs to make a living&#34;, but whoever
    decided that this version of Serpentine was going to be free seems not to mind.

  body: 'FYI: <BR> <BR>I downloaded the font at the link above and opened it in FontLab.
    It contains the following in the copyright field: <BR> <BR>URW Software, Copyright
    1994 by URW <BR> <BR>Note that this font is also for sale on MyFonts for $19.95:
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/serpentine/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/serpentine/</a>
    <BR> <BR>Whether these are the same URW font or not is hard to say, but it appears
    to be so. A Type 1 version of this font I own has the same copyright information.
    How it came to made available for free on HighFonts.com is also hard to say, but
    I would be surprised if it has URW&#39;s blessing. URW is known for bundling their
    fonts very cheaply &#40;e.g., with FreeHand, clip art collections, etc.&#41;,
    but I have never known them to give them away gratis. <BR> <BR>Just saying.'
