body: I used to watch 'Danger Bay' as a kid in the late 80s and just stumbled upon
  this opening title gem. Does anyone know what calligraphic type this is? It's got
  some similarities to a bunch of chancery typefaces. The show used a drop shadow
  variant but a non-shadow version would do me just fine.

  body: After pouring over scads of chancery typefaces I'm realizing how rare a double
    story _a_ is. Does anyone know the main method that type was made for title screens
    in 80s? Was it photolettering of some kind?
