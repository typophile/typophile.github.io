		<div class="commentbody">I think both Plantin and New Century Schoolbook have versions with infant a&#39;s and g&#39;s. A slab-serif I think would be nice for kids. How about italics? Have you considered using italics? Many typefaces have single-storey g&#39;s for their italics. I&#39;m just thinking, PMN Caecilia italic might be good. Sassoon Primary is an italic sanserif type for teaching handwriting. If you don&#39;t want to use italics, ITC Officina Serif has a single-storey g. For Officina Serif, the g is essentially the same as the Sans counterpart, so there won&#39;t be a problem. What&#39;s wrong with showing kids a double-storey g anyway? I don&#39;t think they&#39;d get confused at all.</div>

Keith suggested slab typefaces, and in fact, almost all of them &#40;Lubalin, Beton, Egyptian 505, etc&#41; have single-storey &#34;g&#34;s.  <BR> <BR>About the &#34;P&#34;, I think I never saw a connecting one. I&#39;m currently developing a typeface for a primary school teacher; it&#39;s a typeface for teaching children to write. In the reference book she showed to me, the &#34;P&#34; is the only non-connected character.  <BR> <BR>About teaching with sans/ living with serifs, I think it will just bring us to another legibility/readability discussion.

		<div class="commentbody">Here are the Ps and gs for Bembo, New Century Schoolbook and Plantin. The Univers g is the type I am looking for. These are all Adobe versions. Do other versions exist with different lowercase Gs? <BR>   Italics would give me the g I&#39;m looking for but I really need the normal roman style. &#40;It&#39;s funny seeing that sans serif  Gs change to double in the italic and serif Gs change to single in italics.&#41; I also noticed that egyptian/slab serifs have the g. Initially I passed the idea up because I wanted something to contrast well with a sans serif . But you&#39;ve made me think about it some more. What if I just used all slab? <BR>   I&#39;ve shown an example with Chaparral MM. Even though I lose style contrast, I could just keep the point sizes far enough apart.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/12285.gif" alt="Univers&#44; Bembo&#44; New Cent&#44; Plantin&#44; Chappy MM"> <BR> <BR>Seagull has a great g, but I need a more &#34;classic&#34; look rather that playful. It is for children, but I need more &#39;normal&#39; letterforms. Something more playful could be fun though. Hmm.. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the input so far, it&#39;s been helpful! <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, the Monotype schoolbook versions are great. I&#39;ll try the Bembo version since its P connects. The &#39;a&#39; was another letter that concerned me but I had given up on that one. It&#39;s good to see that these schoolbook versions also have the &#39;basic&#39; a.  <BR>   I&#39;ve been comparing the gs again for the last few minutes, and I have absolutely no idea what made me think that &#34;sans serif Gs change to double in the italic&#34; and even, for that matter, that &#34;serif Gs change to single&#34;. I don&#39;t have the type book in front of me right now that I was using at the time of my earlier post so I can&#39;t go back just yet and look again to see what made me think that. It was probably just that I was comparing a ton of both serif and sans serif fonts in both their roman and italic forms all at once, and doing it quickly at that. <BR>I just went looking with ATM for an example of either case of the g switching forms, and couldn&#39;t find one, so I must&#39;ve just been going cross-eyed. <BR>Hopefully I didn&#39;t cause you to lose too much sleep wondering what in the world I was talking about. <BR>Again, thanks for the help. Too bad my mistakes are going to get archived, huh? <BR>=&#41; <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">To me, single-storey a&#39;s and g&#39;s in &#39;traditional&#39; seriffed type look a bit strange, especially for revivals like Bembo. They are just not compatible with these early designs. The double-storey a and g are more of a humanist roman thing, where things were written slowly and carefully; the single-storey ones, on the other hand, came from the italic hand which were written a bit faster, without lifting the pen so much. I guess that&#39;s what distinguishes written and printed forms. I wonder if showing traditional seriffed faces like Bembo to kids with single-storey &#40;schoolbook&#41; forms might confuse them? I don&#39;t know...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It&#39;s Monday, and I have my type book back now. I wasn&#39;t completely going crazy.. perhaps only partially.. <BR>Here are serif faces that switch from double to single story g when going from roman to italic: <BR>Bernhard Modern <BR>Christiana <BR>ITC Clearface <BR>Corona <BR>ITC Cushing <BR>&#40;but still no examples, as HHP wrote, for sans serifs&#41; <BR>There&#39;s probably more, but at the moment I don&#39;t have time to check them all. &#40;Notice those are B-C.&#41; <BR>KT, good points. For example, &#34;ea&#34; is a common letter formation, and the two together are a bit forced. I&#39;m not sure it would confuse them, but it does look awkward.</div>
