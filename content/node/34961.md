body: "Hey everyone, at the risk of ridicule and being thought a madman, I was trolling
  a UFO site and came across some documents. These represent script from a supposed
  extra-terrestrial craft the government is in possession of. I have seen the main
  \"alien\" type someplace, but it has been more than a few years ago. It looks like
  a faux kanji or some other fake script. \r\n\r\nhttp://isaaccaret.fortunecity.com/pacl-lang-analysis-p119-fullsize.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
  is one of the better pages, but there are several at:\r\n\r\nhttp://isaaccaret.fortunecity.com\r\n\r\nI
  am currently looking through my library and will update if I find it.\r\n\r\n-Mike\r\n\r\nUPDATE:
  It looks like flipped Katakana i.e. Matrix rain... there are a few pics online...
  I actually am going to link a new image.\r\n(rotated 180\xB0)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Alienscript_5975.jpg]\r\n\r\nand
  the matrix-esque sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MatrixCodeCloseUp_4308.jpg]\r\n\r\nFrom
  the wikipedia... thanks."

  body: Hey, Mike, I think that instead of the typeface sample, the JPEG that got
    uploaded is the Fortune City logo.

  body: "The FortuneCity logo is what appears when you try to hotlink an image from
    them. If you go to the site and click on page 119 on the right hand side, you
    can see the image. You might have to reload it if you clicked on the hotlink already.\r\n\r\n

    Katakana.

  body: I can see some flipped numbers in the faux-Matrix image -- 36. Then there
    are unflipped numerals, like 1 and 74...
