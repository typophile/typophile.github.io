body: "The attachment is a scanned page from the book \"Arithmetic Geometry\", edited
  by Silverman and Cornell. It is by far the nicest font for math books I've ever
  seen. However, I cannot identify this font. \r\n\r\nSome quick facts:\r\nThe book
  was published in 1986, quite possible that it was typeset by LaTeX. \r\nThe font
  supports math symbols.\r\n*The upright g has two o, like the one shown here.\r\n*The
  italic letter for <em>g</em> has only one o, not two o, like the hand-written one.\r\nThe
  font looks like times new roman, but is slightly thicker, bolder.\r\nThe font also
  resembles georgia, but it is not. I closely examined letter a in both fonts and
  they are not the same.\r\n\r\nPlease help me identify this font. Thanks a lot.\r\n"

    the paper it's printed on?"

  body: It looks like a Times variant, which isn't surprising as Springer sets most
    of its math in Times.  There are various latex math fonts designed to blend with
    Times, (e.g. the commonly bundled mathptmx package or the MTPro2 font set).
