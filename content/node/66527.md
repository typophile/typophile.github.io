body: "I'm getting interested in Thai fonts now, and would like to look at some specimen
  books. I've already found \u0E41\u0E1A\u0E1A\u0E15\u0E31\u0E27\u0E1E\u0E34\u0E21\u0E1E\u0E4C\u0E44\u0E17\u0E22
  (Thai Fonts) in digital form (<a href=\"http://ftp.opentle.org/pub/national-fonts/FONTBOOK.PDF\">PDF</a>)
  and am wondering if there's any place I can get it in paper form before printing
  it out myself. I'm also aware of <a href=\"http://linux.thai.net/~thep/\">Theppitak
  Karoonboonyanan</a>'s work maintaining the NECTEC fonts for Linux.\r\n\r\nBut what
  I'm <em>really</em> interested in is older, pre-digital specimens of high-quality
  Thai printing.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI have one gem already in my collection, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=KoZB2IN96ccC\">D\xE9buts
  de l'imprimerie en France: L'Imprimerie nationale. L'H\xF4tel de Rohan</a> (see
  p. 160 for the \"Siamois\"). I have some other lower quality samples, like a book
  on printing \"Foreign Languages\" from the US Government Printing Office, but what
  I'm looking for is the good stuff, quality metal from the pre-digital era. Specimen
  books or just well-printed books are all welcome -- I want to do my <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/31349\">averaging
  trick</a> on the smaller sizes of text, and I am in particular interested in optical
  sizes for Thai, as I think those small loops and curlicues could be more robust
  in smaller sizes and smaller and more refined in larger.\r\n\r\nExamples of excellent
  calligraphy and penmanship are also most welcome.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly
  appreciated!"

  body: "I would love guides to finding similar information, i.e., pre-digital specimens
    of high-quality printing, examples of excellent calligraphy and penmanship, not
    just for Thai but other writing systems. I say this because I just had this thought
    looking at Xavier Dupr\xE9's Khmer typefaces the other day, and wondered if I
    should just go find well-printed Khmer books in the library and look at them,
    even though I don't read Khmer.\r\n\r\nI don't imagine I would ever be able to
    design Khmer letters (I need only to think of all the things non-natives would
    get wrong trying to design letters in the Korean alphabet), and would be sceptical
    about the attempts of non-natives, but your averaging trick sounds promising.
    If one is to design a successful typeface in a writing system one doesn't read
    natively, your approach is the way to go about it, I think: fresh and well-thought-out
    revivals of pre-digital quality type.\r\n\r\nSome sort of convenient repository
    of \"quality type and lettering samples\" for different writing systems would
    be nice. Maybe a job for the TypoWiki?"

    not even try deciphering Thai handwriting before, so different they seemed from
    the printed forms.

  body: Yes, unfortunately I had to learn the hard way (living there for several years);
    still I wouldn't be confident enough to design a Thai font, although I can write
    Thai. I have only experience of what I've seen, not an appreciation of the historical
    derivations of the letters (which would help explain the differences between print
    and handwriting). Approaching type design purely as a linguist not so likely to
    be successful. Still, it's fascinating ;)

    The other reputedly illiterate type maker I know of is the Indian punchcutter
    Ranoji Raoji Aru (1848-1922).
