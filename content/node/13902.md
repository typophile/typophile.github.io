  body: "David,\r\nif you care even a little tiny bit about type, you will purchase
    the original, correct font: Rotis Serif by Otl Aicher. There are certainly plenty
    of \"clones\" \u2014 actually, the word is \"rip-offs\" \u2014 of this typeface
    around, and there are also plenty of similar fonts. \r\n\r\nBut, if you have any
    concern for type at all you will spend the measly $21 to buy the real typeface.
    Especially if you are doing a job for <strong>Citistreet</strong>, and require
    the typeface to do the job. And especially if you are being paid to do this job.\r\n\r\nWith
    overbrimming frustration,\r\nchester, a type designer"

  body: Chester, for your information, I >did< purchase Rotis Serif, from MyFonts.com,
    within 10 minutes of reading the post identifying the face. $21.00 is not the
    point. After purchasing the font, I simply asked if there were other similar fonts
    available - for my edification - and to attempt to ensure that I provide the correct
    match for my client. As you obviously understand, in this world of font "rip-offs",
    it is difficult to know, without close visual inspection, which face was actually
    used. Your presumption that I wanted to avoid paying the original designer for
    his work is entirely off the mark, and reflects poorly on your view of the world.

  body: "I think \"clone\" must have thrown Chester off.\r\n\r\nI know of one rip-off
    of Rotis (although it's a derivative, not a clone), and in fact it's marketed
    by a major font house.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Mr Anderson, I owe you an apology for jumping to conclusions. I'm sorry that
    I accused you of \"grubbing\" for a Rotis-alike. I felt that the identification
    of Rotis was so obviously correct that the case was closed. I haven't seen a contemporary
    use of Rotis (especially Serif) for a few years, but the fonts were pretty much
    ubiquitous in the early 90s, so I assumed that not recognising it was an oversight.
    Like it would be impossible to not recognise the plaintive proto-emo musical strains
    of \"Pale Shelter\" as being Tears For Fears. Again, my apologies. My view of
    the world is somewhat murky these days; battling against pirates and identity
    thieves'll do that to a guy...\r\nc"
