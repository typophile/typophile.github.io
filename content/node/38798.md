  class our assignment is to do two variations of a poster with type only.  Anything
  goes on it for the most part except for the use of imagery.  However; we have to
  have a two page paper along with it over the typeface we choose, and it has to be
  single spaced.  i want to do a modern, sans serifed type of some sort.  But, i cannot
  find enough information over any of the ones i choose and I'm running our of choices.
  \r\n\r\nPlease suggest a sans serifed, modern font that has enough information on
  it. maybe i am just searching wrong, but i cannot find a source with enough info,
  so please tell me where i can get the amount of info i need. thanks a lot in advance."

  body: "What guidelines have you been given regarding the content of your paper?
    \ I can imagine such a paper possibly including:\r\n\r\n* a discussion of the
    development of the typeface\r\n* comments from the typeface's designer\r\n* reactions
    from people other than the designer, both praise and criticism\r\n* a discussion
    of uses to which the font has historically been put; are there usage trends associated
    with the font (was it extremely popular in, say, the 1970s? has it been growing
    in popularity since its introduction? etc.)?  Are there particularly famous (or
    infamous) applications of the font?\r\n* an analysis of the font's characteristics\r\n*
    personal reflections on the font: why you chose it (though if you really chose
    it because there is a lot of \"information on it,\" you should come up with some
    other explanation); how it supports or detracts from the idea your poster is trying
    to convey; etc.\r\n\r\nWhat does your instructor want you to get out of this assignment?
    \ What do you want to get out of the assignment?\r\n\r\nIf what you really want
    is a sans serif font with a substantial literature, I'd try Optima, Helvetica,
    or Futura (disclaimer: with the exception of Zapf's book <em>About Alphabets</em>,
    I don't know what info is out there regarding any of these fonts.  If, however,
    you ever need to write a paper on indigenous language dictionaries, let me know
    and I'll send you a decent bibliography).  But maybe a more satisfying approach
    to this assignment would be to choose a font (or a handful of fonts) that would
    work well for your poster and ask for help finding resources related to that font/those
    fonts.\r\n\r\nEither way, good luck with your project."

  body: "thanks for that information, aric. as far as guidelines, really there are
    none.  To provide just a little background, this is a new professor and he really
    doesn't have his act together.  all of our assignments have been fairly vague,
    mostly useless, and he has not really sat down to teach us as a class; and we
    have yet to have a critique on any of our projects.  \r\n\r\nbasically, our assignment
    is just to do 2 posters- one B/W and one color.  all the poster really needs to
    say is the name of the font and show what most of the characters would look like
    (at least the alphabet). but, it can be laid out in any way we choose; something
    that would compliment the font.  i think i won't have any problem with this using
    a sans serifed font.\r\n\r\ni do really like Helvetica, in fact it's one of my
    favs, but someone has already chosen it, and was able to find easily a lot of
    information. i think i will look into optima. i will check the school library
    for Zapf's book About Alphabets. \r\n\r\nwhat do you mean by indigenous language
    dictionaries? i'm not sure if that's something i need to write about or not. \r\n\r\nas
    far as choosing a font that would work well for my poster, and then worrying about
    the resources, i'm not too worried about that. i have several ideas that i can
    work with as long as it is a sans serifed font. something bolder or thicker would
    be best.  everything i have tried so far has not had enough information on it.
    i'm sure it does somewhere as i know alot of these typefaces were modern before
    computers were around and are based off of pre-existing fonts.  i say all that
    to say, whatever font i can get, i think i will be able to work with it to design
    something nice and would still be able to state a personal reason on choosing
    that font rather then just the reason that there was enough info.\r\n\r\nthanks
    for the help so far!\r\n\r\n::edit:: and by the way, if neither of those two suggested
    fonts do work out(and this is for anyone else with suggestions), we are able to
    use any font from any designer or type foundry. although, i really would have
    thought that the type foundries would have more background on their fonts. "

  body: "Bryce Thorne, that was just ironic sort of Morissette's \"like rain on your
    wedding day.\" Morissette also said that information cannot be designed; what
    can be designed are the modes of transfer and the representations of information.
    This is inherent in the nature of information, and it is important for designers
    to keep the concepts of information and meaning distinct.\r\nI've done a similar

    with my students, see if it helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'i see what you''re saying. those posters are for the most part the same sort
    of project we are doing, however instead of the definitions and history of the
    font being included on the poster, they must be included in a paper. those give
    me some ideas for mine and some are similar to ideas i already had so thank you.
    i do like Optima; if i can find enough material over it i will use it. '

    unless you change your major, or have a penchant for, say, Navajo.\r\n\r\n<em>something
    bolder or thicker would be best</em>\r\n\r\nIn that case you might also look at
    Gill Sans.\r\n\r\n<em>i do like Optima; if i can find enough material over it
    i will use it.</em>\r\n\r\nOptima is a very popular font.  If you look around
    your environment, I'm sure you'll see examples of it all over. I've recently noticed
    it on a Listerine bottle, a calendar, and a book cover.\r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima|Wikipedia's
    article on Optima]] has a list of print and web resources that may help you get
    started.  (It probably goes without saying that Wikipedia has similar lists for
    many other typefaces.)  As with all research, whenever you read an academic article/book/etc.,
    be sure to read the bibliography and look up any of their sources that may pertain
    to your topic."
