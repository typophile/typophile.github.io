  same question there]]; \"The fiends at typophile.com would help you greatly on this\",
  I hope he's right and will really appreciate any help. Here's the full submission
  copy & pasted:\r\n\r\nBackground info:\r\n\r\nI should first point out that this
  isn't any part of any essay - just an introduction to the development of my project.
  Grammatically it probably has plenty of errors; I'm not too worried about this,
  but feel free to go Grammar-Nazi on my ass if you wish.\r\nIt's probably worth mentioning
  that I'm in the UK, where patenting a typeface is different to the US. Also, College
  and Uni are different things - I'm not currently at a University standard of working.\r\nAny
  help, corrections or opinions are greatly appreciated.\r\nSources:\r\n- [[http://www.gillhams.com/articles/352.cfm|Info
  on UK typeface patenting]]\r\n- [[http://books.youworkforthem.com/book/P0022/Dolly|Fayherbe
  / De Vringer's Dolly Catalogue]]\r\n- General knowledge about piracy.\r\n\r\nWrite-up:\r\n\r\nTypeface
  piracy is so common that it\u2019s almost expected, and knock-off typefaces are
  very common amongst more popular fonts. To prevent knock-offs the designer has to
  legally copyright their typeface, and to do this they would have to patent and sell
  each character of the typeface separately; at about \xA360 per registration and
  a typeface usually having at the very least 26 characters, this could cost as much
  as \xA31,560 to copyright a typeface of only uppercase or lowercase characters \u2013
  no punctuation or numbers included. When piracy is so common and easy to get away
  with anyway, spending this much to prevent knock-offs is quite likely not worth
  it.\r\n\r\nI think that trying to put a stop to piracy is a losing battle \u2013
  not only in the design industry, but in the music, film, software and gaming industries
  too. In an attempt to lessen the effects of piracy in these industries companies
  usually try to punish those pirating but it usually has little to no impact on the
  pirates, and instead makes things difficult for honest customers \u2013 in turn
  potentially turning them to pirating too. This is done through things like increasing
  prices to make up for lost sales, putting anti-piracy ads which can\u2019t be skipped
  before legal DVD\u2019s, tethering content to an online account so that it can only
  be accessed as long as an internet connection is maintained, and many other tactics.
  I think that I can learn from the mistakes that I see in these actions in other
  industries; these are all attempts at discouraging piracy; I think that instead
  these industries have to adapt, and to encourage the more ethical option.\r\n\r\nThe
  biggest problem and influence on piracy is that everything being stolen is easily
  copied, and therefore seems value-less. I guess a pretty obvious starting point
  would be to go back to physical work \u2013 which brings me back to the idea I had
  while looking at dolly\u2019s catalogue by Fayherbe / De Vringer \u2013 giving the
  client what would effectively be a physical copy of the typeface as well as a digital
  copy (which would be sent via email and also come attached to the physical copy
  somehow). This way you\u2019re rewarding honest customers and making the ethical
  option a lot more tempting. I\u2019ll look into ways to give the client a physical
  copy of the typeface later, but I already have some basic ideas after looking at
  Fayherbe / De Vringer\u2019s work.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for any help!"

    \ A copy on a CD?  I don't think that would be much of an incentive for the customer."

    seem valueless to those who pay for them. \r\n\r\nIt's not especially productive
    to look at piracy as this absolute moral wrong to be eradicated. More accurately,
    piracy is a cost of doing business. If you cast your eye around the font industry,
    you'll notice that just about everyone chooses to keep selling fonts despite the
    costs of piracy.\r\n\r\nPut it another way: if your thesis fails to explain observable
    reality, there's a flaw in your thesis. "

    I agree that it isn't productive to view piracy as a moral wrong <em>to be eradicated</em>
    -- since such a view may result in devoting time and resources to attempting such
    eradication that will end up doing more damage to one\u2019s livelihood than the
    piracy --, the fact of piracy as a cost of doing business doesn\u2019t mean that
    it isn\u2019t a moral wrong. The pragmatic if reluctant acceptance of a certain
    level of piracy shouldn\u2019t be taken as endorsement. There is no case of \u2018They
    didn't stop me, so it must be okay\u2019."

  body: "I agree with Matthew.\r\nThe scenario you have described doesn't correspond
    with the reality of being in the font industry, which is supported by people who
    pay to licence fonts as a matter of course. \r\n\r\nI don't think fonts can be
    meaningfully compared with other digital products such as music, film, etc.\r\nFonts
    are not a consumer product but a business expense, and businesses are less inclined
    to cheat than teenagers seeking entertainment.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the putative
    impediments of piracy, plagiarism, freeware and bundling have been a condition
    of the digital font industry since it began, and a background against which it
    has managed to thrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>have been a condition of the digital font industry since it
    began, and a background against which it has managed to thrive.</cite>\r\n\r\nYes.
    \"Thrive\" being the key word. I've been hearing about the scourge of piracy since
    I entered the font industry nearly 20 years ago. Yet everyone in the font industry
    seems better off than they were then. There are more people making fonts, and
    more people making money off fonts. \r\n\r\nIs there any designer who'd prefer
    to work in the font industry of 1991 rather than 2011? Even if I made the 1991
    version magically piracy-free? I doubt it. \r\n\r\nTo go back to the OP, you're
    painting with an overly broad brush. If anything, the font industry has adapted
    better to the era of digital distribution than other industries. Perhaps a more
    interesting avenue of inquiry is why that has been true. Maybe other industries
    should be taking lessons from the font industry, rather than vice versa.\r\n\r\nI
    would also encourage you not to get mired in the law of font copyrights. Those
    laws vary widely among jurisdictions, and in the end don't have a huge bearing
    on how the font industry operates. "

    also important to note that many of the people using fonts are genuinely people
    who never have used them or would have purchased them. I used to know a guy whose
    three-story townhouse was wall-to-wall shelves of burned DVDs more movies, music,
    and games than he could experience in a lifetime. Like him, plenty of pirates
    are just geeks who hoard pirated content as a hobby. That has a real impact on
    the film, music, and game industries, because geeks who hoard content used to
    be their best customers. But geeks who download font giga-torrents just for the
    hell of it weren't buying fonts before, and they won't buy them in the future."
