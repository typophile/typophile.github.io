body: Does anyone know what this musical symbol is called? It is part of Sonata, and
  Musical Symbols. I've been up and down the web and bought a book on musical symbols
  but it's just ain't there![img:sites/default/files/old-images/SIGN_4811.jpg]

  body: "Most dynamic/tempo instructions are horizontal (don't want to increase vertical
    spacing between staves), that leads me to think it ought to be some key/time signature
    symbol.\r\n\r\nMaybe some form of tablature rather than traditional notation,
    or maybe even a form of dance notation. What about non-western?\r\n\r\nNot very
    helpful I know, but it's not very well drawn, is it?"

  body: In the font called Sonata, it is referred to as 'serpent', although in many
    years as a musician, I haven't run into it. Looks nice.
