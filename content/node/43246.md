  samples in extensively (and well-) kerned serif/text fonts, in pdf form I'm assuming.
  (I'm not interested in buying or pirating the font, I just want to see it.) The
  letters t, i, o, s, and r, and their combinations with other letters in particular
  are causing brain fry. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    in a number of serif fonts, print these out, and look at how these fonts handle
    kerning.\r\n\r\nI like using the BBC website for \"real\" texts, since they have
    articles in a lot of languages.\r\n\r\nI don't know what your font looks like,
    but some good fonts to compare come with Adobe products, like Minion, Garamond
    Premiere, Arno, etc.\r\n\r\nThen print out the same texts set in your font, and
    see what the color differences are."

  body: "I have been using a strategy similar to what Dan recommends.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I have questions about letter combinations, I have additional windows open and
    check the same combinations in other fonts, and see how they were kerned in those
    fonts. Different fonts have different strategies for kerning, so you want those
    that are as similar as possible for comparison. \r\n\r\nOne thing is to match
    the x-height and style (old style serif, humanist sans, etc). Another issue is
    the approach to kerning. In Minion practically everything seems to be kerned--an
    effort to be as tight as possible without being cramped, I think--whereas Adobe
    Garamond is much more selective. If you look at a number of fonts, and narrow
    it down to two or three, and check those for the combinations in question, you
    will get a sense of what you want to do. In some cases your decisions may be a
    bit different than your models, based on your font's style and your own feeling
    for the look you want. "
