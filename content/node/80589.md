  condensed version, and something that could pass for a tech-savvy, minimal, and
  maybe even fashionable tone.\r\n\r\nThink: Vogue meets 2001: A Space Odyssey\r\n\r\nSuggestions?"

  body: "That was in the right neughbourhood. But after posting this I found out that
    Klavika has a condensed version (how did I not know that?), which makes it ideal
    for what I was trying to do.\r\n\r\nThe application requires a lot of digrammatic
    work in a design-conscious setting, so I wanted a condensed that wouldn't lose
    the \"feel\" of the primary typeface. "
