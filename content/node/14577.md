  moment. It's almost a pro bono job, but I want to be able to show it off later.
  The guys produce a variety of TV shows and films (not a broadcasting company, just
  direction and filming). They work from UK (this is why Gill Sans looks so well for
  them) :)\r\nI was trying to play with \"alliance\" and stumbled over the Nebulae
  typeface. I've modified it a bit to achieve a less detailed pattern. I've also tried
  a more abstract \"circle\" instead of a \"B\".\r\nAnyway.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate
  any comments from the board.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlexey"

  body: I really like the text style in the second examples of both files, however
    I think if you got with the "B" logo you should shrink it down a bit, and likewise
    with the text second in the baltid_5.gif file example. I'm not too sure which
    logo I prefer to be honest... good job either way though!

    so that it has a more unique feel to it."

    businesses are pretty different, an id should stay unique enough. The problem
    is one of the clients doesn't like it. He wants something very simple, even if
    it is generic and abstract. :/\r\n\r\nSo, Gill Sans you say..."

  body: 'Personally I prefer option 4. The B''s in the first two options look distorted
    due to how they are made up, this gives a slight unfinished  impression (maybe
    a very (very) light blue plain background B behind the ahem wiggly bits may help?).
    Fontwise Gill Sans looks far better.. it''s also pretty timeless, the other font
    option would date quite fast I would think. '

    Maybe you could work some of that into the logo. <strong>Good</strong> Gill Sans
    (like the new release) looks so sweet!

    typeface.\r\n\r\nSince the whole point of having a visual mark, is\r\nto eventually
    have the mark stand alone and have it\r\nresonate with the audience, I'll address
    this:\r\n\r\nWhile the ideas seem interesting, can you come up\r\nwith some additional
    concepts involving solid forms?\r\n\r\nGeometric and abstract may seem \"boring\"
    but it\r\nreally isn't -- the results of simplicity, uniqueness,\r\nand memorability
    derive well from such formalities.\r\n\r\nThe lessons from Modernism would be
    very appropriate\r\nfor a company such as this."

  body: "Hello again,\r\n\r\nafter reading the last comment I've felt myself confused,
    as I hadn't really understood which part of the modernism you, caboume, were referring
    to. I did try to see some examples, but the only reference I have at the moment
    is \"The Shock of The New\" which is quite a good reading, but has nothing to
    do with graphic design. Paul Rand's \"Designer's Art\" inspired me a bit.\r\n\r\nAnd
    here is what I've done so far. I've started with form 1. And am actually tweeking
    it for the last three days without any success I could be proud of. I need some
    more insights and your comments, if you  please.\r\n\r\nGone catching on with

  body: "I still like the Gill... \r\n\r\nI was wondering about making a Gill like
    B ( or a BAtv or whatever) made not with squiggles but with rounded sea stones.
    I saw a logo made with leaves that I thought was pretty strong in eye magazine
    once.\r\n\r\nAbout the abstract stuff - clearly you have the main idea about this
    formal style - but I don't see what idea is being driven at. What are these marks
    saying? The best of these marks have a message that they are attempting to distill
    I think. Adopting the style is not enough.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't sound like this client
    has told you much about what they want other than they want something simple.
    If you can't get more out of them then I think you have to suggest what you think
    they should have - you have to invent a meaning for the logo. Am I right about
    this client or reading into the thread too far?\r\n\r\nIf you are totally stuck
    you could just suggest a 'word mark'. What could be wrong with that?\r\n\r\n"

    of \"Ba\" or \"ba\". Which is so much abstract that it doesn't read it, but probably
    hints on the idea of some kind of [distant] alliance. Which it apparently does
    not either, as I see from your comment.\r\n\r\nA wordmark could also be a variant,
    though I do tend to have some kind of icon to be able to use separately as well.\r\n\r\nNo,
    the client haven't left a lot of comments to base my research on. :/"

  body: "Now that you explain it I see it. But I think it's too hard to see. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    Why 'Ba' as opposed to bal or balt or just b?\r\n\r\nJust 'b' seems the simplest
    and the most in keeping with reductionist modernism. You could have a tall ascender
    rectangle & a circle. Done.\r\n\r\nYou could also play with it ...  & have a ball
    maybe with a silly highlight & shadow & then 'tic'. Get it? \r\n\r\nI would like
    to know why they chose that name. It seems odd. On the other hand isn't there
    a food store in England called Iceland? Actually that almost makes more sense.
    Iceland could refer to frozen food.\r\n\r\nIf you knew why they chose baltic that
    might be a route to a good fit in the design.\r\n\r\nI just checked out your site
    \r\n\r\nhttp://www.xtati.com/\r\n\r\nNice stuff!"

    is way nicer to set... It should be still clear, though, that it is Baltic Alliance

    it this is because many screens do not represent white very well or are not correctly
    white-balanced and/or that a white screen is uncomfortable/jarring to look at,
    take your pick or add another), so if this is to be used as a screen id it is
    worth examining it reversed out of a colour(s) and to employ an animated form
    of the abstract shapes (or maybe play with outlines of the Baltic states) that
    you used in version 2 to form a B or a circle, which, despite the associations
    to Unilever, I prefer. You can then develop this for a print logo.\r\nTim"
