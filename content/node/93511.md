body: "Hey everyone, I'm new to this awesome forum. I was wondering if I could get
  some of you experts in typography to help give some input on my poster series. I'm
  creating posters that deal with typography and some basic tips for beginners. Right
  now I have 8 posters and will maybe make a ninth if I need it. I was hoping that
  everyone could give me some input on the topics I chose to write about.\r\n\r\n1.
  Choose the right typeface for the job.\r\n2. Serif or Sans Serif?\r\n3. Kern correctly.\r\n4.
  Use two fonts on average in a design.\r\n5. The grid.\r\n6. Weights.\r\n7. Hierarchy.\r\n8.
  Use fonts that have complete sets of glyphs.\r\n\r\nSo those were the topics I chose
  to put. I'm going for a real minimalist poster and  I already have some examples
  if you would want to see them.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone."

  body: "A question: What is the intended purpose of this poster series?  You say
    that it's a series of tips, but your example isn't a tip - it's a 'what you should
    be thinking about'/\r\n\r\nIf it were the opening slide of an extended power-point
    presentation, fine. But if it's a stand-alone reminder, I don't think that your
    example really says very much. \r\n\r\nIt's as if your topic were 'getting ready
    to face the day' and a  poster said:\r\n Choose your clothing appropriate to your
    day\r\n\r\nThe content  is dull, and neither gives any hint of why or  how, and
    has little educational or entertainment value. For this topic in particular, why
    is the typeface you chose appropriate for the poster? Maybe the same phrase in
    two different typefaces, one next to or over the other, might bring the point
    across. Possibly an almost illegible display font as a contrast."

    body: "Thanks for the reply, it all helps! I understand completely what you're
      saying. The only thing is that I would say that since my poster is telling you
      to think about your choice of typeface, it would be a tip.\r\n\r\nAnyway, your
      suggestion about using illegible typefaces to show contrast is really good,
      the only thing I would have to say is that in the format it's at right now,
      adding things like that seems to me as if they would add unwanted noise to the
      design. So, would you suggest, to scrap the layout of these posters and redesign
      it? Or should I try to incorporate it into the design?\r\n\r\nLastly, I'll try
      to get a kerning example that's another one of my posters.\r\n\r\nEdit\r\n\r\nSo
      I finished the next example. Anyway I think this one has a more interesting
      concept since it shows a bad example of kerning and then some text that is kerned
      much better.\r\n\r\nSorry again for the image width....\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TypographyMatters_4917.png]"

    between the type and the arrow/half hexagon.

    body: Sorry for not being clearer. Usually, you want to limit yourself to 2 (maybe
      3) typefaces. After that, the design will start to get distracting.

    It may be decent advice for a non-designer trying to lay out a simple document,
    but I know you could easily come up with dozens, if not hundreds, of contexts
    in which that advice would be counterproductive.

    body: Thanks for the reply, and I'm sorry I haven't checked back here in a while.
      Anyway, I do get what you mean so I guess I won't use that piece of advice since
      it doesn't span over typography in general enough.
