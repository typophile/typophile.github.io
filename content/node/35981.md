  body: Has the same thickness and look. Springfield was the closest I could find,
    but I am unhappy with that.

  body: "In typositor there was a font called Elizabethian. It was Belwe without the
    extra fancy serifs on the letters... I don't know if anyone has ever digitized
    it. Springfield btw reminds me very much of Seagull. And if you are looking in
    that direction, you could probably go with Musketeer...\r\n\r\nYou may want to
    consider Windsor - which means if you are going for something with \"display qualities
    of Belwe\" you may want to try Valley Forge."
