  about time I started to get some feedback on it.  The most obvious issue is with
  the weight of the &#39;b,d,p,q&#39; in the lower case. There are other problems
  with the &#39;a,c,e,g&#39; that I am working on. Any advice or criticism is welcome.

  body: 'I think it&#39;s a good project; there&#39;s a certain &#39;genericity&#39;
    in certain characters &#40;BPRf, for example&#41; but I guess it&#39;s just a
    matter of tweaking the curves, etc. There&#39;s a lot of inconsistencies in color
    &#40;weight&#41;; and overall it seems a bit too light &#40;specially the thins&#41;.
    You&#39;re right about the bdpq. The bowls need more weight. <BR> <BR>Other comments:
    <BR>- O: the inner shape looks &#39;squarish&#39;; <BR>- Q: tail is too odd and
    thin; <BR>- W: that white shape in the middle &#40;where the two strokes cross
    each other&#41; is too small, enlarge it or remove it; <BR>- X: top heavy; <BR>-
    g: extremely odd shape for this typeface; <BR>- y: it needs the inner left serif
    &#40;IMHO&#41;.'

  body: Leigh, <BR>You have to decide if you are going to make a great contrast between
    thick and thin like your o, c, e, or not so much like your h, m, n. <BR>Also,
    the weight of the vertical straights is wider in feel than the curves &#40;the
    stem of the b, d, p, q&#41; versus the adjacent curves

  body: Thanks everyone. I have a bit of work to do. It is good to get a lot of the
    problem areas acknowledged in writing. There was even a few there that I was not
    aware of.  <BR> <BR>The grand plan is for the family to include a Katakana, Hiragana
    and Arabic character set. I have a contact for the Arabic development of the typeface,
    but I have been unable to locate any Japanese typographers willing to offer some
    feedback. If anyone has any leads, I would really appreciate it.  <BR> <BR>&#42;L&#42;
