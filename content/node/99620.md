  Today though, I'm just glad to have internet.\r\n\r\nI own a business, changing
  directions and looking at going into the nonprofit sector.   I'm designing (by necessity)
  my own new logo.  I've pieced together a sillhouette image that I think I want to
  use, but an important part of the image might be too small.   \r\nMy main question
  is, how to position the lettering? Is it ok to have the company name and website
  floating off to the side like this?  Any constructive criticism is welcome!\r\nAlso,
  I want the font to be clean and modern, \"respectable\", yet have some character.
  \ This font is called \"Cicle.\"  Oh, and the lower one is Calibri. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/good

  body: "[Non-designer, non-professional opinion follows]\r\n\r\nI think that the
    text, no matter what the font, is too small relative to the overall size of the
    composition.  A better balance between the size of the tree and the size of the
    text should be aimed for. Because the main text is adjacent to the widest part
    of the tree, it looks squeezed in and almost pushed off the page. Rasing it up
    about halfway to the top would give it more room and allow it to be bigger (unless
    you're ok with splitting the name into two or more lines)\r\n\r\nThe url could
    be completely separated from the name - placing it closer to the ground would
    also improve the overall balance.\r\n\r\nAs to the font(s) themselves, have you
    considered how the logo will look next to whatever font(s) you want to use for
    your webpages, snail-mail letters, and so forth? It's not easy, but it's best
    to be able to consider the organization's image and typographic identity as a
    whole, rather than as separate pieces.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    \ \r\n\r\nConsider dropping \"www\" from your URL. It makes the URL longer without
    adding anything useful. It's 2013 and everyone knows that \"[name].org\" is a
    URL. \r\n\r\nAlso, why does your organization's name start with \"the\" but your
    ULR doesn't? It would be better if they were consistent. If that's not possible,
    consider downplaying \"the\" in the name; it's a weak beginning for a name anyway.
    Maybe put \"the\" in smaller type."

    you shouldn't develop a thick skin ... it's a matter of you don't need one.\r\n\r\nGreen
    bg is ok, but it's to general. There's no hierarchy. And the white just knocks
    a hole right through it. Not every element should be all that dramatic. Drama
    is created by using a contrast or by using either a crescendo or decrescendo technique.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, as an example, a simple broad course brush stroke. The stroke imparts
    direction, movement, an organic aesthetic. Solid graphic design is knowing how
    to strip an idea down to what really matters ...removing all cheap sentiment.
    \  \r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\nEven with your second rendition I still don't

    Everything is from the gut and any helpful criticism is more than welcome. Here's

    \r\n\r\nThe Gift of Green is going to be an offshoot of my existing business.
    I can't stand the fact that by necessity, I've been focusing all my energy on
    catering to people with big bank accounts. It's become almost a luxury to be able
    to sit under a tree and read a book (that's what the logo image idea was all about.)
    \ Not to mention the native birds and bugs need the native plants to live. PLUS,
    I have a sick kid-it's not always easy to get her outside in nature, but when
    she does, those are always her best days, and I know that this is true for human
    beings in general. So I'm adding a service to my company which will enable us
    to go beyond the standard way of doing things- hopefully, being able to help ANYONE
    who wants a little bit of nature to have it. That's why I'm going nonprofit. So
    it needs to appeal to potential donors-those who give for environmental reasons,
    and human wellbeing reasons. That a lot to pack into one little logo. I want to
    channel Steve Jobs and Ernest Hemingway, that's all. No pressure.  And I don't

    remarks on several levels.\r\n\r\nTrying to be clever is lethal. Forcing a graphic
    to do tricks like it's performing in three ring circus is fine ...until the next
    trick comes along. And then it become used/stale. Most graphic designers try to
    be clever, try to find a trick. A clever twist on this on that. But the problem
    there is that it all becomes boringly clever. How many different ways can you
    merge letter shapes? How many different ways can you make words perform tricks?
    Until everything is nothing more than a clever little amusement ride of tricks???
    And upping the trick by adding an image to the text, only adds a smirk to the
    cleverness.  And on it's lowest level ...clever alignment dulls the senses.\r\n\r\nThat's
    the 'box' ...trying to be clever ...in my humble opinion of course.\r\n\r\nThe
    above graphic works because it is honest ...nothing more than overlayed raw relationships
    of organic expressions. The bottom layer is of natural forms in vibrant mono-color,
    a tree, a human figure, a field of grass. And the rhythms thereof. A top layer
    of unnatural forms in non-color, white Georgia type and black text blocks. And
    the rhythms thereof.\r\n\r\nOne dynamic organic rhythm over another. One rhythm
    of color, one rhythm of non-color (achromatic). And the viewer ...and that is
    where the rubber meets the road :) Allowing the viewer to participate... inviting
    the viewer to participate. Depth...\r\n\r\nNo tricks.  \r\n\r\nn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
