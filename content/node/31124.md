      food for thought though, a kind of retro fix. \r\n\r\nMike thanks for posting
      it. Think it would help the discussion to explain the accronyms. Maybe I am
      just old fashioned.\r\n\r\nSi, what do you really think about it?\r\n"

    \r\n\r\n>Microsoft announced its own anti-aliased type rendering in 1999, \r\n\r\nA
    reference to ClearType? That was November 1998. Apple, Adobe, Bitstream and others
    worked out the basics of how it worked and various people took similar techniques
    to market ahead of the Microsoft\u2019s first productization of the technology
    in the Microsoft Reader (eBook reader) which shipped in April 2000.\r\n\r\n>then
    included various anti-aliasing options in Windows starting in 2002, \r\n\r\nWindows
    XP? No that was October 2001. However, Windows 95 supported traditional anti-aliasing
    - the feature known as 'font smoothing' which, much like Mac OS, kicks in at larger
    sizes, or smaller sizes when the font asks for it.\r\n\r\nAlthough an accurate
    timeline might show Microsoft as the innovator here, you could always throw in
    a reference to Acorn, the obscure UK based computer maker that had a completely
    fuzzy rendering model as early as 1976 (by some accounts). ;-)\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    apart from that \u2013 a great article!\r\n\r\nThe interview was much more entertaining,
    with fewer factual errors, and I can't wait to see the idea in action. \r\n"

    Here's hoping so we can read the GD screen fonts without getting a headache!   \r\n\r\nSide
    note: I don't understand why increasing screen resolution, which is I suspect
    is actually the only really satisfactory solution, is not more of a priority with
    manufacturers. But then I also don't understand why for a century we've had to
    put up with terrible audio from telephones when good audio exists. I recently
    started talking on Skype, and it was such a pleasure to get decent audio in a
    phone conversation.   "

    can see a kid you love wiggle her loose tooth for you on the video phone which
    is totally what the 21st century was supposed to be like. No jet packs. No Moon
    base. But we do have that. \r\n\r\nI agree will Bill ( actually is that how you
    prefer to be refered to or not? I have seen other people do it & I am apeing them
    I suppose but I would prefer to know how you feel about it... ) that increasing
    screen rez & the current font tech is pretty acceptable *if* we were going to
    have it across devices. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think low rez may last a long time
    and regardless of how long low rez will or won't last there is a great deal to
    be said for creating an OS architecture on MS, OSX, Linux and portable OS' that
    is aware of and can switch to font data which is size specific. It would be amazing
    if that kind of tagging could be added to OpenType. Size specific design is the
    ideal in print obviously and I think it aught to be clear that it is definitely
    the ideal on screen too. If that font in question is pixel matched as DB suggests
    or not is to my mind a secondary issue. That is not to say it's not a worthwhile
    or unimportant one. Not at all.  But it assumes a stability of rez or a specificity
    of device which may or may not always be relevant. That said It is probably possible
    to make good looking fonts that are pixel matched at a given PPEM which also look
    good when not pixel matched on devices with higher PPEMs. But no matter the strategy
    the best looking font is always going to be the one which matches it's context
    the best. That it might be robust outside of that context it is a great secondary
    gain. The great thing about DB model as opposed to TT+hinting or Hrant's favorite
    pixel centric model is that it has far more room for that secondary gain to occur
    in."

    what I'm saying is full of sh*t, then begin \"Dr. Berkson,\" :) \r\n\r\nI'm sure
    that as you say for cost reasons the increase in screen resolution will come slowly,
    and small devices like phones may always have lower resolution. So certainly any
    advance in low resolution fonts will be a blessing to the poor reader. "
