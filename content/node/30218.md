    digital versions I can find are the Open version, but as I learned in past threads,
    you can strip out the black 'fill' layer from these letters many times.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I've wondered this myself. I always thought the Y was custom, but I guess
    it's not.\r\n\r\nI just hate that they shut down <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opryland_USA\">Opryland
    USA</a> and turned it into \"<a href=\"http://www.oprymills.com\">Shopryland</a>\"
    but kept the <a href=\"http://www.gaylordhotels.com/gaylordopryland/\">Hotel</a>.
    Oh well, I guess the mall is pretty cool. I used to shop there a lot when I worked
    a couple of miles from there.\r\n\r\nAt least we've still got <a href=\"http://www.opry.com/\">The
    Grand Ole Opry</a>, which splits its time between the Opry House and The Ryman.
    (My mom was an usher there in high school, as were both of my parents in college.)\r\n\r\nViva
    Nashvegas!\r\nAnyway, to get back on topic, Augustea does look right. Nice work,
    Mike."

        never did. It looks like the decorations are still up and it ends today. I
        think my girlfriend and I will be going tonight!

    was an Open version as well, called Aurea Inline). This was dropped between the
    time Image Club was acquired by Adobe and the point at which they ended up with
    Monotype Imaging. The only Aurea they sell now is a completely different font.\r\n\r\n-

    is just the company that owns Opryland Hotel. Apparently they own a chain of hotels.
    I think there's one in Orlando. Gaylord used to be an entertainment company, but
    I think they're in the hospitality business now."
