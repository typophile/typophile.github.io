    entries?\r\n\r\nJames, I'm kind bummed that this blog thing hasn't generated more
    interest. I was really excited about when the site relaunched. I though that the
    blogs would degenerate into weird coolness. One one side, Hrant could have a *real*
    soap box, from which to talk about legibility, [[Gerrit Noordzij]], politics,
    pixels, or whatever would be on his mind. On another side, others would go deep
    into their latest project or revival\u2026\r\n\r\noh well\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    maybe I can focus some new threds on more specific projects, rather than just
    rambelings. Do you know of a way to scan a listing of all the Blogs on Typophile.
    I can't seem to find a way to the Blogs other than directlly through someones
    profile page.\r\n\r\nYes, everyone should Wiki early and often."

  body: "I'm a bit frustrated by the apparent wiki bug. Many links lead to \"access
    denied,\" so one cannot see a lot of the older topics. Since there is not a real
    search yet either, I don't think that one can really search the wiki, making it
    more difficult to fill holes!\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "Thanks. The powers-that-be (you know who you are) should put a link to the
    blogs in the navagation.\r\n\r\nOK, about the \"access denied\" thing, this is
    what I have figured out so far. It appears that the Wiki is making up incorrect
    addresses for some of the links, and the addresses are case sensitive. For example,
    when you click on the \"Indicies\" link, it uses this address - http://typophile.com/wiki/indices.
    But it should be this - http://typophile.com/wiki/Indices. The difference is the
    cap \"I\" on \"Indices\" in the address.\r\n\r\nAnother example: This link to
    Blackletter - http://typophile.com/wiki/Blackletter, should have a lower case
    \"b\". So there doesen't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the link names case.\r\n\r\nI
    have also found this kind of link - http://typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif, which
    dosen't work. the \"%20\" part of that address represents a \"space\", so that
    is OK. But if I change the first \"s\" to a \"S\" then it works. Hmmm.\r\n\r\nI
    have also found this oddity. In a Wiki link to a string like \" Barnhart Brothers
    & Spindler\", it will truncate it to \"Barnhart Brothers\", ignoring everthing
    after the \"&\"... sometimes... not all the time.\r\n\r\nI think I understand
    the -Title Link|Title Displayed- syntax, but I don't think everyone gets this.
    Not everyone is going to type -American Type Founders|ATM-. And since there is
    not a real search yet, it is sometimes hard to tell if a Wiki link does not have
    an entry or if it is not linking properlly to an existing entry. I guess we just
    have to police this as best we can to try to avoid multiple entrys."
