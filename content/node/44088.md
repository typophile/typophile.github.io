  this mean that I cant access the Small Caps of my shiny new typeface National in
  flash at all, because its embedded the opentype features of the face? Has anyone
  else been peeved by this or found a solution? I take it the SC would need to be
  their own file?\r\n\r\nFlash needs to get with the program, this is lame.\r\n\r\nOn
  a side note Im looking for a serif companion to National, if you are familiar to
  the face Im open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ng"
