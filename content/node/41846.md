    colletion for something similar\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=26&subpage=viewfonts\r\n"

  body: "I think Patty is right about it being custom, like most logos. TJ's is interesting
    because most of their product labeling uses very recognizable fonts, and not their
    logo type, except to represent their brand name.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to see
    that apparently no one has asked this question here before, according to a Google
    search of this site.\r\n\r\nBTW, I also looked at Jason Walcott's Jukebox fonts
    at Veer. His Tiki family might have had some close ones, but actually they were
    less similar than Patty's suggestion.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    me some handlettered goodness!

  body: "I'm more convinced than ever that their logo is custom. See [[http://www.traderjoes.com/about_tjs.html|this
    page]] from their own web site. The lettering of YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD GROCERY STORE
    is House [[http://www.traderjoes.com/about_tjs.html|Tiki Magic]]. If they had
    a 'Trader Joe's font' I doubt they would mix it with something so close on the
    same page. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    which is similar, but not too much like the TJ's logotype. Apparently TJ's thought
    the House font was a closer match to their Hawaiian style.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
