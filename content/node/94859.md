body: "Hello,\r\nMy company wants to sort out font management issues and, after looking
  at different options, we're considering buying software from either Extensis or
  Linotype.\r\nBut the bigger question than which software maker to go with, however,
  is <em>should we buy several client licenses or a server license</em>? We couldn't
  fully understand the exact way font server works, so any explanations (<em>as you'd
  talk to a child</em>) are welcome.\r\n\r\n<ol>Could you recommend the right choice
  based on the below?\r\n<li>Currently, 6 computers would need constant access to
  the font library (5 Macs and 1 PC). This number may increase in the future but not
  drastically.</li>\r\n<li>The designers would need the ability to search and preview
  <em>all</em> the fonts in our library. Does font server allow to do that without
  importing everything (hundreds) first to the client?</li>\r\n<li>Ability to check
  if a font contains specific features and glyphs.</li>\r\n<li>Auto activate fonts
  in Adobe CS (5, 5.5)</li></ol>\r\n\r\nThe second point is very important to us as
  we have hundreds of fonts, so the discoverability is crucial. Ideally, we'd like
  to be able to perform search based on keywords (like you do at any online font store)
  and choose/activate the right typeface based on preview.\r\n\r\nAlso, what are your
  preferences for storing fonts on a server/hard drive? Do you put all the fonts to
  one folder? Do you sort them according to style, foundry, format etc? Would you
  use Mac or PC for a font server (our general file server is Windows PC)?\r\n\r\nIf
  you could point us in the right direction, that would be great. Thanks!"

    library (5 Macs and 1 PC). This number may increase in the future but not drastically.</blockquote>\r\nBoth
    the Extensis (UTS/UTC) and Linotype/Monotype (FontExplorer X Pro) tools would
    allow you to do this and with significantly more computers. I have seen successful
    implementations of both tools with hundreds of clients per server.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The
    designers would need the ability to search and preview all the fonts in our library.
    Does font server allow to do that without importing everything (hundreds) first
    to the client?</blockquote>\r\nIn order to preview the fonts you also need to
    download them to the client computer. Usually you only perform one download per
    client and so the process of previewing fonts is not slowed down by constant network
    traffic. By way of example, if you have 10,000 fonts you would perform one download
    per client, which might take 20 minutes depending on the network transfer speeds,
    server location, etc... but then you should find that each client can preview
    and organise that font data seamlessly. You would then only encounter new network
    traffic when new fonts were added to the server. The mechanisms for downloading
    and previewing are different for each product but I am not clear on the technicalities.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Ability
    to check if a font contains specific features and glyphs.</blockquote>\r\nFontExplorer
    has a sophisticated tool built in that allows users to look at metadata, characters,
    Unicode values and optical and metric kerning. UTS/UTC uses the native character
    palette tools to display this information, at least in the Mac environment.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Auto
    activate fonts in Adobe CS (5, 5.5)</blockquote>\r\nBoth tools currently support
    auto-activation for these versions of Adobe CS.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Ideally, we'd
    like to be able to perform search based on keywords (like you do at any online
    font store) and choose/activate the right typeface based on preview.</blockquote>\r\nThe
    functionality associated with this is currently more sophisticated in the Extensis
    product."

      only option requires the whole font library to be imported first in order to
      perform full search/preview (as I understood you), what is the advantage of
      the (more expensive) font server?"

  body: "<blockquote>what is the advantage of the (more expensive) font server?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWith
    a large client distribution base the advantage is having a single repository of
    fonts that everyone refers to. This gives you the ability to configure that repository
    based on the requirements of specific users, which is particularly useful when
    you start to look at larger user numbers and need to adhere to smaller license
    figures, e.g., you may have some fonts licensed for only 10 users and so need
    to restrict access to those fonts.\r\n\r\nBoth tools also provide a fallback mechanism
    through the server option which allows you to continue working in the event that
    something should happen to the primary server. Each tool delivers this fallback
    in a different way but ultimately to the same end."

      is a bit over the top?\r\n\r\nHmm, I really hoped font server software would
      allow our designers to directly connect to/search/preview the shared font library
      on a server <em>without</em> the need to import everything to the client each
      time new font is added. Why would such inconvenience be needed?\r\n\r\nOr am

  body: "<blockquote>Why would such inconvenience be needed?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    think it has to do with the mechanism for displaying the type requiring a local
    instance of it in order for the rendering to occur. Otherwise the rendering is
    being done across the server connection, which would cause a considerable amount
    of server traffic. These two tools approach this differently and I cannot speak
    definitively for either one, it is possible that the UTS tool allows server browsing
    without a download occurring.\r\n\r\nOne of the upsides of the download approach
    is that users can then work offline from the server until they require any new
    additions, particularly useful for laptop users."

  body: "UTS deals with this problem by downloading the font, yes. This is a physical
    and logical requirement for client-side rendering, and allows easy changing of
    sample text content, size, etc. Fonts downloaded by UTS solely for preview purposes
    are NOT made easily accessible on the client machine, however. Whether they are
    cached or not depends on the replication mode the user is set to (on demand, on
    demand local cache, or \"all\").\r\n\r\nDo you have a network admin type person
    to set up the system, and help with occasional network-related issues? Although
    it is not rocket science, some familiarity with technical network/server tech
    is required for setup of either UTS or FEXS."

    share a common font repository, share sets, share added metadata, track licensing,
    and the like. Much of which might help in finding fonts, mind you."

  body: Thanks for all answers. We have installed a trial version of UTS and so far
    so good. The preview works well and centralised shared sets are very helpful.
    However, the client could have more methods for font and glyph comparison, e.g.
    a grid view for better screen use. In general, the server software seems to work
    without any problems, but the UI could be improved.
