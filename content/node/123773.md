  way as the main menu of [[http://www.wired.com]]. I have been trying Typekit's alternatives
  in different sizes, weights and letter-spacing; but I haven't found the right one
  yet.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nJL"

  body: "Thank you for both suggestions. I know Oxide can be licensed, but I want
    to avoid having to buy it. \r\n\r\nOrbitron and Purista seem to be the best alternatives,
    but both have minor disadvantages. The regular weight would suit me best, but
    it's not available for both."
