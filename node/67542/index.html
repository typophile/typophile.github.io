  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

This is for a school project. We're supposed to come up with a name for a fake TV channel, design a logo and guidelines. Quote from the brief "We segue effortlessly from escapist, to gritty, to humanitarian, to sensationalist". They show drama, reality TV, films, soaps and nice programmes.

Target audience -> Love being entertained, 16-45 with slight male bias, cultural mix, articulate, not affluent but have sophisticated spending and tastes.

I've chosen Capra as a name. Taken from the Alpine mountain goat (Capra Ibex) and italian director Frank Capra. Here I have some logo suggestions where I've modified Clarendon to try and make it more contemporary. Clarendon has a nice property that reminds of the big round horns of the Capra Ibex.

Any feedback much appreciated.

		<div class="commentbody">To me the shape of the letters and the round terminals give it a playful and/or feminine vibe, really don't think you're hitting the feel you're going for at this point. I do like the name, though the addition of "vision" comes off as a bit forced and sort of cliched (not to mention competing with the main title in that serif face).

Have you thought about maybe drawing typographic inspiration from some more cinematic sources, maybe classic movie posters and the like?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I hear what you're saying. Didn't see the feminine vibe when I made it. This might actually go really well for another project for a female quire, I think I'll use this modification of Clarendon for that instead.

Made another version that has more of a old movie poster feel to it.
Slightly modified Industria with some retro color versions.

This is perhaps more in the right direction, more masculine version but not too much.

		<div class="commentbody">Got a suggestion in class today to change the 'c' to a 'k'. So that it's not directly Frank Capra's last name. The 'k' works better next to the a as well.

I'm worried that it might be a little hard. Looks a lot harder then with a 'c'.

Haven't been able to connect the 'c' and the 'a' in a nice way yet.

any thoughts?

This is a version with a new 'c'. One that connects better with the rest of the letters. It's taken from the 'p'.

Agreed. Now it looks like '@p@'. I think you need to find the happy medium between this and the earlier 'c'.</div>

Made my new C into one where the right edges are rounded.
1. Looks angry.
2. Kinda nice but looks a little angry as well.
3. less angry but feels uneven.
4. Think this is my favourite.
5. Retard.

any feedback much appreciated.

but as you've noted they feel angry, the rythym is rather jarring.

I still really prefer the original C with some 'friendlying up' of the other characters...all depends on the style of station though I guess.</div>
