  body: "To me, these are 2 different \"fonts\" (even if I don't think they're actually
    font, more custom letterings). \r\nFor the CD cover, I don't think it's Evolette,
    even if they're obviously in the same vein (trend) but they share the same backbone,
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura/fonts/|Futura]]. \"SWISS FRANCS (REMIX)
    FEAT. BOOBA\" is actually set in Futura. \"RYAN LESLIE\" looks like to have been
    done using Futura too (/R with /P, /Y and /A redrawn to fit together, doubled
    oblique bar /N, original /L, doubled horizontal middle bar /E, redrawn /S, originals
    /L and /I and modified /E). You could also have a look to a [[http://typophile.com/node/98172|list
    of fonts in the same vein]] I recently compiled (TWOFACED, Echelon, Rathe, Parqa,
    Fonecian, Finding 57, Harf 77, Labieno, Positano, Marina, Alumia...).\r\nFor \"TECHNO\",
    I agree with fvilanakis, custom job based on Alternate Gothic No.2 (or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/|Trade
    Gothic Condensed Bold no.20]])."
