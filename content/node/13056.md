body: "Fine Gold\r\n\r\nI was browsing through <a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/\">American
  Memory</a>, an online collection of primary source material provided by the Library
  of Congress found an advertisement for a jewelry store selling watches. Of the six
  faces used in the advert, one caught my eye. The only words set in it were \"FINE
  GOLD WATCHES,\" the resolution is poor, and the original was a newsprint -- so this
  font is at best an interpretation. Any thoughts?"
