  of building development (even though we are going through an economic crisis). I
  was surprised to see how many large and expensive towers are going up, so close
  to each other and in almost all of the building sites, the hoardings are branded
  using Gotham... No real competition here, everyone copying each other, depressing!\r\n\r\n
  Some samples here, sorry for the dark grainy images."

    depression called Helvetica, have now awaked and miss something.

    (aka Standard) were well used.\r\nI took these photos in London and East Anglia

    logical explanation...they are all the same developer and/or they are all using
    the same design/PR/marketing firm?"

    An awful lot of\r\ncopperplate. I have no idea why."

  body: "Perhaps they all use the same design/PR/marketing. They are not the same
    developer though and 3 of them are in competition with each other, they are luxury
    residential buildings.\r\nThe architecture of the four projects is also quite
    different. \r\n\r\nTwo of the identities are also similar in that they take some
    inspiration from the architecture. The Harlequin tower fills the Gotham strokes
    with a pattern of trusses, a motif taken from the architecture. And the Neo Bankside
    project apart from using Gotham uses another typeface with chamfered corners which
    also alludes to the structural elements of the building, designed by Richard Roger's
    office."
