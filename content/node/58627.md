body: "I am trying to use the autohint script from the Adobe FDK (OSX). It seems to
  work better than the FL5 built in script and I really like the checking feedback
  about the outlines \u2014 however, I am not a nerd anymore (too old), so here are
  two really dumb questions:\r\n\r\n1. I cannot find a way to enter the metrics and
  standard stems info into the script. Does it come from the font itself?\r\n2. I
  also installed the FL5 scripts in the macros directory. Is the AutoHint.py that
  the same script with same functionality?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "1. Yes, the font needs to have those set before using the autohint tool on
    it.\r\n\r\n2. The FL macro won't generate flex hints. Apart from that the two
    are essentially the same, AFAIK."

  body: Thanks, Miguel. So, is running the script with the -nb switch the default?
    Is that not strange?

  body: "No, the default is to run the tool with no switches.\r\n\r\nThe autohint
    tool requires the font to have stem widths and alignment zones (AKA blue values).
    These enable the tool to do a good \"automatic hinting job\". Use the font editor
    to set these parameters.\r\n\r\nIf you try to ran a font without stem widths and
    alignment zones through the autohint, the tool will simply complain and quit.
    The -nb switch will prevent the tool from quitting, but the hinting result will
    obviously be not as good."

    tool generate flex hints automatically, or does this require a specific parameter
    to be set?"

  body: "Rachel, the switch or option is entered on the command line before the arguments:\r\n\r\nautohint
    -nb myfont.otf\r\n\r\nI cannot make the script run without it, although it has
    metrics and standard stems defined. The font I am working on has no overhangs
    though, so \u2018blue zone\u2019 is not defined (it's zero). Perhaps that's the
    culprit. Anyway, the result is very good even with the -nb switch."

    the same as autohint from the terminal window ? '

  body: "The autohint command-line tools will generate flex hints unless you specifically
    supress it with the '-nf' option. \r\n\r\nNote: it generates flex hints everywhere
    where they are legal. This is way too many. This does no harm, but is surprising
    when you look closely at the font. I will eventually fix this, but since autohint
    has been doing this since 1986, the priority is low.\r\n\r\n- Read"
