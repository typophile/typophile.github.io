  book design charges.\r\n\r\nI come from about 30 years of overall graphic design
  experience \u2014 corporate, publishing, whatever.\r\n\r\nI've just recently shifted
  my focus to designing memoirs and books on spirituality, art and poetry.\r\n\r\nI'm
  working with individuals now, not companies or university presses and I wondered
  if anyone else out there has any experience in this.\r\n\r\nPattyfab, I love your
  work. I used your pricing methods for a memoir project that I did over the summer.
  But it was for a high-end client. I don't think these kinds of prices will work
  for those who aren't high end.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions beyond
  the previous thread of book design fees?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nRobin"

  body: "What you want to make (after expenses, taxes, non-billable time, etc.) multiplied
    by hours spent working. \r\n\r\nWorks well for pretty much everything. After a
    while one gets pretty good at estimating how much time a project will take, which
    clients can  and are willing to pay a higher rate, and even which projects you
    can narrow your margins on to \"help\" the client - but always be careful with
    that last one. Price setting can help convey the idea of quality and expertise
    of the product or service but push too far to an extreme and you'll either lose
    opportunities or gain ones that are not worth having."

  body: "Thanks, bemerx25.\r\n\r\nYes. I will probably have to just muddle along for
    awhile and see what this new market can bear as I start out lower than I am accustomed
    to.\r\n\r\nGood advice.\r\n\r\nRobin"
