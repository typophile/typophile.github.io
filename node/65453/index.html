  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Seeing as how the good folks at Typophile are making rumblings about improvements*, I figured to throw out something. It's not some breakthrough idea, but I'm hoping it gets enough traction that sooner rather than later it becomes a reality.

* http://typophile.com/node/65428

<strong>Let's have a way of pointing at things on images embedded in threads.</strong> The obvious reference is Flickr (adding a "note" to an image). It doesn't have to be anything fancy - it might even start out as an asterisk or something you place on an image, and it links to a post below that talks about it. Ideally it would be nice to be able to write text (or even draw? :-) directly inside the note. However it would also be nice to have any text (or image) replicated (preferably while indicating that it's a duplicate) as plain text in/as a post like it is now.

Obviously this is not a trivial task. It might be possible to do without Flash* but certainly Flash would be the ideal medium. But it would remove a very large obstacle in the way of giving valuable feedback on something, thus increasing the quality and quantity of feedback.

* For example there might be software that takes an image, makes a second one with the notes on it, and you could see that by clicking on the orginal image in the thread (or via a -very slow- animated GIF).

Besides making Typophile [even] more useful, I think it will bring the most important thing about this site (no, it's not type IDs...) back to the forefront: type critiques.

<strong>What do you guys think?</strong>

And if we need to raise money for this, here's an idea: we have a system where a person who wants to use that feature pays a yearly or one-time fee of a few dollars, and his account would then have it enabled. We could even have tiers where you can get to view the notes but not add any, for a smaller fee; in that case not paying anything would prevent you from seeing any notes (just the original image).

		<div class="commentbody">This is a great idea. For example being able to comment type samples via something like Flickr's «notes» would be awesome (and very helpful), potentially making critiques easier, clearer and less cluttered.

It'd be great if it worked without Flash, for accessibility (like thinking of mobile devices). And I think it can, potentially even with more complex possibilities than just adding an asterisk (which would already be very cool though). BTW, I believe Flickr's «notes» don't use Flash, but I might be wrong. XHTML/DHTML is pretty powerful, if a bit more twiddly to develop. 

I'm not sure that having people draw into images is really necessary – for one thing, drawing with a mouse at that tiny size will be a pretty coarse affair, plus there's visual clutter to mind, especially when more than one person does it.

I don't get the duplicating/replicating thing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey, get Apple to add some real features to the iDon't. Not to mention a proper hi-res screen so you can do more reading and less panning & zooming; 160 ppi is so 2007.

Nina, by replication I meant that any comment (or maybe even graphic) on the image should also be accessible in the traditional comments area.

Darrel, that would be nicely easy, but it doesn't seem right to depend on another site (and require people to create a leechy Yahoo account).

About the "painting": maybe all we need is a set of typable graphic primitives, like lines, arrows, etc.

More on fundraising: if it's too financially risky to build first and charge later, Typophile could collect in advance and in the worst case refund people if it doesn't work out. I think there's enough goodwill here for that to work (or at least build enough confidence to take the plunge and eventually raise the rest of the money).
