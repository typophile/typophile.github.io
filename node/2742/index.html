<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I posted this on another thread about sketches, I think this spot is a better fit. <br> <br>These are a few initial directions of an identity system for a truck decaling company in NJ. Pretty much they travel the NJ/NY/PA area putting gigantic decals on trucks like FedEx (I worked for them and after staring at that logo for entire summer I no longer see the ingenuity of the "hidden" arrow) and other big names. It's tedious work, blowtorches are involved, and it's blue collar. So that's the background. <br> <br>I am of course interested in receiving feedback on my work. As most who post their work on these forums, I am very open to criticism. <br> <br>I only have two jpgs of pencil sketches. My Illustrator sketches are in the preliminary stages. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24323.jpg alt="sketch 1"> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24324.gif alt="logo 3"> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24325.gif alt="logo type"> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24326.gif alt="logo 4"> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24327.gif alt="logo 1"> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24328.gif alt="logo 2"></div>

<div class=commentbody>The bottom one is great in every way! <br>Just chop off that appendage off the middle bar of the "E". <br> <br>Another possibility: try one large "V" (like your first one) where the arms become the horns - or maybe that would get too gothic... <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Hrant. <br> <br>Yeah, the V with horns didn't work. I had that idea but the sketch looked bad. It was worth a shot. I do live in Chicago... <br> <br>What do you think about the spacing between letters? I even kerned while viewing it upside down... I'm nervous about the "A L" space and the horizontal position of "DECAL". That appendage on the E is stupid. Oops. <br> <br>The typeface is some random one that I spent a long time fixing to look like that. I may as well have started from scratch. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24331.gif alt=gobulls></div>

<div class=commentbody>I redrew the helmet to be a head on from slightly above. The logo is now a square. I'm not sure about the leading now, nor am I completely comfortable with the distance between the type and the sides. I think I'm creating some spacing problems by using an exact square. Then again, I can always redraw the helmet to help me out. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24338.gif alt="logo posneg"></div>

<div class=commentbody>The straight helmet is stronger, but less interesting. <br> <br>Spacing: "AL" tighter, and maybe the "IK" slightly too - it's hard to tell at that low resolution. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd suggest going back to the rotated-helmet concept, but having the higher horn on the left. I would also encourage you to really think about the helmet's shape, and how it would silhouette; I feel like the horns are strangely skewed in your initial drawings. <br> <br>I'd definitely round the tips of the horns as you did in your most recent image; it makes them more "hornlike", and takes the egde off the counterchanging.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I concur with Hrant regarding the angled view of the helmet, and more specifically with Shreyas' direction of "having the higher horn on the left", or rather the red horn in the white area (whichever side it ends up being on). <br> <br>Have you explored any solutions "outside of the box", but within the same direction as this concept? Maybe there's no red frame outlining the red area and the type, and red type is to the right of the mark. Perhaps try framing the graphic mark only, then positionig the type somewhere outside of the rectangle. Try creating a random red and white/negative space checker pattern (not a square board) and incorporating the elements (graphic and type) into a portion of that pattern. Just some ideas</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with Drew. I'd love to see you develop the peeling sticker logo idea a bit more. Could be really great, if you balance the strong/ bold design with just a little wit. Though, I suppose it could be seen as peeling <i>off</i>, rather than being applied. <br> <br>I also agree with Hrant. The angled helmet's much more interesting. Personally, I like the one set in the V maybe with some centered type. It's bold and simple but not boring. The strong V makes up for the less impactful shape. (also taking a refined helmet into account) <br> <br>Of course, this is posted after the weekend, so you've probably moved on. Oh well, 2 cents in.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I didn't have much time to work on this, but here's a little update. <br> <br>I changed the helmet. It looks better, but it's not great. I messed around with the pos/neg ideas on the computer, results aren't as good as I'd hoped. I'm thinking about combining the peeling-off V with the pos/neg idea. Who knows. <br> <br>I played around with type/object positioning, but it's not there yet. Any objections to my type choice? Any suggestions? I don't think it looks right if it's not in white with a red backing. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24482.gif alt="lots of logos"> <br> <br>As I previewed this gif I thought of extending the red rectangle all the way left to back up the type, then change the type to white. That could go somewhere.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Daniel, <br> <br>I like what you've done with the helmet. I'd like to see your last idea (extend red rectangle left and knock out text to white) executed.

<div class=commentbody>I think the helment is strong, but the pos/neg stuff weakens it. <br> <br>I like the all-dark helmet. What if the V was in the helmet, rather than the other way around? Perhaps like a V applied on the helmet? (It's a bit sports-ish, though.) <br> <br>I'm going to throw another idea out there, because it's gnawing at my brain now. What if you gave the helmet a nose guard (<a href=http://www.northerner.com/large_images/scg-s52b.jpg>example</a>), but in the shape of the counterform of the V or a V itself? Then you might be able to use that straight-on view from before.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Daniel, <br> <br>Just put two and two together with your ID thread. I was thinking this was Schwabesque. <br> <br>A side note about viking helmets: <a href=http://elfwood.lysator.liu.se/loth/l/u/luiro/vikinghelmet_01_copy.jpg.html>no horns</a> <br>But you probably want to keep them for recognition since the myth is more recognized than the original. I think you can add some more details and still be simple enough. Perhaps some rivet highlights? Mabe the eye/nose mask? Maybe not? <br> <br>I'd also try non-horizontal type treatments. Circle, with VIKING between the horns and DECAL below? Maybe a simple U shape below the helm? <br> <br>Whoops, just got another idea. Second to the viking helmet in recognizability is the viking longship. I think that might make a more compelling image. <br> <br>For inspiration: <br><a href=http://www.celticcharms.com/viloshpe.html target=_blank>http://www.celticcharms.com/viloshpe.html</a> <br><a href=http://www.lysator.liu.se/nordic/mirror/longship/0298hale.html target=_blank>http://www.lysator.liu.se/nordic/mirror/longship/0298hale.html</a> <br><a href=http://www.woodenboat.com/ target=_blank>http://www.woodenboat.com/</a> <br> <br>Definitely less clich</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the solid square with the type + helmet, but I'm not sure if you need the reversed square in there...it's almost too much. Maybe try one with just the white helmet? <br> <br>The peeling V is also actually quite nice, though it may seem more like it's 'falling off' rather than 'being applied'. Ie, it may look like a shoddy decal that's coming off. Still, I like it.</div>
