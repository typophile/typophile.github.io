  \ I hope you can cut and past it into your address search bar.  The font I like
  is used for the announcement on Sophi Grace, Emily, Hayden and Sydnee and a few
  others as well.  I really like how the l's and h's all curve over the other letters
  it's just a really nice font.  Any help would be so GREATLT appreciated.  Thanks
  in advance\r\n"
