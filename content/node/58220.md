  body: "I thought that that g and y style of descender was pretty common among Bauhaus/geometric
    style typefaces. But I was wrong. Even the extensive alternate-rich Mark Simonson's
    Mostra Nuova (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova/), which
    features a similar g, doesn't offer the right y (a feature for Mostra Nuovissima,
    Mark? ;-)\r\nFor typeface in the style you can peruse Mike Yanega's Bauhaus-style
    Font ID Guide (http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces.html).\r\nHere's some
    suggestion for similar construction:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/cubo/cyclo/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/atype/scripio-a-simple/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/register-sans-btn/\r\n\r\nThat
    said, if it's just for something quick & dirt...\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/cyclo.font"
