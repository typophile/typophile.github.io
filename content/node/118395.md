body: "Book design question: My editor wants the author bio before the text. I\u2019ve
  been pondering various solutions, and came up with the attached PDF. The bio texts
  are rather long, and I don\u2019t want to push the title too far down the page.
  \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s two navigational issues: A: The title of the chapter is on
  the left page (which makes browsing harder then necessary). B: The first page of
  a chapter omits the page number (ditto).\r\n\r\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts
  on this. Do you know any other examples of books where the author bio is the first
  element in the chapter?\r\n"

  body: "Why don't you want to push the title too far down the page? Chapter titles
    a third or even half-way down the page are not uncommon. \r\n\r\nThat would help
    solve the major issue with your layout, which is that the biography text looks
    way too similar to the main text \u2013 it looks like a hangover block quote from
    the previous chapter (compare the next page!) and its nearness in style (especially
    in terms of left margin) gives it a slightly-off, disharmonious, unintentional
    impression. (You know, the old maxim of making things that are different singnificantly
    different.)\r\n\r\nWith more space, or even without it, you could do any number
    of things to make it less similar to the main text. Set it futher left. Add a
    right margin. Switch typeface (to a sans?). Set it in bold or italic. Give it
    more space above the title. Set it in a shaded panel. Etc. etc."

    think the pages looks unbalanced when the title is too far down. Anyway, fair
    points."

  body: "Some semi-random thoughts:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The navigational issues you mention
    are pretty usual. Except maybe the fact that it&rsquo;s more common to have the
    book title on the verso and the chapter title on the recto. Losing also the page
    number is unfortunate, but in a book it happens in several places, for a variety
    of practical or traditional reasons.</li>\r\n<li>There is a range of length for
    the bios? Otherwise, a particularly lengthy or short one could break things apart.</li>\r\n<li>What
    distracts me in your example is mainly the setting of the running head, which
    in places (see page 4), interacts a bit too much with the main text.</li>\r\n<li>Finally,
    echoing Johan&rsquo;s advice, you could try to differentiate more the bio text
    from the main text, maybe also tightening the leading. But what I mainly would
    try to do is creating a hierarchy inside the page: <ol><li>Author</li> <li>Title</li>
    <li>Text</li></ol> For that you will probably need to highlight in some way the
    author&rsquo;s name so that the bio text would be supporting it in its role.</li></ul>"

  body: "Some additional information from the editor just made my initial example
    mute, but in general it is the hierarchy I\u2019m struggling with here. I want
    the biography to appear less important than the text, while still being at the
    top. I could take a number of different routes to get there (cursive, smaller
    size, contrasting typeface), but none of the ones I\u2019ve tested so far <em>feels</em>
    right. Hence, I\u2019m interested in seeing how others may have solved similar
    problems."

    counterintuitively, to achieve a similar effect, you could use the title font
    Arnheim Fine for the bio text too."

  body: "The chapter-opening page numbers are the ones referenced in the table of
    contents, so chapter openers should always have a folio (page number).\r\nWhen
    the standard placement of the page number is at the top, on the chapter-opening
    pages you can put the page number at the bottom. This practice is sufficiently
    well-established that there's a name for it in graphic-design jargon: It's called
    a <em>drop folio</em>.\r\nThe author biography does dominate the layout too much
    as it stands. I suggest you increase the indent for the author bio and reduce
    the point size and leading a bit to compensate for the shorter line length. And
    try making the chapter titles larger and/or bolder (unless you have some very
    long chapter titles). "

  body: "<em>drop folio</em>\r\n\r\nThanks. My thoughts exactly, but not ideal. Better
    to put the pagination and running headers at the bottom of the page, to avoid
    confusion with the bio text. (And hopefully get the editor to shorten them a little
    bit.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/neue_3630.png]"
