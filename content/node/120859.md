body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nLike many first-time posters, I'm not entirely new to the site,
  having lurked in the shadows for a while.\r\n\r\nI won't give you a full biography
  now, but will tell you that I've developed an unhealthy interest in type design
  since being forced to reinvent myself due to illness.  My background is technology
  sales, not design, so my efforts have tended towards the simple.  Which is why I
  find myself in need of some opinions about my latest font.\r\n\r\nLet me try to
  set the scene.\r\n\r\nImagine walking a well-known street.  Every so often, you
  check out an unknown side street , but you don't walk too far down it, because your
  instincts are to stick with what you are familiar with.  However, on one occasion,
  you find yourself in one of these side streets by accident and walk a bit further
  down it.  You're not comfortable - you keep turning, about to retrace your steps,
  but an inner voice tells you to keep exploring this strange street.  \r\n\r\nYou
  get to a point where you have to make a decision: return or keep going?   This is
  where I am with this design.\r\n\r\nI was editing the internal contour of an 'O'
  in a geometric sans I'd been drawing when I accidentally changed a smooth node to
  a corner node.  There was something about this 'pinched' contour I liked, even though
  I didn't (and still don't) understand why, and I ended up creating a set of lower
  case glyphs based on this idea.  I've created a TTF file and you can see the output
  in the linked PDF below.\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/e290ad9e0c.pdf\r\n\r\nI'm
  incredibly conflicted about what I have and have held back on designing the upper
  case glyphs until I can resolve the way I feel about it.  Sometimes I look at individual
  letterforms and hate them; sometimes, I look at the same letterforms and love their
  quirkiness.  The only time I consistently like what I have so far is when I see
  a segment of body text at around 36pt and it's for this reason I'm asking for the
  community's view.\r\n\r\nDoes this design have promise (and, if so, any thoughts
  about refining the characters I have) or, should I turn back to my well-known street?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance, Steve"

  body: I would continue working on this your second already pdf looks nicer -  and
    I like the squarish o counter. Looking at the letters in a half-focused way the  o's
    seemed to have a small pinch in the upper left corner of the counter. You can
    experiment with such a design idea, exaggerate it perhaps make a half or complete
    cut there, and start the letter as if it were made with a calligraphic rounded
    brush.  Or end the stroke with a little flourish? Whatever you do carry on the
    new style to the other letters in a uniform way- now the the b for example looks
    too sedate and incongruent next to the o.

  body: "Steve, life is funny, isn't it.\r\n\r\nAlthough you arrived at the peculiar
    countershape via a happy accident, to me the most notable thing is that it looks
    like a reflection of the traditional, calligraphic way of making letterforms via
    a broad-nib pen. So I think the main decision you need to first take is whether
    to revert to that construction and have a much easier time completing a font that
    presumably you and certainly many others would find attractive, or to instead
    try to avoid that reference and make something truly fresh, which however would
    be a greater challenge.\r\n\r\nAs for the caps, that's actually another tricky
    fork in the road. You can make caps that essentially look like a separate alphabet
    (the conventional way) or you can try to innovate and make caps that look like
    they belong with the lowercase (for which you might look to uncial).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    off of this font in an attempt to apply more calligraphic principles, it's nice
    to be able to put a bit of weight back in! \r\n\r\nI also rotated the tittles

    /t/ has been a recurring issue for me.  The very first draft of the font, which
    preceded the first upload here, had a more conventional round foot, but I didn't
    like it.  I have actually tried a couple more times to introduce it since discussing
    the font here, but I always end up preferring the straighter style.  Do you think
    this font is desperately crying out for a rounded /t/?\r\n\r\nAs for the stroke
    endings, I've experimented a little here as well.  Again, going back to my first
    'pre-Typophile' version, the stroke endings you mentioned terminated with a curl,
    similar to the right sides of the /v/, /w/, /x/ and /y/ found in earlier versions
    (such as http://freepdfhosting.com/e290ad9e0c.pdf).  They've since been 'iterated'
    out, but do you think the font would now work better if I reintroduced them, or
    some variation on that theme?\r\n\r\nI have to say that  really like the asymmetrical
    crossbars and the serifs, which use the same shape.  That doesn't mean to say
    I opposed to change and I'll certainly experiment with other ideas.\r\n\r\n@hrant

    darker at that pinch point.  On review, I think I need the lighten the /g/ just
    a little bit in the same area.\r\n\r\nThe /b/ & /q/ corners were shaved to solve
    a weight issue I had at that juncture.  The curve of the stroke naturally thickens
    at that point.  With the /p/ and /d/, I could get away with thinning the stroke
    because the descender gave balance, but a thinner stroke on the /b/ looked wrong
    absent a descender.  I also looked at simply flipping the /d/ to create a /b/
    but, aside from seeming a lazy solution, it left the pinch points on the opposite
    side to where they should be.  I hope that makes sense, as I don't have time right
    now to post an image.  \r\n\r\nAny ideas on an alternative solution?\r\n\r\nI'm
    similarly stumped for a solution to my /Y/ problem.  Virtually all stems flare
    asymmetrically.  Single-stemmed glyphs flare to the left at the base; double-stemmed
    glyphs flare to the left on the left stem and to the right on the right stem.
    \ In the case of the /m/ - the only, but logical, exception - the middle stem
    flares both left and right.\r\n\r\nI treated the /Y/ in the same way as, for example,
    the /f/ - a single flare to the left.  But, because the /Y/ stem isn't long enough
    for the flare to even out, the original version had a horribly unbalanced look,
    which I tried to address by shifting the arms to the left.  If your view is that
    this remains a problem, the only solution I can think of is to remove the flare
    altogether, since going the other way and creating a symmetrical flare makes the
    stem too dark. \r\n\r\nDo you think a flare-less /Y/ would be acceptable as an
    illogical exception?  Or, do you have any other ideas I could experiment with?

    on the /6/ and /9/ tails so that they also kink?\r\n\r\n- the /5/ has also been
    calmed down a bit.  The curves angles are less pronounced and the flare extends
    up instead of down.\r\n\r\n- stroke modulation on the /2/ has been increased very
    slightly.  \r\n\r\n- some weight has been taken off of the stem of the /7/.  I

    profit from a bit more space between the stem and the near-contact points, though.
    I feel like your design is characterized by open, springy forms, and this closed
    and aggressive double curve won't quite fit.\r\n\r\n/\xF0 is definitely better
    now! Can't say I noticed a change in /\xDE, but you might as well leave it like
    that; it's pretty much impossible to make look right in a sans (except maybe in
    a very blocky one where you can exaggerate the bowl).\r\n\r\nI rather like your
    open /&, but you should pick the one <em>you</em> like best for your default,
    obviously. If you want to tweak the open one some more, maybe try a slightly longer
    outstroke on the rising diagonal in order to balance out that large whitespace?\r\n\r\nAs
    for your /g...  I feel like I've already meddled in your design choices far more
    than I should have, but I think the current one is a step backward. It's trying
    to revert to the Baskerville/Meta shape that it originally had, and I don't think
    it's a good match for your font (or for Baskerville and Meta, for that matter).
    The vertical upturn and tiny aperture clash with the \"natural spline\" feeling
    of the similar finials in /a and /s. I'd try to match that feeling by keeping
    the /g's tail low and with relatively little curvature towards the end, much like
    the /s's lower half. If you find that this leaves too large an aperture, maybe
    lower the middle part of the /g a bit to redistribute the weight.\r\n"

    suggested, but haven't reviewed the /g/ and /&/ yet, but I will.\r\n\r\nThis update
    looks at alternative 'shoulders' for the /h/, /n/, /m/ and /u/.  I don't dislike
    the original version, but these letters have been largely untouched throughout
    all iterations and I thought it would be a good idea to at least explore other
    ideas.\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/978940a74f.pdf\r\n\r\nDo these work better,

    flared to the right at the top.  The problem was that this wholly right-leaning

    has a revised /\xDF/, /&/ and /g/.\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/5ef9071c61.pdf\r\n\r\nThe

    bowl is 5% larger to compensate for the space created by a wider opening at the

    modelled on the /s/."

    \ I appreciate all the support you guys have offered.  \r\n\r\nI haven't started
    kerning yet, but I have made quite a few changes since my last update.  These
    include a stronger hood on the /f/; taller ascenders; variations to the acute,
    grave, circumflex and caron for the caps (not visible in the PDF, since it's lower
    case only); and, as a result of Birdseeding's observations, a slightly smaller
    and looser umlaut.  There have been a couple of other small changes too, but I
    forget what they are! :)\r\n\r\nhttp://freepdfhosting.com/0ff63ba208.pdf\r\n\r\nVladimir,
    I should have been busy completing the character set and kerning, but I got distracted.
    \ I was reading another Typophile thread about the tendency to 'Latinise' non-Latin
    scripts, such as Greek, Cyrillic and Arabic.  One Greek contributor to that conversation
    contrasted Latin and Greek by saying Greek was akin to a tango across the page
    whilst Latin was more regimented.   This got me thinking about the way you  described
    this font a couple of weeks ago:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>...as if a breeze is blowing
    through the letters.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo, I wondered if it would be possible
    to create a Greek character set for this 'breezy' font that captured the energy
    of the Greek script without Latinising it.  I've nearly completed the lower case
    characters and will post them here, probably in a new thread, since I want to
    attract native Greek-speakers to comment.\r\n\r\nThen I'll get back to kerning!

  body: Steve. Yes the latest pdf shines. Alas Greek is Greek to me, but I  certainly
    agree with the sentiment against Latinizing Arabic. Can you please point me to
    the Greek discussion you read? All scripts turning to print need to undergo  a
    certain kind of adaptation to account for  modern needs on screen, print, signage
    etc. I call it the Sans Serification whether the 'serifs' are ragged brush endings
    in Japanese script or pen strokes in Arabic. Anyway yes if you have the gumption
    do a Greek set. From my experience however unless you are really knowledgeable
    about the nuances of a script the font will appear 'strange' to native users who
    grew up with the letters. This is true of the Latin I designed for my Arabic  as
    well as of  the Arabic one Mexican  typophile user designed !  The thing I found
    about kerning is that it is not that difficult, and that it really helps a font.

    is right: Using the classic \"optically centered\" method is less ideal when they're
    as steep at this, because it can look as if they are misplaced, sliding off to
    the left. This is especially noticeable with narrow letters like i and with the
    double acute. (Remember, the \xED and the double-acute letters in hungarian are
    \"long versions\" of letters that otherwise bear tittles/umlauts, and a positional
    relationship makes sense.) So carefully moving them right (without leaning the
    whole letter too much) can be a good idea.\r\n\r\nNote: This is not a generally
    standard way of doing it, so feel free to disregard. Btw, much more harmonious
