  in hope to be able pick your brains for knowledge.\r\n\r\nI am currently in my final
  year MA at Central Saint Martins in London and I am designing text typeface that
  I wish be a \u2018sloped roman\u2019. I have been made aware of Stanley Morison\u2019s
  article in The Fleuron number 5 where Morison strongly advocated for its use in
  type family as the 'true' italic. Subsequently I have been trawling through the
  internet to try and find a copy of the article and also all of our schools various
  libraries and I have had no luck with any of them. Very frustrating! I have Walter
  Tracy's book Letter of Credit and he comments and explains Morison\u2019s proposition,
  but would I really like is to be able to read the original copy in its original
  context. I guess the point of this thread is I do any of you fellow typophile\u2019s
  possess a hard copy that could be scanned in and sent to me electronically or know
  a website that I have not come across with it on. I heard it is a fantastic article
  and it would be absolutely brilliant to get hold of it for my project.\r\n\r\nA
  huge thank you in advance for any effort you go to on my behalf.\r\n\r\nTom "
