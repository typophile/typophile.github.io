  in Berlin by [[Erik Spiekermann]] in 1979. \r\n\r\nThe typeface [[Meta]] was originally
  designed for the German Post Office in 1985 and called [[PT 55]], but never introduced.
  It was later redigitized for the studio's own communications, then licensed to [[FontShop
  International]] and exploded into one of the best selling and most used typefaces
  of the 1990s. It is still the best-selling font in the [[FontFont]] library.\r\n\r\nURL:
