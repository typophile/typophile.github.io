<p>We recently agreed with DFi that they need a font for their lines of product. A first attempt of this project was made 10 years ago;
I&rsquo;ve made drafts of some logos, but have to step back the project. One logo was made from these drafts i made, but not finalised by me.
here it is:
<img src="/images/old-images/old-Safe-Mail_4061.jpg" alt="">
This logo had a great success through DFi customers, and they were know for that technology and that logo (&hellip; :-/ )
So the font MUST look like that logo and match the style.</p>
<p>After somes trial, we also agreed that one black font was too heavy to be used alone and must be tempered with a lighter font.
On basis of trials made with Myriad italic, they choose the Black/Standard mix. I tempered thas choice by making a semi-black (or extra-bold, i don&rsquo;t know how to call this) and a slighty bolder standard.</p>
<p>here is the draft of the new SafeMail Logo:
<img src="/images/old-images/safemail03_5599.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished the last letter of the extra-bold font, as it is my first work  of this amplitude, i need all the help i can find!
have all the letter the same boldness, have all the letter the same angle, is the style consistent enough, or whatever looks wrong or unbalanced.
Don&rsquo;t forget that the style of the font is predetermined by the old logo SafeMail.</p>
<p>I join a PDF in file attachment of the extra-bold (or semi-black&hellip;) font. The standard font will come soon to join it.
Any help, any comments are warmly welcomed.</p>
<p>EDIT02: i&rsquo;ve just uploaded 2 new pdf where i&rsquo;ve made some change to the G, J, L and Q in extrabold and reported these changes in the standard.</p>
<p>EDIT03: i&rsquo;ve tempered a bit the waveness</p>
<p>EDIT04: i&rsquo;ve removed the angles</p>
<p>EDIT06: for the black font, i&rsquo;ve have standardized the ascendant of letter, remake the K, modify the Q</p>

<p>Anyway, i know i&rsquo;ve been to &lsquo;generous&rsquo; with the curves and i&rsquo;ve tried to correct it a bit in the V03. Is it enough or still too much wavy (i&rsquo;m affraid of tempering too much because the bold letters have to get into each other and if i temper it too much i will not have materiel to get into the next letter. In a other way the font could be used for small titling and without the bold so i have to correct it anyway)</p>
<p>it could help me to tell me wich letters are the worse and (if any) wich letter is okay</p>

I think if you solve those first two awkward features, the curve of the characters might be acceptable.</p>
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s a weird mix of upper and lowercase characters. Why always a lowercase &ldquo;e&rdquo; and &ldquo;a&rdquo; with everything else uppercase? It makes them look huge.</p>

i had keep them because their was in the original SafeMail logo and was not sure how far i could from it. the &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;e&rsquo; are lowercase because of the same thing, and i know for this point that the client want to keep it this way.</div>

<p>I have hard time to connect the wavy water sport typeface, email, and the umbrella logo. They are a technology email host, and they support water sport, and they want their logo, typeface wavy like water? I think it&rsquo;s better to focus on either technology or water.</p>
<p>I think the typeface so far is great, very watery and wavy. Your client like it, sound like a good thing.</p>

<p>No, i mean right now the client use a combination of Black/Standard Myriad in place of the typo i am in charge to design.</p>
<p>SafeMail (the logo with umbrella) is a elaborate anti-spam &amp; anti-virus system (that&rsquo;s why they wanted a special logo 10 years ago, logo who turns now into a typeface for all their products)</p>
<p>For watersport, DFi is just a sponsor (as you can see on their home page <a href="http://www.dfi.ch">http://www.dfi.ch</a> ) for local ships competition. They want their image to reflect that. At the time i made research for the first logo SafeMail, wavy form sounded original.</p>

Things have moved a lot since my last post. A friend of mine who has a serious background in graphic design told me that my font was too wacky and too unbalanced in general, but the idea was good and original. So he spends some time to explaine me why and some grid technics. i had so many corrections to do, so i decided to start over and be less fantasy this time.
In the good news section, i convinced the client to forget about linking the typo of the bold font (hurray!!)
so there is the new version of the typo, my friend tells me it&rsquo;s look a looot better.
