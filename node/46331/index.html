The old apple rules—everything simple, set in Myriad—were really targeting people who had a taste for clean modernist aesthetics. Breaking out of that box is a sign that Jobs is reaching out to the wider customer base that Apple has picked up in recent years.</div>

<p>I agree with James. Apple is spreading a wider net with this one. Mobile Me strikes me as something much more personal and they had to do something to link to that. It would&rsquo;ve seemed (non)branded if they&rsquo;d left it just Myriad.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m curious Carlo, what specifically makes you hate this logo so much?</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t see much wrong with it. I think it&rsquo;s a very approachable logo, that&rsquo;s still clean with a strong concept. As Nick pointed out &ldquo;Saving to the Cloud&rdquo; and for years, the Internet was always visualized as a cloud, especially in data flow diagrams. It&rsquo;s interesting that Apple took that visual idea and made it more &ldquo;congruent&rdquo; and &ldquo;tangible&rdquo;, instead of this implied empty space that things just &ldquo;happen&rdquo; in. It&rsquo;s now a destination, that seems very welcoming and more importantly, safe. Since you&rsquo;d be relying on it to keep all your important data (contact info, calendars schedules, files&hellip;) there, secure.</p>

<p>honestly it seems to me very unclear. Although I agree with your ideas about the cloud as a destination or a &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo;, its insertion in the logo sounds a bit artificial in my opinion.</p>

<p>You still haven&rsquo;t expressed WHY you don&rsquo;t like it. Other than saying the cloud seems artificial and not very elegant. You&rsquo;re being critical without supporting your criticism.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about the iPhone icons being used in the cloud to represent the various services. I suppose that those are the clearest, most minimal visual representations of those various things within the Appleverse. As for the Web 2.0 comments/complaints, that&rsquo;s really no different than what Apple&rsquo;s been doing for the past decade. My major complaint is that the cloud looks like a collection of bubbles and aqua buttons instead of a cloud. It feels kind of amateurish.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t mind this at all. As others have said, it&rsquo;s distinguishing itself for a new audience. That audience is those under this category: &ldquo;Exchange for the rest of us.&rdquo; (taken from Apple&rsquo;s own mouth) The &ldquo;rest of us&rdquo; means people who want centralized syncing of their devices but aren&rsquo;t IT professionals and just want that convenience at home.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it&rsquo;s a bit fluffy, but it does hit a lot of the right notes, given their goals.</p>
<p>By the way, the cloud image refers to the centralized server that manages all of this cross-device syncing. Apple refers to this as &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;MobileMe stores all your email, contacts, and calendars on an online server — or “cloud” — and pushes them down to your iPhone, iPod touch, Mac, and PC. When you make a change on one device, the cloud updates the others. Push happens automatically, instantly, and continuously. You don’t have to wait for it or remember to do anything — such as docking your iPhone and syncing manually — to stay up to date.&quot;</em></p>

<p>It made me think of that, too. Nice touch, if it was intentional, but kind of obscure. Although they are still using the phrase &ldquo;for the rest of us&rdquo; with this, which goes back to the original Mac debut.</p>

<p>I think James Puckett said it best&hellip; This is no mistake&hellip; They&rsquo;re doing this on purpose, not because they are naïve, but because they are going after a certain look for a certain &ldquo;audience&rdquo; or &ldquo;target&rdquo; (as they say in advertising).</p>
<p>I have problems with design that deliberately dumbs things down, because I think that involves a negative value judgement of others (I feel that it is akin to &ldquo;talking down&rdquo; to someone), but maybe other people have problems with design that tries to educate or elevate, or that simply tries to be well-made or appropriate (maybe &ldquo;good taste&rdquo; is not always &ldquo;right&rdquo;). And I know I&rsquo;m opening a huge can of worms here, because how do you define &ldquo;well-made&rdquo; or &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;? No matter how much theory and objectivity you can come up with, there is always a human being making decisions, be it at the design-decision level or at the money-making level.</p>
<p>Maybe I should give a concrete example. I once designed a book about a professional soccer team, and I wanted to print the cover with a matte finish. When the printer found out, he said, &ldquo;Oh, just make a glossy cover; that&rsquo;s what soccer fans (the audience for the book) are going to go for.&rdquo; (I should mention that this all took place in Argentina, not the U.S., but maybe it is still a valid story.) I ended up having my way with the matte finish, and the book sold well &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think the cover&rsquo;s finish would make it or break it. But that doesn&rsquo;t prove or disprove anything &ndash; it&rsquo;s just one little example, and it bears no comparison to something as massive as the iPhone or .mac accounts.</p>

<p>I think there is little use in being cynical about this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone is consciously trying to be cynical about it. The cynical view is a product of the 20th century, which made mainstream culture cynical.</p>
<p>I was aiming to go beyond cynicism. I was sarcastic and satirical with my list of descriptive words. At the same time I was 90% neutral—the words I chose describe the logo&rsquo;s qualities, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I hate it. It just isn&rsquo;t for me.</p>
<p>The point: Apple are catering to the lowest common demoninator, and that philosophy produces awful design. The same kind of philosophy produces awful industrial design like the Ford Crown Victoria. It&rsquo;s a bad logo, and anyone who defends it as having aesthetic merit is defending bad design and the philosophy of pandering to the lowest common demoninator.</p>
<p>It could also be said that this badly-designed logo reflects Apple&rsquo;s willingness to pollute the world with such banality in pursuit of the almighty dollar, which is not so mighty these days. When I called it &ldquo;visual pollution&rdquo;, I meant it. It looks like rubbish and it stinks. That last bit really is cynical.</p>
<p>I still think they could have captured their target market sector with a more tasteful design. We could be living in a more tasteful world if only marketing people stuck to their job and let designers do theirs properly.</p>

<p>Well, I am a dot.mac subscriber, so when my account is upgraded to MobileMe, I am not going to cancel my subscription or anything.</p>
<p>I think that the service sounds great, and am not perturbed by the icon, which is just the logo/symbol/whatever.</p>
<p>As for the iPhone, I love its design—and the design of almost everything associated with it. I think that I&rsquo;ll get one sometime around November, finally.</p>
