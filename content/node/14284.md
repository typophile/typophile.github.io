body: "Greetings. Quite a few years ago, I picked up a copy of the Windows version
  of Macromedia Fontographer 4.1, complete with printed(!) manual. I'm trying to clean
  out my apartment and I really don't need it now, but i'd love to get it into the
  hands of someone who could make use of it. Rather than put it on Ebay, I thought
  I would be a bit more focused in my efforts to find a new home for it. Make me an
  offer. In a few days, the high bid will have some new old software.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\ncharles\r\ncharlesmcurtis@yahoo.com"
