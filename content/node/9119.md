  gift basket company. Target market is business &#40;realtors, corporate gift giving,
  etc&#41;. Let me know what you think. Thanks. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64838.jpg"

  body: '&#34;ON THE RUN&#34; is too small on the first version. <BR> <BR>I like the
    butterfly on the second version better, but I&#39;m not sure about the dripping
    oranges &#40;at least that&#39;s what they look like to me&#41; on the bottom
    halves of the wings. If you add some weight to where the bottom half of the wings
    connected it might help. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s cute.'

  body: I don&#39;t know about it being the easy or fast answer. The butterfly idea
    was chosen over several concepts that weren&#39;t shown here. The client liked
    the idea of the butterfly because it is like a gift, emerging from the cocoon,
    etc... It sounds like you are critiquing the second layout with the more &#34;realistic&#34;
    butterfly--I did redraw the butterfly in the last item in my post--I agree that
    the more realistic butterfly was too easy and much too complicated for a logo,
    but I think the colour version simplifies and enhances the concept. The wings
    of the butterfly become bows on the box. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m open to criticism on
    this, but I&#39;m not sure I understand where you are coming from. Thanks.

  body: Jeff I like the treatment of the last butterflies but I hate the type. I hate
    letterspacing for no reason. Also ask yourself will it work at the smallest size
    you will use it. I bet ON THE RUN will fall apart. Remember type doesn&#39;t have
    to justify to be a logo.

  body: Good point Daniel. I&#39;ll have another look at that.  <BR> <BR>I do think
    that stylistically &#40;is that a word?&#41; that tracking the letters in all
    caps does help with legibility and it also feels a bit more elegant. It may be
    possible to make &#39;on the run&#39; more solid by not letterspacing it. I&#39;ll
    play around with it.

  body: I like the &#39;butterfly as bow&#39; idea, but the &#39;on the run&#39; concept
    is diminished in your newer versions. What if the butterfly was alighting on the
    upper-left plane of the diamond &#40;box&#41;? So you&#39;d see the &#39;bow&#39;
    from the side rather than from above? It would add some action/dynamics to the
    logo which would conceptually compliment &#39;on the run&#39; while maintaining
    the bow thing. You could also add the ribbon cross back on the box. The top-down
    view reminds me of pinned insects in a museum.

  body: Good idea, Chris. Thanks. <BR> <BR>I have played down the &#39;on the run&#39;
    part of the identity a bit because it sort of cheapens the feel that we are trying
    to create for the company. However, it is there in the name, so I should likely
    do a better job pulling it out.  <BR> <BR>The clientele they are going after is
    corporate and relatively high end. The on the run part is that they are the only
    ones in this market to provide a complete online solution for this service.

  body: I don&#39;t quite get the butterfly. It seems like this would be a flower
    shop or gardening store or something of that nature. But if that&#39;s what the
    client wants... <BR> <BR>How important is the concept of &#39;baskets&#39; with
    this? I wonder if something hinting at the gift basket would make more sense as
    a tagline rather than &#39;on the run&#39;?

  body: The baskets idea is not important. The packages will be delivered in boxes
    or baskets or even bags or crates, it&#39;s just that the industry is called &#34;gift
    baskets&#34; <BR> <BR>Also, &#39;on the run&#39; is not a tagline, it&#39;s actually
    the name of the company.

    it sounds like this is a company that delivers gifts quickly via orders placed
    online.  <BR> <BR>It also sounds like you are being asked to use the name &#39;gifts
    on the run&#39; and an image of a &#39;butterfly&#39;. If that&#39;s the case,
    I think you&#39;ve done a good job.  <BR> <BR>However, you may have troubles with
    the image/type size relationship if this is for online use. I&#39;d probably make
    the type the main visual and much larger in relation to the mark.'

  body: Could the type connote &#34;on the go&#34; more explicitly and then the butterfly
    be used as an accent? As if the butterfly happened to land on the type as it is
    on the go? Am I up in the night?

  body: Thanks for the comments Darrel and Tiffany. <BR> <BR>Darrel, I also have a
    horizontal version for online use which makes the type much larger and more legible.
    <BR> <BR>Tiffany, we had done several versions before the ones I&#39;ve posted
    here that were like that, and the client decided she liked the more stationery
    bow version. I am going to look at &#34;speeding up&#34; the typography a bit
    for the final version though to get that across. <BR> <BR>Thank you all for your
    comments. Much appreciated.

  body: It might just be me, but I don&#39;t think your latest designs say high-end
    gifts. Overall I get the sense of a quickie-mart. Perhaps because there&#39;s
    a local gas station chain called &#34;on the run&#34; and the rounded corner diamond
    box reminds me more of a traffic sign than a gift. I think Chris had some very
    interesting suggestions in his Feb 9th critique. The new placement of the butterfly
    could help emphasize the &#34;gift emerging&#34; concept that brought in the butterfly
    symbol in the first place. And I would also suggest looking at different type
    solutions. The type in your initial posting had a little more of a sophicated
    feel to it. The sans, although easy and clear to read, in it&#39;s current layout
    &#40;justified, and loosely kerned&#41; just seems stuck on. Would it be possible
    to intergrate the type and the mark?
