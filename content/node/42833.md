body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm new to this forum, but as all of you, I've been interested
  in typography for a long time. (maybe not as long as most of you, but I think of
  it as long)\r\n\r\nWhy am I reaching towards you for help?\r\nWell, I've got to
  write a thesis to be able to graduate from my education (Communication & Multimedia
  Design, I'll get to that later on). I want to do a paper on a typography related
  subject, but so far the only thing I've come up with is this:\r\n\r\nCan typography
  change the reaction / emotion a viewer has?\r\n\r\nI'm not quite satisfied with
  it, so I would like to know if anyone has some idea's that could point me in a different
  direction, or could help me redefine my question, prefferably with some resource
  links.\r\n\r\n(I'm not asking you to write my paper for me, that's my job, but a
  hint or advice on a direction would help)\r\n\r\nSo what is Communication & Multimedia
  Design?\r\nCommunication & Multimedia design is a study taught in the Netherlands
  (at least that is where I'm attending). It focusses on combining the new and old
  media whilst creating new and innovating ways of using them. \r\n(the website of
  my education can be found here <a>http://www.cmd-breda.nl</a>, but it's in Dutch.
  And please look through the not so well designed website.)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nVincent
  Delahaije\r\n\r\nP.S. As most of you would've probably noticed; English isn't my
  primary language."

  body: "\"Can typography change the reaction / emotion a viewer has?\"\r\n\r\nHi
    Vincent. That probably needs to be a little more focussed. What is the approximate
    length of the paper? If it's not a sort of thesis then it's better to look at
    typography in a specific industry/application/historic context. \r\n\r\nA few
    stray ideas for whatever they may be worth.  \r\n\r\n1. There are typefaces like
    Clarendon, Century and Gill Sans that are very reminiscent of the British empire.
    Institutions, businesses, publications etc of that period used a lot of those
    faces. The Netherlands too had overseas colonies. Maybe you can access examples
    of typography from that period to see if there was any consistent style. You could
    also examine if it would give any hints on how different nations looked at their
    overseas dominions (benign, domineering, mercantile etc). The VOC monogram of
    the Dutch East India company could be a starting point   \r\n\r\n2. In a time
    when the Latin script is gaining ascendence the world over, it may be interesting
    to look at factors that can influence growth/decline of typography in vernacular
    scripts. Factors like technology, government intervention, chauvinistic politics,
    market pressures etc. You can do this by looking at examples from different countries....
    Across the middle east, government regulations require the use of Arabic. In the
    early 90s the Indian goverment set up a project to design and propogate vernacular
    language fonts primarily to stem the outflow of foreign exchange to overseas foundries.
    You could look at examples from Israel, Thailand, China etc.  \r\n\r\n3. You may
    also find it interesting to look at the evolution of typography in currency notes;
    both in your country and elsewhere. It might reflect the changes in how governments
    have wanted to be percieved over the years: from distant and majestic to today's
    friendly and inclusive. After all curreny notes carry the most ubiquitous form
    of typography and everyone would be familiar with those letters.  \r\n\r\nHope
    some of this may be useful, or at least would spark off useful ideas. "

  body: "First off; to answer your question, writingdesigning, my thesis (It's a small
    one but still) is supposed to be around 5000-8000 words. It isn't much, I know,
    but we've only been granted 10 weeks to write it.\r\n\r\nI think your stray idea's
    are quite interesting. Especially the one about the VOC and the 17th century forms
    of (handwritten) communication. I'll have to go and look into that one. \r\nBut
    I also like the one about typographic elements in currencies.\r\n\r\nMy problem
    with picking a subject is, in my opinion, likely caused by the (way too large)
    number of interests I have. I find too many things too interesting, so I'm always
    looking in the wrong (or to much) direction(-s) to pick a good subject. Thanks
    for your directions!\r\n\r\n"

    (way too large) number of interests I have...\"\r\n\r\nI know just what you mean
    :) But far from being a problem, I think that's crucial asset for a designer.
    You just need to structure your work into two broad stages: the first where you
    allow a lot of play for exploring diverse ideas and the second where you focus
    on just the best of those ideas and take them forward. \r\n\r\nGood luck anyway!\r\n\r\n-\r\nArun\r\n-"

  body: "Maybe a more interesting question would be \"Can a typeface illicit zero
    emotional reaction in the viewer?\"\r\n\r\nI think it's pretty obvious there are
    a lot of typefaces that have a clear emotional message -- fancy scripts convey
    elegance and romance, bold sans serifs convey a no-nonsense bluntness -- but are
    there typefaces that say absolutely nothing, and allow for a completely transparent
    text, where the only thing that matters is the words of the writer? If you've
    seen \"Helvetica\" (the movie), you know this was a major goal of modernist thinking
    in typefaces. To me, there's a much bigger question surrounding the notion of
    a \"neutral\" typeface being possible. "

  body: "FeeltheKern, that's something I haven't thought about, (I'm a bit ashamed);
    flipping the question in the other direction, making it the opposite. I'll look
    into that. And yes I've seen helvetica the movie, but I'm gonna watch it again,
    since my memory of it is a bit blurry.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: 'Since you''re from the Netherlands, maybe the idea of expressive type is
    more interesting, since Dutch type in the 20th century has a history of being
    very neutral. The US, both typographically and culturally, has never been a big
    fan of neutrality, at least for too long. '

  body: "FeeltheKern, do you have any examples of Dutch Type from the 20st Century.
    Because I have to admit that my knowledge of typographical history isn't as large
    as most of yours (and most of the others here) is.\r\n\r\nI love typography, but
    since it's just a minor part of my education, most of its information I have to
    collect myself. And I don't always know where to look."
