  body: "Hrant,\r\n\r\nThe type comes in vector format, it is composed of several
    shades of grey ( 10 + ) to achieve a 3D effect, the images you see in the post
    are actual 3DMax renders made using the vectors as a base.\r\n\r\nRodrigo.\r\n\r\nPS:
    Thank you Chris, I'll take it into account for my next post."

    to do it as a single font, but I might release 2 or 3 combining fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the thread!"
