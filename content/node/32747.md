  body: "There is a very short mention in Christopher Burke's book 'Paul Renner \u2014
    The Art of Typography' on pp 110-1  (and ill's of the Cover and pages of a type
    specimen dated 1928):\r\n\r\n\"Renner himself designed a grotesk bearing some
    similarity to Futura as a display typeface for Stempel. It was called Plak (1928),
    and it was promoted as an accompaniment to Stempel's Neuzeit Grotesk family. This
    seems a strange state of affairs, since Neuzeit-Grotesk was a rival to Futura;
    moreover, Renner was stull very occupied at that time with the second wave of
    Futura, released by Bauer in 1930. Plak was produced as wooden letters from 72
    point to 624 point in size. Being a poster type, it was available exclusively
    in bold weights, but in three width variations. The widest variant bears similarities
    to some of Futura's geometric letterforms, but in the condensed variants, the
    letters necessarily become more grotesk-like ([reference to figures]). Grotesk
    typefaces were developed in the nineteenth century for use at large sizes on posters,
    and Renner realized that grotesk forms were more adaptable than Futura in maintaining
    maximum weight with narrow width.\"\r\n\r\nEnd of quote. Nothing else on Plak
    in this book."

    approx. 12 pages.\r\nBut I lost it behind a cabinet with lead types - may be 500
    kg all together. So: no chance. What a mess :-|\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

    for Conde Nast Portfolio and expanded for Wallpaper:\r\n\r\n\"The heavy end of
    the family is based in part on Paul Renner's Plak, a relatively obscure display
    typeface cut only in large sizes of woodtype, that is related to his heavier weights
    of Futura but has rounder, friendlier, fatter proportions.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://christianschwartz.com/graphik.shtml\r\n\r\nGraphik
