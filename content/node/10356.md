  body: 'This reminds me of a job I did a few years ago. A local specialty technical
    bookshop decided to use base9 as their new identity font: signage, labelling,
    the whole lot. I think they must have been looking only at the individual lettershapes,
    and completely ignored Emigre&#39;s explanation of the concept behind the design,
    because they were mighty shocked when they realised that the <i>spacing</i> of
    the font was based on a coarse resolution bitmap. So first I was called in to
    respace the font and to develop some kerning. Then I was asked to tweak the design
    of some of the glyphs. Then the bookshop went bankrupt.'

  body: 'John, I know what you&#39;re talking about. <BR> <BR>I just finished a magazine
    for EHSAL, Europese Hogeschool in Brussels. They wanted a contemporary yet classical
    yet youthful yet serious look, so I specified <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=124"
    target="_blank"> Tarzana</a> as main body face, with headlines and various bits
    and bobs set in <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=84" target="_blank">
    Cholla</a>. We go through the proposal, design and lay-out stages without any
    problems. Everybody seems quite happy with the redesign. <BR> <BR>Then, as the
    magazine is ready to be sent off to the printer&#39;s, the head of the Hogeschool
    gets the colour prints in his hands, notices the unusual <a href="http://www.emigre.com/TAR/ECAP.php"
    target="_blank"> uppercase E</a> and decides that it makes the name of the school
    look like the Esso logo. To cut a long story short: after a lot of to and fro&#39;s,
    I was told to replace the uppercase E in every mention of the school&#39;s name
    with a regular looking E. As Tarzana has no built-in alternate uc E and I was
    so close to deadline, the only thing I could think of was to over-kern an F and
    an L, hoping that it would end up looking all right... :/'
