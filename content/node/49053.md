    the font\r\nit will say helvetica neue. Instead of Neue Helvetica\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=helvetica\r\n\r\nI
    assume its because of the alphabetical order...\r\n\r\nBy the way...nice stuff

    pandering to the English speakers of the world? :-)\r\n\r\n<em>I\u2019ll never

    know what's just as bad or worse, Jan? Hearing English speakers pronounce \"Neue\"
    exactly the same as \"New\". (Yes, I know I sound like an insufferable snob when
    I say that, but it's true!)"

  body: "Sorry Jeff, I just meant to wish you luck.  Great discussion though.  I wasn't
    aware of the word order controversy.  In French I know they would put the adjective
    second, while technically in English it would come first, so even in English \"New
    Helvetica\" is grammatically correct while \"Helvetica New\" doesn't make sense
    in English.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, let's talk about Jeff's smoking shirts instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://typographyshop.com\r\n"
