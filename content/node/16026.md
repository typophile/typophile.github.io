  body: You have either a Didot or a Bodoni. I'd do a search at one of the typesellers
    like FontFont or MyType. Just type in Bodoni or Didot.

  body: "Based on the 'g', 's', 't', and 'r' I'd say it's either <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bodoni-classico/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Bodoni Classico</a> or <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/bodoni-ef/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Bodoni EF</a>. Either way it's slighlty [[squooshed]].\r\n\r\n
    - Lex\r\n\r\nEdit: Bodoni EF seems closer to me"
