  and decided to do a bit more work on it. As you can see, it's presently only lowercase,
  but I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on whether the design has merits and
  any changes that need to be made.\r\nMany thanks!\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/header_2.png]]"

  body: "Looking pretty nice. A couple of things that stand out to my eye: That lowercase
    r is looking a bit too wide. The m could be wider, the space between f and u in
    Beautiful looks too wide and the right leg on the capital R could be dropped a
    little lower.\r\n\r\nBest of luck with the rest of it!"
