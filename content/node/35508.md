  body: "Yeah, I always like that kind of treatment (if done properly). AFAIR, Optima
    Nova Titling has these kinds of umlauts as alternates. \r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone
    has seen any modern use of a small superscripted \"z\" instead of the cedilla
    in \xE7?\r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Is that the actual way that \xE7 it was written?  From my understanding,
    at least in Spanish from where the letter was derived, it was an alternate way
    of writing the letter <em>z</em> that later got reanalysed as <em>c</em> with
    a squiggle, rather than them having consciously written <em>c</em> with a <em>z</em>
    underneath it in the manner that the <em>e</em> was written above letters.  So,
    really I guess the \"old fashioned\" way to do it would be to have a <em>z</em>
    with a <em>c</em> above :) (kidding of course).\r\n\r\nhttp://medievalwriting.50megs.com/graphics/alphabet/visigothic/visigothz.jpg\r\n\r\nBasically,
    originally it was more or less the contemporary <em>z</em> but with an ascending
    (akin to the flourishes often seen on the <em>7</em> in contemporary handwriting)
    and descending flourish (like in many italic fonts).  Overtime, the ascending
    flourish was reanalysed as a C, with the diagonal and descending flourishes seen
    as a diacritic (excuse the roughness of my example, I did it pretty rapidly):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ztocedilla_4227.png]\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl
