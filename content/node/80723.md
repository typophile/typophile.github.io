  minimal typefaces (Herbert Bayer\u2019s Universalschrift,  New Alphabet by Wim Crouwel...Minimum...etc)\r\n\r\nWhat
  typeface, preferably a sans would work nicely with Di Sciullo's Minimum typeface.\r\n\r\nAnny
  suggestions are more than welcome! \r\n\r\n"

  body: Something narrow (in order to maintain proportions) and round (so to enhance
    Minimum's angularity by contrast).

  body: "Something by <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Test_Pilot_Collective/\">Test
    Pilot Collective</a>.\r\n\r\nYou're in the zone of radical experiments of the
    1990s.\r\nIt's often termed \"deconstruction\", but there was also a lot of very
    modular, orthogonal, vector-drawn work, reinventing the alphabet. New media, new
    typography.\r\n\r\nOf the faces acquired by MoMA, Template Gothic and Dead History
    may be considered deconstructive, but a glaring omission was  Licko and Vanderlans'
    Oblong (1988), the mother of all bitmap-informed neo-constructivist faces.\r\n\r\nLook
    at contemporary issues of Emigre magazine to see an appropriate layout style for
    such types. \"The Cult of the Ugly\" as Steven Heller called it."
