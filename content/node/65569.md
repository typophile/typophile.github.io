body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nMy company is planning to do a reprint of sorts of a historical
  text that was originally printed in 1833 in Missouri. We'll re-typeset it, and we'd
  like to match the original typeface as closely as possible. <!--break-->\r\n\r\nSo,
  question #1: Can anyone recommend some good digital typefaces that look like 19th-century
  serif book fonts? Thus far, the closest I've come is some form of Century, and I'm
  not wild about it.\r\n\r\nQuestion #2: A (non-designer) colleague of mine has a
  contact who has been talking to him about our predicament. The contact has suggested
  that we send him scans of the original, which he will send to some third party company
  who will then create an \"exact match\" typeface from the digital scans. I'm a little
  wary of this approach (not least because the characters aren't always crystal clear
  in the original). Does anyone have experience with this sort of thing? Can you provide
  recommendations?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/|Scotch Modern]] might
    be worth looking at, though it's patterned on a face from later in the century
    IIRC. \r\nCan you post an image to Typophile of the typeface you're trying to
    approximate? I bet good proposals of existing fonts would come from that which
    would be more usable as fonts than some scanned solution."

  body: "Thanks, Craig. Scotch Modern isn't half bad. I think, however, that my serifs
    are a little less Modern, a little more Transitional. Also, I think the stroke
    contrast on my capitals is a little higher. \r\n\r\nA sample is now attached.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BofC%20OC%20page%20006_3843.jpg]"

  body: "Matthew Carter's Miller, although it has unbracketed serifs, is even more
    legible and well-proportioned than Century Expanded. This is good, for why bother
    to set out to make a font with flaws... but that means it doesn't closely resemble
    the typefaces of the bad old days.\r\n\r\nSo it might be that Hercules or Benton
    Modern Display are more like what he is looking for...\r\n\r\nIt's also possible
    that Scotch Modern or Scotch Modern Display, from ShinnType, would work; but Scotch
    Micro, like Miller, avoids the flaws of the old Scotch Romans. It's possible that
    the other versions do as well, and I'm not interpreting the appearance of the
    large specimens properly; the text specimen here\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/\r\n\r\nin
    the sample text starting with \"Recontextualizing\" shows a beautiful, legible,
    and well-proportioned type - a good Scotch Roman instead of a bad one."

  body: "<em>Miller, although it has unbracketed serifs...</em>\r\n\r\nIt doesn't.
    It has subtly bracketed serifs, which is one of the features that makes it easier
    on the eye than more extreme Romantic and Victorian types.\r\n\r\nA common feature
    of many Victorian types is the tightly curled c and e, in which the bottom stroke
    curves upwards almost to touch the part of the letter above. Miller does not do
    this, and nor does the scan of the page provided by \u2018plenipotentiary\u2019.
    In fact, if you compare the proportions and treatment of letters in that sample
    with Miller, you will see that they are quite close; much more so than with Scotch
    Modern, which follows the tightly curled model.\r\n\r\nHere is a comparison, showing
    what I mean. From top to bottom: the scanned book, Miller Roman, Scotch Modern:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cometh_5064.gif]\r\n\r\nOf
    course, Miller isn't a perfect match. Apart from inconsistent details such as
    the top of the t, Miller's heavier weight gives a different overall impression.\r\n"

    Escrow</a>. Again, the details don't match, but they offer a light cut which might
    give the effect you're looking for.

  body: "Regarding the type, one type this reminds me of is Bell. It might be available
    in a digital form. I was fortunate to work at a press in Portland, The Anthoensen
    Press, years ago, and they had a few old original fonts of Bell. It is a very
    nice face of similar style. It might be suitable for your project.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BellMT_6479.png]\r\nThough
    the serifs are not quite as slab like as the original, I don't know, now I am
    thinking the Scotch might be better, or the other imaged above. \r\nScanning and
    using Fontographer is a possibility.\r\nAside from the fact that I am 2 years
    late, the Bell face is a little shown face with unique characters and I could
    only find this peck of a sample. \r\nMaybe I'll dig up a better one just for the
    record. I wonder how this project turned out."
