  body: "Hi there,. \r\n\r\nNot amazing, the font used breaks up when it is in small
    sizes. My be due to the light weight of it, probably needs bumping up to regular.
    I think the leading is far too generous within the body copy. Needs tightening
    a little. The Where Fresh Ideas Grow intro probably needs tighter kerning, the
    letters read almost more as seperate letters rather than words. \r\n\r\nI think
    the kerning within the body copy is ok, its easy on the eye. \r\n\r\nIt is also
    a simple layout which makes it easier to navigate and know where you are which
    is a nice thing. \r\n\r\nOverall its a nice little site, just needs a few tweaks
    here and there. \r\n\r\nM "

    Semillero</a>.\r\nAfter seeing the intro I miss some floral elements that would
    unify the main site with the intro. \r\n\r\n___________\r\nAL\r\nwww.lenart.pl"

  body: "There are plenty of Typophiles who can say much more much better than me
    about your typography.\r\n\r\nBut as an interface designer, I've gotta say it:
    navigation which only functions on rollover (not click) is an absolute disaster.
    I accidentally switched pages on your site every 0.3 seconds, just because I moved
    my cursor. Were I you, I'd think real hard about switching to clicks and ditching
    the rollover gag, esp. since you're presenting yourself as a web designer."

    Squire: Thanks for the ideas, I'll take a look at what I can do.\r\n\r\n@aleksander:
    The client's logo is that leaf shape that was styalized for the intro. But if
    you have any ideas on how to add some more floral elements to the main site I
    would love to hear the!\r\n\r\n@MattB: Frankly I find your remark condesending.
    The clients insisted on having actions occur on rollover so I had no choice in
    the matter. But since we are talking about user friendliness you might want to
    get you company to use a different flash embed method so that there is no click
    to activate on you site ;)"
