    need to use the latest AFDK or VOLT. What you are seeing with \"pos uni0632 uni0622
    <-60 0 -60 0>;\" is FontLabs interpretation of kern lookups for right to left
    kerning.\r\n\r\nTry reading the guiding notes for VOLT and finish your font using
    it."

  body: "You can use FontLab to kern a Right-To-Left (RTL) font, but FontLab will
    not export the kerning in the proper RTL format.\r\n\r\nThe \"pos uni0632 uni0622
    <-60 0 -60 0>;\" you're seeing is the correct kern pair format for RTL scripts.\r\nFor
    LTR scripts the format is \"pos A V <0 0 -60 0>;\" which can be simplified to
    \"pos A V -60;\".\r\n\r\nThe &lt;A B C D> values are:\r\n-- C horizontal advanced
    width adjustment\r\n-- A horizontal position adjustment\r\n-- B and D are for
    vertical adjustments"

    Thanks for this info, but the question now, what should I do to kern RTL in fontlab?How?
    what should I do to generate something like <-60 0 -60 0> ??\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks "

  body: "This is the workflow for kern2volt.\r\n\r\n1. Do your kerning in FontLab,
    using the RTL preview setting in the kern window.\r\n\r\n2. Generate a .ttf font
    containing a) an oldstyle flat (non-OTL) kern table and b) post table glyph names
    that will match your VOLT project glyph names. [Note that if you have used class
    kerning in FontLab you will need to 'flatten' it, i.e. expand the class kerning
    to individual pairs before generating the font with the kern table.\r\n\r\n3.
    Open the font in VOLT and import the glyph names from the post table (this is
    under the Import/Glyph Data menu. Save the font, and then close VOLT.\r\n\r\n4.
    Open a command line window (cmd.exe on Windows), navigate to the directory where
    your font and kern2volt are located (alternatively, if you know how, you can set
    the Windows path variables so that kern2volt can be run from any directory). Run
    kern2volt on the font being sure to use the -rtl option:\r\n\r\n<code>kern2volt
    -rtl myfont.ttf</code>\r\n\r\n5. kern2volt will produce a .vtl format VOLT GPOS
    lookup file containing your kerning. Note that kern2volt will have compressed
    your expanded kerning into ad hoc groups for maximum efficiency based on shared
    kerning values.\r\n\r\n6. At this stage you generally want to generate a new .ttf
    font from FontLab *without* the oldstyle kern table. Open this new font in VOLT
    and import the .vtl generated by kern2volt. Assign this kerning lookup to the
    'kern' feature for the Arabic script/language tags.\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong>
    if you have kerning for Arabic numerals as well as Arabic letters, you will need
    two separate FontLab kerning sources, one for RTL kerning and one for LTR kerning
    (obviously also true if you have a multiscript font that contains e.g. Latin glyphs
    as well as Arabic). Follow the above steps for each kerning set, running the LTR
    kerning through kern2volt without the -rtl option."
