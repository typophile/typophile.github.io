    for [[http://www.hapticarchitects.co.uk|Haptic Architects]]. Not sure it has ever
    been a font, rather a custom logo work. Wasn't able to spot any blocky full-lined
    font like this one. That'd probably even easier to recreate it by yourself as
    it's \"only\" made with lined basic geometric shapes (rectangle, triangle, circle...).\r\nSome
    lined fonts you may like though: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/signal/vibro|Vibro]],
