  I am very interested to get anyone's thoughts on it.\r\nI could do with some fresh
  eyes really. I'm not sure about the type yet, whether it'll be all caps etc.\r\n\r\n

  body: "I like how you've handled the wording, but the main logo seems lacking.\r\n\r\nIt
    looks half-way inbetween a blackletter 'r' and a house, and the \xB0 symbol looks
    like a sun?\r\n\r\nI think you either need to make it a house with a \xB0 symbol,
    or else make it an 'R'.\r\n\r\nThe thought of that symbol though, a house or R
    with a \xB0 is a wonderful and genius idea, take it right to the bank, that's
    the money-maker right there.\r\n\r\nI wanna see more work on it and have it resolved
    better because it's not that often that a concept with that potential comes along.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    it's very \u2018paul rand\u2019 in it's simplicity and clarity of message"

    very much for your quick comments. It started as just the 'R' with \u02DA symbol,
    but I wasn't sure if when used on its own whether it would be relevant to property.
    \r\nI'm glad you think it has potential to work, I was starting to wonder if the
    message was clear enough   \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3828.jpg]"

  body: "I'd make it the same 'R' as you have in the logotype, whatever you choose
    that to be.\r\n\r\nRight now if I just saw the house/R I wouldn't recognize it
    as either an 'r' or a house.\r\n\r\nIf you have a red R\xB0 I think people will
    see R....red degrees hot?  oh, Redhot!  of course!\r\n\r\nI think once they know
    the name there's enough information in R\xB0 to convey that whole thought.\r\n\r\nJust
    for fun though, had you at any point tried red\xB0 or Red\xB0?  I know it's close
    to that stupid retard(red) campaign, but I think it could work as a viable alternative
    to help you keep some options open - and who knows, maybe you can develop that
    too and see if that does allow you any freedom R\xB0doesn't (although it might
    be more limited too, you never know)\r\n\r\nI wanna see more!"
