  body: Is there any reason you believe this is a font, and not artwork? Have you
    ever seen any other letters?

  body: I believe Mike is right - it&#39;s quite possible this is a custom designed
    logo.

  body: I just thought there could be something similar out there,  <BR>I haven&#39;t
    seen any other characters... it probably is just a custom  logo, thanks for your
    help

  body: Isaac, it is reminisent of Western Style font &#40;US&#41; maybe its based
    on one of those. I don&#39;t know if Mike has a Western Style font page but you
    might ask him.
