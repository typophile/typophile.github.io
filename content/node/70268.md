body: "I am looking for suggestions for an script font to use in a design that requires
  a Latin flavor.  I wanted to at least give Kimura Type's Lagarto a try, but I sent
  an email through their website weeks ago and never heard anything back--and can't
  find another retailer for that font.  Something kind of \"scripty\" or simply with
  a hand-penned look would probably work well in the design.\r\n\r\nI know this is
  kind of a broad request, but using Lagarto as a yardstick, are there any suggestions
  on alternate typefaces that I could use to get a similar vibe?"
