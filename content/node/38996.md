body: "I look through hundreds of these things in an average week, and I can't count
  the number of times I end up reading something like the following, which absolutely
  cracks me up every single time:\r\n\r\n\"Typography is a critical element of (Business
  X), because usually it is the very first thing our customers see about us. We are
  a modern, cutting edge firm fully cognizant of the crucial part a vibrant, consistent
  look plays on the path to success. In seeking to reflect this company's unique,
  progressive philosophy, and after careful consideration, only one typeface fit our
  vision: Arial.\"\r\n\r\nNot sure about you, but to me this is both amusing and an
  immediate assurance that whatever the business is, I'm not likely to be a patron."

    a well hinted screen font installed 'for free' on every Mac, Linux and Windows
    computer made in the past ten years. \r\n\r\nIf these guys were to say, \"we picked
    Arial because our graphic designers and marketing people couldn't come up with
    convincing enough arguments to make us spend a few thousand bucks on fonts\" would
    you have more respect? "

  body: I work on a few major corporate accounts at work. The official font of GM
    Goodwrench is Myriad. The official Microsoft Canada font is Segoe, which is a
    weird Tahoma/Frutiger/Myriad face.

  body: "sii:\r\n\r\nI will ALWAYS have more respect for the truth than anything less
    than the truth, regardless of the circumstances. Next question.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    something even better to say would be: \"For our corporate typeface we've chosen
    Arial, a well-hinted screen font widely available and compatible with nearly every
    known operating system.\" But after being told how dynamic and forward-thinking
    a company is, and how dedicated it is to having a standout visual program, it
    just strikes me as funny when these places say the typeface that matches their
    philosophies is Arial. Or Times New Roman.\r\n\r\nTo me it's almost like a company
    is saying, as a dynamic, progressive business with employees spending large amounts
    of time on the road, we believe our company cars should be distinguishable from
    every other car, fitted with the best safety and technological features of the
    present day. They also must be attractive to look at. For that reason, all of
    our company cars are 1991 Honda Civic four-doors. To me that's just funny."
