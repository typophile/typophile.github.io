  Pro Display Light at 150 pts. I wonder what happened to the left stem of the capital
  h!

  body: It looks normal <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond-premier/lt-disp/glyphs.html#glyphs/505858/41">here</a>.
    It might be a rendering problem in your software. Did the glyph look equally strange
    at other sizes and in other applications?

  body: The capital H looks strange only in the Light Display weight, set at any size,
    and in different applications (Indesign, Photoshop, Text Edit). I wonder if anybody
    else who owns the font could test it.
