    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m certain they&#39;d comp something together for you. I don&#39;t
    know what they&#39;ll charge you for it :D

  body: Can&#39;t you draw those kind of characters yourself?  <BR>Not to belittle
    the quality of House&#39;s designs, but  <BR>I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be very
    hard to obtain a satisfying  <BR>result.

  body: Sometimes I get the impression that we rely too much  <BR>on the computer.
    When I was at the Academy I bought  <BR>the book about Terry Jones, art director
    of ID-magazine,  <BR>and it was pure joy to see all these hands-on punk  <BR>techniques
    applied in his magazine lay-outs. Very  <BR>inspiring. Made me think.
