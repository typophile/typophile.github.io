body: would like to get some comments on how anybody think of the topic above. does
  anybody believe in it yourself ? logic and intuition plays an important role in
  how you use typography in your design. this is of quite a difference in how you
  choose typefaces &#60;- this is not what i m saying.thx

  body: Logic and intuition are largely opposed, but they&#39;re both important. Few
    people have both, and if they do, one tends to be suppressed due to social circumstances.
    <BR> <BR>Dwiggins had great intuition, but a lack of logic caused him never to
    make a better font than his first &#40;Electra&#41;. Some people make very good
    revivals, but couldn&#39;t make an original design &#40;which requires intuition&#41;
    if their life depended on it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: '&#62; Electra was Dwiggins&#39;s second font. <BR> <BR>I meant text font.
    It was his first there, right? <BR> <BR>&#62; I think you take out of context
    <BR> <BR>How so? He said something like &#34;it&#39;s interesting what little
    role extenders play in legibility&#34;, and he certainly wasn&#39;t advanced enough
    &#40;in that realm&#41; to even differentiate between legibility and readability.
    Pure blasphemy. <BR> <BR>&#62; merely reaching a wrong conclusion? <BR> <BR>Any
    type designer &#40;after Javal&#41; isn&#39;t taking things seriously when he
    thinks x-height is all that matters. Conclusions derive directly from understanding,
    and not having understanding is largely one&#39;s own fault. But since Dwiggins
    didn&#39;t seem to have the mettle for it, maybe it was excusable? The problem
    in his case was that: <BR> <BR>&#62; how do you think this &#42;caused&#42; <BR>
    <BR>Because intuition is a fragile thing, very easily crushed by the more tangible
    formal logic. Logic has to respect intuition; even when the logic is sound, it
    can end up subverting intuition to the point of sterility; and when it&#39;s flawed
    logic &#40;like WAD&#39;s&#41;, the result is gradual degradation, like Caledonia.
    He needed more time - like Gill. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: <i>&#62;I meant text font. It was his first there, right?</i> <BR> <BR>Yes,
    you&#39;re right about that. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;How so?</i> <BR> <BR>Because he
    was talking about increasing legibility in a 7-point design &#40;&#34;I am just
    cuckoo enough to be intrigued by this problem of getting a thundering big character
    on a 7-point body&#34;&#41;. Would you not agree that larger x-heights and shorter
    extenders become more important in sub-reading sizes, below 8 point? Dwiggins
    said, &#34;It is surprising how little descenders and ascenders have to do with
    &#42;legibility&#42; as such.&#34; [WAD&#39;s emphasis]. That &#34;as such,&#34;
    I think, is an important qualifier in this context. In Gerard Unger&#39;s <i>Quaerendo</i>
    article, noting differences of opinion on this matter, he said, &#34;Personally,
    I go along with Dwiggins.&#34; Will you now declare Unger to be also lacking in
    logic? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not arguing here that extenders don&#39;t play an important
    role. I think Dwiggins may indeed have underestimated this. But you seem to consistently
    overplay the importance of this one statement, taking it out of the context of
    small sizes and parading it out as if it summarized Dwiggins&#39;s whole theory
    of readability, or some such, and then declaring that therefore he must not have
    taken type design seriously. <BR> <BR>&#40;As I re-read WAD&#39;s original letter,
    I do see that he makes some connection between this observation of the newsface
    and his interest with uncial forms. And I will concede that I think this latter
    obsession was misguided and distracting.&#41; <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, I do not
    think that it is fair to say that Dwiggins didn&#39;t think extenders played an
    important role and &#42;therefore&#42;, <i>ipso facto,</i> he was not logical.
    That&#39;s a big leap. It seems to me like saying that Newton was lacking in logic
    because he insisted that light was a particle. <BR> <BR>&#62;Any type designer
    &#40;after Javal&#41; isn&#39;t taking things seriously when he <BR>&#62;thinks
    x-height is all that matters. Conclusions derive directly from <BR>&#62;understanding,
    and not having understanding is largely one&#39;s own <BR>&#62;fault. But since
    Dwiggins didn&#39;t seem to have the mettle for it, maybe <BR>&#62;it was excusable?  <BR>
    <BR>&#42;Sigh&#42;. Hrant, this seems unnecessarily defamatory. Why must you always
    be so polemical? So you disagree with some of Dwiggins&#39;s thoughts; so you
    don&#39;t think he ever designed anything to best his first text typeface -- can&#39;t
    you just leave it at that? Why must you attack his character?  <BR> <BR>It seems
    to me that Dwiggins was one of the more &#42;thinking&#42; type designers of his
    era, exploring ideas, examining and analyzing. The fact that he did not always
    draw the same conclusions as you should not mean that he lacked logic or the &#34;mettle&#34;
    for understanding. <BR> <BR>The fact that he was not able to embody some of his
    theories about type into a successful design should not necessarily diminish the
    value of his thinking about type. &#40;Beware, lest the same charge be levelled
    at you.;-&#41; <BR> <BR>-- K.

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not basing my view of him on that one statement. And there&#39;s
    no such thing as &#34;illogical&#34; &#40;except in the formal realm, of which

    <BR>Because it&#39;s educational. As long as an attack is not motivated by ill
    will, it&#39;s OK - it&#39;s constructive. The attacked simply needs to have the
    maturity to withstand it. <BR> <BR>&#62; Dwiggins was one of the more &#42;thinking&#42;
    type designers of his era <BR> <BR>With this I agree. That&#39;s one reason I
    like him. The other reason is his staggering intuition, of which I can only be
    envious. The M-Formula is nothing short of real genius. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    Hrant always insists on attacking peoples&#39; character because he is a deeply
    insecure individual who needs to make himself feel superior to others. Perhaps
    because his own flaws are so deeply embedded in his personality, he&#39;s become
    convinced that all flaws are flaws of personality; so if someone disagrees with
    him it must be because that person is &#39;psychologically weak&#39; or has some
    similar fault of character. This is why his hermeneutics are always so wide of
    the mark: he never considers that the other person might <i>not</i> be pathological,
    let alone that the other person might be at least partly correct, or correct within
    the context that Hrant ignores to impose his own context. Note that none of this
    is intended as an attack on Hrant&#39;s own character. Even if it were, I hope
    he has &#39;the maturity to withstand it&#39;.'

    the same results. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s important is the transmission of the technique
    afterwards. If your product is based on pure intuition, you&#39;re probably going
    to have to take on a very bright apprentice and show him/her how you work. With
    a lot of observation and experience they might pick it up, if they&#39;ve got
    the mettle. With a product based on purely logical reasoning, you should be able
    to write it all down and teach it to 500 kids in an amphitheatre. <BR>In my very
    humble opinion, I think good type design &#40;like most things&#41; is a healthy

    design, before the Winchester. Neither of these was completed. The Winchester
    was completed, along with a conventional roman and italic, but never released
    to the trade. Fonts of Winchester were cast for hand-setting and used by Dwiggins
    and Dorothy Abbe at their P&uuml;terschein-Hingham press for several books, mostly
