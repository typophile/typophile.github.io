  making it aside from you and the pub's sales rep who is breathing down your neck.
  I try and explain it to my parents or my girlfriend or my dog. They don't get it.
  They're all, \"Ya good job\" but really they have no idea of the mental anguish
  I've been putting myself through. First off you get the call from the publication.
  \r\n\"It was due yesterday\" they say very casually at first then gradually more
  towards screaming obscenities over the next 25 times they call. They don't care
  that your job sheet says it's due next fall, or that your spinal meningitis is boiling
  up, or that your AE is a drunken football hooligan who just threw your computer
  into your windshield when you asked him to \"work on an extension\". \"It was Due
  yesterday, and the page in question goes to press in 15 minutes\" Next, in a frantic
  state of rage and shame and overwhelming hunger you dial every number you can think
  of, the client, the client's assistant, your boss, your Auntie Ella, the kid who
  works at that spot down the way that sells those little jalepeno cheese joints-you
  know the one's, and they all say the same thing \"call you back in 15 minutes\".
  Now it's go time for real, you run outside, jump through your nonexistent windshield
  en route to the only place at which this runaway train can be stopped-The press.
  You get there soaked in sweat mumbling senseless babel to the press operator. He
  doesn't understand your chatter and refuses to stop anything so you make that split-second
  decision and hurl your now limp and unattractive body into the press ending the
  foray in one spectacular display. Unfortunately it was a digital press and instead
  of killing you it merely bruises your face and neck a bit. You return to your office
  defeated and alone. Horrific as it may seem, I live this reality monthly, maybe
  even bi-weekly, and it's fo' serious. DEAD-Lines make hero's and break lesser men/women
  into sweaty little bits of men/women and thats the trail we tread.  "

  body: Nice rant. :) I was drawn in by the sense of anticipation created by the possessive
    apostrophe in the title. "The deadline's what?!?"  Happy friday.
