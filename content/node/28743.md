body: "In FL5 (Mac Version for me), one of the fonts I am working on has developed
  a strange habit. A light blue line ghost suddenly appears when I move a line segment.
  \ I find it annoying.  I assume it is a \"feature\" that some people like. I have
  never purposely turned it on and would like to know how to turn it of before it
  drives me crazy.  I tried preferences but can't seem to  find it or figure out what
  it might be called--perhaps \"The Blue Shadow of Christmas Past\"?\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    editing". Personally, I like this feature, but it's nice that you can turn it
    off if you want to.

    line under the segment you are moving temporarally.  The blue line I am talking
    about is always there.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    in the way.  There are three layers of lines to look at, the mask layer, the glyph
    layer, and this blue line that plagues you like a street pedlar in New York.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "No, it is not an MM, I know what that looks like. This blue line appears
    to be the original position an object was in when pasted or drawn. When you move
    the object, this blue ghost remains even after you deselect.  If I try to select
    the blue line by double-clicking on it, the original path jumps back to become
    the blue line and the blue line then moves to where the original was after editing!
    If I delete the blue line, my original path also gets deleted.  Making me crazy.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
