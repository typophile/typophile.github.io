  doesn't want the very long E-mail and URL addresses to be hyphanated. I can't set
  them in a smaller size and they will obviously not shorten their addresses. Is there
  a miracle solution?\r\n\r\nBy the way I've seen in Dot dot dot magazine that they
  encapsulate URLs in &lt; &gt; symboles. Just like this  &lt;www.dot-dot-dot.nl&gt;.
  Is this a typographic standard?"

    url's \u2014 in the same way as underscoring. \r\nBut I do think it's an elegant
    solution to your problem. The only thing that could be bothersome is hyphenation:
    I think that's undesirable (could be confusing!), so don't use it and doublecheck
    all url's in your text before going to print..."

    applications used the bracketing with greater/lesser than as a way to automate
    creating links from URLs in text. This is less of an issue now since most apps
    are smart enough to make links on the fly.  In printed documents, the advantage
    is that you know the beginning and end.  This does not help your problem when
    you have long URLs.  The only solution is using one of the phonebook fonts (perhaps
    Telefont) which are designed for use at small sizes.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    from the URL - check first that the server can cope with short URLs eg. 'typophile.com'
    because it can sometimes be a problem.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't really help with email
    addresses though... make sure you don't hyphenate them, your client won't thank
    you for it!\r\n\r\nSi"

    the family...\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is practical, but it looks like practical
    and your project aren't coinciding so much. I assume you've already tightened
    the tracking (within reasonable limits)."

    \r\nAs Hrant suggested I tried to insert a <em>logical not</em> to break E-mails
    and URLs. I am having a few problems:\r\n<ol><li>the text is justifed and that
    means it is hyphenated. How do I get rid of the hyphen and replace it with the
    logical not?</li><li>when I inster a logical not at the end of a sentence, the
    sentence doesn't break in the right place. The sentence either moves forward or
    backward. What is it that I am doing wrong appart from being a obvious beginner?</li></ol>"
