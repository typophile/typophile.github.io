body: "Hey guys,\r\n\r\nHere is the first look of the typeface i am creating. Only
  caps done. No character spacing done and you can forget about kerning. Just wanted
  some feedback.\r\nIssues:\r\n The thickness of strokes of V, W, X, Y is to be increased.\r\n
  S can do better with some more tweaking.\r\n And the inner curves of characters
  like B, C, O, Q are not perfectly circular(for the lack of better term) and look
  jagged.( I have no idea how to change it).\r\n\r\nPlease inform me if you have any
  other issues...\r\n\r\nUpdate: The problem of jagged text is more pronounced when
  using at pt size of 36. The other point sizes also give text which is not very smooth.
  Why?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nT\r\n"

      you talking about the letters that have problems( 2nd PDF) or all letters including
      L, M etc. I didn't understand the term wobbly. How can L by wobbly?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nT"
