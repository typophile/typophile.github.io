body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI tried asking this question over at the FontLab forum, but
  there doesn\u2019t seem to be very much activity there, so I\u2019m trying here
  as well. Apologies in advance if this question has been asked before \u2013 at any
  rate I have not been able to find an answer in the archives.\r\n\r\nI am developing
  a font which includes a large number of glyphs in the Private Use Area. For these
  I would like to use my own names, primarily because many of them have alternate
  forms accessible through aalt, stylistic sets etc. Coding would get much easier
  if I could use semantic names rather than \u201CuniExxx\u201D, especially in case
  I want to change the Unicode index of a glyph (each time I do that, I have to track
  down every reference to that glyph in the code and change the name).\r\n\r\nProblem
  is, when I use my custom names the OpenType features stop working, and InDesign
  gives the glyph names as &lt;null&gt;.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to get custom names
  to work? If this has been answered before, kindly point me in the right direction.
  I read somewhere a comment to the effect that \u201Csometimes it works, sometimes
  it doesn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t know why\u201D.\r\n\r\nOh, and I know custom characters
  should not always be in the PUA. Suffice to say, I want them there in this particular
  font.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nM\xE5ns"

    Yes, I noticed that little handy feature. That's one problem less. Unfortunately
    it's not the main problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nYour choice of names should have

    when I change the name, aalt substitution stops working. When I change it back
    it starts working again. (And it is not because the name is not changed in the
    code; the font compiles with no errors.)\r\n\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nI'd use whatever

    (in CS3) gives the PUA glyphs name along the line of \"&lt;private use area-Exxx&gt;\",
    except my renamed glyphs which are named \"NULL\"."

  body: "Adam, I was reading sloppily the first time I saw your post. Reading it again
    I understand what you mean. What I have done is generally to <em>not</em> give
    Unicode numbers to alternates, just the original glyph. My current scheme is to
    have glyphs with names like \"uniE000\" (and Unicode index E000), and alternates
    with names like \"uniE000.alt1\" (no Unicode index).\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons
    I would rather like to use names like \"meaningful\" and \"meaningful.alt1\" (but
    with preserved index for the \"meaningful\" glyph). Unfortunately, this is where
    the problems start. Any idea why?\r\n\r\n/M\xE5ns"

    \r\n\"anything\" or \"anything.ANYTHING\" will map back to an unknown glyph. \r\n\r\nSo
    if you employ your own encoding scheme (say, for a private language), you typeset
    some text in a text editor, produce a PDF, copy the text from PDF and paste it
    again into the text editor, you will get the same text (without alternates or
    formatting, but at least the text) if you use the glyphnames \"uniE000\" or \"uniE000.ANYTHING\",
    but you MAY get a string of undefined characters if you use the glyphnames \"anything\"
    or \"anything.ANYTHING\". \r\n\r\nThe reason why I wrote \"MAY\" rather than \"will\"
    is explained in detail in this thread: \r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/29469#comment-404691\r\n(PDF-compatible
    glyphnames is the magic term). \r\n\r\nAdam"

    </cite>\r\n\r\nAs I said earlier, I don't think that the problem you are having
    with your code not working is related to the naming issue here -- or at least
    I've never run into a problem where particular glyph names prevent features from
    working. I think this is probably a separate issue. If your (non-working) code
    is relatively small, you might want to post it here.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Adam, thanks for the link to that thread, it explained a lot!\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9,
    after a lot of experimenting I can conclude that you were right. For some reason,
    FontLab decided to discard the Unicode index from my renamed glyph each time I
    exported an OpenType font, and instead insert the \"space\" glyph (of all things)
    in that position. (Probably some other problems arose behind the curtain, since
    the OpenType features stopped working at the same time.) I solved the problem
    by right-clicking on the glyph and selecting \"More>Remove Unicode\", then reapplying
    the Unicode index to the glyph that was meant to have it.\r\n\r\nThanks to you
    both for all support and suggestions.\r\n\r\nM\xE5ns"

  body: "Andi,\r\n\r\nno, this portion of .nam will cause that A.ss01 will get the
    Unicode U+0041 if you do \"Generate Unicode\", and A will also get that Unicode,
    and you'll get conflicts. In a font, only one glyph should exist out of those
    which have the same Unicode in a .nam file. Basically, what you're showing is
    that if your font has A.ss01 and no A, and you'll do \"Generate Unicode\" and
    then \"Generate Names\", then your A.ss01 will be renamed to A. Which I don't
    think is what you want.\r\n\r\nDo not put any glyphs that should be accessed through
    OpenType Layout features into the .nam file. The .nam file specifies glyphnames
    that should have Unicodes, and glyphs that have Unicodes are accessible directly
    through the \"cmap\" table, without OpenType Layout.\r\n\r\nAll glyphs that are
    accessible though OpenType Layout features should only be specified in the OpenType
    Layout feature definitions (OpenType panel and perhaps Classes panel).\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
