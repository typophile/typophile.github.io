body: "Hello, I am very puzzled. I have created my font, including open type features
  (contextual and alternative styles). When I view the font in Illustrator Glyph panel
  (entire font list), I cannot see the very last glyph, which happens to be a contextual
  style. But everything functions as it should be, and viewing the glyphs with just
  the styling alternatives I can see the missing glyph. It's just not appearing when
  viewing the entire glyphs. Is this an Illustrator problem?\r\n\r\nI have viewed
  the font in InDesign, and everything is fine here.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be appreciated\r\nTabbycat"
