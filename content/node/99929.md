  Wherever the font is used on the MyFonts webpage \u2014 both in the font sample
  windows and on my foundry page \u2014 neither the kerning nor the ligatures work.\r\n\r\nFrom
  the website:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web_6738.png]\r\n\r\nOn my local
  machine, in PowerPoint:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/powerpoint_6420.png]\r\n\r\nAny
  idea why that would happen?  And how to counter it?\r\n"

  body: "Kerning and standard ligatures should work fine. Some more complex OpenType
    substitutions aren't handled properly yet (particularly anything involving ignore
    subs, such as end forms and certain contextual substitutions). If you're on the
    staging site, make sure 'full OTL' is checked in the menu that drops down from
    the cog. That may or may not help. If it doesn't, the myfonts team are very helpful.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Dave,\r\n\r\nchecking the full OTL box doesn't help.  In any case, the
    \"Standard Ligatures\" box was checked already, so I have no clue why they don't
    work. Also, the kerning should be \"always on\" as far as I can tell, so no reason
    it shouldn't work.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are no such control boxes for the foundry
    name set in Octant (above), so I have to rely on that working properly on its
    own.\r\n\r\nIs there any \"rookie mistake\" that comes to mind that could have
    this effect?\r\n\r\nI have contacted MyFonts; lets see what they say."

  body: "Wait \u2014 could it be related to this error message I'm getting when exporting
    the font OTF?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/error_4281.png]\r\n\r\nI
    always assumed this would only affect the characters with non-standard encodings
    (such as the T_h ligature). Could it be that this error screws up kerning in general?\r\n\r\nShould
    I delete all non-standard characters from the kerning tables...?"

  body: I've never had any trouble with unencoded glyphs in kern feature. I've looked
    at your font page, and the drop down menu that controls OpenType features (should
    be in between black and white squares and cog) is not there. This is probably
    at least part of the problem you're having. Whether it's a problem with the font
    or myfonts page, I don't know.

  body: OK, I've been told by the support contact of the Glyphs software that the
    lookup tables of my OTF files are damaged.  I've received the metrics information
    in tabular form from Igino, and hopefully the Glyphs contact will be able to import
    them into font. We'll see if that works!

  body: "Octant includes AAT features (morx and feat tables) rather than OpenType
    Layout features (GSUB, GPOS). Also, the \"kern\" table is in class-based AAT format.
    \r\n\r\nAAT features (including the AAT-only class-based version of the \"kern\"
    table) only work on Mac OS X and iOS. They don't work on Windows, or in Adobe
    apps, or on MyFonts. \r\n\r\nHas the font been generated using FontForge? It has
    some AAT support. You need to generate the font as \"OpenType for Windows\" in
    FontForge, or something like that, rather than \"TrueType for Apple\". The font
    will then have OpenType Layout features included. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nMyFonts"

  body: "Hi Adam,\r\n\r\nthanks for your help!  Indeed, the problem seems to be that
    I've been using FontForge.  :P\r\n\r\nI have been in contact with Rainer from
    the Glyphs support team now, and he's managed to convert my font into Glyphs and
    re-import Igino's metrics. I've recreated OTF files from the Glyphs file now,
    and I believe those should work well.  I'm uploading them right now.\r\n\r\nCheers"
