body: "The sample is from a 1977 copy of Goeorge Orwell's 1984, published by HARCOURT
  BRACE INTERNATIONAL.\r\n\r\nThe closest I have found is Pall Mall RR Light, but
  Pall Mall RR Light was designed by Steve Jackman in 1992. Years after the book was
  published.\r\n\r\nAny help identifying, would be greatly appreciated."
