  apparently used in the masthead of the London Times (see <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/TGD/slideshow/0,,12-1523,00.html\">here</a>).
  Anything would be helpful, as I don't even know the designer or foundry.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRichard"

  body: Thanks, but I'm not referring to most recent design. The typeface I'm interested
    in seems to have been used from 1951 to 1966 (again see <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/TGD/slideshow/0,,12-1523,00.html">this
    link</a>). Sorry if I wasn't clear enough.
