<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Erik Spiekermann alerted me to <em>Computer Arts'</em> latest feature <a href=http://www.computerarts.co.uk/in_depth/features/type_of_our_times>"Type of our times"</a>, which makes some major misstatements. Perhaps there is no byline for a reason?
<em>"In 1956, the Haas Type Foundry commissioned Max Meidinger to redesign Akzidenz-Grotesk, to make it more legible to modern applications. The result was Haas Neue Grotesk, which the foundry’s owner renamed Helvetica in 1960. This was followed shortly thereafter by Meidinger’s Univers. Helvetica went on to become the most in-demand font for near 20 years."</em>
Oops. Spiekermann's letter to the editor:
<ol><li>The man was called Miedinger; he may only have been a foreigner, but we also like our names spelled properly</li>
<li>Neue Haas Grotesk was a redesign of (surprise!) Haas Grotesk, which in turn was partly based on Scheltersche Grotesk from Schelter & Giesecke -- in those days, type was also quickly assimilated, copied, emulated, ripped-off; the success of Akzidenz Grotesk had alerted Haas to the fact that they were missing sales because all the Swiss designers were specifying AG from Germany.</li>
<li>The name Helvetica was coined by a salesman -- Heinz Eul -- at D. Stempel AG, a foundry in Frankfurt who didn't want to market a typeface with a name like Neue Haasche Grotesk. Credit for the invention of the name later went to Eul's boss, Schultz-Anker, the MD of Stempel (in case you wondered: i have the original correspondence about the name)</li>
<li>Univers was designed in 1957 by Adrian Frutiger, while working for Deberny & Peignot in Paris.</li></ol>
I post this not just to poke a bit of fun, but because the details of typographic history are known to so few, it's important that a major design publication gets them right, or they can quickly get lost. <em>Computer Arts</em> quoted me later in the article, but failed to get the name of my blog right.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Props to Computer Arts Projects for doing such a comprehensive typography special issue.
I have to agree that the Type of Our Times was a bit wack, but it wasn't the Helvetica details that bothered me, but the Modernist perspective. The history of type culture is not Bauhaus, Dada, Constructivists, etc. But this fault is widespread in design history, exemplified in Phillip Meggs <em>History.</em>
For an English perspective, it's like you're travelling through vast pre-war suburban estates of mock-Tudor semi-detached homes, to get to a 1930s international style mansion at the end of a lane.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The same article is featured in "Computer Arts Projects" #086 which also have another good article about Erik himself!. The wholw magazine is about typography, so it is not to be missed by most of the people around here. I myself was asked to make a tutorial... how to create a classic typeface.
I think the general problem with being misquoted etc, is because of the tight deadlines. They don't have the time or staff to read through the the copy enough before printing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>A little off topic, admittedly (for which I apologize):
Computer Arts do seem to trip themselves up a bit sometimes. The "Summer 2006" issue (#126) had a nice marquetry effect cover design (teamed with a Photoshop tutorial inside), but touted it as "woodcut effects"... er, no. Oddly, the same month's issue of Creative Review does actually have a woodcut on the cover.

How is this Meggs fault? I'm curious.
Computer Arts has been doing an annual type issue, though the focus hasn't been quite this historical before. There isn't a really good reference for 20th century type history other than the Lawson so maybe they couldn't check the facts.

<div class=commentbody>One persistent problem is the stigma that formal publications seem to feel in consulting informal groupings of aficionados (mingled with experts like Erik) such as Typophile. Instead of tapping into the lightning-fast public expertise <cite>before</cite> the stuff hits the fan, they tend to pretend such resources don't exist, sometimes even seeing them as an enemy.

<div class=commentbody>I think you're right - but whereas some writers fear the blogosphere (or whatever you want to call it) and would never consult with it, others seem to embrace it. In that particular CAP issue there's a tips section where the author tapped various typophile regulars for contributions.
As for the errors, there's really no excuse - searching the web is so easy a caveman could do it - so next time do a little research ;-)

But critically, not in public. So people can't have proof of where
the expertise is <cite>not</cite> coming from... The least they should do is <cite>get
a typophiler to write the thing in the first place</cite>.

His was the first comprehensive history of graphic design.
In focusing on the modernist thread, he reflected a general consensus, and also set the tone.
Lewis Blackwell's 20th Century Type is similar, but it's like two separate histories in one. On the one hand it shows a history of avant garde examples of modernist typography, but on the other, it dutifully shows the major type designs, many of which are historicist, as alphabetic specimens -- but few are shown in use.</div>
