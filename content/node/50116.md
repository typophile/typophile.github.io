  my website. The two word marks work in tandem on the site and help unite my print

  would really appreciate your thoughts and feedback.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n\r\n"

    black background, as maybe your clients wouldn't understand the reference.\r\nThe
    black background and sharp images looks great.\r\n\r\nMy 2 Cents."

  body: 'Excellent work, Alex. A side-comment only: Can you ''reload'' the tooltip
    upon clicking? Once I start browsing your site, I tend not to move the pointer
    at all, and so the tooltip is not updating and subsequently not displaying the
    corresponding information.'

  body: "Nice work Alex! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the site navigation is a little bit
    confusing - it took me a while to figure out that the small bars at the top represent
    different portfolio pieces and the initial click takes you all the way to the
    last page which didn't help."

  body: "Hi Andyboot, Fredrik and Seb,\r\n\r\nthanks for your comments. I really appreciate
    the feedback.\r\n\r\nThe site is a representation of how I work really \u2013
    paired back, subtle design, using the minimum of means to get maximum effect.
    My intention was for it to have stand out from other designers'sites, and to be
    memorable. As a freelancer, in relatively tough times, I need the bulk of my clientele
    (Creative Directors) to think that I have a slightly different approach to solving
    graphic problems.\r\n\r\nI understand that the navigation can appear to be a tad
    confusing, but the site is a simple gallery: if you click on the left hand side
    of an image you go to the previous slide, and right hand side the next, all continuously
    looped. I know this isn't apparent when you first visit the site, but I'd like
    to use this forum as a sounding board for designers to let me know if what I have
    done is interesting enough to make you scroll through the work\u2026 or just plain
    silly.\r\n\r\nThe colour change is just a bit of fun. A spectacle really. It's
    the core idea of the site so removing it would mean starting again! Also, it's
    an interesting way to display the variety of my one colour marks and B+W imagery.\r\n\r\nMore
    thoughts encouraged.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n\r\n"
