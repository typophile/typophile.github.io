  the small spurs of the lowercase letters a, b, d, g, h, m, n, p, q, r and u. They
  are relics of the hand-written word where a round form is attached to a straight
  line. Bloemsma decided to find out what the result would be if they were left off;
  this proved a difficult starting point for a typeface. Beginning with the lower
  case a, he drew a family of rounded yet rather asymmetrical forms with details reminiscent
  of brush-strokes. The individual letters rather neutral, but as a group make FF
  Cocon\u2122 a typeface of spirit and character."
