    people poncing on about their true italics. It reminds me of an under-endowed

    why.\"\r\n\r\nI can't leave this uncommented. How about other type designers here?
    It's frankly not true at all in my case. I don't start a new design with anything
    but ideas and pencil/paper. I'm always sketching. Once an idea starts taking shape,
    there can be many, many re-drawings of key characters before any digitization
    takes place. It's the way I'm most comfortable working because I have done a lot
    of drawing and lettering. And most of those pages don't look either neat or perfect.
    Is that what people really expect, or want, to see?\r\n\r\nIf publications want
    to see early stage material of a typeface, it is likely that the designer is reluctant
    to show them, because often the early drawings, and even several iterations of
    proofs, can look unflatteringly rough, half-baked and even unrecognizable. Carter
    has said that he doesn't feel comfortable with the drawing stage and does very
    little drawing. It's just one way to work, and clearly it's a viable one. But
    I don't think a generalization can be made from that."

    how we work at Pangea design when making typefaces. It's an easy way of documenting
    small problems that you want to correct.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is also a difference
    between a corrections sheet and sketches. Personally I dont sketch much on paper,

    for annotated proofs (distinct from preparatory sketches) as marketing. FontFont
    seems to have a penchant for this, especially Spiekermann collaborations. Maybe
    that's an unfair impression.\r\n\r\nIf you stop and think about it, it is a funny
    way to market something. I mean, it might be interesting to typophiles and such;

    because novels are already perceived as crafted, laborious and creative works
    of artists. Fonts, on the other hand, either \u2018have always been around\u2019,
    or are \u2018spit out by some computer program, if you just hit the right button\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe
    sketch is an icon, a piece of evidence for the tedious and sophisticated process
    of type design \u2013 and the human mind (even better: the human hand) that has
    been involved in it.\r\n\r\nWhile novels might not be promoted with showings of
    edited manuscripts, their authors are very often depicted <a href=\"http://cubaa.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/cocktail-called-hemingway/\">in
    the act of writing</a>, or with their tool \u2013 be it a <a href=\"http://blogs.walkerart.org/design/files/2009/03/paul_auster.jpg\">pen</a>
    or a <a href=\"http://quadri.wordpress.com/2008/01/27/much-ado-about-nothing-nihilism-and-modernist-literature-part-3-of-4/\">typewriter</a>.
    I\u2019d rather see some more (informative) correction sheets than those pictures
    of the type designer sitting in front of a screen, <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-21891-4.html\">working
