  body: "I agree. That's the one also called <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003345\">Janson
    Text</a>, in the Adobe Collection, and I think that was their name for the Linotype
    version done by Adrian Frutiger.\r\n\r\n<em> (edit - I was referring to samples
    02 and 03, which I think are both Janson. The other two samples are poor quality
    for making an ID.)</em>\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

      all we have.

  body: "I'd say Sample 01 looks like a Caslon. The T serifs are symmetrical and flared,
    and the right leg of the A looks like it extends a bit to the left of the apex.
    Other letters seem consistent with a Caslon, but there are too many versions to
    pinpoint the specific one, especially if we could be looking at metal/film type,
    rather than digital.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
