If there is a problem caused by an application going by the weight number -- and they are both designated as 400 -- rather than the weight name, is the solution to give the Book weight a numerical value of 350?

(The problem is that I already have a Light [300] and a Regular [400] weight, and a further weight in between is to be added, which would seem to indicate Book as a name.)</div>

If you have a light at 300 and a regular at 400, it seems logical--and helpful to your clients--to say your Book is 350. It would give the user the cue that it sits between the other two.
I think the word "Regular" is the toad though. It is looked at by software as the basic style.

For me a "Book" style is "a bit bolder" and "wider" than a "Regular" under the two assumption: 

1. the Regular style is not bold or medium
2. the Regular is designed for common use (office stuff...) and optimized for 12 pt like it schould (beside display fonts)

I think it's the name. AFAIK, for InDesign "Regular" and "Book" are two names to describe the same thing, so if the family has these two weights you might run into problems as only one will be visible.

I believe the number is used for sorting the weights in the Style submenu.</div>

I guess the safest thing to do is rename the font "Text", and give it a numerical weight of 350.

The conflict causes one of the fonts to not show in the InDesign CS2 menu, although both did in CS.
At least, that's the report I'm getting -- I assume my client isn't having cache problems.

I agree with Andreas' understanding of what a Book font is, but am constrained by the behavior of layout applications -- and the FontLab interface.</div>

Futura Book,* 1932
Futura Book, whose stroke weight is in between those of the Light and Bold, was originally* intended for even text setting;* nevertheless, the formal proportions of this style are so harmonious that it has been cut for all sizes.*

<b>Notes</b>
* Book: Not quite "Buchschrift," but close enough in this context

* originally: I assume Andreas misspelled "ursprünglich" as "ursorünglich" in his text above

* even text setting: "glatten Satz" is not really used anymore, I think. This seems to me to mean the even color setting that you typically find on the page of a book that only has text on it, if you understand what I mean

* sizes: Andreas, "Graden" here means sizes, not styles (i.e., light, medium, bold), right?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is the info of the Futura Buchschrift (Book) from its time. Saying the type was optimised for body text only, but due to the fine harmonic design it was further developed for the whole range of type sizes. - So to me its no difference in understanding of the term Book. Like many type designs of this time the Mager/Leichte/Light version was the "native" Regular style.

Futura Buchschrift, 1932
Die Futura Buchschrift, deren Strichstärke zwischen dem mageren und dem halbfetten Schnitt der Futura die Mitte hält, war ursprünglich vor allem für den glatten Satz bestimmt, doch erwiesen sich die Formverhältnisse gerade dieser Garnitur als so harmonisch, daß sie in allen Graden geschnitten wurde.

Funnily, Renner himself used the Halbfett rather than the Mager before the Buch [book] was available (in 'Kulturbolschewismus?').

The original weights of Futura were Mager [thin], Halbfett [semifat], Fett [fat]. These weights and weight names seem to have been common in Germany and used in other sanserifs too (Erbar, Elegant Grotesk, Super Grotesk).
Futura Buch(schrift) [book] was added inbetween Mager and Halbfett. (Similarly, a Normal was added to Erbar.) Maybe it is safe to say that the Buch is neither a thinner nor a fatter version of any regular because there <cite>was no</cite> such Regular before, rather, the Buch <cite>is</cite> the missing Regular.

(German) weight names then and now differ, and it's not possible to translate them directly.* It seems that these new sanserifs required rethinking of weights -- weight names, number of weights, relation of weights -- which was not an issue in earlier serif types.

* Interestingly, Syntax's weights are called Mager and Halbfett, and a specimen (1968?) translates Mager as Regular, and Halbfett as Bold.

But this isn't much related to Nick's original question any more ...

		<div class="commentbody">Pablo: <em>I [...] plan to rename the Regular to Medium [...]</em>

The sequence of font weights like the following on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font">Wikipedia</a> obviously seem to be influenced by the way some applications list them:

[...]
Light
Book
Normal / regular / roman / plain
Medium
Demi-bold / semi-bold
[...]

Personally I have my doubts about this sequence. The ‘Book’ weight should come <em>after</em> the ‘Regular’ weight in my opinion, like the ‘Regular’ of Monotype’s <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=664568">Bembo Book</a> is an emboldened version of Monotype’s <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=165060">Bembo</a>’s ‘Regular’ weight.

Especially when the transition took place from (hot) metal to photo composing there was a shift in weight, and this effect was even more emphasized by the (sometimes [too] rapid) conversion to digital type. Also the fact that single masters were used for the production of text and display sizes made matters worse. What is considered to be ‘Regular’ in our time is a gradation lighter than what was used as ‘Regular’ in the times of foundry- and hot-metal type. The ‘Book’ weight offers the option to add a slightly heavier weight for relatively small point sizes, hence its name.

So, I would never replace the ‘Regular’ weight by ‘Medium’ (which is in my opinion a synonym for ‘Semi-bold’, i.e. in between ‘Regular’ and ‘Bold’), and for the DTL Library I use therefore:

[...]
Light (300)
Regular (400)
Book (500)
Medium (600)
Bold (700)
[...]
