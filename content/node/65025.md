body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI'm currently designing a TV brand for an ISTD project. I am looking
  for a typeface to be used on screen and for print.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this thread
  - http://www.typophile.com/node/3413 it stated for maximum legibility on screen
  a typeface with a high x-height should be used.\r\n\r\nSo please recommend some
  san-serif and slab-serif fonts with high x-heights.\r\n\r\nI have used http://www.neutura.org/Neutrino.html
  for my logo if this helps :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

  body: Eras has a big x-height. Though it would be kinda crappy on screen. Point
    is, high x-height shouldn't be the only criteria. What's the audience for the
    brand? What kind of content or personality is associated with it? BTW, the post
    you referred to is golden.

    an international TV Brand. We love our drama, reality TV, films, soaps and niche
    programmes. We commission gutsy programmes and blend cool drama with our own lifestyles.
    We segue effortlessly from escapist, to gritty, to humanitarian, to sensationalist.\r\n\r\nThe
    picture is fantastic. What\u2019s missing is the frame. We\u2019ve lost our mojo.
    We are too passive \u2013 lost in the avalanche of brands (movies, adverts, sponsors,
    TV shows) screaming for attention.\r\n\r\nWe need to build a big, bold brand \u2013
    to forge emotional connections with our audiences \u2013 to be open and compelling
    \u2013 rooted in truth and effect. We want to carve out a place in people\u2019s
    hearts \u2013 be a challenger and express a clear point of view. We need to be
    more than expected \u2013 not just any other channel.\r\n\r\nThe Brief\r\nWe want
    you to develop the identity/look and creative direction of the channel.\r\n\r\nName\r\nChannel
    X is only a working title \u2013 we want you to come up with a name that reflects
    the personality and values of the channel.\r\n\r\nLogo\r\nCreate a logo that represents
    the channel. It can be live action, animation-based and it needs to have a strong,
    bold attitude that feels alive while being essentially typographic. This needs
    to be applied for on screen use and for a range of channel marketing materials
    and merchandise.\r\n\r\ndo\r\n\u2013 create a distinct, expressive, cohesive,
    entertaining, exciting channel look.\r\n\u2013 have a strategy that is driven
    by the proposition \u2018stimulation for the masses\u2019.\r\n\u2013 relate the
    look to channel content.\r\n\r\ndon\u2019t\r\n\u2013 create typical logo idents
    that feel generic.\r\n\u2013 create typical TV design.\r\n\r\nTarget Audience\r\nOur
    audience\r\n\u2013 love being entertained.\r\n\u2013 are not affluent but have
    sophisticated spending and tastes.\r\n\u2013 are articulate but not necessarily
    university educated.\r\n\u2013 are 16\u201345 with a slight male bias.\r\n\u2013
    are a cultural mix.\r\n\u2013 includes young parents.\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n\r\nI
    feel the channel is trying to be like a mix of Channel 4 and MTV."

    Laudatio for video/screen work - it's very good at that. It's not technically
    a sans, but its flares do give it great visual interest at larger sizes. However
    in print I would not use it for more than a couple of lines of text; for that
    I would find a font that matches Laudatio but with a smaller x-height (and perhaps
    not as wide). Maybe Pascal.\r\n\r\nIf you want something more contemporary and
    rigid, try FF Balance, which actually evokes \"TV\" to me quite strongly. It even
    has gentle traps, which would compensate for dot gain in video. Also, you could
    use it for print text, but still not long text.\r\n\r\nLogo feedback in that other

    enough to impact legibility on screen except in the heaviest or most compact weights.
    The kind of small x-heights that effect legibility are found in serif designs
    like Centaur and Mrs. Eaves which really aren\u2019t likely to get used on screen
    anyway. "

  body: The contrast between the white text and the blue could be improved. Perhaps
    also bump the opacity of the shape up to 80% (maybe even 85%) to knock out more
    of the background distractions. Right now the background is competing too much
    with the presented information. Just my 2 cents.
