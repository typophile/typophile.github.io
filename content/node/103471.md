body: "The Solopedia is an outstanding resource for identifying fonts. \r\nFor many
  years it has been updated monthly by \"Character\" and posted at usenet newsgroup
  alt.binaries.fonts.\r\n The updated version is then incorporated in <a href=\"\r\nhttp://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/solopedia-c.htm
  /\">the web version</a>.\r\nThe final issue of the Solopedia curated by \"Character\"
  was released today. Here is his post to alt.binaries.fonts:\r\n\"Attached is the
  zipped version of the May 2013 edition of the Solopedia....\r\nDue to some severe
  health problems, this will be the last edition that  I'll be able to produce or
  contribute to.\r\nIt would be great if someone would take up the reins and continue
  to oversee its continued progress.\"\r\nCharacter\"\r\nI have posted this information
  in the type ID board as it is primarily of interest to type ID specialists rather
  than other activities of Typophile.\r\nWe will miss character's contribution. \r\nPerhaps
  one of the contributors to the type ID board might consider taking over this project.\r\nDon"
