body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a typeface with two versions of each character.
  I made two sets and called them @set1 and @set2. Every set has five characters after
  which I like to 'swap' to the other set. The characters are C E J S Z and c e j
  s z. \r\nFor example. I like to go like this: ABCdeFGHIJklmnopqrsTUVWXYZabcDE etc\r\nI
  can't get the code working, can somebody help me?\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPieter"

    doesn't look like it belongs in the liga feature, but rather calt.
