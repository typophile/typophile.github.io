  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been given a project to design a poetry anthology. I&rsquo;ve got a suitable typeface, and was planning on using an asymmetrical layout with wide left-hand columns (35mm on A5 paper).  The paper size was dictated by the client.</p>
<p>My problem is that all the poems are VERY different from one another and how I should best lay this out.</p>
<p>Line lengths are as follows (all in verse)</p>
<p>1 x 6 lines
1 x 8 lines
2 x 11 lines
2 x 13 lines
3 x 14 lines
3 x 15 lines
5 x 16 lines
2 x 17 lines
3 x 18 lines
3 x 19 lines
1 x 20 lines
2 x 21 lines
2 x 22 lines
4 x 24 lines
2 x 27 lines
3 x 28 lines
2 x 29 lines</p>
<p>Then there are also a few longer poems:</p>
<p>2 x 36 lines (both prose)
1 x 37 lines (verse)
1 x 46 lines (verse)
1 x 48 lines (verse)
1 x 99 lines (verse)</p>
<p>We are trying to give particular emphasis for each author (of which there are 38 in total), which means in reality they each need to start on a fresh page, rather than overflowing the poetry. I have been supplied with just 7 images.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few pages of the layout (I think it needs a lot of improvement still, I&rsquo;ve never designed a poetry book before)</p>
<p>My main problem is with the number of lines however&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want the short poems to look lonely, while the longer ones overflow uncomfortably onto the next page (which with fixed margins might result in just one or two lines flowing over which would look horrible). The solution of extending the page to include 29 lines also doesn&rsquo;t work very well aesthetically (see attached 40-41).</p>
<p>Help?? And thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The layout looks pretty good to me; and I don&rsquo;t see a specific conflict between short and long text lines poems (this being a collective work, it is nearly unavoidable I guess).</p>
<p>A couple of suggestion:</p>
<ol>
<li>I would increase a little the word spacing;</li>
<li>On page 41, what does the last line &ldquo;Robyn Bolam&rdquo; stand for? Was it a sort of signature left there for mistake? If it is a line in the poem, instead, it is too close to the page number, which should have more white space above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m not enthusiast about featuring to different typefaces - but if it&rsquo;s your choice, then it&rsquo;s ok. Melville looks very nice, anyway - I haven&rsquo;t seen it before.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I design quite a lot of poetry books, and your layout looks fine to me.</p>
<p>However, the longer poems running into the page numbers is problematic in my eyes. Perhaps you could choose for the more conventional location of the numbers; in the bottom left and right corners? Maybe it won&rsquo;t look as harmonic, but at least you will have some breathing room for those poems that run a few lines longer than the rest. Another option is placing them in the middle on the side edges of the pages (i.e. in the left margin of the left page, and the right margin of the right page).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of setting poem titles in all caps. A lot of poets I design books for use all caps as well, apparently they like it, but I nearly always advise them against it. I do often set them in bold or medium, but usually at the same size as the poems. If you want to differentiate them more, you could try indenting the titles. But I guess using a sans serif can also work.</p>
<p>On a side note, in your pdf v10, hyphens are being used instead of en- or em-dashes.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Letting poems run onto a second page looks fine. I like your body type a lot. For titles, how about a bolder version of the style you use for author&rsquo;s names, instead of all caps? Or if all caps, letterspace a little? Also, the subtitles or alternate titles should probably be in the same face as the actual titles, though the italic text face is very nice. On page 5 of your PDF, you probably want to use dashes — instead of hyphens -. I do think it;s far better to let a poem run onto a second page than let it run so close to the page number. For structured verse, break poems at stanza breaks, if you can.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Looks like the Sans Bold choice for poem titles isn&rsquo;t that popular here, Katy. :-)</p>
<p>Here are some alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If titles <em>must</em> be set in all caps, try to set them in the serif used in the poems as well, as others suggested, perhaps a bit spaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or you could try to set them in all small caps insted of all caps; they should look much less invasive on the page - perhaps increasing a bit the size (say, texts are set in 10, titles in small caps are set in 10,5 or 11, but do some prints of the page and have a look yourself).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the most obviuos choice: set the titles exactly as the texts, uppercase and lowercase, again trying to increase them a bit (half or a point more than the poems).</p>
</li>

<p>Thank you ever so much for the response! It really helps (especially on the en-dash, I obviously hadn&rsquo;t done anywhere near a thorough enough check)!</p>
<p>RJ23359 Internal 36-39 v5.pdf: I experimented with indenting the titles and it seemed to make the page a little busy. As for folios, my only concern with having them either side of the page is as you say the harmony of a symmetric folio layout against an asymmetric page design. I&rsquo;m also wondering if I should tackle the margins for prose differently to verse. (you can see what it looks like in the standard format in the attached).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also found a good poem to show my overflow problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think overflowing a poem to the next page is a big problem, although I usually discuss that with the editor, publisher or the poet. Because I found that poets especially have a strong opinion on where exactly their poem gets cut to the next page. If the poet in question isn&rsquo;t alive anymore, I talk to the editor/publisher, obviously.</p>
<p>With the prose on the last page&hellip; I do think the right margin is getting a bit narrow there. But I guess the only way to change that is to make the left margins slightly less wide&hellip;</p>
<p>The page numbers, I think this could work, definitely keep it in mind if you experiment further with them. :)</p>

What doesn&rsquo;t work, for me, is the page number, which looks more like a verse number, that way.
