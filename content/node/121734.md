  body: "If this is a font rather than lettering I hope someone finds it for you.\r\nWhether
    font or lettering, the basic structure is similar to Bodoni Extra Wide Bold\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/URWBodoniExtraWideBoldAsForma_3992.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/URWBodoniExtraWideBoldAsDomus_4828.gif]\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/urw-bodoni/\r\nThe
    cross bar on the _F_ and the top stroke and terminal on _S_ are an old idea using
    a tilde [aka flame or cyma] stroke. Compare to a font from 1907 called Lining
    Anglo [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LiningAngloBBS1907SM_6547.jpg] Here
    the tilde is at the bottom not the top of _S_ but it's the same stroke.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"

    Extra Wide Bold. I just picked the first font that was similar.\r\nDon"
