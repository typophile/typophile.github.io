  from the WPA period.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where you can find reprints of these?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2006_1375_5789.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/9048b3037899a3dd294352f49b4a809f1a2cb410_m_5831.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/h2_RL_3507.2001.1.3.jpg]"

    download\r\n\r\n3) print!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the high-res versions aren't always
    THAT high-res, but most are pretty good with a bit of photoshop tweaking.\r\n\r\nLooks
    like they're constantly updating it with more and more posters as well...really
    like this one:\r\n\r\nhttp://memory.loc.gov/service/pnp/cph/3f00000/3f05000/3f05400/3f05439r.jpg"
