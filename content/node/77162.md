body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI can't find anywhere on the net of corporate guidelines (downloadable
  PDF) of companies such as Apple, Adobe, Ikea, Microsoft etc. I want to learn more
  of how they present guidelines in terms of logo usage, color, templates for products,
  retail display etc.\r\n\r\nI am looking for corporate guidelines to help me figure
  out how to present to a company where they products from a retail standpoint as
  well have a very good corporate design system. \r\n\r\nOr if there are any exceptional
  books I can buy that would be also ideal.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    tend to be rather protective of their very expensively developed brands, intellectual
    property and all that.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, in the age of wikileaks, no doubt
    someone is compiling a resource somewhere."

    make them publically available because they are viewed as internal documents.
    In the old days they were often printed manuals in 3-ring binder format with pages
    of camera-ready logos that could be cut out. These days they're often distributed
    as PDFs and logos & templates can be downloaded from a password-protected site."

  body: "Wow, what a great link. Thanks for sharing.\r\n\r\nI was happy to find this
    link and thought it would be CI guidelines, but the links are logos given the
    file size and the .SIT files are password protected. If anyone knows the password
    it would be nice to check out what's inside the file.\r\n\r\nhttp://users.ncrvnet.nl/mstol/56.htm\r\n\r\nAre
    there any more links out there people know about? Trying to find the bigger companies
    like Apple, Microsoft, Target etc. looking for retail operations with a balance
    of online and offline presence."
