  in my own typefaces, and have found that Futura's oblique is literally nothing more
  than a 9 degree slant applied to the corresponding non-oblique weight. Now, while
  obliques are certainly simpler than true italics, they're still supposed to be more
  than just mechanical slanting. I might expect this from a cheaper face, but in the
  case of a designer-favorite like Futura, I was rather surprised.\r\n\r\nIs this
  more common than I apparently think? Futura's Oblique pays no attention to the changes
  that need be made to stroke width, diagonals and curves.\r\n\r\nBTW - For the experiment,
  I created two text boxes in Illustrator. Both were filled with A-Z, a-z and 0-9.
  One was in set in Futura Light, the other was in Light Oblique. I then converted
  them both to outlines and sheared the first text box (Futura Light) by 9 degrees.
  I then overlaid the two textboxes to find that EVERY glyph lines up EXACTLY.\r\n\r\nStrange
  stuff."

  body: "This is quite common with sans serifs. Adrian Frutiger used to use it with
    his typefaces\u2014I'm told\u2014because back in the day when type foundry drawing
    offices still employed 100s of letter drawers, it would save the company so much
    time and money.\r\n\r\nBut if you look at Univers and Frutiger, as well as many
    other typefaces (like Helvetica, too) you will see that this is the case. Note
    that for new designs, this comes up way less. Good new families are expected to
    have true Italics. It seems to just be want the people want nowadays."

    recently Avant Garde was completely redrawn... then the obliques were just slanted.
    I think it was linotype? I believe the futura the barbican in london uses as part
    of their corporate identity has tweaked obliques. '

  body: An italic companion to a sans does not necessarily make it better. Redrawing
    the oblique doesn't make it an italic in my opinion. It just makes it a better
    made slanted version. Ideoligically I'm not against sans italics, but they don't
    always fit where well made obliques do.

    recent ITC Avant Garde Pro OpenType version. This was made at ITC, not at Linotype.
    It is sold at itcfonts.com, linotype.com, fonts.com, and certainly many other
    locations."

    visually corrected obliques.

    I think it would be wrong to say it was \"completely redrawn\". I think it would
    be better to say that it was reworked and extended. ITC made the decision to maintain
    backward compatibility with the existing version of the font and that drew criticism
    with some people seeing the effort as a somewhat wasted opportunity.\r\n"
