body: "If I have two typefaces open simultaneously in FontLab 5.04 for Windows, I
  suddenly can't see preview/metrics windows from one of the them if the other is
  active, it just disappears until I give that typeface focus again (make that font
  window active). This suddenly happened yesterday, and I can't find out how to make
  the windows behave normally again. I might have involuntarily hit some letter combination
  that disables metrics windows from different typefaces simultaneously, and can't
  reset it. Any help highly appreciated.\r\n"
