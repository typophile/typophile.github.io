  and a lot of words to put in it! Can anyone help me out and advise me on what's
  the best typography for these cases? I need it to be confortable to read at 4 points
  size... is this possible? I know it  will also depend on the printing tecnique...
  but any suggestions would be very nice :)\r\nThankyou so much! "
