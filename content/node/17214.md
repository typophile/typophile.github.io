    Carson</a> that might be a good start.

    called Chicken Parts but I've also seen references before to Chicken Plain. Never
    seen it tho."

  body: "You're not going to easily find info about Chicken. That rare beast was part
    of David Carson's Ray Gun-era body of work. Chicken was only briefly available
    through GarageFonts, and is now ancient history. David and his colleague Betsy
    Kopshina Schulz have been out of GF for years. Betsy is super busy these days
    with her design business and family. David is, as you would expect, busy with
    myriad projects and his own family.\r\n\r\nBetsy's website is at http://ww.adesigngarden.com.
    DC's website is at http://www.davidcarsondesign.com. Contact info for both is
    available on their sites. You could try asking them a few very specific, well-thought-out
    questions after you do all possible research about Ray Gun and Carson's design
    aesthetic. There are a couple of good books on the subject, and tons of info on
    the web.\r\n\r\nI'm curious - do you actually have a copy of Chicken, or are you
    working from a printed specimen?\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    body: "Hi! Tkx for the information! It's really helpful! I see the only way to
      get more info is to email them.. i already searched a lot and it's very odd
      that there isn't information about any font by david carson! I'll continue my
      research.. and hope that someone answer my emails! :)\r\n(I'm working from a
      printed specimen)"

        with that font. It was too long ago. I only did the \r\nfontographer creation

    these days in any packaged meat product that doesn't say \"beef\" on it: mechanically
    separated chicken. And it would even be funny, if it weren't true.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
