Athelas is probably a little better.

And speaking of Rosetta: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Huronia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is very nice.

		<div class="commentbody">Nice to hear that you’ve found something to your liking! Don’t be shocked by the prices. Creating digital letters is a sophisticated and complex venture. It’ll take you between eight and ten hours on average—not for the whole font, mind you, for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one glyph<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (≈ letter). The Rosetta fonts are very reasonably priced. I think you won’t regret licensing Huronia. It’ll make your thesis stand out for sure.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->think<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I know what you mean, but as a whole, this could be misleading. Better, probably, to just give a time for, say, populating both <em>Controls and Basic Latin</em> plus <em>Controls and Basic Latin-1 Supplement</em> (basically, and older PostScript font, having about 190 glyphs out of the 256 available spots). That should not take 1,710 hours (about a full year, using a conventional 8 hour day minus vacations &amp; holidays), even for four weights &ndash; though it could be close, I suppose (though all four weights is not &ldquo;a single glyph&rdquo;). Finally, getting paid the full amount for each glyph&rsquo;s cost may be appropriate for commissioned work where there will be only one sale, harder to argue when a font is released as available for multiple users and multiple purchasers.</p>
<p>If your general point is that the price of $30-$40 each is rather too low even for retail fonts, I&rsquo;d go alone with that. One technology back from PostScript (say, Linotron 202), the list price for a single font (e.g., just the roman) was about $150. Less for smaller players like Compugraphic, but that would be the price of a Linotype font for one of their digital machines like the 202 or 505. While it did take a little longer, production of those fonts didn&rsquo;t involve <em>substantially</em> more work than today&rsquo;s digital fonts.</p>
<p>But that number too can be illusory &ndash; another marketing trick. If you bought a 20-font pack from Linotype &amp; drew on it as you needed new fonts, you wound up paying about $50 a single font &ndash; in 1980 dollars, of course, when a brand-new Chevy Malibu was about $6,000. So, closer to $200 a single font in 2015 dollars.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to let people know the amount of work &amp; attendant costs that go into font production, no need to use a number that could lead to confusion.</p>

<p>On John Hudsons&rsquo;s pricing, character design averages $40/glyph, hinting $30/glyph, and $480/day for writing the features code. I&rsquo;ve written a lot of feature code &ndash; It would be an odd font for it to take me more than a few hours, except for kerning. It takes me around  12 to 18 hours to kern a roman font, and 6 to 12 hours for an italic, but that&rsquo;s for a working roman for academic publishing, which for me includes a lot more than 192 characters &ndash; arbitrary fractions, true-cut superiors, small caps. etc.. For Latin Basic plus Latin 1 only, 8 hours for both positioning (includes kerning) and substitution features.</p>
<p>So, on John&rsquo;s pricing, $70 per glyph for design and hinting, on simple features (one day) add  another $2.50/glyph, but realistically, I&rsquo;d add $7.50/glyph. For very complicated fonts, the features code will take longer, but then, there will be more characters&hellip;</p>
<p>That yields between $72.50 and $77.50 per glyph. If each one takes you 8 hours, you may need another line of work &ndash; your return would around $9.00/hr. The truth is, it doesn&rsquo;t take anyone 8 hours for each glyph. An &ldquo;aacute,&rdquo; for example, doesn&rsquo;t take 8 hours over and above an &ldquo;a&rdquo; plus a &ldquo;combining acute.&rdquo; Nor an &ldquo;agrave,&rdquo; &ldquo;acircumflex,&rdquo; etc. a comma and a period give the pieces for a colon &amp; semicolon, though spacing may be a it different. But not 16 hours worth.</p>
<p>That was my whole point, someone saying &ldquo;it takes 8 hours a glyph&rdquo; is misleading, and in the end will lead to people not trusting what&rsquo;s generally calimed.</p>
<p>BTW, if you read the referenced post, those charges are for a commissioned work &ndash; one sale only. Two things: (1) it does not take 8 hours per glyph, and (2) most fonts, like Huronia, are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> commissioned work, but will be purchased by multiple buyers.</p>
<p>192 x $77.50 = $61,380. Seems a it high. If you have to sell the font for $35, you&rsquo;ll need to sell 1,753 copies to make the same amount of money. And while there are added costs for a full family, there are also econ0mies.</p>
<p>(By the way, for the Original Poster, John Hudson is Ross Mills business partner at Tiro Typeworks. Ross Mills did much of the work on Huronia, with Rosetta handling some further details. Ross will never get rich off Huronia, if you look at the pro version, you&rsquo;ll see it is a labor of love.)</p>
<p>In the end, while the publisher can always set the price as they choose, there is another party in all this, the user. If they feel a font overpriced, as long as there are alternatives, they won&rsquo;t buy. How hard the designer did or did not have to work isn&rsquo;t particularly relevant to them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Instead of basically calling us (at a minimum that&rsquo;s me, R and that forgotten punchcutter) liars, consider what we probably really mean. We&rsquo;re not talking about things like &ldquo;n&rdquo; and &ldquo;ñ&rdquo; each taking eight hours – certainly not just their black bodies. I for one don&rsquo;t produce fonts with very large character sets, so I&rsquo;m not factoring in those armies of near-trivial composites. So, for example, when you divide the ~800 hours I spent making Maral with the number of character it has (~100), guess what you get. And there are characters in Mana that did take me way over 8 hours each.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Last time I looked, this was a users forum. &ldquo;Typhophile &gt; Typography/Composition.&rdquo; In such a forum, you might consider the needs of people who use type, rather than simply ignoring them.</p>
<p>The impression you give to those of us who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->use<!-- raw HTML omitted --> type is that ideally, type is created by artists. Like painting or sculpture, there are people out there who commission the artist to make fonts (for reasons unknown). For the masses to see type, I suppose the sale of fonts has to be to museums, like other works of art. The costs of all this are to recovered by the museum charging admission, where interested people pay to look at the fonts.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about people who create type this way. Whatever. But if that is your model, there is little point in &ldquo;instructing&rdquo; all of us about all the time and skill involved, since we aren&rsquo;t the audience you&rsquo;re aiming at anyway.</p>
<p>There is a marketplace out there. If you can get $1,000 a font (I own Trinité, remember? A customer wanted it, and paid for it. But just one, no one else uses it.) do it. If, on the other hand, the marketplace refuses to pay the amounts you want to charge, you might want to reexamine your assumptions. If it takes you 1,750 hours to create 190 characters, but no one will pay $87,500 ($50/hr) for the font, what now? Most people who sell fonts would say, well, that time spent factor has to come down. By all means,  make your own choices. But stop whining about it and asserting it is the norm. Pointless, in any case. You won&rsquo;t get much sympathy from the people who use type to create products.</p>
<p>I use type. I get $3.75 a page for the composition of scholarly monographs (not straight text), and have to compete with Asia, where for $3.00 a page, from a reputable company doing acceptable work, you can get (1) the printer-ready pdf, (2) an archival pdf, (3) a &ldquo;Universal&rdquo; pdf (contents page &amp; maybe hooked up for on-line viewing), (4) a usable ePUB file to send to Amazon &amp; Apple, and and (5) a TEI-encoded XML file.  It would be silly for me to compete by claiming that all Asians are stupid and do shoddy work. Stupid, and racist.</p>
<p>And yes, occasionally someone on Typophile makes the claim that typesetting books yields $20 a page. Your statements seem about parallel to that situation. So we have to ask, &ldquo;On exactly what data do you base your claims?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yes,  it is a kind of a lie to imply that the way you would like to work, which is not supported by a marketplace, is how everyone should work.</p>

<p>But when did I say that?
In fact it would be spineless and stupid of me to want others to be like me.</p>
<p>My only point is that some people do average eight or more hours per (non-trivial) glyph, and I suspect most of those do so because they feel it&rsquo;s the right way to do it; I know that&rsquo;s what I do it. You don&rsquo;t go to that level, because you&rsquo;re clearly a more astute businessman. I for one have never done any of the math you&rsquo;ve been doing concerning $/hr etc. Only hr/letter, and only out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Just because I&rsquo;ve want to make <!-- raw HTML omitted -->some<!-- raw HTML omitted --> money from type design (nevermind that spending time on Typophile isn&rsquo;t exactly good business sense&hellip;) you want to cast me as some sort of parasite, while in fact it increasingly seems like I&rsquo;m much more idealistic than you&hellip;</p>
