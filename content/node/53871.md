  electra and writing short essay about it for a school project. i noticed how completely
  different the formal appearance of the special characters is. i discussed this with
  a colleague and one opinion is that it was a usual practice to just use some default
  matrices to complete the linotype machine character set. i guess this is the right
  reason, but it would be great if you could help me with this and make it clearer.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ele-2_4411.jpg]\r\n\r\nin
  case the reason is really as stated, was that only linotype thing or was it monotype
  and letterpress practice as well?\r\n\r\nthank you for your replies. ondrej\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ondrej --\r\n\r\nLinotype offered several of the special characters as generic
    matrices, and these were intended for when a font did not contain the character
    in question. Not every font had some of the characters you're asking about specially
    drawn. But many did.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Electra, I know that Dwiggins did in
    fact draw these characters. I have copies of some of his sketches, including alternates
    that did not get chosen for production. When I have a chance later today or this
    weekend, I'll scan some samples to post.\r\n\r\n((BTW, I assume that this revival
    is just for an academic exercise and that you don't intend to release anything
    without permission. Linotype still owns the intellectual property and the trademarks
    for Electra. Are you in the same class as Abi?))\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

    Ondrej, those characters in the font *are* the way he chose to harmonize with
    the Electra shapes. For whatever reason, in the end, all of those were the shapes
    that he chose (perhaps with CHG's influence). Remember, you don't want the special
    characters to distract too much in text.\r\n\r\nHere are images of some of Dwiggins's
    sketches for a few of those special characters. I apologize for the quality, as
    these are scanned from photocopies. The originals are in the CH Griffith Archives
    at the University of Kentucky, Lexington.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Dwiggins is working
    in ink at 10 x 12 pt size (he didn't begin working in the larger, pencil outlines
    until Caledonia). These scans are actual size at 100ppi. Sorry for the scrolling
    on the last one.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Electra_ink_UK-E47_5129.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Electra_ink_UK-E137_6483.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Electra_ink_UK-E138_4199.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Electra_ink_UK-E141_5821.gif]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe
    note at the bottom of card [E138] says \"Hard to make a \xA7 that fits the Electra
    snap. Try again after you see this lot.\"\r\n\r\nThe note at the bottom of card
    [E141], under the ampersand, says \"Attempt to get a flourished 'and' in the Electra
    feeling.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't have dates for these. WAD wasn't as diligent
    about dating things at this stage as he was later. The card numbers are Griffith's
    cataloging. They may or may not indicate any chronology. \r\n\r\n-- Kent."

    WAD won one. :)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    i was almost 100% sure the asterisk and daggers are those added characters, so
    i am quite surprised now to see that WAD actually designed them. i especially
    like how nicely the asterisk is marked to be \"good\" :)\r\nafter seeing these
    drawings i feel a bit sorry for not looking for the complete set earlier. i chose
    rather experimental approach for my revival exercise \u2013 it is based almost
    entirely on a 50's dutch book set in 12pt, the Emblems booklet and a quick overview
    of WAD's work and design methods. i am quite satisfied with the result, but now
    i see it wouldn't be bad to incorporate more of those nice subtle details into
    it.\r\n\r\nondrej"

  body: "<cite> > Who\u2019s he talking too?</cite>\r\n\r\nGenerally WAD's annotations
    were directed at Griff. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure about this comment on card [E138]:
    \"Not for use. But the . [period] as furnished seems light to me, and I am not
    quite sure about Griff's apostrophes, commas, etc., but let &#146;em ride for
    present?\"\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that the final comma is nothing like what WAD
    drew here.\r\n\r\nThe period and comma would have likely been put in by drawing
    office initially, probably pulled from some standard. Because WAD mentions Griffith
    in the third person here, I'm not sure who he would have been addressing with
    this comment. If this were Metro, I would say he might have been talking to Gage,
    who remained involved in some of the process throughout. \r\n\r\nMore likely in
    this case he's talking to Larson, head of the drawing office. But, I'm not sure
    his sketches would have gone straight to Larson without first passing through
    CHG, so this particular comment is curious.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

    words to the wise.\r\n\r\n<cite> > it is based almost entirely on a 50\u2019s
    dutch book set in 12pt, the Emblems booklet and a quick overview of WAD\u2019s
    work and design methods.</cite>\r\n\r\nNot an unreasonable approach. WAD would
    have overseen and approved the Emblems specimen. An Alfred A Knopf book designed
    and overseen by WAD himself (like <em>Not Under Forty</em> by Willa Cather, or
    <em>The Borzoi Reader</em> edited by Carl van Doren -- both 1936, right after
    Electra's release) might have made for a more authentic exemplar than a &#146;50s
    Dutch book, but that's a small matter. \r\n\r\nOriginal sketches might give additional
    insight, but they cannot be followed slavishly (as DB points out so succinctly),
    since they were a means to an end -- that end being the printed type in everyday
    use. What Dwiggins and his peers knew as Electra is what we can all see in the
    books they made, not the drawings that started the process.\r\n\r\n-- K."

    is an important issue to address in the brief of any revival endeavor.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, if you're kerning the font, then it isn't \"accurate\" to the original
    (in one sense), because metal Linotype casting had no kerning.\r\n\r\n(. . . unless,
    perhaps, you limit yourself to only recreating the effect of the handful of two-letter
    logotypes that were produced for Electra -- which most comps, however, probably
    didn't take the time to insert.)\r\n\r\n-- K."

    made two versions, for the first one i redrew what i saw on the pages of the dutch
    book, trying to make the digital printout as similar to the original as possible,
    but keeping the outlines clean, sharp and rational, not blobby as automatic tracing
    would produce.\r\nfor the second version, i compared the first one with Emblems
    and now i am doing some editing to harmonize the appearance of the text. that
    is also reason why i decided to kern the second version, with capitals that wide
    the kerning is really necessary. \r\ni guess the main purpose of our revival exercise
    was to learn the rules and principles of type design by learning from the masters
    and i really did learn a lot, although my revival may not be perfect. anyways,
    i am happy i chose Electra.\r\n\r\no"
