  body: Uppercases are most probably coming from [[http://opentype.info/blog/2008/09/14/traffic-sign-typefaces-france|L1
    or L2]], the typefaces France is using for road and traffic signs. URW++ offers
    a commercial digitization called [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/font/T1052/signal|Signal]]
    (1, 2, 3 and 4). But as there's no lowercases on any of them, "de la" should come
    from something else (really doubting they could have backslanted L4).

    unusual for French signs to have lower case characters.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"
