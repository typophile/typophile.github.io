  printer/typographer Wil Hudson at his Vancouver shops during the 1970s, located
  at:\r\n\r\n[[http://flickr.com/photos/hhjohnston]]\r\n\r\nThey were taken mainly
  by my father, photographer Hal Johnston, and have been recently digitised and uploaded.\r\n\r\n"

    Commons license for students to use in their papers about Hudson and/or letterpress.

    access to a better scanner.  Locating the negatives was the slowest part. '

  body: Very nice. I recognise the steps in the photos with Hannah, on Cambie Street,
    just around the corner from where I used to have my studio in the Dominion Building.
    At the recent wayzgoose in Vancouver, I met someone who assumed that I was Wil
    Hudson's son. We had this rather strange conversation, in which he kept making
    references to my father, and it took me a while to figure out the mistake.

  body: "Great archive. I stumbled across these searching for information about Wil
    Hudson who (as is obvious) worked in Cape Dorset Kinngait Studios of which I am
    the current arts advisor manager. I have been involved in the studios since 1988
    and have hear all the stories bout Wil and his influences. I am a lithographer
    by trade but we still have the Vandercook that Wil used as a proofing press and
    we are actively getting into readiness to do it's part in the year collections.
    I have sent many of these photos (Flickr collection) to Terrance Ryan now mid
    70's who hired Wil, to work in Dorset and I have had local help from Facebook
    to ID the Inuit people in the photos, some of whom are still alive.\r\nCan anyone
    tell me if Wil is still roaming this earth? He was such a powerful and influential
    person in the development of the Kinngait Studios (then Kingait Press) that I'd
    like to cobble together what ever I can so he will be remembered for the contributions
    left behind.\r\nRegards\r\nWilliam Ritchie\r\n"
