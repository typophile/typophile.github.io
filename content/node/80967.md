  \u203Agf\u2039 in so many otherwise nice italic fonts so badly kerned? For example:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/font_bureau/williams_caslon_text_italic_ot/?&sample_text=meaningful%20Epistemology&acs_pt=32|Williams
  Caslon Text Italic OT]]\r\n\r\nOne of the rare exceptions:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/iowan_old_style_bt_pro_italic/?&sample_text=meaningful%20Epistemology&acs_pt=32|Iowan
  Old Style BT Pro Italic]]\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve chosen the two examples, just because
  I like both typefaces very much.\r\n\r\nSome explanations for that fact?\r\n\r\nThank
  you and kind regards\r\n\r\nMario"

  body: "In the foundry type days of metal, fonts generally had no kerning, as we
    understand it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, combinations like df and gy were allowed to butt
    up to one another (not overlap, of course), and created odd holes in the flow
    of text, but this was not considered an issue, as there were many such holes,
    especially after cap T, V, W and Y followed by a lower case vowel. The concept
    of kerning for aesthetics/readability did not exist.\r\n\r\nConsequently, there
    was no onus on type designers to design italic g to avoid this problem.\r\nHence
    oldstyle revivals that are faithful to lettershape, but anachronistic because
    they add copious 21st century kern pairs to smooth text \"color\", should find
    some digital way to remediate the problem.\r\n\r\nWith the change from oldstyle
    to modern in early 19th century, the single-bowl italic g solved the problem.\r\nWith
    the advent of historicism c.1900, and the re-introduction of many old style typefaces,
    the problem re-emerged.\r\n\r\nLinotype introduced \"two letter logotypes\" in
    the mid 20th century, for those problematic cap/lower case sequences.\r\nLinotype
    also redesigned italic f to have a straight descender with no hook/ball, in several
    faces.\r\nMonotype produced special ligatures for its large Garamond Italic, for
    character combinations such as gg, gf, etc.\r\n\r\nToday, the options are:\r\n\r\n-
    add positive kerning\r\n- create an OpenType ligature\r\n- create an OpenType
    alternate form of f, g, and y, for contextual substitution\r\n- and of course,
    design the glyphs so that the problem doesn't occur even in plain text\r\n- combinations
    of the above\r\n\r\nBoth the OpenType features are on by default\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "For the record, Williams Caslon Text Italic does have positive values for
    these two kern pairs. One may disagree with how Bill chose to address the situation,
    but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate to say that \u201Csomeone didn\u2019t
    pay attention\u201D in this case.\r\n\r\nAs Nick points out, these are historically
    problematic combinations, especially for designs which attempt a certain historical
    fidelity.\r\n\r\nJohn Downer has managed to design the Iowan Old Style italic
    <em>g, f,</em> and <em>y</em> glyphs so that no kerning values are needed in these
    combinations, while still retaining the essential characteristics of his historic
    models, relatively uncompromised \u2014 no mean feat.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I didn\u2019t mean to be rude by saying \u203Apaying no attention\u2039.
    Nick took some more time to elaborate on this kerning issue. But reviving a classical
    type for digital use there would have been several options to get around this,
    as Nick pointed out. Unless it was on purpose to keep the historical fidelity.
    But as printing is much more perfect nowadays it is debatable to keep these \u203Aflaws\u2039.
    One wouldn\u2019t mind that as much in letterpress i guess."
