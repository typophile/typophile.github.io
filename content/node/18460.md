  target=\"_blank\">Tea Chest Stencil EF Regular</a> but without letter cuts. Actually
  I can make a custom work on it and join the letter blocks but still curious of any
  other fonts than could be close to it especially on the way the K or the R right
  bottom tail is curved with that slab condensed style.\r\nThanks."

    However, Schadow Black Condensed is pretty close. The \"R\" has that curved bit
    but the \"K\" doesn't. Good luck!\r\n\r\nBeth"
