body: "Hi commuters of Typophile,\r\n\r\nI am a bit of a perfectionist and I also
  happen to have a rather extensive font library. I'm using Windows 7 which has outright
  diabolical font previewing features. \r\n\r\nIdeally, I wish to view body text in
  a variety of different typefaces without compiling LaTeX about a thousand times
  (not an exaggerated number).\r\n\r\nI was hoping somebody could recommend me something
  to preview fonts.\r\n\r\nCurrently I went through a number of existing sites and
  software:\r\n\r\n- wordmark.it (web/JS based viewer)\r\n- FontViewOK (lightweight
  font viewer)\r\n- Fast Font Preview (software - looks better, still lacks functionality)\r\n-
  STC font browser (so far the best I've seen)\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with the
  above solutions is that I they all recognise different parts of my library, possibly
  because I use both OpenType as well as TrueType fonts (or perhaps because my JavaScript
  is somehow only halfway working). Regardless, solutions like these won't work.\r\n\r\nThe
  only font browser that correctly showed my entire font library was STC font browser.
  However, I'm looking for something more practical. Somebody who really goes through
  all the mess of selecting a font from a billion different fonts, will naturally
  want to e.g. sort fonts by for instance weight, size, or perhaps just by a name
  (filtering with the keyword \"Titling\" in my fonts library nicely seperates the
  real pretty fonts from those inferior, gosh I love small caps).\r\n\r\nI'll be happy
  to hear your remarks and suggestions. Thanks."
