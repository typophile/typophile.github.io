  body: "There is a font that calls itself the \"final word in geometric fonts\" (or
    words to that effect) called Geometry Soft Pro (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/geometry-soft-pro/),
    which has almost every variation of rounded geometric letter you would need. Apparently,
    the non-rounded version leaves off the word 'soft'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
