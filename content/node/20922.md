body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI've been a shadower on these forums for quite a while, and
  I must admit I was a little afraid to put some of my stuff up. But I think I need
  it this time.\r\n\r\nA colleague and I are starting a weekly podcast called <em>Witnessing
  Life</em> which is sort of a features/newsmagazine; sort of in the vein of \"All
  Things Considered\" on NPR. It is a twenty minute ordeal, with several small stories
  surrounding one big story. He is travelling to Europe for several months on a academic
  journalism grant, and along with a few strategically-placed correspondents, will
  be reporting back to me, and I'll put their audio clips together into a cohesive
  podcast.\r\n\r\nI'm also designing an identity for the project; a site, business
  cards, letterhead, a press kit, and a logo.\r\n\r\nWhat I have in mind is something
  that refers back to the old-time broadcasting days\u2014think <em>Goodnight, and
  Good Luck</em>, except with the radio.\r\n\r\nBut I do want to have a modern, colorful
  scheme. My JPEG rendering may be a little off... I'm thinking a powder blue, maybe
  a bit more intense.\r\n\r\nI think my font is a little off, though, and would appreciate
  any advice you might have about the placement and incorporation of the microphone
  into the logo as a whole. After designing it, I retrospectively realized the \"Witnessing
  Life\" part looks somewhat like the <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com\">Netflix</a>
  logo.\r\n\r\nAnd I know, the name sounds a little religious. My colleague came up
  with that, and we've gotta stick with it. But I have free reign with the design.\r\n\r\nSo,
  teachers, please give me your thoughts. I'll try not to run off crying. (-:\r\n\r\n-Andy"

    samples, especially the manipulation of type (squooshing, arc, etc.) will need
    great care in order to convey a sense of \"credibility\" in Podcast journalism.\r\n\r\nScroll

    Deco \"Atlas Shrugged\" cover. The Guy Noir stuff is pretty cool, too.\r\n\r\nI
    will definitely look closely on his stuff.\r\n\r\nThanks for the link!\r\n\r\n-Andy

  body: "I think the way you have positioned the microphone on the splashscreen visual
    is always going to work better than that of the business card, if the microphone
    was centred and behind the logo and url (the illustration could be in front and
    slightly running into the logo, though probably not the url as it is more critical
    that it can be read accurately) and the contact details worked to either side
    of the stand. I would, if possible, drop or reword the strapline, the copy really
    doesn't fit in with the retro feel of the graphics or add anything in the way
    of a description, something cosier might be an improvement if you feel you must
    keep it, I would also use the Hosted by of the splashscreen on the business card
    rather than with.\r\nTim"

  body: "I'm not sure what advice I would give about getting that \"retro\" look.
    When I do it, I rely on intuition. The stuff seems to come bubbling up out of
    subconscious memories of things I saw as a little kid in the late fifties. I just
    recently discovered a series of covers of detective novels done by an artist in
    the 1940s which looked very similar to my Guy Noir design. I don't remember ever
    seeing them before, but I may well have seen one or more of them in my grandparents'
    house as a kid. (My grandmother went through detective novels like pop corn.)\r\n\r\nAbout
    the only thing I can think of to suggest is to get hold of some reference images.
    Don't look at \"retro\" designs made by modern designers--go to the source. Antique
    stores in small towns are gold mines. Old calendars, packages, post cards, magazines,
    books--anything with graphic images applied to it. There are also some good books
    with collections of old graphic imagery. The Taschen \"All American Ads\" series
    is great as is Louise Fili's Art Deco series of books (\"French Modern,\" \"Italian
    Art Deco,\" \"British Modern,\" etc.)."

  body: "Tim and Mark,\r\n\r\nThank you for your help. Tim, I'll make sure to stick
    with the \"Hosted by...\" logo rather than the one on the business card. Mark,
    once again\u2014I have a copy of <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> with your cover, and
    I think it is great. That sweeping 1920s deco really looks good. And unfortunately,
    the only subconscious memories I have as a kid is from the eighties. (-:\r\n\r\nBut
    I've got a couple cool old book stores here in town; I bet I can find some good
    looking stuff there.\r\n\r\nIf you have some share-able fonts that might spruce
    up <em>Witnessing Life</em>, I would love to see them. \r\n\r\nThank you again!\r\n\r\n-Andy"
