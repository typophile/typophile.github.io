  I could just use your expertise.\r\n\r\nThis is on the window of an old shoe company

    T's different lengths? \r\n\r\nI'm guessing that this is the type of letter that
    influenced Gotham. If you go down the compressed end of the Gotham spectrum you
    might be getting close-ish.\r\n\r\n<cite>Public spaces are teeming with handmade
    sans serifs that share the same underlying structure, an engineer's idea of \"basic
    lettering\" that transcends both the characteristics of their materials and the
    mannerisms of their craftsmen. </cite>\r\n\r\nExtract from <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008\"

    done in old typefaces, look hand-painted to me. Reminds me shop typography in
    Vienna or Berlin from 1900-1930

    existing design. \r\nAnd since it was done in the 20s or 30s, it would have to
    have been an older face. \r\nBut you're right, Nick -- this does look like just
    the thing H&FJ were seeking to get the spirit of in Gotham."

    the 20th Century in the USA.  If there is a digital face, it copied the lettering.

    an existing design.\r\n\r\nYeah, 'The right way to sign-write letters' is a real
    but notional typeface that exists in all our heads to a lesser or greater extent,
    admit it. The one who did this had the remarkable gift of making something notional
    a physical reality. And I guess that's why Gotham has become so popular - F-J
    &co have intuitively managed to digitise something that everyone (or at least
    the vast majority) was thinking and that is surely its great strength. It's so
    familiar and that gives it, and therefore us, a great sense of confidence and
    security.\r\n\r\nLet's be clear, however, that without this sort of prehistoric
    sign-writing genius, there would be no Gotham for us all to be designing everything
    with. What do you reckon?\r\n\r\n>>>If there is a digital face, it copied the
    lettering.\r\nAnd so you could argue that there is very little authentic about
    Gotham...but who are the ones who are laughing all the way to the bank?\r\n\r\nIs
    there a thread entitled 'In praise of Gotham'? If not I might start one. \r\n"

    was a kind old guy with a bit of liquor on his breath but he patiently explained
    his whole process to the little kid with skinned knees and insatiable curiosity
    about the "mystery" of lettering. The next day, I was in my grandfathers basement,
    trying out my newly-found "obsesion" with letters.  Not much has changed in 60
    years ;-)

    reason a lot of type from the era is that way. Of course once a sign painter or
    stone carver mastered an alphabet, they would just go with it, and do their own
    variations. I don't know to what extent printed models were an influence, but
    that's what Paul Shaw said when I went on one of his \"type walks\" in New York
    City.  "
