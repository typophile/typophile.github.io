body: 'I&#39;ve done my best to buy my own software for home use and not &#34;borrow&#34;
  things from work, so the software titles I use most at home are PageSpinner, PhotoLine
  32, and CorelDraw--mostly shareware and a cheap &#40;but surprisingly nice&#41;
  Corel package. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve known for a while &#40;and submitted the problem
  to the creator&#41; that PhotoLine 32 doesn&#39;t support kerning pairs, even though
  it&#39;s supposed to. They&#39;ve kindly emailed me back and said they&#39;re trying
  to fix it. Well, just recently I discovered CorelDraw has the same problem. Here&#39;s
  the final response I got from their support: <BR> <BR>&#60;blockquote&#62;It turns
  out this is a known problem with Draw 11 for the Mac, you will have to workaround
  the problem.&#60;/blockquote&#62; <BR> <BR>I realize all I can do is change software,
  but I received a much kinder response from a German shareware developer. <BR> <BR>Anyway--just
  in case--is there any such workaround, or does this just suck for me? <BR> <BR>-Addison'
