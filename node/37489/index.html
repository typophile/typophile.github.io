  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I posted some samples of &ldquo;Tramway&rdquo; a loooong time ago (at one point I even considered to stop working on it altogether), but now I really need to finish it. Soon.</p>
<p>It is, although not finished, already being used in a german magazine, but there&rsquo;s (obviously) still a lot to do. So now I&rsquo;m reworking some stuff, adding some accents, I have totally messed up the spacing (I&rsquo;ll get to that soon), and I started with some new styles (book, black and ultra). I&rsquo;m also thinking about old style and tabular figures.</p>
<p>Right now nothing&rsquo;s really finished (well, at least not in detail – the overall design will, of course, stay like it is), but I thought I&rsquo;d post some samples anyway. Any suggestions are, as always, highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot,
Hanno</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments. I know, there&rsquo;s a LOT of squarish sans out there. I don&rsquo;t think it was quite like that, when I started drawing this one. It&rsquo;s good to hear that you think it&rsquo;s different enough, that&rsquo;s what I hoped for. I was trying to retain a certain &ldquo;sturdiness&rdquo; that, I think, sets it apart from other squarish fonts, which, for my taste, are often too clean and quiet. I think I wanted a small hint of early grotesks, not in style, but in spirit ;-)</p>
<p>Concerning the lc &ldquo;y&rdquo;: There will definitely be two versions, one will be &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and should be used in text setting. The magazine I mentioned doesn&rsquo;t use the straight &ldquo;y&rdquo; at all, but I still like it and want to keep it as an option.
I&rsquo;ll see what I can do about the &ldquo;s&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s been bugging me for some time now.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll be able to see the pdf now…</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ah, I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention before, I overlooked the &lsquo;regular&rsquo; &lsquo;y&rsquo;. That one looks fine. The only realy problematic character I see now, is the &rsquo;s'.
I think it could be a little bit smaller (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->really little<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bit), and the lower terminal  should probably be extended by a couple of units. Or the upper left &lsquo;shoulder&rsquo; could be shifted to the right a bit.</p>
<p>And I agree that it is different enough, I was just observing the fact that squarish sans serifs are quite popular at the moment. :)</p>
<p>P.s. about inserting the PDF in your first post, what does not work? Doesn&rsquo;t it upload, or doesn&rsquo;t it show? If it doesn&rsquo;t show, try browsing for the file, and submit instead of add. I guess it would be best for clarity if the PDF is in the first post (I always want to anyway). :)</p>

<p>Regardin the &ldquo;g&rdquo;: In the regular/lighter version the top bowl could go a bit more to the right. In the heavy/ultra weight it&rsquo;s perfect. But the whole font looses much of its original character.</p>

After a closer look of the s and the a, did you try to use the same angle of the top of your a bowl? I think this way could be a solution for that s. It spin seems too horizontal compare to the top bowl of the a. Good work.</p>

<p>I did some work on the diacritics and posted a new pdf. Sadly, I have to finish quite a lot of them really soon, so any suggestions are highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Chris, if you&rsquo;re talking about the &ldquo;Subtil&rdquo;-typeface, that, fortunately, was a real job. I&rsquo;m glad you like it. It is a logotype for the public services of the City of Dortmund. If you&rsquo;re interested, there are some pictures on my homepage. I#ll try to take some better photographs in the future, but you can get a little impression of how it&rsquo;s used.</p>

<p>Yes, I was referring to the &ldquo;Subtil&rdquo; typeface. Nice work.</p>
<p>Back to Tramway - I am not qualified to comment on your diatrics, but again, the face seems very solid. The only character that bothers me is the &ldquo;j&rdquo; glyph. The descender seems so sharp, to a point of distraction, but maybe it&rsquo;s just me. I would love to see it rounded out along the bottom.</p>
<p>Are you planning on releasing this for public licensing or is this a comissioned typeface?</p>
<p>Best of luck,</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was just checking the last PDF, and I like it a lot overall. But when I look at the page and not focus my attention on any particular part, I think there are some minor issues with weight distribution here and there.</p>
<p>For example, the bowls of &rsquo;d p b' seem a bit heavy, in comparison to other letters. It&rsquo;s only small differences, but to me they stand out. The weight in the &lsquo;y&rsquo; is also a bit off, I think. The right stroke should be a wee bit thinner than the left stroke. Also, but I&rsquo;m not sure, the horizontal bar in the &lsquo;k&rsquo; could be a couple of units thinner? And I agree with Chris about the &lsquo;j&rsquo;. Maybe a terminal similar to that of the &lsquo;y&rsquo; might work.</p>
<p>Well just a global observation. It&rsquo;s coming together nicely. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s great that you&rsquo;re all still interested. It looks like Tramway is going to be released in the near future, if all goes well by a foundry I respect tremendously. Therefore I&rsquo;ve been working hard to get rid of minor flaws and, most of all, expand the character set, you can see the preliminary results in the attached picture.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware that there are many fonts in the same area, but when I started this about five years ago, I don&rsquo;t think it was quite like it is today. I thought about giving up several times, but people kept asking for Tramway, so I thankfully kept going. I still think there&rsquo;s something unique about it (I don&rsquo;t even like many current squarish sans serifs - maybe that helps :-)).</p>
<p>Some selected clients are alreday using Tramway, I put together some examples…

		<div class="commentbody">Congratulations Hanno. Looking forward to seeing this available to the public. I love this &ldquo;genre&rdquo; of type, and this is a very solid addition to that group. I have to say though, the ONLY glyph that bothers me is the &ldquo;Q&rdquo; the tail is distracting in my opinion. Any reason you&rsquo;ve chosen the vertical treatment?</div>
