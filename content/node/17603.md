body: "I have been approached to layout a book in French and I was wondering if there
  is anything special I should think about before I accept or decline the project.
  My wife speaks french and was the editor of the english version of the book in question.
  She will be helping me if I accept the project. What should I know about layout
  in French that differs from what I know about laying out a book in English?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    of the prelims, whereas <em>la table des mati\xE8res</em> (the detailed list of
    contents) can be found at the end of a book. There are exceptions, though."

    is a summary, but you would probably want a French stylebook, including rules
    for the order of matter in a French book.  '

  body: I'm not concerned with the content. I'm not responsible for proofreading.
    What I'm concerned with are things like how do the french accent markes affect
    leading and letterspacing? Should I worry about hyphenation more? Stuff like that.

  body: "Josh, with all due respect, you may not be designing the book from scratch,
    but you should still be concerned with the content, IMHO.\r\n\r\nIn addition to
    Maxim's and William's suggestions, I would add that, according to Robert Bringhurst's
    <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em>, French hyphenation is different (at
    least sometimes) from English hyphenation. Perhaps there are French hyphenation
    dictionaries or plug-ins for the program you will be using to lay out the text.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    if I am not mistaken, the text on the spine of French books traditionally runs
    from the bottom up rather than from the top down."

  body: "The biggest thing you will need to address is the hyphenation but I'm not
    sure how to deal with that - I have traditionally been concerned with the other
    way around (translations into English).\r\n\r\nI agree with Ricardo that you do
    have to pay attention to the content but your wife should be able to help with
    that.\r\n\r\nThe french also use different symbols for dialogue but I assume that
    will be in the manuscript and not something you will need to format. Also, I find
    a lot of french publishers don't indent paragraphs, but I think that's weird.
    I have also learned that European book design to a large extent is far plainer
    and less decorative than American. I have no idea why this is or why it should
    be."

  body: Thank you all for your helpful comments. Just to clarify, I didn't mean that
    I wasn't concerned with the content at all, like Ricardo pointed out, my wife
    will be reviewing the book for its content. I was concerned about whether or not
    I should accept the job of laying out the book in french, not how to proofread
    it.
