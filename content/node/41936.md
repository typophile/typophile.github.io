    words using type. A very quick (and not too subtle :) example would be: \r\n.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Heavy_6190.jpg]\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nYou'll

  body: "Feraslove - I don't want to sound mean, but here at Typophile we often have
    students coming to us for advice. In general I think we aim to be as helpful as
    we can. But in your case (and we've seen this before) it seems like you are asking
    us to do your homework for you. If you want to post some samples of the work you've
    done for advice/opinions then that seems like a better approach than asking us
    to have the ideas for you. I'm sure your teacher doesn't want us doing your work
    for you.\r\n\r\nLook at the words, close your eyes, think of what comes to mind,
    and try to express that using type. Those are all potentially very visual words,
    you should be able to come up with something. Then if you want us to weigh in,
    fine."

    idea would be to find a famous quote on each of those words and try to make a

    Does it help to communicate the idea of \u2018heavy\u2019?\r\nThe layering and
    the varying sizes/colours imply a three-dimensional space. Does this help?\r\nDoes
    the overall image say \u2018heavy\u2019, or rather \u2018messy\u2019, \u2018crashing\u2019,
