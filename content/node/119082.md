body: Thought Identifont would solve this, but couldn't find anything. The lowercase
  g, with its two spurs on the right, and lowercase t with bottom serif instead of
  hook, are very distinctive. Sample is scanned from dust jacket of a book published
  2004.

  body: Gary, the name of the book (it is by Rick Gekoski, yes?) and its publisher
    might be important clues in narrowing down the tyepface....

  body: You've nailed it. Thanks! For certain purposes I think it's quite effective.
    Too bad not available commercially now. Obviously it still was in 2004, when Carroll
    & Graf Publishers put out Nabokov's Butterfly, by Rick Gekoksi (you had that right
    too).
