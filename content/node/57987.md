  body: "Certainly the overall design bears a strong resemblance to [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Handel+Gothic/|Handel
    Gothic]], but the curves are less rounded and more reminiscent of [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Eurostile/|Eurostile]].\r\n\r\nAlso
    while it doesn't quite match your example. [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/simian|Simian
    from House Industries]] is a very cool typeface that has a somewhat similar feel.\r\n\r\n"
