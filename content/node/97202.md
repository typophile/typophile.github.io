  body: "First off, find some paper texture you want to use, preferably something
    a little more contrasty in the balance of white and black. Select the texture,
    and copy it.\r\n\r\nSwitch over to the image you're working on. In your layer's
    panel in Photoshop, select the layer you want to have the effect applied to; ie,
    the type.  Click on add new layer vector mask. In your channels panel, click on
    the visibility of your newly created mask, it should by default be called, \"Layer
    Mask 1\". Paste the texture now, and you'll notice you can already see the texture
    acting as a mask; at this point you can scale or repeat the texture as needed.
    \r\n\r\nDepending on what you have resting behind the layer you've applied the
    texture mask to, you'll now be able to see through it to the layers below. You
    can sweeten the effect as needed by playing around with the opacity options, like
    multiply, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's a nice way of adding some organic \"noise\" to an otherwise
    purely digital image. By playing around with different source textures, you can
    achieve different levels of \"grunge\" to your final image.\r\n\r\nAn example
    of a vector image, that was given a coarse, cardboard finish:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/nathanielhebert/5180781017/in/photostream\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nNathaniel"
