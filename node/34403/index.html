		<div class="commentbody"><p>Christine, you might get a direct email for Licko, but not in public like this, and not just because of spambots: besides being a violation of privacy protocol, Licko is sort of the private type. One thing you might do to increase your chances (at least for your email to be passed along to her, if not the other way around) is enable the receiving of messages via Typophile, since right now:
<a href="http://typophile.com/user/19078/contact">http://typophile.com/user/19078/contact</a></p>
<p>On the other hand Rainer&rsquo;s suggestion is solid: being an admirer of Licko&rsquo;s work (as per your other post) you&rsquo;re very likely to eventually get a reply by sending a nice message to the main mailbox. On the other other hand :-) Licko is the type of designer who: might not take kindly to <cite>too much</cite> inspiration, certainly not if it involves the copy-pasting of outlines (concerning which she has a &ldquo;history&rdquo; - see the Makela case for one); but you&rsquo;re making an Arabic type (which I actually guessed after reading your other post!) so it&rsquo;s not as problematic. One encouraging thing is that Emigre has sanctioned Greek and Cyrillic derivations of their fonts. Another encouraging thing is that you&rsquo;re a woman.</p>
<p>Two more things that might or might not provide food for thought:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Everybody makes mistakes, and mistakes teach us more than correct things! In the case of Matrix many people have a problem with the &ldquo;g&rdquo;*. In fact previously on Typophile people have tried -and I think some have succeeded- in improving it: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/14378">http://typophile.com/node/14378</a> _
My point here isn&rsquo;t to bash Licko, but to alert you to the level of lucid thinking that you will need when working from Matrix (or really when making any font).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I hear somebody making a non-Latin font based on a Latin original, my alarm bells go off! Because almost all the time the non-Latin script suffers a large drop in cultural authenticity, hence functionality. The reason this happens is generally a certain ignorance of what a scipt <cite>needs</cite> to be, as opposed to what it can easily be distorted into by copy-pasting formal features from Latin. I&rsquo;ve talked about this a lot (including at conferences) and have written an article as well. A high-profile Arabic example of this problem can be seen in Abbar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arabic Univers&rdquo; work, featured in Eye magazine, and also discussed here previously:
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/3306">http://typophile.com/node/3306</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that you say you&rsquo;re making a display type attenuates both of the points above: the &ldquo;g&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t so bad for display, but to me it does prevent Matrix from being a full-fledged text font, which I personally value more; and Latinization is not nearly as damaging when it&rsquo;s done in a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; display font (even though these things do migrate to text sometimes).</p>
<p>Oh, and say hi to Lebanon for me.  :-)</p>
