  announce [[http://www.indiantypefoundry.com/news/tulika-bengali/|Tulika]], a new
  text typeface family inspired by traditional Bengali calligraphy. It features distinctive,
  sinuous shapes and a high contrast between thick and thin strokes. Bengali is one
  of the most complex Indic scripts, requiring the design of over 700 glyphs for each
  of Tulika\u2019s 5 styles. Jyotish Sonowal, in-house designer at ITF and native
  speaker of Assamese, did extensive research while defining the character set and
  included support for the Assamese, Bengali, Bishnupriya Manipuri, Garo, Kokborok,
  Meitei, and Mundari languages. Tulika is a set of Unicode fonts suitable for setting
  books, magazines, newspapers and any other material which can benefit from its five
  weights and high legibility at small point sizes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITF_Tulika_Bengali_5114.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nSatya
