body: I need help, desperate for any advice on what typeface this could be. I'm working
  for a company that has recently aquired another company who previously used a designer
  who used a particular font. The designer is now MIA, along with his wisdom into
  what font he's been using. I've been sent to re-design/ update all of the old material,
  and in all of the existing material he created he converted the fonts to outlines.
  The clients are set on using the existing typeface (I'm not fond of it myself, but
  I have to pick my battles carefully here). I've attached a sample. Help!
