  ever written with the cedilla as a continuation of the stroke? I'm thinking when
  the c doesn't connect to the next letter, as in \xE7\u2019est bon\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cestfrancais_3915.JPG]\r\n2.
  is lslash used in any languages other than Polish? and if it is, should the script
  form of lslash be default or language specific?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lodz_3991.JPG]"

    you mean by connect wave to l. You mean the slash should touch the l? I'm thinking
    I'll have a regular lslash and save the script one for a stylistic set. So it'll
    probably never be used."

  body: Yes, the cedilla can be formed in a cursive fashion based on some kind of
    reversal from the terminal. However, such a cedilla should carry some of the same
    sense of speed and of the script style, and your cedilla shape is too slow and
    formal. A shape more open, like that in the Apolline example, would be appropriate.

    a bit problematic.

  body: "From the Wikipedia article, apparently most of Poland doesn't need the \u0141
    anymore; while its sound is preserved in Eastern Poland, the rest of the country
    just pronounces it as a W. However, in Polish, W is pronounced as V, if I remember
    correctly. But then, V is also pronounced as V.\r\n\r\nSo \u0141 may be a casualty
    if Polish is ever subjected to orthographic reform. "
