  body: If it's a scribble font, could it be not based on Helvetica? Since it's not
    meant to add to the Helvetica family, you're free to be more expressive and organic
    with the shapes.

  body: "thanks for the comments. \r\n\r\ncrossgrove - i'm impressed you've recognized
    the helvetica. actually, part of the idea was to take a printed type back full
    circle to a scribble stage. not good?\r\n\r\ni'm a bit worried the vectors are
    becoming to complex when streamlining this. does anybody have any experience with
    this?"
