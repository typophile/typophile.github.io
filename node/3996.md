    of  <BR>experience. I&#39;ve never been to an art class. I <BR>dropped out of
    college after two years. If I <BR>found a sponsor, I wouldn&#39;t mind a shot
    at  <BR>Reading or Rhode Island or The Hague. But, for  <BR>now, I&#39;m going
    with what I&#39;ve got. Hmm, that was <BR>more answer than you asked for. Sorry.
    <BR> <BR>I am leaving for Sweden because I feel I belong <BR>there. My mama is
    Svensk. Our home was built  <BR>with special attention to ample light and furnished
    <BR>in scandinavian woods. Christmas was &#40;and  <BR>still is&#41; a decidedly
    Swedish affair with apples  <BR>and straw on the tree, a grand smorgasbord, and  <BR>lots
    of songs sung in her native toungue. It was  <BR>a trip to Stockholm in 2000 that
    clinched it. At  <BR>the end, I felt homesick going home. <BR> <BR>So I&#39;m
    looking for ways to make it work. There is <BR>one small possibility for a job,
    but I&#39;ve got no <BR>lodging lined up. So if you svenskers know of <BR>anything,
    please pass it along.
