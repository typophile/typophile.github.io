  body: "SEBASTIAN BURGOLD is a custom job [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Visual-identity--Sebastian-Burgold/823191|Rene
    Bieder]] but I think the great new [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Febrotesk/906092|4TH
    Febrotesk]] by Sergiy Tkatchenko matches quite perfectly.\r\nCAROGA is definitely
    [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_avant_garde_gothic_pro_virtual/|Avant-Garde
    Gothic Pro]] ([[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/itc_avant_garde_gothic_alternate/|stylistic
    alternates and ligatures]] available as opentype features).\r\nI know the last
    one but can't find at this time... I think it's a custom job for magazine... Will
    try to find some information on it."

  body: Having a closer look (mainly R and M) to the third one, could also be a custom
    based on Avant-Garde Gothic (Extra Light) and adding some connections between
    strokes (not so hard to reproduce)...
