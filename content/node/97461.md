body: "I'm designing a magazine for a religious organization which features Goudy
  Sans in their identity (in all caps). I've paired it with Gotham and Cochin in other
  materials. I want to swap out Cochin for a more versatile, serifed type. I'm also
  trying to give the magazine a more playful, modern look, and have used Goudy Sans
  bold in the title in lower case. (Modern Arts and Crafts?)\r\n\r\n I'm working with
  a designer who has brought in Bulmer, but I find it to be heavy as body text. Gotham
  could also be swapped out.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for a serifed typeface for the
  body and a sans serif  to marry well with Goudy Sans? I've also thought of losing
  it altogether in the interior. But then it might look altogether foreign to their
  brand\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your suggestions!"

    your other concerns, this approach makes perfect sense. Very few magazines\u2014<em>The
    New Yorker</em> being a highly notable exception\u2014tie their interior typography
    to their masthead logotype\u2026"

  body: "Good point Nick.\r\nThe cap A in Goudy Sans is a bit rich for most layout
    uses, except perhaps the occasional drop cap.\r\nHowever, there are several contemporary
    humanist sans faces which convey something of the slightly rough-hewn, somewhat
    condensed, tiny-serifed (glyphic) quality of Goudy Sans.\r\nIdeal Sans, Winco,
    Grotext, or my own Sensibility, for instance.\r\n"

  body: 'I think a text serif that would harmonize would be something with a hand
    modeled, humanist feeling, and some softness. Goudy Old Style will work much better
    than Cochin, I would think. And, may I say, my own [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|Williams
