  [[http://www.remix-tools.com|www.remix-tools.com]].\r\n\r\nThe Remix Tools got some
  new features and a few extra tools.\r\nAlso, I have produced some screencasts so
  you can have a look at what they do before you install them.\r\n\r\nThe Font Remix
  Tools are a set of plug-ins for FontLab Studio that allow scaling of glyphs without
  affecting the stroke weight. You can use them to tune the width, height and weight
  of single letters interactively, automatically generate small caps, superiors, inferiors,
  numerators and denominators, create true condensed and extended versions, generate
  tabular figures with only a couple of clicks, and slant glyphs while keeping vertical
  tangents straight.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"

  body: Not being a type designer, I can't fully judge the usefulness of these tools,
    but the results are very convincing. It seems you've added a wealth of time saving
    bits to the FontLab toolkit. And the videos prove it. Really nice work, Tim.

  body: "Thanks, Jos!\r\n\r\nPablo, yes, the Harmonizer will definitely be released
    very soon, SpotOn hopefully soon after, and the Equalizer probably at some point,
    I don't think it is that urgent."
