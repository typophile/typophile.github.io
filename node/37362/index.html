<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>hi guys,
I just joined this forum and I am very interested to learn more about typography.
FYI, I was a student in graphic design program but I dropped out after my first year because I just don't have enough money to continue so, while I am trying to save the money, I was thinking to keep on practice because I am still not very clear when to stop or dram the line what is good enough.
I have few books about typography from my class textbook
The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst
Thinking with Type by Ellen Lupton
Typography Workbook: A Real-World Guide to Using Type in Graphic Design by Timothy Samara
The Ten Commandments of Typography by Paul Felton and Jonathan Barnbrook
but I need to say that I am not very book person :(
I am just wondering what is the best practice for me to do it daily?
I am more than willing to make a commitment to my self to sit for 2-3 hours every single day and only to play around with typography (I have two jobs).
For my future goal, I just want to work around typography, publication,web/motion and branding. My current goal is want to have a better handle of kerning, spacing, and choosing the right combination of font type for poster design.
Plus, I want to learn how I can create my own type face.
I was thinking to took some words from magazine articles/lyrics, type it manually, and play around so, I can have better handle at spacing and kerning but I dunno.
by the way, is they any some kind of online courses (small budget) for typography?
thanks guys

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, replies are scarce in here. This is sort of the ghetto of the site, and few people visit here. You are not being ignored, but just not seen.
I would post your questions in the main forum, where they will get more attention.</div>
