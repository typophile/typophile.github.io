  reading you, interesting topics by passioned people (this is not shoes polish at
  all).\r\nI was looking around about blackletters and found this interesting image.
  \r\nIt looks like Old English or Gothique with some kind of a Fraktur emphasis but
  I believe it's custom work but not sure, so if you have any ideas, thx"

  body: Almost for sure custom work, as evidenced by the two different "R" characters
    for "Rock" and "Roll", respectively.

  body: Yes, I noticed it, but is this just some custom redraw of ligatures and ornements
    from some blackletter font or a full custom job ?

  body: "Most of that, including the first R, matches Kanzlei Bold, stretched vertically
    a bit. The two digital versions I'm aware of are Dieter Steffmanns <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/f/fettekanz.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Fette Kanzlei</a> and Paul Lloyd's <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/blackjewels/index.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Plain Germanica</a> (listed as Germanica).\r\n\r\nThe top of
    the k and l, as well as the tail swashes on the C and second R will require custom
    work."

    digitalizing those Blackletter fonts (as background work to find some of them
    I believe), a lot that I never saw anywhere else before."
