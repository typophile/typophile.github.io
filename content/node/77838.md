  for some time now and I must say, It's a great way to learn how to design a typeface!
  Many thanks to all the vokes who have helped me with my typefaces =D However, I
  wonder if it's safe. Jos buivenga shares his work on flickr during the design process,
  so I always assumed the risk wasn't that big, but I wonder if there's anyone of
  you who had someone else steal his/her concept after having posted it on typophile.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper de Waard"

    somebody reply by trashing the client. Google finds it really fast, and before
    long, your client is firing you. I had it happen to me. That's why I don't post
    any work in progress anymore. Sad, but it's the only way to protect my business.
    \r\n\r\nThat's also why I never, ever use my name online for <b>anything</b> unless
    I have total control of the website. Ever!"

    the extent of my involvement in dog racing is strictly confined to getting drunk
    with my musher friends and being grateful their dog team can get us home safe.
    \r\n\r\nBy the way, if you've ever experienced the drunken room spins, a dog sled
    ride is ill advised. :o "

  body: "I think the real risk is not to be copied from someone just lazy who will
    not have the skills to create a good font. My fear is about designers (with at
    least some graphic qualities) who are also developing a font and see your work
    as a possible \"improvement\" to their.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this fear was not enough
    to keep me far away from Critique section as my own project is there. What I learnt
    from typophilers opinions was so much valuable to stop posting the font development."
