  in my not-so-humble opinion, I'm ready for something else. Even a non-sponsored
  face for a while...

    Typophile to implement. While a daily or weekly font rotation is wonderful in
    theory, it would add a lot more work for our friends in the administration arena.
    The idea of having a sponsored typeface is to help generate revenue to keep this
    community going. I'm glad they've come up with ideas like this so we aren't subjected
    to zillions of Google ads and annoying ads from media farms.\r\n\r\nJust saying

  body: "There's not just programming to consider, but solicitation of new faces,
    negotiations, contracts/license agreements, vetting each typeface, bug-testing,
    etc. Even small chunks of time add up, and take away from running a business and
    working on a zillion other bug fixes and new features that we request. I don't
    exactly know what goes on under the hood, but I know a ton of work goes into programming
    and administering every aspect of this site and it's all a labor of love that
    we benefit from.\r\n\r\nI've personally grown fond of Super Duty and its strength
    in this application, as I did Beorcana before it - I would echo Eric's sentiments.
    I'm not sure that I would enjoy a constantly rotating font in all the headers.
    I mean, I love to see different fonts, but there is a certain comfort factor in
    coming to Typophile and seeing a consistent look over a period of time. I like
    the warm fuzziness and stability of it all.\r\n\r\nOf course I look forward to
    being pleasantly surprised when a new typeface is introduced here, but it will
    be a bit of a shock to the system.\r\n\r\nI don't know what the fees for featured
    faces are, but the folks at Typophile have mentioned this sponsorship program
    in multiple threads and said interested parties should email them. So that's what
    I would do."

    from Super Duty as you do? I've grown to quite loathe the typeface as a result
    of its use on this site. But I might be the only one. I was sad when Beorcana
    was taken down. That was a nice font for this purpose, in my opinion. I will honestly
    state that I'm probably the least qualified to speak on such matters, though.

    Hard over and over. But, Jimmy G is an awesome designer and the font has its purposes.
    I was one who didn't really like Beorcana for this purpose and was happy to see
