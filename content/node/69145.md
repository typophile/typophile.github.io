  body: "Welcome to Typophile Jessica. In the future if you could post smaller images,
    we'd be able to see it better without scrolling across the screen. I think the
    FAQ suggests a max of 500 pixels width (or so).\r\n\r\nMcDonald's logo is almost
    surely custom, just because they are McDonald's, but you could fake it by finding
    any Sans with a splayed M and using the 'o' to make the 'c' (with parallel jaws).
    The 'a' might also need some work, but pick one with a straight tail and you are
    mostly there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
