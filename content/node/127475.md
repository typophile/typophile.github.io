  body: "It appears to be custom, since I'm finding nothing that matches exactly.\r\n\r\nFor
    the G, FF Zwo, by Fontshop/J\xF6rg Hemker, is the closest match I could find.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of the letters, PF DIN Text Bold comes close, but is still a bit off for
    the R, A and P (width, shape of the counters):\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-text-pro/\r\n\r\nIf
    you want one typeface that approximates the overall look, try Program:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/program/\r\n"
