  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello fellow Typophiles!
My name is Jordan Bell and I have been working on this Sans for about 3 months now. I study graphic design and typography at Abilene Christian University as a junior and have taken an Intro to Typography course. I realized at the beginning of this semester that I am hopelessly obsessed with typography. So, I started drawing! It started with sketches inspired by fonts such as Info, Dekar, Titillium, and Klavika. I then decided to try to learn how to use Fontlab Studio 5. After reading lots of reviews, tutorials, and blogs, I started drawing in Fontlab and Illustrator. In other words, I am a beginner.</p>
<p>After many, many hours hovering over my laptop, editing, analyzing and tweaking this font, my professor told me I need some other professional critique. So, here I am! Please be gentle though. This is the first typeface I have designed and I know there are some kerning and small design problems, but I really would like to hear what you pro&rsquo;s have to say about the design and readability of the characters. But really, I&rsquo;ll take any feedback good or bad.</p>
<p>btw, I have updated the examples! The first two are former comps. The last 2 are the newest and best examples. Please review and critique. Thanks for any potential help!Enjoy</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I can certainly see the Titillium and Klavika influences. There&rsquo;s also a fair bit of Interstate in there as well, I think. Your challenge should be to differentiate it from Titillium, because at the moment, they are remarkably close. A few comments:</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks CaleD for your comments!
Have you ever finished writing a paper, print it out, then notice like, 10 mistakes? Thats kinda what happened to me here. Right as I posted those, I noticed quite a few problems. I agree with everything that you stated and I am currently editing them now. As for the P terminal, I have thought about adding it to the other applicable characters, but really wanted some feedback on it first; so this helps out alot! Now, to the Titillium reference, I did hand draw all these on Fontlab, so its not like I copied them or anything, but your right. I should try to make some of the very similar characters more unique. 
Once again, thanks for the suggestions!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">the italic /Q/s all have dissonant tails to their regular counterparts. I like how the regular /Q/s do not let their tails into their counters, however the italics do. if that makes sense.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah yes, the italic Q. I have spent many hours over the Q and it still fails me. Do you think I should change the Italic Q so that the tails are all the same and not in the counter? Or do you think they are ok? I mean, There is still some cleaning up to do with the tails, but what do you think?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have been doing more work on this typeface in the past couple of weeks so I posted up some more example sheets (v3). Currently I am adding more glyphs - working on old-style numerals, automatic and discretionary ligatures - hoping that this will make my family  larger more complete and impressive. Even though it is still in progress, I would like more feedback please! I will be posting updates soon probably. 
Thanks all for any potential help,</p>
