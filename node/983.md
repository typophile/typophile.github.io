body: Hi Folks. The search isn&#39;t available on Adobe&#39;s site right now, in the
  User to User forums, and I&#39;m in a pickle!!!  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got an Illustrator
  10 file. Some type as type, some type as outline, some basic vector shapes. No Transparency
  trickery. When I print it out of Illustrator all looks fine. When I export it as
  a PDF, vector hell. When I export it as Illustrator 10 or 8 EPS and drop that on
  distiller, vector hell. I should mention that the type as type looks fine, but the
  outline type &#40;or the type that is type but has outlines&#41; looks jaggy. <BR>
  <BR>Ideas? This could earn you drinks or desert at ATypI or the next TypeCon.  <BR>
  <BR>Help me please Obi Wan.

    and that didn&#39;t solve a single thing.

  body: Tiffany - can you save it as an eps, Illustrator 9. <BR> <BR>Then open Ill.
    9 &#40;do you still have?&#41; and output <BR>the pdf from Ill. 9. <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: 'No. I&#39;m one of those types that deleted Illustrator 9. <BR> <BR>UPDATE:
    I&#39;m pretty sure the problem lies within the &#34;compress text and line art&#34;
    function. When I saved it as a PDF, just now, turning that off and saving it as
    PDF 4 not 5, it printed smoothly. But, I don&#39;t trust Illustrators PDF features,
    so I&#39;d still like to get this to work using distiller.'

  body: Have you checked the resolution / rendering settings of the filter/effects
    of Illustrator10/9. - 300 dpi? Depending on the rip 300/320 dpi should be nice.
    The other truth is, to avoid the usage of such effects on a printer without postscript
    level3 rip. <BR> <BR>Personally speaking, these pixel effects are the stupist
    feature Adobe have added in the last years to Illustrator. <BR> <BR>BTW. This
    is not an Illustrator support forum. ;-&#41;

    is with the printed piece. <BR> <BR>Everyone -- Acrobat 6 Professional is for
    smart people. Of which I&#39;m obviously not included. :^&#40;

  body: As all of you were willing to discuss this with me, even if only momentarily,
    I thought I&#39;d share my findings at the end of this &#34;sadly painful and
    now much in need of a deep tissue message&#34; day. <BR> <BR>1&#41; In Illustrator.
    &#34;Save as PDF&#34; is bad. 2&#41; Printing in Illustrator, with Acrobat 6 Professional
    installed, choose Acrobat as your printer. This works, and works well. <BR> <BR>The
    weirdness is beyond weird and far beyone twilight zone. But anyone that has ever
    worked with me knows that the &#34;code of the west&#34; doesn&#39;t always apply.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks Jared &amp; Joe for letting me use the forums for this.

    its checked. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think this is available on Acrobat earlier than
    v4.

  body: Hi Tiffany, even if illustor or Indesign offers you the possibility of making
    PDFs, the best results are from using distiller. The safest results &#40;for the
    industry and to be sure they&#39;ll probably work&#41; is made with acrobat &#40;distiller&#41;
    4.0.5, although I haven&#39;t tried 6.0 yet. <BR> <BR>---Jacques

  body: James -- Thanks for the info. I realized that you were meaning preview &#40;after
    looking at your grabs&#41;. My curve flatness problem was occurring on the printed
    piece. And what&#39;s stranger is the fact that BJ didn&#39;t have the problem.
    So... Who knows! But thanks for your two bits, I was wondering where this pref
    was, and now I know. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Hi Jacques -- With the NEW &amp; IMPROVED Acrobat Professional they have set
    up a printer for the user. So when I print, I print to Acrobat, which uses Distiller.
    Pretty cool, actually. &#40;Once I remembered it was there!!&#41;

  body: Acrobat 5 set up distiller as a printer.  It also set up PDF Writer as a printer
    too, though PDF Writer seemed very crappy.
