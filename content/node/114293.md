body: "Hello! \r\nI am a student of second year of MA and Im analyzing visual elements
  of cookbooks from Warsaw, from the xix and xx century. \r\n\r\nOne of my issues
  is the analysis of the cover pages, the materials from which the book was done (
  paper type, bookbinding) \r\n\r\nDo you have knowledge and you can recommend me
  books that talk aboout such topics, for example, which materials were used in production
  of books (XIX and XX century)? \r\n\r\nIf not, do you know someone or a place where
  could I ask this question? \r\n\r\nI have read some of the material how the book
  was made but i wanted something more specific about paper and bookbinding. \r\n\r\ni
  will be glad to here from you :)\r\n"
