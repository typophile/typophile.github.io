  body: "This is pretty good. Granted, I'm not a big fan of the square bodied sans
    (with some exceptions), but for one of that genre it stands up well.\r\n\r\nThe
    space inside some of the ligatures is kind of tight, and I don't think making
    ligatures off the arm of the \"r\" is such a good idea. I know that r makes a
    big negative space that wants to be filled, but doing so makes it hard to recognize.
    Some end-user might even foolishly kern the r too close to the n in an attempt
    to make it match the other r ligatures, which would result in a shape indistinguishable
    from the m."

  body: "Thanks a lot for commenting cuttlefish!! :D\r\n\r\nThat makes sense. Do you
    thing I should remove all contextual substitutions with r (its not a ligature)
    or just particular ones? Could a kerning adjustment solve the readability issue?
    \r\nThere is no possibility that an end-user kerns it too close to n, as the only
    user of the font will be me and any employees of the company (which currently
    only has 1 employee, so that's quite easy to avoid). As I said, it won't be sold
    or given away, its aimed just for the company's corporate identity and any projects
    it owns.\r\nAlso, which ligatures (or contextual sbustitutions) do you think have
    tight counters? Does this occur in all sizes on just particular ones? (I know
    that my hinting sucks on some letters :-()\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: "It's the \"re\" combination that stands out the most to me. It's not entirely
    illegible, but it is odd, the combination not quite being readable as the letters
    separately. \r\n\r\nBesides, there's also my pet peeve about a \"rn\" couple getting
    slightly overinked or kerned too close and becoming an \"m\", a problem I've seen
    happen with many font. I'm mentioning it in hopes you can take steps in the design
    to prevent that sort of collision."

  body: "@cuttlefish: Thanks for your followup! I was afraid you'd say this, as the
    re combination also appears in the logo, so that would mean that the logo should
    change as well. If I adjust the kerning, do you think it will improve or its hopeless?\r\nYou
    are right about the rn, I'll think what I can do about it. Although, since I'm
    going to be mostly using it, and I don't plan to make the kerning different than
    the default (since I planned the default :P), if I properly adjust it in the kern
    feature and ovserve it in various sizes I guess it will be okay, right?\r\n\r\n@all:
    Any comments on the glyphs? One concern that I have is that I think (and 2 people
    that have seen the font confirmed that) the H,K and X look a lot alike in small
    sizes. Also, I'm sceptical about the shape of my g."

  body: It's OK for logos to have unusual ligatures or other shapes that aren't in
    the font. You wouldn't have to remove that joint, but do consider giving the "re"
    in the logo a little more air to make up for it.

    when it isn't connected to anything.\r\n\r\nSorry to say it, but the ss thing
    just doesn't work. It pushes the esses much too far apart, giving the impression
    that the extra stroke between them must be a letter, so it reads like \"sis\"
    if anything."

  body: "Thanks for commenting cerulean!\r\n\r\nThe isolated s has terrible hinting,
    and even though I tried hard to fix it (it was even worse before), it still looks
    bad, especially on small sizes. I guess this is why you suggested changing it,
    right? It doesn't actually look that bad... If only I figure out how to correctly
    hint it...\r\n\r\nThanks to your comment, I noticed that actually, the double
    (triple, etc...) esses don't have the same distance from the joining stroke (it's
    very apparent on the logo), which increases the effect that you mentioned. I'll
    add that to the list of things I need to fix (together with cuttlefish's suggestion),
    thanks. :) I can't ditch them completely though, especially for them I considered
    the readability issue a lot since they are in the logo too, designed LOTS of alternative
    joins (more than 20 I think!) and finally decided to go with looks on this particular
    one (by the way, the logo in the demo picture is a mix of contextual alternates
    and a ligature, not a copy-paste of the original one. In the actual logo, the
    esses have equal distance from the joining stroke). Its the only glyph (actually
    it consists of more than one, but that's a technicality) that I have given so
    much thought about, and designed so many alternatives, so I won't ditch it, sorry.
    Tell me to change anything in the font, any glyph, any metric, just not my beloved
    esses (and the ff ligature), these are my favorites! :'-("

    Kerned the esses better\r\n3. Fixed hinting a bit (although I have no idea if
