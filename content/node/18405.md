  raw type. So here is a logotype Im designing. Its only on stage 1.\r\nWell this
  is a weird logotype because its unconventional. Sort of a hybrid bearing serifs
  for the upper acscender and serif for the lower.\r\n\r\nAny help/comments is appreciated
  very much."

  body: "Hi Prakash,\r\nI think the concept for the face is good. It is a little hard
    to comment further until the sketch is developed. I would suggest that the s is
    a little out of character, but I can kind of see where you are going with it.
    You probably need to keep going with.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nJason."
