  body: "It looks close to <strong>Burgues Script</strong> by Alejandro Paul [2007]
    but I can't find these specific stylistic alternates of your sample:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/burgues-script/"

  body: "If you take Burgues and give it a negative skew (slant the letters back toward
    vertical, but not too far), you've got a pretty great match for the lowercase
    in the sample. The h and k variations could have been adapted from the th or tth
    glyphs, and the g and C wouldn't be too hard to edit to get the finished results
    (just refine the terminal strokes).\r\n\r\nThe L actually looks a bit like the
    L in another Sudtipos typeface\u2014Feel Script. Marry some of its attributes
    with Burgues, and you're not too far off:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/feel-script/\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "EDITED:\r\nSo this is what Burgues Script looks like with a 20 degree slant
    to the left, with no other edits:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BurguesScriptSlantLeft20Deg_6582.jpg]\r\nPerhaps
    could benefit from horizontal compression.\r\nAt 90% width:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BurguesScriptSlantLeft20DegWidth90pct_4606.jpg]\r\nAt
    80% width:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BurguesScriptSlantLeft20DegWidth80pct_6376.jpg]\r\nWorth
    trying some other slant & compression combinations, e.g 15 degrees & 80%.\r\nDon"
