  body: My guess about the attachment is this forum hasn't supported png formats.
    Check FAQ to see if thats the problem.

  body: Well, you can upload a file with an ampersand in the name, but you have to
    change the ampersand to %26 in the URL. Obviously the forum software ought to
    do that automatically, but in the mean time the attachment is <a href="http://typophile.com/system/files?file=fathers%26families.png">here</a>.
    So get IDing, type fiends! :-)
