  body: It&#39;s not an easy question anyway &#40;and also, it could be more specific&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I think there are some works from Japan, in the &#39;80s &#40;logos,
    posters, packaging&#41;, that can be considered influential for Western &#40;commercial&#41;

  body: '&#34;Oriental&#34; is not considered a respectful term these days. It is
    also vague. There is important work by Edward Said on &#34;orientalism,&#34; by
    which he means West Asia, or what is sometimes called the Middle East. <BR> <BR>The
    question, as Eduardo notes, is much too broad to be answered usefully. Asia accounts
    for three-fifths of the world&#39;s population. It is extraordinarily diverse.
    Its traditions are ancient and distinguished. You could say that most of the world&#39;s
    design work <i>is</i> Asian, and to ask how it &#34;influenced&#34; design, as
    if design were some Western thing, is remarkably short-sighted.  <BR> <BR>A more
    useful approach would be to look at the influence of one area of Asia -- East
    Asia &#40;Japan, Korea, China&#41; for example, or, better, just one culture --
    in a particular style or period. <BR> <BR>Around the beginnings of the common
    era there was a lively interchange along the Silk Road between Persia and China
    &#40;to cite just one example of influence&#41;, which had a distinct influence
    on the development of Western art.'

    <BR> <BR>If you Google Ukiyo-e I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a lot more information.

  body: Thanks a lot Zara. <BR> <BR>So then maybe I should be asking about chinese
    and japanese influences to the european and american modern design.

  body: 'Good idea Hector, Asian influence on western design is a very broad topic
    in general, modern design is certainly a good place to start. As I said before,
    the Japanese woodblock prints are a good resource '
