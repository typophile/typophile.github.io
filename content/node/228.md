body: Just curious --- what is the difference between  <BR>Neue Helvetica &amp; Helvetica.
  This is the info at linotype  <BR> <BR>&#34;Over the years, Helvetica was expanded
  to include many different weights, but these were not coordinated with each other.In
  1983, D. Stempel AG redesigned and digitized the &#34;Neue Helvetica&#34; typeface
  for Linotype and made it a self-contained font family. Today, this family consists
  of 51 different font weights.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Just curious why there is a nearly
  $250.00 price difference between the two packages.............

  body: '$250 package of Neue Helvetica will have 51 variations in weight and width,
    from narrow to extended. Unlike Helvetica, Neue Helvetica family has consistent
    design throughout. Helvetica had been copied and redesigned and over and over
    again so that it doesn&#39;t really have consistent style anymore. For example,
    Helvetica will probably come with Helvetica Narrow, but the design of Helvetica
    Narrow should really be considered different font...  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m really
    an anti-Helvetica and anti-swiss style, but if I have to use Helvetica, I use
    Neue, because its elegant and refined design shows that the I care about choice
    of typography, and I didn&#39;t just pick Helvetica because it came with your
    mac. '

  body: Of course MacOS X has some weights of Helvetica Neue included, so soon everyone
    will be using it in conjunction with the much-maligned Comic Cans in PowerPoint
    presentations all over the western world.

  body: oh sweet sweet helvetica. it is one of the more handsome modernist faces out
    there. you guys should stop worrying about the fact that is comes standard on
    the mac. have you guys ever seen a mac &#60;joke&#62;? they are the designers
    computer so it&#39;s no wonder that they use such a beautiful type specimen as
    a standard face. <BR> <BR>just because everyone now has access to a beautiful
    typeface does not mean they will make beautiful designs. if you are in fact good
    your jobs are still safe.

    Point and Comic Sans-dom, why not start a rumor that Courier is really, really
    cool?

  body: 'Tracy, LOL <BR> <BR>Hey, this thread is spicing up unexpectedly after being  <BR>dormant
    for, like, what? Two weeks? I think this discussion  <BR>is somewhat irrelevant,
    as you can&#39;t argue about taste. <BR>I still think DJ Anzai&#39;s entry made
    truckloads of sense. <BR> <BR>Arguments about the intrinsic artistic qualities
    of type designs  <BR>only go as far as till you reach the point where personal  <BR>taste
    comes into play. <i>De gustibus et coloribus</i> yadda yadda... <BR> <BR>Jay,
    if you like Helvetica: good for you. Tracy, if you  <BR>dislike Helvetica, good
    for you too. If everybody liked the  <BR>same typeface, there&#39;d be only one,
    and that&#39;d make me  <BR>very unhappy &#40;err... actually... let me think.
    In that case  <BR>I would also only like that same typeface, so I wouldn&#39;t  <BR>know
    any better. Which means I would <i>not</i> be unhappy,  <BR>on the contrary! Ouch,
    head hurtz... ;&#41; &#41; <BR> <BR>Let me finish my entry with two quotes which
    had a profound  <BR>influence on my practice as a [typo]graphic designer: <BR>
    <BR><b>One can make a beautiful design with an ugly typeface.</b> <BR>Wolfgang
    Weingart <BR> <BR><b>There are no bad typefaces, only bad typographers.</b> <BR>Mr.
    Jeffrey Keedy <BR> <BR> <BR>There <i>is</i> a point to be made about Comic Sans,
    though... =D'

    some serious Jehovas Witness-style efforts&#41; who had grown sick of it that
    he refused to use it. <BR> <BR>As for Comic Sans, it just has this, this feeling
    to it; I&#39;ll forever associate it with Garage Sale signs and Lost Dog posters.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;Though I must confess, I&#39;ve long admired Courier&#39;s Q&#41;

  body: I live in Washington DC and the local ABC television station uses Comic Sans
    as the typeface for their weather report graphics! Big huge maps of the U.S. with
    goofy, pathetic Comic Sans spelling out &#34;RAIN&#34; &#34;LOW PRESSURE ZONE,&#34;
    the temperatures, etc. As bad as the letters look, I think the numbers look even
    worse. They superimpose giant numbers next to the weatherman to indicate &#34;today&#39;s
    high temperature&#34; and it looks like Comic Sans figures that are about nine
    feet high. Truly awful. It looks like psychotic children have taken over the place!
