  body: More reports trickle in. Apparently Rick took his own life earlier today.
    He had suffered from almost crippling tinnitus for years and apparently was unable
    to take it any longer. I keep hoping this is some kind of sick joke but three
    people have confirmed this so I guess it's true.

    body: "jlt, sadly these reports are true, I knew Rick since I was barely able
      to walk. He was one of my dad's best friends, and in the last few months my
      father (Thom Marchionna) had been helping Rick out in trying to help him with
      work and his personal issues. Rick was one of those guys who I looked up to
      as a kid and still do, he was and still is the funniest and smartest men I've
      ever had the honor of knowing.\r\n\r\nRick had been fighting depression due
      to his health, and while I know the details of what happened I feel it inappropriate
      to mention them here.\r\n\r\nHowever please contact me at isaac@lawndartdesign.com.
      I feel it important that his friends honor Rick as the amazingly talented, smart,
      and funny man he was, rather then what his illness had made him become. A great
      human being I hope wherever he his he's at peace."

      body: Rick was a great friend.  I have known him since our 2nd year at Miami
        University in 1971.  We shared a house in our last year there.  When I went
        to Australia in 1975 his was one the hardest goodbyes I had to make.  He was
        smart, witty and extremely fun to be around.  I have spent most of the years
        inbetween in Australia so haven't seen a lot of him since then.  We kept in
        touch and I followed his career in what ever way I could.  Those of you who
        know him will agree that he was a brilliant graphic designer.  Not just in
        an artistic sense, but also in the wit and fun he incorporated in all his
        work.  I miss him enormously.  Yes he was a great human being.  I too hope
        that he is at peace.

    be coming from the heart of a maverick.

  body: 'A gentle correction: Rick is officially missing. That''s what''s really known
    at this time. A San Jose police detective is working on the case. People can go
    to www.wadc.org for information - the Western Art Directors Club has a page that
    will be updated as information comes in. And you can sign up to be kept informed
    or to participate in events as appropriate. It''s hard as hell to wait, but that''s
    where we are with things right now. '

    more than rumors, and I am sorry I helped propagate them.

    had an article the day before that. Both contained what I believe are inaccuracies
    regarding his disappearance, but confirmed Rick's popularity, renown and dedication
    to his work and ideals. He is missing, and the loss weighs heavily indeed for
    many, many people.\r\n\r\nAgain, I think the best place to check for information
    is http://www.wadc.org"

  body: "Rick Tharp\u2019s Body Found \r\nPositive identification was made last night
    July 18th after the Contra Costa Coroner\u2019s office finished dental DNA testing.
    \r\nRicks body was found July 7th. Family members were not contacted until the
    news article came out in the Contra Costa times on July 15th and was spotted by
    a friend, who kindly called. Rick Tharp\u2019s request to be cremated can now
    be carried out. \r\nThe Article in the Contra Costa News reads: \r\nCoroner's
    deputies are asking for the public's help in identifying a body found floating
    in the San Francisco Bay. \r\nThe Yerba Buena Coast Guard recovered the body of
    a man south of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, west of the Richmond Shoreline
    near Red Rock on July 7, according to a press release. \r\nThe remains were turned
    over to the Contra Costa Coroner's Office at the Richmond Marina. \r\nAn autopsy
    determined the man died of multiple blunt force trauma consistent with a fall
    from a bridge or other high structure, the coroner's office said. \r\nThe coroner
    believes the body was in the water for about a month, making fingerprint identification
    impossible. Dental and DNA results are pending. \r\nThe victim was described as
    white or Latino and approximately 5-feet-8-inches tall. He was wearing Calvin
    Klein briefs with white-trim and black-and-gray Nike gym shoes without socks.
