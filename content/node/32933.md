body: "I have a relatively new iMac and I'm noticing on this screen that viewing a
  document in either Quark or InDesign at 100% is quite misleading. In fact I pulled
  out a ruler and figured out that viewing a doc at 137% gives me accurate size. Of
  course I print things out to really check my font size etc but I'm wondering when
  the software companies will get with the program (so to speak) and recalibrate.
  I still have an old CRT monitor where the files now look HUGE but are in fact more
  accurately sized at 100%.\r\n\r\nThis also hearkens to the earlier (endless) conversation
  about dpi's relevance to the web. Conclusion of course that the term \"dpi\" is
  irrelevant, it's pixels we're dealing with, but I remember the conversation turning
  to whether to work in 96 vs 72 dpi. 96 is 133% larger than 72 - which is pretty
  close to my Quark mark-up. Given this it seems that for wysiwyg we should be working
  in 96 dpi as a default when preparing p-shop files for the web."

    that the design application can do much about it. It's an operating system issue.
    The operating system has no idea how physically big your monitor is, so really
    has no way of knowing what 'true size' really is. It has to assume x pixels =
    x inches even though even monitor is different.\r\n\r\nThat said, it would be
    nice to maybe have some sort of calibration option within the DTP application.
    Of course, if someone goes and changes your screen resolution, that get screwed
    up again. ;0)\r\n\r\n\"Given this it seems that for wysiwyg we should be working

    need to work at in photoshop is where 1 pixel of your image takes up 1 pixel of
    your screen. I don't know what photoshop defaults too for that. It maybe 72dpi
    or 96dpi or (more accurately) maybe it's just a 'full size' setting somewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'That meaurement is only right when your monitor is 72 pixels/inch. If the
    pixels are smaller (higher monitor resolution), everything is scaled down. In
    practice, this can help you (more pixels are better, right?). But it does mean
    that those rulers or percentages are wrong;  So you might ignore them completely,
    since that standard resolution is being replaced or superseded. Unless the DTP
    app can somehow be told the actual monitor resolution and then calculate the true
    size, those numbers will be meaningless. If you want to be able to have this "100
    percent" view, zoom in until your onscreen page is the same size as the printed
    page and then save or remember that zoom factor. '

    I hate the way it automatically centers the page you click on, meaning if you're

    viewing distance and even contrast can alter how we perceive scale. Unfortunately,
    simply altering the zoom level of your on screen document to match the physical
    dimensions won't give you an accurate picture of what it will look like, as evidenced
    by the comment, \"the files now look HUGE\".\r\n\r\nI do a lot of work for mobile
    phone screens that have an effective resolutions anywhere from 72 to 150 dpi.
    It's amazing how the visual relationships and hierarchies change when I move things
    from the 96 dpi computer monitor to much higher resolution phone screens.\r\n\r\nOne
    time we wanted to run some tests on some designs before we had access to the target
    device, so we printed them out. The designs looked way too small. Oddly enough,
    though, they looked great on the actual device once we got them on there. Somehow
    on the bright backlit screen of the device they looked way larger then the print
    outs, even though they were exactly the same size and resolution at around 150ppi."

    the screen was designed to be 72dpi. So at least to start with, it all worked

    independence will be built into Leopard, expected this June. From Apple's Leopard
    developer pages (http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/):\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    old assumption that displays are 72dpi has been rendered obsolete by advances
    in display technology. Macs now ship with displays that sport native resolutions
    of 100dpi or better. Furthermore, the number of pixels per inch will continue
    to increase dramatically over the next few years. This will make displays crisper
    and smoother, but it also means that interfaces that are pixel-based will shrink
    to the point of being unusable. The solution is to remove the 72dpi assumption
    that has been the norm. In Leopard, the system, including the Carbon and Cocoa
    frameworks, will be able to draw user interface elements using a scale factor.
    This will let the user interface maintain the same physical size while gaining
    resolution and crispness from high dpi displays.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>The introduction
    of resolution independence may mean that there is work that you\u2019ll need to
    do in order to make your application look as good as possible. For modern Cocoa
    and Carbon applications, most of the work will center around raster-based resources.
    For older applications that use QuickDraw, more work will be required to replace
    QuickDraw-based calls with Quartz ones.</cite>\r\n\r\nIndeed, there is some resolution
    independence already in 10.4 Tiger. Geek out below:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/GraphicsImaging/RN-ResolutionIndependentUI/\r\n\r\n\r\n"
