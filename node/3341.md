  body: Michael, if you send me your e-mail contact information &#40;to tiro&#60;at&#62;tiro.com&#41;,
    I&#39;ll put you in touch with Fiona. Much of the work she did for Linotype is
    not currently available, as it has not been converted for today&#39;s technology
    yet, which is why you won&#39;t find much of it online. I&#39;m sure Fiona would
    be happy to send you photocopies of old samples and answer your questions.
