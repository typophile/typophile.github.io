  body: "Mille grazie, Riccardo ;^D\r\n\r\nChris: Usually, if you edit your own posts,
    it doesn't change the timestamp. In this forum if you edit your post it goes down
    to the thread (even the initial post was done some time before). That confuses
    the threads massively, because if you want to read threads with a lot of posts
    (which aren't sorted chronologically because of some editing) one will not understand
    some of the posts. \r\n\r\nIn this case, I edited my own post and sounded like
    an echo after Riccardo posted the same answer \u2026 So I gave the \xBBgrmbl\xAB
    to myself. :^D"
