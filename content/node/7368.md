body: Hey fellow type designers, I&#39;m looking for a favor. Would any of you be
  interested in discussing licensing terms with with me this weekend &#40;via phone
  or e-mail or both&#41;? I&#39;m writing something up, and there are a few things
  that I would how they sound. <BR> <BR>By licensing terms, I don&#39;t mean EULAs,
  I mean licenses between designers and resellers. If anyone is interesting in lending
  me a hand, please contact me off-line.

    of the people on the other side of the equation? <BR> <BR>Si

    the other side of the equation.&#42; Thanks anyway, though.

  body: Dan, are you making a distinction between publishers and resellers? My definition
    of a reseller is a vendor who sells font licences to an end user for typefaces
    that are also available directly from the original designer or publisher and,
    usually, through other resellers. A publisher is a company that exclusively licenses
    a typeface from a design, often involving transfer of copyright, and publishes
    and distributes it as part of its own library, which may or may not involve arrangements
    with resellers. <BR> <BR>The appropriate contract terms, royalty rates, etc. differ
    considerably, depending on whether the designer is dealing with a reseller or
    a publisher.  <BR> <BR>I presume you are also interested only in the retail font
    license market? OEM deals are a whole different ball of wax. <BR> <BR>By the way,
    be sure to contact Jeremy Tankard. I&#39;m a big admirer of the way he conducts
    his business with resellers, and think many of my fellow retail type designers
    can learn some stuff from him.

  body: I don&#39;t want to give too much away here, but I&#39;d like to see how type
    designers react to certain language pertaining to licensing agreements from a
    retailer, who could theoretically be interested in licensing their typefaces for
    retail sale. Many retailers offer an array of licensing agreements to designers,
    ranging from total publishing through reselling. <BR> <BR>In other words, while
    still being vague, I want to run some texts by type designers that pertain to
    a various number of retail licensing options. I&#39;m looking for eager eyes,
    and some minor feedback.
