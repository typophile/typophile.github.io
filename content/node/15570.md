body: "Trying to pack big font nuance into a teenie-tiny footprint\u2014using grays,
  of course. A lot of these characters wouldn't work for me at this size, using traditional
  pixel building techniques.\r\n\r\nThe grays, however, allow me to put together a
  character set that looks more sophisticated than usual. Perhaps not 'book' sophisticated,
  but at least headed in that direction.\r\n\r\nI don't think I used very many grays.
  Either five, or six, I think.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Does the UC Y raise anyone's
  hackles? I was having trouble with it, so I borrowed from the UC J."

  body: Never one to pass up the chance to make things smaller, I've tweaked the original
    set, and gained a 5px verion and a smallcaps version. Plus I tweaked the lc w
    to match the UC W.

  body: "Yah, I guess it does look a lot like Futura. The reality is, I began this
    set from experimenting with the diagonals in the UC M. Then came the rest of the
    set. The thing is, with grays, it's more difficult keep from infringing on other
    pixel designers' work, because a lot of character set variations over the years
    (in the pixel font world) came from the creative ways different designers would
    represent curvature and diagonals.\r\n\r\nThe short of it is, the letters were
    defined by the pixels you left out, as much as they were by the pixels you put
    in.\r\n\r\nNow, everything is different in the grayscape. Building small characters
    actually fills in all of the traditional 'holes' that designers used in the past.
    Further, the 'nuance' of how a designer might use grays, or the patterns of grays,
    to build a character's features, are much more subtle at a glance than before.\r\n\r\nSo,
    the reason this font ended up looking like Futura, was that I had several cool-looking
    characters that I wanted to build a font out of, but wanted to avoid 'aping' other
    designer's character sets. In this particular case, I was really trying to distance
    myself from Susan Kare's work. At this pixel size, her work is really definative.
    There are other designers, like Craig Kroeger, who have some pretty amazing character
    sets too, and I wanted to stay away from all of them the best I could.\r\n\r\nSo,
    I really focused on character widths and the shaping of the tiny curves with different
    grays, all while trying to create a set that had some of the more classic proportions
    found in traditional typography.\r\n\r\nA good example of this kind of classic
    look in a pixel font, in my opinion, is Quadratis, by Miguel Hernandez.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the purpose of such a small font: why, it may be used anywhere stylish typography
    is valued. As accent text on websites; see speakup. As navigation buttons and
    widgets; see slideshow pro. As small titles and subtitles on blog entries; see
    shaun inman. And of course, as small, sophisticated typefaces in hand-held devices
    and cell phones.\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments, H\xE9ctor. I really appreciate
    it.\r\n\r\nTyler"

  body: I have a soft spot for this feeling in type too. In some ways the M feels
    a little overblown but that could be character too. It does seem to stand out
    especially much because it looks like it is more generously spaced than the other
    glyphs. But I like it!

  body: It's amazing. Congradulations. If so I wonder if it might not be a good idea
    to add one more larger size too. I know micro is the reason you made it - but
    think of the enhanced uses! Cheers.

  body: "Yah, I agree that a few larger sizes would be fun to make. Especially the
    one-pixel-wide designs. The larger the point-size and the thinner the pixel font,
    the more unique the style.\r\n\r\nWe all have Mr. Hernandez to thank for that
    design lesson, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThanks for your support guys, I really appreciate
    it.\r\n\r\n-teewhy"
