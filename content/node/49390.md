  I clicked on one of the type tutorial (weathered looking type) and in Safari there
  was no scroll for reading the whole article. I copied the link into Firefox and
  it was fine there.\r\n\r\nStephen Rapp"

  body: Hey Stephen. Please let me know if this crops up again. We definitely want
    the 'Feed to run smoothly on all versions of Safari. Do you remember which link
    you clicked exactly? The headline in the middle column? "Read more"?
