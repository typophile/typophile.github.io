    which, while not as lifestyle-oriented as the goodies above, can double as (1)
    scanner lid weight, (2) stepstool to reach that cookie jar, (3) self defense tool,
    or (4) booster seat.

    being a designer with no real skillset in terms of wine always pick my wine based

    I thought 'hey, that looks like something from Hatch'.\r\n\r\nI picked it up and,
    sure enough, it was...Hatch Show print wine!\r\n\r\nAlas, we didn't grab that

  body: ">why would one need that\r\n\r\nSorry, I guess that was a little too esoteric.
    Orthodox Jews interpret the Biblical prohibition on starting fire on the Sabbath
    as forbidding switching on or off electric lights, as that might involve a spark.
    However it is permitted to leave an electric light on. \r\n\r\nHence one night
    a week you have the problem of reading in bed before sleeping. If you leave a
    light on, then you can't turn it off. But this moveable shade hides the visible
    light without switching the lamp off, and without covering it so it might overheat
    and catch fire.  \r\n\r\nNot being Orthodox, I find it kind of hilarious and sweet
    at the same time. Love that animated gif also. Definitely a 'unique gift item'!"

    don't know anything about sharia, though, so I don't know if it's just another

    Pie Tree</em></a> recently completed by fellow Typophile Jim Rimmer. Here I quote
    from P22:\r\n\r\n<ol>Jim Rimmer has completed: \"Leaves from the Pie Tree\". This
    magnum opus is an autobiographical account of his life with type and the book
    arts along with \"how-to\" knowledge of the craft that a rare few possess. This
    extremely limited edition of 50 copies will include a co-edition of 10 copies
    made for P22 and offered at a discount to the first 6 purchasers of the full Rimmer
    Type Foundry Collection. The size of the book is approx. 10-1/2\" x 14-3/4\".
    Printed in the monotype cast Quill type on 120 GSM Arches Cream text paper on
    a Colts Armory press. The book will be hand bound with a leather and linen quarter
    binding with linocut illustrations, tipped in images and even a hand cut letter
    pattern used in the creation process of his metal type. The book retails for $700(CND)
    and can be ordered directly from Jim Rimmer at the Pie Tree Press ( rimmertype
    {at} shaw {dot} ca ). The p22 co-edition will be available for $400 with the purchase
    of the RTF collection at $999.95. Only a few copies of the P22 co-edition can
    be accommodated.\r\n\r\n$1399.95 with full Rimmer type collection or $650 (US)</ol>\r\n\r\nThere
    are sample images if you follow the link above. It looks to be a tactile and educational
    experience. Long live the printed word!"
