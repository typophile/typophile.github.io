<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
I am really unsure about what symbols to use for apostrophes and quotation marks. Look at:
‘This is a quote.’ and Don’t.
However it soon becomes confusing:
‘She said “Don’t use the same marks for quotation and elisions!” three times.’
This can be solved by using the Unicode specified apostrophe mark ('). However I read on every webpage on the subject that it looks really unprofessional to use don't instead of don’t. I have been suggested to use bold quotation marks. But I mean that looks goofy.
What symbols to use?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The symbols to use for quotoation marks varies with the language, and even with regional preferences. Your example appears to fall in line with UK Engilsh usage, which is the opposite of the USA usage. I'm not sure what you do in Norway.
Are you asking about the straight typewriter style marks as opposed to the curly quote and apostrophe marks one sees in typeset text?
The only time to use bold marks is when the whole of the enclosed text is also set bold.
There is some controversy as to whether to add extra spacing around quotation marks, particularly the singles so as to distinguish them from apostrophes.
I'd go into more detail, but others can speak on this with more authority and I'm too tired, it being near 2 AM here.</div>

<div class=commentbody>These forums have a script that automatically corrects these marks, so nobody will be able to tell quite what you've tried to show us.
The apostrophe is generally the the same as a closing single quotation mark. I hope what ‘she’ said is not what someone actually has been telling you.
The key on your keyboard contains the so-called ‘straight quotes’, inherited from typewriters, that we use informally in computer communications; these should not be used in print except as inch and foot marks.
UK usage prefers single quotes, and then double quotes for quotations nested within them.
USA usage prefers double quotes, and then single quotes for quotations nested within them. It has also become popular to use single quotes for isolated terms of one or two words, e.g. above.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I’m not sure why there’s any confusion about this, or why this is a Typophile thread.
British usage is not “the opposite of USA usage.” Setting aside for a moment the fact that there is more than one usage in the U.K. (e.g., <cite>Monocle</cite> uses British English but double quotation marks at first instance), the differences are wider than that. British orthography places periods and commas inside quotation marks only for direct utterances and outside in other cases. U.S. (also Canadian) usage puts them inside quotation marks always.
There is no distinction in Unicode between an apostrophe and a closing single quotation mark. This is a serious defect, but it will never change. There is also no way to distinguish the usages of neutral opening quote, neutral closing quote, and neutral apostrophe; they’re all one character.
The example in your fifth paragraph isn’t realistic, because the whole sentence would probably not be quoted.
In any event, it is invariant that you alternate double-single or single-double when nesting quotes. The only variable is which one you start off with. British tends to use single; U.S. and Canadian always uses double.
All this is easily Googled or, better, looked up in Fowler’s or Strunk and White or any English-usage book.

<div class=commentbody><dl> <dt>There are two alternatives to nesting quotes, both of which omit them.
The first is to set the quoted matter in its own paragraph, slightly smaller.
The second is to just leave out the quote marks, if that doesn't complicate the meaning of the text.
De Vinne (Correct Composition, 1901) quotes the Bible, without quote marks:<small></dt> <dd>And he came unto his father, and said, My father : and he said, Here am I ; who art thou, my son ?
And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn...</dd></dl></small>
(I would have made that quoted text smaller, but I couldn't get the "small" tag to work.)

<div class=commentbody>There are well more than two alternatives to quotation marks, but having to go back 106 years to find one is a punchline, not an answer. Everyone here knows perfectly well that quotation marks can scarcely ever be avoided and apostrophes even less often (probably never).
The original question did not ask for historical alternatives to quotation marks. This is a person who is not clear on basic usage, not someone who wants the most recherché possible alternative.

<cite>The apostrophe is generally the same as a closing single quotation mark. I hope what ‘she’ said is not what someone actually has been telling you.</cite>
Talking about Unicode, there are quite a few codepoints whose ‘phenotypes’ can look identical. The one bearing the name APOSTROPHE (<a href=http://www.decodeunicode.org/u+0027>U+0027</a>) isn’t one of those. And it isn’t a real apostrophe either.
We got the RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK (<a href=http://www.decodeunicode.org/u+2019>U+2019</a>), which is commonly used for <ul><li>guess what—a right single quotation mark in some languages, English among them</li><li>an elision like don<strong>’</strong>t or <strong>’</strong>07</li></ul>On <a href=http://www.decodeunicode.org/u+02BC>U+02BC</a> we have the MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE. I wonder if that would be the one Joe is missing—and the one that would be appropriate for elisions. Even if it was, the keyboard accessibility of U+02BC doesn’t go well with the frequency of the apostrophe in English language.
Furthermore, there is the COMBINING COMMA ABOVE (<a href=http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+0313>U+0313</a>) and the COMBINING GREEK KORONIS (<a href=http://www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+0343>U+0343</a>), both for combining diacritical marks. They aren’t used in English, however they (can) look like the others and shouldn’t be confused.</div>

All the glyphs in your example are on the right side of a word, and they’re followed by white-space.
Therefore:<ol><li>single right quotation mark (German style—single ones normally for nested quotations, see #4)</li><li>single right quotation mark (English style)</li><li>Comma (You know <em>that</em>, don’t you? Or: Can be used in Italian and Albanian* as single right quotation mark—I question that)</li><li>double right quotation mark (German style—double is standard)</li><li>double left quotation mark (German style—wrong placement! Or: Can be used in Italian and Albanian* as double right quotation mark.)</li><li>single prime (<a href=http://www.decodeunicode.org/u+2032>U+2032</a> or <a href=http://www.decodeunicode.org/u+0027>U+0027</a> (to denote minutes, foot etc.—wrong placement!)</li><li>double prime (to denote seconds, inch etc.—wrong placement!)</li></ol>
Of course, there are a lot of other interpretations and possible combinations, depending on the context. Correct me if there’s sth. wrong.

No, according to <a href=http://www.alvestrand.no/pipermail/ietf-languages/2006-June/004742.html>Karl Ove Hufthammer</a> it isn’t.
<cite>Letter Apostrophe.
U+02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE is preferred where the apostrophe is to represent a modifier letter (for example, in transliterations to indicate a glottal stop). In the latter case, it is also referred to as a letter apostrophe.</cite>
<cite>Punctuation Apostrophe.
U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK is preferred where the character is to represent a punctuation mark, as for contractions: “We’ve been here before.” In this latter case, U+2019 is also referred to as a punctuation apostrophe.</cite>

<div class=commentbody>> Canadian always uses double
Not really. University of Toronto Press, at least, has long used the single quote first. The reason is it provides better typographic colour to the page. A lot of double quote marks look like some insect has crapped all over the page. The single marks are less obtrusive, and make the reading flow easier to process.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I note that you are from Norway, which uses "guillemets" as the standard quote marks, if I am not mistaken.
Perhaps this is colouring your perception?
In the English-speaking countries, people are habituated to the ambiguity of the apostrophe/right quote, and more attuned to solving it through the contextual meaning of words.</div>

<div class=commentbody>To Florian: thanks so much (I used the glyph on the right side just to keep in mind the right proportion with the other glyphs). The tirdh glyph is not a comma but the single right quotation mark (i used FF Absara TF Bold SC by Xavier Dupré). So, what's the right placement for glyph 6 and 7? And, above all, what's the difference in using single quotes instead of double quotes? For me, single quoting get the text an ancient effect. Am I wrong?
P.S. I write from Italy and we use double quotes and guillemots to regularly quote text. Personally, I don't use single quotes because of ambiguity with lots of italian words that need apostrophes as in <em>l'"identità visuale"</em> or <em>dell'"incommensurabilità"</em>.</div>

Sometimes you have a text with nested quotes (a quote within a quote, see Aleksandersen’s original post). Then you may want to use both to make it clear. Which one where? That’s language (and region) specific, as others pointed out before.
<em>Detailtypografie</em> (see above) says that this is how Italians do it:
<strong>«&#8201;citazione&#8201;» / «‹&#8201;citazione&#8201;› annidata in citazione&#8201;»</strong> (with some extra whitespace, French style)
or alternatively
<strong>“&#8201;citazione&#8201;„ / “‘&#8201;citazione&#8201;, annidata in citazione&#8201;„</strong>
Especially the latter rings hollow … Maybe <em>you</em> can confirm/disprove?</div>
