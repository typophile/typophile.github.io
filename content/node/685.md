  body: '&#62;Nick, do you mean that you had suggested that students should or should
    not be able to open up the fonts on the server, and for whichever reason: why?
    <BR> <BR>Yes, if the fonts are on the server, I wanted students to be able to
    open them up in Fontographer &#40;and it was made possible by the tech staff&#41;.
    For instance, a study of the sidebearings in Futura, how they differ for vertical
    stems, curves, and diagonals, is very instructive of the whole principle of  font
    letterspacing, and most obvious in Futura, because of its very geometric from.
    <BR> <BR>&#62;what would be the minimum level of qualification and experience
    for a person to tutor design students on typography? <BR> <BR>That&#39;s too complicated
    to answer here. '

  body: '&#62;Adobe has been pretty responsive to employees saying, &#34;I can see
    how that would make business sense, but I believe it would be unethical and violate
    our company&#39;s core values. <BR> <BR>I do appreciate what Adobe has done, such
    as creating PostScript and making my career as a type designer possible! And in
    my experience it&#39;s a class act right down the line. <BR> <BR>However, because
    Adobe is such a dominant player, and its foundry is a minor part of its business,
    even small things it does in the font market can create waves, which others can
    ride, or get washed out. It&#39;s rarely immediately apparent what&#39;s for the
    greater good, which is open to discussion anyway. <BR> <BR>Dumping is a real problem
    &#40;and of course others do it, eg Bitstream Odyssey, which I participate in,
    thank you very much.&#41; <BR> <BR>When a company gives away &#40;or sells at
    very low cost&#41; large quantities of old, cheap, or &#34;non per-unit&#34; royalty
    fonts, that has a negative effect on the market, especially for its competitors.
    <BR> <BR>Let me give you three examples. <BR> <BR>1. In the early &#39;90s, Adobe
    bundled a collection of faces &#40;many ITC&#41; on Illustrator CDs. This really
    poisoned the font market, not to mention type culture. <BR> <BR>2. Many times,
    I have had publication designers say to me &#34;Nick, such-and-such client doesn&#39;t
    want to buy your fonts, which I have used in my comp, because they already have
    the Adobe library.&#34; This is particularly galling for us, because Adobe has
    few good new news head faces &#40;their stuff is strongest for corporate, advertising,
    and book work&#41;. <BR> <BR>3. &#34;Type Classics for Learning&#34; is not a
    good proposition for educational culture. In the first place, because the fonts
    are &#34;non-per-unit royalty&#34;, they are not the best Adobe has to offer.
    I haven&#39;t seen the list, but I would imagine most of them are somewhat out-of-date,
    and not yet back in fashion: is that really the stuff to give students to work
    with? <BR> <BR>Secondly, with so many fonts, schools, universities and colleges
    will be inclined to think that they&#39;ve covered the bases. Nothing could be
    further from the truth. Adobe&#39;s fonts are great, but they are conservative
    and mainstream. Surely students should work with fonts that cover the gamut of
    foundries &#40;as I posted earlier in this thread&#41;. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s
    on Classics for Learning, but I can tell you that on Type Odyssey 2 there is not
    a single pixel font. <BR> <BR>Educators should be encouraged to provide students
    with a full spectrum of fonts, and Classics for Learning discourages this. <BR>
    <BR>I propose that the type industry as a whole should put together a &#34;suitable
    for education&#34; package&#40;s&#41;, containing the work of many foundries.
    Perhaps this would be a thankless bureaucratic task, but it would be better in
    the long run. <BR> <BR>Or how about &#34;Indie Fonts for Education&#34;? <BR>

    well with American Capitalism. We&#39;re all about selling the most product at
    the cheapest price with the most profit margin.  <BR> <BR>I completely understand
    everything you are saying, but what can you do? You can make a stink, but that&#39;s
    really not going to change anything anyone does, unfortunately.  <BR> <BR>Your
    three examples are all justifiable complaints coming from an independant type
    designer, but they&#39;re equally justifiable realities &#40;and maybe even benefits&#41;
    for the graphic designers/clients.  <BR> <BR>Remember, most people don&#39;t want
    &#39;the best&#39;...they want &#39;the most affordable&#39;. Sad, but true. <BR>
    <BR>My personal view, as a graphic designer, would be to embrace the &#39;don&#39;t
    pay until you use it for a real job&#39; idea. Nearly impossible to police, but
    I like the concept. It would allow a designer to use many more typefaces for client
    presentations. It would, in theory, allow an obscure, independant typeface to
    end up on a client&#39;s list of picks and lead to a license of said font. Something
    that may not have happened if the firm would have had to purchase the face up
    front. I&#39;m sure there are a lot of problems with the concept as well, though.'

    a public company. If I were to single out the worst thing in Capitalism, it would
    be that increasingly people who have no sensibility towards and interest in the

    is the end goal, that&#39;s unavoidable. So Darrel, you&#39;re right: there can&#39;t

  body: 'Anonymous - <BR> <BR>Thanks for your insights. <BR> <BR>From my point of
    view as someone who comes from an art direction / graphic design background, from
    all the way back in the days when type was &#39;comped&#39; by hand with a variety
    of Magic Markers or sometimes even gouache with a real paint brush, I have a different
    view. <BR> <BR>There are today countless online type sampler interfaces, for getting
    monitor-resolution samples of your text, just as you&#39;d like it. Or close enough
    for a &#39;comp&#39; for presentation to sell the job. <BR> <BR>Plus, we &#40;and
    I&#39;d bet most or all other foundries&#41; gladly set samples and provide .JPGs
    when asked. <BR> <BR>In our case, we even provide FreeHand/Illustrator files with
    the outline characters, for a small fee, if someone needs a high resolution file.
    <BR> <BR>So my opinion as someone who has been in art direction for 30 years,
    and offers the above to great reception to people in need who then quickly become
    customers, is that you&#39;re being creatively lazy. <BR> <BR>And going out of
    your way to justify software piracy &#40;which is criminal by definition&#41;
    to prop up your own laziness. <BR> <BR>At the comping stage of a job, having the
    actual typeface in your font menu and doing a presentation layout &#40;a &#39;comp&#39;,
    or &#39;comprehensive&#39; layout&#41; using the real type &#40;or a clone&#41;
    doesn&#39;t make your work any more creative or acceptance to clients.  <BR> <BR>Clients
    don&#39;t care about anything except whether the creative development is attuned
    to the marketing strategy. <BR> <BR>So the idea of using real type at that stage
    might seem necessary, but it&#39;s not. <BR> <BR>If a concept has a need to set
    lots and lots of type &#40;such as for a repeating or endless looking background&#41;,
    budget to buy a suitable type. Or use an OS font and fog it a little to get through
    the presentation stage.  <BR> <BR>Be sure you have adequate money allocated in
    your design budget for buying the type you will need to accomplish your project
    professionally. <BR> <BR>Your client wants &#39;the best&#39;. Your client will
    not know what you as designer need to achieve &#39;the best&#39; unless you tell
    them. And back it up with a professionally delineated quotation for advance signature
    to proceed. <BR> <BR>If a font isn&#39;t available on an online type sampler,
    such as ours at  <BR><a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html" target="_blank">http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html</a>
    <BR>not available for rental &#40;a rarity&#41;, or &#39;on approval&#39; &#40;equally
    rare&#41;, and you can&#39;t get a foundry to talk to you and provide a sample,
    I can tell you here&#39;s the absolute next best thing: <BR> <BR>Go to Staples
    or OfficeMax, etc., and buy a box of 12 Pilot Razor Point pens. Get some regular
    typing paper. Get a ruler and with a light pencil draw two or three parallel lines
    for each line you need to draw. Have a t-square and drawing board? Great, you&#39;re
    in business. <BR> <BR>&#40;Of course, if you have a drawing tablet like a Wacom,
    and are adept at electronic brush and cut and paste, that&#39;s great, too. Is
    it better? Depends on your skills.&#41; <BR> <BR>Then, sketch the type you hope
    to use in your concept. Scan your sketch and add that to your layout. <BR> <BR>In
    this era of scanners, since the inspiration to use a certain typeface is likely
    some printed piece you&#39;ve seen, scan the type from that. Go to the foundry&#39;s
    web site and look at the missing characters. Sketch them and add them to your
    scan. <BR> <BR>While this might seem tedious reading, it&#39;s the kind of thing
    that actually takes less time to do than talking or writing about it. <BR> <BR>And
    you know what? Sketching it is actually more satisfying than sneaking around collecting
    fonts surreptitiously. <BR> <BR>Plus, it puts the emphasis back on open-ended
    creativeness. Not simply forcing you to choose from what you have on your pirate
    CD, can get from a complicitious friend or colleague, etc. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve written
    this this way because you sound like you might be an art director or graphic designer.
    If you&#39;re not, here&#39;s your chance to work like a design professional:
    Professionally. <BR> <BR>This is about your career, and the difference between
    bringing crime into the workplace, or doing your job in the most creative way.

    the point. You need to appeal to the laziness of the consumer. ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;So
    the idea of using real type at that stage might seem necessary, but it&#39;s not.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Again, if the type isn&#39;t important at that stage, then it&#39;s not
    important at any stage in the client&#39;s eyes. I have to completely agree with
    the client&#39;s stance that &#39;I have Helvetica and Times, let&#39;s use that
    for our ID system&#39; argument. Saying &#34;well, I really think you should consider
    licensing this typeface across your company&#34; AFTER the client has approved
    the concept isn&#39;t going to be a very compelling argument. <BR> <BR>&#34;Your
    client wants &#39;the best&#39;. Your client will not know what you as designer
    need to achieve &#39;the best&#39; unless you tell them. And back it up with a
    professionally delineated quotation for advance signature to proceed.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>No. Clients, like most consumers, do not want the best. They want the most
    affordable/convenient. That&#39;s a reality of the American Consumer. <BR> <BR>Both
    the designer and client tend to think &#39;yea, the extra $200 for the nicer typeface
    would be nice, but Arial Black is good enough.&#39; <BR> <BR>&#34;Sketching it
    is actually more satisfying than sneaking around collecting fonts surreptitiously.
    &#34; <BR> <BR>But it really takes a bite out of your billable hours. ;o&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Finally, Joe, I completely agree that font piracy is bad, illegal, and
    not a good thing for the industry. But do realize that preachin&#39; that is a
    waste of breath &#40;er...finger stamina&#41; as those that pirate know that they
    are doing it and you&#39;re not going to change their mind ;o&#41;'

  body: 'Joe, <BR> <BR>Thanks for your response, and your contribution. <BR>First,
    I should clear up a misunderstanding &#40;I wasn&#39;t clear enough in my previous
    post&#41;. I&#39;m not talking about using pirate fonts for getting through a
    presentation to a client to get a job - if the font is suitable enough to be included
    in my presentation to a client, then I&#39;m prepared to pay for it. <BR>I use
    pirate fonts to experiment with on my own machine, at the stage where ideas are
    being tried just to see how far they go. <BR>&#40;In many cases, my work is not
    static or printed work, so magic markers are not going to get me far even at this
    stage&#41;. <BR> <BR>You say that I&#39;m being &#39;creatively lazy&#39; and
    &#39;going out of your way to justify software piracy &#40;which is criminal by
    definition&#41; to prop up your own laziness&#39; <BR> <BR>OK, well I don&#39;t
    justify software piracy, I just live in the real world. <BR>I work the way which
    is most efficent for me to work. Laziness doesn&#39;t enter into it &#40;You could
    equally call yourself too lazy to protect your fonts properly - it would also
    be neither helpful nor true&#41;. <BR>I&#39;m sure your font creation skills are
    as professional as you claim, but its the 21st century now and you need to bring
    your software distribution skills up to a professional level too. <BR>All I&#39;m
    doing is offering you an insight into how some people work so that you might start
    to think creatively about how to sell more fonts through improved customer service
    initiatives. <BR>If you shy away from this kind of approach because you fear being
    ripped off by pirates, then, in my opinion, you&#39;ll lose many potential sales,
    and you&#39;ll still be ripped off by pirates. <BR> <BR>Try something like this:
    <BR>I send you reciepts for fonts I&#39;ve purchased over the last year - so you
    know that I am the kind of person who buys fonts, not a pirate. <BR>Next you make
    your fonts available for me to download. From then, every time I start playing
    around with ideas for a new job, your fonts are included in the pool of fonts
    I&#39;m using in this experimental stage. The chances of me using one of your
    fonts increases dramatically. <BR> <BR>Maybe independent foundries could get together
    to agree a set of shared criteria which would qualify someone for &#39;trusted
    font user&#39; status. <BR> <BR>You have to accept that pirates will rip off your
    work - this happens in almost all indutries and there&#39;s not much you can do
    about it. <BR>You also have to accept that this won&#39;t be any worse if you
    adopt a generally trusting attitude than if you adopt a generally mistrusful one.

    like this, or I won&#39;t pay you&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Regardless of how surly some
    clients might be, they will generally respect you for knowing how to act like

    <BR> <BR> <BR>Anonymous, honestly, I appreciate your thoughtful, detailed post.
    <BR> <BR>I believe you are being forthright in offering such receipts.  <BR> <BR>However,
    receipts can be fabricated. And you&#39;re starting the discussion from anonymity.
    Would such supplied receipts have all contact information blacked out? <BR> <BR>The
    foundries you are ripping off have in many cases, spent thousands of dollars to
    produce &#39;try before you buy&#39; type sampler environments online. Sometimes
    tens of thousands, in design, programming and maintenance. Not to mention the
    ongoing costs associated with keeping it available as close to 24/7/365 as possible.
    <BR> <BR>That is, indeed, bringing type marketing into the 21st century. <BR>
    <BR>And it does, coupled with the other &#39;reaching out&#39; services I mentioned
    above, constitute quite a lot of support to the type using community. <BR> <BR>Plus
    you always have the opportunity to easily scan characters out of catalogs and
    assembling headlines for ads, etc. It&#39;s not that hard. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;If
    you shy away from this kind of approach  <BR>&#62;because you fear being ripped
    off by pirates, <BR>&#62;then, in my opinion, you&#39;ll lose many  <BR>&#62;potential
    sales, and you&#39;ll still be  <BR>&#62;ripped off by pirates. <BR> <BR> <BR>I
    would counter with this:  <BR> <BR>If you want to believe that it is appropriate
    to rip off the intellectual property of others, when the law says that pirating
    software property is a criminal act, then you will lead yourself into criminal
    behavior. <BR> <BR>It will be a personal decision and a career decision that you

    there&#39;s nothing anyone can do to stop a personal decision like that, until
    you&#39;re ultimately stopped in a very public way, by enforcement. <BR> <BR>
    <BR> <BR>&#62; Maybe independent foundries could  <BR>&#62;get together to agree
    a set of  <BR>&#62;shared criteria which would qualify <BR>&#62;someone for &#39;trusted
    font user&#39; status. <BR> <BR> <BR>In marketing, such criteria already exists.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s called becoming a &#39;paying customer&#39;, and then going
    on to becoming a &#39;repeat customer&#39;. <BR> <BR>Believe me, paying customers
    who become repeat customers get catered to. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Using a forum like

    sincerely, thanks again for your considered thoughts. <BR> <BR>Please step back
    from your activities and consider the widespread &#39;reaching out&#39; that foundries
    are already doing. <BR> <BR>For &#42;&#42;your&#42;&#42; benefit. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    &#34;one-off&#34; EPS settings of their fonts &#40;taking the lead from URW&#43;&#43;&#41;.
    But of course that doesn&#39;t work for running text. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>I once
    worked out a system in my head where each font file sold would have a unique serial
    number, and ATM or the OS would periodically check the numbers &#40;using the
    internet&#41; against a dynamically-and-remotely-updated central database that
    contains all valid serial numbers. If the font doesn&#39;t check out &#40;either
    because the serial number isn&#39;t coming from where it&#39;s supposed to, or
    because the serial number fails parity check&#41;, it doesn&#39;t render, and
    you might get a little pop-up alerting you to the &#34;problem&#34; &#40;or worse&#41;...
    The database would have to be maintained by an impartial and confidentiality-restricted
    third party to which font foundries submit all the serial numbers of sold fonts,
    maybe for a reasonable fee. There are some more details in my head &#40;like who

    are not precise enough, and  <BR>&#62;substitute faces become approved faces.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>Well, as a graphic designer or art director, you and your creative
    director have to make the conscious decision to be leaders, or to be led around.
    <BR> <BR>Isn&#39;t that taught anymore? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;I assume you haven&#39;t
    worked in  <BR>&#62;real world graphic design for some time. <BR> <BR> <BR>Actually,
    I continue to do it. There are several such projects in here right now. &#40;I
    have great, reciprocal relationships with my clients. They think so, too.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>True reciprocity is a key. <BR> <BR>If you thought &#40;let&#39;s say,
    hypothetically&#41; that you were in a design situation/environment/deadline/budget
    where your creativity was being crimped, don&#39;t you think your executive art
    director, creative director or other team leader would want to hear about it?
    <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;It&#39;s amazing. And it takes a lot of coercion  <BR>&#62;to
    make the client see just how important <BR>&#62;typography is as a tool for his
    brand or company.  <BR> <BR>It can sometimes. You really make your own reality.
    <BR>Congratulations on starting the process! <BR> <BR>:-&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>I
    have to say that throughout my entire design career, unless I was put into a situation
    to art direct under a pre-defined corporate ID guide, I &#40;and when I had a
    creative director then they and I&#41; chose to lead. Not to follow. <BR> <BR>You
    have to want to do it. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;&#40;...&#41;sketching out the
    body type &#40;or the headlines, for that matter&#41; isn&#39;t going to fly&#40;...&#41;
    <BR> <BR> <BR>I&#39;m talking about headlines and subheads. For body, use anything
    that&#39;s of an appropriately similar width, to something you might use as the
    final. <BR> <BR>&#40;Or, our TF Squiggle greeking makes a good substitute.&#41;
    <BR> <BR> <BR>One of advertising and design&#39;s biggest problems is the emphasis
    on getting the rough layout to look like a final, too early on.  <BR> <BR>&#40;As
    wonderful as electronic publishing is, this has been a problem since about 1985
    and the first LaserWriter. And earlier, as early as 1982, with proprietary electronic
    comping systems such as the Lightspeed.&#41; <BR> <BR>Again, this is about putting
    the emphasis back on the creative&#39;s attuning to the strategy. <BR> <BR> <BR>
    <BR>The only kind of text setting where a tighter look might require the actual
    type is in a dictated corporate ID situation &#40;where the type would most likely
    be on hand&#41; or for ads or brochures requiring display-sized text. Where the
    text is so large, it becomes tremendously important to the texture of the presentation.
    <BR> <BR>Plus, what&#39;s wrong with dummying the text, and in asociation with
    the layout, handing the client a manuscript sheet? <BR> <BR>Nothing at all, in
    my experience. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;1&#41; He&#39;s not ripping off anybody
    because he wouldn&#39;t have paid for the stuff otherwise anyway.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Is
    he using it? He says so. <BR> <BR>Does he recognize it&#39;s pirated? He says
    so. <BR> <BR> <BR>Is it ok to rip others off, because you yourself &#40;speaking
    generally now&#41; can&#39;t figure out how to avoid your creative latitude being
    put-upon? <BR> <BR>What kind of rationale for creativity is that? <BR> <BR> <BR>
    <BR>&#62;&#62; The foundries you are ripping off have in many cases, spent thousands
    of dollars&#40;...&#41; <BR> <BR>2&#41; You can only blame them for wasting money.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>Now that really is one of the more ignorant things I&#39;ve heard
    here, to-date. <BR> <BR>Listmum: Can an &#39;ignorant comment meter&#39; be programmed
    for use here?  <BR>I think we&#39;ve just seen the high end defined. <BR> <BR>
    <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;Or it could be viewed as a way to  <BR>&#62;improve things
    by being candid to people  <BR>&#62;who have trouble seeing reality and  <BR>&#62;being
    pragmatic about it. <BR> <BR> <BR>That&#39;s okay.  <BR> <BR>See, I know you&#39;ll
    snap out of it eventually. <BR> <BR>Once the special interest groups stop paying
    you to foist your agenda on an otherwise right-minded list. &#40;I can launch
    conspiracy theories, too.&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;If someone could create

    <BR> <BR>&#62;Did you miss the part about having  <BR>&#62;to get MS/Adobe on
    board&#40;...&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Nope.  <BR> <BR>Hrant, I&#39;ve been over all
    this years ago; the idea that nothing like this could be actuated without the
    OS and PostScript language and primary layout software players signing on early.
    <BR> <BR>Getting the code written, tested and to retail is not my cup of tea,
    but it could be yours. <BR> <BR>Say there are 50 foundries out there that might
    each pay you $2000 per year to rent it &#40;if you went that way&#41;. Would that
    cover your developmental costs? <BR> <BR>Well, of course, you might not know until
    you costed it all out. <BR> <BR>All I&#39;m saying is, don&#39;t give up on your
    idea, because it might be a good thing for you.  <BR> <BR>Especially if you believe
    in your plan &#40;and even though the plan might face modification throughout
    the process&#41;. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Darrel, <BR> <BR>&#62;I understand your POV,
    but be careful  <BR>&#62;in calling your potential customers  <BR>&#62;&#39;babies&#39;,
    &#39;criminals&#39;, &#39;lazy&#39;, etc. <BR> <BR> <BR>Believe me, I don&#39;t
    use words like that, willy-nilly. <BR> <BR>Historically, during the entire time
    that Treacyfaces has been in business &#40;since 1984&#41;, I don&#39;t find that
    designers who are actually prone to becoming our customers &#40;they usually exist
    at the high end&#41; are &#39;babies&#39;, &#39;criminals&#39;, &#39;lazy&#39;,
    at all. <BR> <BR>I think the designers that are &#39;babies&#39;, &#39;criminals&#39;,
    &#39;lazy&#39; will know who they are.  <BR> <BR>They&#39;re the ones pirating
    in the dark, compromising their self-worth personally and professionally. <BR>
    <BR> <BR><blink><b>Codger Alert!</b></blink> <BR> <BR>As I mentioned earlier,
    when I started in design &#40;1973&#41;, I had far fewer tools. No electronic
    tools. But at least we had Magic Markers, gouache, Letraset and other transfer
    lettering. <BR> <BR>And we had Headliners, and Photo-Lettering printed specimen
    books, and local type shop specimen books, for instance.  <BR> <BR>When we focused
    on using a particular typeface, and if it wasn&#39;t available in transfer lettering,
    we drew it.  <BR> <BR>&#40;Later, after approval, we ordered the actual type.  <BR>
    <BR>Things are so much easier today, with scanners, online type samplers, etc.  <BR>
    <BR>And yet, there&#39;s this predisposition to make up all these candy&#42;&#42;&#42;
    excuses to invoke &#39;right to pirate&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Listen, in the 1980s, I
    was an art director who comped the stuff by hand, and then after approval, had
    final text and display flown in by Fedex overnight and through customs - all the
    way to Philadelphia at the time - from Typsettra in Toronto on many occasions.
    <BR> <BR>For comped text, I statted text from text specimens. For display, I drew
    it with marker.&#41; <BR> <BR>Gee, I sure wish I had then, services like the type
    samplers - such as ours - available today. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not so hard. I&#39;m
    talking about tight sketches that are tight enough to look credible, not final
    typeface art. <BR> <BR>Done right, it works exceptionally well. <BR> <BR>Between
    my earlier post and this one, I noticed a car commercial &#40;Kia?&#41; running
    on the US ABC TV national feed, that seemed to use smallish, seemingly handlettered
    call-outs that kind of looked like a lettered Stymie Extra Bold, or somesuch.
    In general, it&#39;s that kind of roughness that I&#39;m referring to that we&#39;ve
    used effectively for years, for heads and subheads. <BR> <BR>But really, with
    all the specimen books out there &#40;the FontShop FontBook, Precision Type&#39;s
    compendium, Font Bureau&#39;s catalogs, Treacyfaces/Headliners catalogs, all notwithstanding&#41;,
    and scanners to be had for $100., there&#39;s no excuse. <BR> <BR>If scanners
    were still $2500., like our first one was in 1988, I could understand the whining.
    <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Hrant said, <BR> <BR>&#62; I don&#39;t think Joe realizes&#40;...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Really, I&#39;ve been over all of this before, for years. <BR> <BR> <BR>
    <BR>&#62;Actually, if something is hard enough to crack &#40;...&#41; <BR> <BR>
    <BR>That&#39;s the easy part, encrypting something so that&#39;s undefeatable.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s getting it to work at the level fonts reside within the food
    chain inside the computer, that would be toughest. <BR> <BR>Which is the real
    reason why it&#39;s been shied away from, with the decade of OS changes we&#39;ve
    just been through. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;The guerilla of my dreams! <BR>
    <BR>We like the same puns!? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;How about a different
    approach.  <BR>&#62;I head down to my local print shop, <BR>&#62;get a pile of
    letterheads printed <BR>&#62;with &#39;FEDERATION AGAINST SOFTWARE THEFT&#39;  <BR>&#62;on
    them and send out a few 1000 letters  <BR>&#62;informing design and ad agencies
    of  <BR>&#62;an offical software inspection,  <BR>&#62;where proof of purchase
    for all software  <BR>&#62;including fonts must be provided.... <BR> <BR> <BR>Well,
    I don&#39;t think anyone, including the font software makers that are members
    of FAST, especially like such a scenario. <BR> <BR>But in all seriousness, it
    could be fast approaching. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;I would be excited about
    opportunity  <BR>&#62;to try out those fonts I seem to like,  <BR>&#62;but can&#39;t
    afford to buy for trial. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to figure that one out, too. <BR>
    <BR>Actually both those issues. We need to get more of our fonts converted, too.
    <BR> <BR>There are real disadvantages for some markets, regarding range and cost.
    <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;A lot of the well-intentioned  <BR>&#62;copyright protection
    schemes suggested  <BR>&#62;here would put companies in the <BR>&#62;position
    of treating their customers  <BR>&#62;and potential customers like criminals.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know; it seems to me that if done properly, it would
    have all the alarm of a splash screen. <BR> <BR>That is to say, as long as the

    <BR>But:  <BR>1&#41; The method I&#39;m describing prevents duplicate serial numbers.  <BR>2&#41;
    You can&#39;t crack a font because it&#39;s not an executable - it needs a renderer,
    like ATM. Sure, you could crack ATM to stop it from doing the remote checking
    I described, but that wouldn&#39;t be easy. And cracking on OS is harder.  <BR>
    <BR>&#62; I honestly can&#39;t see why Adobe is considering it  <BR> <BR>Just
    to be clear:  <BR>1&#41; What I outlined isn&#39;t something I got from Adobe.  <BR>2&#41;
    I do think Adobe did consider such ideas in private, but decided against them.  <BR>
    <BR>hhp&#34; <BR> <BR>One of Quark&#39;s anti piracy things is duplicate serial
    numbers.  Quark 6 has a serial number tied directly to the computer you install
    it on and you can&#39;t install it on another computer because it needs authorisation
    from Quark before it will start. <BR> <BR>You can crack anything...all you have
    to do is go into a font and just start changing the serial number.  Or, if that
    doesn&#39;t work, like you said apply a crack to ATM or the OS.  And regardless
    of how hard it would be, someone would do it.  Most likely it would be cracked
    by a legitimate user who doesn&#39;t want to have big brother watching over his
    shoulder. <BR> <BR>And I know you didn&#39;t get the idea from Adobe, but Adobe
    is considering something along those lines for their future releases.  Already
    in Australia, Photoshop 7 requires activation before it can be used. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    ridiculous, and in the long run I&#39;m willing to bet that the costs of security
    development add more to the cost of the software than piracy does.'

  body: '&#62;Codger Alert! <BR> <BR>Sorry Joe, ignore last rude comment. I&#39;ve
    now had time to read your post. <BR> <BR>Nice try with the suggestion for hand-drawing
    comps. <BR> <BR>My experience drawing comps matches your own. I still do the occasional
    comp by hand -- but only for stuff that will require custom lettering to finish
    it. <BR> <BR>The problem with rough comps versus &#34;finished&#34; is that the
    expectation of most people -- clients and art directors/designers -- is that you
    use one extreme or the other.  <BR> <BR>So, if you&#39;re going slick, you combine
    a photographic image &#40;most likely a thumbnail from an online royalty-free
    stock agency&#41;, with typesetting in an appropriate font -- if not the one ultimately
    desired. The danger here is that if the client likes the comp,  the finished piece
    ends up using the royalty free stock image rather than commissioned original work,
    and the same font as in the comp. <BR> <BR>Alternatively, if you&#39;re going
    high-concept, the comp can be really simple, a &#34;cartoon&#34; in fact, in which
    case the choice of typeface also is not crucial. <BR>And one of the reasons for
    this is that comp rendering skills are a dying art. At school, it&#39;s tough
    to get students to do thumbnail comps, i.e. to think with a pencil. They prefer
    to think with a mouse. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t like to be so negative, but the old
    way of doing comps is unlikely to make a comeback. Art Directors just don&#39;t  do
    things by hand, the sensibility no longer exists -- look at those finished headlines
    you see in ads, set in a &#34;handwriting&#34; font, where no-one is bothered
    that, say, two adjacent letters are identical. It would be so easy to write the
    headline by hand, scan it, and drop it in. <BR> <BR>'

    pay for it. I have NO moral problem with this. <BR>2. When I buy a font, I&#39;m
    buying 2 things, the actual physical font file, and the right to use someone else&#39;s
    intellectual and creative effort &#40;the embedded creativity, if you like&#41;.
    <BR>You say that I shouldn&#39;t use either of these &#40;even for experimental
    purposes&#41; without having bought the font. Yet you think it would be OK to
    scan in the letters from a specimen book and use those scans. <BR>Would that not,

    about getting a rough to fairly tight looking advertising comp layout completed.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;The idea was that if the layout gets approved for finishing, then
    the actual font fileset gets purchased and everything gets finished through normal
    high resolution methods.&#41; <BR> <BR>Criminality aside for a moment, I was asking
    all the Netherlands-based commercial foundry types who hang out here, which of
    the three scenarios they&#39;d prefer. <BR> <BR>With the goal being the stemming
    piracy, while providing customers something they can use. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re already
    in an era of &#39;soft proofing&#39;. <BR> <BR>According to all the experts who
    survey the graphic arts, soft proofing &#40;foregoing &#39;contract proofs&#39;
    like Matchprints, Cromalins, etc.&#41; is increasing. <BR> <BR>&#40;I myself find
    onscreen-only, or onscreen-primarily proofing unappealing, because I like prefer
    proofs like Matchprint II and Cromalin. But this is the trend, we&#39;re told;
    customer-driven.&#41; <BR> <BR>That quickening progression &#40;happening largely
    because of the acceptance of PDF&#41; is another reason why &#39;soft proofs&#39;
    from an online typesampler for comp presentation layouts, is perfectly fine. <BR>
    <BR>So where could possible problems come to light? <BR> <BR>Well, if there&#39;s
    an area in a layout presented as PDF, where a customer has to be able to zoom
    in, then take the onscreen typesampler sample, resample it at 200-ppi or 300-ppi,
    sharpen it a little if necessary, and it&#39;s perfectly fine to present and be
    able to zoom into. <BR> <BR>If a customer doesn&#39;t need to zoom in, then, in
    Acrobat, lock the view size. <BR> <BR>Then, they won&#39;t be aware of the lower
    resolution of the type from an online typesampler &#40;which, if antialiased well,
    isn&#39;t bad at all&#41;. <BR> <BR>Again, this is easy stuff that takes less
    time to do than it does to write about it. <BR> <BR>More good reasons why it&#39;s
    easy to avoid participating in font piracy. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I&#39;m still interested
    in the opinions of the Netherlands-based commercial foundry types who hang out
    here, if they care to comment. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR>

    of places in the software industry where non-traditional buying schemes are being

    <BR> <BR>- Receipts can be forged; <BR> <BR>- A large segment of the user community
    [if the assertion is true that &#40;I&#39;m generalizing here&#41; most graphic
    designers out there working do actively pirate fonts] isn&#39;t really showing
    the type foundries that it can be trusted. <BR> <BR>Granted, maybe there&#39;s
    a methodology where it could work. <BR> <BR>The number of suggestions on this
    list nudging the idea that piracy is ok, similar to the argument in music where
    &#39;the record companies just don&#39;t give us what we want, so, by God, we&#39;re
    going to disregard the laws that society has determined, and take that music anyway&#39;,
    makes me uncomfortable. <BR> <BR>I had no idea that pop culture music was so much
    like food and water that a person couldn&#39;t live without it for even one hour.
    To where they actually have to steal it. And pack iPods that hold as much as 7,500
    songs. It&#39;s a fascinating commentary on humanity, really. <BR> <BR>Quite honestly,
    I still hold the view that the terms under which the property can be acquired,
    used and disposed of, lie with the property owner if that&#39;s covered by law.  <BR>
    <BR>In the case of software fonts, of course, it is. <BR> <BR>If a user &#40;who
    doesn&#39;t want to abide by the property owner&#39;s rules&#41;, then they should
    stop everything they&#39;re doing, learn how to make their own original creation

    ability to execute to strategy is what will cause a client or prospect to like
    or dislike a concept &#40;presented in the form of a comprehensive layout&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Nothing more. Nothing less. <BR> <BR>Everything else is window dressing,
    and the more that creative teams tend to the window dressing and not the core
    client issues, the more unsuccessful they will be.  <BR> <BR>And actually, the
    more dilute their creative will be. <BR> <BR>If the creative person excuses away
    their inability to deal with core client needs, by inviting software piracy into
    their career, that&#39;s a mistake. <BR> <BR>Clarity of type in a layout is not
    what sells the layout. It has never been that way, and it never will be. Online
    sampler type and other methods I&#39;ve discussed above provide good results;
    fine for layout presentation. <BR> <BR>The exception, of course, are layouts that
    use display typography prominently. And in that case, the responsible creative
    person discusses that with their superiors and with the client, and gets a budget
    defined to encompass their exploratory and finished art needs.  <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;
    can you put your discomfort aside  <BR>&#62;enough to work with reality&#40;...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t expect you to understand any of this, Hrant.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t expect you to understand that business requires that one
    puts aside discomfort every day, to attend to business. <BR> <BR>Nor do I expect
    you to grasp the rather minimal needs of rough layouts and objective and strategy
    foundation. <BR> <BR>Likewise, I also don&#39;t expect you to understand the whole
    soft proofing discussion above. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;&#40;...&#41;to work with reality,
    not against it&#40;...&#41; <BR> <BR>I believe that we and other typefoundries
    that proactively spend to offer literature and specimens and an online typesampler
    are indeed meeting the reality of legitimate customer need. <BR> <BR>Another way
    that &#39;Anonymous&#39; could build trust, is spend, say $500. or $1000. with
    a foundry and then ask for further breaks.  <BR> <BR>In business, &#39;established
    accounts&#39; often get additional perks. Again, the customer or prospect has
    to start by demonstrating responsibility alongside desire. <BR> <BR>Do I like
    distrust? No, I don&#39;t. <BR> <BR>If you want to continue to convolute every

    scribbles in a presentation. For one thing, it just takes up too much time, especially
    when you work on a pitch that has to be done on a very tight schedule &#40;and
    in this digital age... everything is on a tight schedule, I&#39;ve had prsentations
    with less than 4 days between briefing and final client presentation for a web
    site design that was massive, including 3D and video sequences and about four
    online technolgies we had to invent ourselves, so...  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know
    anybody below 40 who goes to the client with a handdrawn design. It&#39;s done
    on computers and it has to have the sleekness and perfection of the almost finished
    product. That isn&#39;t always a good thing &#40;less room for imagination&#41;
    and yeah, there are exceptions, but Jesus, reality is going to the client with
    the job almost done and THEN going into the process of changing stuff, not the
    other way around anymore.  <BR> <BR>So the only option is to buy fonts, just like
    artwork, software, services and other stuff, up front. That hurts, especially
    if you don&#39;t get the job. &#40;It&#39;s even worse in architecture, though,
    spending a six-figure-euro-sum on a pitch, as they usually do, without seeing
    any money if you loose... wow&#41;.  <BR> <BR>So, stealing software is not an
    option... but hand-drawn roughs aren&#39;t neither. And, imo, you can only judge
    a font if you actually worked with it. Not fiddled with Gifs or anything, if you
    wrked with the real thing, set some longer type in it, printed it... stuff like
    that.  <BR> <BR>Btw... I&#39;ve had the luck to get one of the Taz-Fonts up front
    before a presentation &#40;alas, it turned out to be wrong for that job&#41;,
    which was absolutely nice of Fontfabrik/lucasFonts&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The thing I
    do is to spend a bit of my profit on fonts I like, thus building up a nice library
    of fonts. &#40;And still, of course I just neeeeeeed some new stuff for every
    job...:-&#41;. '

    <BR>This is beginning to sound a bit &#39;I want, I want&#39;, but this idea is

    A large segment of the user community [if the assertion is true that &#40;I&#39;m
    generalizing here&#41; most graphic designers out there working do actively pirate
    fonts] isn&#39;t really showing the type foundries that it can be trusted.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Joe, I&#39;m not sure if you have a wide definition of &#39;active piracy&#39;
    or if you are misunderstanding me. <BR>I &#40;and probably many others&#41; use
    pirate font files for experimental work - playing around to see what face looks
    right for a piece of work &#40;as I said earlier, I would purchase any font which
    made it as far as a presentation to a client&#41;. But I don&#39;t BUY pirate
    font files, nor do I CIRCULATE pirate font files, nor do I hack, crack or otherwise
    mess around with font files. If you still see this as piracy, OK, but I just don&#39;t
    want you to think there are hordes of designers out there pirating fonts - people
    just use what&#39;s easiest, and leave it to their conscience to decide if and
    when they should pay up. <BR> <BR>There are certainly fonts out there that I have
    only ended up buying because I already had a pirate copy on my machine.'

    entourage is feeding you the disinformation - because you can&#39;t possibly be
    festering all of it yourself - but you should at least be conversant with the
    topic yourself before replying. <BR> <BR>I happen to be conversant with it, or
    I wouldn&#39;t be yapping about it. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;Or at best, over-the-hill
    methodology. <BR> <BR>Wrong again. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#40;And HD Schellnack had added,&#41;
    <BR> <BR>&#62;&#40;...&#41;you simply cannot work with rough font scribbles in
    a presentation. &#40;...&#41; <BR> <BR>By the way - to clarify, in case I was
    too subtle - I was not really focusing in my last post on the hand-drawn comped
    lettering so much as on the free ability of the graphic designer in need, to use
    online typesampler type.  <BR> <BR>Or to actually talk with their CD and/or client
    &#40;since some are client-contact&#41; about getting a working budget established
    for working tools....such as fonts. <BR> <BR>But to address Mr Papazian&#39;s
    remark, &#34;over-the-hill methodology&#34;, the hand-drawn approach certainly
    is not over-the-hill.  <BR> <BR>How can a designer&#39;s own creativity - the
    hand drawing - be &#39;over-the-hill&#39; in a design and presentation process?
    <BR> <BR>If it were, there wouldn&#39;t be scanner and software makers falling
    all over themselves since 1986 to market approaches to get hand drawn art into
    the computer, faster, easier and with optimal quality. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s technology
    that&#39;s readily usable in comping type for layouts. <BR> <BR>But again, in
    my last post I had focused on online sampler type as a perfectly good option,
    assuming that drawing might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea. <BR> <BR>A lot of
    art directors, after all, actually cannot draw. <BR> <BR>So, if they&#39;re not
    comfortable with drawing, use one of the other approaches. As long as one is not
    pirating fonts, or copying for the purpose of reproducing to sell resultant fonts
    on the open market, it&#39;s highly implausible that one of the approaches would
    ever cause any friction with digital foundries or other rights holders. <BR> <BR>Plus,
    when it comes to getting a comp done, they&#39;re fast.  <BR> <BR>And it keeps
    one from compromising one&#39;s integrity. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald Nicol
    said, <BR> <BR>&#62;When we use to do layouts with felt markers,  <BR>&#62;paint
    and brush or pencil there was more  <BR>&#62;flare to the artwork . The customers
    imagination <BR>&#62;filled in the blanks and they felt that  <BR>&#62;they had
    some input into the design process. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s absolutely right! Those
    are all wonderful. <BR> <BR>As is bringing the client into the process, instead
    of just feeding it to them and hoping they bite. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
    <BR>Hrant said, <BR> <BR>&#62;Do you think I&#39;m independently wealthy?&#40;...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Nope, I don&#39;t care about that, and I wasn&#39;t talking about it
    in that way at all.  <BR> <BR>I was merely clarifying my position on the earlier
    retort, <BR>&#34;The question is, can you put your discomfort  <BR>aside enough
    to work with reality, not against it?&#34; <BR>to what was really just an aside
    on my part.  <BR> <BR>And I don&#39;t expect you to understand the concept. <BR>
    <BR> <BR>&#62;But Joe seems to think text fonts are  <BR>&#62;only distinguished
    through their set-width... <BR> <BR>Once again, I have no idea where you have
    pulled such a fantastically untrue and quite ignorant statement like that from.
    <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Anonymous, I really don&#39;t know what I can add. <BR>&#62;If
    you still see this as piracy, &#40;...&#41; <BR> <BR>Using the fonts without permission,
    before buying a license, especially when you yourself pretty much agree that it
    is piracy? <BR> <BR>Yes, I guess I do still see it as piracy.  <BR> <BR>But more
    importantly, pretty much all of the civilized world does, and has said so through
    its laws and law enforcement. <BR> <BR>Despite that, I do appreciate your thoughts
    on it, and the snapshot of your own experience and how you choose to run your
    career. <BR> <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s something else about this idea of &#39;make all
    the fonts openly available, and I&#39;ll pay when I actually use something&#39;
    idea, that occurred to me this morning: <BR> <BR>&#40;Anonymous had said this,
    on August 19: <BR>&#62;What is the point of the post?  <BR>&#62;Well Font foundries,
    especially the big ones,  <BR>&#62;should be aware that the  <BR>&#62;&#39;don&#39;t
    pay until you use it for a real job&#39; method <BR>&#62;is quite widespread,
    so maybe they should  <BR>&#62;look into legitimizing it. ...&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Say
    we started using that approach. <BR> <BR>Today, you freely downloaded what you
    thought you needed to complete your exploratory for your asssignment&#40;s&#41;,
    free of charge. <BR> <BR>What if you were to use $400. of our fonts tomorrow,
    get the ad approved and produce it. <BR> <BR>Then, you die suddenly of natural
    causes, on Thursday. <BR> <BR>Say your use was instead, just $29. That you had
    actually successfully used just one font, and intended to pay for that one font?
    <BR> <BR>What would be our chance then, of ever getting paid for the high quality
    products of ours that you availed yourself of and used successfully? <BR> <BR>Very
    slim, to no chance, is the answer.  <BR> <BR>And were we ever to ever be paid,
    rest assured that it might not be for at least an additional year, and after much
    more time and expense to collect what was fairly due to us. <BR> <BR>The unexpected,
    death as an extreme example, isn&#39;t the only scenario that might wipe away
    possibility of payment. Sudden unemployment, that goes long term. The employer
    is hated and so the designer won&#39;t cooperate when bookkeeping calls looking
    for an explanation two months later of a &#39;font purchase with deferred payment&#39;
    and no job number or client code attached. Or the client goes under. Or your sole
    contact within that company is suddenly fired, and you cannot yourself get paid,
    or find anyone to talk to at the company about it? <BR> <BR>All those scenarios
    occur with great regularity. <BR> <BR>Potentially a bad enough happenstance dealing
    with a midsize to large ad agency or design studio. Very dangerous when dealing
    with a small or one person operation &#40;which most design and advertising firms
    are - one to 10 people&#41;. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s another example: I&#39;ve had
    one of the world&#39;s largest agencies hold us up for $35. for one year over
    something like that, before they finally paid.  <BR> <BR>Thirty-five dollars!
    And this was a company that&#39;s part of a conglomerate, where that one office,
    in NYC, was billing something like $100 million annually.  <BR> <BR>And we had
    a P.O. number and an agency Job number and the invoice had been submitted on time
    and approved by the A.D., who then left several weeks later. <BR> <BR>In any event,
    there are lots of reasons why simply working with your CD and client to establish
    a working tools budget up front, and paying at the time of purchase/intended use,
    is a better way of working proactively. <BR> <BR> <BR>Now, this really is my last
    post on this, more leading comments or not.  <BR> <BR>Apologies to the group members
    who think the design related discussion points should not be in a type-centric
    list like this. It seemed relevant. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR> <BR>'
