body: ' Hi, <BR> <BR>I was wondering if anyone could make things clearer for me concerning
  digital typeface production. I&#39;m currently working on my first typeface &#40;Typophile
  Forums: Critique: Sans Serif: Iris&#41; The face still needs some work!  <BR> <BR>I
  began the type face on paper, scanning in the characters and then re-drawing them
  in illustrator. I then imported them into FontLab to begin creating the type face.
  Being entirely new to font design, I&#39;ve spent a few days reading / working through
  the FontLab manual to try and get an understanding of how to use the application,
  and now my head hurts! <BR> <BR>The main problem is the file type - Truetype, Type
  1, font encoding, codepages etc - what&#39;s the deal with these - which should
  I use and why? The manual has confused me a little so I thought I&#39;d ask you
  boys. I currently work on a Mac, but want the type face to be &#39;cross-platform&#39;
  so do I need to take this into account at any early stage during the design process?
  <BR> <BR>Cheers for any advise that you can give me <BR> <BR>Darren '

    generate <BR>the different file type for the different OS&#39;s. '
