  of a high end speaker/components company (think bose, infinity, JBL etc). \r\n\r\nIm
  thinking a modern, luxurious, somewhat high tech looking face (i know.. kind of
  obvious.. but im definetely open to suggestions as well) Id like a face that works
  as a headline and body (different weights) but again, am wide open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n"

    with this product. Sophisto have a modern and rather slick attitude, if you ask
    me. And J Fry, you're welcome with further questions regarding Sophisto if you
    have any? Good luck!"

  body: "<cite>a high end speaker/components company (think bose, infinity, JBL etc)</cite>\r\n\r\nThis
    is actually \"mid-end\", for want of a better term, and the domain of fairly predictable
    corporate identities. Hi-fi manufacturers are generally good candidates for undistinguished
    and boring identities. But the deeper into hi-end territory you get, the more
    contrived and \"faux craft\" the identities become, ranging from your little nephew's
    attempts at geometric cool to pink marble mantelpieces with gold leaf borders.
    Try http://www.ear-yoshino.com/ for the chintzy version, or http://www.wadia.com/
    and http://www.wilson-benesch.com/ for the techie version. There's only one truly
    hi-end manufacturer who manages to translate sonic performance into an at least
    inoffensive identity, (http://www.lavardin.com), but they're French, so that doesn't
    count (just kidding, J-F). Mind you, they all have 1998-vintage websites. \r\n\r\nHm.
    Better get my anorak off, this will get out of hand. "

    It''s classy and contemporary at the same time, especially with the alternative

    but you can try the name of the company in the ''mud typer'' at Village, in the
    three versions. '

    guys were looking at it for a while. However setting the word \"PlayStation\"
    using the font it's a bit too close to that product's logo. Makes you wonder why
    Sony picked the Xbox-style Spiderman font for the PS3.\r\n\r\n> Fontshop: I had

    Only link that doesn't is the Australia link on the protal page. "

    one of the few markets where the internet did not much change the business model:
    sales are still based on in-store auditions, which may easily extend over a few
    days for a whole system. "

    talk for days to in-the-know sales staff to savor as long as possible the moment
    of purchase.  Perhaps it is foreplay to be followed by the orgasmic experience

  body: "In hi-fi there are many companies that don't last. Also, most of the shops
    don't have enough product line to really match components. I'd think that if you
    were spending several thousand dollars on a cartridge for your turntable you would
    want to do some research. I've only met a few people that can do a good job of
    matching systems. \r\n\r\nThat's why I linked to the Sota page. McIntosh is another
    hi-fi brand that has been around. Look at their mark.\r\nhttp://www.audioclassics.com/\r\n\r\nSeems
    trendy type may give an impression that there won't be a company to service your
    amp in a few years. \r\n\r\nHi-fi is like good type design in some ways maybe.
    Lots of pretenders and few people with enough skill to get all the details right.
    An esoteric persuit yes, but not to be dismissed as simple vanity. If you've noticed,
    our standards for high-quality music reproduction are doing down fast. It looks
    like information in the brave new world will be digital and highly compressed.\r\n\r\nI'm
    ranting and getting off topic."
