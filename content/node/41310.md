body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nCreated this typeface with FontForge after getting the bug one afternoon
  to finally (10 years after college) do something that I've wanted to do ever since
  I discovered the department's racks of lead type, and the stacks of specimen books
  in the graphic design lab.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the result is, I think, sort of a cross
  between a humanist sans-serif and a display/handwritten font.\r\n\r\nI laid out
  the stroke weights and shapes mostly by sight and comparison. I wanted, at larger
  sizes, more variety than you get with typical sans-serifs, but without verging too
  far into the script/hand written side of things.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let me know what
  you think.\r\n\r\nPS: No kerning pairs yet. Still trying to get good sidebearings.\r\n\r\nRich"

    Sample]]\r\n\r\nI named the font Urbino because I think it combines something
    of an uncial flair with a humanist aesthetic, and Urbino was, in the early Renaissance,
    a center of humanist education."
