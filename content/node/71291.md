body: "Hey everyone, \r\n\r\nNew to the forums here, been browsing and using this
  site for years but never posted. I'm after some advice for what fonts to use for
  my conference poster. \r\n\r\nOK I'm presenting an A0 poster at an antarctic research
  conference and am getting tired of my usual Caslon/Helvetica-Neue combo and wanted
  to change things up a bit. \r\n\r\nObviously its a little difficult to describe
  whet I have in mind. Its a science poster, thinking cooler colors, lots of white
  as it will have a few hairline diagrams on it. \r\n\r\nI've done a few years of
  design but I'm a science major and there is a prescription for poster making in
  the science realm so its quit easy to make some thing a little different by simply
  going outside their prescribed parameters (\"everything must be sans-serif\", \"force
  justify paragraphs\", \"do what we tell you\" etc...)\r\n\r\nSo I'm looking at trying
  to mix things up. What can everyone/anyone recommended? I don't mind buying a few
  fonts at the right price. I'm [i]liking[/i] the \"Economist\" for my body text and
  I really wanted to use \"Futura\" for headings and diagram labels but its just not
  fitting right for the main heading at the moment :S\r\n\r\nSuggestions please :)\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Thanks Tomi, but I feel like that's more of a sales pitch than a suggestion.
    What should I use your font? What should I use for the body? ... ???\r\n\r\nI'm
    looking for combination suggestion. Maybe some examples. Why this or that will
    or won't work. \r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "<cite>\"Its a science poster, thinking cooler colors, lots of white as it
    will have a few hairline diagrams on it.\"</cite>\r\nI'm thinking a clean, more
    recent, but maybe not too slick sans for headings should serve you well. But it's
    hard (and doesn't make very much sense I think) to give concrete advice and suggestions
    at this point because your brief is so open. There are, at this point, literally
    hundreds of combinations that could work well. \r\nBear in mind that we mostly
    don't share your background knowledge for instance of what these posters usually
    look like in your discipline*, and how you would like to pull yours away. We also
    don't know what your layout will look like, how much text you have, how many titles;
    should the titles be readable from a distance, or do you expect people to walk
    up to the poster anyway? Also, are there going to be formulas or Math stuff, or
    just \xABplain English\xBB text? \r\nAnd especially for the headline face: I'm
    guessing it should mostly feel clean? \u2013 Also, techy / serious / friendly
    and accessible / unusual / \u2026? Also, would you want your poster to look consciously
    designed (suggesting a more unusual typeface maybe), or mostly just  nicer-looking
    than your average science poster?\r\n\r\nSo if you could narrow down a bit (1)
    intended setup/structure/layout, (2) requirements to the typeface (figures, Math
    coverage, language coverage and such), and (3) the \xABflavor\xBB of what you're
    trying to achieve, that should make it easier to recommend specific faces.\r\n\r\n*
    Actually, pretty much all the science posters that I've seen around my part of
    the world have been pretty gruesome in terms of design, so you're off to a good
    start! :-)"

  body: Merkinz, could you post a mockup of the layout you'll be using?  You could
    just use greeking (placeholder text) if you wish, but it would help to know how
    the piece will actually look.

    me to point at \u201Csomething like\u201D Futura, but [[http://typophile.com/node/71254|much
    more smarter]] \u2013 and brandnew.\r\nFor body text you may want to try Andron
    which is a \u2018science typeface\u2019 (quite new).\r\n[[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=145|There\u2019s
    a free font]] available.\r\nIf your text deals more heavily with Math characters,
    Minion-derivated fonts from typoma.org may also be a very good choice."

  body: "Thanks for all the input. I'm working hard on the design at the moment so
    I'll upload a draft later on today for all to observe.\r\n\r\nThank you Nina for
    your post I think uploading a mockup will help convey what I'm trying to get across.
    So I'll answer your questions in detail when I upload the poster. Oh and by the
    way, I do want it to look \"designed\" very much so :) I want it to stand out
    and look a little different. ... even odd.\r\n\r\nThanks again. WATCH THIS SPACE."
