  cross over point in which type as a word and type as an image. I started to look
  at contempoary manifestations of typography as form but started to ask myself where
  the hell I am going with this. Do I cut it down to exploring  when 'words become
  images?'. My intrest lyes with the borderline when words 'as written functional
  form' cross over to becoming form/ images which represent the word with so much
  more meaning and emotion. Does this have any intrest or am i travelling the road
  of no return?"

    me that islamic calligraphic art is in your groove. In Islam only the word is
    allowed [img:sites/default/files/old-images/laillahaillaallah3.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/allah-hoo.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/miriam.jpg]
    for instance. I doubt if this is anything new to you but I think it's so good.
    Having a think about anything so obvoius in the western tradition.

  body: "All words are images, in the sense that we recognize, integrate and process
    words <strong>ideographically</strong>, that is, as an entirety, rather than as
    a sum of its parts. In this sense, words written with the roman alphabet (or any
    other alphabet) are no different from Chinese, which is purely ideographic. Virtually
    all conscious activity relies on <strong>pattern recognition</strong>, and words,
    taken individually, are discrete patterns (with discrete bouma, I am told).\r\n\r\nHowever,
    alphabetic languages have an advantage over ideographic languages when one encounters
    <strong>unfamiliar</strong> words; in these instances--depending on how regular
    the rules of pronunciation are in the language in question--you at least have
    some idea of what the word <strong>sounds</strong> like, even if you can't determine
    what it means. That is, unless the language is English, e.g., bough, cough, dough,
    through, tough.\r\n\r\nIn Arabic calligraphy, words become design (not images,
    which are forbidden); in a good deal of logotype design, words become pictures
    (brands); somewhere on this website, there's a link to Bembo's zoo, where letters
    become critters. Pictograms become letters, letters form words, words form ideograms,
    ideograms become pictograms -- it's a marvelous circular process.\r\n\r\n"

    with the 'image' connects you and the 'written ' word reveals itself.\r\nThey
    had the notion that when you wrote a word down you killed it, as the word only
    lives in your imagination. Their typographic work expresses the need to let the
    letter live when it is on the page so  illuminated the letter decoratively, in
    comparison with contempoary manifestations of type where type is used as image
    the type again has the notion of being alive having a personality and generates
    emotion with its audience.\r\n\r\nThe Islamic lettering is also of interest to
    me as a New Zealand/ European and know no other language other than english I
    read Islamic type as image and find the use of pos/neg space and the arrangement

  body: "There are so many interesting directions you could take. Many of the above
    suggestions are worth exploring, but I guess for a project topic you need to pick
    just one main direction and go with it.\r\n\r\nAs a conceptual matter, there is
    no necessary distinction between \"text\" and \"image.\" Text, as has been pointed
    out above with some great examples, IS image, in the sense that text is visual
    (well, unless read aloud?). If that seems like a trivial point, consider that
    there is no *visual* criterion by which we could distinguish \"writing\" from
    \"not writing\" whenever we encounter any highly decorative use of an unfamiliar
    script-- decorative inscriptions in Arabic are a perfect example. We might see
    it and NOT KNOW it's any kind of \"writing\" at all. Same for a  lot of graffiti--
    it often takes a while to see that within the dynamic and playful clusters of
    strokes, there may be something as simple as a tagger's name and/or some identifying
    information.\r\n\r\nI think this point at which a differece in *degree* (extreme
    but comprehensible stylization) becomes a difference in *kind* (we actually CANNOT
    TELL until it's explained to us) is a very interesting point, b/c it's both a
    cultural and a cognitive matter of whether we \"get\" what we're seeing or not.\r\n\r\nIt's
    also worth adding that the functional vs. artistic dichotomy is itself a relatively
    modern, Western notion. Where any kind of inscribed marking (\"writing\" or otherwise)
    serves a *ritualistic* function, it is kind of BOTH functional AND artistic AND
    more. You see that already in many nonwestern inscriptions and in Western but
    not-so-modern stuff like illuminated manuscripts. Doing script as \"glory to [pick
    your god]\" can't be broken down so easily into those functional vs. artistic
    categories-- the ART is what helps the writing serve the FUNCTION of propogating,
    glorifying, etc., one's belief system.\r\n\r\n- Jay\r\n"

  body: "Laura-- I agree with you, as my note above suggests (I think). I am interested
    in this very same set of questions. My sense is that it's probably not a good
    idea to search for a specific, lone criterion that distinguishes the two, but
    rather to focus on what features of what \"marking systems\" (my own way of putting
    it) are good at doing what kind of thing. Phonemic alphabetics, e.g., do a fairly
    decent job (with varying success) at presenting a graphic clue about sound. The
    IPA does it better, though. Pictures can make an impression, but they can't lay
    out an <em>explicit</em> cluster of premises, claims, conditional statements,
    etc., quite as well as text (alphabetic or not-- Chinese, e.g., is written and
    read \"serially\" but isn't alphabetic). \r\n\r\nThe only way I've been able to
    make a distinction between \"text\" and \"nontext\" is not too different from
    yours-- it has something to do with what is made explicit and what isn't, what
    is meant to convey points A, B, and C to any given audience, and what can convey
    points X, Y, and C to a specific audience provided they have the right contextual
    knowledge. \r\n\r\nLest this sound like a bunch of jibber-jabber, consider the
    photo below:\r\n\r\n\r\nSome would say that it may make quite an impact but can't
    really articulate an <em>argument</em> the way a text could. On that line of thinking,
    a picture is NOT really worth a thousand words. But if we say that such a picture
    conjures up all kinds of claims, evidence, reasoning, conclusions, etc., provided
    one has the contextual knowledge to bring to one's viewing of it, then a picture
    may be worth a whole lot MORE than a thousand words.\r\n\r\nNow, this makes things
    a lot easier for those wondering whether type is an image or not, or what criteria
    there are for separating them. The examples above are nice-- they show all kinds
    of funky ways \"letters\" can be given pictorial embellishments. But if you want
    to talk about can even, say, a simple Times New Roman \"A\" be seen as an IMAGE,
    well, the answer is YES obviously. Then, if we want to say, but can it make an
    \"argument,\" again, the answer is YES, but ONLY if we see it in some context
    that gives us an \"A\" in the form of some kind of argument (A-list, a grade of
    \"A\", The A-Team, etc.). The triangular, upward-pointing \"shape\" helps, of
    course, but the letter being in the first position of the conventional Latin alphabet
    does, too.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is cool stuff you're interested in. ANd not simple.
    I won't pretent what I'm saying answers it all. Just some speculations.\r\n\r\n-
