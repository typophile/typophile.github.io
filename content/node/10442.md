body: 'I&#39;m currently &#40;purely as a hobby project&#41; developing a font which
  takes much of its inspiration from the carolingean minuscule. There it seems that
  an alternative variant of the letter r often is used after rounded characters -
  mostly o, but perhaps also after b and p? <BR> <BR>But how does it look, really?
  First I drew a glyph based on my initial impression of the nature of this variant:
  like the right part of a capital R. But after some further inspection of the few
  authentic instances that I was able to find on the &#39;net, I noticed that it instead
  looked more like a 2, and made a new glyph in that direction: <BR> <BR><a href="http://home.student.uu.se/jowi4905/mix/oror.png">
  Two variants of the alternative r.</a> <BR> <BR>Am I right in my first guess, that
  the alternative shape of r has developed as I described &#40;from the right hand
  part of a regular R&#41;? And does the first one of my two glyphs occur in medieaeval
  manuscript, and if so, how common is it compared to the &#34;2&#34; variant? That
  is, how unauthentic would it be, if I used the first variant &#40;seeing that it
  probably is slightly more legible for modern readers than the second one&#41;? <BR>
  <BR>Also, what is it called &#40;if anything special&#41;? &#40;I tried searching
  for information on this, but I found it difficult to find much, since I didn&#39;t
  know what to call it.&#41;'

  body: "This form of 'r' was in common use in Irish manuscripts until the 17th century
    and it was also used in early Irish typefaces - the Queen Elizabeth typeface of
    the 16th century and the Rome and Louvain typefaces of the 17th century. I am
    sending a scan of a page from the first book ever printed in Irish (1571) as a
    new thread (it seems it isn't possible to do so in a reply). The scan shows the
    alternate 'r' highlighted in red. The contexts are as follows: 1. 'm\xF3r', 2.
    'shaot(h)air', 3. 'ort', 4. 'uair.\r\n\r\nThe character doesn't seem to have been
    included in any of the 18th century typefaces. My impression is that its use in
    manuscripts also declined during the 18th century and had probably ceased by the
    19th century (except in cases where the scribe was trying to make a facsimile
    of an older manuscript). \r\n\r\nMore recently, I have included the character
    in my 'Seanchl\xF3 na Nod' and 'Bunchl\xF3 na Nod' fonts - fonts that were created
    for those who wish to transcribe manuscripts. The alternative 'r' from 'Bunchl\xF3
    na Nod' can be seen in the table of common manuscript characters on the following
    page at the University College Cork website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ucc.ie/faculties/celtic/lss/lit.jpg\r\n\r\nIn
    this font, I followed the common scribal practice of having the bowl of the 'r'
    the same height as a 'c' and turning the leg of the 'r' into a descender. \r\n\r\nWith
    respect to usage, the tendency in Ireland (both in manuscript and print) was to
    use the alternative 'r' in final positions at the end of words. Its use in medial
    positions was less common, and I have never seen it used in an initial position.
    I haven't noticed that there was a greater tendency to use it with round characters,
    but '-or' is a common ending in both Latin and Irish so this combination is especially
    common (however '-ir' is also a common ending in Irish and the alternative 'r'
    often occurs in this combination.\r\n\r\nVincent Morley\r\n\r\n"
