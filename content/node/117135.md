body: "So I really would like to know what those special glyphs inside of Bello's
  glyph-set are called? So for example the glyphs that say \"the\" or \"and\" or \"the
  end\" etc.\r\n\r\nI know these are part of a glyph set but I'm wondering is there
  any particular terminology for these types of glyphs? If so what are they called?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  does anyone know of any good typefaces that have these as part of their glyph set?
  Or any typefaces that are simply word based as opposed to letter based?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Richard Angstadt, Charles M. Ellertson, Richard Hendel, Naomi B. Pascal, Anita
    Walker Scott. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994), these are called <em>logotypes</em>:

    Playing</a> (by James Montalbano; Terminal Design) comes to mind first. Its font

    looking for and it was a great learning experience as well.\r\n\r\nI always new
    the word \"logotype\" in the more traditional form as in \"a logo that is completely
    derived from type\". Thanks for enlightening me on the proper terminology."
