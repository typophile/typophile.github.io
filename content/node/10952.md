body: 'hi, i&#39;ve just been working on these today, they are round 1. my idea was
  incorporating bookspine orientation into the bookstore&#39;s logo. your thoughts
  are welcomed. typeface=futura. colour ideas=still open but leaning towards flourescents.
  of course there are grayscales as well but they&#39;re boring: &#41; <BR> <BR>a&#41;

  body: 'Oh. Andrea, are you in Vancouver? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not a good person to judge
    whether this is a good logo idea overall: I&#39;m not a graphic designer, and
    my approach to a design problem is simply to work at a single solution until it
    is perfect, usually ignoring any question of whether a different solution might
    be better. <BR> <BR>I think A and C are working much better than B, in both colour
    and arrangement. Some suggestions for improvement: <BR> <BR>Shorten the ascender
    on the lowercase b in the vertical lettering. It sticks out way too far. See how
    short you can get it and still have a legible b. <BR> <BR>Adjust the alignment
    of the three words so that the left side of the O A and B are optically aligned.
    In your current versions the O is too far right and the B too far left, creating
    a visual slant. <BR> <BR>In the A and C arrangment, there is more optical white
    space below the word &#39;Art&#39; than above it. See if you can balance this.
    <BR> <BR>I think the words look much better closer to the &#39;spine lettering&#39;
    as in C. <BR> <BR>Here is a modified version with these suggestions applied: <BR><img

    <BR>Finally, I recommend providing two versions, one with &#39;Vancouver&#39;s
    Art Book Stores&#39; incorporated as in C, and one without this line. Both will
    be useful.'

  body: 'thanks john, i appreciate your feedback and i agree with your suggestions.
    especially shortening the descender. now when i look at the &#34;oab&#34; of logo
    b all i see is an excited flourescent snowman. <BR> <BR>yes i am in vancouver!
    in case you know anyone else that would be interested &#40;maybe keith would be
    as well&#41; oscar&#39;s is having a logo contest with $500 books as payment for
    the designer. oscar&#39;s is one of my favourite bookstores so that&#39;s why
    i&#39;m doing this in the first place... thanks again for your help: &#41; '

  body: 'Andrea, i think that the speech of the logo is a little redundant or ambiguous,
    is this a store or a chain of stores, is &#40;or are&#41; the stores from vancouver
    or from oscar. &#40;well maybe i perceve redundance because i almost never speak
    english&#41;. <BR> <BR>Redundace comes too when you repeat Art Store Twice, and
    the capitals OAB twice too. Take a look: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.identityworks.com/Issues/issues1.html"
