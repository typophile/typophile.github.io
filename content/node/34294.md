body: "I've been working on several fonts with FontLab Studio 5.0.3, and I keep running
  into problems with kerning. The kerning in the metrics window looks good, but the
  generated fonts (TTF and OT) don't seem to have any kerning when I test them in
  Illustrator CS2. I'm including a link to a .vfb file, which ought to show what I'm
  doing wrong:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.russpix.com/Murcielago.vfb"

    on you will probably add one or more features on the OT-panel, and then the kerning
    will work.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Russ,\r\nThe amount of features doesn't matter. But you should start with
    the proper codepage.\r\nEither Mac OS Roman or MS Windows Western. Something went
    wrong from the very beginning. I recommend to start a fresh codepage (see above),
    copy and paste your glyphs into this new codepage and do the kerning anew. Update
    the kern feature from time to time.\r\n\r\nRalph"

  body: I created a new page, with Mac OS Roman, then pasted the alphabet into the
    new page. After rebuilding the kerning I can now generate a font that kerns in
    Illustrator. Thanks for the suggestions.

  body: I thought I had this figured out, but I guess I don't. I kerned a few pairs
    on another font, generated it and tested the kerning. I worked. That gave me confidence
    to continue. So much for my optimism. After spending quite a bit of time with
    the kerning in FontLab, it doesn't work when I generate the font. How do I troubleshoot
    this problem?

  body: OK a little update; it seems to be a bug with the kerning in FontLab 5.0.3
    for Mac. I will make a post if noone else already have.

  body: "Thanks for the info Goran. I'm using FontLab on a PC, so I'm not sure if
    the same problem exists. I think FontLab may have a memory leak though. Several
    times I've left it running overnight, and when I look at my computer in the morning,
    FontLab has quit.\r\n\r\nI added a ligature feature to a couple of fonts I've
    been having trouble with, and still no success. The generated fonts don't show
    the kerning. I added it to another font, and that one worked, but it was the first
    time I had generated that font, so I don't know if that is the reason for success.
    Frankly, the kerning in FontLab has me discouraged. Sometimes it works. Sometimes
    it doesn't. No error messages. I've read most of the section on kerning in the
    manual, but still haven't figured out what I'm really doing wrong. Am I the only
    one this happens to?"
