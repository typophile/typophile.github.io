    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_good_wide_light_lf_osf/\">FF
    Good Light</a> can be licensed for $44.00 \u2014 not that expensive considering
    what you get. And <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/lacuna.font\">Lacuna</a> is
    free.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks Miss Tiffany.\r\n\r\nI like them both, I just am curious if there
    is another typeface upon which they are based or are similar to (like cousins,
    for example...) !\r\n\r\nApparently, FF Good Wide Light is free too, however,
    when you visit the FF site, it is not featured under the \"free\" downloads...
    I am just a little disappointed is all and looking for an alternative. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes. FF Good Wide Light was a featured free font last month I believe. \r\n\r\nThey
    are quite different from one another. But I gather you are leaning toward FF Good,
    yeah? And you are hoping for Free? While I'd really suggest licensing FF Good
    as it will become a tool* which you can use again and again. But, if it is free
    that you are after I can point you toward:\r\n\r\n- <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/11/08/40-excellent-freefonts-for-professional-design/\">40+
    Excellent Freefonts For Professional Design</a>.\r\n- <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/44453?\">FAQ
    Free Fonts</a> Typowiki entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Always better to opt for quality
    in terms of tools to be used in the long term."

  body: "Hey Miss Tiffany!\r\n\r\nThanks very much.\r\n\r\nYes, I agree, I think at
    a certain point... (when income is sufficient) it will be a definite priority
    to obtain the finest versions of fonts of the highest quality. For now, I am trying
    my best to be considerate and also to use the faces which best suit my needs and
    my client's desires...\r\n\r\nThank you anyways and I will consider your thoughts
    in my purchase-decisions in the future.\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\n\r\nJaz"
