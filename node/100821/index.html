  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everybody,

which free fonts do you consider the best to publish books? I will self publish books under CC, that's why they must be free. There are some amazing ones that are non-free, especially from Adobe, but I couldn't fine anyone that was clean, light and elegant enough to provide a pleasant reading. So maybe you know some. ;)

By the way [[http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/02/30-of-the-best-font-foundries/|this website]] contains a description of "Stone Type Foundry", the same font in the attached image. I was astonished how beautiful and elegant it is, and I think it must be perfect to publish a book. Unfortunately it's paid. But what do you think of it? Just curious.

Thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry, your "best" question doesn't make sense. If there were a "best," everyone would be using it; it would be all over the net. So first step is "best" for what? Romantic poetry? Historical fiction? Social sciences? Physics? And ink on paper or pixels on screen? If on screen, PDF or EPUB?

Moving on, I know current publishers call themselves "content providers." Which is silly, the author is the content provider. The publisher's role is, say, that of "content assurer." The work of editors and designers (and typesetters) adds a level of quality few authors can bring to their content. Think about that.

I'd assume by "free" you mean what's generally meant by "libre." "Libre" with fonts means, usually, that the license permits unlimited use, except for (re)selling the fonts. But licenses vary, you need to understand them.

All of that said, I'm an advocate of libre fonts. And almost all of them need some work to be brought up to first-class status. "Best of the ho-hum" isn't a particularly good place.

Sumner Stone's done fine work over the years. A polished professional. What you would expect from the guy who, when at Adobe, hired Slimbach & Twonbly & generally built Adobe's font department in earlier days...

However, most of his fonts were drawn when ink was put on paper in a slightly a different way, and have not been re-weighted for DTP printing. Some find that a problem. But web and ink are different...

You sure you don't want some quality assurance?</div>

Btw: When judging a typeface, you need to look at it in context. The letterforms of Sator might look beautiful up close and alone, but it tells you nothing about how it will preform in your book. And that list, while it contains some interesting foundries, is utter bull crap. Never trust those lists. That’s the road to perdition.</div>

By "best" I mean fonts that are "clean, light and elegant enough to provide a pleasant reading", in other words: fonts that are beautiful and do not cause our eyes to get tired. The books will be non-fiction, mostly social sciences. They will be released only in PDF.

I don't understand anything about professional publishing and the structure behind it, however publishing books will be mainly a hobby to me, and I still have plenty of time to study more about the field.

Yes, by "free" I mean "libre".

Thank you for your opinion on Sumner Stone's work, it is much appreciated.

<strong>Frode Bo Helland:</strong>
A CC-license does not require a libre font, I just want to use them because I want to make the work entirely free, from the content to the font, and (correct me if I am wrong) I think that depending on the font you use you have to embed it in the PDF file.

Thanks for the tip about the website, I agree with you. I think website owners worry more about making profit than delivering good content these days, lol.

<strong>quadiblock:</strong>
Those fonts are beautiful, especially Linden Hill, but I think they are very small. They only looked a little better at 14 pt. Anyway, thank you for your help, I liked the website and the fonts look cool.</div>

FWIW, I have used a reworked version of Charis-SIL in this context. Two books set in Charis, designed by Cherie Westmoreland, were selected for the AAUP Book Show. To the best of my knowledge, these are the only Libre fonts ever used in an AAUP Book show selection.

Charis-SIL is esentially the same as Bitstream Charter, a font family designed by Matthew Carter (a MacArthur grant recipient). It is not, perhaps, generally regarded as an elegant font, but is eminently readable.

Modifications we made were basically in spacing, and cutting old-style numbers -- not particularly needed for social sciences.

A good companion sans, if you want one, is Lato.

I can look tomorrow for an Amazon "Look Inside" to show it's use...

Yes, most likely, but there is no reason why you can’t embed a commercial font in a PDF, as long as the EULA allows it or you negotiate a special deal with the foundry.

I don’t mind if you want to use a free font, I’m just curious as to why.</div>

Well, the answer <em>has</em> to be "yes" to those questions if the book itself is under an open-source license. So you have to be able to do those things to every part of the book in the format (i.e. .doc, .odt, .pdf) in which it will be distributed - and that includes the fonts.

Now, why he would need to make his book open-source instead of just free as in beer is unclear. Perhaps it's a nonfiction book to which others could usefully add. Or perhaps it includes extensive quotation from another book that's under an open-source license, in which case it <em>must</em> be open-source. Or perhaps he chose to have that license to support the open-source movement.</div>

<cite>"Now, why he would need to make his book open-source instead of just free as in beer is unclear."</cite>

I want to make the books "free as in freedom" (aka "libre"), under CC-BY and CC-BY-SA. The books will be computer manuals. You're right, in this case it's not obligatory to use libre fonts, I could use commercial fonts "with exceptions", but as I support software libre, I want to make them completely libre if possible, from the font until the content. That's the reason.

<strong>quadiblock</strong> and <strong>Frode Be Helland:</strong>
The books will be released in PDF to the general public, but they will also be released in ODF format in case others want to modify it. ;)

...

I will look at the websites and fonts you provided and post my opinion here. If you have any more suggestions please post here. Your help is very appreciated!
