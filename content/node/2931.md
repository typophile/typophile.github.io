  body: Didn&#39;t find it on T-26. Though this one is really easy  <BR>to recreate,
    I think it&#39;s <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00000ILNN.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"
    target="_blank"> not custom</a>.

  body: I think it&#39;s a custom font created by <a href="http://www.thedesignersrepublic.com"
    target="_blank">tDR</a>. They created the logos and packaging for the Wipeout
    games. They also did the Model 500 album covers.
