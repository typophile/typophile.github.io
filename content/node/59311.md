  body: "most likely a custom mark, not a font.\r\n\r\nbut if you google\r\n\r\n\"jolly
    rancher\" and \"font\"\r\n\r\nyou'll see that someone made this into a font."

  body: Well if it's for a business need surely you can talk your employer into letting
    you access the site, download the font and install it on your work machine...although
    I'm scratching my head about a business reason for wanting to make something look
    like Jolly Rancher.
