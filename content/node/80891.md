  Jenson's mark \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NicolasJenson_6329.png]\r\nand
  I'm certain I've seen Garamond sign work with an anchor & fish but I can't find
  it anywhere.\r\nDid Baskerville have a personal mark? The Didot lineage, Pietro
  Bembo, Pierre Simon Fournier?\r\n\r\nThere is no start date and no end date to bookend
  my request. But I guess I'm looking for the legends of serf development.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatt\r\n"

    and dolphin</a> is the mark of Aldus Manutius and his heirs, not Garamond.\r\n\r\nAnother
    famous printer/publisher mark is that employed by the \u2018Stephani\u2019, i.e.
    Robert Estiennes and his heirs, a woodcut depicting a man standing beneath an
    olive tree from which branches are falling, draped with the motto <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_sG8sCbFmYUU/ShMAVumSK-I/AAAAAAAAAEw/l0eLvLCy_jg/s400/colophon1559.woodcut.png\"><em>altum
    sapere noli</em> (<em>sed time</em>)</a>.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg have produced
    an online version of Roberts\u2019 <em><a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25663/25663-h/25663-h.htm\">Printers\u2019
    Marks</a>.</em> As you will see from perusing the table of contents, such marks
    fell out of fashion after the 16th Century, and did not reappear until the fashion
    for things mediaeval and renaissance in the later 19th Century.\r\n"
