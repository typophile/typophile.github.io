  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you consider saving money on your energy bill, most people think about ways that they can go about reducing the amount of energy that their home uses. This is a time honored practice of reducing energy bills, and something that everyone should consider. However, if you live in the state of Ohio, thanks to energy deregulation, you have another very effective way of saving money on your energy bills. The way you can do this, is to have competition within the energy industry, something that up till 1997 wasn&rsquo;t available.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Deregulation has allowed people to choose from various energy providers throughout Ohio. Most Ohio residents have at least two, if not multiple, choices for energy companies. In addition to private energy, such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->deregulation of energy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, there are also a number of local and state operated utility companies that provide utility services as well. Typically, you&rsquo;ll find that private energy providers, such as first energy Ohio, offers better prices than government run utility companies. However, in some cases, you might find that the government run utility companies offer better customer service. You may need to consider what&rsquo;s more important to you, having cheap prices or being treated well. Of course, the best option is to find a company that offers both.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There is, however, some detractors of energy deregulation and one of the concerns, especially in the state of Ohio, was having to deal with potential outages as well as upgrades to the existing power grid. In an attempt to ensure that residents of Ohio were able to choose their own energy company, and choose an energy plan that offered them quality service and cost savings, it was made mandatory that state and local utility providers were still obligated to maintain the existing power grid, regardless of which company operates that particular grid. What this did was to successfully dispel any concerns over overlapping of services and equipment, which could leave the consumer in a very difficult position should the power lines need to be repaired or upgraded.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>As you can see, whether you choose first energy or any one of the other 23 energy companies available, you now have a choice. This allows you to get better service and better prices as utility companies are finally vying for your business. While competition was virtually nonexistent before 1997, today, as a resident of Ohio, you can enjoy the competitive energy market where you are getting quality utility services at lower than average prices. Considering how much money people have to spend on utilities, the potential savings are tremendous, and it is one of the reasons why many other states are actively looking into deregulating their energy industry.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
