body: I&#39;ve historically had problems with pixel font families offering regular,
  bold, and italics. Too often, they look like three separate faces to me. I have
  seen a few though, that in my opinion really succeed. <BR> <BR>So I&#39;m trying
  to play with a bold and regular version of a new face I&#39;ll call Raster for now.
  My question here is, how successfull ar the two as a family? For the most part,
  it works for me, but I&#39;m not sure over all. <BR> <BR>The regular version looks
  a little too wide--fat even, compared to the bold. In fact, the x-height looks higher
  in the regular version too. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35606.gif"
