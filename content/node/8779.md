body: Looking for the font used in the Lonely Planet Guides. The main Sans serif on
  the front. Any ideas, it looks quite easy to identify but I&#39;ve only come close
  so far. Also I&#39;d like to identify the logo if possible. Cheers. <BR> <BR>P.S.
  Sorry if I&#39;veasked this before but I can&#39;t seem to find the post. <BR> <BR><img

    target="_blank"> Syntax Black</a> or the extra bold version of <a href="http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_sans/sans_extra.html"
    target="_blank"> Foundry Sans</a> <BR>Do you have other samples?
