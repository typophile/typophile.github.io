  but has anyone here ever been to Normandy?

    easy way to travel around without renting a car? If I wanted to hide on a beach
    for a few days, would you recommend any?\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, <strong>is there
    any cool lettering</strong> to see?\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "As for buses and public transport it's fairly ok - trains are great too in
    between larger cities. I \u201Cbused\u201D from Caen to Honfleur a few times:
    a few back and forth rides per day are available - on this ride you will cross
    Deauville and Trouville which have many fine beaches (and amazingly beautiful
    houses). Houlgate and Cabourg are also nice - so I heard.\r\n\r\nAs for lettering,
    most probably in older parts. Dont realy recall. The shops in Honfleur's Port
    must have some good stuff..."
