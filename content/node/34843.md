    apparently, until the servers-in-the-sky update their listings.

  body: OK, this is really the end of early bird. You have until midnight tonight,
    Pacific Time, to register and get the lowest price on TypeCon admission. It's
    still a super deal after early bird, but we are happy to help you save some bucks
    so you can buy new type books and more sushi... sushi... sushi...
