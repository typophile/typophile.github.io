  of a typeface's design/progress, couldn't you also use it to identify typefaces?
  As it shows all the stroke variations used throughout a typeface, it should be a
  pretty good way to discern different typefaces.\r\n\r\nI'm curious also how everyone
  here goes about identifying typefaces. A lot of it is experience, but are there
  any other tips/tricks that anyone wants to share? "

    kiddin\u2019).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s experience - looking at a lot of type over years.
    That will give you a feeling for where to look. Other than that it\u2019s sometimes
    spotting that glyph that stands out (or gives it away as Yves would say)."

  body: "Sometimes it also helps to learn a few extrinsic facts about a typeface,
    such as who designed it, or where it's name comes from. It helps to jog your memory
    a little faster when you're at the \"I know I've seen this somewhere before...\"
    phase of the ID. \r\n\r\nI started using this method a few years ago to help with
    my almost pathological inability to remember people's names. While it hasn't really
    worked in that respect, it's done wonders for typeface IDs. "

  body: "Years (and years) ago, it was the beginning of my learning about type. One
    art director told me to memorize every R. It is a common letter and can be found
    in most type samples, and is never quite the same from typeface to typeface.\r\n\r\nThen
    working with type, I learned a lot more. (I wish I had retained it all, but it's
    slipping away from non-use.)\r\n\r\nCatogorizing the fonts and just looking at
    them day to day is a wonderful exercise. I may not remember the name, but I remember
    the year VGC put it on their typositor book, or that it started with the letter
    R and was in the old yellow book around the shop...\r\n\r\nMore modern times,
    I have found Font Expert a help -- it is like the FBI with fingerprints. Doesn't
    always works, but when it does, wahoooo... Yes, identifont is a great tool, and
    the folks above have it right - Mike Yangega (especially in \"line\" type) is
    a great guide.\r\n\r\nTake a friend with you into a bookstore and start guessing
    when you see typefaces you recognize... feels good doesn't it?\r\n\r\nP.S. It
    isn't whatthefont.com but... http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/\r\nMake sure
    the image file is a small file - and it works a lot of the time..."
