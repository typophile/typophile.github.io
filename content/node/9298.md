  body: Sorry, Scott, but this isn&#39;t a font.  There&#39;s too many disparities
    between the letters, such as the e&#39;s and a&#39;s are all different. <BR> <BR><a

    target="_blank"> Cezanne</a> seems right up your alley, though.

  body: Please, not another place to use Cezanne!  <BR> <BR>I think there must be
    some other handwriting font that has a freeflowing, spontaneous feeling without
    using that font again. It&#39;s becoming such a clich

  body: Sorry, Mike.. didn&#39;t know I was pulling a heartstring! <BR> <BR>Scott,
    you could also try some of the script fonts over at <a href="http://www.oldfonts.com/emilyaustin.html"
    target="_blank">OldFonts</a>... they have a good collection of flowing yet quirky
    scripts that fit your sample well.  I recommend Emily Austin.

  body: I was really torn. What made me think it was a typeface was the &#34;m.&#34;
    I was hoping it was a freeflowing typeface, like you said, Mike. But I&#39;ll
    see if I have one of the typefaces you both recommended in my library. No budget
    for a new purchase, so I may be back. Thanks for the input from you both. <BR>

  body: Scott, OldFonts&#39; page has demos of all of its fonts.  You could try downloading
    them and see how far you get, if they are still a route you&#39;d like to follow.
