  the W midway in size between lowercase and uppercase, it leaves me unsure whether
  it's a separate word. Why the jumping baseline? And why is the letter order changed
  in the black box? \r\nI think it's very weird indeed :/\r\n"

  body: I think the jumping baseline has something to to with water. I actually think
    they did a rather good job organising such a long name visually. The mark is wierd
    though.

  body: "They have a building in my town, and the huge logo on it has been annoying
    the heck out of me for a while. I don't get the jumping baseline. To me this looks
    like <em>three guys founded a serious-acting company together but the youngest
    of them is constantly acting the clown, giggling about stuff nobody else finds
    funny, and thinking he's so very special. The others are vaguely annoyed about
    him but then again, hey, he brings in \"dynamism\".</em>\r\n\r\nThat, or horizontal
    kerning was getting boring. :-\\\r\n\r\nBut LOL, I never realized the order is
    different in the black box. I might just start calling them PriceCaterhouseWoopers
    now."

  body: "Exactly. It's a bizarre effect, all jolly in the middle like that. I can
    kind of see why they've jiggled the letters to make the shapes fit into each other
    but I don't really dig the result.\r\n\r\nLOL PriceCaterhouseWoopers ;D\r\n"
