  seem to figure out what it is. It's similar to Akkurat in the way the lower-case
  'L' is treated, but it's definitely a different font.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.septemberindustry.co.uk/images/soto.jpg\r\nhttp://www.septemberindustry.co.uk/images/soto5.jpg\r\n"

  body: This seems to be a version of <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?HG6">AG
    Schoolbook</a> with some glyph alternates and, more importantly, with a stroke
    applied. The proper bold cut (or, as they dub it, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-schoolbook-bq/medium/">Medium</a>)
    looks slightly different and, well, better.
