  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys. I was recently approached by a publisher of historical novels to help develope their identity and wanted to ask for your advice on the type choice. The books aren’t confined to any specific period which makes it a little harder. The identity wil have to work online, so I’m particulary interested in well hinted @font-face licensed fonts.

FF Clifford is the first thing that came to mind, as it is relatively silent all the while it’s ruggedness really fits my bill, and the optical sizes and hinting is spot on. I’ve also looked into antique map fonts, like for example Tierra Nueva, and consider trying a modern/didone of some kind. (Whatever I end up using should be relatively consistent in a historical context, so I probably won’t mix Clifford with any didones … Just saying.) Nick Shinn’s Figgins Sans is also on my list.

They use Trajan (the obivious choice) in their logo, but I hope to be able to tweak that one ever so slightly without abandoning the feel of it.

I’m not only looking for web ready text fonts, but also just plain display stuff. Any ideas and/or inspiration when it comes to graphic style or type treatment are also welcome. 

I’m basically trying to create something generic ancient, while hopefully managing to avoid the clichés.

Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rather than choose a single text typeface for the entire series, I'd suggest working out a more flexible but easily recognizable visual identity, which could accommodate different typefaces for different books -- especially books about different historical periods. (Not that the typeface has to be from the same period, just that it has to feel compatible.) That would also give you the flexibility to use a different typeface online than on paper, if need be.

That said, as you asked about "antique map fonts," I'd suggest taking a look at Mark van Bronkhorst's MVB Sirenne family, which was based on the engraved lettering used for captions and other map-like information in an 18th-century book from a map publisher in Amsterdam.

		<div class="commentbody">I thought about choosing [[http://www.fontbureau.com/media/pdf/PoynterOSText.pdf|Poynter]] for a book project lately. It is elegant (cap P, G, Q etc), yet relatively generic in style. Though having it's roots in low-country Renaissance it could fit Baroque and later texts too. Plus you can get different optically scaled variants for different sizes and [[http://www.webtype.com/font/poynterserifre-family/|a well hinted version for the web]] via webtype. Or maybe you find some others over there. http://www.webtype.com/catalog/style/?ts=692

But Clifford is a good pick, too, the FF-fonts usually work well on screen. 
I'd go for some late moderate Renaissance or Baroque face, something that sits a bit in between the historic periods and doesn't resemble one particular style so much.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry for the late response. These are excellent suggestions! Thank you. I really like Poynter. Both it and Clifford are my best bets for now, for text use. I’m particulary drawn to Clifford for the optical sizes. That’s one helluva overlooked aspect of web design.

As for different typefaces for different books, John, the books already have their own set of fonts that does not necessarily adhere to their historical period. 

I’ll have to ask Nick about the rendering quality of Figgins.

Sirenne is also an excellent idea. I’m up for more suggestions, btw.

For Christmas, mum bought me a dictionary of symbols which should get me started on that front.

They’re very passionate about the whole thing (the head guy lives in an old prison filled with art, books, pipes (yeay!), grandfather clocks and tons of antiques), but they did chose a not-so-great designer the first time around which makes me somewhat vary about how much they’ll really appreciate my work.</div>

Is it the Liungman volume? Or something else?

Your idea regarding older symbols is nice, yet requires some deeper research, perhaps. The fist is always fitting, I suppose. Maybe, you ought to go to a library and scroll through the advertising pages of old newspapers. Gorgeous graphics are to be found in that quite often.</div>
