  it called \"Gaelic Type\" as well. I am hoping that someone has already made this
  so I don't have to do it myself! \r\n\r\nIt seems like the Hebrew script would be
  this quite well, not just because it shares the fact that there are no capital letters.
  Do you know that font that is over all of the Irish pubs across the world? That
  is what I am thinking (with the option to add in dots or flourishes). \r\n\r\nSomething
  like <img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Gaelic-text-Duibhlinn.png\"></img>\r\n\r\nI'm
  not referring to the 'sword' typeface used in The Hobbit movie. The closest thing
  I found was on someone's engraving service. <img src=\"http://www.cjstones.com/prod_images/lettering/HebrewScript.jpg\"></img>"
