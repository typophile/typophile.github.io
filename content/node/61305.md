body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI'm currently working up a nameplate for a student magazine. The
  magazine features mostly news features and opinion and will be published four times
  in the academic year. The magazine is reasonably high-brow and serious, but with
  a student focus. Anyway, for the nameplate/flag/logo/wordmark, I drew on inspiration
  from the [[http://images.nymag.com/gfx/sect/home/logo.gif|New York Magazine's nameplate]].\r\n\r\nWith
  some help from the Type ID board here, I settled on Bellevue. There are some really
  beautiful swashes in Bellevue, but unfortunately the M doesn't have any. So I'd
  like to butcher some of the swashes from other characters and Frankenstein them
  onto the M.\r\n\r\nIn the attached image, from top to bottom: Unaltered, first version,
  second version. I like that there's more to the second version, but with scaling
  the swashes up and down I feel the scale and weight of the strokes have suffered.
  Any help appreciated!"

    baseline? Or making an alternative 'y'? Or both?\r\n\r\nBTW. That M reminds me
    of the Monocle magazine logo. A good association maybe.\r\n\r\n________\r\n<a

    above the baseline, which to me is distracting. Otherwise, beautful shape. '

    up a new version tomorrow and post the result. Thanks!

    due to my university's proxy weirdness, but here's a link to the file anyway:
    [[http://www.mckenna.se/v2.png]] We have since gained a \"T.C.D.\", referring
    to the college, on request from the editor. I've also lowered the swash on the
    M, lowered the tittle, and the first lowercase l.\r\n\r\nGrateful for any other
    pointers! "
