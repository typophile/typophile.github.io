body: When inserting a drop cap, should the top of the character align with the baseline,
  x-height, or cap-height of the first line in the paragraph?

    that utilizes ahellafalotta ascenders, or many accents (or both!) maybe higher
    than x-height (which is what I would normally aim at as a starting point). In
    short: Utilize eyes and critical observation ;-)\r\n\r\nK"

  body: The typographic solution to this question is to start the paragraph with two
    or three words set in caps or small caps, and align the top of the drop cap with
    the top of those words.
