  it's not really that new (it's from 2004) which makes me wonder why I hadn't heard
  anybody mention it before. One of my students brought it to class the other day,
  and it's really a great collection of type design efforts - plus it's very well-produced.
  A definite Buy Recommendation.\r\n\r\nJust for reference - not a plug for Amazon:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3899550560/ref=sr_11_1/104-2497787-2534339?%5Fencoding=UTF8\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: It is, indeed, an excellent documentation of many experimental type projects.
    I recommend it to all the young designers in my department.

    and not die-cut) cover not sure about the contents, there are some minor translation
    errors in the 2004 edition, but not significant enough to interfere with reading
    it. Love the mould font experiment.\r\nTim"
