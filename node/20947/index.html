  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi typophiles,</p>
<p>due to working on a pitch for a consumer brand in the broad field of media, I am attempting to create a characteristic and legible wordmark. Based on the letter forms of an old logo of mine I am tweaking on new letters for the new wordmark.</p>
<p>The project is confidental, so unfortunately I can only show the second part of the wordmark, a sort of &ldquo;ad-on&rdquo; to the main-brand: &ldquo;Media&rdquo;. )</p>
<p>In the (selfish ;) prospect of someday completing a typeface I&rsquo;m considering the new letters to match somehow with the old logo letters&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your advice!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems reasonable in a way but I don&rsquo;t love the M. All the other letters share characteristics but your M is kind of a one-off. It doesn&rsquo;t share the mind-set of the other letters - just the line thickness.  It has weight distribution problems too but since I don&rsquo;t think you should keep the form I won&rsquo;t get into that. I would also consider (maybe) adding a tail/s to the &lsquo;i&rsquo;.  You can see them on Trebuchet ( one tail on top) , monoco ( two ) , or platelet (one on the bottom). If time is an issue you could ask a typophile to make you an M &amp; maybe an &ldquo;i&rdquo; too. If not, keep posting ideas &amp; we will critique them.</div>

already applying your suggestions… 
I&rsquo;m not so sure about the tail of the &ldquo;i&rdquo;,  but I didn&rsquo;t feel too comfortable with the &ldquo;M&rdquo; either. It&rsquo;s really far away from the previous shapes.
Still tweaking the &ldquo;M&rdquo;, it still looks a bit forced and lacks some elegance.
Your thoughts are appreciated.</p>

<p>I would also look for more differentiation of the e and a. If the final mark involves an s I would amend the line modularity to take it away from the vertical and add it to the diagonal.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Getting better. Here is what I would try now:</p>
<p>M: look at the bends at the top &amp; examine how there are handeled in the e next to it. Do you see how the bends are thicker/stronger? I suggest you emulate that. Look at the middle of the where the two sides join. The two parts comming down need to be stronger too. BUT you also need to consider the dip. After you have made the two middle parts stronger you may need to make thge cut slightly deeper. Let your eye guide your decision. I agree with Tiff that the bowing feet of the M also need to be addressed. I see at least 3 ways to potentially handle it. One way would be to make the come straight down. Try that 1st. It&rsquo;s easiest. You also might c onsider making the middle foot shorter to echo shorter upper &amp; lower arms of the e &amp; a. You might also consider taking the tail of the i you have, reversing it left to right &amp; using it on the left foot of the m. I think TIFF is also correct about the width. It could be a bit wider too.</p>
<p>i: You can try several things with this too. You could let the I come straight down. You could also modify the tail so that the shape isn&rsquo;t a litteral echo of the other letter shapes. You could flatter the curve a bit or just make it shorter or both. You could experiment with cutting it vertically vs. on a digonal. Other ideas are possible too. Do you see the illusion Tiff is talking about? You need to see it to correct for it.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

After having a worthwile look at eurostile and your suggestions I tried harder on the &ldquo;m&rdquo;.
Unfortunately due to another project my time on this logo was dramatically cut so I have very little time to finish this logo pitch, namely next monday.
In the long run, introducing more diagonal shapes is a valid point and seems quite necessary.
First variation of the &ldquo;m&rdquo; has straight feet, while I tried to apply some subtle bow on the others.
Still tweaking on some curves&hellip;

		<div class="commentbody">Looking at the r in sero I don&rsquo;t think that the down stroke on the d should extend or the the beginning stroke on the m extend so high either. The last one seems to fit with the &lsquo;sero&rsquo; the best. And it seems to be nearly there. Since it is just a pitch not final art you are probably at a good enough sort of stopping point. Good luck with the pitch. Did you ever try a shorter middle leg on the m?</div>
