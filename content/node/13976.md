  body: "FontShop is like the name says at first a SHOP. Over the past they have expanded
    their portfolio selling stock photos, books and other goodies like FontShop Germany.
    So, someone could think, they partly lost their focus on type. Others say they
    had a different focus all the time. This is the reason for some serious designers
    and foundries to avoid FontShop as valuable distributer. In fact, FontShop would
    be a very valuable distributer. They dont like the shopping flair, they dont want
    to be a needle in heap of hay.\r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\" target=\"_blank\">astype.de</a>--"

    the sale of stock photography, with custom imagery not be 'unethical?' :)

    both stock imagery and fonts (including some of your own) in a similar manner? '
