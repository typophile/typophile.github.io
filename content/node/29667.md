  currently working as an inhouse designer for greentube and I've already established
  myself as a graphic designer within the firm. \r\n\r\nbut the thing that's always
  been a thorn in my side is the logo.. Personally I think already a modernization
  would do enough. I think the bauhaus font is just outdated..\r\nBut how can I convince
  my boss to give me the permission to work on it?\r\nany ideas?\r\n\r\ncheers mike"

    with something he cant say no to. Seems easy enough.

  body: "I agree with the previous thoughts... I think you have to create a vastly
    improved logo and present it to them. The key is to show it in situ, so show how
    it would look on the company's website, stationery etc., so it's a straightforward
    comparison that you can sit side-by-side the existing brand, and they don't have
    to imagine how it would look when applied to things. Not everyone is good at visualising
    how things will look, it's much easier for many people to see how it actually
    looks.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    might not want to leave the company name in that orginal post.'

  body: "I've had experience in selling ideas to senior management, if not in graphic
    design specifically, and the key is to make them \"contribute\" to the solution.
    If you just give them a bunch of options and ask them to pick one, they'll reject
    all of them.\r\n\r\nWhat I do is present three options and make what seems to
    be an unbiased presentation of each: one that they can turn down flat, one that
    is \"close but needs their input,\" and the one I really want. The one I really
    want I say is the ideal solution but costs too much, takes too long, is too radical,
    or whatever. The idea is that the executive will pick up ideas from the preferred
    solution (since executives typically don't like to hear that something can't be
    done) and transfer them to the \"close but needs work\" solution. That way, the
    executive feels involved and as if they've been particularly bright.\r\n\r\n(Later
    edit: The first option, the one they can turn down flat, is critical here. Executives
    like to disapprove stuff.) \r\n\r\nThen you go away to \"incorporate\" their suggestions,
    and the result -- amazingly enough -- is close to what you wanted in the first
    place, but with just enough variation to make the executive think they had something
    to do with it. In the second presentation, you spin the result as showing the
    executive's keen insight and valuable contributions: \"Pat, your input was really
    valuable, and led us to look at things in a new way that gave us unexpected results,
    lowered cost, and shortened the time-to-design  dramatically.\" And since they've
    already seen your preferred solution, it won't be a shock to them when they see
    it again. But it's absolutely critical that it looks like they had some input
    to it; they can't easily reject something they've touched.\r\n\r\nThis is very
    cynical, I know, but it works.\r\n\r\n(Even later second edit: re getting permission,
    don't bother; just come up with the three options on your own. It shows initiative,
    and remember the cliche about forgiveness being easier to obtain than permission.
    If you think the CEO might accuse you of wasting company time working on a non-approved
    project, say you did it on your own time because you felt so strongly about it.)"

    body: " > Although it doesn\u2019t sound very Army. ;-)\r\n\r\nUh-oh. You read
      my comments in the MI poster thread. I hope it was clear that although irritated,
      I was still trying to make useful suggestions. Actually, there is something
      similar in the Army. I was an NCO; officers only think they run the place. We
      called it managing (or training) your officer.\r\n\r\nNot that I\u2019m trying
      to turn mikeb7 into a corporate Machiavelli, but there are some office politics
      that I thought of over the Thanksgiving holiday. (People who aren't corporate
      employees, feel free to roll your eyes in despair.)\r\n\r\n1. Don\u2019t spring
      the idea of a new logo on the CEO without preparing the ground first. If you
      surprise the CEO, the result is likely to be a corporate committee and you frozen
      out of the process.\r\n\r\n2. Find out if the CEO is personally invested in
      the current logo. For instance, if they\u2019re the corporate founder and the
      logo has been with the company since day one, or if the CEO designed the logo.\r\n\r\n3.
      If there are any middle managers between you and the CEO, they will need to
      be appeased. Some might just have to be kept in the loop, others may feel they
      need to approve the designs before the CEO sees anything. Unfortunately, middle
      managers vary too much for me to offer any one formula.\r\n"
