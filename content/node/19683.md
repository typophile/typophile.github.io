  times and never really introduced myself. My name is Joseph and Im a typoholic.
  I am a graphic designer from NYC, and have loved letters most of my life. Even in
  grade school my only A on my report card was in penmenship. It hasn't been untill
  recentley have I really focused my attention into the development of type, and have
  started to try and develop my own fonts. I started out drawing letters were they
  were always trying to be different, but not different were I would be actually breaking
  the rules, but by doing what I wanted without really knowing the rules. So from
  here I read, and I read, and I read everything I could get my hands on about type.
  Then I decided to start simpe, learn the rules and eventually I will be able to
  go back were I started. And that is what I wanted to do with this font. Right now
  it is only an uppercase font, and eventually I think I would like to add a small
  caps.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think. I would greatly appreciate your
  thoughts.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\njoseph"

    the top of the 2; it looks short."

    the left doesn't feel round, as O,Q, C seem to be based on perfect circles (if
    that is what you want)\r\nM needs work on the ankles, feels to fat/dark there,
    N too.\r\nS: top too small compared to bottom.\r\nU: too wide\r\n\r\n2,6,9: look
    too constructed compared with the rest, i'd round the joints  of the straight
    stroke with the circles in 6 and 9 more.\r\n7: horizontal stroke too wide\r\n0
    (Zero) feels too wide compared to your other numerals - or try to make it more
    oval.\r\n\r\nAll in my humble opinion of course.\r\n"

    of the other slanted strokes it seems odd to have a flat base to this.\r\n\r\nBut
    a very nice font."

      seems too wide to my eyes, and awkward where the curve meets the straight. '

  body: "Thank you everyone for your comments. I am going to work on it and hopefully
    have something up this weekend. \r\n\r\nDon, I am curious you say that the M should
    have a pointed vertex because it would work with the other slanted strokes. I'm
    not sure what that means. Is it because my slanted strokes do not rest on the
    baseline like my A or K? Would you have the tops of the M pointed as well like
    a futura M. Just want to make sure I fully understand.\r\n\r\nthanks again!\r\n\r\njoseph\r\n"
