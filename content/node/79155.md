  font which includes Cyrillic characters.\r\nHaving a good level of readability at
  smaller sizes would also be a bonus (allowing for longer strings within limited
  title space \u2014\_hence condensed).\r\n\r\nExamples of what I mean by 'nice/good/usable'\u2026\r\nNothing
  too scrawly. No classic/classical scripts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/dalton_maag/verveine_corporate_regular_ot/\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=151003\r\nhttp://typekit.com/fonts/ff-market-web\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/suomi_type_foundry/suomi_hand_script_ot/\r\n\r\n^^
  Suomi Hand Script would be a great choice if it had Cyrillics chars.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks for any recommendations y'all can share."

  body: "Thanks, folks.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of options in the Paratype and
    Tipomet selections that would fit the bill.\r\n\r\nThe Da Vinci and AndrijScript
    were both a bit too historical looking to suit.\r\n\r\nI've got client sign-off
    on Verveine \u2014\_which suits the 'looseness' of the brand \u2014\_but might
    hold off until I've had a proper look through the Paratype and Tipomet selections
    first.\r\n\r\nThanks, again.\r\n"
