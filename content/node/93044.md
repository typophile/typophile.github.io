body: Is anyone else having issues with the latest version of Glyphs crashing constantly?
  I've tried all the usual fixes. This is the version downloaded from the App store.

    link for an email address), if possibly with a more detailed problem description
    (like what did you do before it crashed).

  body: Thanks. I have posted in the Glyphs forum and contacted Georg directly. He
    says he is working on it, but in the meantime, I'm left with an unusable application.
    Just wondered if anyone else was having the same problems and maybe had figured
    out a workaround.

  body: "It can help in these cases to have multiple operating systems on your system,
    so that if something does not work on a particular system, you can try another
    one. Personally I prefer virtual systems under <em>VMware Fusion</em>, <em>Parallels
    Desktop</em>, and <em>VirtualBox</em>. Virtual systems provide an easy way to
    run different (versions of) operating systems for speci\uFB01c tasks and, of course,
    for testing. If a system is compromised, one throws it away and makes a copy of
    a clean basis again for further development. The server versions of Mac OS X work
    \uFB01ne under forenamed applications, as do Linux distros and Windows versions.\r\n\r\nAnother
    option is to add an external 1TB hard disk, to make for instance four partitions
    on it, and to install an OS X version on one of the partitions. A program like
    <em>SuperDuper</em> can be used then to make a bit-for-bit copy from the clean
    base version on the other partitions for speci\uFB01c tasks. You can select a
    partition as start-up disk then. If a partition is compromised, the clean basis
    can be copied to it again. As far as I know, this is allowed by the OS X EULA.
    \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be a bit careful with
    running applications from other partitions though, because I encountered problems
    with some frameworks in the past.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I never underst00d why
    people per se want to update their systems to the latest version. If things work
    \uFB01ne, leave them as they are. If there is speci\uFB01c stuff only available
    for a new operating system, install it for instance on an external drive, like
    described above. If one buys new hardware and one\u2019s work\uFB02ow functions
    \uFB01ne on the older system, keep the older system besides the new one. If an
    older app is not up-to-date anymore for speci\uFB01c tasks, look for a program
    that can add this functionality to the work\uFB02ow. If there is older software
    running faultlessly on older hardware, buy this hardware second-hand, because
    it doesn\u2019t cost much. There is no tax on the number of computers one owns
    (not yet, that is), you know.\r\n\r\nCommunications between older and newer systems
    can sometimes ask for some inventive solutions though, especially when support
    for older protocols like AppleTalk is dumped.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

    Apple approves it. That\u2019s why I suggest buying Glyphs directly from Georg.
    Send him an e-mail, explain your woes and ask him if you can crossgrade for free
    to a regular (i.e. non-AppStore) license.\r\n\r\nAbout the crashes: Weird. I haven't
    had such problems. Tried deleting the preferences or running it in a different
    user?"

  body: "blokland \u2014 I generally avoid upgrading unless I absolutely have to,
    especially if I have a stable workflow figured out. It's my own fault that I upgraded
    Glyphs without waiting to see if anyone had issues with the latest version, but
    it's a relatively new application with a small user base. Next time I will ask
    first.\r\n\r\nmekka \u2014 I might end up going that route. Plus I'd rather support
    developers directly. I did delete the preferences. In fact, I deleted everything
    Glyphs related and reinstalled from scratch. I'm still wondering if updating the
    application to 64-bit is for some reason causing problems for me. I'm on an old(er)
    iMac but the specs should be supported. I'll try setting up another user account
    to see if that helps. Thanks."

  body: In case anyone is following this, I restored the previous version of Glyphs
    (1.2.2) and so far it's stable. So at this point everything's pointing to an issue
    with the latest update.

    btw.
