  body: I think that is a custom lettered sign (and badly done at that). I also think
    it is obviously inspired by New Aster...with maybe a slight touch of Melior thrown
    in for good measure.

  body: Nope, not inspired by <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.120956.0.5&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=ABCNEWS&sampleSize=48">New
    Aster</a> -- too many discrepancies (C, N & W). Definitely based on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.125974.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=ABCNEWS&sampleSize=48">Plantin
    Bold</a>. Both Rainer and Nick were correct.
