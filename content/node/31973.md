body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis post is just to ask your opinions on a connundrum I'm currently
  facing.\r\n\r\nThe logo for my company is all lowercase (see it here - http://www.naturalstudio.co.uk)
  and I'm having a bit of a hard time deciding how it should be represented in a normal
  body of text.\r\n\r\n1. naturalstudio\r\n2. NaturalStudio\r\n3. Natural Studio\r\n\r\nI
  am keen for it to be one word (to try and maintain some sort of branding), but the
  first one poses certain problems. For the past year or so, I have used the first
  option (naturalstudio) exclusively. However, it is very context dependent - unless
  someone is already familiar with the name of the company, because of the lack of
  capitalisation, it might simply look like someone has ommited a space.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  it looks a bit clumsy when placed first in a sentence:\r\n\r\nAs you see, it seems
  quite unatural. naturalstudio doesn't seem to work in this instance.\r\n\r\nWhich
  leaves NaturalStudio. At least it has \"a look\" about it. However, I think it may
  be a bit tacky. What do you all reckon?\r\n\r\nThe last option is Natural Studio,
  but somehow that just looks a bit uninspiring to me. Also, there is no branding
  there at all - just two separate, commonly used words.\r\n\r\nTo put a spanner in
  the works, the record label division of the company is usually on album artwork
  as naturalstudio records (i.e all lowercase). But how should it be cited in text
  - naturalstudio records? NaturalStudio Records? Natural Studio Records?\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your thoughts.\r\n\r\nDouglas."

    go with consistency above all else, so I'd recommend using \"naturalstudio\" since
    you seem to largely employ that elsewhere. A number of people are opposed to innercaps
    like \"NaturalStudio\" (which is apparently why it's \"Photoshop\" and not \"PhotoShop\"
    -- one certainly looks classier than the other)."

  body: "CamelCase - I didn't know it had a name. When I first started the company
    in 1999 I used to use NaturalStudio almost exclusively, but I think it looks really
    dated now.\r\n\r\n<cite>A common device is to format the company\u2019s name in

    but I guess you can't expect everyone to do that. For example, if a naturalstudio
    release was reviewed in the press, it's unlikely they'd use a specified colour,
    font or weight.\r\n\r\nSmallcaps doesn't quite work for me. Somehow it looks less
    creative. Also, I think the mix of smallcaps and lowercase doesn't quite work.
    And again, I expect not everyone would do it.\r\n\r\n<cite>There is a fourth option
    that I think you should consider: Naturalstudio (and Naturalstudio Records).</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    had considered this, but just thought it seemed a bit front-heavy. A bit imbalanced?\r\n\r\nThe
    most important thing for me is consistency. Wherever the name \"naturalstudio\"
    appears (except the logo), I would like it to have the same format. I guess the
    only thing that I can expect all press/publishers to print is Naturalstudio or
    Natural Studio, right? At the moment, I reckon Naturalstudio & Naturalstudio Records
    comes out on top...\r\n\r\n(It makes me realise what a touch of genius Apple's
    \"iPod\" idea was. It looks good in almost any font and has it's own branding.)"

    but I understand what you mean.) However, balance is not that much of a concern
    unless it's in the context of a logo. Your logo is going to be all-lowercase regardless,
    so no problem there."

  body: "OK.\r\n\r\nSo, it's definitely now between Naturalstudio and Natural Studio.\r\n\r\nThere
    are many companies with the conjoined word plus initial capital approach - just
    looking around my house I can see Microsoft, Hotpoint, Silentnight, Airfix, Bodyform
    etc.. The good thing with this approach is that if you do a search in Google,
    you'll probably get what you're looking for - all the results are almost exlusively
    relating to my company.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think my current logo suggest two different
    words. Although they are conjoined, the difference in weight reads as natural
    studio. All the above mentioned companies use one font and one weight for their
    logos - hence the reason that is remains one word whenever mentioned in copy.
    I can't imagine my logo changing as it is already well established. If I did modify
    it, the essence of it would have to remain the same.\r\n\r\nThe main down side
    of Natural Studio is that unless you put the words in inverted commas when doing
    a Google search there are thousands of unrelated links.\r\n\r\nOther than the
    Google issue - does anyone else have any negative thoughts about \"Natural Studio\".
    For some reason, it just seems cumbersome to me. Maybe because all my favourite
    company names are either one word...?\r\n\r\nCurious to hear your further thoughts.\r\n\r\nDouglas."

  body: "Interesting discussion.  I too have been frustrated by the criticism of our
    company name \"v\xE4samed\".  Despite its stylized appearance in formal documents
    (see website www.vasamed.com) the matter of dealing with the lack of the expected
    cap \"V\" in day-to-day correspondence has been \"educational\" to put it in as
    positive a manner as possible.  Frequently heard comments: What does it mean?
    \ Why do you not capitalize the name?  What are the funny dots?\"  On and on.
    \ One benefit I suppose is that these questions and comments equal attention and
    an opportunity for our team to engage in discussions with customers.  The fact
    that we are a medical company seems to create an urgent need on the part of our
    customer audience to want grammar and behavior conformance e.g. VasaMed, Vasamed,
    Vasa Medical, etc. As I said, we have grown to welcome most of the attention since
    it provides an opportunity to engage customers in a philosophical discussion of
    our name, its meaning and relevance to our product lines and tie to strategic
    mission.  Most of the time, they get it and like it so much that they advocate
    keeping it just the way it is. It's fun to hear some of them get into the artistic
    aspect of it and link it to their medical missions in life.  However none of the
    finance/audit types like our name, the lower case, the umlaut and insist it be
    changed to something \"meaningful and conventional\". This continues to be a challenge
    for us.    \r\n   "
