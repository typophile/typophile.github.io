In the spirit of not wandering aimlessly, my goal is to make a font with which I can set papers for my college courses.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the moment, I've completed the lower and upper case basic alphabet.

Any ideas for improvement?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I may be overlooking far larger problems here. If so, please set me straight!

		<div class="commentbody">Actually I think your spacing is in fact too tight overall. However: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. It seems that some areas (like the &quot;ven&quot; sequence) are fine, and in fact some are too loose - so it's still too uneven to tell. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. There's no easy way to be sure anyway without a physical printout in the intended medium  - probably through lino, right? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;s&quot; is in fact too dark - because of its density it always has to be lighter than you think. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Is it normal to have 26x26 kerning pairs to make all upper case text look alright? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No, although I happen to think it's a great idea to use such an exhaustive matrix to loosen all-caps setting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your &quot;bdpq&quot;&hellip; it depends who you ask: some designers will say they are &quot;wrong&quot;. But I think they're more than fine. In fact, I've only seen such a wonderful &quot;d&quot; structure one other place - in my Patria&hellip; :-&gt;  But be careful of getting too attached to individual glyphs: taming overly flamboyant characters can be very painful but is usually necessary. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your main problem right now is the &quot;g&quot; (by far the most difficult character in Latin). Don't let dogma ruin it for you. Some otherwise wonderful designs (like Matrix) really need a much smarter &quot;g&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for your uppercase forms, what I might advise is something I hinted at in the thread about Avance: go orthodox. Those puppies are really gloriously stiff - it's all they got - let them shine in their own way. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, your comma is amazing!

		<div class="commentbody">I've been trying to figure out what I like so much about this  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->face. I've decided it's the clunkiness of the serifs combined  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with the overall inconsistency. It's really alive. I've long <!-- raw HTML omitted -->loved the clunkyness of slab serifs, but most are a little too  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mechanical for my liking&ndash; too perfect. This has more   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->vitality. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it looks great in the setting. I would polish a few   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->characters, but nothing to change the overall feel. And   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->don't even think about taming the k. If you really want to   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->make a font to set a book in, start over. If you want a really   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->funky cool something for small blocks of copy, you're right  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A few suggestions: The spur on the d and the q have got to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->go. They are awkward, and don't fit the other characters.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->They imply a line that doesn't line up with anything else.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The d could take a cue from the a. I would work on the   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->terminals on the S, the j and the y. The terminals on the C   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and the G are also a little awkward. The G feels a little   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->heavy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don't polish too much though.

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah! Booo to stressless zeroes, at least in this design. The logic of the shapes just doesn't want it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I do have a specific question. Does anyone else think the numerals are too wide? I keep going back and forth on this, which probably means that they are. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; The 3 looks excessively bitey. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What does bitey mean?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think of the stressless 0 as being a Gill-y feature, but that's based on gut feel rather than actual knowledge, so I'm probably out to lunch. If you're not going to use that, then I think you ought to make the 0 more ovoid. It really strongly resembles an oversized 'o' right now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think the numerals are too wide. I guess I am kind of curious why the 1's serif structure is different from the letters', though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Bitey&quot; means the way the two serifs close in on the middle of the 3 makes it look like it's biting itself. It's too closed in, I would say.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree that the figures are wide, and sometimes I think they look too big. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One way of solving it is by making the shorter. And smaller, in consequence. This typeface is narrow, so I guess it is appropriate to have narrow figures. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In general, I think that typefaces with low x-height are the ones that benefit more from having this kind of &quot;floating&quot; oldstyle figures (figures taller/higher than the x-height). But this is a typeface with a generous x-height, so I think the figures should be closer to the x-height. (But don't align them with the x-height! :-)</div>
