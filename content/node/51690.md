body: "I've recently bumped into a a question I don't have an answer for. This happens
  a lot. The difference is this time I don't even know where to look to for a solution.
  Since it has to do with setting type, I figured this was the place to go.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is Quebec. Aside from needing a French version of all of this signage, I
  need to set the Canadian Dollar sign differently. My understanding is that it should
  follow the amount with a space, and should technically have two slashes. Aside from
  that, I know nothing. \r\n\r\nIs it's placement as open to interpretation as the
  US dollar sign?   "

  body: "okay, I can't speak for european french on this one, but I do know canadian
    french numerals.\r\n\r\n<strong>canadian english uses a ',' as a delimiter between
    thousands:</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>fifty thousand would be written: 50,000\r\nfifty
    million would be written: 50,000,000</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>canadian french uses
    a ' ' as a delimiter between thousands.</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>cinquante mille would
    be: 50 000\r\ncinquante million would be: 50 000 000</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, also
    note that decimalization is different between english and french here too.\r\n\r\n<strong>canadian
    english uses '.' as a decimal point:</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>five point five would
    be: 5.5\r\nten point seven five would be: 10.75</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>canadian french
    uses a ',' as a decimal point:</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>cinq point cinq would be: 5,5\r\ndix
    point soixante-quinze would be: 10,75</em>\r\n\r\nI hope this clears up some of
    the number thing.  I can't say for sure for sure, but everywhere I look here in
    canada we set a price like this:\r\n\r\nfive dollars and fifty cents: $ 5.50\r\nand
    in the french: $ 5,50\r\n\r\nBest of luck,\r\ninnovati!"
