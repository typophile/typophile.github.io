  design process in creating a classic logo. \r\nMy client wants a logo in style of
  Hermes. \r\n\r\nHere is my moodboard so far. \r\nDo you have any extra ideas and
  of course fonts that would go well with a classic (1900 style) logo. \r\n\r\nThank
  you ! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inspi_5333.jpg]"

    and Extra Ideas ...you never know when you'll need an Idea. Best to be prepared
    with Extra Ideas ...good thing I've gots lots :) Not all good Extra Ideas tho.
    I guess it all depends on how one manages their Extra Ideas as to how effective
    they can be ...and become main Ideas!\r\n\r\nAnyways... back while ago now I snagged
    this link to a whole book of Extra Ideas ... it's not called that tho....\r\n\r\nhttp://archive.org/stream/1923AmericanTypeFoundersSpecimenBookCatalogue/1923ATFSpecimenBook#page/n0/mode/2up\r\n\r\n...they
    called it the 1923 American Type Founders Specimen Book Catalogue.\r\n\r\n...whatever.\r\n\r\nFor
    me the fun really starts around page 586 of the ...1923 American Type Founders
    Specimen Book of Extra Ideas ...beginning with a spiffy selection of Typographic
    Accessories.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      :p (I should learn how to google better ;) ) \r\n\r\nThanks for the replies
      guys, \r\n\r\nI think the font of \"the vintager\", displayed in my first post,
      is knockout, \r\nbut does anybody know how you \"curve\" the letters in a nice
      way like that ? \r\nNot just typed on a curving path? \r\n\r\nThanks !!! "

    Akzidenz-Grotesk BQ Medium Condensed is the font used for VINTAGER, but I don't
    know what the fonts are for the type on top and below VINTAGER.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/medium-condensed/\r\n\r\nAnd
    to achieve that text effect simply use... Effect > Warp > Arc Lower ...and enter
    a negative value.\r\n\r\nOops sorry, I guess it could be Knockout ..."
