  identity, tickets, brochures, posters, etc)\r\nThis is what I have so far. Please
  tell me what you think (please, please, be honest. I will appreciate anything you
  guys type and will make it better.)\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_6696.jpg]"

  body: "Heres my thoughts and process on re-designing this logo.\r\nFor the font
    I used Bodoni because I thought that such a wonderful, elegant font can be best
    used for a wonderful, oldschool ballet company.\r\nI chose the color red (well,
    the color is alittle off.. hmm) because it simply looks nice and goes with the
    image of what these ballet dancers were born to do; dance."

  body: "I like the new direction with the font style and color. I also appreciate
    your keeping it to a simple logotype. I would, however, suggest a slightly more
    delicate font \u2014 still maintaining the bodone look. I would go with something
    more like [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100004|didot]]
    Bold Roman (64 pt Master). The serifs contrast much more with the rest of the
    characters suggesting a much more delicate, beautiful feeling. I also like the
    way didot seemingly treats each character with more individual attention and grace.

  body: Penn, Actually I tried this logo in 10 different fonts, and yes, one of them
    was didot. Didot is a nice font, but in this case some of the sections of the
    font are just unreadable. I purposely chose Bodoni so that no matter how small
    this logo is going to be scaled to, it'll still be readable.

  body: What's the goal of the project? Right now it's just "Boston Ballet" written
    in another typeface, at least that's what I see as someone who knows nothing about
    Boston, the ballet, or the Boston Ballet. Their current logo isn't remarkable,
    but it's not terribly outdated,so it might be helpful for getting feedback if
    you elaborated on what your brief is for the project.

  body: "The current logo is delicate, graceful, airy... Your redesign, to me, seems
    bold, hard (maybe?), and tight. It seems little jarring. I walk by the Boston
    Ballet frequently and I cannot see your new logo etched on the windows or on an
    awning over the door.\r\n\r\nThe current logo says traditional & timeless...Bodoni,
    to me, says...90's, for lack of a better description. I know the typeface is from
    the late 18th century, but maybe it's the color. It just seems too outdated to
    me.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, I like the slight concave serif on the l's. They
    provide a subtle, graceful nuance.\r\n\r\nSorry if that seemed too critical, I
    didn't mean it to be. :("

    logo?

  body: "I think that all-caps or lc would suit this better. in title case it reads
    a bit like a print publication masthead. I also would recommend Bauer Bodoni,
    or a cut of bodoni with more curvaceous details. Your kern is nice, but loosen
    it to allow it to breathe more.\r\n\r\nI'd try some American fonts for cultural
    resonance:\r\nCentury expanded, Binny Old Style, Cheltenham, Fairfield, etc"

  body: "Ken, I agree with your choice to set the logotype with Upper-lover case letters
    (this is more consistent than all caps or small caps).\r\nBut I think Bodoni Is'nt
    a real \"dance\" typeface. Bodoni is synonimous of stability and statuesque.\r\nWhy
    not a classic italic serif typeface? (garamond?)\r\n\r\ncarlo"
