body: I've been hearing that glyphs are missing from the PDFs of <A href="http://typophile.com/node/28862">my
  font samples</a>. Does anybody have a clue as to what is going on, and/or how to
  fix it?

  body: The font has become more complete in the more recent iterations, so yes, some
    new glyphs were included. I seem to recall some change in my procedure at some
    point but I have forgotten what it was,
