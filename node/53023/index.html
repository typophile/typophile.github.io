		<div class="commentbody"><p>I generally rely on a baseline grid that is equal to the basal text leading (or sometimes one-half) and feel that this is usually a very useful reference to aid the underlying harmony in a complex design.</p>
<p>However, I <em>never</em> use the Align to Baseline feature. I feel this is far too Procrustean and makes it inconvenient to work with syncopated rhythms. When I&rsquo;m designing a book with many elements and many levels of text, simple ratios like 1:2 are not always enough.</p>
<p>I have other techniques that I&rsquo;ve developed for maintaining absolute precision with a baseline grid, while still offering plenty of flexibility.</p>
<p>I happen to think the Align to Baseline feature is superfluous, and in some cases enables sloppy work habits and lazy design thinking (not a personal criticism of anybody in particular, just my general opinion about the feature).</p>

<p>In many-paged documents, if I can, I like to use a baseline grid that is 1/2 or even 1/3 of my body leading. I try not to baseline-shift except for special cases like heads. Then I make sure to set leading, space-before, space-after, etc. to multiples of the grid increment.</p>

<p>Here is an experiment. Get a copy of <cite>Art of the Printed Book, 1455-1955</cite>, by Joseph Blumenthal (printed by Godine). Take whatever design manual you favor as having the best &ldquo;design rules,&rdquo; and go through the books Blumanthal has selected. Likely, according to the set of design rules you followed, most of the books are poorly designed and set. Yet most <cite>are</cite> works of art, and belong. In fact, they are still fairly easy for a modern audience to read, assuming you know the language. Why is that?</p>
<p>Long texts are to be read. That is the designer/compositor&rsquo;s primary job, facilitating reading. Snapping copy to a baseline grid doesn&rsquo;t much facilitate this, in spite of what some might tell you. Pleasing spatial arrangements are more complex.</p>

However, I have received files from designers who do use the feature. But as I have worked with these files, I have seen the designers have also used what pica pusher has called &ldquo;<em>good</em> design habits like carefully considering space between paragraphs and heads, or paying attention to horizontal alignments between columns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If one does pay this close attention to detail, there should be no need to use the snap to grid. Perhaps the designers used the snap as insurance.</p>
<p>RE Charles' comment about the Blumenthal book: I&rsquo;m the guy who did the page composition on that book. I know that if one examined Blumenthal&rsquo;s book as well as the books discussed therein, one would find plenty of divergence from the book&rsquo;s supposed grid. I had to do that to get things to fit and to look good. I did try to start all the shoulder heads on the baseline of the adjacent text. One of the most valuable tricks I learned as an apprentice comp was how and when to &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; certain spacings in order to achieve other pleasing spatial arrangements. This lesson came not from a design classroom nor from a textbook, but from a skilled journeyman.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite> &gt; Kent, can you be more specific as to which sloppy work habits you’re referring to? </cite></p>
<p>To clarify: It&rsquo;s the use of the Align to Baseline Grid feature (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;sticky baseline&rdquo; or &ldquo;snap to baseline&rdquo;) that I think leads to sloppy work habits &ndash; an inattentive designer can end up with several elements all specified with a mish-mash of leadings, paying no attention to relationships, and then all of them will magically snap to a grid: the results may look clean, but the work habits are sloppy.</p>
<p>(Believe me, I&rsquo;ve had to come in and revise documents done this way &ndash; you can&rsquo;t trust the readout of leading values, because the program isn&rsquo;t using them if it&rsquo;s snapping to a grid; the stylesheets are usually a mess, because there&rsquo;s little consequence to overriding everything, or no motivation to update and clean them up, etc.)</p>
<p>As you say, working with a baseline grid (but not necessarily &ldquo;snapping&rdquo; everything to it automatically) can encourage more attentive design, by highlighting alignments and relationships. To be clear: it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;snapping&rdquo; feature that I find problematic.</p>
<p>With regard to my &ldquo;lazy design thinking&rdquo; comment, this goes along with what Charles was getting at. Over-reliance on a baseline grid (especially &ldquo;snap to&rdquo;) promotes a cookie-cutter approach.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you have to turn the grid off and use your eyes. Just because it&rsquo;s on the grid, doesn&rsquo;t make it right.</p>
<p>As Charles so eloquently put it, &ldquo;pleasing spatial arrangements are more complex.&rdquo; I like that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ditto Kent&rsquo;s comments on the snapping feature. I always respecify the baseline grid to the text leading I&rsquo;m using for a book, but it is just there to aid the eye. With InDesign, I spend at least half the time working with it turned off.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can sum it up this way: It is a tool, and like any tool, under some circumstances can aid (speed) production, but used without thought, can &ldquo;foul&rdquo; [things] up beyond all repair.</p>
<p>Fair enough?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I used the music/rythm paralell in an earlier post on the same topic. I think it is relevant here as well: Music composed on a computer, with every detail snapped to the &ldquo;rythm grid&rdquo; gives a robotic, mechanical and cold impression. The human factor – a little unperfection –  makes for a much more lively composition.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I use Align to Baseline Grid 9 out of 10 times. Mostly to make sure that lines align on two opposite pages, and don&rsquo;t shift for whatever reason. But it depends on what kind of project I&rsquo;m working on. I design alot of poetrybooks, and for those Align to Baseline Grid is ideal.</div>
