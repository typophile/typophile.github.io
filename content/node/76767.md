    to different point sizes. Since the advent of PostScript and scalable font technology,
    point specific designs have disappeared from the realm of typography.\r\n\r\nGoHebrew
    is reviving point specific designs. Here is an example of GHB Lino-Nine. GH stands
    for GoHebrew. B stands for Biblical Hebrew: dagesh, nikud, meteg, and taam. Nine
    is for nine points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ruth -

    by the now defunct Varityper corporation, makers of expensive mini-computer based
    phototypesetting equipment. Typefaces were held on discs, and projected by a lens-attached

  body: "Frank-Reuhl is a composite name of two people: Frank, the type designer,
    and Reuhl, the punch-cutter (the one who implemented the design into metal type,
    by cutting the metal into a punch - a skill no longer needed or even known how
    to do well. Often, the talented punch-cutter modified the design a little, so
    the type would print better.\r\n\r\nFrank-Reuhl had different names given to it
    by different vendors. Today, we have many different designs of Frank-Reuhl. To
    make referring to them, I have slightly modified their spelling to correctly identify
    them all.\r\n\r\nIf you look in a different blog in this section, you will examples
    of Mr. Frank's original design. I implemented it in the 1987 in PostScript Type
    3, but can not find it. Most Frank-Reuhl designs come from the fifties, sixties,
    or seventies.\r\n\r\nLinotype did the most innovative work about forty years ago,
    by creating size specific versions of Frank-Reuhl (and Times-Roman), I believe
    by Matthew Carter, the great type designer."

  body: "This why I am confused. The name of the punch cutter was Carl Friedrich R\xFChl
    - so to avoid the umlaut, we would write Carl Friedrich Ruehl and the complete
    name of the company was \xBBC. R\xFChls Schrift- und Stereotypen-Gie\xDFerei,
    Stempelschneiderei, Xylographie und Galvanoplastik\xAB (impressing, isn't it?).
    \r\nSo Reuhl makes no sense... The punch cutter also made some other typefaces...
    \r\n\r\nBut, by the way. The font is written \u05E4\u05E8\u05E0\u05E7-\u05E8\u05D9\u05D4\u05DC
    in hebrew, it should be \u05E4\u05E8\u05E0\u05E7-\u05E8\u05D5\u05D9\u05DC(Reuhl)
    otherwise ;-)\r\n\r\nSo, I had the impression, it is called Frank-Reuhl to avoid
    any legal issues."

  body: "There are no legal issues according to secular laws anywhere.\r\n\r\nI used
    to spell the Reuhl part with the 'u' before the 'e' years ago, but most people
    had a pronunciation problem with Ruehl, making the 'h' too distinguished, as 'rue-hl'
    versus 'reuh-l'. Plus, others spelled it 'Reuhl'. So, I conformed.\r\n\r\nI would
    like to see Carl Friedrich Ruehl's typefaces.\r\n\r\nIn truth, today the punch-cutter
    contribution is meaningless. We keep Carl Friedrich Ruehl's name for history's
    sake.\r\n\r\nDo you have Frank (or Fronk)'s drawings before Ruehl created type
    from them?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe logo is very good. The eye sees it, and identifies
    the person with the blog post quickly. It was just difficult at first to put two
    and two together, as we say. Likely, I will from now on."

    the FrankReuhl design for special use for a Varityper photo-typesetting machine
    or an earlier non-Linotype machine. This version of Linotype Frankrul was fascinating,
    because it combined many of the features and nuances of the three Linotype designs
    into one design.\r\n\r\nI digitized that in 1989. I haven't found this yet, though
    my customer has it.\r\n\r\nNotice that the left side bottom, leg of the Aleph
    is lifted up a bit by the bottom of the heel. This was a master type design, for
    it cause the eye of the reader to advance. This is known as good eye movement."

    point type, photo-enlarged about x 15 +/-.\r\n\r\nBut the melted chocolate was
    not that thick.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the designer was that the descending element
    was similar to the thick horizontal bar of many other letters, such as the samech
    and the peh.\r\n\r\nThe thickness, more than the thickness of the horizontal bar
    of other letter may be attributed to ink spread."
