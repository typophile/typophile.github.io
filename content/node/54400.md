  shed some light on this subject. I would greatly appreciate it. It may only be sign
  making programs that do not accept positive kerning.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-Charles\r\n\r\nwww.borgeslettering.com"

    I would be greatly surprised if they still did. Maybe one or two still are around,
    and if so, I'd consider such behavior a bug. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"

  body: 'I have never encountered a program that didn''t support positive kerning
    if it supported kerning at all. Positive kerning has been used in many early T1
    fonts. Monotype''s Bembo and Bell are examples, as well as all the Berthold PS
    fonts. Berthold fonts are unusable without kerning because the Berthold spacing
    system depends on positive kerns between all possible o-o shape strings. '
