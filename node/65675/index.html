  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The font "Helvetica Neue 75 Bold Outline" sold by Adobe is faulty.

More than two dozen glyphs are NOT online, but solid black:

see www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/Helvetica-75-outline.jpg

This is highly interesting, because the seemlingly same outline font sold by Linotype does NOT have these faults.

This means that (at least some of the) seemingly identical fonts sold both by Adobe and Linotype are NOT identical, so that it make a difference from where you get them.

Oh yeah!

I did some digging: Adobe's 1991 outline version was lacking numerous glyphs. Later Adobe inserted bold solid glyphs instead of bold outline glyphs to complement the missing glyphs, whereas Linotype inserted outline glyphs.

The entire font family "Neue Helvetica", publicized in a 1984 Linotype catalog, is now public domain. This includes the outline style too, which also appeared 25 years ago.</div>

It is true, that fonts with the same names, that come from Adobe, Linotype, Monotype and ITC are not necessarily the same.

ITC Galliard Std sold by Adobe, does not contain old style figures, superiors, inferiors and more. ITC Galliard Std sold by ITC does contain these characters.

Except from that there can be big differences in the quality of the hinting, dependent from where you buy the fonts. Linotype does not care as much as Adobe about hinting. The appearance on screen can be big, dependent from where you buy the fonts.

So, if you want to buy a font, that is available from two or more foundries, you have to compare them, although the fonts have exactly the same name.

Read www.linotype.com/1823/neuehelvetica.html

"In 1983, D. Stempel AG redesigned and digitized the "Neue Helvetica™" typeface for Linotype and made it a self-contained font family."

The 25-year protection period elapsed, and Helvetica entered public domain.

That is correct for all fonts of German foundries, such as the "Neue Helvetica" made by the defunct German Stempel AG in 1984.

"Neue Helvetica" belongs to the 400 additional Linotype fonts which will enter the public domain in 5 days, as of January 1st, 2010. For all the other additional fonts which will fall into PD in a few days, please see the brand-new additional document:
 
www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/publicdomain2.pdf

For legal details please read the main document:

		<div class="commentbody">If Uli is actually correct about this it will be huge boon to the Open Source font movement (assuming they can actually find copies of the original font files). Sure they’ll have to change the trademarked names, but that never stopped anyone. Getting people to design complex families for free is pretty tough, but I doubt they’ll have a hard time getting some people to convert these to bring the old files into Fontforge, expand the character sets to cover the entire range of Latin characters, and generate new OT fonts. Once the procedure is in place a small team could just keep banging them out. It will takes years to get through them all, but it will happen.</div>

That’s one you’ll have to take up with the lawyers. There are going to be a lot of ugly international copyright law overlaps to work out between individual European nations, the EU, and the USA. I suspect that we’ll see safe haven web sites set up in the countries where people have ensured that the fonts are clear for free redistribution until they’re completely public domain everywhere. That’s how this usually works with software/algorithm patents.</div>

That's similar to how it works on [[http://www.classicalmusicmobile.com|Classical Music Mobile]], a website with a banner that states, "Legal Music Only." The site offers MP3s taken from sound recordings that are out of copyright. The files are not free, but the usual price is only €1 per work, regardless of length. The following explanation appears on the website: "Internationally, sound recordings are protected for 50 years from the end of the year in which they were first released (in the USA, the legislation depends on the States). That means, any recording published or released to the public before 1959 is now out of copyright, i.e. in the public domain."</div>

The Hoefler & Frere-Jones outfit made a ripoff clone of the public domain font "Clarendon" in the year 2009:

see www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/sentinel-1.jpg

This was legal, because everyone is allowed to rip off public domain fonts.

But the Hoefler & Frere-Jones ripoff outfit was not allowed in the year 2009 to register this "Clarendon" ripoff clone under the font name "Sentinel", because a font with the same font name "Sentinel" is in use since the year 2000/2001 and hence has name priority:

The blurb runs as follows:

<cite>"<strong>Hoefler-Frere-Jones</strong> was designed to address the many shortcomings of Typographer Mediengestaltung's <strong>Sentinel</strong>. Unbound by traditions and by technologies that limit its design, or by ornamental details that restrict its range, <strong>Hoefler-Frere-Jones</strong> is a fresh take on this useful and lovely <strong>Sentinel</strong> style. From the Antique style it borrows a program of contrasting thicks and thins, but trades that style’s frumpier mannerisms for more attractive contemporary details. Planned from the outset to flourish in small sizes as well as large, <strong>Hoefler-Frere-Jones</strong> contains features that make it a dependable choice"</cite>
