  body: Pistilli Roman. Although it looks like it&#39;s been heavied up a bit with
    ink spread or some outline/shadow treatement. I&#39;ll post a scan shortly.

    a copy too -- too bad so much of the type isn&#39;t digitized&#41;. Good eye.

  body: I love my Phil&#39;s book too. I wonder if Ralph Smith and the gang at Phil&#39;s
    Fonts have access to any of that film. Seems a shame that so much of it hasn&#39;t
    made to it digital.

    the best samples, and it&#39;s fairly comprehensive as of  <BR>about 1980 for
    old film fonts. Other books have a broader  <BR>sampling, but poorer showings.

    and especially by Serif type. Very Handy. I have a Second Edition version with
    a $39.95  sticker still on the back. What do you mean that yours is #573?'

    my name written in and the number &#34;573/2500&#34; which  <BR>&#40;I assume&#41;
    means it&#39;s number 573 of a run of 2500. There&#39;s  <BR>also a coupon in
    the back to put the cost of the book  <BR>toward the first job I might send to
    them. I don&#39;t know if  <BR>you remember, but typesetters usually kept track
    of who  <BR>had their catalogs for marketing purposes. Those things  <BR>weren&#39;t
    cheap to produce, I&#39;m sure.

    published by Rockport Publishers in 1985. You have a collector&#39;s item to be

  body: Huh! I didn&#39;t realize it was published as a book. I always  <BR>assumed
    that everyone had a copy like mine. In addition to  <BR>the coupon and receipt
    in the back pocket, it also has a  <BR>credit application and price list. It&#39;s
    loose-bound in a  <BR>three-ring binder, so it&#39;s easy to take the pages out.
    The  <BR>three indexes in the front are saddle-stitched separately  <BR>and bound
    in with the other pages. A fairly elaborate  <BR>package, actually.

  body: The Phil&#39;s Photo &#34;Homage to the Alphabet&#34; is indeed a treasure.
    The first edition in a 3-ring binder is beautiful, and is definitely a collector&#39;s
    item. When I still worked at Phil&#39;s a couple of years go, they had a small
    stash left of the first edition. If I recall correctly, they were selling for
    around $150 each, and there may be a few copies left. Yes, it&#39;s more than
    the later paperback editions you can find second-hand, but the original is just
    wonderful. I highly recommend it as a Christmas gift &#40;to yourself&#41;. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>And no, I am no longer affiliated with Phil&#39;s Fonts in any way, I
    just want everyone to have the joy of owning this book if possible.

    what it is; the original must go back a fair way. Thanks again for your help.

  body: I don&#39;t know much about it, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s from any  <BR>earlier
    than the late 1960s. I can tell you that it was a VGC  <BR>font designed by John
    Pistilli and that it came in three basic  <BR>weights--normal, bold, and black.
    The weights appear to  <BR>refer mainly to the thickness of the hairlines, sort
    of like  <BR>optical scaling. There were two other styles--Open No. 1  <BR>and
    Open No. 2--which only differed in stroke thickness.

  body: Mark,  <BR>I just  found a site &#40;<a href="http://www.incipit.com/typefaces.html"
    target="_blank"> Incipit</a>&#41; that says they have a photocomposition &#40;film
    type&#41; library of 3,500 faces, including the 4 Pistilli faces. A quick glance
    at their type catalog listing shows a lot of the Phil&#39;s Photo typefaces alive
    and well in that collection. Makes you wish you had your own Typositor doesn&#39;t
    it?

    Fonts an e-mail and told me that they sold the last one about 3 years ago, <BR>thanksTamie
    for the clue though, and yes, that would have been the perfect gift. <BR> <BR>BTW

    of them. <BR> <BR>I actually have a dozen old Typositor reels with 60 or so <BR>faces
    on them. They used to belong to the University of  <BR>Minnesota&#39;s Journalism
    School. I grabbed them when they  <BR>were going to be thrown out. No Typositor,
    though. <BR> <BR>I wanted very badly for a while to have a Typositor in-house  <BR>when

    <BR> <BR>I just realized I&#39;ve been calling mine a &#34;three-ring binder,&#34;

    Phil&#39;s Photo. Very talanted guy. I&#39;ve been out of touch with him for years.  <BR>
    <BR>By the way the catalog ,&#34;Homage&#34;, is the first instance I can recall
    that has a &#34;found typography&#34; or what ever you want to call it. Photos
    of type in everyday use separate each alphabetical section.  <BR> <BR>

    which is from the giant letters for The Big Kitchen  <BR>which used to be at the
    top of one of the WTC towers. It  <BR>was designed by Milton Glaser and I always
    thought it was a  <BR>neat thing. I&#39;m sure it was long gone by the time of
    the  <BR>attacks, but seeing it now reminds me of everthing thing  <BR>that&#39;s
    happened since. You never know what you&#39;ll find in a  <BR>type specimen book.
