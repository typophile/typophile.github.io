  body: Yes in a TTF the kern table stores the kerning information. If it&#39;s &#39;green&#39;
    then it should be properly formed.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know about Flash or Corel
    Draw but in Word kerning is not applied by default you have to turn it on under
    font / character spacing. Even then on screen in the wysiwyg mode it might not
    be apparent as Word messes with the spacing to simulate the printed layout. <BR>
    <BR>Cheers, Si
