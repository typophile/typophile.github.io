  is a bold display face which emphasises legibility and clarity, but which combines
  those qualities with a distinctive flair.  The designs have a timeless quality,
  making them equally at home today or even in Victorian inspired design work.  All
  of the faces are ideal for poster work, signage or for really eye-catching but not
  ostentatious headings and titles.  Seven faces are offered combining upper and lower
  case forms with incised and embossed decoration as well as an italic form.\r\n\r\nHere
  is a specimen sheet showing all seven faces:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Doncaster_Gallery5_4462.png]"
