  I'm not sure but I thought the big pulsating collective Type brain that is typophile
  may be able to.\r\nThanks!\r\nJB[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Monogram.jpg]"

  body: "Was this taken from one of the Solo or Dover books? The monograms which I
    have seen from these books are all hand-lettered. However, a quick look on MyFonts
    could probably help you find something similar.\r\n\r\nSuch as http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/prints-charming/
    or perhaps a little more wildly swashed http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/treasury/
    or maybe more elegant like http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/sloop/ whatever
    you use you will probably need to skew it to be upright unless you like the more
    simple http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/typo-upright/"
