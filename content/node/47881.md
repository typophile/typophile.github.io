  no idea where to start.\r\n\r\nI work with music notation and there is a font on
  the market called Opus Note Names - it has letters inside the musical notation.
  \ However, this font doesn't suit all our needs so we thought we'd try to make our
  own.\r\n\r\nThe problem is - can you make a font that is already coloured?  (See,
  I have no idea about fonts at all :D)  I ask, because we want anything that is white
  in our font *not* to be transparent.  As it is, anything white can actually be seen
  through.  I'm looking for some kind of white fill to put on the white bits of the
  font.\r\n\r\nAny help for an utter novice will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you
  for your patience!"

    I don't know if it does it.  Can you recommend any software in particular?\r\n\r\nThank
    you again :)"

  body: "Nearly all modern software that handles styled text can change the color
    of the text too. Even with that, the whole character would still be a single color.
    Applying multiple colors to rendered fonts takes any variety of graphic design
    programs to do.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how that might be handled with the more
    specialized nature of musical notation layout tools, though."

  body: "Righto, thank you :)\r\nThe problem is that the music staff lines can be
    seen through any white bit on that font, making the letters extremely difficult
    to read.\r\n\r\n\"Even with that, the whole character would still be a single
    color.\"\r\n\r\nDo you mean that I cannot have black and white in the same character?
    \ (Eg, the black cirle, white centre, black letter?)\r\n\r\nThis is all beginning
    to look very complicated :D"

  body: "I mean that a character can have a single opaque color. For example, an \"e\"
    could be any solid color with a transparent hole through it, which would appear
    white so long as the background is white, but you cannot have an \"i\" that has
    a black shaft but also a red dot without using some graphics software that can
    separate the parts.\r\n\r\nThe holes in the letters like \"e\" are not white,
    but transparent (i.e, there is nothing there). If you are laying text over the
    music staff, the intersecting lines will appear between the letters and through
    these holes. You will either have to reduce the size of the type so it fits between
    the lines or move it to a non-interfering area outside the staff."

  body: "I think I understand what you want. You could create separations; that is,
    two fonts with identical metrics, one with the outlines and one with the fills.
    Then when you're using the font, you would duplicate your finished \"text\", change
    the font to the fill font, change the color to white, and put it behind the original
    (and in front of the staff). Of course, you would have to do that over again every
    time you changed something.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think the easiest solution to your
    <em>specific</em> problem might be instead to incorporate the staff into the font.
    For the purposes it will be used for, do you expect to be combining the notes
    into chords?"

    again so I thought I'd write back in here instead of starting a new topic.\r\n\r\nThe
    notes will be combined into chords, yes.  I create all of my scores in Finale
    (or perhaps Sibelius for these particular scores).  Most things are automatic
    (stave lines etc).\r\n\r\nI don't know why they would make this font and advertise
    it when it looks so terrible.  And there is definitely no font designing program
    which will fill the transparent space with white?  (If my company were to create
    their own notation font).\r\nThank you again...."

  body: It's hard to say what will work with your music composition programs. It looks
    like you could color notes white in Sibelius, creating a backdrop with the appropriate
    gaps. But I don't know if it will allow you to make a duplicate layer without
    the stave lines.
