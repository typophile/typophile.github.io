  years).\r\n\r\nI work at a church where Giovanni is used for most communications,
  and so I'm tied to using it or something that complements it.\r\n\r\nI'm tempted
  just to go with Myriad \u2013 it was designed by the same typographer, and I have
  it installed. But it strikes me as too easy. In the past I've seen Myriad overused
  not because it's a fantastic face (it is) but because it's packaged with Adobe software.\r\n\r\nShould
  I just quit complaining and go with Myriad or go with something more interesting
  (like Cronos, also by Slimbach). It's quite touchy-feely, which I think works well
  for a church.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    pedestrian.
