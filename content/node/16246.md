  identity for his startup...cornerstone 1 media. He'll be publishing books about
  the key knowledge that helps influence decision making before the adaption of technology.
  That's it in a nutshell.\r\n\r\nI've already shown him one round of designs and
  he gravitated toward the logo with the number one. This is the second round. Unfortunately,
  neither of us has a lot of time to spend on this so I'm trying to nail it down quickly.
  I would appreciate any comments or suggestions about the attached direction.\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much for your help.\r\n\r\nTammy"

  body: Hi Tammy, personally I see "Cornerstone Media" and don't read the "1" as part
    of the title. I'm not sure what anyone else will think, but I would look at trying
    to integrate the 1 better. It's always difficult to achieve legibility with this
    approach, personally I would look at using the dimensional 1 as a separate icon,
    and pull out the name as another element to avoid confusion. Best - Chris

  body: Thanks Chris...I definitely want 1 to be read clearly as part of the title.
    I'm wondering if using a stronger color for 1 would make it stronger. I'll keep
    plugging away.

  body: "How does this shape relate to the idea of a cornerstone? I know it's a corner
    but it just looks like the 1 is a dorr or something. I get a vague feeling from
    it.\r\n\r\nTake a look at this\r\n\r\nhttp://www.senate.michigan.gov/Virtualtour/Virtual%20Tour%20Pictures/CapitolDome/cornerstone%20copy.jpg\r\n\r\nThats
    a cornerstone. And with type too.\r\n\r\nI also saw this but I didn't like it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cornerstone.edu/\r\n\r\nWhat
    if you had 3 lines & a random stone shape. Get it? Corner, stone?\r\n\r\nIt's
    a tricky thing on short notice. But then you can't expect a miracle on short notice.
    Maybe you can talk him into more time. \r\n\r\nWhatever happened to *your* logo?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Eben's first link would make a pretty cool logo, I'd say. The use of a dimensional
    block could be pretty cool, particularly with that sturdy architectural detailing.\r\n\r\nI
    could definitely read the '1', but, as Chris K wrote, it doesn't feel integrated
    enough."
