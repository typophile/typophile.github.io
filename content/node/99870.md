  body: A quick view of the page source shows that they're using web versions of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/gabriel-sans/|Gabriel-Sans.]].
    The same truetype, opentype, and web fonts can now be used on both Windows and
    MacOSX platforms.

      to this one?"

  body: "There is no such thing as \"a standard font\". There are a few dozen fonts
    that are included with various operating systems and applications, and these vary
    from vendor to vendor and from version to version. Note that they are not 'free';
    their price is included in the price of the product. You ask for a font family
    that \"looks quite similar\". I'm afraid that that's a very subjective evaluation.
    To me, Times New Roman is 'quite similar'. After all, the A's both look like A.
    It depends on which attributes attract YOU. The best way to get what you're looking
    for is to get the real thing.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
