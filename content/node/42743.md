body: What's the Typophile policy about posting links to info on font-related malware,
  when the exploit is out in the open and the membership needs to know about it? There's
  something I feel is important, but I don't want to violate any policies. The link
  isn't to a "script kiddy" site, but does give programming info. Or should I just
  give the background info about the vulnerability without the link to the site?

  body: "I suppose it would depend on the nature of the security issue. On average
    just by tracking font related keywords via Google news I see one or two a month,
    a SUSE Ghostscript issue here, a Java exploit there, or a Apple server patch but
    I've not felt they needed to be publicized on typophile. \r\n\r\n\"membership
    needs to know about it?\"\r\n\r\nNormally the exploits don't affect font buyers
    or font makers - the main audience of typophile. Maybe the one you've come across
    does? "

  body: "Just wanted to reply to the thread. The details on this one are a bit different
    than those you commonly see, as the chap has built an actual exploit. More commonly
    researchers find a theoretical hole, but don\u2019t produce an actual exploit.
    \r\n\r\nReading the details (and not being a developer myself) the issue seems
    to relate to one particular technology, affecting all users of that technology.
    One would hope that hole is being plugged by the owners of that technology. But
    just to be safe I\u2019ve forwarded the details to technology owners at Apple
    and MS to make sure the scope of the issue is indeed limited. \r\n\r\nHaving said
    that I personally don\u2019t see any harm in linking to the article (although
    it would be good for the moderators to chime-in) as it does serve as a reminder
    that fonts are code, and share some of the same issues as code when it comes to
    security.\r\n"

    be useful. \r\n\r\nTypophile's main concerns for posts are that people not share
    information about pirated fonts/software, are not malicious or directly aimed
    at a fellow Typophile, and usually linked to type ... Thanks for asking"
