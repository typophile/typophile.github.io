body: "I am creating a wallpaper that is only type and wanted to ask some gurus of
  the business are there any particular faces that look amazing for a wallpaper. I'm
  a hefty sans-serif guy because I love the curves and the simplicity of sans-serif.
  \r\n\r\nI'm using Illustrator if that matters at all.\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced."
