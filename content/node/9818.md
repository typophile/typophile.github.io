  body: We have the adobe font folio over here, and I would like to use a font out
    of there if I could. The reason being so I don&#39;t have to go to the client
    and try to get them to buy it, because they won&#39;t.

  body: It isn&#39;t in the Adobe folio, but I do have it on my mac, so it must have
    come with something. Maybe Quark? I&#39;m not sure. It looks pretty good though.
    I thinnk I&#39;ll give her the choice of that one, or Mona Lisa and see what she
    thinks. Otherwise she&#39;ll just hvae to bit the bullet and buy the font. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks for your help. <BR>-Dave

  body: He correctly credits Kingsley/ATF as the source. The design is by Morris Fuller
    Benton in 1920&#39;s, according to Mac McGrew&#39;s book on American Metal Types.
    &#40;This explains why Nick Curtis and Red Rooster both produced digitizations
    of this typeface. Nick used the swash caps, and Red Rooster recently issued a
    <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=RRT0011498" target="_blank">Swash
    version</a> as well.&#41; <BR> <BR>Just my Font History bit for today <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
