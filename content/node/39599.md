  body: The Pro adds about 130 Latin characters to cover all European languages. If
    "Western" codepage is enough for your needs, I guess you won't need Pro.

  body: "Keep in mind that PostScript Type 1 format fonts may not be supported by
    applications for much longer :(\r\nSo if you aren't going to buy the OpenType
    version of the family, you may want to consider buying the TrueType version instead
    of PostScript. That would be the same price, right?"

  body: I guess this was about price difference between OpenType Std and OpenType
    Pro.

  body: For just over $200 more, I would go with OT. It is clear (to me at least)
    that this is going to be a standard for a lot longer than TTF.

    to my ignorance, but it says at font haus that the font supplier is monotype imaging
    and the supplier is adobe... could this be correct? '

    owning Linotype). You can buy it from FontHaus without worry.
