body: Any recommendations for a slab serif with a cyrillic character set? It would
  have to have an @font-face license. Looking for something in the neighborhood of
  Archer, Caecilia, Centro, Copse, Ernestine, Museo, Serifa. Centro may work, but
  looking for some other options. Thanks!

  body: "If it's not urgent, we'll release a new slab serif family (hopefully) during
    May/June. And it will include Cyrillic character set as well, as Light/ Regular/
    Bold with matching Italics. If I succeed, an matching sans family will be followed
    soon after releasing the slab family.\r\n\r\nIf it's urgent... try looking for
    some Paratype's  releases.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Thanks, Du\u0161an. It is pretty urgent, so I don't think we can hold out
    until May. Thanks for the Paratype tip, Pragmatica Slab could work."
