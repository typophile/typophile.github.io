  forum so I thought I&#39;d get your opinions before I release it. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t
  sorted out kerning yet and it needs a little more work but the bare bones are there.
  I plan to have 4 weights and matching italics/obliques. <BR> <BR>Alan Rimmer <BR>www.fatchair.com

  body: I think this got lost in the redesign - either that or it&#39;s unspeakably
    terrible! <BR> <BR>Any input would be much appreciated! <BR> <BR>Alan Rimmer

  body: I really like it - personally. I think it works great for headline - and obviously
    as body copy too. I think it is quite sexy - love those little lilting upswings
    &#40;very technical terms there&#41; on the tops of the lowercase letters. I kinda
    wish a bit o&#39; that was incorporated into the caps - but then I don&#39;t know
    if it would be too much. It might be well balanced already. <BR> <BR>Overall -
    fantastic - I&#39;d totally use it. It&#39;s not abnoxious at all. <BR> <BR>I
    won&#39;t comment on kerning or any other technicalities - just from visual appeal.

  body: it&#39;s got a great stencil feel to it, without being too informal/stencily.
    <BR>i don&#39;t think the caps need the flourishes at all. it would be too distracting.
    <BR>on the other hand, if there were alternates for drop caps, etc., that&#39;s
    a <BR>different story.i dig the stroke intersections w/the soft brackets, if they
    <BR>can be called that. pretty cool stuff. <BR> <BR>am i the only one who sees
    the W as... well, think fifties pin-up poster.

  body: Thanks for your comments - I presume you&#39;re referring to the top of the
    &#39;a&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39; etc when you say &#39;upswing&#39;? I did
    start with that applied elsewhere but thought it affected the legibilty of the
    face too much - I really wanted to design the typeface as a very &#39;usable&#39;
    one &#40;if it&#39;s at all possible!&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m happy with the soft
    brackets but unfortunately when I&#39;ve tried making the heavier weights this
    has been a problem as they look terrible with the wider brackets and really need
    thinner intersections. I think I may have to drop the heavier weights and maybe
    stick to to just two weights. Any ideas how to get around this problem?

  body: Just to let you know that that this typeface is finished and now available
    over at myfonts. I&#39;ve changed the name to &#39;Venkmann&#39; - Vasarely just
    didn&#39;t seem appropriate. <BR> <BR>I stuck with the 2 weights &#40;and italics&#41;
    although I may do the others if I feel like it &#40;and there&#39;s a demand&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>...and I can&#39;t believe I first posted it here over a year ago!
