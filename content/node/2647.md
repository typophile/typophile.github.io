  body: The font is based on the <i>Avant Garde</i> magazine &#40;hence the name&#41;
    logotype designed by Herb Lubalin, hence its inferiority to Futura &#40;in my
    unsolicited opinion&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, it&#39;s technically on the cover of <i>Avant
    Garde</i>, in that its inspiration is there, but they aren&#39;t all the same
    letterforms. For example, the Vs in the logotype have a vertical left extender,
    rather than an angled one. This would be a fun/ relevant example, at least, if
    not a strict example.

    were actually included in the original Avant Garde release as ligatures. I seem
    to recall that there was an entire series of cool display ligatures - even for
    the rub-down letters. But probably not for any digital release. <BR> <BR>Lubalin&#39;s
    <i>Family Circle</i> logotype comes to mind - although it&#39;s not Avant Garde,
    no doubt, but once again in the same vein.  <BR> <BR>And surely to god U&amp;lc
    used Avant Garde back in the day. If there are any issues of that around.'

  body: That&#39;s great, Mark. I suppose I&#39;m tipping my typographic hand a bit
    now. The ligatures certainly add a dimension that I wasn&#39;t aware of.  <BR>
    <BR>Avant Garde was held up critically next to Futura by one of my professors
    back in school, with great disdain. She said she&#39;d give us a &#39;retro-active
    F&#39; if she caught us using it. In retrospect, she was probably just violently
    steering us away from using it as a text face...  <BR> <BR>...now that I look
    at it, was that the typeface for the movie <i>Alien</i>? Not the one used on the
    poster, but the one used in the title sequence. Or am I confusing it with <i>Altered
    States</i> now? <BR> <BR>My cursory web research reveals that it may be a similar
    condensed face for <a href="http://www.fox.co.uk/home_ent/i/packshots/alien_boxset_repromo.jpg">Alien
    3</a>, but Avant Garde for <a href="http://www.movieactors.com/photos-sf/altered.jpeg">Altered
    States</a>.

  body: Curiously the Mobil face is not Avant Garde. <BR>It&#39;s a custom face done
    in the late 60&#39;s early 70&#39;s. <BR>By whom, I &#39;m not sure.

  body: Altered States was Avant Garde, Alien was Helvetica Black,  <BR>Aliens was
    Univers 39, Alien3 was ITC Kabel &#40;stretched&#41;, and  <BR>Alien Resurrection
    was Microgramma/Eurostile &#40;modified&#41;  <BR>with Helvetica Ultra Compressed.
    &#40;I guess maybe this thread  <BR>should have been on the Type ID Board after
    all. :-&#41;
