  and /hi/. Also about the space between the words. The design demands everything
  to be evenly spaced out, but I've looked at it for  so long... \r\n\r\nThanks for
  any comments\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/showtype2_4691.jpg]"

    design doesn\u2019t know squat about kerning\u2026IMHO.\r\n\r\nFont designers
    spend a great deal of time adjusting inter-letter spacing so that the end result
    is aesthetically pleasing. What credentials does the design have which would override
    such judicious spacing, hmmmm?"

  body: "I think you can use 2 approaches to this:\r\n\r\n1. close-but-not-touching.
    This is more mechanical, and will probably leave a few holes. But it's one way
    to do it.\r\n\r\n2. Triplets. Isolate 3 letters and make sure the middle letter
    looks optically centred. Take the \"ngs\" triplet, and you will see that the \"g\"
    is too far left. Once the \"g\" is balanced, then the \"n\" in the \"ing\" triplet
    will probably look a bit off. So balance that \"n\", and then move on to the next
    triplet. And so on.\r\n\r\nYou should try both these methods out and post the
    results. Also, print it out, squint at it, look at it upside down (either by doing
    a head-stand or simply rotating the page, whichever works best for you). And then
    -- repost."

  body: "Sorry, I was a bit tired and expressed myself terribly in the OP. I meant
    to write more about the whole design, but decided it ultimately doesn't matter.
    The \"even spacing\" comment wasn't directed at the kerning, just something I
    forgot to delete. \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for the advice. Here's my second attempt.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/showtype5_5953.jpg]\r\n\r\nCritique
    welcome. "

  body: "For me, and you need to know I'm mainly a text guy, the whole thing is too
    tight. This shows up with there being too much optical space between the double
    t's -- a problem with a lot of fonts -- and the s paired with the g, which everyone
    sees.\r\n\r\n(From my perspective) One solution is to get the negative space right,
    and not worry about whether or not the letters touch. The second is the same,
    but adding the requirement that the letters not touch means setting everything
    a bit looser.\r\n\r\nI think I can get display right, at least, for a book, but
    having said that, it's still usually 36-point or smaller. In your sample, one
    way you can go is to break up the existing rhythm by breaking things to a new
    line. That gives you just a little breathing room. You can further that by changing
    type size on a some lines. It all has to fit, to balance. Just how you get there
    is another matter.\r\n\r\nIn short, rhythm is a demanding master, but you can
    sometimes change it and get away with things. It is when the rhythm gets broken
    within a work that you have to compromise for the most awkward paring, and let
    that dictate the line.\r\n\r\nIn this example with \"gs\", I'd try condensing
    the \"s\" maybe 1-2 percent. \"s\" close to perfect with \"wheels,\" but not in
    \"things.\" Don't think 2 percent would hurt the \"s\" in \"wheels,\" as far as
    that goes. Maybe even a little more condensing would work --\r\n\r\nLots of little
    spacing issues with this font, but that's true with a lot of fonts that are \"commercial,\"
    as well. "

  body: "The tt bothers me the most, it really doesn't work at all. I tried to play
    around with putting title and name in two lines but I don't think I can make that
    work. For reference, here's a rough sketch of the design: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/andi_3846.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    know it's probably not a conventional solution but how do you think it looks when
    the t's are touching each other? IMO that at least somewhat fixes the problem.
    Is it bad? Maybe get them even closer together? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/showtype6_4838.jpg]\r\n\r\nGreat
    Idea with condensing the s though. In this version both are condensed by 3%, but
    it still feels akward. I cut off a bit off a tiny bit off the ear: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/showtype7_6067.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think you've gotten the \"s\" condensed just a bit much. As far as I'm
    concerned, the touching t's are preferable (some wouldn't accept it at all), and
    since they already touch, get the space between them smaller still. If you use
    a font editing program, you can go into the font & make up special characters
    as you need them. It's an open source font...\r\n\r\nBTW, as a general comment,
    at our shop, we only expect the kerning in a font to work for text-size setting.
    With 300+ pages, you don't want to be adjusting things by hand. On the other hand,
    we assume any display type will need handwork.\r\n\r\nFWIW"
