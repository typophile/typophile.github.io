body: "how do you convert a polygonal shape into a smooth oval shape in Illustrator?.
  the goal is to obtain a smooth curve that runs through the anchor points and not
  the red or the blue curve you can see in this image. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nred=start polygon\r\ngreen=approximate
  curve inside the polygon\r\nblue=not fitting outside curve derived from the inside
  curve"

  body: Use the pen tool, and keep your nodes at the extremes (farthest left/top/right/bottom
    as much as possible) and the bezier handles at horizontal or vertical.

  body: "with the pen tool i'm not able to obtain a smooth curve. the pen tool breaks
    the curve at the anchor points. the goal is to draw or render a curve smooth like
    an egg -- starting from an irregular polygon. \r\n\r\nmaybe some plugin?"
