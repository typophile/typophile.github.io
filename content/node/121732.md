body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\ni'm looking to find the blackletter font attached. It appears
  in Dan x Solo's book 'gothic and old english alphabets' from 1984. Known as monmouth
  back then, but the blackletter font now also known as monmouth is completely different
  so the one I want is difficult to search for... any idea if this font was renamed
  at some point? Similar fonts accepted...\r\n\r\nimage attached\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\na\r\n"

    it looks very very close to\r\nUncial Caps from Letterhead Fonts (found on free
    sites but not listed today on LetterheadFonts.com)"
