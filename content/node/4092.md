body: 'Newbie here... I blame the Typophile site, and this forum in particular, for
  rekindling my obsession with type. Consequently I&#39;ve been inspired to start
  working on this, my first attempt at designing a font &#40;not counting &#34;remixes&#34;&#41;.
  My goal is to make it fairly readable even though some of the letters are stylized.
  It still needs plenty of refinements, but I think it&#39;s ready for some feedback.
  Numbers and punctuation are coming soon, and eventually italics and bolder weights,
  depending on how ambitious I get. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32535.gif"

  body: 'This is pretty elegant. <BR> <BR>Some &#34;macro&#34; stuff: <BR>- The caps
    are too big. <BR>- The caps are very conservative while the lc is more progressive.
    Some difference between the two cases in this respect is generally good &#40;if
    only in an inescapable sort of way :-&#41;, but I think here the disparity is
    too much. <BR>- You might like to look at Berthold&#39;s Imago and Agfa&#39;s
    Rotis &#40;SemiSans&#41; for possible inspiration. <BR> <BR>And some micro stuff:
    <BR>- In the caps especially there&#39;s some wobbliness in the stroke thicknesses
    and skeletons. Like look at the &#34;S&#34;. <BR>- I&#39;d give the &#34;Y&#34;
    a bigger head, and make the &#34;Z&#34; narrower. <BR>- The &#34;g&#34; is really
    very good. Ideal modulation in the join. Maybe an oppen bottom though? <BR>- Why
    is the &#34;j&#34; short? <BR>- The &#34;k&#34; seems over-extended. <BR>- The
    top-lefts of the &#34;m&#34; and &#34;n&#34; seem out of place. <BR>- The &#34;s&#34;
    is too heavy on the bottom-right. <BR>- I&#39;d make the bar of the &#34;t&#34;
    like the &#34;f&#34;. You have a &#34;reductionist&#34; thing going on &#40;most
    notably in the &#34;a&#34;, and that&#39;s one reason I think an open &#34;g&#34;
    might be better&#41;, and the &#34;f&#34; fits that - so should the &#34;t&#34;.
    You were probably thinking along the same lines for the &#34;m&#34; and &#34;n&#34;,
    but in those two it&#39;s not working as it stands &#40;and what about the &#34;r&#34;?&#41;.
    <BR>- The &#34;z&#34; is leaning right. <BR> <BR>If you make darker weights, I&#39;d
    suggest increasing the stroke contrast a lot as you go up in color. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: '&#62;- The caps are too big.  <BR> <BR>I imitated the vertical proportions
    of Akzidenz Grotesk, since it is one of the more readable sans-serifs, but now
    that you mention it, the caps in AG are too big, aren&#39;t they? <BR> <BR>&#62;-
    The caps are very conservative while the lc is more progressive. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    going to try a straight-sided &#34;A&#34; with a rounded top, and see what rounded
    corners look like on some of the other caps letters. <BR> <BR>&#62;- You might
    like to look at Berthold&#39;s Imago and Agfa&#39;s Rotis &#40;SemiSans&#41; for
    possible inspiration.  <BR> <BR>Actually I think Imago was one of the sparks for
    this project. I&#39;ve also been looking at Optima, and even Bodoni &#40;its &#34;g&#34;
    shows up a little bit in mine&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62;- The &#34;g&#34; is really
    very good. Ideal modulation in the join. Maybe an open bottom though? <BR> <BR>I
    think the gap in the loop of an open-bottom &#34;g&#34; is often distracting.
    I tried playing around with opening it up, but settled for a closed loop instead.
    Since the &#34;g&#34; is already so much more complex than the other lc glyphs,
    the extra bit of white space makes the &#34;g&#34; stick out as too &#34;noisy&#34;
    in context. <BR> <BR>&#62;- Why is the &#34;j&#34; short?  <BR> <BR>Oops, an accident
    I forgot to fix. <BR>  <BR>&#62;- The top-lefts of the &#34;m&#34; and &#34;n&#34;
    seem out of place.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been struggling with these... A simple curve
    works on the &#34;u&#34; but looks gimmicky to me on the &#34;n&#34;. Making an
    assymetrical curve on the &#34;n&#34; &#40;sort of like FF Dax&#41; worked nicely
    until I tried to make an &#34;m&#34; to match, which looked ugly. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    &#40;and what about the &#34;r&#34;?&#41;.  <BR> <BR>It just doesn&#39;t look
    like an &#34;r&#34; anymore without the stem poking up a little &#40;I forget
    what that little part is called&#41;.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks for your keen eyes,
    Hrant. <BR> <BR> <BR>/ john'

    the &#34;g&#34; is too complex that makes an open bowl better. Looking at it topologically
    &#40;the &#34;layers&#34; of positive/negative space&#41;, only the &#34;B&#34;
    is as complex &#40;and at least the &#34;B&#34; has a calming symmetry&#41;. By
    making the bottom open&#42; you make the &#34;g&#34; much less complex - you basically
    make it belong more in the Latin alphabet. <BR> <BR>&#42; And I mean generously
    open, not like the way Baskerville and Meta have it. I agree &#40;if that&#39;s
    what you meant&#41; that such minimal &#40;almost apologetic&#41; openness is
    worse than none at all, especially in smaller point sizes where the gap becomes
    neither here nor there, so to speak. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: This are very good improvements in most of the letters but I thin that the
    original n,r and m were better, the n and m just need an adjustment on the top
    left for this not to look like a apendix but like a joint. Very nice work.

    better. I like the new _n_ and _m_ but not _r_. Abouth the _g_ i dont know, i
