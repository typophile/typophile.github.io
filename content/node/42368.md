  \"HTG\" who make gymnasium interiors etc.\r\n\r\nThe client actually came up with
  the logo idea. The \"T\" is a technical structure they use on a daily basis, so
  it seemed reasonable to me to make a logo out of it. What do you guys think? Has
  this logo got potential? If so, what could be improved?\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HTG_6703.png]"

  body: I like the use of the T beam.  the inside corners of the T might benefit from
    being slightly softened.  Currently, it's not clearly reading as "HTG" to me -
    might be best to sketch out different letter sizes, styles, and placements for
    the H & G to get it to read more clearly.  Overall - cool!

  body: "at first look it seems cool.\r\n\r\nBut there's some detail you need to work
    out.\r\n\r\n- I think that little \"fillet\" that stands between the \"T\" may
    be a problem, special when the logo is reduced.\r\n\r\n- I like the idea of the
    block working as a consistent block, and for that i would probably choose a type
    that has a rounder G.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nwww.nunocoelho.com"

    you think it will work?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Web Design Portfolio]]"

  body: "In your second concept, the G in the mark is reading more like a C.\r\n\r\nI
    like your original concept better. I think it works really well actually. Just
    needs some tweaking. I agree with what's been said already, so just run with that
    one IMO."

    version. Unless you think that this third version may be even better. I am not
    sure if people will \"get\" the idea behind it though. Please let me know your
    thoughts... Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo3_3447.png]\r\n\r\nP.S.

  body: 'The last one, due to colors and gradient, says "engineer" or "servers", not
    carpenter.  You might want to take more cues from the shapes of carpenters'' equipment
    and materials, if you''re going to explore directions that aren''t #1.'

  body: "OK, you've convinced me. The first version is probably the best, not only
    because it was initiated by the client himself.\r\n\r\nI tried to tweak the shapes
    a little as you suggested. The key problem, however, is that neither H not G is
    perfectly square. If I stretch H to become wider, it will look odd. What would
    you do to improve the situation?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo1_5802.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Web

    comment, about trying to make the T read more like a T.  I'd play with this arrangement
    using hand-drawn letters before getting into font territory.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/carpenter_5095.png]"
