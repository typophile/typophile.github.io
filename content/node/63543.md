    by Aldo Novarese will fit your bill. Released in 1962.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also
    the open source collaboration Titillium by Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino,
    released in 2008."

    pointing out Titillium for me. I don't know if I can use it for this particular

  body: I'd take a look at Nebiolo's Forma, an interesting italianate grotesque with
    a one-storey a, designed by Novarese and his team. It was never able to challenge
    the Helvetica/Univers dominance though. I don't think there's a kosher digital
    version in any case (but certainly some ripoffs).

    italian type designers in that timeframe?\r\nForma seems an interesting typeface
    to use, but if there is no digital version available it won't get me far... \r\n\r\n\r\nJeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

    that their typefaces were never digitized."

  body: "I made a redesign of a typeface that was only available from Nebiolo in hot
    metal. It\u2019s called <a href=\"http://typematters.de/tmt_Ba1.html\">Balega</a>.
    However, it is not a type for running text but it is rather good for headlines."
