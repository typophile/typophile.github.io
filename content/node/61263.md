  body: "There is something slightly Frankenstein-ish about this one. It seems to
    owe some of its outlines to something from the Rotis family, but stems have been
    amputated (from the d and u, and perhaps to make an 'a' from the 'd'). The G and
    S outlines could have been manipulated. I don't know about the 't' and 'e' --
    maybe borrowed from another font?\r\n\r\nA quick search of Dafont sans serif fonts
    did not turn this one up, but it looks like an amateur effort to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n-

    company, so while it still could be amateurish, I'd guess it's not.  I had just
    never seen anything quite like it before...."

    the older thread you posted. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you happen to be looking for
    something considerably more exuberant you might like Interga from Kimera Type:\r\nhttp://www.kimeratype.com/pdf/specimenIntegra.pdf\r\n\r\nMikey
