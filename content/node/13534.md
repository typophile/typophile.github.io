body: "Ray Larabie began drawing fonts as a hobby when he was a young boy. Encouraged
  by his family, his interest grew and transferred onto his first computer, an Amiga
  1000. By 1996 he had created a large library of fonts that he offered on his first
  website, [[Larabie Fonts]] as freeware. Donations keep the site going and he still
  adds new designs to the collection of over 250 fonts. \"They weren't all gems but
  they were fun to make,\" says Ray.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, he started a second foundry,
  [[Typodermic]], a commercial font site. \"The fonts are more professional and the
  families more complete but I still like to make a \u2018fun\u2019 one, now and then,\"
  says Ray. In 2003, he quit his job as Art Director at a video game company to pursue
  font design full-time. Ray spends most of his time on the computer doing what he\u2019s
  happiest at; creating custom fonts and adding new fonts to his websites. \"As long
  as the ideas keep coming,\" says Ray, \"I'll keep making fonts.\""
