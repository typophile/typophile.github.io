  based only on typography (a sort of swiss style inspiration). The site is all set
  on Helvetica, but I know most of my visitors are Windows users and do not have it
  installed (and even if they had it, I think the rendering of Helvetica on a Windows
  browser wouldn't be nice at all).\r\nSo I tried the fabulous [[http://typeface.neocracy.org/|Typeface]]
  script to replace my text and still make it accessible and gracefully degradable.
  My first choice was use Helvetiker, a ready-to-go Helvetica-like (actually Helvetica-clone)
  type, based on [[http://www.ellak.gr/fonts/mgopen/index.en.html|MgOpen Moderna]],
  but there's a serious problem: the font does not have some special characters I
  need, like cedilla (\xE7) and some accents (\xE1, for example). These characters
  are essential for me, since the site has its main version on Portuguese.\r\nI cannot
  use Helvetica itself since it is not embeddable. So anyone knows another free typeface
  very similar to Helvetica that has special characters?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    free font.

    is available on just about every computer in the universe. \r\nSaying Arial is
    all bumpy and jaggy, or Helvetica on a Windows browser wouldn\u2019t be nice at
    all, is puzzling.\r\nWould another clone be better rendered if it's embedded?
    I don't think so. When you are making a web site, you don't have the choice of
    embedding universal quality because of the lack of embedding, in \"client agents\",
    not OS or fonts, or big foundries.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n "
