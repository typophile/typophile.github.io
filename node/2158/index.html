  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've been wondering, has anybody discerned the logic (assuming it wasn't formally documented in the first place) of the Petrine reform of Cyrillic at the beginning of the 18th century? Like why was the cap U (the one that looks like a big Latin lc &quot;y&quot;) left/made into a form different than the Latin cap &quot;Y&quot;*, while something like the EM was made totally Latin? Was there some system to it? <BR> <BR>* BTW, wassup with the code point 04AE in Unicode? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">Have you read Vladimir Yefimov's essay on the Petrine Civil Type in <i>Language Culture Type</i>? It doesn't directly address the capital U question, but it does provide a fairly detailed history of the reform. Of course, at the final stage Peter the Great simply picked up a pen and crossed out a pile of stuff: alphabet reform by royal fiat, and I don't suppose the Tsar felt any need to explain himself. <BR> <BR>You might also track down volumes 3:4 (1969) and 4:2 (1970) of the journal <i>Visible Language</i>, which contain a two-part essay on 'The Genesis of Russian Grazhdanskii Shrift or Civil Type' by Ivan L. Kaldor. I don't have my copies to hand, so I can't check what information they might include about the alphabet reform. Kaldor was principally interested in identifying the specific Latin types on which the Civil Type was based. <BR> <BR><i>BTW, wassup with the code point 04AE in Unicode?</i> <BR> <BR>It's used in the Cyrillic orthographies of Azerbaijani, Bashkir and Kalmyk. Take a look at the lowercase form, U+04AF. I'm not sure when this developed. All three languages were written in variants of the Latin script in the 1920s and 1930s, until Stalin decided that the USSR should be a Cyrillic-only zone. But if you take a look at the images at <a href="http://www.pmicro.kz/~library/unicode/index.html">this site</a>, taken from M.I. Isaev's <i>Yazykovoe strointel'stvo v SSSR</i>, you'll see that the 'Y' is shown with a typical Russian U form. It is difficult to tell whether this represents the form used for these languages in the 1920s and 1930s or if this was simply what Isaev had available in 1979.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Obviously, I haven't read Yefimov's chapter yet. :-/ <BR>I'll have to bump it up my reading list&hellip; In fact I can make it second in line (after part 3 of that Ovink thing), not least because Typophile threads get &quot;closed&quot; after a month of inactivity&hellip; <BR> <BR>And thanks for the VL references. I recently finished &quot;mining&quot; Quaerendo all the way back to the beginning, and VL/JoTR can be next. Long live UCLA! Well, at least their libraries&hellip; <BR> <BR>&gt; at the final stage Peter the Great simply picked up a pen and crossed out a pile of stuff <BR> <BR>That's what I suspected. But I guess the preparatory stuff by &quot;advisors&quot; did guide the process to a large extent (at least I hope so). Nonetheless, what might be called the erratic, &quot;human&quot; nature of the process probably resulted in some strangeness. For example, for the cap U, I wonder if Peter saw a lc Latin &quot;y&quot;, and since it's &quot;tall&quot; he thought it was a cap, and he just took a fancy to it? But this is mostly just my imagination for now - I'll read up that material soon. <BR> <BR>&gt;&gt; 04AE <BR>&gt; Take a look at the lowercase form <BR> <BR>Huh, it looks like a van Krimpen Greek gamma. <BR> <BR>&gt; All three languages were written in variants of the Latin script in the 1920s and 1930s <BR> <BR>It seems that this is what would have made them used a more Latin form, although <BR>that lc is still strange - maybe it was to differentiate it from the mainstream/Russian form. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

All three languages use this straight-leg form <i>and</i> the typical Cyrillic U. In the new Azerbaijani Latin orthography (1992), the latter is written <i>u</i> while the straight-leg letter is written as <i>ü</i>. I'm not sure of the exact phonetic value.</div>
