I just want to suggest to add something to make it more convincing and more enticing to clients. Let&rsquo;s say you put some services for example <a rel="dofollow" href="http://www.integritylegalcorp.com/esi" title="e discovery services" style="text-decoration:none; color:#000000;">e discovery services</a> on a specific part of the logo.

Initially, I had the words &ldquo;Professional Law Corporation&rdquo; where &ldquo;Attorneys &amp; Counselors at Law&rdquo; is currently placed. I changed it because I felt the latter better demonstrated the roles we hope to take.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Our practice is limited to employment, immigration, and personal injury. One of my earlier drafts listed those practice areas below the name of the firm, in place of the &ldquo;Attorneys &amp; Counselors at Law&rdquo;. The O and T are our initials, but can also represent &ldquo;over time&rdquo;, as in employment wage &amp; hour law (but that wasn&rsquo;t my primary intent). The cross is a &ldquo;plus&rdquo; symbol, used in place of an ampersand, but also represents a simplified chess board. Strategy plays a significant portion in the practice of law, especially in employment litigation, so I was hoping to allude to that subtly. I experimented with including white or dark boxes around the O and T, or around the free squares, but that looked weird so I left it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Not bad for a non-designer! Normally I -and others here- advise
that people in your position hire a designer* but in this case (noting
that law firm logos arguably benefit from being conservative, which
means it&rsquo;s easier to do an acceptable job) you might get away with it.
Except maybe in the final polish -for things like proper spacing of the
letterforms (and shapes in general)- where you might still require a
professional to wrap it up. Also note that a logo does not an identity
make: unless you don&rsquo;t mind being somewhat generic with things
like your letterhead and physical signage, you&rsquo;ll need a professional
to render those elements properly.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://typophile.com/node/91610">http://typophile.com/node/91610</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One specific change I might recommend trying is to make the letter-
forms in the &ldquo;O&rdquo;-Plus-&ldquo;T&rdquo; a geometric sans-serif, instead of Warnock.
That would reinforce the nice &ldquo;strategy game&rdquo; angle, as well as make
the logo more reproducible (those small serifs in the &ldquo;T&rdquo; can easily get
lost in adverse reproduction condition). In fact you&rsquo;re already using a
sans (&ldquo;PC&rdquo;) and could nicely tie it all together that way.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for the compliments and the advice. I agree that I will need to hire a professional designer eventually, but I figured since I have an art background, I could make something for the time being.</p>
<p>I made some changes based on the suggestions that you and other made. I have a question about changing the &ldquo;O&rdquo;-Plus-&ldquo;T&rdquo; to a sans-serif. I am currently using Raleway for the &ldquo;PC&rdquo;. However, Raleway is too thin for the &ldquo;O&rdquo;-Plus-&ldquo;T&rdquo;. Do you recommend changing the typeface for the &ldquo;PC&rdquo; to match the sans-serif use for &ldquo;O&rdquo;-Plus-&ldquo;T&rdquo;? I ask because I really like the shape of the &ldquo;PC&rdquo; in Raleway.</p>

<p>Not only your letterhead, business cards, envelopes and signage, but also your business forms, website, print &amp; web advertising (perhaps even direct mail), etc.  I agree with hrant that it&rsquo;s not a bad start for a non-designer, but you should consider the advantages of having a design professional to assist you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About the &ldquo;PC&rdquo;, there is a legal requirement to say the form of the business entity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK. My main concern is that it might be confusing to potential clients who don&rsquo;t understand it or think it is referring to PC computers or whatever. You might consider showing it to some folks in the same demographics as your customer base and see if the abbreviation causes any confusion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So you have three separate entities going on here, is that correct? The O/T, the two line block of text, and the PC?</p>
<p>Well, the problem here is that you have three separate entities going on here. And remarkably it studders, lol.</p>
<p>Visually speaking, there is no flow to your &lsquo;construction&rsquo;. Instead it seems you are telling the same story - twice! Once via the O/T &amp; PC and again via the two line text block. And, if that&rsquo;s not confusing - or entertaining enough - you have used two different forms of letter shapes - serif &amp; sans serif!!  And of those two the PC visually - in a very awkward fashion - relates to the + sign of the O/T and the vertical separation line between the law firm&rsquo;s principal (or is it principle?)  names!! And and, you have repeated to use two separate colours!! Which relate fully worded text to two off balance letters. And resd those two elements - text line 1st and then off balance letters 2nd.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve said the same thing twice (in several different forms), and then forced it all together.</p>
<p>And if all that is not confusing enough - visual hierarchy - reads the two line block of text 1st,  the (my) eye travels right to left and sees the O/T 2nd, then the eye goes back over the two line block of text 3rd, onto the extreme right to visually pick up the PC 4th.</p>
<p>Is that how others here visually see this this &lsquo;constructoin&rsquo;?</p>
<p>At least you didn&rsquo;t use any clip art.</p>
<p>One thing I forgot to mention is the - again to me - the visual connection of the orange(?) fully worded text line beginning with the letter A and the off balance letter T. In my crazy graphic designer&rsquo;s brain it reads to TATTERONEYS - which could be a very profitable side business of law considering the recent articles written of  tattoo copyright (who really owns your tattoo design) and the Nokia vibrating phone signal tattoo patten pending.</p>
<p>Or, just TATTERONEY&rsquo;S, urban dictionary attorneys with tattoos?</p>
