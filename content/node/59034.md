  created in Illustrator by another designer.\r\nSaid designer has converted all type
  to shapes, and I can therefore not edit or ID this specific font.\r\n\r\nIt *looks*
  to me like FuturaBT. What do you say?\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows where I may be able
  to obtain FuturaBT fonts (preferably for free), can you kindly point me in the right
  direction?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.\r\n"
