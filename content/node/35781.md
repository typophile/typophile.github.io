body: "I just posted this in 'Blackletter', but maybe someone in 'Type-ID' knows more
  about this... I'm not sure ...\r\n\r\nVia Google books I saw a book, printed in
  some kind of Blackletter (Ueber Deutsche Runen, Wilhelm Carl Grimm, G\xF6ttingen,
  1821). The shape of the umlaut caught my eye, but I paid no further attention. Today
  I visited someone who had a piece of furniture with type on it. This cupboard is
  made in 1855 and the type used seemed familiar. Indeed, it featured the same kind
  of e-shaped umlaut on top of the 'a'.\r\nWhat font is it?\r\nArjen\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/umlaut-e_4533.jpg]"

  body: "The e above vowels is the regular design of an Umlaut in blackletter. It
    doesn't just look like an e, it is an e that moved from behind the vowel on top
    of it. \xBBBoese\xAB became \xBBB\xF6se\xAB. Two strokes or dots above the vowel
    are younger shapes that replaced the e over time.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately digitized
    blackletter typefaces often don't use the original shape. Try Alte Schwabacher
    or Breitkopf-Fraktur.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"

    keep on searching!"
