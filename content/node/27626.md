  body: "Hi Judah\r\n\r\nAccording to Jaspert's Enclopedia of Typefaces it was first
    produced by ATF in 1907, but became a stock face of many foundries subsequently
    - Stephenson Blake, Lulow, Mergenthaler Linotype, Lanston Monotype, Intertype.
    So it was ubiquitous, to say the least.\r\n\r\nThe most info I've ever seen on
    this face in a single place would be in ATF's 1923 Specimen Book - see if you
    can hunt down a copy - there'll be about 4 or 5 pages of very handsome specimen
    setting and some background blurb about legibility testing, schoolbooks and the
    like...\r\n\r\nOf course it was later the basis for ITC Clearface - but I suspect
    that it was a victim of the ITC house-style mangling when it got recut. "
