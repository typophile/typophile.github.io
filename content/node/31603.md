  if in the book they describe the fonts by categori.\r\n\r\nWhat I try to say by
  describing fonts is, example : \r\n\r\n<strong>Digital :</strong>\r\n\r\nMatrix;\r\nMrs
  Eaves;\r\nOut West.\r\n\r\n<strong>Old Style :</strong>\r\n\r\nGaramond;\r\nCaslon;\r\nBembo.\r\n\r\n<strong>Modern
  :</strong> \r\n\r\nGill Sans;\r\nFutura;\r\nFrutiger;\r\nUnivers.\r\n\r\n<strong>Transitional
  :</strong>\r\n\r\nBaskerville;\r\nBodoni.\r\n\r\nWhat I'am trying to say, I'am not
  able all the time to categorise a font, and a book who tell me this font is a modern
  font etc. are going to help me.\r\n\r\nI dont know if you understand what I mean
  ? "

    more than one book. I am impressed by the amount of fonts needed in everyday life.

    For example, Mrs. Eaves is a revival of Baskerville -- or maybe \"inspired\" by
    Baskerville? So, is it \"digital\" or \"transitional\" in your system? The three
    you term \"old style\" I would break into different categories, with, for example,
    Bembo being a Venetian.\r\n\r\nPeople classify fonts for varying reasons, so no
    one system is right or wrong.  "

  body: "The FontBook categories are Sans, Serif, Script, Slab, Display, Blackletter.\r\n\r\nIt
    also gives the name of the designer/redesigner, date of design, and \"similar
    to\" links.\r\n\r\nIt is not comprehensive, as some foundries are not included."

    resource for font classification. Classification systems are very much a subject
    of debate, as is which typefaces go where, so it's really up to you to nitpick
    for yourself."

    volume of all available typefaces. FontBook is just the most comprehensive.\r\n\r\nWhat
    may help you is the greatly expanded \"See Also\" cross references that relate
    similar fonts."
