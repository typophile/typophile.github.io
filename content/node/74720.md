  me to set up a bunch of names using this exact same font.  They of course have no
  idea what font it is and don't want to contact the previous artist.  Any help with
  the ID would be appreciated.  I know I've seen it before, but I don't seem to have
  it on this machine.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TERESA_6094.jpg]"
