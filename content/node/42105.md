  body: I think you've misplaced the definition of [[kern]] and [[hairline]].

  body: No, a kern is the funny little piece that sticks out and hairline is the thin
    part of a character.

  body: "Technically the <em>f</em> probably contains the only kern -- but the way
    I'm using the term here is really only relevant to metal. We don't usually use
    kern to refer to a part of the letterform that projects beyond the sidebearings
    anymore, now that the type body is no longer physical. \r\n\r\n(And I doubt that
    those parts of the <em>a</em> and <em>g</em> project beyond the sidebearings;
    but I'd have to crack open Minion and take a peek.)\r\n\r\nThat is to say, \"kern,\"
    as a noun, is no longer used to describe an attribute of a glyph shape, but rather
    a relationship in the glyphs metrics, and only makes sense in the context of a
    specific pair of glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe indicated portion of the <em>a</em> is probably
    most often called simply a \"terminal.\" That part of a <em>g</em> is usually
    called the \"ear.\"\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

  body: We've nattered over the meaning of terms here before but Kent's description
    of kern/kerning is widely accepted. In regards to your definition of hairline.
    My understanding is that it is not merely the thin stroke of a letter but the
    thinnest possible stroke of a letterform. In other words, your Bodoni sample contains
    hairline strokes and serifs, your Minion sample does not.

    waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too busy.\r\nthe slab serif
    is not really a slab IMO, it's simply unbracketed."

    find out. Good to know. Thanks for the criticism.

  body: "Kentlew, thx for the clarification. These terms originated from my days designing
    typefaces at Mergenthaler in the 80's when type was making the transition from
    metal to film.\r\nKen the hairline definition came from Ed Benguiat's typography
    class where he used the term the way we did at Merg as well \u2013 to delineate
    the thick and thin parts of a character. \r\nPaul, thx for the clarification \u2013
    I agree I should have used a thicker serif.\r\nStephen, thx for pointing me to
    Fontshop's anatomy. I found it useful\r\nEluard, many students in lectures have
    found this diagram useful, even if it may not be 100% according to everyone's
    definition here. i will amend it \u2013 but I wont repost it.\r\nThx to all."
