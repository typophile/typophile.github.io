  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a book designer who is at present undertaking an MA in graphic design. For my final project, duration of 1 academic year, I shall attempt to expose the significance of the space in typographic design, starting from exploring form &amp; counterform, then moving onto figure and ground, foreground and background and finally object and environment.</p>
<p>Seeing as there are many of you who are absolutely fanatical about type and design I would greatly appreciate if you could put your views across about the importance of space when using type. Also, if you have done any experimental work on this subject I would be very interested in seeing it - or if you have any other information (exhibitions, articles, books etc) that you might think it would be useful.</p>
<p>At present I have done an extensive amount research and have read many books. If anyone is keen on this subject I&rsquo;ll be happy to give you reading references an other materials I&rsquo;ve come across.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ana,
Space is an equal and integral partner in both typeface design and page layout of typography. The two forces of positive and negative require each-other to exist. I am not sure what is meant by experimental work since all work has some degree of it. Gui Bonsieppe of the Ulm School (Hocheschool Fur Gestaltung, Ulm), published an article in about 1958 in the Ulm Journal about the use of space in layout and how it improves comprehension. I wish I could find my copy for you! There have been numerous experimental movements in typography from DaDa, Bauhaus, Russian Constructivists, Swiss Modernists, and many more contemporary ones that have pushed the space and interaction threshold. 
Is there some specific notion you are looking at?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thank you for your reply Chris. I probably haven&rsquo;t made myself clear enough. I&rsquo;m new to these forums. When I said &lsquo;experimental work&rsquo; I guess I was referring to for example the works of Sandberg, Peter Willberg and more recently the alphabet created by Mathias Schweizer.</p>
<p>I have done an extensive amount of research not only about space in typographic design but i have also tried to compare it to use of space in fine art such as Matisse&rsquo;s paper cut outs, installations by Rachel Whiteread, type design &lsquo;miniscule&rsquo; by Thomas Hount-Marchard etc.</p>
<p>To my way of thinking, space is the core quintessential of typographic letterforms and typographic design. My aim is to visually express my statement.</p>
<p>So far I have broken down some existing fonts such as Bebmo &amp; Gill and created a typology of that font.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the semitic invention of the alphabet, the invention of the word is the single most important invention the I know. The word—and with it reading—is what has made western civilisation possible. I want to take stock of this turning point in the story of civilisation, but I cannot find reference to it in the history books, nor in the paleographic corpus. Even in cultural-historical literature the concept of the word does not make an appearance. I had to seek out the invention of the word on my own from reproductions of old manuscripts. If I can rely upon the dating of their origins, then the word appears to have been invented in Ireland in the first half of the seventh century.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kris,</p>
<p>Noordzij&rsquo;s history is not really correct, or at least is misleading. Hebrew and I believe other semitic languages had word spacing all along&ndash;you can see it in the Dead Sea Scrolls and even more ancient stuff. The Irish were re-introducing word spacing, not inventing it. Apparently with vowels&ndash;which Greek and Latin used and Hebrew did not&ndash;it is more possible to read without word spacing.</p>
<p>I got into a discussion via e-mail with Peter Enneson and Gerrit Noordzij about this, and ended up quoting to them the rules from the Talmud&ndash;well before the 9th century&ndash;specifying precisely how much to space words and letters.</p>
<p>So the Irish monks were re-introducing word spaces, and I would think were probably aware of Hebrew, Syriac, etc, which used them.</p>
<p>That being said, the reintroduction was, as Noordzij says, a big deal. I recently saw the exhibition of early Bible manuscripts here at the Smithsonian museum, and it was thrilling to see the great jump in readability of the Carolingan minscule&ndash;in the hand of Alcuin himself!&ndash;and the introduction of word spaces by those Irish monks.</p>
<p>Ana, when you cut up the letters and re-arrange parts you are destroying the &lsquo;notan&rsquo; that is there (strongly) in Bodoni.</p>
<p>Mark, you&rsquo;re right. Sorry for my sloppiness, I didn&rsquo;t check carefully.</p>

Years ago, when I taught design, I gave students enlrged segments of typeset lines that were cut into abstractions. We used them to discuss spacial interaction without interference from word meaning.

<p>This is great, and I wish you well. I also would like to point out that type made for reading, has three distinct &ldquo;grounds.&rdquo; Wheather one considers white space inside or outside of the letter, &ldquo;ground&rdquo; is clearly one thing, Among the forms, on the other hand, I consider those that repeat with any sort of frequency, like the main stems of H, E, L and P for example, as a secondary background against which the unique forms play. It is the unique forms then, like bottom of j or bar of H that are what we read with, and by the way design with.</p>
