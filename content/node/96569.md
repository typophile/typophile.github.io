  \r\nFound out Pilot Parallel which seems pretty interesting since i'm left-handed

  \"hardware\" do you use to help yourself creating letters?"

  body: I know that. I have 3 Art pen which are just... too hard to use. But Pilot
    Parallel... I've been seeing nice reviews about it because it goes "both ways"
    while an art pen just goes one way. I already bought on ebay two parallel so I
    can try it out.

    I suspect there is enough content for a book among the things that I've written
    on Typophile that I don't remember writing. Heck, some of it I don't even remember
    thinking. I am particularly proud of this contribution to that thread, though,
    which I think is one of the best things I've said on the subject of the 'software'
    of type design:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I think that Gerrit Noordzij's theory of the
    stroke provides one very strong analytical tool: one which I use every day when
    making decisions about shapes. Perhaps more importantly, I was instinctively looking
    at shapes in this way for many years before I read Noordzij's formulation of the
    theory. What Noordzij did was to expand my analysis, so that I saw and understood
    things that I had previously missed. Crucially, I think Noordzij has described
    the hermeneutic tradition within which type design exists, and has done so in
    a way that is independent of the lore, legend, personalities and advertising copy
    that make up much 'typographic history'. As I wrote earlier in this thread, a
    hermeneutic tradition is not something from which one can escape, and in some
    ways one is most deeply embedded in that tradition when one is critiquing it and
    finding reasons for rejecting it or extending it.</blockquote>"

  body: "Jason, the Typowiki entry on notan is a good explication of the word's common
    meaning and origins. Hrant's usage carries with it a number of additional assertions,
    which I think result in question begging when presented as such, but which are
    due proper consideration when posed as questions. So, for example, near the beginning
    of this thread Hrant asserts that notan ' is determined solely by the border between
    black and white', from which he infers then that outline drawing ('liminography)
    is the only way to attain notan in type design. Now, clearly, neither the first
    assertion nor the inference is implied by the common understanding of notan as
    derived from East Asian aesthetics of dark and light, as outlined in the Typowiki.
    Notan is something that exists whenever light and dark are present in direct relationship,
    so obviously exists in all typically contrasted text, whatever the means of its
    making. In terms of traditional use of the term, what matters are canons of beauty
    associated with notan, and hence it makes eminent sense to talk about notan in
    the context of calligraphy; indeed, this is one of the main uses of the term in
    Japanese aesthetics, and serves to link calligraphy with sumi-e  and other styles
    of painting that make use of light and dark relationships, and with traditional
    design practices. Hrant's use of the term, then, must be seen as novel or idiosyncratic,
    although I don't think there's anything wrong with that and find it a useful shorthand
    term for referring to something like 'the relationship of structure and space
    in type design, in which structure is presumed to be black and space white, or
    some similar dark/light contrast'. The problem I have with Hrant's use isn't its
    novelty or its independence of the common usage, but the question begging that
    goes into his secondary assertions and inferences. When these are rephrased as
    questions, the whole topic becomes more interesting to me and opens on to possible
    dialogue:\r\n\r\nIs notan a functional concept in reading? In what way?\r\n\r\nIs
    this functionality enhanced or impeded by (para)chirographically achieved notan?\r\n\r\nWhat
    other design processes might be used to create typographic forms?\r\n\r\nHow do
    you establish criteria for functionally good notan in a writing system independent
    of writing?\r\n\r\nThere are other questions that follow from these."

    claim that 'notan is the only thing that is read'. But that really does demand
    a very precise technical definition of notan from you, one which accounts for
    letter recognition as well as bouma recognition, since both are pretty clearly
    activities within reading. I'm not sure if I've ever seen such a definition from
    you.\r\n\r\nEarlier in this thread you stated that notan 'is determined solely
    by the border between black and white'. Evidence indicates that we don't perceive
    the border between black and white <em>as such</em> at text sizes, only at larger
    sizes. So it might be useful to elaborate on the function of notan relative to
    spatial frequency in small areas and structure recognition."

    I think it's more of an abstract truism - not very actionable except for laying

    is \"bouma\", and I firmed that up back when I wrote the piece \"The Bouma Supremacy
    \u2014 they should have left Herman alone\" :-) for Typo magazine (issue #13):\r\n\r\nA
    bouma is a cluster of letters that is recognized -in parallel with other boumas-
    as one thing, anywhere in the field of vision, thanks to a combination of frequency,
    contextual expectation, distinctiveness and clarity. It can be a single letter
    (in the fovea, where single letters are fully clear), it can be a whole word (deep
    into the parafovea, thanks to high frequency, expectation and distinctiveness)
    but is not necessarily either. So a letter is a special-case bouma, and so is
    a whole word.\r\n\r\nAs for \"notan is determined solely by the border\", I mean
    \"determined\" in the mechanical design sense: it is what we make when we're making
    a glyph (a reality that [para]chirography contradicts). The border isn't what
    is perceived by the reader; that would be notan.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Etymologically <em>para-</em> is <em>beside</em>, <em>alongside of</em>, <em>by</em>,
    <em>beyond</em>. For me para-paraphrastic is not a program or stance, but a [adding
    now: <em>universal</em>] type-historical fact.\u201D\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/48843#comment-299053\r\ni.e.,
    my post (last page) of 1 Sep 2008 \u2014 4:01pm\r\n\r\nMuch of this is serious
    word-play. The root word in all of this is <em>paraphrase</em>.\r\n\r\nIn the
    next paragraph I wrote: \u201CLegato is para-paraphrastic\u201D and explained
    what it might mean to say this.\r\n\r\nElsewhere I wrote that what Hrant calls
    chiro-graphic is actually <em>chiro-referential</em>.\r\n\r\nLegato is para-paraphrastic
    without being directly chiro-referential. Hrant likes to use the phrase anti-chirographic.
    Anti-chirographic is a stance or attitude \u2014which Hrant is keen to promote
    \u2014 that I would call anti-chiro-referential or post-chiro-referential.\r\n\r\nThe
    importance of saying Legato, for instance, and Turnip too, are para-paraphrastic
    is that it recognizes that nothing is from scratch, and encourges one to trace
    how the contrast in and construction of Legato deviate from conventional writing
    in it\u2019s variants. In the thread I used the <em>para</em> word \u201Cparasitical\u201D
    and discussed the essence of type-design as feature manipulation that involves
    positive and productive or beneficial norm-violation, which \u2014adding to this
    now \u2014 in digital technologies is splino-graphic or bezier-o-graphic or vector-based.
    [same thread, starting with 1 Sep 2008 \u2014 6:40am, point 4 of the second set
    of points.]\r\n\r\nThe shapes produced by actual conventional writing with a broad-nibbed
    or pointed-nibbed pen can, if they are well-understood, function as a template
    for understanding the nature of the forms in faces that are produced by para-paraphrastic
    feature manipulative work or play. The goal can be enhanced readability or expression.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding
    the <em>nature</em> of the forms as shapes in para-paraphrastic / non- or anti-
    chiroreferential instances is <em>not</em> achieved by trying to write these forms
    with varying pressure on, or twists and turns of the broad-nibbed or pointed-nibbed
    pen, but seeing the para-paraphrastic / non- or anti- chiroreferential instances
    against the background of the form-templates \u2014 as form-analytic foils \u2014
    these tools produce.\r\n\r\nGerrit Noordzij showed me the heuristic value of this
    in relation to the \u201Cclipped\u201D forms of Henk Krijger's Raffia Initials
    and the similar forms of his contempory Helmut Salden.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hk_ri_G_clipping_5958.jpg]\r\n\r\nI

    the place of 'the map of salient whites' in reading (see the \u201Cbouma as bounded
    map thread\u2019) we can see why Bloemsma is justified in thinking he is reconnecting
    (optically, \u2018after-helvetica\u2019) the single units of our scripts, or restoring
    and extending the optical integrity of the wordform.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn saying \u201CBloemsma\u2019s

    satisfied with having providing a bit of push-back. Your truism about notan could
    use some of that as well, as John's engagment on that score suggests. Despite

    even, or especially in a from-scratch process \u2014 the designer has to get a

    his or her positive and negative shapes, if he or she is going to exploit the
    products of his or her liminographic explorations intelligently and productively
    and make them into an internally cohesive font that promotes internally cohesive

    like bowls and stems, counters) of the light and dark. Liminography <em>adjusts</em>

    Visual or optical equi-potency in the distribution guarantees that both the white

    visual processing within the framework of the word-gestalt. This is what, in my
    analysis, the user needs.\r\n\r\nThe written forms that have been effectively
    built upon para-paraphrastically in the typographical era do not persist in their
    typographic progeny because of authorial preference or narcissistic indifference,
    but because they proved to be fit for reading as a visual task. The contrast and
    construction options they engendered facilitated the psycho-physical unitization
    of the word-object, a language-appropriate level of bouma-divergance, and guaranteed
    the automaticity of rapid and effortless visual word-form resolution for skilled,
    non-dyslexic readers,  That is, what the visual cortex of the end-user needs for

    has always been the principal countervailing pressure or hidden hand in the determination
    of what scriptorial conventions survived.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the reading / writing

    the evolved structure and plasticity of the brain, right down to the very first
    layers of the visual cortex and structure of the retina. The reading-ware of the

    I admire your tenacity and appreciate your restlessness. I think most of us are
    with you here. But breaking the black is a crap shoot, unless it\u2019s done systematically
    in followable and well-considered / well-motivated ways. And liminography is even
    more of a crap shoot, unless the critical opening drag-line paraphrases something
    you\u2019ve assimilated \u2014 perhaps with modifications \u2014 from past designs.
    Progressive evolution is descent with modifications. The farther you go back into
    typographical lines of descent, the closer you get to actual successful species
    of writing, so a Noordzij style analysis of form is actually very relevant, and
    your opening move already evokes writing. I'm assuming your opening drag-line
    (the opening line a spider puts down) is not a context-less \u2018random-walk\u2019
    line. Nothing that we\u2019ve seen from you so far shows me that your method brings
    you any closer than Dwiggins or Bloemsma, or Matthew Carter, or David Berlow,
    or Lucas de Groot, or Peter Verheul, or Gerard Unger to the optimal zone on the
    plateau that Matthew Luckiesh\u2019s research and hints from \u2018noisy accumulator\u2019
    models of perceptual processing suggest exists. What we've seen from you is interesting
    amd idosyncratic, but not monumentally compelling.\r\n\r\nNotan is only one of
    the things the visual cortex needs for effortless and automatic word-recognition.
    It also needs well-formed and tractable positive and negative shapes, at the level
    of stems and bowls and counters, that it can readily assimilate or understand.
    \r\n\r\nI would like to see your notan-sensitive liminography in action, preferably
    on you-tube, where I can see what you're doing, with a play-by-play voice-over
    of what you are thinking when you are doing, and an mri. I'm not interested in
    finished forms, just the self-imposed constraints and decisional feedback loops.\r\n\r\nBut

    while. And it is in fact the flaw in Bloemsma's work (which I might have actually
    opined to him once - I forget). Like most designers, he's too Modernist. You have
    to let go. <em>Life</em> is a crap-shoot. Which is actually harder for me to work
    with than it is for most people, even for most designers. But that's not the same
    as random (which I'll never be a fan of).\r\n\r\nSo you take you <em>liminographic</em>
    tool of choice, you clear your mind of chirography, and you make notan. That's
    it.\r\n\r\nProgress is hard.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Nothing that we\u2019ve seen from

    the proto-implementations of my ideas yet (for various reasons). In fact my usable
    output remains firmly in the realm of parachirography (for which I publicly reprimanded
    myself during my talk in Mexico City by slapping my own hand :-). But admitting
    the problem is the first step (and -unlike most practitioners- I've gone quite
    a bit beyond that).\r\n\r\nMaybe I'll never make anything usable with these ideas.
    But to me that's still better than never having good ideas to begin with; better
