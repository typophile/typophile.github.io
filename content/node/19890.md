body: I don't know where else to post this, but I've noticed a problem on this site.
  I tried to attach an image to a comment/reply in the forums and there didn't appear
  to be any way to do so, on my PowerBook G4 17" running OS 10.4.6. But at work (on
  a desktop Mac running 10.3) I noticed a link to insert a file on replies. I came
  back home and rolled over where that link is supposed to show up and the cursor
  thinks there's a link, but nothing happens. I tried Safari, Firefox and IE -- all
  the same. Is this a bug anyone else has experienced?

    body: I'll look into that. Any other suggestions? I assume that the lack of replies
      means it's not a widespread issue.

  body: So at work you see "Insert Image", but at home you do not?

    body: That's right. It's weird because at home it's like it's there, but invisible
      and non-functioning.

  body: I would guess that it is the plug-in. You need to see "insert image" in order
    to be able to do it.
