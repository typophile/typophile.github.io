  body: Although I do love the general feel of the letterforms, I think the little
    stems are totally unnecessary and would look much better without them. Really
    nice feel though, would look great as an information graphics typeface.

    much more passive without them. However I do agree that they feel a bit 'tacked-on'.
    Perhaps if they were larger and blended with the letterforms a little better.
    \r\nAt the moment they remind me of the tag hanging out the back collar of a t-shirt! "

  body: "First impression when I saw the images: \"Oh my... this is really nice!\"
    So the font itself is very very nice and has a strong character to it. I'd definitely
    keep those \"ears\" but I'd make them part of each letter because right now they
    do look like they've been glued on them. The width is different, they don't have
    a natural flow with strokes...\r\n\r\nBut all in all, this would make a very strong
    face. I'd also add a more text face to this family. This one is more or less just
    display font. But I can see its use in strong and powerful industry identity system.\r\n\r\nVERY
    NICE."

    a way that it's not over the top, like some of the other typefaces that are somewhat
    in this genre.\r\n\r\nI agree about the terminals though, they need to become
    more part of the characters themselves. I think the flat endings of those parts
    should be more 45 degrees.\r\nIt is obvious that this is a display face, but I
    would like to see short snippets of text set in this, just a couple of sentences.\r\n\r\nKeep
    it up!"

    \r\n\r\nThe ones on the left has slightly longer ascenders and descenders than
    the on on the right which is also increased a little from the last version due
    to problems with the f (any suggestions on another way to solve the f and keep

  body: I like the one with the shorter asc/descenders better. I do see that the 'f'
    might get in problems then, but I think it doesn't look too bad with the crossbar
    on the x-hight, eventhough the space between the crossbar and the top of the 'f'
    gets quite small. I say this because I'm not sure I like the crossbar in the middle
    of the letter, instead of on the x-hight. It's not ugly, but it does look kinda
    weird. ;)

    please make the version with shorter ascenders. goes better with the rest of style."

    your l, because it looks lighter than the rest of the stem.\r\n\r\nBut regarding
    your terminals... I can see why you made them thinner at first... Because they
    add too much to the style. If I were you I'd keep the bolder ones that you proposed
    and make the ones that are a combination of the 1 line middle and bottom line
    right with not right angled termination. that will make them subtle but still
    part of the letter. YOu could also do a bit of a stroke variation like in the
    2 line middle... If you know what I mean.\r\n\r\ngreat work so far mate."

  body: top middle is probably the closest to the original "glued" ones that just
    add a bit of life to the letters. All the rest are too strong and outstanding
    to me. Overpowered.

  body: I know little about type design but I prefer the shorter ascenders and descenders.
    Have you thought about rounding the terminals once they are a little longer. They
    remind me of little devil ears at the moment, very nice. I might also do alternatives
    with the terminals up or down on the characters just to give versatility. You
    might get a word with a lot of only up or down terminals and it might get too
    much.

  body: "I look at your typeface for a while and I think the problem is not the terminal.
    I like terminal on some typeface. Also, you're not force to use it at each letter.
    You can decide to use it on the a but not on the b, on the d and on the p but
    not on the q, may be on the r and so on. The problem, to my point of view, is
    how the terminals are. You choose to use them at an angle of about 45 degree,
    have you try to draw them align on the alignment line at 90 degree? Or use the
    same angle of the top of the b or the a bowl. Of course it's only some suggestions.
    Keep going - BTW I like terminals.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n"
