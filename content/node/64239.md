  body: "The SunDogs typeface seems a bit too techno. Soft rounded curves don't say
    'tough' to me.\r\n\r\nNow <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/ironmonger/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D66%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DTough%2520mother%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%252Cot.liga%26seed%3D29\">Ironmonger</a>

    I'm substituting one clich\xE9 for another, but I wonder.\r\nHow physical is construction
    these days?\r\nDigging holes with a backhoe is sedentary work.\r\nPower tools
    for everything.\r\nIt's the dance moves that keep David Hodo (Village People)
    so trim :-)"
