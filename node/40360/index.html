<div class=commentbody>Typophile is a great international, informal on-line school for type design. It is an unsystematic but passionate and high level tutorial for learning type design, with some great teachers. And a lot of BS--you get to decide which is which :)
Yay Typophile! </div>

<div class=commentbody>If it was me, starting out young and wanting to be a type designer I would go and knock on the door of a type designer/firm I admired.
I have a Japanese-born acquaintance who wanted to learn the art and craft of the baren. He knocked on the door of the master every day for over a year and was rejected. True story. After a while he was let in to sweep the floors.
He pulls in about six-figures teaching this stuff at Yale.

<div class=commentbody>uhmm I almost post similar topic. anyway! my question is where is good school (bachelor degree or associate of art) to learn typography at USA or Canada or Northern Europe? I saw some schools like Art center and School of Visual art. Their curriculum quite promising but its very expensive! I don't think even with a loan, I can get the money to go to school at there and living at there. Also, is a degree is really matter in the typography/design world? I want to graduate with a knowledge at least how to make my own typefaces. I want to try Ai Schools but uhmmm....

"Do you mean typography or type design?"
Hmmm both? I want to be good in typography and also, have big! knowledge of type design.
I mean, I am just want to into at typography(logos,poster,motion title,experimental type design). I am not that fancy when it comes to packaging design (but I must take it!if Choose to learn graphic design **sigh** )
I did heard about Academy of Visual Arts in Leipzig but! I don't think they are teaching in English :( I am thinking to go to Sweden but I still have no clue about which schools is good at there.
yeah..! if only typophile can offer a degree! it would be awesome! even its going to be long-distance learning. A lot of schools offer that! </div>

<div class=commentbody>So you're just looking for a good design university that has solid typography teaching. There's a lot.
Ocad has a graphic design program that covers all of what you're after. They also have a very good type design teacher, Greg Van Alstyne. You can take typeface design as electives and there are several mandatory typography courses.
But go to Europe if you can.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>I’m pretty sure my degree from OCAD has the words “University of Imagination” somewhere. Sounds pretty fake to me.</em>
Oy. When I was doing my Masters defence (in Environmental Design), you had to incorporate the words "a sense of place" somewhere, on threat of being forced to rewrite and redefend.
Back when I lived near DC, I remember watching an advert for some "institution" that had a guy saying "I've done so well since I got two Masters, I decided to get a third."
Yeah, what everyone needs: the third degree....</div>

Yeah, I personally think its better to go to Europe for design.
Which part of Europe you guys recommend it? I really want to go to London but I am just afraid the cost of living can cost me double. Other than that, I'm really considering to go to Netherland or Sweden and yeah,I am thinking to learn basic conversation of their language first before I am going to the university.
The reason, I want to go to Sweden because I just fallin' in love with the Swedish Design. </div>

I really dun mind to go to Norway or Sweden (lower cost, have few fav design agencies that and also, they speak English)
Plus! I prefer northern europe cuz I always fancy their culture and uh uh uh gurls
**sigh** why they only teach only on Germany or French :( Maybe I should moving to Netherland and ask my grandmother to teach me the language.
Any suggestion around Asia? **totally going to be very low cost for me lol**
Btw, the Program from Bergen so far look what I am looking for and they have a website in english. I should contact them to learn more about the tuitions etc </div>

<div class=commentbody>><em>**sigh** why they only teach only on Germany or French :( Maybe I should moving to Netherland and ask my grandmother to teach me the language.</em>
Because: (these are just my guesses…)
1. German, French, Italian, and Rheto-Romanish are Switzerland's four official languages. German and French are the two biggest. Zürich is in the German-speaking part of the country. Despite the increasing amount of English spoken among Swiss, the official "second" language in Zürich is likely to be French.
2. Both the University of Reading in the UK and KABK in the Netherlands teach their postgraduate typeface design courses in English, even though the Netherlands, for example, only has one official language—and by golly, it isn't even English!
3. The French and the Germans (as well as, err… the Swiss) have their own brilliant histories of typeface design, which are rather quite separate from England's and that of the United States. Maybe they'd like to continue working in these spirits instead of, umm, burying them ;-)
4. So that people who come from other countries to study there go through the effort of learning the local language and expanding their own minds and horizons at the same time. The whole world doesn't speak English, nor should it!
5. Switzerland only joined the United Nations a few years ago, and heaven only knows if they will ever join the EU. They are a democracy, and they like doing things the way they please.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Haha I'm from Vancouver as well and I can tell you, it's not fun when you start living in real winters with no car and no proper winter jacket because the only time you need any semblance of winter gear living in Vancouver is for traveling from bar to bar in Whistler.
Right now I'm sitting in my Toronto studio, it's -6 with 35km snowy winds. Which is why we're moving to Spain :)
Anyway I wouldn't go to Asia for school. I think generally it's a better idea to go to Asia after you have some experience as it can be hard to start out there. I'm talking mostly about Singapore and Dubai.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Dan for the information(i love you my man :)) Sorry to up set you though and uh uh I know the world doesn't speak English (me, myself fluently speak in 3 different languages)
Miss Haley hahaha yeah I know what you mean but seriously, I prefer -15 degree with snowy winds rather than hot humid season. I am originally from Singapore and yeah! it's really hard to starting out at there. Most of my friends complained a lot cuz at there work 7 days a week with min 12 hours shift (they don't get any health benefit)
Spain eh? fancy..!
btw, I saw your website and seems you have some experience with interactive design. I just wondering, is that hard as a starter interactive designer? should I be good at action script? or just have good graphic design portfolio?cuz so far, most of the agencies in here looking more flash wizard.

<div class=commentbody>First off you're crazy for liking the winter!!
I love working in interactive. As for coding, my office is larger (around 700 people), so we have the budget to have people to do the coding for us. My job is mostly all concept work and design. But I do know Flash and Actionscript because I don't think you can adequately design something to be produced in Flash if you don't understand the program or how the web works and how users interact with it. My boyfriend is also in interactive in a smaller agency (50 people) and because of that he needs to do some coding and flash work.
You don't want to apply to an agency as a flash person because you probably won't be doing much of your own creative work. Flash people = production, not creative. It's smarter to get an in as a creative intern then it is as production. Basically what's happening in the industry now is clients are expecting web elements to all their campaigns, where-as before it was more of a specialized thing. So agencies had to start outsourcing the production of the sites to smaller development companies until they realized they were getting totally fleeced by them. That's why there are so many flash and programming jobs opening up in-house right now.

<div class=commentbody>@Miss Giggles: Indeed, Typophile is no classroom and it won't provide the experience students seek, however I would argue that Typophile is still an excellent resource for students and professionals alike. It really all comes down to how you use the information you are given (maybe treating others with respect also, IMO). I am unsure of where you get your information, but students are absolutely welcome here and make up a very significant portion of the entire Typophile community.
I will advise that you please keep the rude remarks off this site. So far, most of your contributions in this thread (and others) have been potentially hurtful to others, and the insults will not be tolerated. Name calling will get you nowhere here, and it certainly won't in your professional life either. If you have a problem with anyone in particular, please contact them offline, or contact one of our moderators to discuss.

<div class=commentbody>@Miss Giggles: I said it before, I will say it again -- if you have a problem with someone or something, you should contact a moderator offline. Please keep the excessive rants out of the forums. I have read through your posts (past and present) as well as what others have posted and in no way do I believe that you are being discriminated against because of your age or your status as a student. I do believe that your words and inability to be civil do have something to do with your reputation here.
I won't continue this discussion in this forum, or any other. We'd be happy to discuss it offline, but I will ask you one more time to keep your insults and name calling off of Typophile.

<div class=commentbody>Schools with a major in typography (not graphic design) are very rare. In the old days, typography was taught more as a printing discipline than a design discipline. Since the digital era has pushed that task to the graphic designers, courses in typography are but a part of the designers coursework. Type design majors are even more rare. Yves may have named most of them above.

<div class=commentbody>We should be able to update the wiki then. Most of the schools listed have their programs listed online. But if it's just a list of graphic design schools wouldn't it get really really long?
Perhaps it could be limited to schools that other member recommend?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Why do I have to trawl thru all of this just to get some basic information!? :^P ;^) :^D
OK, if you read my original question carefully, you'll notice I specifically ask for 'typeface design' -- no 'graphic design', no 'typography', no whatever, That's what I meant with the [[Education]] wiki being tainted: there's all kind of education in there. The only thing I need to know is 'typeface design'. Thankoo thankoo for the leads so far.</div>
