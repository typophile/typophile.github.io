  what the conversation was about his \"readable\" site? I know that dberlow had some
  fine things to say about it, but I can't seem to find any mention of that thread
  using Google searches or trying to manually scan old posts. Anyone know the link?\r\n\r\nIn
  any case, what brings it up is this comment made by someone on an email list I subscribe
  to:\r\n<code>\r\nReading on screen is much harder than reading on paper of various
  and documented reasons.\r\n\r\nThe perfect readable webpage has columns, perfect
  typographic formatted text, no visual clutter/disturbance, pagination and a elastic
  layout that fits different screen sizes.\r\n\r\nI suggest a read-this feature working
  much like a print-this feature, with usable read friendly text in a modal window
  like all lightbox clones, with support for dynamic columns and paginating based
  on character/word count.\r\n\r\ncheck http://www.billhillsite.com/standardsp1.htm
  for an example of readable webpage\r\n\r\nI`d like to get some feedback on my idea
  of a read-this feature, with articles/pages 100% optimised for readability.\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\nMy apologies for posting this edited and out of the original
  context. No offense was meant.\r\n\r\nEDIT \r\nWas originally titled: Readability

    great. eMusic.com has a very nifty new user interface, and one of the features
    is that they show an excerpt of the reviews on the left hand sidebar. Upon clicking
    on it, a nice lightbox-style modal window opens with the full text at a decent
    size and setting, making it extremely easy to read.\r\n\r\nI love the feature.
    \r\n\r\nNow as to columns, it comes down to 3 options: Do I want to have one column
    a mile long? Do we want to split that single column across multiple pages, or
    do we want to be more daring and try to fit a variable length and (accessibly)
    variable sized text into multiple columns?\r\n\r\nI hate paged navigation the
    same way I hate jumps ( SEE MORE ON PAGE B6 ) in a newspaper or magazine design.
    Multiple columns have yet to appeal to me because of their inconsistency. \r\n\r\nThat,
    by default IMHO, makes a single well designed column the best solution. Breaking
    it out of the page and into a modal box is a grand idea, and I might actually
    think about implementing something like that in one of my next wordpress designs."

    writings and didn`t keep track of who wrote what and it seems like the edit option
    on this forum has time constrains. That`s no excuse for not giving credit when
    quoting, so I`d like to apologise.\r\n\r\nThe article brings up some really interesting
    thoughts and I`d like to quote you some more and comment:\r\n\r\nQuotes are from
    Joe Clark`s excellent article \"Unreadable\" published in Scroll Magazine: [[http://scrollmagazine.com/number-1/unreadable]]\r\n\r\n<cite>It
    is just barely practicable to read a long document on screen if the document is
    pretty much the only thing on that screen. How often do you see a page like that?
    Almost never.\r\n\r\n<cite>Links make it possible to get the hell out of there.
    Even if a page is so brazen as to contain no links, our browsers helpfully give
    us a \u2018back\u2019 button, a search box, tabs (including methods of displaying
    40 tabs at a time), and unlimited bookmarks. HTML gives us a special kind of link,
    the alternate RSS link, which provides \u2018a river of news\u2019.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>A
    link means it\u2019s possible to go somewhere else. Links are intrinsic to the
    web (and to certain predecessor technologies such as gophers). Links make it seem
    like you\u2019re doing something wrong if you rest motionless on one page too
    long. The hyperlink is a Freudian construct \u2013 an oral fixation of continuous
    consumption delivered by automated software. Open wide. </cite>\r\n\r\n<strong>Thats
    why I`m thinking load about the modal window approach.</strong>\r\n\r\n<cite>People
    respond to the difficulty of on-screen reading in three ways: they suffer without
    really knowing why; they give up the reading task as soon as possible; or (for
    the elite) they use every trick in the book to reduce discomfort. I fall into
    all those categories at different times, especially the last \u2013 I put unreasonable
    effort into printing out web pages so I can read them comfortably over double
    espresso the next morning.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>For the people who merely sit and
    suffer, the best we can do is improve their computer\u2019s defaults, as with
    better and smoother fonts and better screens. But testing shows that really good
    fonts with really good smoothing increase reading speed by about 5 per cent. That
    may add up over a workday, but it isn\u2019t make-or-break. And most people cannot
    alter, let alone improve, their workplace reading environments. There\u2019s little
    we can do for this group.</cite>\r\n\r\n<strong>On this conclusion I disagree.
    It might be possible to find better solutions by thinking a little \"out of the
    box\"</strong>\r\n\r\nJohn"

    of hardware we use to read said web page.\r\n\r\nIn the end, large text-heavy
    documents are really best served on paper. It's just a better medium for the content.
    That might slowly change with the increase of reflective based screens and portability
    (ie, the Kindle). But the benefit of the Kindle is, not surprisingly, the fact
    that it's attempting to emulate paper.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the first paragraph,
    there does seem to be a gut reaction by management/directors/editors against scrolling
    online (WHY ISN'T EVERYTHING ON OUR SITE ABOVE THE FOLD!!!??? ;o) but research
    seems to indicate that people scroll vertically just fine.\r\n\r\nWhen dealing
    with clients, I often ask them what sites they most often visit. Without a doubt,
    they tend to be sites that have a ton of content that requires a lot of vertical
    scrolling (Amazon, Facebook, Ebay, Wikipedia, etc.). I've found that what we think
    is the right way to build a web page often isn't the same as how we personally
    use the web. "

    practice, this means you need to limit distractions to the full extent possible.
    Pull quotes\u2014so effective near the top of an article\u2014become a nuisance
    further down; many readers will find themselves unconsciously drawn to them, even
    when they want to focus on the text. Attention to the basic typographic details\u2014line
    length, a readable typeface, the right balance between font size and line height,
    appropriate contrast between the text and background\u2014can make the difference
    between a reader who makes it to the end of the article versus one who tires and
    gives up.\r\n\r\n<cite>Whitespace is not so much a luxury as it is a prerequisite.
    Every pixel of whitespace around the text can help the reader stay focused instead
    of wandering off. A readers\u2019 eyes must repeatedly approach the edge of the
    text block; a sidebar that is set too close to the text\u2014or one that is brighter
    or darker in color\u2014will compete with her on every line. Even a small increase
    in padding between text and sidebar (especially if the sidebar includes more text)
    can make for a more restful page, and reinforce the reader\u2019s own sense of
    solitude.\r\n\r\n<cite>It\u2019s also important to consider the chronology of
    the reading experience. The initial transition from looking to reading is followed
    by an intense, concentrated period in which the reader is lost in the text. At
    the end of a piece, however, the reader once again comes up for air, and is likely
    to return to the state of looking (and browsing) that got her here in the first
    place. The design of the page should respect these three distinct phases: first,
    by inviting the reader in; second, by leaving her alone; and third, by providing
    avenues for her to continue to pursue her interests."

  body: "David, your last comments suggest that you think we disagree, which would
    be a pity, because I don't think we do, at least not about the nature of the problem.\r\n\r\nWe
    have a situation in which the variables on the client side are so numerous and
    of such kinds that design, occurring on the publisher side, cannot hope to provide
    optimum readability because design is not able to address or, indeed, even to
    know which variables are \u2018in play\u2019. This is the current situation. You
    have suggested a method to push beyond this situation, which is to provide separate
    outlines tailored to at least some of those variables, but of course the other
    half of this solution requires mechanisms for software to identify the addressable
    variables in play and to call the appropriate outline set. I think this would
    be pretty cool, but I'm not holding my breath, because it is contrary to the direction
    in which all the major software developers are pushing. [Insert denouncements
    here.]\r\n\r\nAside from the implementation issues, I'm not convinced that this
    method, which would certainly improve the situation, fundamentally alters it:
    there are variables of screen gamma -- almost certainly one of the factors making
    Roger's white-on-red text difficult for me to read -- and variables of individual
    perception that are not programmatically addressable by the mechanism of tailored
    outlines. And so far as they are addressable, just how many sets of outlines is
    it reasonable to produce? And given that new variables are being created all the
    time, how many new sets of outlines for the same typeface will need to be produced
    to keep up with the variables? And given that all this development costs money,
    won't customers simply choose to settle for less-than-optimum readability simply
    because it is cheaper?\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while, when I'm in a bookshop and
    find a book that I think I might like to read, I discover that it is so badly
    typeset or printed that I don't buy it. As I'm regretfully putting that badly
    produced book back on the shelf, I usually reflect that if I had the opportunity
    to re-typeset that book, I would be able to read it. And that is pretty much my
    experience of the Internet too, with the difference that I <em>can</em> change
    the appearance of the text of electronic documents, and optimum readability --
    which is a phrase that only has meaning on the display end, on the reader side,
    not on the design end or the publisher side -- is ultimately only achievable by
    me for me. This isn't as easy as it should be, and it is becoming more difficult,
    not less so. One the the principle benefits of electronic text is that it doesn't
    have a fixed form, but this is apparently not seen as a benefit by many designers,
    who want to control the appearance of text even though they have no way of knowing
    what I, the recipient, am actually seeing.\r\n"

    fundamentally indivisible from client requirements, even when it comes to electronic

    \ So perhaps I\u2019m just grumpy about letting other people tell me how I must

    thing: removing the dancing baloney, stationary baloney and faux navigation. E-book
    devices, and the iPhone e.g., do the same thing and profited from it 'till now.
    But as long as a bulk of users sit in front of Windows machines having appearance
    dictated to them, people will feel compelled to do studies, make other devices
    and move it along ahead of Windows. With or without dancing baloney, there is
    still type to read.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, they say \"Ignorance is bliss!\", and I guess that's true, since I've
    been wandering along blithely unaware of this  particular flamewar until Mike
    Duggan sent me the link...\r\n\r\nPlease excuse this fairly long posting.\r\n\r\nThe
    folks who've criticized the pages on my website: http://www.billhillsite.com/
    don't seem to have read the caveats in the content. I didn't claim these pages
    were great - or even readable - on all browsers on all platforms today, even though
    they were all created using Web-standards markup.\r\n\r\nThe awful screen shots
    which a couple of the posters to this thread have shown are the direct result
    of not having the right fonts on the system. They are, indeed, very ugly.\r\n\r\nThe
    pages were designed as examples, to prove to myself and anyone who took the time
    to read and follow the instructions that it was possible to create Web pages which
    can approach the readability of print using Web standards markup and good fonts.\r\n\r\nThey
    were created to explore a way forward, not to be compatible everywhere today.
    So they do currently have to be viewed in the right setup.\r\n\r\nThey were built
    using Notepad++ on a 1440 x 900 MacBook Pro, running Internet Explorer 8 on Windows
    Vista, and were designed to be viewed FullScreen, to remove all other distractions.
    \r\n\r\nThey use Embedded OpenType fonts, which work only on Internet Explorer
    so far (that's a whole separate flamewar). I'm not certain, because I haven't
    tried them in earlier versions of IE, whether these pages will work exactly right
    there. IE has supported EOT font embedding in all versions since 1996, but the
    pages use CSS 2.1 and CSS3 markup, and while IE8 has seen huge improvement in
    this area, earlier versions of IE may not render properly. I didn't explore this
    in detail, because as I said I'm looking forward, not back.\r\n\r\nYou can pick
    up RC1 of IE8 from: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/beta/.\r\n\r\nIf
    the fonts don't render correctly on any page, try hitting refresh - there's a
    bug (now fixed).\r\n\r\nHowever, because the fonts used are the ClearType-optimized
    ones which shipped with Windows Vista and Office2007/MacOffice2008, they also
    view properly on other browsers if they have those fonts. I believe you can also
    get them by downloading the Office2007 document compatibility pack for Microsoft
    Office 2003.\r\n\r\nI've tried the pages in FireFox, Safari and Chrome, and they
    work pretty well if you are running any of those on Windows Vista. They ought
    to work if you're running on Windows XP with Office 2007 installed, or on a Macintosh
    with MacOffice2008. But I haven't tried, myself.\r\n\r\nIn all those cases, the
    right fonts should be in your system without needing the downloadable EOT font
    objects, and the pages should render the way they were intended - especially now
    that Safari 4 on Windows is using native Windows rendering to get much better
    text. \r\n\r\nI know there are people who will disagree with that last statement,
    but personally I've always found Apple's sub-pixel rendering too blurry for sustained
    reading. IMO, Apple's rendering gives results which are closer to the character
    shapes of fonts when printed, but at the expense of clarity and edge-sharpness
    at body text sizes (the critical sizes for reading), at which we use hinting to
    snap edges to high-contrast sub-pixel boundaries and thus gain some sharpness.
    In this case I believe obedience is just a little blind, because we don't yet
    have the screen resolutions for it to work properly.\r\n\r\nTo see the full pages
    to best effect, your display needs to be 1440 x 900 or better. Currently Safari
    (and Chrome) appear to have no way to take a Webpage FullScreen and get rid of
    all chrome. FF uses the same F11 shortcut as IE.\r\n\r\nThere are occasional glitches
    with the multicolumn layout on a couple of pages (especially in FF, perhaps I
    used the CSS3 standard markup and not the \"moz-\" specific version). \r\n\r\nThe
    multicolumn Javascript I found on the Web is a bit of a hack really. Since it
    uses the Document Object Model (DOM), its lowest level of granularity is the paragraph
    element in HTML.\r\n\r\nThat means when it has to break a long paragraph at the
    bottom of a column, it has problems deciding exactly where. In fact, you couldn't
    possibly do it properly at that level - you need to be able to get down to the
    granularity of the individual word, or hyphenated word-part.\r\n\r\nTo overcome
    that problem, I've had to do some creative copy-editing. That's not tenable for
    real-world pages, but was OK for examples.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't expect to have this
    problem at all once native multicolumn support makes it into all the browsers,
    and the composition engines - which are a lot more sophisticated than that Javascript
    - are making the column-breaking decisions. Of course, the engines will also have
    to paginate the content - multicolumn \"reading\" content without pagination makes
    little sense, except for single pages with a limited amount of content.\r\n\r\nElsewhere
    in my pages, I express regret that at this time they had to be designed for a
    fixed size. The Web really needs a more dynamic, adaptive layout system. It can
    be done; I've seen it in proprietary formats like the New York Times Reader and
    what Adobe has shown recently. I've also seen it done in HTML, but it's not mainstream
    yet. \r\n\r\nThis kind of layout will need an entirely new approach to design,
    new HTML markup (probably) and certainly new tools. We've been designing for fixed
    spaces since the first cavemen painted on walls. But there's no such thing as
    a \"fixed page size\" on the Web, and we need a new design paradigm.\r\n\r\nDesigners
    have done their best to drag the \"fixed-space\" design paradigm into the new
    world, but it doesn't really work. Examples I've seen so far of so-called \"liquid
    layout\" in HTML don't fully do the job either.\r\n\r\nTypophile is the kind of
    forum in which we could really have meaningful dialog about all these issues;
    it's a huge body of collective knowledge and smartness, and I'd love to see civilized
    discussion, debate and disagreement here.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not interested in a flamewar,
    rudeness, bad manners, profanity, or any of the other behavior seen all too often,
    which is why I don't monitor these discussions all the time.\r\n\r\nIf people
    really just want to have a war, they can have it without me. But I'll try to respond
    to all civil postings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    magazines, books, and billboards are not surrounded by blinking Flash advertisements
    and they aren\u2019t blasting megapixels of bright white light horizontally at
    you as you sit bolt upright in your office chair.\r\n\r\nI know Joe disagrees
    with my approach, but maybe that's my fault and I've failed to clearly explain
    my thinking. Because I agree completely with his criticism of Web page distractions
    (and the white light, too), and that's what I'm trying to address in my own way.
    \r\n\r\nA single narrow (therefore readable) column of black text on a white background
    is painful to try to read onscreen, because there's far too much white blasting
    out at you from the rest of the display.\r\n\r\nThat's why I use white text on
    a black background in my blog:\r\n\r\nhttp://billhillsblog.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nWhite-on-black
    is not ideal. However, I found it to be the best compromise option for me on Blogger.
    I tend to write longer pieces. As soon as readers get down below the first screen,
    they end up with one narrow column of text and nothing else on the screen. I tried
    alternative templates, but ended up choosing the white-text-black-background because
    it gave the best contrast without blinding readers.\r\n\r\nIMO multi-column text,
    especially if it has good word-spacing (which requires hyphenation), can tone
    down the \"blasting white megapixels\" enough to be made comfortable. When typographers
    talk about the \"color\" of a page, they don't mean yellow or blue, they mean
    the comfortable uniform \"grayness\" of well-set text, best seen when you blur
    your eyes.\r\n\r\nIf you want someone to read comfortably, nothing on the screen
    can flash, or move. But adverts can be beautiful without that.\r\n\r\nI'd like
    to sit down and talk with Joe for a few hours sometime. I get the feeling we might
    have a lot more in common than he thinks.\r\n\r\n"

    obvious ones can be (screen, print, projection), and two of those three need not

  body: "John: \"...if he specifies type in pixel sizes he\u2019s an idiot.\"\r\nperhaps
    I'm misunderstanding, or know a lot of idiots then, I think we all do. \r\n\r\nPart
    of the 'new paradigm' is that objects are often specified as a portion of the
    units-per-page, and not as a portion of an inch, or any other old-paradigm measuring
    system \u2014 type is one such object. Point size, though useful in part of the
    old paradigm, was part of a sizing system based on arm length, age, and static
    pages of static content. Inches took over when the type sizing of the old paradigm
    was based on leg work, weather and dynamic pages of static content. And now we
    have all these measuring systems in the new paradigm.\r\n\r\nBut onward. There's
    sense in 'improving' how people specify type size, sense in disapproving bad type/background
    color schemes and sense in barking at adjacent distracting content. Where's it
    go? To specific apps that strip text content from a page and only present text?
    You still want to render better text. Everyone can huddle around the unchangeable
    facts. Then, you still have to render better text. Search Google for 'white pixels
    blasting my eyes\" = 0. Search Google for 'blasting my eyes' with 'computer screen'
    = 171. The whitest blue of the sky above is hardly blasting people.\r\n\r\nThere
    are hundreds of different searches you can do on similar combinations sleuthing
    for the white pixel demon, and many of them find 1,300 to 1,700 matches (not thousands).
    Search on 'fuzzy text' with 'windows machine' and hundreds of thousands of matches
    are found. It is likely that a proportional number of Mac users feel and express
    the same. And yet, there are billions of users of white backgrounds \u2014 billions.
    \ Where's it go? To a specific function that colors text to the user's desired
    preference. Then, you still have to render better text. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of which...\r\n\r\nBill:
    \"But there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201Cfixed page size\u201D on the Web,
    and we need a new design paradigm.\"\r\nIt's hard to imagine anyone believing
    this more than I do. Buy while the additional font technologies required to address
    this new design paradigm languish in committees with no intention of moving anytime
    soon, don't you think it should be possible to replicate that old paradigm trivially
    to the extent possible in the new technologies? Despite the wonderfulness of the
    new technology, shouldn't I be able to set a pretty darn good Gutenburg Bible
    right here? The mother DNA comes before the chicken or the egg, much less the
    western omelet you desire.\r\n\r\nBill: \"... because we don\u2019t yet have the
    screen resolutions for it (CT) to work properly.\"\r\nThat is one way of putting
    it, 'it's the resolution's fault' ;) Another way is that Microsoft did not develop,
    (and patent(s)), a font technology suited for reading in the resolution spectrum
    employed by the then existing and now continuing bulk of users of desktop computers
    running XP, Vista and Windows 7. It's not nice to fool mother patent office.\r\n\r\nBill:\"...we
    use hinting to snap edges to high-contrast sub-pixel boundaries and thus gain
    some sharpness.\"\r\nOne of my porcupinionated points is that if a type designer,
    or someone skilled in the word-making arts, does not have control over where that
    'some sharpness' is in the forming of words, what does getting the rest 'right'
    get for you, (lines, ppgs and columns), (leaving colors and surrounding content
    out of it for now)? You still have to render better text. \r\n\r\nExcuse the long

    <em>perhaps I\u2019m misunderstanding, or know a lot of idiots then, I think we
    all do.</em>\r\n\r\nBy 'specifies type in pixels' I mean using the CSS px unit
    to specify size. The reason this is an idiotic idea is that a pixel is a non-scaleble
    object of variant size, i.e. not-all pixels are the same size, so if you specify
    the size of something using px it will be a different size on different monitor
    resolutions. So, for example, specifying 13px as a font size will result in anywhere
    from 13pt down to less than 5pt depending on the monitor resolution.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the CSS reference guides I've looked at classify px as a \u2018relative\u2019
    measurement unit, in contrast to \u2018absolute\u2019 measurement units. In fact,
    px is a unique kind of measurement, not truly relative because it cannot be scaled,
    and not truly absolute because it does not have a fixed size."

    a px as it'll relate directly to the other visual elements on the displayed page
    (ie, images).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, AFAIK, most browsers have no idea what my PPI

    that's what raster imaging is all about: converting scaled vector graphics or
    type specified in absolute non-pixel sizes to appropriate pixel sizes and patterns.
    The key is that the conversion happens relative to the pixel resolution of the
    output device, i.e. at the display stage where that information is available to
    the rasteriser. This is all very sensible. What is not sensible is a designers
    specifying pixel sizes independent and ignorant of the resolution of the output

    are 1/145 of an inch, and some are 1/200 of an inch. And that's just enumerating

    [I haven't calculated the ppi of my new monitor, but I reckon it is somewhere
    around 120ppi. For most of the past five years I was using a 145ppi screen (Dell
    laptop), and before that a 133ppi screen (Toshiba laptop).]\r\n\r\nSo the question
    I have for web designers is 'Would you knowingly spec 6.5pt type for your main
    body size in a book or newspaper?' And I guess the answer is no. But that's what

    could hit ctrl-+ on every page to increase the type size, but readers shouldn't
    have to do that.\r\n\r\nDavid thinks I'm elitist because I buy screens with higher

    when I say that readers \u2018know\u2019 how big the pixels they are looking at
    are, I don't mean they know the exact dimensions (nor do they have any need to
    know). I mean they know how big they are in the same way that you know how far
    you are from an object, because you are experiencing that space directly. Readers
    know how big the pixels on their screens are because they are looking at them:
    they know that they are <em>that big</em>."

    should be able to get that information from the system, but failing that, getting
    it from the user is a good idea. The UI was quite nice, because it didn't require
    the user to actually know what the ppi resolution was: all he had to do was measure
    a line on the screen with a real ruler and enter the length in a box in inches
    or mm. From that, the browser would calculate the number of ppi and could accurately
    scale any inch-convertible unit such as typographic points.\r\n\r\n<em>If a browser

    If type is spec'd in points, one knows exactly how big it is going to be in high
    res print, and one knows fairly accurately how big it is going to be in low res
    print despite visible rounding. The printer type doesn't need to be spec'd in
    dots, because the output device knows how to accurately rasterise e.g. 10pt type
    to an appropriate number of dots for the resolution of the device. And we think
    this is normal and would be shocked if it didn't work, if nominally 10pt type
    were a radically different size on different printers because they were all presupposing
    a resolution that was different from their actual resolution. But somehow we've
    accepted a situation on screen, despite using the same fonts and an entirely parallel
    raster imaging rendering model, in which we think it is normal and acceptable
    for the text layout to be ignorant of the resolution of the output device."

  body: Joe, the CSS spec defines px is 'pixels, relative to the viewing device'.
    So, yes, it is a relative measurement insofar as it is not an absolute measurement
    in the sense that a centimetre is an absolute measurment, but on any specific
    viewing device the actual pixels have a fixed dimension, so the px measurement
    becomes absolute at the moment something sized in px is displayed on a particular
    device. A 600x400 pixel graphic on my screen is a fixed size; if I zoom or otherwise
    enlarge the graphic, it is no longer 600x400 pixels. Of course px-specified text
    can and should be scaleable, but when it is scaled, like the image, it is no longer
    the number of pixels specified; so what we're really saying is not that px is
    a relative measure in the same way that e.g. em or ex are relative, but that the
    px measurement may change relative to scaling values. But in the same way that
    one cannot know e.g. how big 13px will be unless one knows the ppi resolution
    of the particular viewing device, one also cannot know what is an appropriate
    scaling factor for px-spec'd sizes. Yes, px-spec'd type can be scaled, but the
    reader is the only person involved in the publishing and consumption of a web
    page who knows <em>how much</em> he needs to scale px-spec'd type in order to

    web page who knows how much he needs to scale px-spec\u2019d type\"\r\n\r\nActually,
    that's true regardless of the measurement the designer chooses. The issue is that
    they are all relative measurements in reality. \r\n\r\n(All of this is ignoring
    IE <= 6, of course ;o)"

  body: "@ both Dan and John: I can't stand zoom, either. And I LONG for absolute
    measurements.\r\n\r\nThe human eye doesn't know from pixels. The fovea is 0.2mm
    in diameter and has a resolution of 600 dots per inch - whether you're from Bangor
    or Beijing. Those two measurements, plus the reading distance and the reader's
    personal preferences or requirements, drive everything about creating readable
    text. They're all absolutes. \r\n\r\nWe need enough information so the browser
    can convert pixels (on the specific device) to absolute measurements, then take
    into account user preferences, too. I did a quick poll recently, and found that
    where average reading distance for print is 50cm, for screen reading it was clustered
    around 60cm - but some folks read as close as 30, others as far away as 75.\r\n\r\nMore
    evidence that a new design paradigm is needed. Today, the designer has control
    over the HTML and CSS. But she has no idea of the characteristics of the display
    on which the content will be viewed, or the reader's preferences (which should
    be honored).\r\n\r\nThere's no longer an unbreakable connection between designer
    and display, as there was in print. And only the browser can have access to ALL
    the information needed to make final layout decisions. I hope that scares everyone
    enough to think hard about the problem.\r\n\r\nBTW, Joe Clark's right. Critiqued
    as \"real-world Web pages robust enough to work anywhere\", the pages I created
    are a joke. You could drive a bus through the holes in them, pick apart the execution.
    There are loose threads everywhere. Mea culpa, mea culpa!\r\n\r\nI don't care.
    They weren't built for that purpose. But I've had users report they read the book
    on screen for a couple of hours at a stretch (and went back later for more), and
    I could happily read a 40-page article myself without giving up in disgust. \r\n\r\nThey're
    not an end, only a starting point. I'm headed somewhere."

  body: "\"...one cannot know e.g. how big 13px will be...\"\r\nJohn, the question,
    is no longer how big 13px will be, because the majority of users select from \"small'
    and \"medium\", don't they? Point size is disappearing from the web user's experience,
    replaced by your type getting larger if you're 'on' smallest and 'select' smaller.

    px is displayed on a particular device\"\r\n...on a particular device a pixel
    becomes absolute to a size once displayed! to the web page upon which it certainly
    must sit, it is a relative measure!\r\n\r\nBill Hill!?, the eye knows pixels or
    one would not need to enumerate the distances we choose from each device. \r\n\r\nWe
    have enough information from the monitors to get size back to normal, it has been
    there for a while. We need a font permitting table, variations and extra-contextual
    substitution in a standard font format (with hints interpreted or at least if
    non-interpreted, documented by all), compliance to this standard font format by
    all browsers (a standard display technique for all browsers independent of OSs
    'd be nice:)). All must use @fontface. We need web authoring(?) to transition
    to presentation of a narrower and denser range of better-rendered text sizes to
    choose from (how long is this bit gonna take?), and a fruit salad with a tiny
    glass of ancient port on the side. \r\n\r\nIt'll be a fine day when those things
    are accomplished, 'cause that, and a few FB fonts, will make Hill's web site readable.\r\n\r\n\"I
    hope that scares everyone enough to think hard about the problem.\"\r\nHow scared
    would one have to be, to repeatedly-beyond-count (2005-2008), tell one of one's
    biggest clients, that the client was full of beans?\r\n\r\nDan and John: \"I can\u2019t
    stand zoom, either.\"\r\nYou obviously don't like Pan either then? And do neither
    of you carry an internet porthole on your phones?\r\n\r\nAluminum: \"if [] designing
    specifically for the iPhone, [then] you have a [] fixed canvas to deal with.\"\r\nYou
    are aware that it zooms and pans? Perhaps you mean to say, that if one is designing
    a non-internet app for the iPhone one may have a fixed, or a dual-fixed (port.
    & land.) canvas to deal with? Part of this, however, is true of all displayed
    content everywhere if the page's description(s) is/are capable of reacting to
    the page's dimension(s) dynamically. But in the end, the definition of 'reacting'
    is really based on how well the type composes and recomposes.\r\n\r\nI've only
    seen both zoom-happy content and dual purposed layout happening consistently with
    good type on the Apple Macintosh iPhone. One hope we've all pointed to, and I
    reiterate for possible effect, is that little high res web devices get cheap fast.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    designers and font designers and so on, but no amount of complaint or avoidance
    will change the fact that HTML marks up the structure of your content (there are
    rules for such markup), CSS defines its presentation, and the user has absolute
    control over the outcome. Absolute. \r\n\r\nIn typical cases, \u201Cuser\u201D\_means

    the font size at will. (Totally blind people don\u2019t care.) \r\n\r\nThe Web
