body: "Hello,\r\nI\xB4m a student and i need help with a Logo. \r\nIt is for a group
  of people, who fight for printed products (against e books, online newspapers etc.)
  This group is not real, i invented it. The Logo combines a fist and a book. Some
  people I asked could not see the book. I made another version in which you can recognize
  the book better, but it is not as aggressive as the first attempt. I want it to
  be aggressive. \"Druck\" means \"Print\" in german.\r\n\r\nCan you think of a way
  to make the book better recognizable in the first attempt? Or do you see other mistakes
  I made? \r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance and excuse my bad english."

    to make it more book-like\u2026 And find a better typeface than Frutiger Black
    (by which I mean no disrespect towards that excellent typeface \u2014 but something
    more unique and special would be nice)."

  body: "This is my new attempt. My Problem: I really have to use the Logo in yellow
    with black background. And I think the last logo works better with this colors.
    Am I wrong?  And I am sorry, but I have to use the Frutiger. Thanks again for
    the help. \r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Druck_3_4603.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Druck_4_3818.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Druck_5_6216.jpg]"

  body: 'Works for me (top one). I like how who used the centerfold to define the
    thumb. There is a small issue with the line thickness, it looks like there is
    change there 4/5 up the vertical. You should look into the various relations re
    thickness of all the elements. Attention to detail! (Quote L. Mies von der Rohe:
    God is in the details.)'

  body: Yes, you are very right. There is a variation. The vectors are not that neat
    as they should be. I will change that. Thank you very much.
