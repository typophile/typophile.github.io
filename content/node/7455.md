  social influence. Though conrtoversial, I chose Tupac Shakur. I believe he is misuderstood
  by many people, specially by the older and conservative group of the society because
  of his unconventional approah to expressing his fears, anger, hope, and other feelings.
  <BR> <BR>Now I am in the explortory phase and I am reading a lot about him. However,
  i might appreciate any assistance on approach that would make his believer happy
  and his critics more open. I am collecting words that describe him. Here are some
  of them: <BR>controversy, ultra-masculinity, rough, soft, thug,  activism, poverty,
  god, urbanism, fast/speedy, tension, contradiction, unstable, self-destructive...
  <BR> <BR>Here is his site that i got most of his information from: <a href="http://www.2paclegacy.com/"

  decide on a direction or conceptualizing is really appreciated... <BR> <BR>TC'

  body: On top of everything, he was a voice, a poet and a philosopher. So maybe a
    typeface that reflects his ability to express his views while balanced with some
    regularity to reflect his rhyme and reason. If that made any sense, what I mean
    is, utilizing some wild graffiti tag elements here and there  &#40;overcoming
    adversity&#41;, but held intact firmly by some charachteristics of a classic typeface?
    A bit of challenge I&#39;m sure, anyway, I thought some input from a fan might
    be helpful. <BR> <BR>Nice link Scott

  body: When you try to put too much &#34;character&#34; into something essentially
    utilitarian like a font, you run the strong risk of coming out with a caricature.
    Try instead for subtlety, of a <i>hint</i> of Tupac. <BR> <BR>hhp

    mori&#39;&#41; is a theme represented in hip hop as well as in baroque. so why
    don&#39;t you look at baroque fonts like Adobe&#39;s Caslon...

  body: Check out Emigre&#39;s Priori for what I believe is a nice blending of character
    and utility. <BR> <BR>Granted, it has many variations within it, but that may
    just be the point. <BR> <BR>I assume that novelty/titling fonts are probably the
    aim here, rather than a true text face.

  body: 'Hi everyone, it seems like i have a lot to write about for not responding
    ontime.Thanks everyone for your input. <BR> <BR>Scott, thanks for the cool link.
    Actually, there is a small book which consists word illustrations: <BR><a href="http://wordsatplay.com/"
    target="_blank">http://wordsatplay.com/</a> <BR> <BR>Raja, I like the idea of
    having a mixture of a classic typface and wild graffiti characters. Would be interesting
    to see the expected and unxpected qualities of them, it is kind of like hinting
    one thing over another like Hrant says. I&#39;m his big fan too, thus why I am
    taking the risk of showing it off to conservative designers, while many are doing
    traditionl ones. <BR> <BR>Thomas, &#34;Glamour, wealth and beauty in the presence
    of death&#34; nice keywords. I&#39;ll look into them.  <BR> <BR>Chris, Emigre&#39;s
    Priori has some features that relate to tupac as well. I like how the letter &#34;t&#34;
    looks like a cross that tupac has on his back and he refers/hints it/God in a
    lot of his poems. That&#39;s a cool tip. <BR> <BR>This class goes a little slow
    at the begining as we have to research a lot. But, I&#39;ll make sure to update
    u with the approaches, progress, and results. <BR> <BR>Thanks U all!! <BR>Tseggai'
