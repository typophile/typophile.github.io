body: "A couple of years ago I saw a video that I wish I would have bookmarked of
  a European design software ( I cant remember if it was a plug-in or an actual program).
  I'm sorry I do not remember much but I do recall the guy narrating the video was
  demonstrating on some lettering and with a slider he was able to maniplutae the
  lettering in seconds that would take hours (I think it added flourishes or something).
  It was amazing but I wish I could remember more of it. Does any of this ring a bell
  with anyone. I know its rather vague, sorry.\r\n\r\n-Charles\r\n\r\n"

    did a calligraphy program, so it imitates the motion of a broad pen. But I don''t
    remember the name. '

    which AFAIK Fred has not released to other users. Charles might also be thinking
    of LivePen, a Windows-only pen modeling plugin for Illustrator that was purchased
    by FontLab and withdrawn from the market. "
