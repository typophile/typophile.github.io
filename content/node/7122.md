  Stephen Wright, noted type historian. <BR> <BR>I was curious to learn more about
  the guy behind Lines and Splines, Andy Crewdson. All I know is that he is a student
  at UC Berkeley and that his site is fantastic, a must-read for typophiles. Anybody
  know anything about his background? Very curious. <BR> <BR>bj '
