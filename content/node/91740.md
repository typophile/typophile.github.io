    of distressed is hard to do. Start with an effect and then find a common denominator?
    Go for it!"

  body: This looks fun, although it also looks like you started with Myriad to get
    here. I think you should remove most of the curves and make it more angular.

  body: 'The idea was something along the lines of creating a sans that had grotesk
    outsides, (what''s the opposite of a counter?), and sort of semi-calligraphic,
    though machine tooled looking, odd ribbony counters that seem as though they are
    trying to burst out of their shell(the outers?). '

  body: I think the cross bar of the lower case 't' is what I question the most about
    this font.  I think I worked out the overall stroke balance from glyph to glyph
    very well, and still managed to pack it full of extreme width differences.  I
    tired to have every glyph have a thinner form tying into a bigger, thicker, or
    if you like, bolder stroke, and not just a little bit bolder.  On top of that
    I wanted it to be incredibly readable, and on my humble inkjet printer, it's very
    clear at 6 point, and likely would be at lower sizes than that.  The overall tone
    and color of the text appears even, and yet when you look at it at good size with
    anything longer than a quick glance, you can't help but notice it is full of flavor.
