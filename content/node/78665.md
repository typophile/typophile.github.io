  body: "It's a font called <a href=\"http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/14905?text=like%20the%204thof%20july\">Written
    On His Hands</a> by Kimberly Geswein. This site is a great place for freebie scripts,
    and this was obvioulsy one of them, because it was clearly a make-your-handwriting-into-a-font
    effort.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it was on the 3rd of 39 pages of samples of handwriting
    fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
