body: "Hello, I am currently trying to create a logo for a construction company, but
  the name is so vague that I cannot think of any mark that is suitable. I have done
  all the conceptual work - mind mapping, sketching, word association, image searching,
  etc - but still cannot think of anything suitable.\r\n\r\nI think it may be partially
  because I am creating the logo for my father's business (note: I am a design student
  currently completing my Des BA) and thus I am too close to it, so now I ask you
  all for help with coming up with a suitable idea. It has been quite a challenge
  for me (frustratingly so as usually these things are not so difficult for me) so
  I hope you all can provide some insight be it a word, an image, a concept, a typeface,
  whatever you can provide.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate any help anyone could provide.\r\n\r\nThe
  company name is: Ceilings and More (note: the word \"and\" is spelled, not \"&\",
  and he is very adamant about that).\r\n\r\nThanks again everyone, I hope to be posting
  later with some critique of some kind of logo!\r\n\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nAPPENDED:
  attached is a digital sketch of one of my concepts. Any feedback would be greatly
  appreciated. Feel free to rip it and be as honest as possible too, I am not attached
  to it: it is just some of my work, it's not me!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ceilings_4963.jpg]"

    instead of having the letters\r\nsit on a baseline have them \"hang\" from the

    say it again - one can not be a design student or professional and not be able
    to come up with ANY suitable ideas.\r\n\r\ngenerating ideas and figuring out how
    to properly execute them is the essence of what you do. it would be more helpful
    if you showed some work, concepts, sketches - whatever it is - and asked for feedback.\r\n\r\njarrod\r\n"

  body: "Do you need to use all uppercase on the \"and more\"... maybe it's my time
    spent on the net, but uppercase tends to SCREAM too much for my taste -- especially
    when it's only used on \"half\" a logo.\r\n\r\nOverall, I wonder if the face (this
    is Galliard, yes?) is a little too \"middle-of-the-road\"... it has some nice
    curves, but it's also kind of angular. The squared-off dot in the \"i\"s would
    stand out more in a more organic, curved face. Maybe even Galliard Italic? On
    the other hand, a more modern/geometric/tech face would likely convey the \"industrial\"
    quality of the company (if, indeed, it is more of a B-to-B rather than consumer
    enterprise). \r\n\r\nThe overall letter spacing seems a bit open too, though I
    tend to subscribe to the \"tight but not touching\" school when it comes to logos
    and headlines.\r\n\r\nI kinda like the mark/dingbat, but it _is_ pretty generic.
    Maybe the ornate panel would work better _inside_ the box rather than outside,
    as you are selling ceilings, not exterior walls.\r\n\r\nI just keep thinking about
    how you could convey \"above-ness\" or \"overhead-ness\" in a design. Try to think
    of how others do it, like Travellers insurance (they've \"got you covered\" with
    an unbrella), or maybe look at roofing company logos. Don't steal, just get inspired.
    I keep (mentally) coming back to the ceiling of the Sistine chapel for some reason...
    the \"ultimate\" ceiling i suppose.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My first impression of the logo was that it'd be for an office supply company.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems unfitting to use a serif font for a construction company. Construction is
    mainly about robustness, not delicateness. Plus, the delicate aspect is already
    sufficiently represented by the ornamental symbol on the left. Therefore, a sans
    serif font should be more suitable here -- a tall and narrow one, if you want
    the text to have some elegancy and less massiveness.\r\n\r\nAlso, the two colors
    used are both a bit pale, which does not only enforces the \"more delicate than
    robust\" impression, but also could be problematic if the logo is used in single
    color situations. Have you thought about how a greyscale version is supposed to
    look like?"

  body: "Collin, here's my wandering thoughts on the subject...\r\n\r\nIt's a crap
    name and one of those banal and cheesey business naming conventions of the 1980's
    like World of Chairs, Worktops 'r' Us, Ovens Etc, Supadoors.\r\n\r\nBut it does
    have a quality you could play with. Think of it as two surnames and it sounds
    a bit like a business partnership from the 1800's possibly founded by Dr Samuel
    Ceilings and the Reverand Quentin More to promote, as they might have put it \"the
    edification of interior heavens\".\r\n\r\nCombine that with your father being
    \"very old fashioned/traditional\" and that he's probably been in the business
    for a good number of years now and you have a possible solution...\r\n\r\n...design
    it in the style of shop and truck signage from, say the 1880's to 1900, or any
    classic period.\r\n\r\nMake it a period study or revisionist exercise or parody
    or whatever by looking at font's and ornate embelishments / flourishes / devices
    from a particular era.\r\n\r\nHere's just one reference I found quickly... http://www.signmuseum.com/\r\n\r\nMaybe
    have the name in all capitals with a ceiling rose style graphic* between them
    for symmetry...\r\n\r\nCEILINGS * AND MORE\r\n\r\nYou could go with deep bold
    colours with strong contrast or blended natural tones and textures. Maybe even
    incorporate a \"SINCE 1978\" style phrase.\r\n\r\nBTW Does Ceilings need to be
    plural? Flooring tends not to be pluralised. Too late to change it I guess?"

    the time to comment, and so thoroughly too. Thank you all from the bottom of my
    heart.\r\n\r\nJon, I laughed at that \"More\" and \"Ceilings\" comment, but you
    know, it actually makes sense. And I think taking a more reverential approach
    may work well.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you all, everything said here has gone into
    the hopper and is going to result in something much better than this initial sketch."

    It has zero personality and is like naming a chain of grocery stores 'Food and
    more'. \r\n\r\nAny chance you can talk him into using 'Ceilings and more' as the
    tagline and go with a more logical company name? Even if it's something as generic
    as 'Smith Fine Woodworking' or the like.\r\n\r\nIf you must stick with the name,
    what about using a perspective plane representing the ceiling and an iconic rendering
    of your dad holding it up ala Atlas? (just throwing out ideas...) \r\n\r\n"

  body: I keep thinking about a circular logo for this for some reason, and I think
    mainly because of ceiling medallions. I think the more traditional look (like
    woodworm said) could be the way to go, maybe incorporating a ceiling medallion.
    If anything I hope this sparks more creative juices.
