  body: It is very similar to the exclusive type of Porsche, and may even be by the
    same person. Both Volkswagen and Porsche have paid for exclusivity on their fonts
    - not for the general public. I understand that an old Volkswagen (that look like
    Frankfurter) was released, but I still haven't seen it.  Don't know if this is
    a help to you or not, sorry for rambling. Hope you find it. If you are just looking
    for something similar - check out Science Fiction/Techno categories. If this were
    a typeshop, those would be the first volumes I'd have the guys pick up to start
    their search in.
