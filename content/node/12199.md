  on-line \u2013 currently growing off-line \u2013 in September of 2002, Speak Up
  is an author-based, reader-supported community devoted to graphic design open to
  conversation and dialogue. It stresses and questions the importance of the profession
  in our culture. Speak Up challenges those who practice inside the field, in hope
  of more accountability for their actions and in light of the responsibility we all
  have as communicators. Its mission is to further the graphic design profession from
  within with the goal of creating a stronger and clearer sense of what our role is
  as professionals endowed with the duty of creating social, cultural, political and/or
  economical communications based on our ability and obligation to do so in a visually
  clear and comprehensible manner. \r\n\r\nThrough interviews, discussions, reviews
  and supported by openness, honesty and immediacy, Speak Up strives to distinguish
  exceptional practices in graphic design that exemplify the importance and relevance
  of the profession as well as shed light on those that deteriorate it. By talking
  amongst ourselves (an activity continuously regarded as ineffective) it is possible
  to ascertain the significance and relevance of those practicing under the umbrella
  of graphic design. \r\n\r\nShaped by its authors, readers and random contributors
  Speak Up has grown into one of the most dynamic communities within graphic design.
  With its emphasis on an open dialogue it has managed to capture the attention and
  interest of the profession but more importantly has provided a forum and given a
  voice to otherwise unheard graphic designers. \r\n\r\nSpeak Up moves, grows and
  shifts in parallel with graphic design, rendering the participation of those within
  its most valuable advantage. It would not exist if it weren\u2019t for the graphic
  designers who choose to express their opinion and make their voices heard. In that
  sense, Speak Up embodies consistently and sinuously the ever-evolving profession
  that shapes the world\u2019s visual environment.\r\n\r\nAuthors: [[Armin Vit]],
