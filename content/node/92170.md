body: "I have a problem with a .otf font in Windows. I has been used in different
  MS Office applications where it worked fine until today, where it stopped working
  \u2013 I don't have more information from the client than this font preview image
  attached. They've tried to remove the font and reinstall it \u2013 still not working.
  The fact that it used to work but suddenly not, seems strange to me...\r\n\r\nAny
  clues?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image001_6438.jpg]"

  body: What I see is a font without a lowercase. Copy the uppercase characters into
    the lowercase slots, create new classes to algorithmically expand the kerning,
    generate a new font, and the problem will disappear.
