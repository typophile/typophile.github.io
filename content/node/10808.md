  body: Thanks for the quick input!  That looks good. <BR> <BR>Even before I posted
    I tried the Times New Roman on my machine which looked a bit heavier than the
    sample above. Maybe I have a poor version of that typeface. I&#39;ll check it
    again. <BR>

  body: The TNR I have here &#40;OpenType version that came with WinXP&#41; is a perfect
    match.

  body: Matt, I think the nature of low-res printers is such that any type you print
    often comes out a little heavier than it would be coming out of an imagesetter,
    though there are different versions of Times/Times New Roman out there.

  body: I wasn&#39;t printing... the final art will be for the web. The preview didn&#39;t
    look close... again it looked real heavy but I may have inadvertently had some
    text settings that changed the weight. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have to check it out
    tonight on my home computer.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Thanks for all the input everyone.
