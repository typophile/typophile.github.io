  are aware of the First Spiekermann Dictum? I imagine that anyone who's set more
  than a few lines of type has come across the phenomena where a descender in a line
  of type clashes with the ascender in a second line of type.\r\n\r\nAs written in
  Rhyme & Reason: A Typographic Novel, the dictum states the following:\r\n\r\n<img

  good stories on your encounters with the First Spiekermann Dictum? What would be
  your approach when it occurs?\r\n\r\n"

  body: My approach to these incidents is to rework the two lines so that the two
    touching elements look as natural as possible, blending together well. My one
    exception to that is if the touching is quite minimal, then I will rework the
    two lines so they don't touch.

  body: "When talking about the relevance of the First Spiekermann Dictum and guessing
    how often that occurs, we should remember that Erik stated it back in the days
    of phototypesetting. In the case of Erik and many of his professional colleagues
    in mainland Europa and the UK, this was typically done on Berthold machines. On
    these machines, all the fonts had the same cap height. As a consequence of this,
    the real body sizes varied. Type size was defined in mm cap height and line feed
    in mm. The Berthold type specimen specified a minimum line feed for each typeface
    in a range of sizes from 5\u201316 p for kp, \xCAp and Ex-height. Because not
    all typographers liked to calculate and write their typesetting instructions that
    accurate, but simply wrote things such as 10/10p, ascenders and descenders would
    touch when applying this instruction to typefaces such as Syntax or Futura. You
    can imagine that mistakingly touching ascenders and descenders were quite common
    in those days. The large phototypesetting chain of Eduard Bos in Holland tried
    to cope with this by advising so-called line feed factors for each typeface family.
    These factors were communicated in the specimen books of the studio as \u2018A\u2019,
    \u2018B\u2019 or \u2018C\u2019. Typesetting operators would then calculate the
    appropriate line feed from that factor. Remember that back then, there were no
    Wysiwyg screens with an accuracy that could display the difference between 10/10
    and 10/11 p \u2026 Of course, not all customers had these specimen books, let
    alone that they studied them thoroughly. Many of them learned by trial and error.
    Like me. Normally one would make such a mistake only one time because phototypesetting
    was quite expensive, but that one time was usually enough to make shure that you
    would never forget such a thing as the First Spiekermann Dictum in your life as
    a typographer \u2026"
