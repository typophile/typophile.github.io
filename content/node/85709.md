  click the magic emerald next to the Unicode name field in the rename glyph pop-up

  body: "It isn't an error so long as both Unicode characters are appropriate to the
    glyph. I have plenty of fonts with double-encoded glyphs, and even a few triple-encoded.
    You should bear in mind that some of FontQA's messages represent the in-house
    production preferences of a particular font foundry. I prefer Font Validator,
    which checks against the OT font spec, rather than against particular choices
    made from among equally valid options.\r\n\r\nThe only reason why you would deliberately
    want to avoid double-encoding is if you were aiming to provide a single path from
    glyph name to Unicode, which is something that Adobe and some customers like because
    it enables reconstruction of text strings from raw glyph IDs in PDFs distilled
    from print streams. But this is a particular application issue, and not a font
    format requirement."

  body: "@ John - you're right.\r\n\r\nFor some reason when I fixed a couple of other
    errors tonight, this error went away, so aparently FontQA no longer cares if I
    have double encoding.\r\n\r\nI have now gotten FontQA to come up with no more
    errors. I feel great.\r\n\r\nI plan on using Font Validator too. As soon as I
    install Windows on my bootcamp system on my mac.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."
