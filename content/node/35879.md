  I am looking for a font for a client.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wallpaperfromthe70s.com/\r\nIt
  concerns the text: \"Wallpaper from the 70's\"\r\nWhat font is this? It looks familiar
  to me but that's about it....\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n"

    target="_blank">Deftone Stylus</a> a freeware font. The numerals appear to be
    enlarged from the original font, which is why they appear bolder...
