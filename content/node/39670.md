body: This is Datum, my first attempt at a font. It's a display face in which the
  letters are made up of bits of grids. It's not perfect, I know, but I'm not sure
  just how to improve it. Any suggestions?

    you could try justing using the rectangle shape to build the letters, instead
    of having all the little bits. "

  body: "The thing that grabbed me immediately was how the stems of pairings like
    UM, ON, MN, etc blend together and make those letters difficult to read.  Not
    sure if is helpful but your font reminded me of some of the sandblasted lettering
    in the Toronto Subway system.  In that case the grid kind of manifests itself
    within the medium to give a (similar?) effect. Might be worth checking out for
    some more ideas.\r\n\r\n(There are some photos in Joe Clark's recent article on
    type in the Toronto Subway..\r\nhttp://joeclark.org/appearances/atypi/2007/TTC/inscribed/)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Okay, I've doubled the inter-character spacing, so it should be more readable.
    I'm not sure if it's enough, but as the creator of the font, I'm probably not
    the best judge of that. I've attached the results as datum-v0.2.pdf.\r\n\r\n<em>Maybe
    you could try justing using the rectangle shape to build the letters, instead
    of having all the little bits.</em>\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure what you mean by
    \"the little bits\"--the little rectangles that all the characters are made out
    of, or the smaller rectangles on characters like C and G? Could you please clarify?\r\n\r\nFinally,
    does anyone have any ideas about how I could improve my Q? I think it could use
    some improvement, but I don't know just what to change."
