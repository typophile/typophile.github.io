  body: Not Avenir, the &#39;a&#39; in Avenir doesn&#39;t have the little curl at
    the end. Similar otherwise. Today Sans has the curly a but also has a curly u,
    and the g doesn&#39;t match. <BR> <BR>I hope someone IDs this, it&#39;s pretty.

  body: I googled and found this. I wonder if the css on your machine isn&#39;t dictating
    the typeface? Or am I over-simplifying the problem. <a href="http://www.stewartbrown.com/text_factory_surplus.html"

  body: How on EARTH did you track this down from that sample? <BR> <BR>I wish my
    computer dictated something that nice, it&#39;s a lot prettier than Arial or Verdana.  <BR>
    <BR>Reminds me of Cronos too, but that&#39;s a knockoff of Today I think and has
    some differences.

  body: closest we&#39;ve seen but not quite there. It isn&#39;t as round &#40;see
    the c and the g&#41;. The f is different too &#40;more like Avenir&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>This one is really bugging me!

    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/abadi-mt/</a> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    pretty close, and I&#39;m thinking, since this is a scan of a printed piece -
    maybe this is what Abadi would look like if it were printed, and it bled a bit.
