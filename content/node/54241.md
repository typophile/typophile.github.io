  designed by Cranberry from the mid 1970s. This design comes across as a mixture
  between Post-Structuralism and Graphic Design. The colors and gradient really is
  what drew me to this particular design. It really seems to be the evolution of mixing
  typography and pop art in the same design.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lichtenstein_Drowning_Girl_5144.jpg]\r\nThis
  design is from the Pop Art Modernism period. This must be where they got the comic
  book style from. That was the one thing I have noticed while doing my research.
  Being a illustrator as well, this design caught my eye because of how it reminds
  me of the style of design I am accustomed to.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Freidman-1971_5478.jpg]\r\nThis
  design is from a more typographic period. It stresses the design of type and displays
  the varieties of type design as well. One thing that I really like about this design
  is the contrast. It puts more emphasis on the type and plays down every thing else."
