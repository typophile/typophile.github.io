  body: I'm not sure it's the graphic designer's fault. The advertisement was submitted,
    but for some reason the newspaper didn't have the correct fonts - only demo versions
    with missing letters. Or there was some kind of corruption of files or data transmissions.

  body: I've seen a similar problem when viewing a PDF in an older version of Adobe
    Reader that was generated by CS4. I don't remember exactly how we prevented it
    from happening though :( I think using a different PDF/X standard fixed it, not
    sure which one.

    fonts for an ad, especially when submitting it to newspapers - they're notoriously
    old school.

    I figure the wrath of the clients and bosses, plus mockery of millions of newspaper
    subscribers, is punishment enough. It's from a HUGE New England newspaper (I'm
    visiting relatives.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is definitely the designer's fault, although
    I doubt it was done by a designer. My guess is that these ads were both done by
    the newspaper's advertising sales department and tossed into the layout at the
    last minute. \r\n\r\nI used to work at a fairly large newspaper, and there's no
    way this would've gotten past layout. It was a constant battle between the sales
    team and the graphic designers (layout); sales would keep trying to sell spaces
    that layout had used filler ads for.  Layout would put a page to bed, go home
    for the day, then the sales team would persuade the printer to swap out a filler
    ad for a paid ad. \r\n\r\nI clipped it out to use as a cautionary tale. THIS is
    one of the many reasons it's worth it to pay a professional designer!"

    of tight deadlines. With (monthly) magazine publishers and commercial print shops,
    you typically DO see proofs.\r\n\r\nAnd, during my most recent stint in a print
