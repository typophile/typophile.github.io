body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI looking for a special font that is not related to any knowed
  langages (russian, japaneese, chineese, etc). Also I am not looking for any comics
  font here. It has to be something \"regular\". \r\nIt has to be \"like\" what we
  all know but has to have no relation with any possible meaning.\r\n\r\nThe purpose
  of this font will be for an animated  \"scream' of a young caracter in an animated
  serie. So font that offers to much squared symbols or elfique feeling may not fit
  my need.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny sugestions welcome.\r\nThank you."

    of my all-time favorite unusual scripts is Naxi Geba:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/naxi.htm\">omniglot</a>,

    also a winner. I learned it a few years back, and know a few other people who
