  body: "Oh, darn the IE that I'm forced to use at the moment. My lengthy comment
    went AWOL when I hit the preview button. Again in very short words:\r\n\r\n<strong>1)</strong>
    Skyline and Lake Michigan form the torch. Beautiful, simple, smart.\r\n\r\n<strong>2)</strong>
    I certainly associate the torch with the Olympic Games.\r\n\r\n<strong>3)</strong>
    Second hint to the Olympics: the color scheme of the logo (yellow, red, green,
    blue plus black and white) reflects the color of the Olympic rings emblem.\r\n\r\n<strong>4)</strong>
    As I see it, the TM could only be made smaller (onscreen) if you don't want people
    to be able to decipher it.\r\n\r\n<strong>5)</strong> I can read <em>Chanel</em>
    instead of <em>Chicago</em> any time I want to. Beat that.\r\n\r\n<strong>6)</strong>
    The five colors reflect the five continents: might be a myth. Pierre de Coubertin,
    who studied arts, founded the IOC, revived the games and designed the Olympic
    emblem in 1913, said that while the rings reflect the continents, their colors
    reflect the entirety of the world's national flags; at least one color of every
    ensign could be found in the Olympic flag."

    bid cities aren't allowed to use the Olympic rings until after the national Olympic
    committee has officially sanctioned the bid. (e.g.: See the <a href=\"http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1078.pdf\">2014
    Candidate City Guidelines</a> from the IOC site, p. 32). In the U.S., that won't

    then</a>.\r\n\r\nBTW, here's a look at the <a href=\"http://38one.com/cleverblog/place-your-bid\">logos

  body: "Oh, and to answer the original question, Chicago-based <a href=\"http://www.vsapartners.com/\">VSA
    Partners designed it</a> pro-bono, and you'll be happy to note that the \"TM\"
    gets smaller in the version on their site. Their explanation of the logo's elements:\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    Chicago 2016 logo is styled in the shape of a torch and consists of three distinct
    visual components. The flame, in the shape of Chicago\u2019s skyline, reflects
    the international significance of Chicago architecture and speaks to the vitality
    of a city that rose from the ashes. The body of the torch merges a color palette
    that represents the blue of Lake Michigan with the vibrant green of the city\u2019s
    park system -- further underscoring Chicago\u2019s commitment to the environment
    and sustainability. Together, these visual elements evoke the spirit of the Olympic
    Games and its values. It also evokes Chicago\u2019s Games concept, to host compact
    Games celebrated in the center of the city, along the Lake Front and in the city\u2019s
    parks.</cite>"

    but a mess. NY and Paris are kind of trite but effective for what they are. I
    like the liberty/athlete combo in NY. London is hideous and Madrid is absurdly
    subtle and looks like a bloody gash. None are as nice as the Chicago logo.\r\n\r\nMy
    info on the significance of the colors of the rings came from watching a broadcast
    of the opening ceremony some time ago. I was appalled.\r\n\r\nI am soooooo glad
    NY didn't get the 2012 games, last thing we need."
