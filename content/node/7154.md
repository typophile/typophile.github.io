body: 'Hi there peoples  <BR> <BR>I am pretty new to this site - but as i understand,
  you can get some really good feeback. <BR> <BR>Which is basically my reason for
  this post... <BR> <BR>The situation is like this : i am designing a 30 page booklet
  that is targeting 12 - 17 year old males. The problem that i face is - weather to
  use Univers for the main body copy and find a font that is quite expressive for
  the titles  <BR>OR  <BR>Should i just use univers for the whole booklet ?  <BR>
  <BR>I know that its not really good to mix and match typefaces but i feel / fear
  that the booklets type might look a bit stale - so to speak. <BR> <BR>When I say
  stale i mean the type becomes very percise and lacks the visual characteristics
  that help relate the subject content to the audience. <BR> <BR>Hopefully that makes
  sense to everyone. <BR> <BR>And hopefully you could give me some advice that might
  help me. <BR> <BR> <BR>thanks heaps  <BR>eye_mac'

  body: Univers is not suitable for body copy, but your choices are endless. <BR>
    <BR>Have a look at CDs, computer games, and magazines targeted at teens. Most
    would not feature Univers.  <BR> <BR>Having said that, 12-17 year old males are
    as varied as any group. Good, attractive design should be your goal. &#40;Although
    I&#39;d probably steer clear of flowing calligraphy for this group.&#41;

  body: Aaron, to get a better feel for the type can you tell us a little about the
    content. Is it a science book, sports that sort of thing. I agree with John, lots
    of Univers is not suitable for text. There are alot of type designers here that
    will give you better choices.

  body: I agree, Univers is a poor choice both because of readability as well as atmosphere
    - sorry.  :-&#40; <BR>Something like Eidetic &#40;which has a serif version called
    Neo and a sans called Modern&#41; might be good. <BR><a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/specimens.html"

  body: If you&#39;re targeting 12-17 year olds, aim at the 15-17 year olds and the
    younger ones will follow. Univers probably isn&#39;t the best choice, particularly
    if it has to carry the weight of the booklet&#39;s image. It&#39;s not a great
    font for lengthy running copy, but it&#39;s not as though you&#39;re setting the
    thing in an illegible novelty font. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re set on Univers for
    the body, I&#39;d definitely add some life with an interesting titling font. By
    the way, try out Univers 45 &#40;light&#41; for the body copy. With the right
    handling, I prefer it over 55 &#40;regular&#41;. Without specifics on the content,
    I can&#39;t get more specific on the fonts.

  body: thanks to all those whom have replied - i appreciate your expertise - very
    much. <BR> <BR>And just to answer the question about the body copy - well its
    about nutrition etc - its designed for sporting kidds between 12 - 17, like i
    saud earlier. <BR> <BR>Well with all that was said - i think its back to the drawing
    board - i did not know that univers was such a poor type - its such a large family
    and is often talked about in the design / typography books.  <BR> <BR>Its interesting
    - thanks again

  body: There&#39;s nothing wrong with Univers per se, it&#39;s just that it might
    be a little too corporate/clean for this audience.  <BR> <BR>But if the booklet
    isn&#39;t too copy heavy &#40;2-3 paragraphs per page&#41;, you could get away
    with Univers for body copy, pairing it with &#40;as others have suggested&#41;
    a more expressive headline face. <BR> <BR>You certainly wouldn&#39;t be the first
    to use Univers as a text face. Take a look at Wired magazine, which uses the regular
    and condensed versions for most of its body copy.

  body: In saying that i have been thinking of using either a house industries font
    OR Dogma, which you guys would know is an Emigre font -  my feeling is that they
    are very expressive kinds of typefaces so thought they would be a break from the
    univers &#40;condensed &#41; that i am using... <BR> <BR>what are you thoughts
    on those typefaces ? <BR> <BR>Have i just broken every rule in the design / type
    manul - <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: The following fonts are from small, independent designers and foundries, yet
    the quality is first class. Beware of settling for Univers. Save it for the annual
    report &#40;or not&#41;. All of the following collections offer fonts that are
    at least as hip as Emigre &#40;more in my opinion&#41; and have less exposure.  <BR>

    - The printed samples look great with all caps in display and text set at 7pt.
