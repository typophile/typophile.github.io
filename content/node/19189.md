body: "Howdy Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI was referred here by Mike Yanega, Bowfin Printworks.\r\n\r\nIn
  early 2005 I designed a website for a client using\r\na PC running windows 2000.
  \ In the interim I have learned a\r\nvaluable lesson in web design - always document
  your\r\ncolor schemes and font choices.\r\n\r\nRecently I was forced to upgrade
  my OS to XP and\r\nfailed to document my collection of Fonts.  Then of\r\ncourse
  the customer called out of the blue requesting\r\na site change... DOH!\r\n\r\nSo
  my dilemma is, I have searched high and low all\r\nover the net and have not been
  able to find the font\r\nused at http://www.jimsweetwater.com \r\n\r\nThe font is
  used all over the home-landing page and is\r\nalso employed as the font for the
  text buttons and\r\nheaders on the sub pages.\r\n\r\nThe font is characterized by
  open (unclosed) lower\r\ncase a, b, d, e, g, & p.\r\n\r\nIf you can help ID this
  font I'd be truly grateful.\r\nI need to create new text buttons and without this
  font I'll \r\nhave to recreate every button on the site.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nTreblemaker\r\nSF,
  CA\r\nhttp://www.WorldWideTed\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hehehehe, you can always rely on Nicolai. Not always present, but when he
    pops out of the woodworks it's usually bullseye. Nice catch, dude. :^)
