body: "Hello, this is my first post here. I am looking for a typeface that looks stitched,
  or sewn. I thought I found one but when we contacted the designer he said he had
  not finished the face. His name is <a href=\"http://tbad.ca/\">Tom Brown</a> and
  we saw his work in an old issue of Communication Arts. The attached is a screen
  shot from his site. I would have just linked to it but since it is Flash based thought
  this was safer.\r\n\r\nWe don't need an exact duplicate so any suggestions of nice
  faces with a similar feel would be appreciated."

  body: Hi John, a quick search at Fontshop for the word <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=stitch&site=d&btnG=Go">stitch</a>.
    Are any of these close?

  body: Miss Tiffany thanks for the quick reply. No, I did search for stitch & sewn
    at fontshop (and several others) first but none of them have the same line quality
    and organic feel we are looking for. Thank you for the help though.

  body: The strangely named '<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/blhd/conference-call/">Conference
    Call</a>' is the closest I can get. It's not as subtle as your sample, but it's
    of the same style.

  body: Don't know if this is of any interest for you, but the stitched typeface in
    your sample actually is [[Adrian Frutiger]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=vectora&x=0&y=0&sample_text=Night&sample_size=36">Vectora</a>.
