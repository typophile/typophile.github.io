  font called LMS Hippy Chick. My boss wants me to do a 1960s-themed layout and had
  a sample of something pretty close to this, but I need to use figures, and the font
  I've downloaded is pretty sketchy and has none.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for fonts
  like this, or even if I can find a more complete version of this font somewhere?
  Canada Type's Doobie is close, but a full version of this Hippy Chick font would
  spare me having to appliqu\xE9 flowers by hand..."

    the 1960s without piling clich\xE9 upon clich\xE9.\r\nThere are many \"hippy\"
    fonts that you could work with.\r\nFor instance, why not use Mojo in Illustrator,
    bending it to resemble a Wes Wilson poster?\r\nAlternatively, cue up Live Dead,
    take a couple bong hits, and start drawing.\r\n"
