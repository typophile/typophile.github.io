  Garamond from Adobe. I have printed two pages: the first with kerning on, the second
  with kerning off (Character Properties). I can''t see any difference... Why? '

    click on some selected text. Go to the character spacing tab. Next to the the
    box that you check to request kerning, you will note a box where you specify the
    the point size at which Word 2007 starts to apply kerning. Did you choose a size
    small enough to include the point size you are using? If this does not work are
    you certain that your Simoncini Garamond from Adobe has kerning?\r\nDon"

    question: why is kerning off by default in Word 2007? Is there any drawback of
    kerning?"

  body: "> but at this point I'm not sure Simoncini Garamond from Adobe has kerning\r\n\r\nIt
    does. Not vast amounts, but it has kerning. You can look at some specific combinations
    that usually involve substantial kerning to check, such as:\r\nTo Te\r\nLTAVA\r\n\r\n>
    Is the Simoncini Garamond from Linotype different?\r\n\r\nIt may be. Adobe originally
    supplied all their versions of fonts they licensed from Linotype back to Linotype,
    both originally in Type 1 and later in OpenType conversion. But Linotype has since
    updated some/many (all?) of them. You would have to ask Linotype. Perhaps one
    of their folks will comment."
