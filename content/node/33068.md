  Accel-A-Writer 8300</a>. I am not too sure of the best way of connecting it to my
  iMac G5, not very sharp in these areas! The printer has LocalTalk, Serial, Parallel
  & SCSI ports. Are USB to Parallel connections reliable, for example? \r\n\r\nAny
  help would be appreciated! Thanks.\r\n\r\n\u2014K\r\n\r\n"

  body: According to the pdf, the printer has ethernet. That is the best way to connect
    it. You may need a router if you're already using your ethernet port for the internet.

    ordered in over here. I was meant to, but the morons at the store ordered the
    wrong one\u2026I's hoping there'd be an off the shelf fix for this.\r\n\r\n\u2014K"

  body: "I don't know what that is (AUI Connector) but if you can hook it up thru
    ethernet that's definitely the best way. I tried some workarounds with an old
    Apple laserwriter that didn't have ethernet and it disabled some of the printer's
    capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe pdf in your link made it look like it had a regular old
    ethernet port. You should be able to find an ethernet cable pretty much anywhere."
