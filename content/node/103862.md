  body: You could get most of the letters by adding flourishes to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-quorum/|ITC
    Quorum Book or Medium]]. You'd have to fabricate the elaborate <strong>F</strong>
    and <strong>Y</strong> and the numerals, unless you can find matches in other
    fonts.

  body: "This is a wonderful reminder of an era when architects, at least in Paris,
    had the pride to sign their buildings. One of the things I remember fondly from
    walks in streets in the XVI arrondisment is buildings of the pre WWI era with
    these inscriptions. No two were identical. As for the inscription, this is lettering
    not a font. The capital F is a nice Tuscan style.  Something similar to it is
    found in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/frisco-antique-display-sg/\">Frisco
    Antique Display</a>, although the font lacks the art nouveau flowing lines of
    the inscription.\r\nDon\r\n"
