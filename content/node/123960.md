  to some technical limitations in how/where it'll be applied, but I'm having a hard
  time with the punctuation, so I began wondering if there are any good examples of
  typefaces with inline punctuation.\r\n\r\nI haven't yet come across a comma that
  doesn't go bellow the baseline but is still readable, have any of you perchance?
  \r\n\r\ncheers!"

    though most of those don't really fit the \"nothing bellow the base line\" criteria.
    I'll keep on looking and will report any finds :-)\r\n\r\nI'm still looking for
    any specific examples of good inlinepunctuation someone might know, though!"

    Hardwig just pointed me (via twitter) to these marks as an alternative for inline
    forms of punctuation:\r\n\r\nRaised comma (or short virgule): https://flic.kr/p/dXHL4U
    \ \r\nMiddle dot: https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=U%2B00B7\r\n\r\nI'm considering
    including these as an stylistic set, and just including more traditional forms
    of punctuation as a default..."
