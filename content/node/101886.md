body: "Hi, Typophilers,\r\n\r\nI use mac and word 2011. Sometimes I place directional
  arrows into word documents to indicate direction or flow and was wondering. In the
  fonts I am using, I can see that they have encodings for the following:\r\n\r\nU+2190
  arrowleft\r\nU+2191 arrowup\r\nU+2192 arrowright\r\nU+2193 arrowdown\r\nU+2196 arrowupleft\r\nU+2197
  arrowupright\r\nU+2198 arrowdownright and\r\nU+2199 arrowdownleft\r\n\r\nWhen I
  use the symbol inserter (see screen.png) a symbol is inserted, however, it is not
  from the font I am using, rather wingdings (see word doc.png) . Is there a way to
  get word to recognise the font, or shortcuts that can override the limitations?
  I have already tried double hyphen lessthan ( --> ) to make a right arrow, however,
  this creates another type of arrow that is not editable (it does not appear to be
  part of any font).\r\n\r\nThanks for the help."

    \ In the following grab, the top line is the Wingdings obtained from the Word

    viewer. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/charview_4460.png]\r\n\r\nI selected
    the unicode range, to be sure the characters are in the font, but you get a larger

  body: "Don't mean to hijack the thread, just generalize it a bit.\r\n\r\nAre you
    guys saying that \"modern\" (Unicode) versions of MS Word may get a character
    from whatever font it decides to, regardless of whether or not that character
    is in the font selected by the user for the document?\r\n\r\nSo, for example,
    if you need a  d with underdot, and both the U+1E0D character (from the Latin
    Extended Additional set) and the combining diacritic U+0323 are in the font you're
    using, Word might decide to go and get the character (or string) from a different
    font?\r\n\r\nExtending that, are their any circumstances when Word might change
    the Unicode assignment of a character, deciding something should be a \"symbol\"
    even if the Unicode number for, say, a spacing modifier or combining diacritical
    has been keyed, or is in a file keyed by someone else?\r\n\r\n"

    think it can be done with the character viewer that comes with 10.8.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nare
    their any circumstances when Word might change the Unicode assignment of a character
    [Charles]\r\n</blockquote>\r\nI don't think so. So far as I know, Word will just
    use some fallback mechanism to display the missing characters instead of displaying
    some \"missing glyph\" symbol.\r\n\r\nWhat happens with the Word symbol inserter
    is that, at least in the case of the arrows, it is programmed to insert symbols
    from Pi fonts, not unicode symbols. Here is what happens if I write in Word the
    first line with Cambria, copy and paste it underneath, then select the second
    line and select Bauhaus 93\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arrows_3585.png]\r\n\r\nFor
    the first arrows on the second line, Times new roman was used as fallback font;
    for the last four, Dejavu sans bold was used. I don't know how those choices are
    made."

    body: "@PabloImpallari\r\n\r\nI was thinking about it too. But why Word prefer
      Times New Roman to a sans-serif font as a fallback to Bauhaus 93? It doesn't
      make too much sense.\r\n\r\nOf course, if one of these 3 fonts lack proper PANOSE
      information, that could be explained easily."
