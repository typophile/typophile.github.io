  my features within FL Studio.\r\nNow I tried building the kern feature with FDK,
  but still I'm getting an overflow. No mixing up different scripts within the classes
  and also kerning should not be too much (3400 pairs, when expanded 152k).\r\n<em>GPOS
  feature 'kern' causes overflow of offset to a subtable (0x11a00)</em>\r\n\r\nAlso
  there's quite a lot of this stuff:\r\n<em>Pair positioning has two different values
  in 'kern' feature; choosing the smaller absolute value: Q comma</em>\r\nwhich seem
  to be my exceptions.\r\n\r\nAny idea?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nChris"

    -- no 'by' in pos commands.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\r\n\r\n<cite>which seem to be my exceptions</cite>\r\n\r\nLooks
    like there is something wrong with classes: one glyph appearing in more than one
    leftside class, or in more than one rightside class. I think you should check
    your class definitions first.\r\nAbout 3400 kerning pairs <cite>may be</cite>
    (but not necessarily are) critical. If you generate fonts with AFDKO 2, you can
    also try to kick out lines with \"subtable break\" and add an explicit lookup
    definition with 'useExtension', so your kern feature looks like this (please exchange
    parentheses by braces):\r\n\r\nfeature kern (\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lookup
    kern0 useExtension (\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pos A
    B 12;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pos B C 32;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
    kern0;\r\n) kern;\r\n\r\nBut mind that FLS5 cannot compile this, and that such
    a kern feature will be interpreted only by a few OT-savvy applications like those
    of Creative Suite."

  body: "If you are having problems resolving class conflicts, here's what works for
    me.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kern1_5402.png]\r\nFirst, select
    \"class kerning\" in the metrics panel.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kern3_3773.png]\r\nThis
    has several benefits, one of which is to highlight class conflicts in red.\r\nHere,
    v and c are the master characters in their classes, and y is included in the \"v\"
    class.\r\nTherefore, when I attempt to apply a different kern value between y
    and c, FontLab marks it with a red number warning.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_3947.jpg]\r\nThis
    value is also listed in red in the kern pair table at the right of the metrics
    window, enabling one to scroll throught the entire kern pairs in a font, looking
    for conflicts."
