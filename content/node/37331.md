  decided to open source a bunch of code that I have written for various type development
  tools. You can learn more at [[http://code.typesupply.com|code.typesupply.com]]
  You might find the [[http://code.typesupply.com/wiki/FontLabScripts|FontLab Scripts]]
  and the [[http://code.typesupply.com/wiki/FeatureProof|FeatureProof application]]
  to be particularly useful.\r\n\r\nIn other news, I launched a new Type Supply website
  at [[http://typesupply.com|typesupply.com]] and started a blog at [[http://talleming.com|talleming.com]].\r\n\r\nThat's
  all for now. Have fun!"

    I have no idea. I haven't used Python in FL 4.6 in a long time. They work in FL
    5 on my Mac.\r\n\r\nIf you figure out what causes the crash, please let me know
    and I'll tweak the scripts."

  body: "\r\nHi Tal!\r\n\r\nThank you so much for releasing these small tools as free
    software!\r\n\r\nThere are two areas of your svn that do not have the MIT/X11
    license though - http://code.typesupply.com/browser/applications/FeatureProof/trunk
    & http://code.typesupply.com/browser/applicationScripts/FontLab - and although
    \"\"THIS SCRIPT IS SUPPLIED AS IS. NO WARRANTEES. NO GUARANTEES. NO QUESTIONS.\"
    has a certain sense of humour to it, it is non-free :-)\r\n\r\nI hope you can
    spare a couple of minutes to update the license of the code in these directories
    :-)\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nRegards,\r\nDave"
