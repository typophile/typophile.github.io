  2 by 'Without Walls'. I'm reluctant to pay huge shipping cost from USA. It is a
  DVD full of really nice grayscale tiffs of nice wood type letters.\r\n\r\nWe're
  currently working on a project that requires some genuine looking wood type. Trying
  to recreate o wood type effect using photoshop just doesn't do it! \r\n\r\nOr if
  anyone could suggest an alternative I'd be grateful!"

    to a local printer to create some proofs for you. It might be quite viable price
    wise, plus it's the real thing. "
