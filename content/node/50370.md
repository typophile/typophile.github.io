  looks like Impact, but isn't quite.  It was used on this 1977 series, and I believe
  it matches a typeface used on the Kovacs shows from 1961.  What is this?\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

    is it, judging by the \"hook\" of the top of the lower case \"a\" etc.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nBen\r\n\r\nwww.silentfilmmusic.com"
