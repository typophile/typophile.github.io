    There a lot of confusingly similarly named fonts - Janson, Jenson, Johnson etc..."

  body: "I know Jensen Oldst and Arabique are way far from what i looking for:) Thos
    are the only ones coming up when i try to find it.\r\n\r\nWell, I cant really
    be totally sure the name is correct. But I read an article in a design magazine
    on how they remade a newspaper. In this they replaced the former DIN with \"Jensen\".
    Ofc they can have made a typo there. So I might be looking for a Jensen-similarly
    named font that looks like DIN maybe:)\r\n\r\n/10W"

    a picture of the replaced page head in the article. The head was written all in
    caps, and it was very similar to DIN mittelschrift. But it seemed like the \"S\"
    was a little more like Akzidens Grotesque.\r\n\r\n/10W"
