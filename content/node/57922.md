body: "I have 5 books of poetry all set in fonts preloaded into open office, but seeing
  as I am re-editing them i wish to change the fonts from my adobe font folio package\r\n\r\nthe
  poetry has a calming, melancholic effect, the feeling of watching snow fall in street
  lights glow, the poetry is similar to classic poetry of ts elliot and sylvia plath
  but with urban themes\r\n\r\nand I would be grateful of suggestions of fonts that
  might inspire a similar effect\r\n\r\nthnak you\r\n\r\n\r\n"
