    and it matched up pretty well. That's what happens when the original font is manipulated,

    I'll report you to the font police, or at least let Arthur Baker know so he could
    give you a good spanking! ;-)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but you young whippersnappers need your bottoms whacked!"

    lengths to render his picture unrecognisable... :^P
