    something nice for dinner. The owner greeted him and told him to look around.
    The cannibal began to inspect the meat case and noticed the market specialized
    in brain. \r\nUpon further inspection he noticed a marked disparity between the
    costs of brain meats. A carpenter's brain sells for $1.50 per pound. A plumber's
    brain sells for $2.25 per pound. He noticed with alarm that a politician's brain
    sells for $375.00 a pound. With not a little curiosity he asked the owner why
    the huge difference in price between the similar meats. \r\nThe owner responded
    with a deadpan look on his face, \"Do you realize how many politicians it takes
    to get a pound of brain?\""

    scary libertarian. I don\u2019t want to even consider the possibility of another
    President who\u2019s clearly detached from reality. The same goes for Guiliani,
    who actually seems to be buying into his own hype. \r\n\r\nI think I\u2019ll be
    stuck bearing the Obama standard. He still freaks me out with his belief in fairness
    and his tendency to talk about religion more often than some of the crazy fundie
    candidates, but aside from that he seems to have his head pretty well screwed
    on in the Bill Clinton sort of way. "
