  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The forums have been acting quite strangely in the last few days. I'm certain I've already posted this thread. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, not having illustrator or and equivalent has me trying to create fonts using pixels for now. Until I get a computer (soon, hopefully) this is what it has to be. Unless, someone knows of a workable and free alternative to illustrator (or freehand for that matter) for drawing outlines. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, here is what I have been working on until I can turn it into a conventional font using a program such as illustrator. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I guess try to imagine it as not being a bitmap. I suppose that using paths will totally change its appearance, however. Well, this is it for now. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Chris</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Christopher, if you have access to a machine running Linux then Inkscape and SodiPodi and Skencil some to mind. These are vector drawing prgrams. To me Inkcape is the most comfortable (I'm an Illustartor user for most of my regualr workaday employment). If you don't have access to a computer then none of these will really help. Also on linux for free is Font Forge for drawing and making fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But really, what with the other stuff you have shown here and in the other categories, I'd keep going down the bitmap road and feel good about it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Steve, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thankyou very much for those links! I've felt absolutely paralysed having no means of designing anything.  There seems to be a shortage of the G5 I want; I'm stuck on my Dad's PC. Well, back to the drawing board with a vengeance! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just this evening I began work on another pixel font, with a few greys for added precision. Spacing pixel fonts properly (even when you are making them in phoshop itself) is damn-near impossible :-S.   Quite fun, though. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Me and my little brother are working on some HTML compositing ideas. He has made up a system where you type a word and it will set that word using the font. However, the future of this seems grim where the typeface is not monospaced. hmm. more on this later. Watch this space. Or, well the pixel threads, perhaps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, hi there Kris. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I managed to find myself a 20&quot; iMac amidst big waiting lists all over the place. Told them to hold it, then they got six calls and 2 customers wanting to buy it, within few hours. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've been sketching a few things recently; i'll find myself some web space and perhaps put up a few pages. After seeing the &quot;A Ghost is Born&quot; I saw the modest mouse things coming a mile away! I like the &quot;the good times are killing me&quot; one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My brother has finished a basic version of this pixel font composition. It has the ability to add ligatures (which is essential with the troublesome spacing associated with pixel fonts). More on this later, especially since I've only made a lower case font for it. Caps is on the way. &ndash; I just had a suggestion for him regarding ligatures&hellip;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think you are right about the skeleton thing; if I am going to design in a conventional manner then I should most likely &quot;keep it real&quot; and put pencil to paper. I think I just get a real kick out of pixel-pushing. Er, rock on. Or something. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- on another note <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Does anyone know of a free alternative to suitcase? I cant stand it moving my fonts to those giant communual system font folders. I shoudl find a font previewer perhaps&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Chris</div>
