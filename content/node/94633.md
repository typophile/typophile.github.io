    be a bit wider too.\r\n"

    minuscles, both to help its function as \u201Csentence markers\u201D but also
    because they are bigger and have more white inside them. The latter makes the
    black seem thinner than it really is.\r\n\r\nAscenders often benefit from being
    slightly taller than capitals. IMO, yours would. Now they look smaller.\r\n\r\n/h/
    join (and similar shapes) look too heavy. I would thin the joins.\r\n/e/ crossbar:
    too heavy. Next to h it looks like it has too little overshot on the baseline.\r\n/q/
    the top curve looks out of place\r\n/q, u, i/ there is something wrong with the
    heights here. q appears smaller than u. I take it the /i/ is lowered to make room
    for the tittle, but IMHO this doesn\u2019t work as intended. Its tittle is also
    too small.\r\n/c/ the straight-to-curve connection looks uncomfortable, and it
    also appears to get heavier towards the terminals. Internal white vs. black not
    in harmony,\r\n/k/ the weight of the diagonals are off. The top one needs to be
    lighter, the bottom heavier (at least towards the baseline). One of the hardest
    letters to get right.\r\n/b/ internal white not in harmony with other shapes.
    Needs thinning of joints.\r\n/r/ too wide. I would start with thinning the joints
    of /n/, and flipping its \u201Cnotch\u201D (where the curve meets stem) 45 degrees
    to serve as the basis for a steeper shape.\r\n/o/ looks heavy in the \u201Ccorners\u201D
    (NW, NE, SE, SW). Intended? If so, this should reflect in the other shapes as
    well.\r\n/f/ the lowering off the crossbar may work, but your overhang is sloppy
    like spaghetti, making the whole thing look weak\r\n/w/ is too heavy, especially
    in the joins\r\n/x/ very unbalanced. The top looks amputated. Needs cross compensation
    with the diagonals\r\n/s/ give the internal white the same attention as the black.
    As of now, they are not in harmony. \r\n\r\nIn general, I think many of the shapes
    look like they come from different designs. You need to work on harmonizing the
    curves. They shouldn\u2019t be exactly the same, but look like they are made with
    the same tool, at the same angle and the same writing speed. \r\n\r\n"

    that's embarassing!  Thanks for the correction, and thanks to whoever else tried
    to correct me before.\r\n\r\nFrode Frank, thanks for the great review, I will
    have to start digging into this.\r\n\r\nThe r was originally thinner, or at least
    the arm didn't stretch out as far.  After seeing it in some words however I felt
    widening it made it echo the b d g p and q better.  Perhaps the lowercase r is
    not supposed to echo these letters however?  I don't actually know if they are
    or not, it just felt like it should here.\r\n\r\nI extended the width of the f
    as well.  It's strange but true that if it extended up to normal ascender height
    it would look too wide as is, but in it's current shortened state, it just seemed
    to need to be wider.  I would guess this has something to do with the 'mass' or
    black around that area of space in neighboring letters.  That is, if it extended
    up to normal ascender height, there's not much other ink in other letters up that
    high, especially as the cross stroke makes it a lot darker than say, the h.  So
    because there is not much to compete with it, it can be thinner while looking
    wider.  In its present shortended state however, the top of the f is competing
    with a lot of other information, so I had to make it wider.  Thats my theory anyway,
    I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nThe b d p & q...  Not sure exactly why you think the
    top curve looks off.  I have seen other p's and q's  with a smooth top and no
    element there.  Am I doing it wrong?  Perhaps I should flip the b d p and q vertically
    and use the shape with the element protruding out as the p and the q, and use
    the smoothed over shapes for the b and d?  Also, I made the width of the d a little
    bit wider than the others.  I did this because basically I thought I was supposed
    to.  Isn't the lowercase d supposed to be the widest of these forms?  Maybe they're
    not.\r\n\r\nI totally see what you mean about the baseline part of the f.  Yes
    it is a lot farther off than I had noticed.\r\n\r\nI think I will leave the i
    and j as they are.  I feel they look a bit too short, yes, but if I want cap height
    to match ascender height (which I realize is not standard of course, but it's
    what I want to do with this face) I'm not sure if I could balance it out any better,
    perhaps you know a way?  I tried the lowercase j with no tittle, just extended
    it up to cap/ascender height.  That didn't really look quite right either, and
    it still left the problem of the i.\r\n\r\nOh, and Ricardo, you are right, the
    h is <em>definitely</em> to thin.\r\n\r\nThanks to both of you again for the help!\r\n\r\n"

    original idea, but at this stage I think your concept is the biggest problem:
    it is not well considered. Look at similar designs! How do they make similar shapes
    work together? How do they treat the white? What tricks are they using to fix
    optical problems like for example black spots?\r\n\r\nThe other big issue is that
    you\u2019re only (mostly) looking at the black parts. You need look at the white
    as well! Balance the white inside and between letters, and also the relationship
    between white parts in letters like /a/, /e/, /s/, /g/ ++. Take a look at the
    /s/ for example: the top and bottom white are totally different shapes.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll

    this is because I'd like to see this font be a bit idiosyncratic, which to me
    is the only way it can easily get some attention.* For example I'd leverage your
    gargantuan x-height - make the descenders shorter! And I think making the caps
    <em>x-height</em> might make this thing become special. And maybe make everything

    alternative angle BTW is to try to make this fit a very narrow niche: truly tiny
    type. I'm talking on the order of 3 point. It could become useful/famous that
