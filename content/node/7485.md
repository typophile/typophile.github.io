body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I know this isn&#39;t nescessarly type related but it is design
  related. Do any of you gals or guys know of a London based Graphic Design Online
  Community. I&#39;m thinking of moving there and just wanted to talk to people about
  this. While I&#39;m at it, this is for all you Londoner&#39;s what&#39;s the job
  situation  like their. I&#39;d be moving from a well respected company in these
  parts so I&#39;ll be armed with an excellent CV an pretty decent Portfolio. <BR>
  <BR>Cheers

  body: Marvin, <BR>There are jobs available although there are a lot of applications
    for each vacancy and they are not all in London. The best places to look are Design
    Week weekly &#40;<a href="http://www.mad.co.uk/publication/dw/" target="_blank">http://www.mad.co.uk/publication/dw/</a>&#41;
    and The Guardian on Monday and Saturday &#40;<a href="http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/"
    target="_blank">http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/</a>&#41; or online nb. design week
    requires registration which you can have for a free trial period. You will need
    samples of print items, pdfs are not always acceptable, nearly all job vacancies
    require samples of work to be sent with your application. There are also temp
    agencies like <a href="http://www.workstation.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.workstation.co.uk/</a>
    who have full/part time vacancies and freelance work. Aquent was reckoned to be
    one of the best but I have had no experience of them <a href="http://Aquent.co.uk/"
    target="_blank">http://Aquent.co.uk/</a>. <BR>Good luck <BR>Tim
