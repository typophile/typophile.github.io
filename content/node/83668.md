  Mac that I absolutely need to use on my PC for some engraving (have to match something
  in a catalog). I have been trying for two days to copy this font over but without
  any luck. The font file description even says it's a Windows True Type Font. But,
  every time I move the font to my PC the file size comes to be 0Kb....no matter HOW
  I DO IT...but the file size on my Mac starts out around 78Kb.\r\n\r\nI have tried
  the following with no success:\r\n-emailed the font\r\n-used DropBox to transfer
  the font\r\n-compressed the font into a .zip file\r\n-compressed the font using
  StuffIt into a .sitx file\r\n-copied font onto a thumb drive to transfer\r\n\r\nI
  tried searching on the internet for suggestions but everything I read is either
  outdated, deals with different font formats then what I am trying to copy, or is
  something I have already tried.\r\n\r\nWHAT AM I DOING WRONG?!!!\r\n\r\nANY help
  would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n-Jon"

    get it from?

  body: You are putting it into the windows/fonts folder, yeah? Because from what
    I remember, font files on windows pc's (.ttf/.otf whatever) are tiny, meaningless
    files if you put them elsewhere, until you drag them into the fonts folder and
    windows reads and installs them there and they become useable. That's probably
    an obvious comment, but you never know, windows can be weird at times.

  body: 'What''s the file suffix? If it''s TTF (Windows TrueType font) it should work.
    If it does not have a file extension, it is a Mac TrueType font, which cannot
    directly be used on Windows, no matter how you transfer it. '

  body: "Whyawhelk: eh? :) (Is it possible you are confusing fonts with zipped files?)\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    font file description even says it's a Windows True Type Font.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhere
    does it say so? Some file descriptions are generic, i.e., based on the file name
    but not on the file contents.\r\nPerhaps this is not a Windows Truetype font but
    an older version of Truetype, which can only be used on a Mac. The file size of
    0 Kb seems to point to that -- the actual data resides in the Mac specific \"resource
    fork\", a portion of the file that Windows has no access to. Compression and mail
    software is rigged to honour that, even when opening on a system that does <em>not</em>
    use resource forks, which boils down to \"the entire world minus Mac OS\".\r\n\r\nIf
    that's the case, you cannot use the original font file on your Windows machine
    and you have to convert it from a Macintosh Truetype format to Windows Truetype
    format. If the EULA of this font allows it, <a href=\"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/macformats.html\">Fontforge</a>
    might be able to convert it.\r\n\r\n[Edit]\r\n\r\nOn further reflection: you could
    try and see what happens when you copy the Resource Fork part into the 'regular'
    part of the file. For that, you need a binary editor such as <a href=\"http://www.suavetech.com/0xed/0xed.html\">0xED</a>,
    and some nerve.\r\nStill no guarantees, though."
