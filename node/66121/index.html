		<div class="commentbody">I wish design schools would teach rudimentary business. So many come out asking this very question.

The first thing to figure out is what you'd need to charge to have a theoretical living wage if you were doing this full time.

($ desired annual salary + $ expenses) / # billable hours a year = hourly rate

Keep in mind you won't be billable 40 hours a week and don't underestimate your expenses.

After figuring that out, you can adjust as needed based on experience, skills, market etc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">We came up with a yardstick in the old Compuserve DTPForum nearly 20 years ago that provides a good starting point.

Take the amount of money that you would work for in a "real job". Not the entry rate, but the rate you would expect to get after a year or two to keep you from looking for something better. This is probably what your skills are worth (unless you have an inflated self worth). 

Triple that amount. 

That's it. You need to triple the base because you aren't getting benefits, paid holidays, or paid training/research time. You also will spend a lot of hours that are not billed. And you have expenses for your office, computer, and software.

This means that if you feel you are worth $20 working in an agency, then your rate should be $60 an hour. If you are worth $25, then your rate should be $75. And if you were thinking of only charging $30 an hour to freelance, you should realize that this is less than the minimum wage (in Ontario, at least).</div>
