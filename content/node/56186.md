  body: Yeah, you've got an 'A' and an 'f' there. It may be helpful to you to look
    at the inherent strokes of the letters you're abstracting. Generally if you keep
    the thicks in place you'll maintain legibility.

  body: Nico, your mark is pretty but not legible. Go back to sketching on paper before
    working on the computer. Also if you plan to continue designing your mark in a
    similar style to what you have posted you should re-think the type face you pair
    with it. Good luck.
