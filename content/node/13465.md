  leaf) as shown on the site below.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.whyboq.com/Identity_Building-Vancouver.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  am pretty sure that Whyboq did not design this logo and are passing it off as their
  own.\r\n\r\nAdditionally they have appropriated the \"Sauce\" identity (scroll down
  on their site). It was stolen directly from my site\r\n(http://www.miaandjem.com/work.php?subcatid=2)
  \ and the company name changed from Marmalade to Sauce. Unbelivable how desperate
  some people can be, pathetic!\r\n\r\nI would love to let the REAL designer of GO
  know.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    Ragnar, really nice work on your site too.\r\nI definitely intend to ask them
    to remove our work from their site. I guess this is one of the down sides to an
    on-line portfolio.\r\n\r\nI wonder how much of the work shown is actually theirs,
    there are too many different visual styles for my liking.\r\n\r\n(and yes we did

  body: ">and the instructors would just let it slide, knowing full well what was
    up. Is that commonplace?\r\n\r\nI've had some of my students cheat in this manner,
    but no so blatantly. Plagiarism is not always immediately apparent. If I didn't
    notice it at first, I'm hesitant to bring it up, because I feel stupid for not
    having called them on it immediately. I wouldn't want to make them redo an entire
    project because I had failed to point out a mistake earlier, that would be my
    fault, wouldn't it? Because I had failed to draw the distinction between homage
    and plagiarism. So, if I notice plagiarism, I check with other staff, and give
    the student the benefit of the doubt that they didn't know what they did was wrong,
    explain why it was, don't make them redo the project, and apologize for having
    to give them a lower mark for the work.\r\n\r\nUsually, plagiarization is not
    so blatant as the 3 grey blobs. \r\nBut just suppose it was a slightly different
    color, slightly different arrangement of 3 blobs...\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nBut hey,
    this is a typography forum.\r\nPlagiarism is no big deal in type design -- large
    software companies have appropriated others' type designs with impunity. Looks
    like it's infectious.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFile sharing:\r\n\r\nWith the present
    consensus on the acceptability of file \"sharing\", this kind of plagiaristic
    design behavior may well now only be considered wrong for not giving accreditation:
    recycling a design, even copying files, is the way of the future. You know what
    they say -- embrace the technology, the law is out of date..."
