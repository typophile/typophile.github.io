		<div class="commentbody">There are indeed pros to long descenders, and in some cases it makes great sense. But the &quot;limited vertical space&quot; con you mention is sort of an extreme manifestation of a much broader functional requirement leading to the need to make descenders notably shorter than ascenders in any &quot;real&quot; text face: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since economy is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a factor (to some extent), and you need the apparent leading to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->just right<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to ease &quot;linefeeds&quot; but without waste, optimal usage of the vertical space has a direct bearing on functional merit; it's not really that you want to avoid lines touching (which can only happen with very narrow measure), it's simply that the space you give to the descender zone might be better used elsewhere. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As you say though it's a matter of balance, as always.

		<div class="commentbody">Jon,  I tried to imagine what the typeface would look like in the context of a map or library label. All-caps settings tend to be used often (for headings, tables, etc.) and I think the uneven width of your capital letters would look somewhat awkward. Shrinking the W and M would help; make the narrow glyphs (B, P, R, U, V) a little wider so they'll sit nicer next to the wide round letters; but don't compress the round glyphs or you'll kill the geometric quality. The R needs work &ndash; it looks like a B with the bottom chopped off, and a straight leg would suit your intent better. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The number 1 should have a wider &quot;beak,&quot; (and maybe a &quot;foot&quot;) for the same reasons. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like Avenir but it's been getting overused, so I'm interested to see where you take this. I think there is a niche for a font that has the &quot;flavor&quot; of Avenir but is tailored for a certain function.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well I finally carved out some time to return to this.</p>
<p>I have redrawn many of the letters, incorporating many of the suggestions here (an improvement for sure). Here&rsquo;s the deal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Narrowed the &lsquo;W&rsquo; and &lsquo;M&rsquo;</li>
<li>redrew the &rsquo;s' which is more geometric now, but I&rsquo;m afraid is too narrow</li>
<li>Just noticed that the uc &lsquo;S&rsquo; needs to be redrawn too, especially its tail.</li>
<li>terminated the hook in the &lsquo;J&rsquo; and &lsquo;j&rsquo; earlier and they look nicer now.</li>
<li>K as noted in an earlier post</li>
<li>uc &lsquo;i&rsquo; has bars on it but I got scared and they look knobby. Same with &lsquo;J&rsquo;.</li>
<li>lc &lsquo;a&rsquo; is now a single storey (sigh) which works better.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Q&rsquo; has a new tail.</li>
<li>lc &lsquo;L&rsquo; stroke too thick and &lsquo;X&rsquo; strokes too thin.</li>
<li>also redrew the lc &lsquo;y&rsquo; and shortened its extender.</li>
</ul>
<p>I took the drawings into TypeTool and generated this font. The sample was made with the newly generated font in Illustrator and converted to outlines for the PDF so I didn&rsquo;t run into any weirdness. I did some ignorant kerning and spacing but I have never used a font editor before so this is obviously crude. No punctuation or numerals have been revised since the earlier drawings and are not in the font at this time.</p>
<p>Are W and M narrow enough now? Should I straighten the leg of the R? Please comment on anything as you see fit.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, now it&rsquo;s redundant. The original two-storey &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &rsquo;s' gave this face an identity and a reason to exist, and I don&rsquo;t think there was anything wrong with them.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;R&rsquo; looks awkward, but I don&rsquo;t think the leg must be straightened necessarily. I think it just needs to join a little further to the left.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;V&rsquo; should match; you can see the problem in &lsquo;ARRIVALS.&rsquo; A compromise between the two angles you have now would probably be best for this face.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Kevin,</p>
<p>I see the angle problem in ARRIVALS, that&rsquo;s a fair point. I&rsquo;ll try adjusting these.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, now it’s redundant. The original two-storey ‘a’ and ‘s’ gave this face an identity and a reason to exist<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Am I right in understanding that you think I have moved too close to other geo-sans by changing this ? I suspect I am wrestling with the originality/usefulness problem. Iaadmit that the single storey a is much more pedestrian but may be more useful in the intended application of labelling etc.. I think the s is improved though.</p>
<p>I am going to see if there&rsquo;s something I can do with the R. I like the curved leg and will keep it. I&rsquo;ll try your suggestion about moving the join.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and comments!</p>
<p>Jon</p>

		<div class="commentbody">You are correct, and I actually think it&rsquo;s more of a utility thing! When I saw your initial post, I thought to myself, &ldquo;Excellent, someone has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fixed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->legibility problem<!-- raw HTML omitted --> common to many geometric sans.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Especially<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for labelling. Whether at small screen sizes, small print with ink gain, lacking one&rsquo;s reading glasses, or just from glancing at it too fast, there is a huge potential for &lsquo;a&rsquo;/&lsquo;o&rsquo; confusion. If the tiny words in your gif were out of context, on a map, for instance, I honestly wouldn&rsquo;t know if I were looking at &lsquo;Rambas Tocos&rsquo; or what.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey Kevin,</p>
<p>Thanks for this. I went to the single story a after a lot of back and forthing and not feeling right about it either way.</p>
<p>I am going to do some studies on the a and see if I can find something that is better. I&rsquo;ll share when I get some good comparisons.</p>
