  body: "Good question.  Chicago's only comment about setting anything religious is
    \"The editors of the University of Chicago Press urge a spare, <em>down</em> style
    in this field as in others: capitalize what are clearly proper nouns and adjectives,
    and lowercase everything else except to avoid ambiguity.\" (Section 7.77)\r\n\r\nIn
    a discussion of religious writings in particular (7.87), their dictum is \"Capitalize
    names--and use roman type--for the Judeo-Christian Bible and its versions and
    editions:...\"  Also further on in that section is the same reco for books or
    other sacred works (such as the Dead Sea Scrols or the Talmud).\r\n\r\n"
