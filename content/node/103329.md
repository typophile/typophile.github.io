body: "As discussions in [[An Ideal Page: Line length, Leading, Margins, Page Size,
  Etc.]] and [[Cyrillic (Russian) ideal number of characters per line]] go, the topics
  discussed make absolutely no sense to me.  Discussing the \u201Coptimal number of
  characters on line\u201D begs the question\u200A\u2014\u200Ait presumes that when
  one increases font size by a certain percentage, the optimal line length should
  increase by <em>the same</em> percentage.  And I find this presumption silly.\r\n\r\nBut
  thinking about this more, the may be some <em>other</em> power law governing the
  relation between the font size and line length.  Suppose one is <em>required</em>
  to prepare two copies of a book, one set in 10pt, another in 14pt; suppose that
  the choice of page size and layout is completely in your hands.  It is natural to
  assume that the larger-font variant will be designed to have somewhat larger page
  size.  Probably not by 40%, but definitely larger.\r\n\r\nMy question is: how much
  larger?  The increase in percents will determine the exponent of the power law:
  if the \u201Cdesired\u201D increase in size is 18%, it is \xBD-power; if 12%, \u2153-power
  etc.  (Was this question discussed before?  I can\u2019t find any reference\u2026.)\r\n\r\nI
  see one major complication: choosing a page size should depend on the expected position
  of the book when read.  People reading in chaise-long-position would react on a
  heavier book differently than people who prefer reading at a desk.  Is there any
  wisdom in addressing such differences?\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nBTW,
  why I consider the rules like \u201C1\xBD lowercase alphabet\u201D ridiculous: a
  couple of thought experiments.  In XVIII century reform of Russian alphabet, 6 of
  46 \u201Cduplicate\u201D letters were removed.  Does it mean that the optimal length
  of line should have been decreased 15%?  In XX century reform of Russian alphabet,
  3 of 36 excess letters were removed.  Does it mean that the optimal length of line
  should have been decreased 10%?\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, note that difference
  between these two reforms: the XX century reform removed the terminal hard sign
  \u042A.  This reduced the average length of a word (about 10%?).  And <em>this</em>
  may have a chance of affecting the optimal line length (but here I consider line
  length in the case of a prescribed-in-advance font size!).\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nTo
  summarize: I think that discussion of optimal line length makes sense when one knows
  in advance the font size, and the expected reading pose.  It does not make sense
  without this knowledge."

    length (for normal reading within arm''s length, about 7") to avoid excessive
    head turning when eye movement is not enough to encompass the line. Reading should

    in characters tend to be longer.\r\n\r\nWhen discussing the \"ideal\" line length,
    though, generally the discussion is about a book that is optimal in other ways,
    such as having the ideal type size (possibly around 14 points) and it's an aesthetic
    characteristic.\r\n\r\nWhen a range of widths - 1 1/2 alphabets to 3 1/2 alphabets,
    for example - is specified, while part of that is due to an \"ideal\" not being
    well defined, that also includes space for the one to use varying with the type
    size."
