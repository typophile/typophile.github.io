body: 'Can somebody tell me what font this flyer uses? I like its vertical height
  and clarity, and am going through all of my fonts and can''t find a match. I feel
  as if it would be a very common font but I just don''t know what it is. I was using
  Impact, but think the font on this flyer is so much better. '
