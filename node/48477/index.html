  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Of the four newspapers that won this year's Society for News Design award, I've only managed to find a copy of one (The Guardian) and I'm hoping for help from the kind font freaks of the world. The three in question are:

Akzia (Moscow)
Expresso (Paco de Arcos, Portugal)
Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung

The last one isn't very exotic (unless "Sonntagszeitung" means something strange - perhaps just "Sunday edition"?) but Newseum.org hasn't shown front pages from any of them since I started looking (and they're also very lousy at returning emails and phone calls).

Of course I would be more than happy to barter something of -supposed- value with anybody willing/able to mail me an issue of one of those three.

I wouldn't be able to do that for at least a week, though, but let me know if nothing else materializes.

EDIT: And, yes, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung is the Sunday edition AFAIK, looking significantly different (less conservative) from the other days.</div>

The Expresso site that Miguel points out seems to give a great idea of the paper, although I couldn't figure out how to register* to get a PDF. Miguel, I would gladly Paypal you the mailing cost if you'd be willing to make that generous effort; January would be better than never, but too late for a project I'm working on. Reed, if Miguel does have to wait until January then I would certainly highly appreciate the following two scans: medium-res of a typical inside page, and max-res of a few lines of typical text. And if you can swing an actual back issue, that would rule.

* My Castillian doesn't unlock Portuguese, contrary to what I assumed when I was learning Castillian...

Uli, thanks much for that. BTW, are they no longer using Gulliver? (Or am I mixing up Frankfurter Allgemeine with another German paper?) Also, if anybody would be willing to snailmail me a copy of the Sunday Edition that would be very nice (and deserving of reciprocation).

So, what about the elusive Akzia...

That would be super! Please use the ground address in the link above. And let me know your understanding of "supposed value". :-)  Sadly I can't send you any of our phenomenal weather, but let me know what else might tickle your fancy.

I think that you are confusing the FAZ's Sunday Edition with the <em>Stuttgarter Zeiting</em>. The <em>Stuttgarter Zeitung</em> uses Guilliver.* The <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine</em> uses Times Ten, AFAIK.

* During a lecture earlier in the year at Reading, Gerard showed us <em>USA Today</em> and the <em>Stuttgarter Zeiting</em>. Both use Gulliver, but you won't think it just by glancing at the two papers together, because they both use the typeface in such completely different ways.</div>

I'm not sure if you've found the PDF versions of Akzia online yet. If not, here you go: http://www.akzia.ru/pdf. Granted it's not the same as a hard copy, but I hope it will work for now.

BTW, looking at that index page, does anybody know what the difference is between the issues that have the large circle-A logo versus the ones that say "akzia.****" in single guillemets? I assume the latter are special issues, like about "careers" and "mobiles"?
