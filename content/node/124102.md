  Lancet Wounded by Sang Mun, Feasby Semibold by Raf Rennie or Permeke Semi Bold by
  Josse Pyl. I'm looking for some similar fonts with this specific type of style,
  which are available for purchase.\r\n\r\nAnyone has some good tips? \r\n\r\nThank
  you"

  body: Out of curiosity, can you tell me what it is about this style that draws you?
    Is it the angularity and wedge serifs, or is it the intentional wrongness, the
    unpredictable weirdness? What sort of work you're doing? I'm sincerely fascinated
    about why these wonky serifs are <a href="http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/32461/fortesque">in</a>

    polished daily lives.\r\n\u2013 Making fonts is hipper than ever, but making a
    whole one from scratch is hard as always. So you take an existing font, \"customize\"
    it with some slipshod artsy modifications, and try to get famous.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
