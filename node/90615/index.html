The name of the company is Good Winter. No matter what I do I can't seem to get the full word winter out and keep it uniform. So I might just keep it like this, It's only for the web and anyone going to my sight knows the name of my company. I really have no idea how I feel about this logo. Feedback, advice, critique, all are welcome. Thanks

		<div class="commentbody">I think what you are missing is a vision of what you want the logo to do for you.  Why have a logo anyway?  What will it add to what you are already doing (and what is that anyway, I can't even guess with what you've posted)?  Once you have a clear idea of what the logo will accomplish, then you can define how it will accomplish that and start making choices about how to design it.  This is actually one of the more important parts of a designers job, to create a brief, a document that outlines what the goals of the project are, what needs it will fulfill and what messages it is communicating.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good call. That's probably why I have no feelings towards it at all. I sell mens clothing. I work with designers from the local universities, so a bit high fashion, but please don't let that imply pompous, haha anything but. The reason I would like a logo is to strengthen the brand image, and honestly just for the top of the website when it launches. It'll be a stand in until I can afford to higher a designer. I'm not completely foreign to design, but never done graphic design. I'm fluent in fashion design and photography. Anyway all and any feed back is much appreciated.

		<div class="commentbody">I think you need to simplify your intentions for this logo. Don't think of it as something that will instantly give your business an image and a voice. You do that yourself with the way your brand talks and how you display and choose the clothes you sell. Especially since you aren't well versed in graphic design, I'd say you'll be better off creating a simple logotype that clearly communicates your brand name and hints at the style you're aiming for—even something as simple as typing out the whole name "good winter" in the same typeface that you have "good" set in up there. 

The best thing you can do for yourself is maintain consistency in everything you create. Keep things simple and in line with your vision. Once you can afford to hire a designer, you can work with them to create more of a complex voice and image for your brand—one that will probably have developed since your company has had time to grow and find its niche.

Brand strategy aside, the mark you have isn't a bad start. The weight of the 'W' is too thick compared to 'GOOD' (or vice versa). I'm not sure, though, that abbreviating only the 'W' makes much sense. I would probably either use both the 'G' and 'W' to form some kind of monogram mark, with 'Good Winter' spelled out as a separate logotype, or simply only use the logotype.

Hope that helps, and interested to see how things turn out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you Penn. Excellent advice, very good points. I know the companies image is strong. That's what I'm going to do, I'll chose a type face that I feel is consistent with my brand and put it at the top of the site.

I've discovered threw years of practice the most detrimental thing I can do is let myself get bogged down by irrelevant details, especially when it comes to my business. My business has excellent customer service, and the image around the company is actually fairly established simply because I learned early on if I'm going to run a respectable business I need to keep my OCD tendencies in check, the only time my obsession serves me well is during clothing design time. 

Now as I'm taking my company online I'm forgetting my golden rule. Maybe it's cause I've recently found a LOVE for type and web design. Anyway thanks again for reminding me of good methods. If you'd like to check on the progression of my page, logo, etc, your more then welcome to at www.goodwinterclothing.com. Right now the sites under construction, my projected launch date is beginning to mid april. 

K, now that I got my little rant out of the way I have another question. How much does it cost to higher a graphic designer to design a company logo? I know, I know, this question is ridiculously vayge (no idea how to spell that word, auto correct isn't even trying, VAY-GUH), but any sort of ball park for a professional with credentials would be appreciated. </div>

It can vary tremendously, anywhere from a few hundred (probably a student) to several thousand (an experienced pro) to tens of thousands (a large design studio). The bad economy has impacted the businesses of many designers, though, and that might work in your favor.

Keep in mind that the services you receive can vary tremendously. Someone with a low price may spend an hour coming up with a few top-of-the-head ideas, and then email you final art as a JPEG, and that's it.  

A more expensive designer may meet personally with you (if they are local) several times, spend lots of time coming up with concepts and refining them based on your feedback, design your letterhead and business card and get printing estimates and review the printer's proofs, maybe help design your website, and in general do a much more thorough and professional job.

If you're on a tight budget, hrant's idea of barter or a student might be a good idea.  </div>

That would cost around $50, wouldn't it? From what I've seen few hundred dollars typically buys few concepts, several iterations over a selected concept and a vector deliverable. What you described would be an output of an Indian "24 hour logo service" outlet that's hardly even worth classifying as a graphics design.</div>

I would say find a way to make it work with the two words. It can be done for sure.
