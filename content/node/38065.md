body: "Hi everyone\r\n\r\nI've been given an assignment for my typography module to
  find a font from the 1970's. Its quite hard to find a site which lists fonts in
  chronological order of design so i was wondering if anyone on here could recommend
  some great fonts from that decade. Something iconic and perhaps away from the groovy
  psychadelic style fonts that immediately spring to mind.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\nJono"

  body: To me, the 1970s are represented by Avant Garde. ITC was on the way, Carnarse,
    Lubalin, Benguiat were in top form, Photolettering was great. Avant Garde was
    new, had lots of alternatives so it didn't have to look like the same face being
    set over and over again -- and it has held up.

    they are so distinctive without being anything like the stereotypical 70's fonts
    you see around.\r\nThanks guys!"

    \"S\" is for the pluralization of seventies -- it is not for the possessive...\r\n\r\nThe
    hyphen is a space holder for the 19...\r\n\r\nThanks."

    not a hyphen. Boy are we type geeks or what?

  body: "I agree Patty - though Ehague, sometimes as a typographer, I found myself
    talking in grunts and one syllable words. No one around, there was no need to
    communicate - just make that type look good, and the equipment \"sing.\"\r\n\r\nIt
    has been a rough week and I'm glad I have any memory at all... which is more than
    I can say for my mac.\r\nThe drive crashed yesterday -- I took it to an Island
    Guru (funny, because so many Mac folks here count on me) he couldn't help, so
    he put me in touch with his IBM Guru - who couldn't get the drive to show a \"signature\"
    and therefore, it was a goner...\r\n\r\nI went to dinner, had a drink - came home,
    talked it over with my computer. I then realized, I'd been trying to reinstall
    the system folder from the original G5 disks - no no - I got out X-TIGER and went
    to work By 8:18pm (a whole 14 hours later) my computer is back up and running
    the best I've seen it run in ages.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the new drive has arrived
    - but I need to finish my workload before I'd consider swopping it out...\r\n\r\nSorry
    for the hyphen instead of apostrophe - it really is tiredness, frustration, etc.
    etc.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, congrats on being the most prolific poster on typophile
    today - with 88 -- wahoooo."
