    referenced, maybe you can help me. If you had felt inspired to make a useful response
    to my first posting, you could have clarified the difference of type designer
    and typographer for me (granted, you did link me). Then, it would have been very
    simple for you to talk about both a typographer, and a type designer, all the
    while sharing some names and information. I could then use that information for
    some kind of direction other than arguing with strangers.\r\n\r\nI'm bothered
    by the fact that you're saying they're so different. Do you know for a fact that
    no type designers have been typographers? If so, please show me proof.\r\n\r\nI'm
    posting here to learn, not to impress people with attitude. "

  body: "Martin,\r\n\r\nyour question regarding influential contemporary typographers
    intrigues me. It is completely understandable that many people, laymen and even
    design professionals see little distinction between <em>typographers</em> and
    <em>type designers</em> nowadays.\r\n\r\nUp until and through the formative years
    of \"Desktop Publishing\" being a <em>typographer</em> was more than just a loose
    term... it was an actual profession, a real job with specific responsibilities
    related to the selection, specification, proofing, editing, refinement of typographic
    matter and took place from the initial design phase of printed material through
    the final proofing of printing. \r\n\r\nPrior to the demise of typesetting suppliers
    (shops that would set type as a business), typographers would work in such professions
    helping to prepare, proof and QC (quality control) typesetting before it was delivered
    to the client. Many typographers and type directors would also work at design
    studios and ad agencies, book publishers, magazine and newspaper publishers, and
    for printers that owned their own typesetting equipment. \r\n\r\nIn many cases,
    typographers and type directors would critically examine and adjust ink flow and
    plate/blanket pressure during press proofing before signing-off on print runs.\r\n\r\nSo
    in essence, a typographer was responsible for the production and aesthetic control
    on the <em>USE</em> of type and quality of printed reproduction. \r\n\r\nThat
    was one of several chief responsibilities while I worked for Agfa's Type Division
    during the eighties (I also headed the Type Design department for several years
    but had never actually designed my own typeface). I had to oversee all phases
    of preparation and reproduction of all printed material coming out of the division,
    and since we were a major developer of typefaces as well as a major distributor
    of licensed type designs, that meant that if it didn't reflect high quality, no
    one would buy the fonts.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, being a typographer has little
    association with the actual <em>designing</em> of typefaces, though many typographers
    are type designers and vice versa. Oddly enough, a good typographer could make
    a lousy type designer as with the other way around. Think of it as a good composer
    would can play an instrument but only fairly compared to a great musician would
    can't write music for beans.\r\n\r\nNow, back to your question -- what is your
    chief interest?\r\n> In those who impact and influence the look of type or those
    who influence the way we use it? Maybe a little of both?"

    That's hard to answer. I thought i'd pose this question and see what responses
    I get. I'd like to consider this discussion to be a process. But I guess what
    I'm looking for are type designers who have influenced design through the aesthetics
    of the type.\r\n\r\nI.E. Futura or Akzidenz-Grotesk...They have certainly influenced
    the American visual language. A great example is The Royal Tennenbaums...The average
    viewer may not know (why) they respond to Futura being typeset with a 50's aesthetic,
    but they DO sense enough to find it humorous.\r\n\r\nBut maybe what i'm looking
    for is something obvious and at play around us currently. Maybe because of ease
    of use or cost or WHATEVER.\r\n\r\nDo you guys think the use of fonts that look
    digital are bogus, or do they have an appropriate place?\r\n\r\nWhat is the typographic
    visual language evolving into now? Will we see more digital age vernacular or
    a rebellion against it?\r\n\r\nI've never designed type, but I'm a graphic designer
    so type is absolutely important to me. I tend to value type for its form and beauty
    over the technical aspects...."

  body: "> <em>What is the typographic visual language evolving into now? Will we
    see more digital age vernacular or a rebellion against it?</em>\r\n\r\nHmmmm...
    valid questions, but in a way do our answers or responses matter? \r\n\r\nSince
    we are now virtually connected with anyone and everyone globally at this time,
    and since anyone who can access the web can potentially \"publish\" literature
    or post images, and because trained graphic designers and typographers represents
    a small fraction of 1% of that population, IMHO the key influences and influencers
    of visual language may be \"home-grown\" grassroots non-professional uses of type.\r\n\r\nDuring
    the age of Pre-Desktop Publishing, printed visual matter, motion/film/animation/video,
    signage, architectural graphics and wayfinding systems were generally designed,
    produced and distributed/displayed by \"professionals\". Access to the equipment
    and cost of development kept most laypeople away from venturing into graphic design
    and publishing. In other words, the world of visual material was designed and
    produced by a small population.\r\n\r\nI am both deeply interested and concerned
    about our visual future, yet at the same time I find the time exciting and ripe
    for change be it for better or worse, evolving or regressing, but more than likely
    a time of new directions and expressions.\r\n\r\nThe affects of globally connectivity
    can often (and already has) lead to producing highly regional communities and
    micro-cultures.\r\n\r\nTake beer for instance (Mmmmm!). Though we are living with
    major beverage conglomerates who can produce and ship almost anywhere on earth,
    the rise of microbreweries and the diversity and quality of beverage is heartening.
    I think it is part of our human needs to NOT have everything immediately accessible
    and to enjoy what it takes some effort to get to, experience or attain.\r\n\r\nIn
    short, what I am sensing is that some incredibly exciting or innovative ventures
    using typography or designing letterform/glyph systems will happen (or are already)
    in the smallest of communities (geographic or culturally). The rest of the world
    will keep seeing re-hashed re-fried visuals. <em>Would you like to add a side
    of serifs to your order? Or Super-size your regular?</em> :-)"

  body: "Where a type designer is also art director, or works closely with an art
    director, it's difficult to say which is the chicken or the egg -- the type design
    or the art direction.\r\n\r\nThat would rule out Brody and Lubalin (type designers/art
    directors whose types advanced their notions of what typography could be) and
    also Berlow and Black, or Licko and Vanderlans (type designer + art director,
    where the art director immediately presented a certain way of using the new types).
    But the Emigre fonts could still be seen as influencing Carson.\r\n\r\nFrutiger's
    \"Univers\" face, because of its systematized family, might the bill, in that
    it enabled a complex, single-face kind of typography to emerge in the 1960s (ironically,
    whether or not Univers was the face used). But perhaps this was a direction already
    presaged by the proliferation of Helvetica styles, and its use by the Swiss school.\r\n\r\nUnivers,
    as pictured in the famous style chart, defined an aspect of design theory, similar
    in function to an axiom or an equation. Similarly, Dead History defines post-structuralism,
    and Beowolf defines random computer generative art. It seems that type designs
    can be intellectual touchstones for the way one thinks about design, independent
    of their actual usage."

    impression that things havent changed alot in type design for a long time....\"\r\n\r\nConfusion
    between typographer (one who composes type), typography (which is type when composed,
    e.g.), and type designer (who designs type), is common. Nearly all type designers
    are typographers, by requirement, at least in the testing of fonts, which require
    composition to be worth calling a font. Many type designers are also typographers,
    composing things with other people's fonts too. Typographers have become type
    designers, but most do not. \r\n\r\nThe technology of type design has changed
    several times in the last 75 years, and quite dramatically in the last 15. The
    art, has changed profoundly as type design tools and font formats associated with
    these technologies have opened a way to whomever has the will. The whole history
    of the craft that survives in physical form, is becoming available in digital
    form, and the waves of new designers, are creating new forms every day.\r\n\r\nThe
    only \"things haven't changed a lot\" in my opinion, are the letters, but even
    there, more need to made now than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    when it comes to news in typedesign its in part true that its is not really much
    going on in my eyes. I`d like to see more of the work in the type catalogues like
    Raph, Hrant and other people here seem to do at that moment. The type catalogues
    by FontShop and so on for me are a bit depressing. It is all so liveless, rounded
    sharp at the edges, litte charming. Don\u2019t if I explain me right. It is true
    that we are missing brakethroughs, no? Mrs Eaves was quite good for example but
    only the italic to my eyes. For me many type designs lack charm, some kind of
    personal treatment. That will hold on for more than 5 months. New classics if
    you want. But I am expressing only some kind of personal impression, un non so
