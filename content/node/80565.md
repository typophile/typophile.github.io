  advice, especially on the /t/ glyph.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://updo.nl/file/28b4e6fa.png\"
  />\r\n\r\nOf this three versions, I think the first one looks too tiny compared
  to the other glyphs. But what about the others? Should I raise/lengthen the arm?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  this is the full glyph set (as of now):\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://updo.nl/file/f9c8c40e.png\"

  body: The slanted crossbar looks wrong no matter how you position it; if you must
    use the angled approach on the t, why not apply it to the bottom of the letter?

    src=\"http://updo.nl/file/f2042b60.png\" />\r\n\r\nOr the other way around? But
    you're probably right, the slanted crossbar (isn't it a rotated crossbar, technically?)
    doesn't look right. Maybe I'll just stick with a simple straight one. How does
    it look on the /e/ and /a/?"

  body: In any case, usually the right part of t's crossbar reaches the x height.

  body: "Ahah of course. For now I think it looks a bit out of place between the other
    glyphs.\r\n\r\n<img src=http://updo.nl/file/a45b2894.png />\r\n\r\nIt works better
    with the f I have in mind, too. But thanks for your help guys, I still have to
    learn a lot about t's."

    third one, and use the first one as a capital."

  body: "<img src=http://updo.nl/file/67dc5682.png />\r\n\r\nThat's what I've got
    now. I would like to hear your opinion. Is it a bad idea to use a different approach
    for v and w?\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm trying to apply (flat) kerning in fontlab, but it
    doesn't show up in the quick preview or the generated .ttf file. What am I doing
    wrong?"
