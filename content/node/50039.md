  look. Can anyone suggest suitable fonts for such a project? Also does anyone know
  the name of the font used in the attached Santa Ambroeus logo?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\nMukhtar[img:sites/default/files/old-images/santa_ambroeus_4592.jpg]"

    fonts Miss Tiffany's mentioned will work. Also its good to know the background
    behind the Santa Ambroeus logo Kco.\r\n\r\nThe name of the Candy Store is 'Halal
    Candy Store' - so in addition to the traditional look it would be good to have
    a connection to Islam.\r\n\r\nMukhtar"

    I hope you've got so many clues of advancing the quality of the logo. Good luck.\r\n<a
