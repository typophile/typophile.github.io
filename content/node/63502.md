  campaign. I couldn't find the original ad online, so I grabbed a screenshot from
  another website that uses the same typeface in a larger context (and reversed it
  so it's easier to read). Thanks in advance for the help. \r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen-shot-2009-10-26-at-9_5768.54.17-AM.jpg]"

    recently looked this up because Serif Gothic is used on some editions of the Golden
    Guides book series."
