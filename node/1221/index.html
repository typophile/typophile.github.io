  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi All. <BR>I&#39;ve been working on and off with a collection of typefaces for my conceptual foundry Brainreactor/GyoDea. The collection starts to take shape, and I would be glad of any comments regarding my work.  <BR> <BR>The collection contains both display/experimental and some sans serifs for Display/Logo purposes. <BR> <BR>I appologize for the pdf layout in this preview, I work on a book where all the fonts will be displayed in a proper way. <BR> <BR>All typefaces have full alphabets with upper- and lowercase letters, numbers and so on. However,  I think it&#39;s a bit early to show them all in here. I have 24 other full alphabets going on on top of the ones I show here. I will upload a new pdf within two weeks, with more and harder experimental Typefaces. <BR> <BR>Any comments? <BR> <BR>Andreas Lindholm<center> <table border=1><tr><td> <table> <tr> <td align=center valign=top> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" alt=""><br> 999.2 K </td> <td align=left valign=top> Fonts_Preview_01.pdf<br> <b>&quot;Preview Brainreactor/GyoDea&quot;</b> </td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> </center> </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Andreas, I like the types, allthough they very much remind me of B&uuml;ro Destruct.  <BR>I see the point Stephen has with the readability and clarity, but that doesn&#39;t bother me that much. These types will probably only be used in flyers, poster, CD covers, etc. Therefor they are OK, if you ask me. They are more peaces of artwork than types.  <BR>Where BD made more readible type, in the shape of futuristic forms, you go more autonome. It&#39;s your personal decision and that&#39;s fine. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t stop bringing them out. You will find people that want to buy them. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, it seams like you guys want some more to discuss. <BR>I will upload some more when this discussion starts to discontinue... <BR> <BR>&#62;Jim, sending 30 dollars with mail worked a couple of years ago, the thing is that the fonts where released with a book called &#34;Metalheart&#34;. Some people wanted the fonts only and asked me how to get them without buying the book. Back in 2000, I was making the site in that purpose. I still get some dollars from it. The site is almost 4 years old, and some of the fonts are 8 years old. Still going strong in some computers... Thanks for your comments! <BR> <BR>&#62;Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Andreas, I&#39;m a huge admirer of your work. Let me say right now that I&#39;m no type guru. But I am a lover of words. In fact, my love of type comes directly from my love for words and the act of expression through writing. <BR> <BR>For this simple reason, I have no problems at all with the readability of individual characters, or even the readability of a word, so long as its aesthetic expression is dramatic and intelligent. It may take a moment of adjustment to pick up the letterforms, but it is the artfullness of the type that demands I invest my attention in the word it represents. <BR> <BR>What I mean to say is, there are more uses for type than just stringing together complete sentences or paragraphs. I do not see any need to compare your work to more mainstream samples or useage. <BR> <BR>There is a definate place for your type: right on the cutting edge. <BR> <BR>Wherever there are words written in the throws of anxiety, anger, excitement, suprise, nearly any condition of extremety, your letterforms shine appropriate.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I agree with you completely. <BR> <BR>My point was that much of Andreas&#39; work is so obviously aimed at titling and not paragraph useage, there is no need to justify why we like his work with comments like &#34;these types will probably only be used in flyers, poster, CD covers, etc. Therefor they are OK&#34;. <BR> <BR>I do not want to lock horns with you on the deeper effects of typography upon the reader, as you have given this subject much more thought than I. <BR> <BR>However, I for one, am up for the challenge of a few new takes on familiar letterforms for the sake of emotional representation of the word itself.</div>
