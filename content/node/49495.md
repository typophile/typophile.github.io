  body: "You're on fire, Stephen. Thank you.\r\n\r\nI love Ministry, because I love
    British street furniture.\r\n\r\nI love anything by Jock Kinneir and Margaret
    Calvert too. I am thinking of doing a website devoted to Rail Alphabet (and possibly
    the British Rail corporate identity). It's a bit self indulgent but I don't care.
    It's a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
