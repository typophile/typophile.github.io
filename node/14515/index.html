  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Recently, Andi Emery started a topic asking if teaching <a href="http://typophile.com/node/14469">traditional copyfitting</a> methods to graphic designers had value anymore. This is a question of particual interest to educators who want to improve typographic awareness in students.</p>
<p>Given the fact that typography is a minor sub-set in most general graphic design programs, it sparked an interest in exploring types of exercises that might stimulate creative and cognitive abilities useful to budding typographers and type designers.</p>
<p>The topic of type education already exists under the heading of <a href="http://typophile.com/node/694"><strong>Typographic Edumacators</strong></a> within the <em>Special Interest Groups</em> area of Typophile. This topic area is sadly malnurished having only two replies to an important topic started by Nathan Matteson over two years ago! All of the real dialogs related to education are actually peppered throughout the entire Typophile forum.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nuf said.</p>
<p><strong>If Typography was a Video Game</strong>
This is a thought that came to my mind after participating in Andi&rsquo;s topic. No, I&rsquo;m not advocating a game blasting Comic Sans with laser guns, or a Sim game trying to pickup type hotties at a party. I&rsquo;m not even suggesting an &ldquo;educational&rdquo; game a la Sesame Street or Nick Jr. (though they&rsquo;re wonderfully useful).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking more in the line of simple, engaging and hopefully stimulating exercises that might trigger higher cognitive and creative activities in the mind of students. Obviously this doesn&rsquo;t need to take the form of a video game, but the only reason it came to mind is that all designers are now trained in front of a screen.</p>
<p>Here goes my first shot:</p>
<p><a href="http://enchantedmind.com/puzzles/tangram/tangram.html" target="new"><strong>Tangram</strong></a>
Is this ancient Chinese game (or variant) useful in developing a heightened sense of notan?
Can it help designers to create a plethora of recognizable shapes using only a fixed set of elements?</p>
<p>Description (From Answers.com)
Tangram (Hanyu Pinyin: Cantonese: ch&rsquo;i ch&rsquo;ae pan; literally Seven-Board of Cunning) is an ancient Chinese puzzle.
It consists of 7 pieces, called Tans, which fit together to form a square:
5 triangles of various sizes, 
1 square 
1 parallelogram 
The objective is to form a given shape with seven pieces. 
The shape has to contain all the pieces, which must not overlap.</p>
<hr>
<p>I can already see that exploring helpful tools and methods of developing typographic sensibilities will be a slow and laborous mission, as it has taken me a considerable amount of time just to get this post up. Hopefully a few of us can collectively hatch up some worthwhile exercises. I&rsquo;ve got a few more simple activities to share, but it takes time to really think them through.</p>
<p>Look for the &ldquo;Typography Edumacators&rdquo; topic area to come alive again.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Excellent suggestion, Norbert. The real strength of tangrams, I believe, is in its making people aware of <strong>possibilities</strong>. I have great admiration for the more skilled practitioners of the art, who seem able to coax an immense range of images out of what is really a rather limited tool set.</p>
<p>Another exercise which might prove helpful in developing typesense would be a game which has rules, but they are not spelled out at the beginning of the game: the purpose of the game is, in fact, to discover the rules. Ideally, these rules could be expressed graphically. Just a thought&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Norbert, the tangram exercise is an interesting starting point. What would be the exact objective/learning outcome, as it relates to typography? I mean, are we simply trying to get students to recognize forms and how they fit together or are we trying to have students recognize form and counterform? Is this more of a spatial exercise or can we tie it in more closely to type?</p>
<p>(Thanks for starting this up!!)</p>

<p>Nick,
keep the ideas flowing. Also explore those activities which are of particular value to graphic designers in training their &ldquo;typographic eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andi,
thanks for getting the ol' juices flowing. The tangram has no definitive educational outcome, and it may be only one of several obtional exercises for students. By suggesting the Tangram I am exploring simple ways of stimulating higher levels of pattern recognition and creating recognizable shapes with minimal visual clues.</p>
<p>What if I asked a student to construct each character of the alphabet using only a hairpin, 2&quot; piece of string and 2 M&amp;Ms. I&rsquo;m not joking&hellip;</p>
<p>David,
I had the same feelings exactly about &ldquo;Edumacators,&rdquo; but now I think it might be OK. We&rsquo;ll just have to see if we can keep interest growing or if we go down in flames like the previous attempt.</p>

<p>For a revivalist, discovering the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; is the key ingredient in creating a character set consistent with the artifacts at hand. For those who design their own typefaces &ldquo;from scratch,&rdquo; perhaps a game in which the player devised the rules (which might have unintended consequences down the line) might be more appropriate.</p>

<p>That was my reaction too. It is really both fun and educational, which is actually a rare thing. The &lsquo;shoot the straight quote&rsquo; stuff is fun but doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of educational content, I think.</p>
<p>One could do a similar thing by taking, say a Baskerville n and asking the student to make an m and u in the same style, then compare it to a few pro versions of Baskerville. Then give them the ho and ask to design the bd. This would have to be in Illustrator or Fontlab, though. If you did the same thing for four or five diverse classics, it would be incredibly educational, I think.</p>

I think if the students had a bit of background first (of course), maybe use Tracy&rsquo;s Letters of Credit as a primer, and then attempted to build the other letters - and compare them to existing characters, they would really benefit from the hands-on learning. Great idea.</div>

<p>The &ldquo;building a character&rdquo; exercise would be a much better approach than the old obligatory &ldquo;comping headlines&rdquo; that many primers have. My students (and I) found no value other than becoming familiar with the character forms.</p>
<p>Developing additional characters from existing ones is much more engaging, challenging and in the long run can add to the student&rsquo;s understanding of letterform structure.</p>
<p>Andi,
we (plus others interested memebers) should start compiling key suggestions. (More than likely offline). So far the ideas are sprinkled in several topics going on lately. I would be terrible to see a single good contribution get lost.</p>

Feel free to change the name of the Special Interest Group and I promise I won&rsquo;t be offended.</p>
<p>In any case, it&rsquo;s heartening that the whole dialogue among teacher-types is thriving on Typophile these days. More so that the days of yore anyway. I haven&rsquo;t been as active of a participant as I used to be &ndash; teaching&rsquo;s been taking up more and more of my time &ndash; but I hope to make some more time to participate in this sort of discussion.</p>
<p>Although, quite frankly, I&rsquo;m conflicted as to the idea of turning typography too much into a &lsquo;game&rsquo;. Students today seem completely different than when I was in college (a mere 10 years ago), but I buck at the thought of &lsquo;coddling&rsquo; them. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not coddling, it&rsquo;s just change, but so much of what I hear about typography classes (not on this board, mind you) sounds like either (1) teachers obsfucate things to make their practice seem overly esoteric/important, or (2) the classroom becomes a playpen that panders to students&rsquo; lack of attention.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the meantime I have to prepare for class :-P so ta-ta-for-now.</p>

<p><em> If typography &ldquo;were&rdquo; a video game.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>John, I kept repeating &ldquo;were&rdquo; in my mind and did not have a full understanding of why. Thanks.</p>
<p>matteson,
my take on exploring this area is slightly different than many of the design curriculums I am aware of. My personal intent is to find methods, tools, or exercises that MIGHT aid students of general graphic design programs to step through the portal of typographic awareness.</p>
<p>In other words, my own personal interest is to help &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; and heighten those mysterious powers of super type awareness which lay dormant in only a handful of students.</p>
<p>I have asked myself many times, why can some people look at a full page of straight text and see the continuity or irregularities of type color, the <em>dazzle</em> or <em>spikeyness</em>, the need for an addition point of line spacing, or understand why the column should be extended by 4 picas, and finally decide that one vendor&rsquo;s version of Cheltenham should be replaced by a slightly different version to feel right.</p>
<p>These are abilities I have seen in very few graphic designers. If playing Tangram or Tetris during lunch helps to build these awarenesses, then I&rsquo;m all for them.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t want to build &ldquo;games.&rdquo; I want to find out if there is any sort of activity, on screen or off, which can help raise that awareness. It seems a dumb analogy, but I keep remembering the scenes in <em>Karate Kid</em> where the student develops exceptional blocking abilities by waxing cars using only two specific movements of <em>Wax on</em> and <em>Wax off</em>.</p>
<p>I immensely respect the expertise and efforts of the many qualified and fully trained educators who build knowledge and train their students in design and typography.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to poo-poo on what you&rsquo;re doing at all Norbert. I actually think it&rsquo;s a great idea. I dig the idea of building tangrams because they might help students develop the visual/spatial acuity needed for typography, through a non-typographic method. Because I certainly know that college freshman &amp; sophomore can only look at type for <em>so long</em> before they&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m just wary of the term &lsquo;game&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s all. For instance, like William, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the &lsquo;shoot the fake quotes&rsquo; game. As much as I hate improper quotation marks ;-)</p>

<p>I think this is likely the case across the board. It&rsquo;s how I feel about my past students. But I think the challenge (which is partially what we&rsquo;re addressing I think?) is how to impart a knowledge or love or understanding of typography to the rest of the kids in the classroom who don&rsquo;t engage themselves in that long-term one-and-one work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s obvious innit. It&rsquo;s been a long day at school. I think I need to sleep.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing at all wrong with kids washing your car. One of mine just gave me a bottle of Ardbeg. Sweet!</p>
