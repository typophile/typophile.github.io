    type"> <BR> <BR>so this is some of the type &#34;set&#34;.  i&#39;m having trouble
    getting the kerning pairs i set in fontographer to work in illustrator or quark.
    they seem to reset themselves somewhat. does anyone know why this happens? any
    help would be most appreciated. <BR> <BR>the main idea as far as promotional material
    will go is as follows. the type is in a ficticious journal that was found and
    was written by mary shelley&#39;s frankenstein while he was exiled in the mountains.
    each promotional piece &#40;posters, mailings, web banners,etc.&#41; will contain
    some of the writings from the journal but will not disclose who the person writing
    it is until the  internet movie i create comes out and in it  we finally discover
    the true identity of the author. any thoughts on this concept?  <BR>thanks, <BR>austin

  body: I would scale down the t. A lot. It hits like a hammer every time it appears
    in the text, and destroys any illusion of real handwriting.

    hand writing.
