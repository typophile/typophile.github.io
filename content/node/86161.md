body: "My last post on \"Antechamber\" was a bit premature; I knew I wanted to create
  a somewhat neutral, condensed display face, but the first attempt was way too generic.\r\n\r\nThis
  new take on the face is much heavier and stronger, with tiny crossbars on the /I/
  (a la Bell Gothic) and stylized ink traps. As I said last time, this is a display
  face for use in the titles of an animation project that will deal with architecture,
  so I want to create a face that looks somewhat industrial, somewhat \"machined\",
  and very sturdy.\r\n\r\nThe heavily filled alternates from the last post are being
  left out for now. I want to get the basic alphabet as balanced as possible first.\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback on the quality of the curves, stroke thickness and character widths would
  be really appreciated. In particular, I stared at the /B/ way too much this morning
  and am suddenly a little uncomfortable with it. If anything jumps out about the
  /S/, /M/ or /W/ that'd be useful as well.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

  body: "First of all, letters with ink traps look like from one font, letters without
    - from second, and /I/ - from third different font.\r\nFont with ink traps would
    be interesting, while the one without is quite generic.\r\n\r\nMake all horizontals
    narrower for optical correction. Look at /T/ or /L/.\r\nGet rid of /I/ serifs.\r\nTry
    to apply ink traps whenever possible. For 90\xB0 connections, maybe cutting in
    at 45\xB0 angles would work.\r\n\r\nStyle unity in the typeface is the most important
    thing. What this one here doesn't have yet."

  body: "1) Total agreement on the ink traps. I've been thinking about adding them
    to the 90-degree connections and this convinces me.\r\n\r\n2) I was going for
    ultra-minimal optical contrast between horizontals and verticals (it is there,
    believe it or not), but I guess this is \"too\" minimal. I'll bump that up (it
    was bugging me on the S anyway, so this is an excuse to fix it)\r\n\r\n3) Unity
    was definitely a problem once I started writing sentences with it. The ink traps
    pretty much come out of nowhere, so it'll be nice to see it when it's more consistent.\r\n\r\nThis
    is exactly the kind of feedback I was hoping for and I should have another rev
    up before tonight. Thanks again!"

    As for the serifs on the I, I know that I'm fundamentally incorrect on this issue
    and always will be, but it's going to take a lot more shaming and criticism before
    I'll be convinced to remove it. I know it's wrong... but it just feels so right.\r\n4)
    Lastly, a few character widths have been modified as well."

    but ultimately it looked less event (since the negative space was only being applied
    to one axis) and made consistency across the entire set of glyphs more difficult.
    With a few intuitive exceptions, the traps always come in at the halfway point
    of the angle of the intersection, which gives them a logical direction I can easily
    apply to any case.\r\n\r\nHere are two new PDFs, one with a plain character set
    and another with a pangram. Still no metrics. And of course, this is a display
    face intended mostly for titling, but I consider a big block of body text (for
    which it's most certainly not intended) a good way to vet it.\r\n\r\nwww.alexvaranese.com/transfer/amv-antechamber_r4_glyphs.pdf\r\nwww.alexvaranese.com/transfer/amv-antechamber_r4_pangram.pdf"

    cool but somewhat confusing. Maybe I missed something in your suggestion.\r\n\r\nI
    also know what you mean about the stencil look; characters without any intersecting
    strokes definitely feel a little left out, but I feel that given the purpose of
    the typeface (a fairly standard condensed face with alternates for each glyph
    that will add a much heavier dose of stylization), I can accept the minor inconsistency
    for the sake of preventing the face as a whole from getting any more complicated."

    metrics and kerning. The spacing isn't going to win me any awards, but I think
    it's more or less on par with the typefaces that inspired it (Trade Gothic Bold,
    Univers Condensed Bold, etc.)\r\n\r\nI'd like to get some feedback on how it seems
    to perform before I move on to releasing it for general consumption, so I've uploaded
    a beta version here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.alexvaranese.com/transfer/amv-antechamber_beta_zero.ttf\r\n\r\nI've
    also added the lowercase set, which is actually a collection of alternate uppercase
    letters with heavy fills inside counters and between strokes. This particular
    feature ties directly into the video piece it's being created for, so it might
    make sense to ignore these entirely for the purpose of testing. The typeface is
    pretty conventional aside from the loweracse alts, and that's where I'm looking
    to vet it as thoroughly as possible. The alts are just a bonus for people like
    me that have specific use for them.\r\n\r\nAs a display face, I want it to be
    solid, reliable and usable, but it of course doesn't need all the nuanced perfection
    of a text face, especially since its intended application (titles in a video piece)
    tend to be hand-kerned a little anyway. But I'd like to make sure it doesn't strike
    anyone as a total mess.\r\n\r\nThe final version will be free, of course, so I'm
    not looking to \"protect\" anything here, but this beta has \"BETA ZERO\" written
    into the zero and letter O characters just to make sure anyone who helps me test
    this doesn't accidentally leave a potentially unfinished font installed.\r\n\r\nAny
    feedback would be great. Thanks!"
