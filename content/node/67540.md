body: "Sometime ago, I saw a typeface designed by Elias Bitencourt, named [[http://typophile.com/node/29444|Tex]].
  I then went over to fontstruct and started designing a typeface that worked in similar
  ways to Tex. In a sense, it's very similar, with some gliphs, like the 'a' being
  almost copies from Tex. But it was a typeface I very much liked, and I though about
  designing one with the same principles, and following a basic set of rules.\r\nThe
  result so far is [[http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/287858|Godric]].\r\nI'd
  like some input on this, from you guys, which I regard as being the best way to
  learn, from commentaries from people that work with type constantly.\r\nI'm also
  saving some kind of specimen on the attachment, but you can download the type from
  fontstruct. It has some kerning issues, and I intend to work that out after finishing
  the rest of the glyphs, on an open version of this."

  body: Nice. k, j, s , t and z need reworking. They are quite illegible to the modern
    eye.
