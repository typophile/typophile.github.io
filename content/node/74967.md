  body: Doesn't look like any typeface I know. What is it from and when is it from?
    The two C's in the second sample don't quite match. It may have been hand drawn.

  body: A business forms company here in Florida closed and now we've been asked to
    reprint some statements for this Electric Company. I'm not sure how far back it
    goes.

  body: You might look at Fontek's Enviro.  The shadow and outline versions on your
    stuff look like they were one by the artist creating the stuff for the electric
    company rather than being from the original typeface itself.  The "C" is different
    between the two samples shown.
