  body: "The publisher I used to work for used C&C Offset (mentioned by Will above)
    for a fair number of titles. I was always pleased with their work and service.
    We also used Elegance in Hong Kong. But with the dollar down and fuel prices up
    (and thus freight), I'm not sure the cost differential for printing in China is
    as great as it used to be.\r\n\r\nWhen we had to keep jobs stateside (usually
    because of timing -- i.e., lost schedules), then we generally used R.R. Donnelly
    or Von Hoffman Graphics. These decisions were driven as much by existing relationships,
    costs, and delivery schedules, as anything else. But the results were always good.\r\n\r\n\"High-quality\"
    may be subjective and context-dependent, so you'll want to review samples. And
    I confess that I don't know anything regarding issues that might be specific to
    illustrated children's books.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"
