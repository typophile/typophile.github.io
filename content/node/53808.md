  body: Possibly done by hand - the "e's" in "Steve" look different. But I'd love
    to be wrong!

    and matching boots!)\r\n\r\nDrifting of the typographic element here, is that
    bag actually part of the chair?\r\n"

  body: "Yeah this is nice, i like it the way the lettering artist put this swashy
    thing on the backrest of this simple folding chair, cool. And of course McQueen
    adds style to this overall picture.\r\nI'm normally not into this swashy script
    thing, but here all elements of the photo are showing nice interactions. Next
    time i look twice at those scripts. "

  body: You know..looking at it closely..it's too ornate to be done by hand no? Would
    you write like that? It might be a font..but maybe not digitized?

  body: "<cite>Would you write like that?</cite>\r\n\r\nNot me. But Americans do.
    Check out the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2342221253/\">\u2018S\u2019
    in American Cursive</a>.\r\n\r\n<cite>it\u2019s too ornate to be done by hand
    no?</cite>\r\n\r\nI agree. Still, (a lot of) kids in the US have to learn writing
    like that. Apart from the minsucule \u2018e\u2019 with the mirrored 3 shape \u2013
    which is another American speciality \u2013 , the sample exhibits the same ductus
    as the cursives taught in school there."
