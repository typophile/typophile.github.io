body: "Hello there.\r\n\r\nI am currently writing on my BA thesis and I thought I'd
  ask for some help here. Since it's my first thesis paper and I am quite interested
  in making things look neat and clean, I wanted to ask if anybody had suggestions
  what fonts to use.\r\n\r\nMy research field is the quality debate in online market-research;
  a relatively young branch in market-research and something young and modern would
  totally fit the purpose.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I thought about using Futura Medium
  in headlines and ITC New Baskerville Roman for the text-parts. Is this a good combination?
  I tried setting the headlines bold but the bold Futura looks a bit too strong.\r\n\r\nI
  would be really grateful if someone could give me a hand in helping me to pick the
  right fonts to make my thesis paper not only good concerning quality but also neatly
  looking.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nFlorian "

    at those sizes. I wouldn\u2019t recommend any Baskerville if you aren\u2019t having
    it printed professionally; even really great laser printers can have trouble rendering
    Baskerville well enough that cranky professors with poor eyesight won\u2019t mind
    dealing with it.\r\n\r\nFutura is going to overwhelm just about any Baskerville;
    and really, the geometry of the designs just clash."

  body: "Okay, thanks! I did not even know that! So is there anything else that's
    printer-friendly and clean looking? I even thought of using MS's Office:mac 08
    Calibri & Cambria combination but I thought about this one paper where my lecturer
    was simply stunned by me using Sabon (I was trying out things though) ... and
    that's why I think it is important my thesis paper looks good.\r\n\r\nIt's clear
    to me that I want to use a sans-serif for topics and a serif font for the body.
    The body would be 12 pt and the headings probably 16 pt but I know it totally
    depends on what fonts I use.\r\n\r\nI want to 1.5-space the paper as double-spacing
    looks gross.\r\n\r\nSo ... I won't ask about my options here because I know there
    a plenty ... but are there any good combinations you already tried you could pass
    on to me?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nFlo\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: sorry, forgot to mention ...
    I'll have my paper printed out professionally as the dad of a good friend is a
    professional bookbinder and he got the machines to print out things the proper
    way!"

  body: "Florian\r\nYou just about had the proper contrast. I would use Futura Demi
    as the subhead and go to the original Monotype or foundry version of Baskerville.\r\nI
    have often used Futura demi with Garamond No. 3 for some the academic printing.
    Another thing to consider is what kind of paper your going to use. Baskerville
    for smooth finish paper and matte or vellum finish for Garamond.\r\nGood Luck"

    a selection of contemporary serif typefaces (the link is direct to a post within
    the thread). I think a modern typeface could be a nice touch, instead of using
    the usual ones like Garamond and such.

  body: Though I certainly wouldn't consider using Futura with Baskerville I will
    say that I use Monotype Baskerville for just about all my academic work. (I use
    LaTeX and XeLaTeX for pretty much everything and Word only for making notes.)
    I think Centaur is a stunningly beautiful face, particularly in the new OpenType
    version. (Nothing like metal Centaur, but still looks very nice.)

    of your school. The faculty I wrote my Masters in let you do pretty much anything
    you wanted, but every other graduate degree at my uni made you do everything (and
    I mean everything) in 12 pt Courier.\r\n\r\n3. If all else fails, use a really
    common sans for heads and a really common serif for text, particularly if your
    thesis has to be filed as a pdf or scanned into your national archive. Helvetica
    and Times are the lowest common denominators."
