body: "This is a rough sample of hhgregg's Fine Lines store logo. I'm trying to recreate
  it as a vector type logo but I don't know what fonts are being used. The font for
  hhgregg has a unique g letter but I have been unable to find what font it is. The
  font for Fine Lines is a different font, I think, that I hope someone can id. The
  web address is a third font but I don't need that font id'd. Just the Fine Lines
  and hhgregg.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance
  for any help you all can offer.\r\n\r\nDebsterbug"

  body: Thanks for the info Ryuk. In looking at DIN, all the letters are the same
    height. In my sample, it looks like the F and L are a bit taller than the others
    letters. So I'm not sure DIN is it.

  body: "Debster, the F and L are larger because someone designated them a larger
    point size. Look at the different between the stems (uprights) in the L and the
    I: the former is wider than the latter.\r\n\r\nThose crafty graphic designers
    will hornswoggle you every time, if you let \u2018em\u2026"

    this time. I have to say I''ve never heard the term hornswoggle before. I''m amazed
    at the talents of typographers. I love type but I don''t understand it all. I
    appreciate all the help from both you and Ryuk. '
