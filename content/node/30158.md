body: "I was sent this cartoon from Monday's Seattle Post-Intelligencer. A typographic
  political cartoon is a rare breed indeed. It's interesting that the cartoonist assumes
  that readers know what \"sans serif\" means; in my experience, this is rarely the
  case. <a href=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/horsey/print.asp?id=1515>Original link</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cartoon20061218_5983.gif]"

  body: I'm going to get really pissed if Papyrus keeps showing up in political reads.
    It's bad enough that I hallucinate and see it when I go without sleeping, but
    when it shows up in political stuff I think I'm losing it.

  body: It would be funnier (and truer to to life) if the punchline was "...Personally,
    Sire, I like the fonts without the pointy bits."

  body: Actually, I think the most realistic punchline (although not an especially
    funny one) would be, "... Personally, sir, they all look the same to me."
