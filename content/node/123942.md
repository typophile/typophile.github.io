  body: I know it sounds peeky and my intention is clearly not to contradict Renko.
    Gotham is definitely a very good call but I rather think it's Mark Simonson's
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova|Proxima Nova]]. Gotham
    glyphs are a bit larger. Having a look to [[https://www.google.com/search?q=100+days+of+love&safe=off&hl=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=dvcLVYmpAYj1apfxgegD&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1920&bih=1061#q=100+days+of+love&safe=off&hl=en&tbm=isch&tbs=isz:l|more
    samples]] (mainly [[http://www.kerala9.com/images/wallpaper/100-days-of-love/100-days-of-love-malayalam-movie-wallpapers-hd63.jpg|this
    one]]) confirms it for me (/M for sure).
