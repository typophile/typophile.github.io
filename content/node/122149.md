  body: "Easy? You have got to be joking.\r\n\r\nFirst, the sample is ridiculously
    small. In order to do a visual database search, the letters have to be at least
    100 px tall and at a decent resolution. Your sample is neither.\r\n\r\nSecond,
    do you have any idea how many vaguely similar sans serif typefaces there are?
    Hundreds.\r\n\r\nThird, matching such a generic style of font to an actual typeface
    based on a seven-character sample is damn near impossible. The best you can hope
    for is finding something similar, or locating an interview or portfolio by the
    designer online in which the typeface is named.\r\n\r\nAfter locating a larger
    sample and using Photoshop to get a better image, my best guess is Proxima Nova
    Extra Condensed. It\u2019s a decent match to |GRAVITY|, but not so great compared
    to the other title text that precedes that frame:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/"

    Condensed would work nice and probably better considering rest of title sequence.

  body: Gotham Condensed is good for the title text that precedes |GRAVITY|, but its
    |G| is too flat on the right side to match the one on |GRAVITY| (at least from
    what I can see on the very small sample).
