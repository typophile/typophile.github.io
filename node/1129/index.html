		<div class="commentbody">To give you an idea of how_much/what_kind of &quot;literality&quot; I think might be good: like half a lemon is obviously too much, but a drop shape might be great. Like you're getting the last drop of benefit out of projects. Maybe just a drop shape between &quot;creative&quot; and &quot;squeeze&quot;, with possibly a progressive (but subtle) narrowing of the letters the closer they are to the middle. <BR> <BR>The one with the wavy bulging/squeezing letters: I think the problem with it is simply that it's too cheesy, too much squeeze ecstasy or something. Plus it looks like a suspension bridge or an audio company. <BR> <BR>As for the Windows thing: <BR>- I don't think it's very pronounced. I didn't see it. <BR>- As much as some people (like me) can't stand the beast, most layman actually like MS. But since you're a design outfit (an area of Mac-worship) the MS connotation would indeed be a negative. <BR>- Those &quot;E&quot;s don't really say much anyway. Or maybe they say tickle, but not squeeze. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just a quick piece of feedback - I prefer the double &quot;ee&quot; in  &quot;Squeeze&quot; highlighted, while Creative stands alone. Plucking out letters from both words is too symmetrical and dilutes the concept. <BR> <BR>I would also add that I think the literal route is not the best avenue to explore- you are doing a good job of bringing in the &quot;citrus&quot; concept simply by your color selection. <BR> <BR>Maybe I missed it, but did you manipulate the Q? It looks smaller than the other letters- how does it look with a proper descending tail? <BR> <BR>jb <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm back, finally. Between Kai, my 1 yr old, and progressing on some of those projects that pay the bills, I haven't had much time to focus on Creative Squeeze. <BR> <BR>The following concepts explore the &quot;Q-drop&quot; that was initiated in my last round from the concept where I embarrassingly left out the &quot;U&quot; in SQUEEZE. So I won't be winning any spelling bee's, but hopefully one of these concepts will take me into a direction that is acceptable at all necessary levels. <BR> <BR>I am personally leaning toward the Clarendon logo, as the &quot;Q&quot; has some fun personality while the logo in its entirety maintains corporate appeal</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank  you all for your intelligent and expert advice throughout this process. The crew at Typophile has supplied us with an excellent tool to sharpen our eyes and work. As of last night I have commited my business to the Clarendon logo with the &quot;Q-drop&quot;, leaving room only for minor alterations. Today, I will make any final adjustments and continue working on the Creative Squeeze stationary suite. Any last suggestions are welcome, but for now I'll address these last critiques: <BR> <BR>Fredrik and David: Yes, David, over the last 3-4 weeks there has been a great deal of time spent with pen and paper exploring multiple directions.

		<div class="commentbody">I think it's great. As for the typeface, I agree, in theory, that it's always nice to use custom type as it just makes the logo mark that more unique, but, in this case, it is the '0' that's the mark and is what allows it to stand apart.  <BR> <BR>I much prefer the bottom colors&hellip;brown is such a tough color to pull off. <BR> <BR>As for the back of the cards, will that be a die-cut? I like the idea, but I'm not sure if I like the exact same drop on both sides. It might be a bit more clever to use a different type of treatment on the back.</div>
