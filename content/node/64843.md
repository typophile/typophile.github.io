    do with the Chinese text, visually reminiscent of fat block capitals, and the
    slightly enlarged letterspacing in the Latin.\r\n\r\nReminds me of the old days
    of Soviet propaganda :-)"

  body: It appears to reveal that English takes much more space to communicate the
    same ideas as Chinese, and is thus harder to read if confined to the same amount
    of paper. Of course, in the example, this is exaggerated, because the English
    text has been allocated less space vertically.

  body: "I'm no expert, but it seems interesting how (1) they didn't try to make the
    2 scripts equal in apparent size, but matched the length of the text instead /
    made the text flow in parallel; and (2) that the 2 scripts aren't in separate
    blocks but interwoven. The Latin seems kind of like a subtitle to the Chinese.
    :)\r\nAlso, the visual hierarchy is clear: The Chinese is what leads. I wonder
    if the letterspacing in the Latin, while certainly ugly taken by itself, isn't
    basically the Latin following/echoing an aspect of the \xE6sthetic of the Chinese
    text."

    the words in english text like the 'characters' in chinese text.\r\nBut, Nina,
    I don't think it is to echo an aesthetic aspect, maybe it is because characters
    in chinese are similar to words.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    given passage in modern Chinese will have about the same character count as the
    word count of its English translation (and vice versa). If you set them both at

  body: "<cite>The style, including the palette, is Socialist Realism. It will pass.</cite>\r\n\r\nWait,
    are you including the colour scheme of gold and white on bright red in that statement?
    It's very much a Chinese aesthetic as I understand it, quite independent of any
    Socialist Realism associations.\r\n\r\nBefore Chinese began to be written horizontally
    in imitation of Western scripts, if you found a single horizontal line of Chinese
    of only a few characters in length (to fit on a horizontally-oriented sign, for
    example), it would likely be read right to left. This is an analogue of setting
    a few letters vertically in Latin\r\n\r\nL\r\nI\r\nK\r\nE\r\n\r\nS\r\nO\r\n\r\nto
    fit a vertical space.\r\n\r\nBut yes, when you start to have actual running text
    in Chinese set horizontally, it's always written left to right."

  body: "Back in the early 1970s, Columbia offered an advanced (4th-year?) course
    in Chinese devoted to learning to read newspapers (I took classical instead).
    \ Headlines were a challenge as they seemed to run any way but bottom-to-top,
    and the text often used a dense argot.  For Chinese, modern or ancient, context
    is crucial.\r\n\r\nThe modernist aspect of the \"gothic\" type is part of political
    sub-text, reinforced by the (smaller) sanserif translation.  But there's whole
    lot more to China.  Mao's calligraphy used to appear frequently, notably in the
    phrase \u4E3A\u4EBA\u6C11\u670D\u52A1 \uFF08\"serve the people\") plastered everywhere
    in the late 70s, when the effects of the Cultural Revolution were still strongly
    felt.  Many of the simplified characters -- three of the five just quoted -- are
    in fact traditional short-hand forms widely used in hand-writing, a lot of the
    reason simplified chars. can seem garish in print.  Computers now make it vastly
    easier to type Chinese, but the resolution of small screens -- I think the Chinese
    passed a billion text messages a day -- means traditional forms blob over."
