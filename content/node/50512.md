  about Suitcase Fusion for Mac OS Leopard, or any other opinions/advice about font
  management tools/software. At the moment I'm trying a free download of Suitcase
  Fusion, but haven't had a chance to organize my fonts yet. I'm currently using FontBook,
  which came installed on the system. \r\n\r\nAny and all comments welcome!"
