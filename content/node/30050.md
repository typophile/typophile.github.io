  body: "I believe that Copperplate without the Gothic is the version that's bundled
    with OSX. I'm unsure of the exact differences, but I notice the Light version
    on my system looks like a pseudo-caps, where the cap letters are heavier than
    the rest. Ugly. \r\n\r\nAs an aside: Copperplate's the typeface people <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/20502\">love
    to hate</a>. :-)"
