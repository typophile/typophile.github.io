body: "A client with a TrueType font wanted some glyphs added but were not able to
  contact the person who created it the font initially.\r\n\r\nBecause it uses has
  at least MKMK, which FontLab doesn't support, I used ttx to create a text file and
  through a combination of FontLab and the ttx file was able to add the glyphs they
  wanted.\r\n\r\nThey now want some kerning added, which I did in the ttx text file
  and recompiled. The new kerning works when the font is used in Word 2003 but NOT
  in Word 2010 or InDesign. There is SOME sort of kerning working in InDesign as I
  can see that the characters pairs listed in the font have kerning between them.
  Likewise for Word 2010, turning the kerning on and off with some text selected makes
  definite changes at some kerning pairs.\r\n\r\nThe font does have a DSIG feature
  (for that weird Word problem).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nKen"

  body: "Just realized that InDesign is showing a different kerning value than what
    is in the \"kern\" table of the ttx. For instance, the kern table shows <code>
    &lt;pair l=\"T\" r=\"o\" v=\"-143\"/&gt;</code> but InDesign's kern menu shows
    -70.\r\n\r\nSo InDesign is definitely looking at something else in the font and
    using it as kerning. I'm assuming Word 2010 is using that same thing as kerning.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for any help anyone can offer."

  body: InDesign will be using the OpenType GPOS {kern} feature kerning, rather than
    what might be in the 'kern' table. Generally speaking, it is not advisable for
    a font to contain both kinds of kerning, but some fonts include a 'kern' table
    for backwards compatibility with e.g. older versions of MS Office. The GPOS kerning
    can include class kerning and even contextual kerning; the 'kern' table is quite
    limited and due to application issues it is generally recommended to include no
    more than c.6000 pairs in the 'kern' table. This means that when fonts do contain
    both kinds of kerning, the 'kern' table will usually include only a subset of
    the GPOS kerning. A good workflow will ensure that this subset will at least use
    the same values as the GPOS kerning, but I have seen fonts such as you describe,
    in which the two differ. This might happen if, for example, GPOS kerning developed
    for OpenType versions of a font involved significant new development and revision,
    but the 'kern' table was copied from an older version, which might be done on
    purpose to avoid existing document reflow in older apps.

    alternative, and perhaps a somewhat more simple, route is to add the glyphs directly
    to the font in OTM, and to use the GUI for the mark (to mark) positioning.\r\n\r\nFEB"

  body: "Yeah, I looked briefly at the GPOS but couldn't see much by way of readily
    readable \"code\" that I could decipher  and match up with the values InDesign
    shows.\r\n\r\nNow that I read your post, John, I remember having the reverse problem
    where the class kerning I'd added to a set of fonts we upgraded wasn't working
    in Word (2003 at the time) but with the kerning table still there it was using
    that.\r\n\r\nIt might be for this particular project that I can simply remove
    the GPOS completely as they've only used the font, thus far, in Word 2003. All
    of this new work on the font is in preparation for upgrading.\r\n\r\nI'll give
    OTM a look, FEB.\r\n\r\nThanks very much for taking the time to reply guys."

    don\u2019t think the kerning values actually differ. InDesign displays kerning
    values in \u2030 of 1 em, while in a font the kerning values are relative to the
    units per em setting, in this case probably 2048.\r\n\r\n70/1000 = 143/2048"

    as an aside to many other things. Maybe someday I'll have time to really get (and
