  and regardless of the sad fact that I can't read Hanzi (chinese characters) I would
  be interested in seeing and learning from excellent examples of chinese typography,
  which right now I haven't found yet and probably couldn't even tell (badly distorted
  typefaces I saw a lot).\r\n\r\nI would be delighted if somebody could recommend
  a nicely done book and/or magazine in chinese language (preferrably mixed with english
  terms).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPhilipp\r\n"

  body: "Hi, Philipp,\r\n\r\nUnfortunately to my knowledge there hasn't been such
    a book yet. I am thinking of starting to work on something similiar to this, a
    book on chinese type design and typography, preferably published bilingually.
    But that's not gonna happen within some years I guess. \r\n\r\nType setting in
    Chinese is not as complicated as with English. There are no ligature, hyphenation
    etc. to ponder about, and not as many considerations in the process of its type
    setting. However, there are certain rules in this regard, but it would be hard
    to summarize and introduce to you in a short time. You could write to me about
    your specific situation if you want. I'll see what I can do to help.\r\n"
