  body: "58Rodeo is closer. It's based on an old typeface called Hellenic Wide which
    has come up often here. One old FontBank version is called Hefty, and Jason Walcott
    has made a newer, up-to-date font for Veer, called [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000096|Hellenic
    Wide Complete]].\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
