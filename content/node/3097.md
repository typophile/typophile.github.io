    monoliths? perhaps its a new form of surrealism, but there&#39;s better ways of
    manipulating found art to create a statement I&#39;m sure. '

  body: I guess what I mean by &#39;better way&#39; is that it seems the artist didn&#39;t
    explore many options and his &#39;statement&#39; well...its written right there
    in english. deep thought went into that one! I&#39;d say its a cop-out for an
    idea he couldn&#39;t explain. In this case why bother making the typography match
    &#40;not that it does really&#41; the painting, why bother following the paintings
    perspectives. - its mega kitch. <BR> <BR>he could have used spray paint and tagged
    it like everyone else and acheived the same &#39;statement&#39;

    <BR>Yeah. &#42;Art&#42;. <BR> <BR>&#62; he could have used spray paint and tagged
    it like everyone else and acheived the same &#39;statement&#39; <BR> <BR>But he
    didn&#39;t, because he didn&#39;t &#42;want&#42; to. Art is inherently selfish.
    Don&#39;t get me wrong, as an integral part of Life, Art has its relevance, hence
    beauty. But the money it generates is preposterous, and in a way harmful to Art
    itself. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    The idea of mass-produced junk paintings being displayed in museums I imagine
    is part of the joke. Makes me think of DuChamp and Wegman a bit &#40;not to say
    that White is in the same league necessarilly&#41;. Personally, I like art with
    a sense of humor. I wonder what he would do with a Kincaid... '

  body: ' Agree to a degree with Hrant. The money that the big names can command in
    art is definitely anti-progress. You can buy very good work for a tiny fraction
    of the work of others. However, are we not slightly biased as a group here, a
    group which has tended away from the abstract, preferring to stick with what is
    aesthetic. In that we must acknowledge our slight contempt for a medium that trades
    on ideas and not necessarily on polished output. '

  body: ' sure Hrant, calling it &#34;Art&#34; is an easy justification, and belittles
    any and all discussion, theory or critics opinion, but one must be deemed an &#34;Artist&#34;
    before you get that title. Before that your merely a painter, sculptor, ect.  <BR>
    <BR>That is why society has people like Clement Greenberg, Rosenberg, The Guggenheims.
    By your judgement, anything they&#39;ve ever had to say is worthless when they
    could have sumed it up with your words. &#34;its art&#34; <BR> <BR>So then, critical
    as I may be I&#39;m saying its not Art, its nieve. '

    is &#39;art&#39; <BR> <BR>you really can&#39;t leave the doors that open. though
    I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t mean to. point is I value what we have in society and
    how we do have views and limits, and critics who do categorize what art is.  <BR>
    <BR>so then, my critical opinion being its not art, yours that it is. and that&#39;s
    fine. but you can&#39;t tell me it is art, if I decide the result of this guy&#39;s
    work wasn&#39;t. its futile.'

  body: ' I have to agree with Hrant. Or maybe when I&#39;m finished I&#39;ll have
    agreed with Tanya. :$ <BR> <BR>Art in general, and in my opinion &#40;key phrase&#41;,
    is only the artists until it leaves their studio. Once it is on display the work
    &#40;whether Cot or Kitsch&#41; becomes that of the viewer. Those who view the
    work, everyone, will &#34;see&#34; the work through their own life&#39;s experiences.
    And because of this will like it or not like it based on this. <BR> <BR>Sure there
    are so-called and so-entitled critics of art who have a following of people that
    have happened to agree with their &#40;critic&#41; opinions on what is and what
    is not good art. And that is also not to say that some art isn&#39;t--more or
    less--obviously &#34;better&#34; art. Some artists do have &#40;and have had&#41;
    a better understanding of the human figure or how to mix their paints or how to
    use composition. But those are all technical issues.  <BR> <BR>But again it is
    all a matter of opinion. One person&#39;s kitsch is another persons prized possession. '

  body: ' in general i stick with hrant on this topic. but being a blabber mouth i&#39;d
    like to add a point: <BR> <BR>there is no real danger in leaving the doors open
    and letting the meaning of &#39;art&#39; run around our houses, living its stench
    on everything. Because being easy on this definition will only mean we&#39;ll
    accept evrything around as a possible oppurtunity for inspiration &#40;or - &#39;Art&#39;&#41;.
    It does not mean we have to be apathic about everything and let dull and mind-modular
    objects be excused as art. Each of us has his and hers own free will to see what
    is insipiring and beautiful, and what is not, so that however we define an object,
    we could see if its qualities. By opening the meaning of art to the public, instead
    of closing it in the metal zoo of the critics, we are obligated to see more in
    everything. Since everything might have artish qualities in it. <BR> <BR>The discussion
    if something is art or not seems alltogether meaningless to me. &#39;art&#39;
    is just stuff with concetrated inspiration. if you want, you can discuss those
    painting as objects and share with people the feelings they evoke in you. '
