  font is used in the english headers in a modern (2000-something) textbook teaching
  Japanese to English-speaking folks. I have seen it elsewhere too, in the english
  section of Japanese instruction manuals for instance.\r\n\r\nWhile looking around
  the net, I have found quite a few fonts that are very close to this (using WhatTheFont
  and similar services) but none of them have managed to suggest an exact match. \r\n\r\nMicrogramma
  and Eurostile are quite close, but there's no cigar involved there... An important
  detail to match is the rounded-square nature. \r\n"

  body: A pretty decent attempt, but the 'a' doesn't look right, the 'g' is way off,
    and it doesn't seem wide enough (looking at the uppercase 'H').

    is probably a font that was primarily designed for Japanese text, but it has been
    extended with latin glyphs as well.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if there is a Japanese
    equivalent of the Typophile community somewhere?\r\nThis is driving me absolutely
    batty :)"

  body: Thanks for the trust Jan. This might be [[http://fontworks.co.jp/font/classic/newrodin/L.html|New
    Rodin]] by Fontworks (font sample [[http://fontworks.co.jp/font/classic/newrodin/L.html#cont02|here]]).
    To be positive, I guess we should wait the confirmation of [[http://typophile.com/user/4504|Akira]].
    He is definitely THE specialist, the man of the situation.

  body: "Oh yes, New Rodin demibold looks ridiculously close, to the point where it
    might actually be the correct one even. Thank you very much Ryuk.\r\n\r\nI'll
    let this simmer for a while to see what Akira says, but otherwise it looks like
    you've nailed it.\r\n\r\nEdit: Been checking the details, and I'm positive that
    Ryuk is correct. First post updated with credits. /edit\r\n\r\n\r\n"
