body: "Heya,\r\n\r\nCheck out this awesome typesetting on Okkervil River's 'Black
  Sheep Boy'\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure the face is Century Expanded\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/12811/centuryexpandedroman-font.html#more\r\n\r\nAnd
  it looks like it has a custom double keyline that i guess the designer drew by hand.\r\nAnyone
  got any good ideas on how to do this?\r\n\r\nI had a crack at converting to outlines,
  expanding the path then adjusting beziers around the serifs and fine detail, but
  this was fairly time consuming, and not entirely accurate (really difficult to get
  uniform spacing between each keyline.  (i was using Adobe Illustrator btw.)\r\n\r\nAnyone
  got any ideas on how to do this?\r\nAnd who can confirm it is in fact Century Expanded?\r\n\r\nCheers
  - Jonny"

  body: "The trick is to outline the type with different stroke widths. The original
    type is plain white with no stroke. Copy and Paste in Back, then apply a 1 point
    black stroke. Copy and Paste in Back, then apply a 2 point white stroke. Copy
    and Paste in Back, then apply a 3 point black stroke. Copy and Paste in Back,
    then apply a 4 point white stroke.\r\n\r\nTry different stroke widths for finetuning
    the effect."

  body: "Comparing the Okkervil River at the top of the sample with Centry Expanded
    it doesn't quite match. The serifs are more round in Century. Looks like Clarendon
    is a match to me.\r\n\r\nNice easy Illustrator tutorial Yves def the fastest way
    to do that technique is by applying stroke."

  body: "metafourik - Right you are.  I noticed that too, but couldnt find anything
    with slabbier serifs (didnt see clarendon).  Cheers!\r\n\r\nBaldCondensed - Of
    course!  How easy is that.  See, i jibes me that Illustrator's stroking can be
    messy - it strokes the centre of the path, there isnt control to stroke inside
    or outside like you can on a selection with PSD.  But what an easy solution: whack
    an unstroked layer of text over the top, which goes over the top of the messy
    interior stroking that always screws the form of glyphs up.  Problem solved.  Cheers!\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'There is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/newfeatures.html#nf7">expanded
    stroke options</a> in Illustrator CS2: You can stroke inside the path, stroke
    evenly on both sides of the path, or you can apply the stroke on the outside of
    the path. When I saw the new stroke options in CS2, I was like THANK YOU Adobe,
    and then I was like wait...YOUR WELCOME for the $$$ I had to spend for new stroke
    options.'

  body: Using the <strong>appearance</strong> feature/panel in Illustrator you can
    very easily create this effect with a single setting. Putting the stroke(s) behind
    and in front of the fill layer.

  body: By the way, to use the <strong>appearance</strong> panel, you'll have to outline
    the type before you can add another stroke, correct me of I'm mistaken. :)
