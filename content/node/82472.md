  looks like a modified [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/stratum1/|Stratum
  1]], but I similar personality in a typeface like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/148420CAV1_5133.jpg]\r\n\r\nAre
  those little points added in by the designer, or are there existing typefaces like
  that?"

  body: Ah, okay, thanks David.  I was just wondering if there are existing typefaces
    out there that have that style. If multiple designers are modifying fonts in the
    same way, there should be some.  Know of any?

    for the specific project. \r\nPS. The 'Cavalier' type looks pretty underdeveloped,
    so on those grounds it perhaps was drawn specifically for this project."

  body: Thanks so much guys - I didn't realize there was a term for this type of median/Tuscan
    style spur.  None of the examples from MyFonts matched exactly, so maybe someone
    should create a proper gothic typeface with these spurs.
