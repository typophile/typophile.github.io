body: "Hello all interested readers,\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been working on a script, build
  in Processing Java, that enables me to draw lines on another line. I created a \"skeleton\"
  as a typeface in XY-code. These lines will connect other lines that will give some
  sort of weight to the shapes. \r\n\r\n\r\nVisual example of the story I am telling
  above this line:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lijnoplijn_6665.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough
  a device that I build I can send values (from 0 till 1023 because of the 10k system)
  to my serial port (USB). I attached 4 potentiometers to my IO-board that I will
  use to remodel the shapes I show above. I also have a red button to make a tiff
  file.\r\n\r\nhere's a small preview of that device I built:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/post_01_6310.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  programmed the software to give the shorter lines, as you can see at the top of
  this topic, an variable angle. This angle is based on the input of the potentiometers.
  I can also make the lines larger so that it creates a bolder version. \r\n\r\nI
  just drag one end of the line and change the XY-position. This wil result in: changing
  the angle and the total lenght of the line itself. \r\n\r\nI also wanted to program
  an italic function for the whole letter. I didn't want to just angle the entire
  shape, I wanted to make a \"good\" italic.\r\n\r\nIt took me some math skills, and
  a lot of time to program it. I also connected the value of a potentiometer to the
  italic function, so you can shape it all by turning the knobs.  \r\n\r\n*No keyboard
  or mouse involved, except for typing your texts*\r\n\r\n\r\nI also managed to let
  the serifs \"shrink\" as the italic kicks in.\r\n\r\nItalics:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/post_02_3517.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  results:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/post_typecontroller_3668.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/post_typecontroller2_5232.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/post_typecontroller3_6317.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  hope that this topic will generate a discussion that will help me to expand the
  functions."

  body: I don't understand any of the technical stuff, but that thing is seriously
    cool! As for expanding the functions, how about some general size knobs (height,
    width), colour knob, rotation knob (so you can make a <a href="http://www.pilcrowtype.com/blog/archives/114">rotalic</a>).
    If you could make different sizes of type in different colours, this would be
    a neat way to produce flyers or posters etc.

    it would be nice to build in a height and width function. I already thought about
    colour and rotation, but I don't want to make a \"design machine\" of it. I think
    colour could be fun, but rotation is, for my taste, a bit to much. \r\n\r\nWhen
    I push the red button the scripts writes a vector PDF of the typed and modelled
    letters. So I can do advanced tricks in Indesign/Illustrator with the letters.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Bruno <cite>- Is the top of the italic a still a combination of two lines

    -</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I do is lower (or rise) one end of the line when I turn
    the knob. I programmed the lines so that there's always a connection between the
    lines. So when you make an italic, the lines stick together, thanks to this line
    of code:\r\n\r\ny = 100 - range; // 100 is x height\r\n\r\nrLine( 20 , 100 , 70+
    range*(100-y)/60 , y );\r\nrLine( 20+range , 40 , 20 , 100 ); //range is controlled
    by knob\r\nrLine( 20+range , 40 , 70+range , 40 ); //range is controlled by knob\r\nrLine(
    70+range , 40 , 70 , 100 ); //range is controlled by knob\r\nrLine( 70 , 100 ,
    80 , 100 ); \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you draw it on a, for example, grid paper you will
    see the appearing of an 'a'. The range part will change the values by adding up.
    \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n70+ range*(100-y)/60 , y )\r\n\r\n        =\r\n\r\n70+
    59*(100-y)/60, y // 59 will be the range data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope I answered
    your question correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your input."
