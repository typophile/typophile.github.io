body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\npardon my screaming ignorance, but you can make the width
  of all glyphs in a certain font equal? The Font I'm trying to digitize is New Deco
  by my talented colleague Ivan Hristov.\r\n\r\nI've learned a bit about Kerning Classes
  in FontLab, now I wonder if there's something like Metric Classes, plus I'm no good
  in figuring it out just by guessing :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gallery_1247_5511.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso,
  any ideas how to make a default line height for that same font as tiny as the inter-char
  spacing?\r\n\r\nAny help will be greatly appreciated"

    width?\r\n\r\nMake sure you choose a width value that will divide nicely many
    times, e.g 1024, not 1000.\r\nThis will help rasterization."
