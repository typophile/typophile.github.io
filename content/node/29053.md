    for type designers unknown to graphic designers, unknown to other type designers,
    or unknown to Typophiles? Those are three levels of increasing knowledge.\r\n\r\nHere
    are those that first come to my mind:\r\n[[Hubert Jocham]], [[Laura Meseguer]],
    [[Xavier Dupre|Xavier Dupr\xE9]], [[Alan Greene]]."

  body: "Terry,\r\n\r\nInteresting topic. When I think of it I wonder why it hasn't
    appeared earlier? Anyway, how do graphic designers or design oriented people define
    whether a type designer is underrated or not? By their appearance in articles
    etc or by having their typefaces used in work. It would be fun to have some questions
    like this in a survey done by some design magazine. I myself find it hard to pinpoint
    the word underrated... but I'm leaning toward the case where someone who makes
    quality products and is fairly known, but seldom used by graphic designers. On
    the other hand some type designers are having less time to make commercial faces
    because they work more with custom type."

    (by graphic designers)? Xavier Dupr\xE9 and Joshua Darden were just recently in

    think they are pretty well known amongst designers and type designers alike."

    between a bundled font and an OEM font.\r\n\r\n<em>does anyone do royalties on
    custom font work?</em>\r\n\r\nIt's not about royalties, but about fair value.\r\nOne
    of the financial considerations made by corporations (and governments) that commission
    custom fonts is to compare the cost of licensing a retail font for their multiple
    workstations, with the cost of commissioning a proprietary design.\r\n\r\n<em>it\u2019s

    contracted talent doesn't get OEM \"points\" in this business, but that is the
    result of corporate concentration, nothing to do with gambling. One can still
    imagine how things might be without the virtual monopoly exercised by a handful
    of computer companies. \r\n"

    \r\nThe MRSP I was referring to is retail font price, not the cost of Vista. The
    idea that people actually buy font licences may seem somewhat bizarre at MS, but
    indulge me please, it's the reality for most type designers.\r\nSay an OpenType
    font family of four styles retails for $100.\r\nWhen an independent foundry sells
    a licence for that, the type designer makes $30 - $90, depending on whether the
    sale is \"foundry direct\" or through a distributor.\r\nHowever, when the same
    designer's OT family is bundled with Vista, the designer will end up making what,
    a couple of cents per installed family? \r\nMunch et al are great philanthropists
    :-)"
