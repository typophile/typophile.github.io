  \r\nTake one noun and one adjective to make a 'word pair.' Basically we are making
  what might be a logotype.\r\n \r\nNo use of additional shapes is allowed.\r\n \r\nNo
  changes of the letterform design are allowed. (Scale and rotation are allowed, but
  no subtraction or addition of points/shapes)\r\n \r\nConsiderations:\r\n- find similarities
  in letter forms, possible ligatures, descenders/ascenders\r\n- look for unique relationships
  between the letter forms and the words\r\n- find more than one typographic relationship\r\n-
  vary baselines, type sizes (scale), typefaces\r\n- use proper kerning and tracking\r\n-
  maintain legibility\r\n- maintain balance\r\n- keep each word's individality through
  hierarchy or contrast\r\n- do not have a letter do \"double duty,\" using one letter
  for both words\r\n- do not make pictures out of your words\r\n \r\nNOW, the argument
  I have with my instructor is this:\r\nThe students are being told to do this using
  InDesign. I however feel that this is a task better suited for Illustrator.\r\n
  \r\nI would like to know what the feeling is here on the forums...\r\n \r\nCan you
  explain which would be better and why?"

  body: "I would definitely use InDesign. This is an exercise in working with type,
    which InDesign does with more precise control and more relevant features than
    Illustrator, which is not a typography program. Especially as you are not altering
    the lettershapes, I don't see a reason to use Illustrator. As a designer, I feel
    InDesign is my default; I use it whenever possible, especially for anything involving
    type. The only time I would use another program is if InDesign literally is unable
    to do what I need \u2014 which really is not very often. Also, if that is the
    assignment, then that limitation, along with all the others, is probably there
    for a reason. I'm interested in why you feel Illustrator would be a more appropriate
    choice."

    that this is a Layout Problem and InDesign does it best.

    Adobe Whatever is NOT design...\r\n\r\nYou could use Inkscape, Scribus and even
    a fax & scissors and still be a designer.\r\n\r\nOr it is already Adobe Classroom
    in a Minds from school?"

    more than InDesign and tended to use it whenever possible. "

    sort of projects with markers and scissors. After that, no one really cared what
    programs were used to produce stuff.

    What happened to teaching us the basic elements of design, old-school? '

  body: Truth be told, back in school, I've secretly done quite a bit of my typesetting
    in Photoshop, resorting to InDesign/Quark only for multi-page projects, and almost
    completely bypassing Illustrator. Even when a vector logo was called for, I'd
    sketch out the initial version in PS and trace the result in IL afterward. Somehow,
    pixel-pushing felt comforting. It wasn't until my first internship, that I started
    to value vector work and a degree of automation in typesetting controls. Naturally,
    I never confessed this to any of my instructors.

    good design education should definitely focus on design, not software. \r\n\r\nBut
    a working knowledge of the commonly-used design programs (InDesign, Photoshop,
    Illustrator, etc) is important too.  Just look at the job requirements for most
    entry-level design positions. A graduate who doesn't know how to use those programs
    may have a tough time finding a job."

  body: Considering that it's two words, Illustrator is more suited. When you start
    working with a body of text, InDesign is more suited, but that's not the case
    here. My rule of thumb is that if it's one page use Illustrator, if the project
    is more than one page use InDesign.
