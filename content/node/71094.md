body: "This is a DVD cover for a client who's giving advice to caregivers to minimize
  their stress and help them care for their own needs. Their patients are physically/mentally
  disabled adults - some elderly, some young with brain injuries from war.\r\n\r\nI
  wanted a very legible and dignified but soft and friendly font - not so easy to
  find - so I chose Eigerdahls, a recent release.\r\n\r\nThe client described the
  concept she wanted in the illustrations, using a couple of clip art things from
  Word - a contrast between the stressful, hectic \"Before\" and calm \"After\". She
  was vague about the design though. I came up with this. She was pleased with it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/what
