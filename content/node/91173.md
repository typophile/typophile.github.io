body: "Hello everybody and regards from Switzerland.\r\nI am in the process of rewriting
  some websites for friends, personal business and family, and would like to integrate
  some of the new @font-face techniques in my CSS.\r\nBeing that I am not a typographer
  by trade or schooling I had really never thought much about usage rights, licensing,
  etc.\r\nAs of yesterday, let's say that I wanted to use, say, Century Gothic - I'd
  just code it in my CSS, and specify the fallback alternatives and that was it.\r\nSo
  if I'm coding my CSS to instruct the browsers to call up that specific font which
  is installed on the users' machines, there is no problem because the licensing fees
  have been paid by the OS manufacturer (and/or the computer manufacturer as well?).\r\nOn
  the other hand if I'm using the @font-face declaration, and have a copy of the font
  stored locally on my server space I would need to pay licensing rights, (except
  if it's a free-font). Would this apply even in the case that the @font-face url
  is on a third-party server (e.g. the font designer's own site)?\r\n\r\nThank you
  for your kind help!\r\n\r\nCiao, tsch\xFCss, a bient\xF4t\r\n\r\nPaul"

    license. A normal \u201Cprint font license\u201D usually won't suffice)\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nWould
    this apply even in the case that the @font-face url is on a third-party server
    (e.g. the font designer's own site)?\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nOf course! \r\nKeep in
    mind that some browsers even have a same-origin rule for @font-face linking, so
    the font file must be on your server (or delivered from a webfont service provider)
    to even work on your site. Hot-linking is not a way to go. "

  body: "Thank you Ralf  - I hadn't thought about the \"print font license\" vs. webfont
    aspect. One more thing to worry about.\r\n:-/\r\n(by the way are emoticons allowed
    on a typography webforum? ) \r\n\r\nLooking at the CSS of this site (e.g. font:14px
    \"Georgia\",Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; etc): does this mean that the
    webfont usage rights are being paid for all those single typefaces, even though
    I may be using my own browser-specific stylesheet to display a totally different
    font?\r\nTo me this is where it gets really confusing.\r\n\r\nThank you for your
    patience and help,\r\n\r\nPaul"

    with common operating systems</a>.  If one doesn\u2019t have the first installed,
    the browser uses the next, or in the end if none are present uses the standard
    \u201Csans-serif\u201D defined in your system. No font files are served, it just
    use the fonts that are already on your computer."

  body: "Paul,\r\nfont:14px \"Georgia\",Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; \r\n\r\nthese
    fonts are pre-installed on almost each computer of the world and no webfont is
    loaded, but the font installed on your <strong>local</strong> Operating System.\r\nthe
    above declaration just says : \u201Cuse Georgia, if installed on the local computer;
    if there is no Georgia, look for Verdana instead; if no Verdana, look for Helvetica
    then [\u2026], if no font found, use de default sans-serif/serif\u201D.\r\nWith
    this logic, you can set a font, hoping people has installed it (for instance Myriad
    / Myriad Pro, installed with every Adobe product). \r\n\r\nfont-family: Myriad,
    \"Myriad Pro\", Trebuchet, sans-serif;\r\n\r\nthis means :  \u201Clook for Myriad,
    if not present for Myriad Pro, if not present Trebuchet, if not present a generic
    sans-serif\u201D.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be sure people see your website in Myriad,
    you should embed it as a webfont. Only browsers unable to read webfonts will use
    the fallback fonts in the list.\r\n\r\n3 obvious consequences :\r\n1. there is
    no sense paying for 2 webfonts where the 2nd is the 1st fallback.\r\n2. the fallback
    font should be a <em>standard font</em>, installed by default on Win, Mac, and
    possibly Linux. You can find many web pages listing them. Here one of them : [[http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html]]
    \ \r\n3. you, as the publisher, pay a licence to have the right to display your
    website with an X webfont. Probably, if you use a service like typekit (based
    on pageviews), if the internet user applies his own style sheet and disables javascript,
    he wouldn't be counted in the total page views of your font. But I guess it\u2019s
    the 0,01% of cases."
