  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m referring to the modern sans used for text such as &#34;A4 vs.

  body: I think I&#39;ve answered this one for myself. I believe it&#39;s <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=406860">Monark</a>,
    from T-26. If anyone wants to disagree, I probably won&#39;t argue with you. <IMG
