  body: "This looks like a very heavy version of the metal typeface Baskerville Bold,
    shown in Mac McGrew's book on American Metal Typefaces. I looked through the FontBank
    collection for a heavy Baskerville, and didn't find anything close. I am still
    looking through the McGrew book, hoping that this is an old metal face. Then I'll
    look at the Phil's photo book.\r\n\r\nWhat is the age of this sample?\r\n\r\n-
