body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nAs I analyise type more and more I am continually finding myself
  liking \r\n\r\ncertain ways specific characters are written/formed/used.\r\n\r\nFor
  example\r\n\r\nT could be represented by turning \"L\" 180degees to form a half
  T you could call it, or a H and remvoing one of its side walls and depending on
  the next letter for that side wall to form the letter.\r\n\r\nThese sort of combinations,
  possibilities, just wondering if someone out has a chart showing such possibilities
  for each character etc\r\n\r\nBe interested to learn about such combinations as
  I explore finding my own.\r\n\r\nAny help would be great"
