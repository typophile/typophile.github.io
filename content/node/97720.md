  old Open signs for awhile so I thought I'd throw this up and see if anyone can ID
  it. Thanks so much Typophilers!\r\n\r\n"

    (which is inspired by the classic OPEN signs, which used custom lettering, not
    a font).\r\n\r\nWhere did you see the poster? Part of the Obama campaign gear?"

    me. \r\n\r\nThe poster popped up on Facebook. It wasn't \"official\" I dont' think
    but certainly beautiful. Reminds me (though opposite in emotional content) to
    the Young Jerks \"Sorry, but we're OCCUPIED\" poster from early this year.\r\n\r\nThanks
    Stephen!"

    design director for Obama for America. They're only available from the physical
    store at their headquarters in Chicago. Hopefully I'll be doing an un0numbered
    reprint after the election...\r\n"
