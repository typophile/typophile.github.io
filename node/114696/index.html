  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Typophiles!
I am looking for a so called "neutral" typeface. I know there is no such thing, but I need at typeface for my project that is "free from political, social and cultural connotations". Do you know about any "skeleton" typefaces that excists digitally? Not skeleton as in "skin and bone", but refering to the common ground form of a typeface.
This is a mission impossible, but I thought it could be good to try this forum.  

Any suggestions would be very much appreciated!</div>

That said, I'm often caught out by one common font in the "oh, I wasn't thinking about what the text is set in at all" stakes, namely Myriad. I think it says much less than just about any other font (neither old-fashioned nor edgy, not overly associated with a certain era or user segment, not particularly many idiosyncracies).</div>

At the very least Helvetica is culturally not neutral, and thus nor is Arial. Univers was always more neutral in my opinion. It still has character, but it doesn't have such distinct letters as Helvetica does (a, R, S). I always recognize Univers by its /a but I don't think I would recognize it otherwise. Folio isn't neutral at all, is it?

I wouldn't really consider FF Kievit to be neutral either, but strangely enough it's almost exactly what comes to mind when I think of a "skeleton" typeface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps I'm slightly missing what neutrality is about. I'm starting to think to you guys neutrality is a "dry" grotesque face. At the same time though I couldn't really say what's perfectly neutral. I agree with donshottype's comment: "Some similar fonts, such as Myriad have picked up baggage. For many people Myriad now says Apple." Myriad has always been a face without much of an identity for me, but I can see how people become so familiar with a brand that a typeface suddenly says a lot more than perhaps it initially intended. For me Helvetica and Arial are at least culturally not at all neutral. We recognize both immediately and it comes with a lot of historical baggage. Arial is also the default typeface of the city I live in so Arial tends to become even less neutral for me.

But can you guys clarify what you think of when considering neutrality in typefaces? hamest mentioned he's looking for a typeface that is "free from political, social and cultural connotations". I think faces like Helvetica are not that, but perhaps an unpopular Helvetica no one is familiar with would be. I don't really understand how faces like Helvetica and especially Akzidenz Grotesk pop up here though. What I think of when considering "neutrality" and "skeletal" is a typeface stripped down from the essentials. Not a geometric typeface, but a clean grotesque. No spurs. As I mentioned Univers is quite neutral to me. I don't find Folio neutral at all because of those strange counters. I like it, but it's far from neutral. So perhaps you reason neutrality differently?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To pick up the thread from Martin, how "skeletal" a grotesque is Helvetica really? I mean, some of its features are very distinct and extreme, far from neutral. I'm thinking of the extremely closed counters and ultra-consistently horizontal/vertical terminals, for instance. My take is that Miedinger was primarily concerned with logical consistency and esthetic purity (which may be the same thing), not neutrality in the sense of being unintrusive.

(Univers has a similar thing going, and has the distinctive thing where bolder cuts have more contrast than most grotesques. Avenir, which of course is not a grot, is more "neutral" in the unobtrusive sense to my eye. Myriad is of course close to a copy of it.)</div>

I know. That's why I have no idea why the first typefaces people mention are Folio, Helvetica and Arial and every other person after that seems to agree. Helvetica and Arial are not free from social and cultural connotations and Folio is simply not neutral stylistically. I think we're caught up in old grotesque faces rather than considering actual neutrality.</div>

That's exactly my thinking. I can see how you can argue that Helvetica has a certain neutrality or clinical look, but that's different from the kind of neutrality (skeletal) we're after. Strip Helvetica's character down and you have a neutral typeface. Get rid of the vertical leg in /R and the curvature from the bowl to the spine in /a for starters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, why do you say it's averaged neutrality? It's just an average. That's very different from neutrality, even if averaging techniques may be applied to eventually get to a form which may be perceived as neutral. The output of these averaging techniques depend on the input and since the input isn't necessarily neutral, you can't expect the outcome to be. To get to neutrality you need human eyes and rationality. If all typefaces are like circles and true neutrality is like a triangle, then by taking the average of all those circles you will never get to a triangle. It will give insights into the common ground of typefaces which will probably make it easier to create a neutral skeleton because it restricts the area it can live in, but the averaging technique is just a tool and is not a showcase of neutrality.

		<div class="commentbody">Martin, I would say that averaging, cleaned up a little, is as good a method of targeting neutrality as any other.

However, what I really believe is that the ﬁsh is not aware of the water.
So, considering that power laws (e.g. Lotka’s) operate in cultural markets, the most neutral or invisible typeface will be that which is most used for the kind of document and layout in which it appears, for the given readership demographic.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not entirely convinced. We would have to assume that most of the typefaces we use as input are of the perfect proportions and weight to be neutral in order to target actual neutrality. I believe Spiekermann stated somewhere that all typefaces are about 17% different from each other, which would mean that the essential skeleton you're targeting is the remaining 83%. I don't understand how that can be used to target neutrality. I think targeting neutrality is a rational process.

I certainly agree that neutrality is contextual as well. A renaissance bible in Univers would be anything but neutral, contextually.</div>

Yes, DTL Fleischmann is close... just not close enough for somebody who's interested in original intent. It clearly shies away from reviving the Didone "o", the diminutive bowls on the ascending letters, and other such idiosyncratic –and telling– design decisions.

This is arrogant nonsense. 
The designer made decisions, the result is convincing. What about it?

		<div class="commentbody">Kaiser's Fleischmann is not only an excellent typeface, it is the most convincing Flesichmann revival to date. But what I'm saying cannot in fact be applied to any revival; this is a rare case where I believe something valuable has failed to be revived. Virtually all revivals are either accurately faithful, or discard aspects that were –or have largely become– pointless. In contrast, I think aiming for higher readability is ever-relevant, and this particular opportunity has yet to be grasped.

Did Kaiser play it safe (as I suspect), was he wary of reviving an aspect he did not himself sufficiently understand, or did he think the deviation in the original was simply a bad idea? That is the interesting question – it reflects not only on an individual designer but on how the market shapes culture.
