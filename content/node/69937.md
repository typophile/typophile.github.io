body: "Selling my House Industries 10 Year anniversary book. The book is in excellent,
  like-new condition, although my name is written in the front. Original sleeve included.
  More information about the book is here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/objects/books/housetenyearbook\r\n\r\nAlso
  included is a large stack of House catalogs, from the very early days to now (a
  random, incomplete collection, all in good to great condition).\r\n\r\nThe book
  is currently out-of-print. Please make a reasonable offer for the book and catalogs.
  I'm assuming shipping will be $15 to $20 for Priority in the U.S.\r\n\r\n"
