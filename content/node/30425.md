  body: on first sight I would have said that it is some kind of a bastardised version
    of gill sans - perhaps a faux-italic version. although when i examine it further
    it is prob not (the negative space on the loop of the 'g' and is that an inkwell
    in the 'z'?) I'm sure Stephen will be along soon enough to correct me though :)

  body: gill was my first try, but the "a" is much more warm...

  body: "I'd say it seems too monotone to be Optima, but I don't have an alternative
    idea. I was going to say obliqued Today Sans, but I can see, on closer comparision
    that the 'a' and 'g' shapes are not right.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
