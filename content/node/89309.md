  if anyone might be able to prove me wrong. This is from a form at a <a href=\"http://www.riverviewtheater.com/\">movie
  theater</a>, and is used for their logo.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://mproud.com/images/riverview.jpg\"
  width=\"100%\">\r\n\r\nBonus points if you can find a font similar to this one that
  could pass as an unofficial replacement."
