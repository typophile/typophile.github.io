  and give it a background colour and padding? I'm designing a book, and the client
  has explicitly asked for this, and across several hundred pages, it'll be a complete
  pain to draw them manually...\r\n\r\nin hope rather than expectation!"

  body: Well, text boxes can themselves have a fill color as well as a text color.
    However, if it's only certain paragraphs that need the background color, the best
    way would be to set-up a paragraph style that has a big, fat rule assigned to
    it in the color you desire. You can have the rule offset so as to center the text
    within the rule.

  body: "Dux,\r\n\r\nFisheye has the right idea. I don't have the time to explain
    everything in detail, but if you give a paragraph a thick Rule Below, and offset,
    that is the length of the text it will cover the background issue. You can then
    apply a left and right indent to the paragraph, however I am not sure what will
    happen to the rule... \r\n\r\nActually, instead of Rule Below, you can try underline,
    and apply the same thick underline as you would in Rule Below. I think that will
    respect the indents in relation to the text box. And you can do this through a
    style sheet. "

  body: 'I would insert a mini-table consisting of one row/one column (= one single
    table cell), cut the text and then paste it into the cell. With the help of the
    table palette you can easily set rules on all 4 sides, as well as text offsets,
    etc. '
