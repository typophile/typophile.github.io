  one I can find with an 'A' with that backward serif, and it obviously isn't that.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RushallMews.jpg]\r\nAnd
  bonus typo-blunder: Poor old MEWS! I wonder how often this sort of thing happens,
  and how many people would notice?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    or other wise flipped.\r\n\r\nor b.) was done on purpose for some sort of mish-mashed
    effect like with the MEWS."

  body: I think it's highly unlikely to be intentional. I think the guy on the ladder
    with the glue just grabbed what looked like an 'M' and bunged it on, which meant
    the 'W' was always going to be wrong too. At least he got the first 'S' right.

  body: "We used to have a similar sign for a bank here in Gent which read \"GEMEENTEKREDIET\",
    and about every possible letter was flipped or rotated. Quite a sorry sight. I
    still regret never having taken a picture.\r\n\r\nYour sample is quite similar
    to <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.94.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=RUSHALL+MEWS&sampleSize=32\">Plantin</a>."

  body: Just checked Rookledge's, but no luck finding it by earmark -- none of them
    have the top serif on both uc A and W.

    I carry my camera with me everywhere I go now, because you never know when a sign
    like that's going to come up.\r\n\r\nThanks again."
