  in my profile &mdash; so go easy.\r\n\r\nA while back I inherited the tedious upkeep
  on a minor project that has forever used a LOT of Helvetica fake small caps. It's
  just as awful as you think, and I can't stand it anymore. But I don't have the authority
  to completely overhaul the card.\r\n\r\nI've tried some other sans-serifs with true
  small caps, but most of them are humanist and thus all wrong. I've found that you
  can get  [[http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.htm?pid=423642|an SC font of Akzidenz
  Grotesk]], but it leaves me feeling \"Ennh.\"\r\n\r\nAre there any realist sanses
  out there with nice-looking small caps?"

    I'm a newbie, I've never seen a GX font in person before. Are they backwards-compatible
    with vanilla TrueType? Or do you have to basically have FontLab to use them these
    days?\r\n\r\n> Although it\u2019s a little quirkier than\r\n> Helvetica, National

    only problem is that there's a dark side to my situation. I'm a lone design-conscious
    mercenary in a company that epitomizes design bankruptcy.\u2020 There's a very
    large central repository of fonts we're licensed to use, but we don't have direct
    access to it; instead, we have to contact a representative who searches the repository
    for us.\r\n\r\nMy point is that I can't just buy a font from any foundry; I have
    to find something that we're already licensed to use.\r\n\r\nAnd my REAL point
    is that National, while an excellent candidate that I'm glad to know about, is
    a no-go, so I'd still like more suggestions if anyone has them. :)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2020
    You can probably guess the company in about three tries (but I beg you not to
    try). \r\n\r\n"

    I mean Heros! \r\n\r\nAdventor is a geometric sans-serif, and is in fact a rip-off
    of Avant Garde. But Heros is a realist sans-serif, and is in fact a rip-off of
    Helvetica. And it does have small caps!\r\n\r\nIf we didn't have a license to
    the whole extant Helvetica family, I'd feel funny about using any of those. But
    we do, so I won't. :)  Thanks!"

  body: "I took a look at Heros -- the small caps are OK, but would need a slight
    weight increase to match my Helvetica (but the accents over them should not have
    the weight increase). They also needed to be a touch larger; a small amount of
    vertical scaling would fix that.\r\n\r\nThe old style numbers seem to just be
    the regular numbers \"moved\" a bit, except, obviously, for the \"1\" and \"2\".
    The oldstyle \"2\" is just dreadful.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I don't think you could
    just use them directly with another foundry's Helvetica.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    Heros. :)\r\n\r\nI know Heros isn't just spectacular; I don't like a few random
    features of some letters, and I could tell the small caps weren't perfect. But
    I'm not using the text figures at all (for which I think I have good reasons),
    and anything like a close approximation of true small caps is a drastic improvement,
    even with Heros's cons.\r\n\r\nAs far as mixing weights of Helvetica, well...
    that looks really good. I'm using InDesign CS, though, and I don't know of a way
    to have it automatically use a different font for the small caps. There's just
    enough text with just enough caps to make it really tedious to tweak the type
    manually.\r\n\r\nI'll have to consider it, though, because now that I look at
    them side-by-side, the Helvetica one is far, far superior. Thanks. :)"
