  body: Hello again, sorry I was totally wrong in fact the real name is Metrolis and
    was design by Foundry - Freda Stack and David Quay. Metrolis have few weigths
    because this work was commission by Wolff Olins &#40;Portgual-Lisbon&#41; to a
    exclusive use so you will find only the regular, italic, bold and the respective
    signs. To clearify better the ideia Bliss was design by Jeremy Tankard and he
    devolopment a special version &#40;PT-Bliss&#41; to the Portuguese Telecom company.
    Funny every day I take the Lisbon Underground and this typeface is very familiar
    to me and probably you almost see me making my type correction in side of the
    train. ;&#41; One more time sorry about the mistake. I just arrived at home and
    I only now check the information. <BR> <BR>Um abra

    Metro, Taxis, Parking, pass cards, etc. and for the Line Symbols.\r\n\r\nThere
    are actualy more than four symbols (in the original 1993 Metro expansion plan,
    they planned six lines, including Orange and Purple) \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ml_5269.jpg]\r\nhttp://pwp.netcabo.pt/0659437901/ml.jpg\r\n\r\nBut
    at the moment there are just four different lines: \r\n\u2014 Linha Azul (Blue
    Line) or Linha da Gaivota (Sea Gull line)\r\n\u2014 Linha Amarela (Yellow Line)
    or Linha do Girassol (SunFlower Line)\r\n\u2014 Linha Verde (Green Line) or Linha

    me tell you something: I\xB4m looking for this font for almost 8 years...\r\nIs
    a beautifully designed font, it's distinctive, simple, it reads well, and it\xB4s
    a strong brand element of Metropolitano de Lisboa.\r\nBut some other companies
    got it as well, like a chain of Pizza restaurants, a brand of Cheese an a Condominium
    Management company."

    some brochures. I thought it was made by portuguese hands. If you ever have a
    chance to visit lisbon, visit the "Picoas" (the Metro has there HQ just outside)
    and "Orient" stations :-)
