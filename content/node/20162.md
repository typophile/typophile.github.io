body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nThis is probably going to be the most generic question ever,
  but I'm looking for a typeface for a rebrand of a store I'm going to be working
  on. The current identity is very similar to ITC's Edwardian Script (ugh!), and the
  company doesn't want to move too far away from it. I've always been a bit cautious
  towards scripts, I rarely use them because I've always felt that they're usually
  far too fiddly for identity work, have a tendency to fill in and aren't particularly
  easy to read, as well as being old-fashioned for my purposes. Can anyone suggest
  contemporary, script faces that are elegant but are thicker than Edwardian Script?
  I'm also open to suggestions of italicised serif display faces that look modern.\r\n\r\nI
  know it's all a bit woolly and I've not narrowed things down, but I'm hoping I might
  discover some fantastic new faces and/or foundries that can get me going in the
  right direction.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nSi"

    I let you guys know what's hitting the mark - it's pretty rude of me otherwise...\r\n\r\nI've
    just had chance to have a good look at the foundries...\r\nwww.sudtipos.com seems
    to be hitting the mark, they look pretty modern and have heaps of personality.
    I'm a fan of Affair Script, Brisa, Suave Script, I'll have to develop my ideas
    more and make my choices. At the moment, I'm just doing the groundwork - unfortunately
    I can't post how I'm getting on on the critique board, am not allowed to :(\r\n\r\nCheers
    again for all your contributions,\r\n\r\nSi"

    too fine for my needs (and a bit too classical); also I'm a really big fan of

    like to use them in the future!\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "Doesn't it matter what the store's image is and what it sells, even if confidentiality
    requires that to be expressed at a certain level of generality?\r\n\r\nDo people
    really feel comfortable about suggesting typefaces without knowing anything about
    the history of a business, its current products and its intended customers?\r\n\r\nFor
    example, yesterday somebody asked for advice on type for model/toy railroad accessories,
    and someone named Mark Simonson made what seemed to me to be some pretty important
    points about how history and the product and the geographic location of the customer
    might have a bearing on choice of type. To me, what he had to say made a lot of
    sense, applicable to any enterprise.  \r\n\r\nJust curious. "

    wanted some new foundries and lot of alternatives, so he could make the decision
    himself. And he already narrowed the field quite a bit."

  body: "Sorry Redge, you're right, but Grot Esqu\xE9 (I wish I'd thought of that
    name!) answered for me. The store is old, with very fragmented, inconsistent branding
    (that seems to have been amended by different signwriters on the few different
    branches of the store). As for what it sells, the store is quite upmarket and
    sells a very diverse range of homewares. The store has heritage but needs to be
    brought up-to-date considerably.\r\n\r\nI'm going to be presenting multiple approaches,
    so I'm keeping my options open. Really I was using the thread to discover new
    foundries/faces - If I don't use them for one option, I can always bring them
    into play elsewhere. I tend to work on identities frequently, so I like to keep
    on top of what's out there.\r\n\r\nSi"
