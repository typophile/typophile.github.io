body: "Recently I've bought Feijoa. With this font I'm creating sheet music using
  Finale (the most common software for that) in Windows. Than the result is exported
  to an EPS file. This EPS cannot be opened in Paint Shop Pro or Photoshop because
  an unclear error is given.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what to do? FontLab doesn't seem
  to find anything weird to the font. Font Creator though is giving some error. But
  even after the glyphs are validated the EPS error remains.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help?\r\n\r\nYours
  sincerely,\r\n\r\nTijs Krammer\r\n"

    know if that is an option in Finale.\r\n\r\nIf the problem persists, you should
    contact Chester at Village directly. He is a tech-wiz, and should be able to help
    you.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.vllg.com"

    error if you substitute a different font?
