  body: I made a complex dot matrix font. Some glyphs have hundreds of nodes. I generated
    an OpenType PS. On screen there are characters missing (well, there a more characters
    not visible than visible). When I print the file everything is fine. Very strange.

  body: "Actually it's not so strange, since font rendering is handled by various
    pieces of software, each with different limits. For example some printers might
    have trouble as well.\r\n\r\nThe good news in your case is that you can figure
    out your onscreen algorithm's limit by comparing the glyphs that show up versus
    those that don't.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you need to do a lot more testing,
    since presumably you're not the only person who's going to end up using the font!
    You need to aim for a configuration (on each platform) that makes sense for the
    target user of your font; as a rule of thumb, somewhat below average.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I\u2019m working on a G5 OSX 10.4.9. I tested the fonts in Illustrator and InDesign
