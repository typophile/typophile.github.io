  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As has been sometimes discussed here on Typophile, the W3C has been wrestling with some issues around how to improve handling of fonts for the Web. Nobody has really asked Web designers or font vendors/foundries about their needs.</p>
<p>I have made a relevant blog post and launched two related surveys (one of Web designers, one of font vendors).</p>
<p>The survey for Web designers/producers is here. I&rsquo;d appreciate your help in getting the word to relevant lists and forums:

<p>But the matter at hand is that the W3C is likely to go with original fonts on Web servers, and might be convinced to go with EOT as well, and that the opinions of type foundries and users might be able to influence if (in the case of EOT) and how (for both approaches) these things go down.</p>
<p>Unless the Flash SWF format were to become an open format, I don&rsquo;t think SIFR would be considered. Plus there are technical considerations as well.</p>

<p><cite>Unless the Flash SWF format were to become an open format, I don’t think SIFR would be considered.</cite></p>
<p>I don’t think that what the W3C wants really matters much anymore. The people behind Flash/Flex have their heads screwed on a lot tighter, and may be more likely to produce internet standards that designers and consumers want to work with in the long run. It’s been six years since XHTML 1.1, and I don’t see the W3C moving things forward. What Macromedia/Adobe have done in the same timespan is pretty impressive.</p>
<p><cite>What I find sad is that now that Adobe has Flash, they’re not compelled to push for SVG support like they used to.</cite></p>
<p>I don’t blame them. SVG seemed to run into the same problem a lot of commercial open-source projects do: when the open-source crowd finally gets commercial support, they don’t really contribute enough to make it worthwhile for the businesses involved. It makes more sense for Adobe to just stick with Flash and avoid the extra headaches.</p>

<p>That is funny, to me. I see your words, and I know what you&rsquo;re saying, but Adobe, MS and Apple have done many things over the decade+ of this issue&rsquo;s existence and none of them work for &ldquo;The Web&rdquo;, just for their users. why change now? Thus, this survey had little to offer me as far as questions I felt like answering. When someone asks, &ldquo;What do you, (you type designer you), need to know in order to provide a quality font to any user?&rdquo; Then we&rsquo;re cookin'. We&rsquo;re cookin' now on our own grease, but it&rsquo;ll be awhile because the fundament of tool makers had to be replaced with ones who don&rsquo;t lack for ears, eyes, noses and throats.</p>

<p>Because an influential person (Haakon Lie) has managed to get support for original fonts on web servers (via the CSS @font-face tag) built into WebKit, which means it will get picked up by Opera, and likely by Safari as well.</p>
<p>So, fonts on the web are going to happen. It&rsquo;s just become a question of exactly how. That&rsquo;s spurs reactions from companies such as Microsoft and Adobe.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;d like to see an anonymized result from the font vendor survey, as well. It seems that there would be a few font vendors, and several publishers, that were highly interested in allowing some sort of interdomain access to fonts. While this could lead to hotlinking, that is manageable. More interestingly, it could create an opportunity for &ldquo;font services&rdquo; to be provided by the font vendors to a client with a lower up front cost. As a person I prefer to buy, but to businesses, leases have advantages.</p>

<p>Not quite sure what you mean by that. Open source isn&rsquo;t good for the business of commercial software companies like Adobe, of course, as that&rsquo;s their livlihood.</p>
<p>So, yea, I can see why Adobe has no interest in supporting open standards and would rather try and own the web technology (just as MS has for so long).</p>
