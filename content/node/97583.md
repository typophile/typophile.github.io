  body: "This is a very unusual slab, it seems to me. The 'a' is most odd, because
    usually the tail curls up on Clarendon-like styles. The squared-off tail of this
    'a' looks a bit like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/donnerstag/|Donnerstag]],
    but the overall feel is closer to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/clarendon-text/|Clarendon
    Text]] from Canada Type.\r\n\r\nMaybe FindMyFont or WhatFontis tools would have
    better luck?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
