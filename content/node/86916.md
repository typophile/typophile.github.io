body: "Hi! I'm working on a school project which consists of a catalogue with Nazi
  Propaganda Posters and the info about the font used. I know that various types of
  Fraktur were used a lot until 1941, and then Antiqua (Roman) letters were the standard.
  Altough, I need some help on identifying the fonts from the posters below (some
  may be handmade, so if there is any similar font please help me).\r\n\r\nIf you
  know any other poster and font from the Nazi era propaganda, that helps too. I need
  a minimum of 18 fonts identified. Even if they are similar (like various blackletter
  font faces). Thank you a lot in advance.\r\n\r\nThe posters are the following (sorry
  if the image is too big). Every poster has a number in white or black to help identify
  the font. Example: Poster 15 - Typeface name.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again! :D\r\n\r\n<img

  inform me, and I will try to provide it.\r\n\r\n \r\n"

  body: Almost everything here was lettered by hand, standard operating procedure
    for this type of poster at the time. The sans serifs are mostly based on Futura
    (Paul Renner, 1927) and Kabel (Rudolf Koch, 1927). The blackletter-like alphabets
    are based on Fraktur, which is not one font but a family of fonts that were popular
    for German printing until the Nazis banned their use in 1941.

    hand-made, please inform me of similar fonts if you know any. ;)\r\n\r\nInside
    the Fraktur style, please tell me which fonts do you know from this period (I
    already have Fette Fraktur and Breitkopf Fraktur).\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Hi Telmo,\r\n\r\nget your hands on a copy of \u2018Blackletter: Type and
    National Identity\u2019, by Peter Bain and Paul Shaw. It is available via <a href=\"http://incipit.com/linkrefs.html\">incipit.com</a>.\r\n\r\nIn
    addition to what Victor (Mojo) wrote: \r\nRethink the aim of your project. What
    is gained by listing typeface names, when most of these posters were made without
    the use of typefaces? Just because Fette Fraktur is a blackletter does not make
    it similar to the styles used here. \r\nWouldn\u2019t it be more interesting to
    point out the various types/groups of letterforms, their combinations, and applications?
    You could then continue and describe the special characteristics of some of the
    most striking letter styles. Alternatively, you could pick one poster, and research
    its background (designer, year, purpose \u2026) \u2013 e.g. #11, with its Faux-Hebrew."

  body: "Hello Florian Hardwig. Thank your for your great answer. Actually, this is
    for an academic briefing, which asks for a Typographic Catalogue - presenting
    some typefaces regarding a specific subject. This is for the Graphic Design course,
    and I choose to do something related to the Propaganda in the Nazi Era, because
    I've seen lots of posters and stamps with incredible type. Now I realize that
    most of them are lettering instead of typefaces. Would you suggest me a theme
    similar to this one that I can work easily with?\r\n\r\nFor example there are
    people doing a Typographic Catalogue about Movie Posters, others from TV commercials,
    etc.\r\n\r\nThank you a lot once again for your reply. It really helped me. ;)"

  body: "Creating a catalog of typefaces used in this particular context is counter
    to what the lettering is--as they aren't typefaces. \r\n\r\nI'd rethink the topic
    and maybe consider aiming more for an industry sector rather than a political
    time period. Think of industries that tend to have a particular typographic style
    (technology, fashion, travel, etc.)"

    not (so much) on posters. You could, for example, identify and research the typefaces
