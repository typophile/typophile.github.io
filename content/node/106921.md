    on historical type, so I can only say that some digital version of Bookman is
    probably as close as you can get to the original. I am curious, as well, if someone
    can exactly identify the typeface used for printing this book.\r\n\r\nPS: I was
    not meaning to be smart-assy about the typing errors in the title and the city
    of publication\u2014sorry if this came across badly. I just saw that you took
    the trouble to correct the name of the publisher, so I thought you might want
    to know about two more typos you missed. No offence meant!"

  body: "Low contrast old-style that could be roughly approximated by Bookman or Bookmania,
    and possibly Fleischman.\r\n\r\nCarl Gustav Naumann ran a family printing business
    in Leipzig. In 1901, he published Schriftproben der Firma C.G. Naumann. Sample
    pages of that book are shown in the link  http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-51969.html
    \ Unfortunately the excerpts do not show the firm's book types -- which would
    probably still have included the font used in  \u2018Jenseits von Gut und B\xF6se\u2019
    \ It may be obtainable under inter-library loan.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach
    is to consider the probability that in 1886 a Leipzig publisher like C.G. Naumann
    would have obtained its type mainly from Leipzig foundries. Leipzig foundries
    include Schelter&Giesecke and Ludwig Wagner, and Julius Klinkhardt. If you can
    find any of their old specimen books you might find a match for your font. Some
    other names that may have been Leipzig foundries -- not necessarily in the 1880s
    -- C. P. Melzer, C. R\xFCger, B.C. Breitkopf, Heinrich Hoffmeister, W. Drugulin,
    Erhardtische Schriftgie\xDFerei.\r\n\r\nFor an extensive survey of German types
