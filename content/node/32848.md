  body: "Bert's right. Sometimes they make some of their fonts available in card-making
    kits, but I don't think they use their new fonts for those kits. My <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html\">Script
    Font ID Guide</a> shows samples of most of the available Hallmark fonts. Most
    are included in Parts 7, 8 and 9 of the Guide, in the later pages of those sections
    (most samples are courtesy of typophiles Mike F. and Paul Hunt).\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Stuart Sandler's <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg13.html\">Secret
    Recipe</a>, from his Font Diner site is a pretty similar style. You could also
    look through the fonts done by <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Leuschke\">Rob
    Leuschke</a> who used to design fonts for Hallmark.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
