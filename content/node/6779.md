  body: Ow! My eyes! <BR> <BR>This is an old face that used to be carried by Letraset
    called <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/pretorian-dt/" target="_blank">Pretorian</a>.
    I&#39;m guessing they blew their whole budget on the font and didn&#39;t have
    any money left to hire a designer.

  body: Since this DTP Types, &#34;started in 1989&#34;, surely doesn&#39;t own <BR>the
    rights to this old typeface, I thought I&#39;d mention two other, <BR>reasonably
    priced sources. <BR> <BR>The Solotype Catalog shows this typeface under the name
    <BR>Pretoria &#40;no n on the end&#41;. Brendel Informatik digitized it by <BR>that
    name and offers it via the <a href="http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm" target="_blank">
    Quick Brown Fox</a> website. <BR> <BR>Dieter Steffmann digitized it as <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/v/vivian.htm"
