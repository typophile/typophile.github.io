  the author, Andy Andrews.  If you look at the image below, notice the \"the\" in
  the title.  I'm looking for something with similar flare, if you will.  Appreciate
  any help.  Thanks!! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/160_5082.jpg]"

    I was going to recommend Oneleigh :-)\r\n\r\nBTW, although the original Oneleigh
    only has a few swash caps (after Baskerville) for Oneleigh OT I completed the
    alphabet.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/\">Scotch
    Modern</a> has an interesting \"all swash caps\" effect: you can see it in the
    MyFonts type tester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
