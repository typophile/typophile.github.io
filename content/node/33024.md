  body: "This isn't an old Letraset font, it is even older ;-)\r\nThis is Prisma,
    from Rudolf Koch / Gebr. Klingspor. Prisma is an inline, all-caps version of Kabel.
    There isn't an official digital version, but there are free fonts around the internet
    somewhere."

    year. In the meantime, if you don't mind going '70s, there's Rian Hughes' <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=DET0000260">Dazzle</a>.
