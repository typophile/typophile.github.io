body: " Yesterday I was strolling at a local summer festival with hundreds of vendors
  in their booths. I couldn't help observing graphics and pointing out many instances
  of the dreaded (to us) Comic Sans and Papyrus fonts (especially the latter) on logos
  and business cards, banners, adverts, etc. \r\n\r\nI spotted an advert with BOTH!
  - a first for me. I know y'all will appreciate this. Here it is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comicsans-papyrus-8i_6036.JPG]\r\n\r\nMy
  husband has limited tolerance for my diatribes about unbearably overused fonts and
  says: \"So what? As long as it looks nice.\" etc. \r\n\r\nThat troubles me because
  it is fundamental to my identity as an artist to value creativity and originality
  over banality and mimicry. \r\n\r\nIt got me thinking that many people don't recognized
  \"overused\" as a pointed criticism. \r\n\r\nTo them, if something is used a lot,
  that means it's popular.  Popular = good = accepted standards = something I should
  do too = a feeling of belonging.  \r\n\r\nThat explains the blank looks I often
  get when pointing out that something, anything, is unbearably overused."

  body: "Overused is not a valid criticism, it\u2019s a pretentious criticism leveled
    by people who like to think that their less popular preferences are better just
    for being less popular. If we applied that criticism to music most of what\u2019s
    ever been written would be of no value because so much of it is built on the same
    simple foundations. Designers who gripe about typefaces being overused need to
    realize that they sound just like indie music fans who can\u2019t shut up about
    how they liked a band <em>before</em> they were cool.\r\n\r\nPoorly used, however,
    is a valid criticism. And this is an excellent example of how two fonts can be
    very poorly used. Neither is appropriate for this kind of signage, nor have they
    been typeset well. The images are uninspired, the color palette thoughtless, and
    the layout appears to be recycled from a bad take-out menu. And it\u2019s probably
    an inkjet print that will fade quickly and look like hell when it does. That\u2019s
    why this sign is so much worse that the myriad good signs in Helvetica that we
    don\u2019t gripe about so much, not matter overused Helvetica is."

  body: "James you are right, but when I say \"overused\" it also implies poorly used,
    since countless amateurs do their own graphics now. \r\n\r\nOveruse of Helvetica
    is not as annoying (to me) because it's not a \"novelty\" font and fits in quietly,
    without crying \"Why am I here? I don't belong here!\" \r\n\r\nI saw one business
    card recently which used Papyrus appropriately for the subject, and looked rather
    elegant. But I still winced at the sight. Considering there are hundreds of suitable
    fonts NOT done to death. \r\n\r\nI realize that inexpertise is fine with the majority.
    Most people do have a specialty or area of expertise in which they instantly recognize
    and disapprove of hack work, while most others are oblivious. \r\n\r\nThanks to
    my lurking on this site and others, I now recognize typographical hack work; at
    one time I wouldn't have noticed. "

    businesses that do all their own work. I am sure the fonts fall into the \"what-we-have-on-our-computer\"
    set. The street vendor is just trying to make a buck on the cheap. \r\nActually,
    work this naive has a charm I can forgive from a mom&pop shop. I am not saying
    it is good design but that it is not criminal looking as it might be if it were
    done by a larger corporation with more budget and experience that should know
    better.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me of tiny family businesses across the land and it
    makes me smile. It brings back memories of my uncle Gus's homemade candy store
    and his self-made posters--badly hand painted signs but the hand dipped chocolates
    were to die for :-)\r\n\r\nYasou, Uncle Gus! May you rest in peace.\r\n \r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nThanks,

  body: "<em>Overused is not a valid criticism.</em>\r\n\r\nIn theory no, but in practice
    it's another matter.\r\nIf everyone uses the same materials and tools without
    much imagination (and even the best of us can't hit a home run every time we come
    to the plate), then everything starts to look the same. Working with common materials,
    people fall into ruts.\r\nBut working with little used typefaces, you're more
    likely to come up with something that looks different, not just because the typeface
    is different, but because there are less clich\xE9s to fall back on in the way
    that it's used. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Overuse is not a poor trait in and of itself, but it makes poor use much
    easier. When a typeface like Arial, Comic Sans, or Papyrus enters ubiquity because
    of its accessibility, the vast majority of its applications are poor and cheap-looking.
    Thus, those typefaces can no longer escape the connection with unprofessional
    and cheap design that they carry, and it becomes increasingly difficult to use
    them well.\r\n\r\nThe reason that other typefaces that are probably overused (most
    notably Gotham and Helvetica) escape (mostly) this same criticism is because the
    majority of their applications are professional and well-done, because they are
    not accessible to just anyone who has a computer (although Helvetica comes bundled
    with Macs, the vast majority of computer users, and especially businesses, still
    use Windows boxes).\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to see what the type community thinks
    of Calibri ten or fifteen years from now. It certainly doesn't carry the same
    baggage as Arial, and it's certainly an attractive font now, but is it going to
    be so ubiquitous and so often poorly used that it will carry the same air of unprofessionalism
    as Arial?\r\n\r\n(Sorry to divert the conversation away from specifically Comic
    Sans and Papyrus, but I think that Arial is the greatest victim of poor use through
    overuse. I've gone so far as to tell people, \"There is no application of Arial
    where something else would not be more appropriate, unless you're trying to be
    intentionally unprofessional.\" I think there are still some viable uses of Comic
    Sans and Papyrus.)"

  body: "I know this has been discussed to death here. But only recently did I realize
    that Papyrus is the only installed font that conveys \"elegance\" to the untrained
    eye. This elegant look, they believe, classes up everything: frozen yogurt, hemp
    sneakers, computer services. To their eye, it really is distinctive. \r\n\r\nAt
    business networking events, I frequently spy Papyrus-adorned cards. Like this:
    The website is very minimal, but there's the Papyrus on black: <a href=\"http://www.jabezproductions.com\"><strong>Jabez
    Productions</strong></a>\r\n\r\nSo, elegant = Papyrus. Friendly = Comic Sans.
    Official = Times Roman. Everything else = Arial. (Combining the first two: Elegant
    AND friendly??)\r\n\r\nI redesigned a website for a Bed & Breakfast with a calligraphic
    title, headers, and navbar that really were elegant in: <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/kallos-itc/><strong>Kallos</strong></a>.
    \r\nThen the owner insisted all text be in Comic Sans. I explained it clashed
    with the look of the headers. I told her \"friends don't let friends use Comic
    Sans.\" She insisted stubbornly - this was her \"signature font\". I wince when
    I view the pages, but she's very pleased\r\n\r\nFor her printed lit, I convinced
    her, after much persuasion, to let me use Maiandra for the text instead of Comic
    Sans.\r\n"
