  <BR> <BR>Hefeweizen is a sans serif font built entirely with straight lines and
  angles based on 60-degree increments. Many of the characters follow blackletter
  form, but not strictly.  <BR> <BR>It also works suprisingly well at smaller sizes,
  and can be used for short blocks of text.  <BR> <BR>It was &#40;very&#41; loosely
  inspired by Frere-Jones&#39; &#34;Pilsner&#34;, but quickly developed its own direction.  <BR>
  <BR>The character set is not yet complete, but this sample gives a good feel for
  where it&#39;s going.  <BR> <BR>As always, critique is most welcome.  <BR> <BR>David

    or is the <BR>intent to follow a more historical blackeletter <BR>pattern? <BR>
    <BR>This is very cool. I&#39;d be interested to see what  <BR>it looks like at

    follow the blackletter model, but enough alternates characters are suggesting
    themselves that I&#39;m planning an alternates set for this one as well. I&#39;ll
    take your advice to heart for the u/lc &#34;J/j&#34; and &#34;Y/y&#34;, and probably
    include them in either the main set or the alternates. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll get either
    a pdf or an eps set &amp; e-mailed to you to print out. <BR> <BR>David '

  body: ' The caps are great. I&#39;m with Stephen on the J,j and Y,y. I have a hard
    time with the g too. It needs a more open bottom bowl and an ear consistent with
    it&#39;s other angles. Also, I&#39;d pull the numbers way back; they are kind
    of bumpy. The text has a very strong vertical emphasis that is lost on the numerals.
    Almost every letter has one very bold vertical stroke going from top to bottom,
    giving it a very boxy feel. &#40;just like the original textura quadrada&#41;.
    I think you could give the numbers this same feel. For ex. the 2 could have a
    longer vertical stroke on it&#39;s back, the five could loose the angle on it&#39;s
    back, the seven could have a strong, vertical leg attached by a hairline consistent
    with other angles in the face and the 1 and 4 could loose their base serifs.  <BR>
    <BR>I know that you have avoided horizontals exepting on the bases of vertical
    strokes, but I think one would be appropriate on the crossbar of the 4. <BR> <BR>Wow.
    I hope that&#39;s not too much. I really do like the feel of the face. The E and
    the R are about the coolest things I&#39;ve seen in a while. I&#39;m interested
    to see the rest of the character set &#40;how do you do it? your faces are always
    to complete&#41;. <BR> <BR>Christian R. '
