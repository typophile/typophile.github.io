  opens the pfb file with FontLab 4.6, changes the font infos and generate again the
  font, with new afm, inf, pfb and pfm files. <BR> <BR>Since kerning data are stored
  in afm and pfm files and FontLab opens only the pfb file, I fear this process can
  lead to a loss in the original kerning infos. <BR> <BR>My colleague says FontLab
  automatically search for metric files in the same folder where the pfb files are:
  so when he generate the font FontLab use the original metric files to create the
  new afm and pfm files.  <BR> <BR>What do you think about it?'

  body: Hi John <BR>So my colleague is right? <BR>Can you tell me when FontLab acquire
    the kerning infos from the afm/pfm files placed in the same directory as the pfb
    file? When the user opens the file or when he &#40;re&#41;generate the font? <BR>
    <BR>Many thanks

  body: When you open a font in FontLab, the metrical data is read in at the same
    time -- you can check this by opening the metrics/kerning window. <BR> <BR>But
    this &#42;file&#42; isn&#39;t a font -- its extension is .vfb. You only have a
    &#42;font&#42; when you &#42;generate fonts&#42;. So I suppose you could say that
    technically, the kerning data is put in a font when it is &#40;re&#41;generated,
    but the data is read into FontLab when the file is opened. <BR> <BR>A small point.

  body: 'Alberto,  <BR> <BR>you don&#39;t need to worry. For Win Type 1 fonts, if
    you open a .pfb file, FontLab automatically looks for a corresponding .afm file
    in the same folder, and if not found, for a .pfm file. Only if none of these files
    are found in the same folder, FontLab will drop the kerning.  <BR> <BR>BTW, for
    Mac Type 1 fonts, kerning will get imported if you open the font suitcase, but
    will be dropped if you directly open the LWFN printer font file -- so you need
    to be careful which file you open.  <BR> <BR>Your trick is fine, but remember
    that some font names are written in the .afm/.inf and .pfm files, e.g. MS Menu
    Name, or Family Name. So if you modify font naming and generate a .pfb file, but
    you use the old .afm or .pfm, your font names may be out of sync. Actually, Microsoft
    Windows really reads the font names from the .pfm file, NOT from the .pfb file,
    when accessing the font. So it is always a good idea to re-make all Type 1 files:
    .pfb, .afm, .inf and .pfm.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Adam Twadoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.'

    read in a .afm file &#40;dunno about mac formats&#41;. A good check would be to
    open the metrics/kerning window  to make sure the kerning data is there. If the
    kerning data isn&#39;t there, find the .afm file and manually import it. <BR>
