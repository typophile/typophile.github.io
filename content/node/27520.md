body: "I am completing a display face and considering wheater it should have a slanted
  as italic or not. It's a typeface that more or less are kind of geometric so the
  \"italic\" _will_ be just a slanted version.\r\n\r\nI can imagine that it's very
  easy for the user of the font just to slant it in InDesign or such (since it will
  produce the same effect) and therefore I am considering not to produce the oblique
  version and leave that to the user.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, many fonts have
  this as a version in the family, so maybe it's a good idea anyway. \r\n\r\nWhat
  are you thoughts on this?\r\n"

  body: You definitely need to make the oblique cut. If you just slant the letters,
    the bowls get messed up.

    true. Good obliques differ in important ways from the slanted garbage that you
    get by simply obliquing the regular font. For more infor read: [[Obliques How-To]]."

  body: "I do understand that if the letters are more traditional, it's impossible
    to just slant them.\r\n\r\nMy font is built up with squares only, so there are
    no bowls that will look strange I believe. Or do you? :)\r\n\r\nPS. Sorry for
    my bad english\u2026"

  body: "I was looking at some Typodog stuff the other day, and I think what you are
    suggesting could work for a purely geometric monoline font. But you should still
    design your own \u2013 who knows what one of those brutal programs would do to
    your type."

  body: even if the font is "purely geometric" obliquing it will make it all wonky.
    Your diagonals get distorted with some getting heavier and others lighter. Take
    the time to do it right.

  body: "Just to illustrate what happens even with a simple shape composed of straight
    lines when you simply slant it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slanted_6674.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
    amount of slant here is more than you would usually use, but it makes it more
    obvious what is happening.\r\n\r\nNotice how the vertical lines of the square
    now look thinner; the two strokes of the X are not the same thickness; and both
    shapes look wider."
