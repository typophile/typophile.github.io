body: These numbers come with Risotto Script Extras, but Risotto Script is a script
  face, not handtooled serif like the numerals. Any ideas for a font that matches?
  Hard to tell in image, but the numbers have horizontal lines within the form. Thanks
  in advance![img:sites/default/files/old-images/handtooled_6719.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/handtooled_5079.jpg]
