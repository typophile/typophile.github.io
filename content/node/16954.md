body: And the 5 in Typophile 5 will have to change to 6, but 6 is a boring shape,
  how about a VI. Any thoughts

    more character.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think Stephen is right."

  body: Last year's launch of Typophile 2.0 coincided with the 5th anniversary of
    the site, and went live at approximately 5:00pm(PST) on 5 May, 2005, or 05.05.05
    at 5 -- hence the 5.

    there are 3 slices of the 5 with several fonts that are randomized. Aligning perfectly
    is not the intention."
