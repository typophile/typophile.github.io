<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>About a year ago I purchased some 14-pt. sans-serif lead type labeled "metroline." Its great stuff-- and I use it constantly. However, I'm thinking that its mislabeled. I can't find any listing anywhere for a font called "metroline"-- and the ones with similar names look NOTHING like my type. Perhaps the experts here might recognize it. A printed sample is at:
http://www.magicfishpress.com/eric/metroline.jpg
I don't know who the type founders might have been, either. No markings and no original packaging.
Good luck! Thanks for having a look!

<div class=commentbody>Mark, looks like Lightline Gothic to me as well, though there was a Monotype version of this. This difference could be determined by the body; nick and feet.
Eric, looks like you nut quadded the interword spacing here. (?)

<div class=commentbody>Is there a reference guide for identifying lead type by foundry?
Something that shows foundry marks or as Gerald mentioned how <em>This difference could be determined by the body; nick and feet</em> ?</div>

There are a number of reference sources for pinmarks but the only one that I know of online is at Briar Press
http://www.oneart.com/cgi-bin/briarpress/show.cgi?db=pin&uid=default&display=1&file=pin_marks-introduction&layout=default

In most cases, Monotype will not have a pinmark. Off hand I can only think of two Monotype operations that pinmarked their type, Baltimore Type Foundry and Phoenix Type Foundry.
And, to make it more confusing, not all firms casting foundry type (as opposed to Monotype) had pinmarks.

The second part of this has to do with nicks and feet. While there are certain general casting practices, there are far too many variables involved to use either of these as positive identification. Examples:
In many cases Monotype might have no feet, in others it may have, depending upon the type of Monotype caster. On the other hand, foundry, which often has distinct feet, as this is actually how the jet is removed, doesn't always have them either. European metal foundry that has been ground to Anglo-American type height is easily identifiable as the feet have been ground off and the grinding pattern is usually discernible. But even here, several American firms that licensed European fonts often cast them at type high with feet or made special arrangements to have them cast that way at the foreign foundry.
Metal type technology is as much of a mess in its variations as the continual evolution of digital type formats.

And Gerald-- you'll have to bear with me... I'm a (very) beginning printer. What do you mean when you say "nut quadded"?

Sorry to have lost this thread. It sort of quickly went off the charts. An old rule of thumb in traditional typography was that the width of interword spacing should be about the width of a lowercase i.
By traditional typography I am talking twentieth century. Nut quadding was a common practice of the nineteenth century as, or so the common wisdom tells it, the compositors got paid by the nut. So, of course, they nutted everything out.
The lowercase i width was concocted by the typographic revivalists as based on their perception of renaissance printing practices (which were themselves based on scribal practices). This is hardly common practice today but it does allow for a nicer setting to "the page."
Poetry should be set a bit wider but your sample is much too wide as it does not allow for easy continuous reading. Many "beginners" will do this. Last week I watched as an instructor of digital typography set his first line of metal type. He friggin quadded everything. Something about metal. . .</div>
