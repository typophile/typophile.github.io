    glyph for <code>U+00B4 ACUTE ACCENT</code> and <code>U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT</code>
    ? AFAIK that shouldn't be done because combining diacritics are supposed to have
    0 (zero) advanced width, whereas the standalone diacritics should have some advanced
    width.\r\n\r\n> <em>And what sorts of problems, if any, are you finding with implementing

    the combining accents are not being placed correctly, it suggests that either
    a) the anchors aren't placed correctly, b) the 'mark' feature is not well implemented,
    or c) both. How are you putting the 'mark' feature into your fonts?\r\n\r\nIt's
    not possible to do the 'mark' feature with the current public AFDKO, but I'm using
    an internal version that does it, and I'm getting the expected results when the
    font is used in InDesign CS3."

    anchor doesn't quite work for all accents. Some come out looking fine, some are
    a little off. For example the anchor point one one glyph works well for several
    accents, but not all, and moving the anchor for those accents creates problems
    with another glyph. So I'm wondering if it's a matter of compromise as to position
    or if I'm missing something obvious in setting the anchors. \r\n\r\n<em>AFAIK

    according to unicode how necessary is it to have the zero width combining accents
    in addition to the standalone if I'm setting anchors for placement? And if the
    zero width is necessary why do some fonts not do it, eg. Arno Pro?\r\n\r\nGeorge

    works as expected if no other font is used, though.\r\n\r\n> <em>ID ME user Harbs

    supports more languages and OT features, but it's not immune to bugs. And I've
    seen a really nasty one too, where upon applying 'smcp' or 'c2sc' to a font containing
    proper small caps (e.g. Garamond Premier Pro), the Latin small caps would come
    out correct, but the Greek and Cyrillic small caps would simply be scaled down
    caps."

    don't have to necessarily compromise. You can always add one more anchor to the
    base glyph, if that's required. But your problem might be related with the position
    of the anchor in the combining accent.\r\n\r\n> <em>And if the zero width is necessary
    why do some fonts not do it, eg. Arno Pro?</em>\r\n\r\nThat particular one is
    a known bug. But Arno has no 'mark' feature. Those combining mark characters are
    only there for the 'ccmp' feature."

    Miguel said.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that if the positioning in a particular base/mark
    combination is wrong, then anchors may not be placed ideally in either base or
    mark glyph or both. It's like with spacing letters -- the better the sidebearing
    are, the less kerning is required. (And mark positioning <em>is</em> a form of
    spacing, not only in x-direction but in x/y-direction. Think of an anchor's position
    as defining a \"sidebearing\". Also, an anchor defines not a mere x/y but a Dx/Dy,
    relative to the glyph's outlines.)"
