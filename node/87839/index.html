		<div class="commentbody">Andreas — I understand your frustration and that it seems like no one is paying attention. From what I understand, however, the IT guys at Punchcut are unable to reproduce many of the image upload issues that various users encounter. That makes it very hard to troubleshoot and fix. They have been trying.

When all else fails, you can always place an image in a post using an HTML &lt;img&gt; tag. I realize that this is inconvenient. I also realize that this may not be so easy for folks who aren’t comfortable with HTML, but I bet they’re a small minority here. For those who don’t have their own server to host images, there’s always Flickr or a similar hosting site. 

Not perfect solutions, but ways to work around these stubborn bugs.

As for the limited character support in the sIFR headlines, someone at Punchcut will have to respond about that. I don’t know what their limitations are or what guides their decisions with Featured Font sponsors about glyph subsetting.

Dust — Your issue is completely separate. You got server error messages because your ID request was flagged by Akismet as spam and was sent to a moderation queue. I can’t tell you why this happens, because I don’t really understand the Akismet algorithm. It is imperfect at best. I wish the system returned a more informative message to users, but that’s not an area under my control.

Your forum message has been cleared now and should be posted, and I’ve whitelisted your account.</div>

I reproduced the issue in both Firefox 8.0 and IE 9 on Windows7. The problem seems to be related to the size of the image. I don't know if this pertains to the pixel dimensions or the amount of data. The original jpg failed with the 500 error, but when I re-saved it, the upload worked. I tried jpg, png, gif; the image format didn't seem to matter. 

<cite>They have been trying.</cite>

Are you suggesting that they're simply incompetent?

No. I was trying to convey that the pleas have not simply been ignored.

I doubt the issue is pixel dimensions, since there are plenty of images still being uploaded by users that push the pixel size boundaries.

The default maximum file size per upload is 1 MB. I thought that was stated somewhere, but perhaps users aren’t aware. (But why would someone be uploading a >1MB file anyway?)  Do you recall how large your original file was, Carl?

I did just notice a setting in the Admin section that Drupal annotates with “The default maximum size of all files a user can have on the site.” I wonder if users who are having the upload issue are frequent posters and have surpassed this “lifetime” limit?

I don’t think that would explain all cases, but I’ll check with Rhett and the guys and see if maybe we should change that setting.

I seem to recall that there are two separate and perhaps unrelated (or maybe not) issues — one is uploading and inserting images in a comment; the other is uploading and attaching files (especially PDFs) in an initial post. I think Andreas’ latest frustration was triggered by the former, while Ben was having problems with the latter (or maybe both?).

I have always suspected that the Flash uploader might be a culprit in the current configuration, but I don’t know enough about Drupal.</div>

Sometimes graphic files can be much larger than you'd expect. Have you asked folks to send their troublesome photos to you by email? That way you could check the file size and also see if you're able to reproduce their upload problems.

(I've never had any problems posting photos here.)

<cite>Do you recall how large your original file was, Carl?</cite> 

The 'normal' sized file I tested varied depending on the file format, but all versions were less than 200KB. The above image is 102KB, and it works. I tried another jpg which is 132KB and it causes the error. I have a 117KB image that also would have uploaded. So, the magic limit seems to be 117KB > x > 132KB.

		<div class="commentbody">1MB is a reasonable limit for images. If its a web-friendly format like jpg/png/gif, 1MB would typically be too large for useful display. That said, I use a Wiki at work, which provides a really cool 'thumbnail' option. The article gets a small, re-sized image and a link is auto-generated to load the full file. That kind of scheme would be ideal for Typophile because users sometimes want to share minute details. It is a community of design wonks, after all. 

This might be an opportunity to explore different uploader options. Perhaps there's something commonly used with Drupal with similar functionality that doesn't depend on Flash.

Hot-linking, or whatever the web kids call it, is wrong because the content is not contained. Typophiles refer to old content much more often than other web communities. If a pertinent image goes missing from an archived thread, the value could be lost. It might not seem obvious if you ignore other discussion sites, but the signal-to-noise ratio is probably higher here than any other site I visit. 

I'm not even sure I'm a true Typophile--I just find John Hudson and Hrant's banter interesting.</div>

<cite>But my point is that in 2011 we should have uploading programming sophisticated enough to convert submitted filenames into workable ones rather than just failing.</cite>

Exactly.The latter issue reminds me of a statement made within Flickr's API documentation. It says something like "The Flickr API expects all data to be UTF-8 encoded" in giant letters. This is the baseline/expected behavior for the web circa 2011. A Chinese type designer should be able to name their files in Chinese. The majority of human beings do not speak English, and modern type design potentially involves all written language. So, it seems to me that Typophile should be able to handle this stuff. Again, I'm not suggesting that Punchcut is capable of creating an uploader. They just need to find/license one that works properly for their site and implement it. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think I have the solution for titles: the string sent to flash in the flashvars is currently built with <code>escape</code> which does not encode utf-8 characters the way flash is expecting them. This happens at line 561 of the file http://typophile.com/files/js/js_906ebf552a4d48f32d6b19cd75bded6f.js in the definition of the function <code>toFlashvarsString</code>. In order to change as little as possible the code, I would simply replace <code>escape</code> with <code>escape_utf8</code> at line 561 and define <code>escape_utf8</code> as follows:
<PRE>
// encodings for lower characters  returned by escape
//    that differ from those returned by encodeURI
function nkch(c)
{
  var nkc = {};
  nkc["~"]="%7E"; nkc["!"]="%21"; nkc["'"]="%27";
  nkc["("]="%28"; nkc[")"]="%29"; nkc["#"]="%23";
  nkc["$"]="%24"; nkc["&"]="%26"; nkc[","]="%2C";
  nkc[":"]="%3A"; nkc[";"]="%3B"; nkc["="]="%3D";
  nkc["?"]="%3F";                  return nkc[c];
}

// Same as escape for lower characters (from 1 to 127)
// Same as encodeURI above 127
function escape_utf8(s)
{
  rexp=/~|!|'|\(|\)|#|\$|&|,|:|;|=|\?/g ;
  return encodeURI(s).replace(rexp, nkch);
}
</PRE>
The behaviour should stay unchanged on characters from 1 to 127.

Yes, your announcement did get sent to the spam moderation queue. I don’t know why the spam engine picks some legitimate posts from some established users to flag. 

Your latest Build thread has been approved, and I’ve whitelisted your account now so hopefully you won’t encounter this problem in the future.

I’ll talk to the Punchcut IT guys, but they may not have easy access to setting the messages when Akismet flags spam.</div>

This is the one Christian Dior uses (slightly changed, made the ‘h’ higher) as logo typeface, isn’t it?
It’s a case that I have on my desktop a picture of an old perfume bottle (it’s in the Dior book, Collection Rolf Heyne) and I see the character almost identic.
Very nice!
Did you make a digital version of it?

For uploading pictures I use often GIFs that are smaller and permit greater picture measures.
