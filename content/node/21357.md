    feel.\r\nWhen you do \"sixties\" style while \"straight\" it just looks like boring
    \"seventies\" stuff ;-)"

  body: "This lettering pales in comparison to what those poster artists were doing
    back then. The rave scene also had some pretty unique lettering.\r\n\r\nI wonder
    what those two things had in common?\r\n\r\nIt was a different \"state\" of mind
    like Norbert said. Fun while it lasted, which was about 8 hours or so if I remember
    correctly. :)\r\n\r\npeace"
