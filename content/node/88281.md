  body: "First, this is hardly \u2018fonts\u2019 at all, perhaps not even type. Much
    more likely this is *lettering* on a lithography.\r\nSo its only natural that
    you won\u2019t find these particular \u201Cfonts\u201D anywhere. \r\n\r\nHowever,
    it will take you only seconds to find [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/baselinefonts/dusty-circus/|fonts
    like this]] and then you may use the \u201Cmore fonts like this\u201D function
    to the right to find even more of the kind. Good luck!"

    font and then the \"witness inspirating vows font\" and the 12th (love how the
    bar on the T is curved and the bar in the H is raised). \r\nThank you all!"

    and then the \"Historical Marysville...\" (same font as \"unlike any other\".
    \r\n\r\nI think you're right on the th. I looked at that font, but totally missed
    the rounded topped T. Apparently I've been looking for way too long. \r\nWhen
    I looked at CrashNumberingSerif, the 2 isn't quite the same as what I'm looking
    for (though it is the 4 in my previous image). I've found a few close ones, but
    none with the exact 2. \r\n\r\nI can't get the image inserted, so here is a photobucket
