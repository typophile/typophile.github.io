  here!]]\r\n\r\nCandelivers is a fun and display typeface, for better use in short
  sentences, or letterings and logo designs. It comes with a several features, like
  swashes, alternates and ligatures. It has a little not simmetry between the characters
  that gives a personality and handmade touch. \r\nAlso it comes with a Glow version,
  to give more soft and fun personality. I hope you enjoy it!"
