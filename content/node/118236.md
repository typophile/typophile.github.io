  I bumped into Sassoon Primary. I downloaded it from ufonts.com, it says it's free.\r\n\r\nIs
  this website reliable? I need to know because it'll be troublesome to get into legal
  issues later!\r\n\r\nThanks! :)"

  body: '<a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?3XD">Sassoon Primary</a> was done
    by Rosemary Sassoon and Adrian Williams and is a commercial font. No freefont.
    Please purchase it via one of the vendors in the link. Your above mentioned site
    is in no way reliable. Better go to fontsquirrel.com for quite reliable free fonts. '

    or AbstractFonts.com.
