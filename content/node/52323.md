body: "Well guys, as i am going to post a personal blog link here so this might sound
  like a little shameless self promotion but i couldn't resist myself to share this
  with you. \r\n\r\nWe all know smilies ..right ? :) \r\nSomehow they are also a great
  expression of typography, but we have only seen them in web-based fonts like verdana,
  georgia etc...\r\n\r\nSo i just did a small experiment to see how other typefaces
  smile.\r\nHere is a link to my related blog-post... please have a look.\r\n\r\nhttp://designjunction.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/smiling-typefaces/
  \r\n\r\nYou might like it."
