    angle.\r\nSee this movie: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ga3u9XvCLJc\r\n\r\nWhen I
    was in a calligraphy workshop I simply made all the strokes from the end to the
    beginning, for example the i from the bottom to the top.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"

    calligraphy.\r\n\r\nNever tried it myself, though."

    is basically simple black lettering. The only difference to me was not resting
    my hand on the page. '

    left-handed calligrapher.

  body: "Wow. I'm left-handed and my attempts at calligraphy were always pretty atrocious,
    even with the oblique nib.  Seems like John DeCollibus in that video has an extra
    attachment to hold the nib at a different angle, as well as the rotated page.
    Oh, and ability, too. LOL.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nEver
