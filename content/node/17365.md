  new I won't rehash that.\r\n\r\nThis is for my friends non-profit disc golf organization.
  The org puts on tournaments, sponsors events and produceds a small amount of wearable
  gear for the disc golf market.\r\n\r\nThe target market stretches from 16 to 50(tenatively),
  so it's not so slanted toward one end of the consumeristic spectrum or the other.
  I will write more blah, blah, blah if I don't stop now.\r\n\r\nLet the judges critique.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I like the Meta version, it's more "playful." I do think the words could use
    some seperation.

  body: "For the 'core' versions, I prefer Interstate, but for the full name ones,
    I prefer Meta.\r\n\r\nHave you considered making the disc off-center to the right,
    to imply flight/motion? Perhaps on the horizontal versions, the disc could sit
    where a superscript would for the word 'core', to show some flight and motion?
    The layouts feel a bit too static for the subject. The disc shows spin, but not
    as much flight."

  body: "I agree with Chris on everything he said. Also consider moving the disc far
    away from the mark and look at different sizes of the disc itself.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,
    disc golf is awesome."

  body: "So I finally got to updating based on some of the ideas. Chris, I know what
    you mean completely. It does feel static, though it should have motion since it
    is a quick/fast sport. I hope some of the examples give it what you think it needs.\r\n\r\nI
    definitely avoided using any extra elements to imply motion. It would  distract
    immediately from the disc form if I did.\r\n\r\nAre the new samples better in
    your mind? I kind of dig the top row, second in from the left.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yeah, after staring at the new ones for 5min, I agree with your selection.  Top
    row, third from the right.  Nice work, Mate.
