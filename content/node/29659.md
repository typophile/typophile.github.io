  but wihout luck.\r\n\r\nI 'm looking for a website that I have been to before. Here
  a vague description: It looks sort of dark grey and not conservative at all. Fonts
  are offered for sale right through the website. Typefaces are listed in categories
  'serif', 'sans (serif)' and two or three others. There were one or more  sans serif
  fonts on there (single styles only) for $99. One of them was quite chunky with slightly
  rounded corners.\r\n\r\nSorry to be so vague, but I'm sure someone here can point
  me into the right direction."
