  gray, but if it is, please let me know and I will delete this thread. In any case,
  I have a logo design project and I have a feeling that Forza might work well for
  part of the logotype. Would somebody be willing to type out the word \"RETRO\xB7QUAKE\"
  (and if you have time, with varying caps styles like Retro\xB7Quake and retro\xB7quake).
  EPS outlines or even semi-hires JPEG/PNGs would be incredibly helpful! If it works
  in this setting, I will be purchasing a license for it.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nBrendan"

    click \"test drive\" to try the font. If you want to try it in a layout, take
    a screen shot of the result. This should be enough to decide whether you want
    to buy the license. Someone else can feel free to correct me, but I do think that
    asking someone else to typeset something for you in a face you don't have is,
    at the very least, \"ethically grey,\" even if it's just for a mockup. But a screenshot
    of the trial on the H&FJ site should work for this purpose."

  body: In any other situation, I would be more than happy with a site's font preview
    (MyFonts' implementation is exceptional, and House Industries allows for enabling
    ligatures and alternate characters). However, H&FJ has one of the most restrictive
    and featureless font previews I have used. If I am going to plunk down $200 for
    a seat of Forza, I better know pretty well whether or not it is going to work
    perfectly. At any rate, if this is the best I can get, then I guess I'll try to
    work with it.

  body: "Just as a sidenote: I feel that some people here are a little bit too much
    on the procedurial side. I do not own Forza myself (I seriously use Eurostile
    instead...), but if I did, I would send him his word right away, as a kind gesture;
    I really don't see where is the problem. He's not stealing the type (though he
    could), he just wants to check it in a good way but doesnt want to put 200 bucks
    away with a little risk, and I totally understand that.\r\n\r\nAnd about asking
    H+FJ for a favor, forget about it. Last year I asked them for a photo and some
    sketches of Gotham for my (then) upcoming book (that is still the bestselling
    typo book in France btw), and I am still waiting for an answer. They are insanely
    great type designers, though, among the best. But when it comes to \"thanksgiving
    spirit spreading\"...\r\n\r\nd."

    kentlew's distinction between raster and vector images. In light of this, I stand
    corrected; however, I unfortunately don't own Forza, so can't help you out. Best

    these days, so any constructive thoughts you have would be very welcome. In the

    I'd hope that the existing TestDriver we have will help you out. Thanks for considering
    Forza for your project.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ"
