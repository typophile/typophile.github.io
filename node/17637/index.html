  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">  Hi everyone,

  I am hoping to get some business cards printed for my first job (non-profit). And when I went to a printers web site I saw their requirments for printing, and I'm a little lost. 

  They ask that the file be PDF, and have bleed and trim marks. I know how to do all that, but I am lost as to how you set it up for a printer. For example, how big do I make the page inorder for them to see the bleed? So if my bleed is 3mm, and my card is 90mm x 55mm, then does that mean I make the page 93mm x 58mm? IS that how it works? And I assume the trim line is just be a box marking the trim with a .25pt line thickness.

Sorry if these questions are really stupid and sound very noobie, but I want to get it right.

Thank You</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It is probably best to use InDesign, where you can set the document size (trim), margins (live area) and bleed in the "Document Setup." CS 2 will also allow you to export a press-ready PDF/X-1A with the appropriate color profile embedded.

But whichever app you set-up your file in, do not put a box around your trim. It will be extremely difficult for your printer to cut directly on a .25pt line – that's what a bleed is for – an area for the printer to safely cut within.

There is a great deal to know about making files press-ready. <a href="http://www.sappi.com/NR/rdonlyres/58071E52-0EB0-4F34-886F-6CB1CC85FE0F/0/TheStandard1_Prepress.pdf">The Standard</a>, which is published by Sappi, is a great place to start. Sappi also has more advanced informational brochures available <a href="http://www.sappi.com/SappiWeb/Knowledge%20bank/Technical%20brochures/">here</a>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In InDesign CS2, clicking "More Options" in the Document Setup screen will show you a specific option for Bleed size. This is useful because if you export a PDF and check "Crop Marks" and other printer's marks, ID will automatically add proper marks for that document size and leave the bleeded color/images.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You can setup a bleed area in Illustrator as well. I have a default PDF export setting which works in Indy and Illy which I use to include crop, trim and bleed marks. I'd also suggest once you create your PDF to test print the separations to a laser printer to make sure your colors separate correctly and that extra plates don't output.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just to note that 'page size' in the context you use it doesn't matter; the printers will arrange many copies of your artwork on whatever size sheet their press uses ("imposition") and then cut down to the finished size using the cropmarks.

For a regular, rectangular piece, make the page size the same as your finished item.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is my process:

I've found that different print shops do different things. Some will print 2-up, some 4-up and some more depending on the situation. If I don't know the exact setup, I almost always set my Illustrator artboard to 11" x 8 1/2" and let the printer set up the artwork for the press (assuming the printer is well established and knows its stuff).

Then I create a rectangle 3 1/2" x 2" (for a standard card) with no fill and a 0.25pt stroke in black. I'll be deleting this outline before I send it to the printer, but for now I use it as a guide of the card edges.

Then I copy this rectangle and expand its dimensions by 1/4" (or 1/8" on each side). I remove the stroke on this rectangle and give it a light grey fill. I'll be deleting this rectangle as well, but for now I use it as a guide of the bleed. Keep in mind, if you aren't printing a bleed, you can skip this step.

To create the trim marks, I select the original 3 1/2" x 2" rectangle and go Filter > Create > Crop Marks. This will produce you trim marks in a registration colour (so that it will print on all plates). I usually add registration marks (targets) as well, but most printers can add this for you.

Now, using the guides described above, I layout the front of my card. Then, I repeat the steps for the back of the card and set the 2 side-bide side (with some breathing room) on my 11" x 8 1/2" artboard.

As a final step, I remove the 2 guide rectangles so that all I'm left with is my artwork and the trim marks. Also, I always use the Document Info window in Illustrator to do a final check on the artwork before producing a PDF and test print.

Hope that helps.
