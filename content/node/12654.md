body: I am curious to know if there are any Winnipeg typophiles on these forums. Or
  am I the only one? If you don't know what or where Winnipeg is, then you're definitely
  not one!

  body: Hey! My 2 best friends are from Winnipeg. They just make fun of me for my
    type obsessions, however. But I'll ask them if know of any type-afflicted folks
    up in the desolate prairie lands of the Great White North.

    Winnipeg. Unless ... Nick S or John H, aren''t you guys in Canada? Any chance
    either of you have any colleagues in town? '

  body: Hi. It's funny you asked. I live in Brooklyn but we're moving to Winnipeg
    in the summer. I'm definitely looking to meet up with like-minded type/design
    folks. Where do you live in Winnipeg?

  body: "You know what -- my friend Zena's father is the Dean of the art department
    at the University of Manitoba in Winter-peg. She said she'd ask him if he knew
    of anyone there who specialized in type. Though it'll be a while. He just got
    hitched for the 5th time, so he's in Gay Paree now. You crazy Canadians ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the Zab Hobart mention, Nick. I'll have to look her work up next time I head
    up to the Land of Black Flies the Size of Dogs."

  body: "Thanks for talking to your friend, Nathan. It would be great if this query
    turns up anything. But black flies? Who told you that? They're called \"mosquitoes,\"
    but they are in fact the size of dogs ...\r\n\r\nNick, thanks for the tip about
    Zab. I can't find much about her online except that she is a graphic designer
    and an ATypI member. Does she have a studio here?\r\n\r\nAndrew, are you moving
    indefintely, or just for awhile? It is actually not bad here in the summer, but
    <strong>watch out</strong> for the winters! I actually live in Osborne Village
    now but will be moving closer to the University of Winnipeg mid summer, mainly
    because of the cold. (20 minute walks are nice in summer, but not in -30 windchills).
    Send me an email when you're going to be moving. It'll be nice to know someone
    else into type here in town.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Nothing like better late than never. I've successfully relocated to Winnipeg,
    two years ago, from Brooklyn. It's good to be here; design and typography, specifically,
    are somewhat alive and relatively well here. Nepenthe, send me an email if you're
    still here. It would be nice to meet up.
