  my font here.\r\nIt's my first some kind of Sans-Serif-Display-OpenType font, based
  on circles and rectangulars and other shapes. Most drawn with FontCreator (my previous
  font maker program).\r\n\_\r\nHere's an (older) image, which I made with Illustrator
  at school:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/geometro_4120.PNG]\r\n\r\n
  \r\nI've made a little test specimen, which I added in my attachment. Not all glyphs
  are listed, but it contains Latin, wide range of accented letters, Greek, Cyrillic,
  Small Caps and more.\r\nI think I need to get InDesign somewhere and learn how to
  use, because PowerPoint (2007) can't access my OpenType glyphs and alternates, etc.\r\n\r\nPlease
  note:\r\n- I'm 15 years old, so big way to go and enhance.\r\n- Never had any lessons
  on type designing.\r\n- My first \"meeting\" with FontLab Studio.\r\n- My first
  OpenType project.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your replies!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn

    age. For a first attempt this looks really nice, and certainly very complete!
    \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of points I'd like to address, but they all seem to
    have the same origin; you following your grid very strictly (something I do too
    sometimes). But as you said you purposly based this design on geometrical forms,
    so I guess they are not really <em>flaws</em>. And all I will suggest to take
    a good look at how a font like Century Gothic (also based on geometrical shapes)
    sometimes breaks the grid a little to make sure there is not too much negative
    space between the glyphs, ensuring everything fits together a bit better.\r\n\r\nSucces
    ermee!"

  body: "Hi Martijn,\r\n\r\nI agree with Wouter above me, nice that you're exploring
    type design at your age. How did you get interested in it? Anything in particular?\r\n\r\nI
    also think that you should 'let go of the grid' in certain situations. I understand
    that geometry is the basis of your design, but ultimately it all comes down to
    how it <em>looks optically</em>. You'll see that well known geometric typefaces,
    like Avant Garde or Futura aren't actually completely geometric. \r\n\r\nFor example,
    the strokes of the bowls in those typefaces taper when they meet the stem (where
    the rounds meet the straights the lines get thinner), to make sure that no 'black
    blobs' appear. That's one of many details you can use to make sure everything
    looks balanced.\r\n\r\nAnother thing you should probably take a look at are the
    dimensions of certain characters; some of them are very wide, while others are
    too narrow. This is probably also something that you can solve by letting go of
    the grid. For example:\r\n\r\nlowercase:\r\n- The f is too wide on the top\r\n-
    The h is quite wide (so the m, n and u as well)\r\n- The ear of the r is also
    very wide\r\n- The s is too narrow, and the spine (the middle part) could be a
    bit more smooth\r\n- The t is too wide\r\n- The v, w and z are probably also slightly
    too wide\r\n\r\nuppercase:\r\n- The top bowl of the B should be slightly narrower,
    so that they are optically equal. As you can see now, the top bowl looks larger
    than the bottom one, eventhough they are the same size.\r\n- A, H, M, U, W, X,
    Y, Z are too narrow\r\n- L is too wide\r\n- S spine again could be a bit more
    smooth\r\n\r\nnumbers:\r\n- 3 top should be smaller, it now looks larger eventhough
    it isn't\r\n- 4 the crossbar (horizontal) should probably come down\r\n- 5 the
    bottom part should be larger / top is too high\r\n- 8 same as 3, top probably
    too large, make them optically the same\r\n\r\nI would just take a look at Futura,
    and the dimensions of its characters in relation to each other. Not to copy them,
    but to learn from.\r\n\r\nVeel succes! :)"

  body: "Quincunx: I will improve most of the things you mentioned, but those ears
    of the \"r\" and the \"f\" i.e., I think they give some unique style to Geometro.
    But to not dissatisfy you, I will include alternates of them. Maybe I'll put those
    f's and r's with big ears in a alternate, perhaps that give it a more accesible
    sans look. :)\r\n\r\nDanGayle: Thanks for your reply, and you don't have to wait
    that long, because in the Netherlands you are allowed to drink beer from 16 years
    old. ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe font is of course not finished. I already discovered some
    missing glyphs (accented \"y\"'s and \"w\"'s) and some artifacts in some glyphs.
    I will do my best to make a nice, for me first, professional font. :)\r\n\r\nKind

  body: "I'm confused about the cedillas. I was sure that most of them (all but \xC7\xE7\u015E\u015F)
    were supposed to be comma-accents instead. That's how they're described in Fontlab.
    But I opened up the character map and took a look at some system fonts and sure
    enough they all had them as cedillas. Is there a consensus on this?"

  body: I finally had the sense to check the <A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0100.pdf">Unicode
    pages</A>. G, K, L, N, R all have cedillas; I'm going to have to correct this
    in my own fonts. Since so many people use Fontlab, I wonder how often this happens.
    For S and T, <em>both</em> exist; make sure they're in the right codepoints. Though
    I get the impression that Romanians always use the cedilla codepoints and expect
    to see commas there anyway. Such are the trials of we, the obsessive-compulsive...
