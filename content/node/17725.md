  body: '"Old Friends" uses what looks to be a stenciled version of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.120906.0.5&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SIMON%26GARFUNKEL&sampleSize=29">Helvetica</a>.
    Could be hand made. I don''t know of a digital version. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=UR.109742.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SIMON%26GARFUNKEL&sampleSize=29">Cargo</a>
    is similar.'

    is clearly hand made. Note the differences in the 'N's. You might like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=CU.120753.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=WEDNESDAY&sampleSize=48">Roadworks</a>
