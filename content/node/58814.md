  Anyway, I'm getting married in September, so of course I've been a busy bee getting
  the wedding invites and whatnot all sorted out. One thing I'm still stuck on is
  the monogram I've done up...I can't get it to feel right/balanced the way I want
  it to. I'm using Gotham Light paired with Aphrodite Pro for the script portion,
  and have based my sketches on Aphrodite as a starting point. I'd appreciate some
  honest critique from those who know much more than I. It's just very hard to get
  some distance on a project so close to home, y'know? :D I'm especially concerned
  with the balance of positive/negative space and line weights. Please help, Typophiles!\r\n-Alex"

  body: 'Nice work! But since you''re looking for a critique... the tension that I
    sense in your monogram is the the angles of the characters: the H and the A are
    italicized (with the A tilted more), but the ampersand appears roman.'
