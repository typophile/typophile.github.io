  on the following record sleeves...all 3 fonts look a bit Art Deco/Nouveau to me:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.blackheart.com/store/images/badrep_cd_cover.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.blackheart.com/store/images/coverilove.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.blackheart.com/store/images/glorious.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks

    be something like Bauhaus, but I'm not sure"

  body: "Cover 1 (Bad Reputation):\r\n\r\nI don't think \"Joan Jett\" is Kabel - the
    'a' is wrong. I'm guessing it's Avant Garde Extra Light with the alternate 'e'.
    I can barely see \"BAD REPUTATION\" but it's consistent with Helvetica Bold.\r\n\r\nCover
    2 (I Love Rock-n-Roll):\r\n\r\n\"JOAN JETT & the blackhearts\" looks like Wexford,
    which is available as <a href=\"http://www.haroldsfonts.com/wexley.html\" target=\"_blank\">Wexley</a>.
    \"I Love Rock-n-Roll\" is hand-drawn.\r\n\r\nCover 3 (Glorious Results...):\r\n\r\n\"Joan
    Jett...\" shows up as Spectrum in my old Letraset catalog. It can be found digitally
    as <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/martinwait/new-spectra/\" target=\"_blank\">New
    Spectra</a> but without some of the alternates used in your sample. The hand-drawn
    looking font might be harder to track down.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
