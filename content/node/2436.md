body: Hello all. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
  BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Can anyone help me identify the typeface Burton Snowboards uses
  in their logo? It&#39;s a relativley simple sans, but the &#34;n&#34; is a bit unique
  in that it doesn&#39;t have a &#34;tail&#34; &#40;sorry, not sure of the correct
  term&#41; on it&#39;s left side. It&#39;s effectivley an upside-down &#34;u&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: The R looks a lot like TF Alambic &#40;Treacyfaces&#41;. Sample from site
    test drive.  The N could easily be a flipped U. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22526.jpg"
