  the back of our jerseys. the uniform company that did the initial printing will
  only give us an alpha-numeric code for the font. i have been yet unable to track
  down the font. we are trying to get more uniforms printed locally, so we need help
  urgently!!\r\n\r\nthank you in advance!\r\nslim skatie"
