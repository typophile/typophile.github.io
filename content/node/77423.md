  the whole basic character set. I'm not happy with the ampersand, but otherwise it
  looks ok. Next I'll use many, many days making kerning pairs.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grumpy2_6091.png]\r\nWhat
  do you think?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Adam. I've done some 1 700 kerning pairs now, with some upper-lower
    case pairs still missing. I've gone very eighties-mode; I do the kerning TNT (that's
    Tight, Not Touching), very popular in that time. After that I'll make an extreme
    hairline version.\r\nLet's see how it turns out."

  body: "All individual glyphs look really nice but some pairs look just look wrong
    to my eyes. You might want to reconsider:\r\n/e/t/c/ followed by a letter with
    a bottom serif like. In the picture this occurs in thousand (th), still (ti),
    character (ch + er)\r\n\r\nI'm no pro though, so take it with a grain of salt."

  body: Thanks, Jasper. That sample you were looking at had no kerning pairs yet (I
    think I just did some adjusting in the PhotoShop). I was yet to start those kerning
    pairs. Salt.
