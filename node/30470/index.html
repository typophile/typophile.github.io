For sure, I believe the Europeans* have a superiority complex when it comes to mobile phones and the efforts of US manufacturers. I can't say I blame them, but I think the balance of power is shifting, even if the market in the US is still a few years behind the rest of the world.

<div class=commentbody>Yup I'm biased.
I have a long Apple history in reverse order.
-Mac SE (gave c. 1991 Mac SE to Sii as a museum piece, price was $3,999 + tax, 1 mb RAM, 20 mb hard drive)
-Powerbook Wallstreet. (life release May 04 1998 and discontinued in September 01 1998, woohoo 4 months then obsolete, what an idea) It had no-floppy, custom SCSI port, CD read-only, no USB...Only way to copy files was via phone line or PCMCIA card slot.
-first Apple I-pod. grey but works.
-first Apple Photo-I-pod. scratched screen on first use.
-12'' G4 laptop (out of date again in less than a year since it can't run Aperture. Way to go, keep churning out hardware products that expire in 3 months time and add to the silicon pile.)
Can't wait for the I-pod Shower sounds like a good idea to promote wasting precious water. </div>

I don’t get this (quite usual) way of thinking. How does the release of Aperture make your computer worse? It still can do exactly the same stuff it did when you bought it. I guess you’ve had some bad luck with timing, I’m still satisfied with a Imac from 2004 and an other one from 2006. If only I could play those old black and white games somehow… Anybody got an old mac with Airborne! ?

Hopefully Apple's iPhone will raise the bar on style and performance in the mobile market! </div>

<div class=commentbody>The <a href=http://www.idlemode.com>Idlemode</a> article isn't really saying anything new. It's well known that if you control both the software and hardware from the beginning you'll create a far superior user experience. This has been apparent in Apple's computers for years, and now Microsoft is realizing it (with the Xbox360 and it's user interface.)
It might also create a drive for stronger collaborative efforts between companies; mixed-branding a single product. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Sii, yeah, it's too early to call it a home run, but there's no question this will up the ante for every other carrier and handset maker in the user experience area.
Asvetic, yes, it's true in the desktop PC world, but that is very rarely the case in the mobile/wireless industry... Handset manufacturers have no choice but to develop their UI to a carrier's specs. What is very different here is that Apple is the only manufacturer on a tier 1 US carrier that has no evidence of a Cingular UI. Not even Sony Ericsson (IMO, they have the coolest handsets available in the US) can say that.
One of the most exciting moment during the keynote was seeing the NYTimes in a browser on the phone and realizing the fonts were in Georgia. That's a breakthrough -- seeing web content on a mobile device without dumbing it down. (Of course, Cingular is on EDGE, not 3G, so you'll have to wait for it longer.)
The other great moment was seeing the pinch feature (using multi-touch) -- move two fingers to stretch or shrink an image. Pure genius.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Joe - Great rebuttal. It's not unheard of to create a non-carrier specific UI however. For example the Samsung D900: <a href=http://reviews.cnet.com/Samsung_SGH_D900_Black_carbon/4505-6454_7-32135435.html>Black Carbon</a>
Though this mobile phone is an unlocked international model, and the Apple iPhone has a specific contract with Cingular, it's still possible to create enriched User Interfaces if you have sole control of both aspects.
I also agree with the "pinch feature" and will expect Apple to fit that into more of their products in the future. I could see it in an iMac as an advanced touchscreen interface coupled with a keyboard and mouse. Or a yet to be disclosed Tablet Mac.

<div class=commentbody>I must say, I don't enjoy Helvetica when I see it — most times — because it's application is often so distasteful. I agree with the linked article above that the type on the GUI is very nice, but I haven't even heard anyone on the real eye-catcher of all graphics.

<div class=commentbody>I love love Helvetica too, but I do realize that its not the best choice for interface design. Tight apertures and not so generous counters. But as already pointed out this version of Neue Helvetica is probably modified for serious interface work.
Apple has already modded Myriad- if you go to the Apple store, check out any workstation, take a peek in FontBook, there is a special version Myriad called MyriadApple.
I like Lucida too although its just 'decent' in print. The only font that I can think of that would look great for interface but made for print right now is Milo... a very open design.

<div class=commentbody>Because I haven't seen people cry wolf here, I'll just do it (Slashdot was rolling like a tumbleweed) — Steve Jobs just announced in a very matter-o-fact way that:
<i>“These are devices that need to work, and you can't do that if you load any software on them.”</i> In a similar vein, Jobs said in a MSNBC article that,
<i>“Cingular doesn't want to see their West Coast network go down because some application messed up.'”</i>
In other words; Apple boasts about 48 hours that the phone *so* runs OS X, but apparently, it doesn't, as my OS X (I don't know about yours) can run quite a lot of non-Apple programs. Actually, as many as I want. And I bet, your (non-smart)phone can do this too, see Java. This is just insane. They bring a gadget with like, total geekiness, a multi-touch display with which you could probably do some cool vector drawing (finger kerning, anyone? What an idea for a Fontlab Mobile! That blows the Fontlab 360 idea out of the water) but I'm afraid we won't see anything like this now, because Steve knows so well what we want and don't want. I'll quote a slashdot critic to summarize this all;
<i>“The word "irony" is way overused, but these words, coming from a guy who started his company with money earned by selling blue boxes to defraud the phone company, belong in irony's ****ing dictionary entry. I won't buy your phone if I can't write code for it, Steve. I'm sure you're heartbroken. Me and Woz will just be over here in the corner, crying in our beards.”
Indeed.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I just can't believe that they went with 'iPhone' for a name. Sure it goes with 'iPod', but it seems too default, too generic, too obvious, and not enough to capture all that the device is. I wish they'd resurrected 'Newton'. I think Newton was a grand name that spoke of revolution and wonder; and as it's already an Apple trademark, no legal minefield!
I also can't believe us Asia/Pacific plug-hole dwellers have to wait until 2008 to get our hands on one! Though I guess that'll be enough time for all you Americans and Europeans to iron out all those first generation bugs for us. Cheers! :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>>I love love Helvetica too, but I do realize that its not the best choice for interface design. Tight apertures and not so generous counters.
With 160ppi screens and at display/heading sizes Helvetica will work here as well as it works anywhere else.
>But as already pointed out this version of Neue Helvetica is probably modified for serious interface work.
Really? Who’s saying the Neue is different from what OSX ships, and has interface mods? Also at these sizes, as discussed in other threads OS X does not use hints, but again at display sizes at 160ppi, does it need it?
>Apple has already modded Myriad- if you go to the Apple store, check out any workstation, take a peek in FontBook, there is a special version Myriad called MyriadApple.
I believe this is only used for branding? Is it included in OSX or just on those floor machines? Apple has not shown any interest (so far) in putting Myriad to use as a UI font (despite the original iPod Photo PR claims). To me the use of Helv on this device perhaps indicates a possible future move away from Myriad.

<div class=commentbody>Kristen: Ditto.
Sebastiaan: I'm also very disappointed if this rumor is true. The biggest problem with mobile is that it's mostly closed (see: the walled garden). If this iPhone is completely closed that will suck, and it will alienate a lot of potential customers.
I loved the idea of an iPhone because it has the potential to blow the doors off of carrier-mandated content. But I'm not going to buy into it if I have to replace that with OEM-mandated content.

It wouldn't surprise me. I can't imagine that Apple expects to stay cool using the same type that target often works into its direct mail.
<cite>The biggest problem with mobile is that it’s mostly closed (see: the walled garden).</cite>
And a big problem it is. I love Apple stuff, especially OS X, but $400 and and two-year Cingular contract for a phone that can't run the same third party apps I can get on a $29 phone from LG? Apparently Steve Jobs' NorCal oncologists are doing his follow-up treatment with herbal medicines.</div>
