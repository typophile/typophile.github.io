body: 'I stumbled across and old CD of fonts called the &#34;Expresiv Font Ornate
  Collection&#34;. It appears to have a lot of fonts that attempt to simulate existing
  fonts. A search took me to a web site for Tim McGuinness: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.timmcguinness.us/1994-1997/expresiv_products/index.htm"
  target="_blank">http://www.timmcguinness.us/1994-1997/expresiv_products/index.htm</a>
  <BR> <BR>Has anyone heard of this company? Any opinions about these fonts? What&#39;s
  the story? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>'

    but two people were looking for in the past few months. We have it and no idea
    where it came from either.

    of other people&#39;s fonts. I never checked them out closely enough to have any
    opinion of their quality. <BR> <BR>T

    wanted to look at it. It looked like an explosion in a presstype factory.  My
    scholarly description would boil down to smething like &#34;cheap crap from a
    carnival huckster&#34; <BR>My shoot-from-the-hip comment would be much less kind.

  body: Chris L has obviously no idea what ot takes to produce a commercial font collection.  The
    Expresiv Series was introduced at a time when a reasonable font package cost $1,000.  The
    Ornate collection, and 3 of the 6 collections were value font packages.  No excuses
    made about quality either - though most were intended for desktop users, they
    were extensively reviewed and praised at the time.  The products are not currently
    available.  And, yes, I was the publisher!  Regards, Tim McGuinness, Ph.D. - McGuinnessDesigns.com

  body: I notice that Mr. McGuiness made no comment regarding the &#34;knockoff&#34;
    statements made by other posters. Curious. <BR> <BR>  I know what it takes to
    produce a professional font collection including fair payment to the designers
    of the original fonts. I don&#39;t mean just the skilled technicians who made
    the knock-offs.  Then again you said &#34;commercial font collection&#34; implying
    the profit margin being large enough to support providing cheap type

    Was there a legal action or threat of one? or did the marketplace just speak and
    &#40; in a lack-of-sales kind of way&#41; let you know that in their &#34;review
    and appraisal&#34; was a tad less heaped with praise than your previous reviews

  body: My concern is for the original designers as well. Many of these fonts look
    very similar to existing fonts by other designers. I would like to know whether
    the original font designers &#40;or the current owners of the drawings&#41; were
    contacted or compensated in some way. <BR> <BR>I tracked down the person who originally
    purchased the Expresiv font disk. The sense she got was that large font collections
    such as Expresiv simply weren&#39;t available at the time this collection was
    sold. Perhaps Thomas or someone else can confirm or deny this claim. Was there
    a lag time in the early years of desktop publishing in acquiring an extensive
    library of fonts? <BR> <BR>Thanks for speaking up, Tim. I&#39;m sure that assembling
    this collection was not an easy task at the time. Can you address our concerns
    about the original font designers that your collection is copying? <BR> <BR>

  body: 'Well, it seems someone has an axe to grind or two. <BR> <BR>FACTS: <BR> <BR>We
    aquired full rights and ownership for several major type houses, and published
    original designs.  We also published sets from other font houses under license,
    such as Monotype.  We also published under the original publisher&#39;s name as
    well &#40; a total of 99 unique products we published by us &#41; The Expresiv
    series of 19 products included type for over a dozen type houses &#40;names changed
    to protect their brands, but they still made their piece&#41; We simply had a
    different marketing model, oriented to expanding the market, as opposed to marketing
    to elitists.  As a result, we sold 100,000&#39;s, as opposed to simply 100&#39;s.
    <BR> <BR>We also sold significant clipart collections as well - in all cases original
    work, under license, paying the designers/owners royalties &#40;as we did with
    the fonts too&#41;.  It&#39;s easy to take cheap shots when you haven&#39;t a
    clue. <BR> <BR>It would also be interesting to look up the copyright laws on fonts.  Type
    houses have been &#34;knocking&#34; each other off for 100 years, because it is
    legal.  In general, we went after original and interesting collections.  We simply
    out marketed most others. <BR> <BR>Why are the collections not available now?  Simple.  The
    primary sales tool was my Graphics Express Catalog, which was the nations leading
    graphics product catalog.  It won numerous publishing industry awards for design
    quality.  Tacky only to an elitist.  It had a subscriber based of 500,000 per
    issue.  Our list came from companies like Monotype, Adobe, Corel, and others.  The
    catalog was discontinued in 1997 after the parent company was aquired by Global
    DirectMail, and I was turned towards moving the company&#39;s 16 domestic divisions,
    and 13 european divisions onto the web.  Thus, when the catalog was closed &#40;not
    because of profitability - but because of a change in focus&#41;, the product
    line &#40;Expresiv &amp; ProVektor, and the others&#41; were also discontinued.  They
    may be brought back fairly soon however. <BR> <BR>Reviewed:  The various products
    were reviewed by a variety of publications.  Including: Adobe Magazine, Aldus
    Magazine, Arts&amp;Letters Magazine, Corel Magazine, Desktop Publishing Magazine,
    Artworx Magazine, PC Magazine, PC World Magazine, and about 50 others.  As always,
    if you want to pay the price, your welcome to, most did not. <BR> <BR>I make no
    apologies about these products.  They enabled vast numbers of customers to produce
    exceptional designs.  There was variety in quality, such as the Ornate collection
    which was intended for lower level users.  But we also produced products equal
    to the best in the market, for a 20th the price.  And yes, there were other large
    collections in the market from MonoType, Adobe, and others; with prices of $1,000
    or more!  Sometimes you make more selling for $29 than a $1,000 <BR> <BR>FYI,
    I also happen to be the co-inventor and co-designer of the worlds best selling
    low and high end forms design applications &#40;which has been in continuous distribution
    for 18 years!&#41;, as well as several major graphics apps.  I do understand the
    difference between the levels of the publishing industry.  My focus has always
    been on expanding the market by bringing quality at a lower price, as well as
    creating new product categories.  It&#39;s easy to rag on someone when you haven&#39;t
    produced yourself, but some of us actually create the products you use! <BR> <BR>Apologize
    to the list for the rant!'
