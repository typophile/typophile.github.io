    target="_blank"> No it ain&#39;t.</a> I think I recognize the shapes  <BR>though,
    so it&#39;s probably only a matter of time before this gets IDed. <BR> <BR>The
    first one I don&#39;t know...

  body: I really believe the first tee is hand lettered. The second one <i>IS</i>
    <BR><a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=204998" target="_blank">
    Treefrog</a>; the only characters that don&#39;t seem to match are the  <BR>&#34;q&#34;
    and maybe the &#34;u&#34;. It&#39;s a bit hard to make out as the tee is  <BR>not
    presented flat.
