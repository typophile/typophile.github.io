  answer I found didn't work in my case.\r\nIt\xB4s about using the calt feature to
  have different glyphs for each charakter. the code I used:\r\nfeature calt {\r\nsub
  @default @default' by @alt1;\r\nsub @alt1 @default' by @alt2;\r\nsub @alt2 @default'
  by @alt3;\r\n\r\nsub @default space @default' by @alt1;\r\nsub @alt1 space @default'
  by @alt2;\r\nsub @alt2 space @default' by @alt3;\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\n\Ltyping f.e.
  \"dog dog dog\"\Lgives me:\Ld1 o2 g3 space d1 o2 g3 space d1 o2 g3 space.\LI would
  like it to work like this:\Ld1 o2 g3 space4 d5 o1 g2 space3 d4 o5 g1\r\nI tried
  inserting the space character into all of the sets but that didn't work.\r\n\r\nHow
  does it work?\r\n\r\nThe second question I have: Now I created four opentype classes
  for EACH character. So I have four different glyphs for each charakter. BUT:  for
  example for the character \"e\", I' d prefer to have at least six alternatives.
  Is there a way to do  this without creating alternative glyphs for the whole set?
  \r\nThanks"

  body: "Most software does not treat \"space\" as a glyph for the purposes of substitution.
    \ If your text is \"d o g space c a t\", your software will probably treat that
    as two completely separate chunks: \"d o g\" and \"c a t\".  Substitution is performed
    on \"d o g\"; substitution is performed on \"c a t\"; but there is no rule that
    gets to see both the \"g\" of \"d o g\" and the \"c\" of \"c a t\".  Those two
    substitutions are performed completely independently.  The space between the words
    is handled by some other mechanism - deciding where to put the words on the page
    - and not as a glyph passed through the substitution rules.\r\n\r\nThis kind of
    question comes up sometimes when people want to detect the start or end of a word;
    and the answer in that case is that instead of looking for a space, you need to
    look for the absence of a non-space.  A rule that matches any \"c\", preceded
    by an \"ignore\" rule that matches any \"c\" that has a letter before it, will
    end up matching \"c\" only at the start of a word.  There was some discussion
    of this recently <A HREF=\"http://tug.org/pipermail/xetex/2011-February/020033.html\">on
    the XeTeX mailing list</A>.  Unfortunately, I don't think that that kind of solution
    will work for you because you want to not only match the start of the word, but
    also carry over state information from the previous word.  I'm not sure that what
    you want is possible.\r\n\r\nI suspect that you may be misusing the calt feature.
    \ As I understand it, when you have multiple forms of a glyph, those are better
    placed in the \"salt\" (stylistic alternates) feature.  The calt feature is intended
    for substitutions that genuinely depend on context - such as \"don't put two swash
    glyphs together in such a way that they collide.\"\r\n\r\nRules in the salt feature
    should produce a list of possible substitutions for each character, with \"sub
    from\".  Then it is up to the software and/or the user to choose which substitution
    to use for each character.  I don't know how that choice is made - some sources
    I've seen imply that the list is presented to the user to choose from, and others
    say that the software makes a random choice.  There's some discussion of it in
    <A HREF=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#salt\">this
    document from Microsoft</A>.\r\n\r\nThe feature file might look like this:\r\n\r\nfeature
    salt {\r\n  sub d from [d.1 d.2 d.3];\r\n  sub o from [o.1 o.2 o.3];\r\n  sub
    g from [g.1 g.2 g.3];\r\n}\r\n\r\nThen \"d o g\" might be transformed to \"d3
    o1 g2\" or \"d1 o3 g2\" or any of the 25 other possibilities, with the decision
    either being random, cyclic, or somehow made by the user."

  body: "You should make alternates for the space character, e.g. \"space.1\" etc.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think you need so many sets of alternates.\r\nI had put four sets of alternates
    in Duffy Script, for a pseudo-random effect (four sets of every character, including
    all punctuation, space, symbols), but subsequently reasoned that only two sets
    of alternates (the default and one other) might do the job, with appropriate coding,
    as explained in this document:\r\n\r\nhttp://fontshopblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/fontesque_display1.pdf\r\n"
