body: Looking to ID the U+Lc book/light weight font in the information of the business
  card. I've ID'd the bold font to be Swiss 721Bold, but the lighter font isn't quite
  Swiss 721lt. The x-height is a little smaller, I think. Any ideas?

    be it -- I'll have to get it.\r\n\r\nOn another note, I didn't realize that Swiss
    721 was a version of Helvetica, interesting!"

  body: I have successfully displayed the first picture and well, although Swiss 721
    is a Helvetica clone, that font is not Swiss 721 but original Helvetica. Lowercase
    g in Swiss 721 is a little wider.
