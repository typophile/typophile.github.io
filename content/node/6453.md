body: So i&#39;m pretty new to the boards, as i havent posted very often, but i do
  read them quite frequently. recently i&#39;ve been down and distracted and have
  realized a wonderful new job and steady income is much more of a distraction to
  creation then i had expected it would be. as a freelance graphic designer and huge
  type fan i had many goals for this, that and the other. i quickly realizing giving
  up the freedoms of freelancing also meant giving up one huge source of creative
  energy. so i&#39;m at a point now where i&#39;m beginning a search for the right
  programs and schools to achieve my masters degree in the subject of typography.
  my question to all is do you have any suggestions? i am extremely excited about
  continuing my education in typography but really do not know much when it comes
  to which schools and programs are better than others. any help would be greatly
  appreciated. i currently reside in the states...chicago, IL actually and would have
  no problem relocating to somewhere else in the states. even abroad is an option
  as i would imagine there are some really great programs across the big water....thanks

    MA Typeface Design in Reading</a>. Its one year and the list of graduates is simply
    amazing.
