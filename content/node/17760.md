body: Continuing from <a href="http://typophile.com/node/14818">this discussion</a>,
  I am currently in the process of preparing [[Jim Rimmer|Jim]]'s [[Cree Syllabics]]
  font for release, but I am a bit unsure where to start. I believe that having a
  unicode standard opentype font is the way to go, but what else do i need to provide
  for someone to be able to actually access the Cree characters? a keyboard? some
  fancy scripts? In the small bit of research i've done thus far, it seems that several
  fonts for Cree follow a keyboard layout designed to work with <a href="http://www.creeculture.ca/e/language/creekeys_pro.html">CreeKeys</a>.
  Would it just be best to adapt the fonts to this model? Anyhow, if anyone can point
  me in the right direction on this one, I'd appreciate it. Thnx.

  body: "Cree is fairly simple, since each syllable is separately encoded in Unicode,
    so there is no clever OTL stuff required. Basically, you just need to correctly
    encode each glyph according to the Unicode Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics
    code block: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1400.pdf\r\n\r\nNote that Cree
    is actually several different closely related languages, so you should probably
    check whether Jim's font supports all of these or a specific subset. I recommend
    dropping a note to Ross Mills (ross[at]tiro[dot]ca) and asking whether he is aware
    of any language-specific glyph preferences that might require use of the <locl>
    layout feature with language system tags.\r\n\r\nAvoid trying to match the font
    'layout' i.e. 8-bit encoding, to a particular keyboard driver. This just perpetuates
    non-standard 8-bit encodings that prevent reliable data interchange (because wherever
    there is one hacked encoding, there are multiple hacked encodings; I think Ross'
    Inuktitut collaborators found eight such encodings in use in Nunavut, all incompatible).
    If you want to provide support for people who are used to the CreeKeys layout,
    then use MSKLC, the Apple keyboard layout tools or KeyMan to create a Unicode
    keyboard driver with the same layout a CreeKeys."

  body: "Paul, you can download standard Cree keyboard drivers for Windows and Mac
    here: http://www.carleton.ca/ecree/en/resources.html. These packages come with
    BJCree UNI, a font containing a subset of Cree Unicode syllabics that I designed
    for Naskapi, East Cree and Swampy Cree. If you encode your font using standard
    unicode, users can type Cree using those keyboard drivers.\r\n\r\nI read Cree
    (Naskapi) syllabics. I will be interested in seeing your font in text.\r\n\r\nAlso
    look at the LanguageGeek website, Chris Harvey has produced several other Unicode
    input methods (that is, keyboard layouts) that can also access syllabics that
    are encoded as Unicode."
