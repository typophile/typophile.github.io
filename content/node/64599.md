  body: "Well, first of all, it's nice to see you trying to get out of the box.\r\nBut
    I believe there are many problems with this card.\r\n\r\n1. Why is the varnish
    spilled? In my lecture of it, with the stains on the other side, it gives a clumsy
    feel to the card. Almost like \"I won't let her paint my nails, because she is
    incapable of doing it right!\".\r\n\r\n2. The stains are all the same one, only
    quadruplicated. If you want to maintain your concept, have in mind that with repetition
    it's read like a pattern. Stains are all about randomness, not about pre-thought
    repetition simulating chaos - that's order. One stain should do the trick.\r\n\r\n3.
    I'm not sure if this is the best typographic choice for the card. It has a groovy,
    round, informal, almost childish feel to it. It's like a fat and cheerful lady:
    not slim and sofisticated. But hey, this all depend on the client (or employer)
    your seeking for.\r\n\r\n4. On composition, I believe that the first image is
    clean enough to be powerful. On the second one, things don't work. If it's meant
    to be a contrast (clean vs noisy) the second one is not chaotic enough. If it's
    meant to be as clean, reduce elements and get a more stable composition, without
    the wavy line, perhaps.\r\n\r\n5. I think that colour is just too dim. It seems
    to fade away, it's shy, wanting to hide somewhere. On one side, your client may
    present herself (through the card) in a shy manner. On the other side, her clients
    may be seeking for something they would be proud to show - that's what beauty
    is all about.\r\n\r\nThese are my two cents.\r\nHope that I wasn't too harsh and
    that this helped.\r\n\r\nPlease work on this, don't give up!\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    then make it look like the polish spilled on it. Right now the type just doesn't
    work for me.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Hey there!\r\n\r\nI love what u did with the spillage. Just and idea: Id
    use the colour of the spilled nail polish on the other side on the background....\r\nAs
    you heard the type is not working. It looks like you had just learnt to use the
    software( I used to do that when I learnt photoshop LOL) but not to worry just
    \ keep it simple and clean and you got yourself a clever design. Look at other
    sophisticated examples and get ideas from the fonts the have used. Good Luck!
    :-)"
