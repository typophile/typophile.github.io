  one</strong> seems to know what font these are.\r\n\r\nhttp://feedlimmy.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/artworks-000004718624-1a7eo5-original.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/1_4242.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate it if you guys could find both fonts, but especially the \"E.T.\"
  font."

  body: The dotted one looks like Matrise, but could be another, I suppose.

  body: "As the dotted font appears to be built on a grid you might find it on [[www.fontstruct.com|Fontstruct]],
    or you could build your own version there.\r\n\r\nI think the other might be collaged
    from photos of an actual LED display. The botched, bitmap over-drawing on \"landing
    March\" makes me think it was an image that didn't scale down clearly rather than
    a font. Also the large E and T look like they were drawn to match the letters
    in Katy Perry rather than being the same letters scaled up. \r\n\r\nHave you searched
    under LED yet?\r\n"

    don't understand what you're saying. What do you mean, search under LED?"

  body: Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you because of the unnecessarily grossly overlarge
    pictures you included. I'm sorry that none of the previous responders pointed
    this out to you.
