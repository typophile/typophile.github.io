  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am adding polytonic Greek to a font family and have a question concerning alternate glyphs. After looking at numerous examples there doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a standard for the iota diacritic glyphs especially for small caps versions. Here is what I have designed so far — please ignore spacing, etc. as this is still a work in progress.  The base glyph is uni1F8A with/without hanging diacritics, then an alternate with a regular iota instead of the iota diacritic, then a small cap uni1F8A, then a cap/small cap of it, last a small cap with a reduced iota diacritic. My question is do I need all these and have I forgotten any variations such as cap/small cap hanging diacritic? I don&rsquo;t want to go overboard, but as long as I am doing it I feel everything necessary should be included.

		<div class="commentbody">IMO, accented Greek small caps are “overboard”.
And it follows from that, that the “cap with small cap” (titlecase) version of these characters would also be unnecessary.
Save yourself a lot of work, omit accented small caps!
AFAIK, only Slimbach has created such.
But perhaps John Hudson has had a go at it.
This was discussed at Typophile, but at the moment it’s impossible to ﬁnd the thread, due to search engine problems.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your input Nick. 
I guess I passed &ldquo;overboard&rdquo; a while back since the accented small caps are already designed in the various weights for &lsquo;smcp&rsquo; and &lsquo;c2sc&rsquo;, though not yet the italic. It wasn&rsquo;t that hard to create them and I did decide to do accented small caps after looking at Arno Pro. My biggest concern is writing the feature code correctly. I will have to think about taking them out since I&rsquo;m so far along. I admit I do tend to overdo projects and then go for the easier solution. Hate to toss them out though.</div>

<p>Is that a signiﬁcant market?
Given the number of free academic Greek fonts available, unless your typeface has a corporate backer, is there any reason to put so much work into it?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for everyone&rsquo;s advice. Seriously needed and helpful.</p>
<p>I think I will go ahead and keep the accented small caps for this font family since the upright ones are done anyway. I spent about a week writing/altering various scripts to make them so finishing the italic won&rsquo;t be that much more work.</p>
<p>Since getting rich and famous from type design is never going to be an option I&rsquo;m not concerned about the market. This may be the only font I do this for though. I&rsquo;m spending a lot of time updating my existing fonts to otf (almost all production work). Feels like I&rsquo;m living in the past and I&rsquo;m dying to design some new things.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have now is writing the feature code and in looking at other faces (most notably Hypatia Sans) not having accented small caps doesn&rsquo;t seem to make that much easier. In any case I will be back with more questions as this matures.</p>
