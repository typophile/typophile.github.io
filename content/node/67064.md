body: "Hi, I'm looking for suggestions for a typeface for the header, right now I'm
  using \"Swift\" for all the text and \"Modern 216\" for the header, they feel like
  a mis-match. Any suggestions for a replacement for the body text or the header?
  Maybe a sans serif to counter the Swift and make the piece a little more contemporary?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/textcrit_3980.jpg]"

  body: "Swift was designed by Gerard Unger in 1985, and is more than capable of performing
    the task to which you have assigned it.\r\n\r\nFor the header, another design
    by Unger would certainly recommend itself. You may want to consult [[http://www.gerardunger.com/allmytypedesigns/allmytypedesigns01.html|a
    list of all his typefaces]].\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you desire a Modern face,
    both [[http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-coranto.html|Coranto]] and the
    earlier [[http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Paradox_rdrct.html|Paradox]] are drawn
    in this style. \r\n\r\nCaranto as well as [[http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-capitolium-news.html|Capitolium
    News]] both have specific Headline variants.\r\n\r\nFor a sans serif that is meant
    to be used for headlines, there is always [[http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-bigvesta.html|Big
    Vesta]].\r\n\r\nThese fonts and others can be [[http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-howto.html|ordered
    directly from Gerard Unger]]."
