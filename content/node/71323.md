  font would exploit the contextural alternates feature of open type fonts to enable
  real keyboard input to the desired number:\r\n\r\ni.e. type 1+3+5 and the resulting
  typ on screen would be an inverse bullet with the enclosed numer 135.\r\n\r\nI bought
  the CombiNumberPro, the font is great, but it is a little bit cumbersome to key
  the right combination. \r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "What you want is quite feasible.\r\nAlternate glyphs of each figure would
    be required, two for 2-digit numbers, three for 3-digit numbers, &c.\r\nThe feature
    coding is not particularly difficult, basically it is the same as for (calligraphic)
    scripts that have special forms for the beginning and ending of words.\r\nNonetheless,
    a font requires productizing, which involves not just making, but also packaging,
    distribution, and marketing, and I'm not sure there is sufficient demand for this
    kind of thing to warrant the overall effort involved for a foundry to produce
    and publish it."
