  body: "I think it looks like it was cobbled together by using pieces of Bauhaus/Pump/Blippo.
    That 'w' is surely manufactured from other letters or parts.\r\n[edit: the n,
    r and w all could have been made with a chopped up h from <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/itc-bauhaus/\">Bauhaus</a>.
    The 'a' looks normal, and the 'g' looks like maybe the tail of the g was clipped
    a bit]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
