  display font because of it swashes and elegance in bigger sizes, compared to adobe
  caslon pro italic. \r\nAnyone knows if it is still wallpaper's exclusive font?\r\nCan
  i buy it anywhere? Or can you think of any alternative fonts?\r\n\r\nAnd do you
  know an elegant dingbats font i could use with it? i need an elegant pointing hand...\r\n\r\n\r\nthan
  you,\r\n\r\njonas"

    regular italic is. See http://www.carterandcone.com/ for contact info.\r\n\r\nYou
    could also look at Caslon 540 with swashes:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/caslon-no-540/"
