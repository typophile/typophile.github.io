    for example Benton Sans, Titling Gothic, Antenna, Franklin Gothic, Etica, Dagny
    and Ibis, Republic, Droid Serif, Meta Serif, PT Serif etc.'

  body: "Certainly, Sense is more popular than Sensibility.\r\n(I refer to sales figures
    for the Shinntypes.)\r\nNot seeing too much Carter Sans or Ideal Sans, either.\r\nHowever,
    whether this situation/trend will remain or reverse is another matter.\r\n\r\nIt
    might well be that as screen resolution increases, and web browsers come to support
    expert typographic features, and web developers become more typographically informed
    now that there is large selection of webfonts, that there may be a vogue for classic
    garalde expert typography online, with drop caps, small caps, figure alternates,
    ligatures &c."
