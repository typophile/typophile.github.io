  honest and informed help.</em>\r\n\r\nI am currently at the helm of redesigning
  a major american magazine. \r\nWhat I would like to ask for is some help with properly
  infusing good typographic principles throughout the text of the mag.\r\n\r\nI am
  working in InDesign CS3 and would like to ask if any of my fellow designers/typesetters
  \ here might be able to share some wisdom and insight as to how I might tweak the
  default settings to get the best possible aesthetic and functionality out of flowed
  text ?\r\n\r\nI know this request may be a bit general / but I've just read through
  this great discussion here : http://www.typophile.com/node/16395 regarding justification
  and right ragged copy.\r\n\r\nMany great points are made in that discussion: For
  the design of this magazine I have incorporated both formats throughout. Obviously
  my concern is that the settings and details be set optimally so that I get the best
  readability out of the text.\r\n\r\nSo - Should I be using the HYPHENATION feature
  when flowing copy ? \r\n         <em>I tend to turn it on - and change the settings
  to only allow it for larger letters /\r\n         I know that one needn't use hyphenation
  on larger columns of text / but I'm typically\r\n         working in a 3 Column
  grid / on a normal Mag sized page / therefore it seems okay ?</em>\r\n\r\nShould
  I be working with Adobe Paragraph Composer / as opposed to Single Line Composer
  ?\r\n What kind of settings should I be using ?\r\n\r\nHere's another great Thread
  I was reading in hopes of getting on the right track : http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.3c0558fd\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE
  LEND ANY AND ALL ADVICE / It'd be much appreciated / and you'd be helping to steer
  a large publication in the right typographic direction! \r\n\r\nTHANKS ALL ."

  body: "Regarding the paragraph composer to single line composer, as far as I know
    you should always use the paragraph composer. The paragraph composer is a nifty
    technique in which InDesign \"looks\" not only at the line it is justifying but
    also at neighboring lines to try to calculate the best possible justification
    settings. Single line looks at each line separately, which means you're more likely
    to get rivers and lakes in text.\r\n\r\nIf you're fully justifying lines, hyphenation
    tends to be a good idea, especially if the column width is small, so that InDesign
    has small enough units to work with to keep the spacing consistent. But since
    rag left keeps the word spaces the same, hyphenation is far less necessary.\r\n\r\nCaveat:
    I'm a student whose knowledge may be more academic than practical, though I think
    it's valid."

    of a magazine. In all instances even \u2018colour\u2019 is what you should aim
    for. An example: when doing an introductory paragraph in a larger typesize than
    the body, with also a different leading/typesize ratio, you should change the
    wordspace to even out the different linespace.\r\n\r\nIt would be a major undertaking
    to explain this in every finesse (and it's something I am going to do on a professional
    basis, soon), so I will leave it here & suggest that you do a lot of experimenting
    (or hire an expert to do it for you).\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

    know I'm going to sound like a grumpy curmudgeon for saying this, but they're
    <strong>paying</strong> you to steer this large publication in the right typographic
    direction. It's <strong>your job</strong> to do it. And here you are asking for
    major help.\r\n\r\nSo my advice is, how about getting some books on working with
    type, magazine design, etc. There's even a book out there about typography and
    InDesign. Then come back with less general questions."

  body: "I agree with Ricardo. Moreover, why in the world would you ask type designers
    about setting type?\r\n\r\nHere are a few observations from a compositor, with
    the caveat that I have 20+ years setting type with TeX, but less than a year with
    ID CS2.\r\n\r\nParagraph composer versus single-line composer: In general, if
    you take the time to get the min-ideal-max spaceband settings optimized for a
    particular typeface, particular size, and particular measure, it will set better
    type. If you do not, then the single-line composer will set better type. If you
    think about it, you will see why, but for what it is worth, I've tested this notion
    on a limited basis and found it correct so far.\r\n\r\nAs to hyphenation and all
    the rest . . . All typesetting involves compromises. Making the best compromises
    depends on the particular standards of an audience. That audience is ideally the
    readers, but in practice is apt to be the editors and/or the designers. There
    are formal standards, too. AP style is different than \"Chicago\" style, and both
    different from MLA style. Legal style has variations too -- the Harvard \"Blue\"
    being one style for legal works.\r\n\r\nIf all this were cookbook, the people
    at Adobe are smart enough to have pre-programmed settings; if not just one, then
    \"book\" \"magazine\" \"newspaper\" etc. But setting type isn't a cookbook problem,
    and they're smart enough to recognize that, too."

    was just hoping to engage in a conversation which may bring me some technical
    insight which I might not have found in the books and manuals I have read. I've
    always found it best to learn from those more versed than I and further more I'd
    hate to think that I'd be above asking for help or advice simply because of my
    position.\r\n\r\nThat being said.\r\nBert - I agree with you whole-heartedly and
    I believe my approach to this particular design problem has been intuitive and
    it has been about maintaining a proper \"colour\" to the copy of the magazine.\r\n\r\nRicardo
    & Charles - I appreciate your words. I know that typography is something of great
    nuance and as such I see it as something that demands a curiosity and willingness
    to learn in order to really excel at it's application. I've studied type under
    some noted\r\ntypographers at PRATT in NY as well as Cal Arts. I understand some
    of the underlying theories of good type as detailed in texts like <em>The New
    Typography</em> & <em>The Crystal Goblet</em>. Regardless I just sought to get
    some tips & pointers from any editorial design pros that may frequent these forums.
    \r\n\r\nI've only used inDesign for the last 3 years and I had wondered if anyone
    here might be able to share with me some user tips or tricks - insight into their
    working process.\r\n\r\nFor example : \"Here's an option you might have missed
    in the H&J's settings that really makes a difference\"\r\nor \"The best way to
    insert manual breaks is . . .  \"\r\n\r\n<em>Stuff like that.</em>\r\n\r\nAgain,
    I apologize for the general questions. I was simply hoping to get a variety of
    responses and pick up the dialogue from there.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles - thanks for
    taking the time out to site some of the settings I should be focused on. I'll
    be sure to research\r\nand experiment with the min-ideal-max spaceband settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHANKS

    the paragraph composer and tweak the settings with your line length and type size
    combination. Adjust your hyphen limit and break options to handle most situations

    one which is a bit more lenient on hyphenation for problematic situations. The
    problems come with editing after layout. Reserve your single line work for just

  body: "Pardon my suspicion: Why would a major magazine want you to head up it's
    redesign?\r\n\r\nI know books, not magazines, but the first things I think of
    with magazines are:\r\n\r\n1. All the advertisements have to get in.\r\n\r\n2.
    The pictures (images) are at least as important as the text.\r\n\r\n3. There will
    always be a lot of material that will bleed, and some material that won't quite
    fit a grid. \r\n\r\n4. By in large, you need to fit is as much of the scheduled
    text as you can.\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nMuch of this isn't true for books; depends
    on the type of book.\r\n\r\nNow don't you think the kinds of compromises you need
    to make in setting the text for the above are going to be quite different than
    for setting text in a book?\r\n\r\nI can't stress enough that every decision in
    setting type is a compromise; that all the aesthetic rules of \"good type\" come
    with presuppositions about what you are doing."

  body: "Here are my thoughts on a few things about InDesign text setting for a magazine.\r\n\r\nFirst,
    a lot depends on your typical line lengths and the typeface you're using. Knowing
    that would help a fair bit. That being said....\r\n\r\nSecond, IMO the paragraph
    composer will almost always give results that are as good as or better than the
    single-line composer - usually better. However, extra work in adjusting line breaks
    is the cost of this, as noted.\r\n\r\nThird, rather than trying to *control* the
    paragraph composer, you should be thinking about how to *influence* it. It's much
    easier to stop it from doing something you don't way than to make it do something
    you do want. In particular, careful and limited use of \"no break\" formatting
    is usually the best way to get it to keep stuff together or otherwise influence
    its line breaking decisions. In a pinch, switch the entire paragraph to the single
    line composer and manually tweak the line breaks.\r\n\r\nFourth, if you're using
    a well-made typeface, mostly use \"metrics\" kerning rather than \"optical\" kerning.
    BUT, the latter is still useful when mixing type sizes/styles or trying to correct
    for the omission of a specific kern pair in the text. Stick the cursor between
    the two letters and change the kerning to \"optical\" to just affect that combo.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    InDesign has that really handy slider (code name: Nigel) that lets you control
    the tradeoff between hyphenation and spacing. If you don't like hyphenation, don't
    turn it off! Instead, adjust the slider to the point where you are happy with
    that tradeoff. That allows InDesign to still hyphenate when the alternative is
    really bad. (My own opinion it that there's nothing wrong with hyphenation, and
    I'd much rather have a few hyphens than lousy spacing, so I put the slider pretty
    far the other way. But I recognize that there are diverse opinions on this issue.)\r\n\r\nHope
    those tips help.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\nThomas Phinney\r\nProduct Manager\r\nFonts

  body: "I have a few more suggestions:\r\n1) Use the paragraph composer. The paragraph
    composer should significantly reduce the number of lines that need manual adjustments
    to improve color. One reason some magazines don't use it is because they are concerned
    about the effects of late-stage edits (the entire paragraph could reflow). However,
    it doesn't affect more than 1 paragraph and the change is generally the best alternative.\r\n2)
    Turn off the hyphenation zone (set it to zero) and experiment with real layouts
    with real text with different hyphenation-slider settings (like Thomas suggests).\r\n3)
    For things like headlines or pull-quotes, you can turn off hyphenation and try
    using \"Balance Ragged Lines\" which does a first-pass at balancing the line lengths
    (it doesn't do it grammatically, just mathematically).\r\n"

  body: "My advice is to experiment with the Justification (H&J) settings, fine tuning
    them for the column width, typeface, size, and leading.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in
    InDesign, minimum word space is set to less than 100% by default. (80%?). The
    same is true for Quark.\r\nBut if you like the old-school look of letterpress,
    then set the minimum to 100%. And letter spacing should be zero!--anything else
    is desktop publishing.\r\n\r\nLook for the sweet spot of type size, leading, and
    line-length where everything falls into place. It may be something unusual like
    8.3 on 9.7. Some typographers will even nuance tracking and horizontal scaling
    too, e.g. -5 tracking and 97.5% scaling.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that there is no
    ideal size and leading, as the nominal size of x-height and extender length varies
    from face to face.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
