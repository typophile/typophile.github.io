  body: It really would be a sad day if St Bride were closed. I would hope, in the
    very least, the contents wouldn't just get buried in a storage unit. Didn't this
    happen to the Type Library?

  body: Yes I went to the Type Library to take the photos for an article about the
    Library and was surprised that we where told it's too late it's dead. And the
    British Library is taking everything and putting it in storage and probably won't
    see the light of day again. So let's hope that isn't what happens to St. Brides.

    there fairly regularly. The last time we went we were given a wonderful lecture
    on the history of hot metal and compositing by librarian Nigel Roche. After the
    demonstration, the students got to have a go at using the presses. (All for a
    very reasonable price too. Perhaps too reasonable for these days?) \r\n\r\nYou

  body: "What the BBC account presents is a journalist's version of plans that have
    been developed to drastically improve St Bride Library. The \xA37m ($14m) sought
    is not simply 'To save the library' but the cost of a major refurbishment of the
    building, the fruits of which would include:\r\n\r\nBuilding of new exhibition
    and reading rooms within the present lightwell void with a four-fold increase
    in the number of books on open access to the public.\r\n\r\nRefurbishment of the
    existing reading room as a special collections area and return of the Blades Library
    to its pristine Victorian state as the heart of the collection.\r\n\r\nCreation
    of a working demonstration area for the artefact collection with glass-screened
    viewing zone, coupled with refurbishment of the raked Victorian classroom adjacent
    to the demonstration area.\r\n\r\nInstallation of a passenger lift serving most
    levels of the building, augmented by stair lifts, and rationalization of the numerous
    floor levels to improve access for all.\r\n\r\nProvision of a dedicated book lift
    between stacks and reading room.\r\n\r\nCreation of a BS5454 : 2000 compliant
    archive storage area.\r\n\r\nProvision of a substantial ground-floor cafe / bar
    area and an additional meeting room.\r\n\r\nImprovements to the theatre area to
    provide a multi-use theatrical / conference facility.\r\n\r\nImposing new entrance
    area from Bride Lane.\r\n\r\nThat's quite a bag of improvements for the money.\r\n\r\nAfter
    the improvements the business model is a healthy one and the future bright; without
    it the library is expensive to run and cannot continue indefinitely.\r\n\r\nFundraising
    is beginning to bear fruit, but the pace needs to quicken as the building works
    are anticipated to begin in mid-2008. Anyone wishing to assist should contact
    the library at http://www.stbride.org."

  body: "To answer the question 'Is the St Bride Library in danger of closing?' fully,
    one needs to accept a number of points. Firstly, it is intended that the Library
    will close for the period of the building works in any event; the real question
    is will it reopen afterwards. Exciting plans have been prepared to radically improve
    an old and quirky building, and those plans have been approved by the relevant
    civic authorities, with final approval given only last month. The money to carry
    out the works is now needed and there is a fundraising strategy in place. Application
    has been made to the main UK heritage funding body for half the sum required and
    our own efforts are bearing fruit. However the project still needs a not-inconsiderable
    amount of money to be secured in the next few months so that it can be assured
    of success.\r\n"
