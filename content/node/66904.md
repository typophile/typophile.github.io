  each time with a \"Page not found\". So I was wondering if anyone could point me
  in the direction of any research, links or particular faces in the area of dot matrix
  and digital faces used on public transport. I mean on the boards that give destination
  and up to date info.\r\n\r\nI have AF Track and Video Wall by ACME. Various other
  dot matrix faces but any other info or pointers greatly received.\r\nThanks."

  body: "I did some research on this a while ago. At least in Germany (where I focused
    my research), it seems to be common practice for manufacturers of LED or \xABflipdot\xBB
    displays for public transport to design the fonts in-house, which means the fonts
    are their proprietary designs and never leave the system they're designed for.*
    Some companies I believe include a little \xABfont editor\xBB in their package
    so that clients can futz around with the fonts themselves.\r\n(* But of course
    they're easily reconstructed, outside the system. If you just need something that
    has a similar look, search \xABdot matrix\xBB or \xABterminal\xBB at MyFonts and/or
    other places and you'll find more than you can possibly want ;-).)\r\n\r\nBTW,
    of course this doesn't mean these companies have [type] designers working there\u2026
    One guy I spoke to said (once he understood what I was asking about), oh, their
    <em>customer service department</em> is in charge of \xABmaking the letters\xBB.
    Granted, you don't have very many options on such a coarse grid, so most of the
    stuff still ends up somewhat legible; but this certainly helps explain why many
    of these displays seem to lack basic typographic sensitivity (like those crammed-in
    descenders. Hey, who really needs those sticks if we can save two lines of LEDs!).
    \r\nThere's been a bunch of work on legibility requirements, but those only look
    at things like contrast, brightness of LEDs and letter size, not really the design.
    It sure seems like an area where there's still a lot that can and hopefully will
    be done for design.\r\n\r\nAnd, the search is broken at the moment, try using
    Google (restrain your search using \xABsite:typophile.com\xBB)."
