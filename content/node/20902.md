  it affects our image as creative thinkers and visual communicatiors.\r\n\r\n"

    Helvetica Black Condened to 200% instead of using Helvetica Black Extended. He
    used RGB-images at 72 dpi & blew them up to somewhere between 150 & 200% (in Quark,
    not changing the image size in Photoshop). It's a miracle the company survived
    so long ;-)\r\nAt one point, I started keeping a log of all the things he f*cked
    up, but after only a few days I had to give that up because it was far too time-consuming.\r\nOh,
    and he always used the bold/italic/...-\"styles\" instead of the proper fonts.
    Any idea how ugly a bold, italic University Roman looks like?"

    you are entirely correct: only truly ignorant people believe that they know everything
    that can be known about a particular subject or subjects: every truly intelligent
    person I have ever known has not been afraid to admit his or her ignorance on
    a great many subject, even their own fields of expertise.\r\n\r\nIgnorance is
    no crime: we are all born ignorant, and overcome it to varying degrees as we grow..."

    digression ...\r\nI have reached a stage of my visual design career, where I now
    feel I HAVE to focus more on the process, the experimentation, the discovery of
    ideas and solutions that may not have been discovered whilst thinking \"we've
    only got THIS time to produce a (e.g) financial report\" or \"the client has given
    us examples of what they'd like\" - until now I believe my understanding of brief
    delivery and interpretation has existed within a kind of bubble. It's bursting
    that bubble ... I think ... that holds truly good ideas and truly rewarding results
    for a career I love.\r\n\r\nBasically ... the future is bright, adn bright is
