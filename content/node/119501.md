body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone who had some familiarity with greek
  might be able to answer a couple of questions for me which I've been unable to track
  down.\r\n\r\nFirst, I was curious as to whether the characters stigma and digamma,
  when used as numerals, are interchangeable or whether there are specific context
  in which each is favoured.\r\n\r\nSecond, In actual greek usage is it commonplace
  to make use of numeric stigma (U+03DB) or is plain vanilla stigma (U+03C2) more
  commonly used (as a number)? And does this differ between everyday use and professional
  typography?\r\n\r\nFinally, do any of the characters in the range U+03E2\u2013U+03EF
  have any actual use in Greek (modern or ancient)? I ask this because I've come across
  lots of fonts which contain these characters, and in which there appears to have
  been some attempt to harmonize the design of these characters with Greek, but which
  lack the Coptic range altogother. I can't figure out what possible use these characters
  would be without the rest of the coptic block, but perhaps they're used as technical
  symbols or something?\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "John Hudson is probably the best person to answer, but I can offer a few
    opinions.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase digamma and stigma are both equal to \"6\" as numerals,
    but they are not interchangeable. In modern Greek, only the stigma form would
    be used; the F-shaped digamma is an exclusively ancient form that is only used
    when transcribing ancient inscriptions or writing about ancient Greek dialects.
    For a bit of history of how stigma came to replace digamma, see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digamma]]\r\n\r\nTypographically,
    U+03C2 is not stigma (although Unicode claims it is called that in spoken Greek).
    It is the word-final form of sigma, and never means the same thing as stigma (U+03DB).\r\n\r\nThe
    Coptic letters in the Greek block are a leftover from when Unicode was trying
    to unify scripts as much as possible, before the Coptic block was created. As
    far as I know, they are never used in Greek."

    existed in Greek writing before they were appropriated by mathematicians, rather
    than being created by them. Or at least they were used in typography of Greek
    texts in the Latin-alphabet-using parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThus, there's the normal
    lowercase delta, \u03B4, and then there's the form used to indicate a partial
    derivative, but Unicode has <em>that</em> one in with the mathematical symbols.\r\n\r\nAh,
    you must be referring to \u03F5 as against \u03B5 for epsilon.\r\n\r\nThere's
    even a page about this:\r\n\r\n[[https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Epsilon.html]]"

    that $\\phi$ in a TeX file produces a closed phi in a mathematical formula and,
    to get the curled shape, $\\varphi$ is to be used. \r\n\r\nTo my knowledge shapes
    have not changed since then, except for the letter delta for which Knuth changed
    his mind at some point in time; cf http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/cm.html

    1992)*\r\n\r\nToday, with XeTeX and LuaTeX and opentype fonts, the  xits fontface
    \ http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/xits/ comes with six fonts, the four standard
    fonts for text and two fonts for mathematics (math and mathbold). With Microsoft
    Office 2011 for the Macintosh, Cambria comes with five font files, the four standard
    fonts and one math font file.\r\n\r\nI don't know the inner workings but I would
    expect that you are free to choose whatever shape you prefer in the text fonts
    and whatever other shape is better for the math fonts (that is  relevant for upright
    Greek letters used  with French mathematics for instance). \r\n\r\n*The metafont

    This lowercase Greek alphabet was prepared by D. E. Knuth in December, 1979,\r\n%
    inspired by the Monotype faces used in {\\sl The Art of Computer Programming}.\r\n%
    (It has been designed for math formulas, not Greek texts.)\r\n% The programs were
    revised for the new \\MF\\ conventions in 1985.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nand there
