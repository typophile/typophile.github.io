  but I'm a bit confused about the various fonts in the family. It seems that John
  Baskerville is for type 11pt and up and Baskerville Ten is for type 10pt and smaller,
  but where do John Baskerville Text and John Baskerville Tx N fit in? John Baskerville
  Text looks very similar to Baskerville Ten, but they don't seem to be identical.
  I have no idea what Tx N means.\r\n\r\nThanks"
