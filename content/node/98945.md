  standard fonts used in textbooks in the 1950s? Was there geographical differentiation?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "In the 1950s in the US, there were well-established textbook publishers that
    published for a national market, so there probably few differences between one
    part of the US and another. If you're interested in geographical variations between
    the US and other countries, I'm afraid I'm not familiar with what textbooks outside
    the US looked like.\r\n \r\nDid Canada have its own home-grown textbook industry
    at that time? If not, was Canada importing textbooks from the UK? Most US book
    typesetting in the 1950s was done on the Linotype, but in the UK, Monotype was
    the standard. \r\n\r\nThe US textbook publisher Ginn and Co. (long since absorbed
    by Pearson Education) commissioned Morris Fuller Benton to design Century Schoolbook.
    American Type Founders released it in 1919 and later licensed it to other major
    manufacturers of typesetting machines, including Linotype. It was widely used
    in the US for textbooks for kindergarten through Grade 8.\r\n\r\nIt's possible
    that you're asking about secondary textbooks (Grades 9-12 in the US) or college
    textbooks. In the 1950s, these looked very different from elementary (Grades K-8)
    textbooks. They used fewer illustrations and little or no color. They looked more
    like the trade books of the era, and would have used the same Linotype faces commonly
    used for trade books at the time, such as W.A. Dwiggins' Caledonia. \r\n\r\nLinotype
    casts a whole line of type on one metal slug, but Monotype casts each character
    as a separate piece. This makes Monotype much better for complex equations, fractions,
    and tabular matter, so even in the US, mathematics texts were often set on the
    Monotype. "

  body: "Thanks all! \r\n\r\nI think Canada would have had its own textbook industry,
    as cross border trade was much less then. Also, the influence of the UK was still
    quite strong, especially culturally. As textbook design is both industrial and
    cultural, with the former influence by the US and the latter by the UK, it really
    is an interesting question.\r\n\r\nI was thinking more about university level
    texts, specifically economics textbooks. I believe that in Canada these would
    have been more likely to be US American. I remember looking at some old textbooks
    and their design was very different compared to the design of contemporary textbooks.
    I'm delivering a lecture on economics and have to design some PP slides of it.
    I thought I'd try to replicate the design feel of those old textbooks, hence my
    question.\r\n\r\nThanks again for this and any additional info you can offer. "

  body: "Here's something else to factor in. In the 1950s, a full set of Linotype
    matrices suitable for the demands of textbooks (roman, italic, bold, and in 8,
    9, 10, 11, and 12 point) cost around 2 thousand dollars (in 1950 dollars). \r\n\r\nIn
    other words, about the same cost as a new car.\r\n\r\nThe result was most printers
    didn't have that many *text* fonts. Secondly, the more complex the material (in
    terms of fonts required), the more magazines needed, and more expensive the Linotype
    machine. You could use a typical machine & change magazines, but that cost, too.
    \r\n\r\nAlso, printing more than about 5,000 copies meant using stereo plates
    and the presses needed to run them. The cast type wouldn't hold up for more than
    about 5,000 impressions. (Monotype was harder, but was still limited to about
    7,000 impressions.)\r\n\r\nSo, the types used were in some measure limited by
    what was available from your favorite long-run printer. They weren't going to
    add a font family to satisfy some designer's whim. \r\n\r\nAs I remember, favorite
    typefaces of that day for adult reading were versions of Janson, Baskerville,
    Garamond, Caledomia (or an equivalent Monotype Scotch), Times Roman, etc. Some
    modern fonts like Bodoni were making inroads, but not, probably, in many textbooks."

  body: "One thing is that after Century Schoolbook, some textbook publishers would
    have specified Caslon, because that typeface was, to some extent, felt to embody
    the canonical form, the abstract ideal, of the Latin script - at least in some
    quarters.\r\n\r\nCaslon... and nondescript Scotch Roman faces... were, at least,
    what one would see in nineteenth-century textbooks.\r\n\r\nSadly, my copy of Smith,
    Muzzey. and Lloyd isn't immediately at hand."

  body: The textbooks used for introductory English at my schools in Japan are interesting.  They
    use a large neo-grotesque type (very similar to Helvetica but with a single-story
    'a') for the first 1/3 or so of the first year text.  Then they abruptly change
    over to using Century Schoolbook, in gradually decreasing point size, through
    to the end of the third and final year.
