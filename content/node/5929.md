  always helped me solve my problems, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be coming back for

  file from <a href="http://www.brandsoftheworld.com" target="_blank">www.brandsoftheworld.com</a>
  but that only contains those main charachters. <BR> <BR><a href="http://web.brandsoftheworld.com/download/?id=4838"

  used the &#34;whatthefont&#34; function of myfonts.com but couldn&#39;t find the
  font. I was hoping someone could help me.

    alt="mcdonnell"> <BR> <BR>My guess is that it was custom-drawn some 40 years ago.
    It bears similarities to various faces, but there&#39;s an unevenness that I think
    either speaks to the original design or a bad digitization of the original. Either
    way I don&#39;t know what would match it.'

  body: You do realize that McDonnell Douglas no longer exists, right? It merged with
    Boeing, and now has become just a graphic element in the <a href="/www.boeing.com/flash.html"
    target="_blank">Boeing logo</a>. I worked at Boeing as an engineer for 32 years,
    and retired about 3 years after the merger.

    <BR> <BR>Anyway, I though that I could still find the font with the help of the
    people here. <BR> <BR>If I may ask of you, do you have some sort of papers with
    the &#34;DC-10&#34; letters? If you do, could you perhaps scan that and send me
    an e-mail? I only need the &#34;1&#34; and &#34;0&#34; letters actually. Others
    are already available from the eps file.

  body: Sorry, I was not in the airplane part of the company at any time in my career.
    I worked on missiles and space programs.  Some old airplane books might help get
    the idea, but usually the plane model lettering was from the airlines typefaces,
    not the manufacturer, as far as I recall.
