  body: Not sure what you're asking. Are all the letters intended to be Latin or are
    some Armenian? Either way, I don't read them as anything recognizable (except
    for AYTOU, obviously).

    to see the last letter as an L but the complexity of the terminal disqualifies
    that."

    is, and \"AYTOU\" with some abstract shapes before and after it is a valid guess.
    If that's your best guess. :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Maybe I'm too literal minded, but I see it as a word in a language I don't
    understand, so I don't try to read it. If pressed, I would say "hAYTOU(hand)".

    latter is more difficult to integrate, because we\u2019re more accustomed to big
    fancy and sometime weird looking initials than cut off finals.*\r\n\r\n* Wondering
    how I read it as |h|, it occurred to me now that it could resemble a blackletter
    |H|."

  body: "Haytouy? Fiatouy? Unfortunately, the beginning and end characters are too
    ambiguous for quick recognition by Latin-alphabet users.\r\n\r\nI suspect the
    first letter is H, simply because I know that \"Hay...\" begins the Armenian word
    for Armenian. But that's not going to be apparent to most people who see this.\r\n\r\nSo
    the first letter looks like F, Fi, or h, and the last letter looks like y or G
    - but not close enough in either case for them to be recognizable.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    indeed, I have been able to find out the [[http://ayfwest.org/programs/haytoug/archive/|spoiler.]]\r\n\r\nSo
    this is a new logo, used on the Summer 2014 issue of their publication. Hrant
    can take our comments back to them to explain that their logo is just a tad too
    ambiguous, and needs a redesign."

  body: "Thanks for playing along guys.\r\n\r\nThe \"h\" sound in Armenian is the
    letter \"\u0540\"/\"\u0570\" and the \"gu\" sound is \"\u053F\"/\"\u056F\". So
    it's \"HAYTOUG\" (which means \"freedom fighter\" in Armenian) so I guess it's
    close but no cigar. Since I have nativity in Armenian I can't tell, which is why
    I asked.\r\n\r\n* BTW the lowercase only became so Latinized in the late 19th
    century.\r\n\r\nI would tell them about the problem (one day I'm sure I will,
    afforded the right pretext) but since it's a volunteer operation I'm unlikely
    to get more than puzzled indignation...\r\n\r\nBTW it's tempting to think this
    sort of thing is only read by people who already know how to read it anyway, but
    of course that ignores the high value of spreading our message to \"odar\"s (non-Armenians).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Having found the publication and having glanced at the contents of a few
    issues, it may be just as well. Yes, the Armenian people have a message to spread,
    but the wrong person reading it could get the impression that it's put out by
    a bunch of terrorists or something.\r\n\r\nThe Armenian homeland is in a very
    difficult situation; in order to have the ability to defend its people from attack,
    as in Nagorno-Karabazh, the regime has had to put itself on, as it were, the wrong
    side of history. I don't think now is the time to encourage Armenians in the United
    States to make aliyah; they won't be able to help change the corrupt regime there,
    they will just end up making Putin stronger.\r\n\r\nWhile in most cases, the saying
    \"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade\" is just a facile response to those
    in bad situations, it has occurred to me that there may be some applicability
    here.\r\n\r\nYes, it is a problem that Armenians in the United States are so comfortable
    in their part of the diaspora that not enough of them are seriously considering
    a return to the homeland. And now is not the time when adventurers could follow
    in the footsteps of Teddy Roosevelt or Alexander Hamilton and carve out an alternative
    base for the Armenian people, so they could avoid having to rely on the powerful
    and risk losing their freedom.\r\n\r\nBut hope is staring the Armenian people
    in the face.\r\n\r\nIf someone who looks like he could be Kim Kardashian's husband
    can become the President of the United States of America, then why couldn't someone
    who looks like he could be Kim Kardashian's brother?"
