  getting the best brightness and contrast between colours? I'm working on a kid's
  book with a mostly black cover with lines picked out in red and white; I want the
  black to be as black as death and the red to be as bright as oxgenated blood (currently
  I'm using PMS 032). I've only ever used matt laminates up to now and would appreciate
  a 'ruling' from the court.\r\n\r\nFor your general info: the file is in 3 colour
  with a 30% cyan screen laid down first then the pantone red bits and then process
  black to overprint the Cyan.\r\n\r\nI'll try and post an image of a detail of the
  cover ... Wow, that never seems to work, OK so here's a <a href = \"http://home.iprimus.com.au/nkgross/SBcover_test.png\">
  link </a> to it\r\n\r\ncheers"

    certain lighting.

  body: "It will probably look a bit more saturated. If you are going all PMS, look
    at the different blacks offered\u2014that could really make the difference. So
    maybe drop the screen mixes and just use the PMS colors for the best look."

  body: Can you do a spot varnish on the red? I find matte lam makes a richer, denser
    black without the glare. But if you can pick up the red or white with a spot gloss
    that would look cool.

  body: "Hi Patty,\r\n\r\nIt sounds like a continuation of a similar conversation
    we had recently ;) once again, as with most of the stuff I do, it's a question
    of budget. I had the same idea and it would definately look awesome I agree but
    unfortunately ... money is the issue. I am waiting earnestly for the time I can
    do spot varnishing :)\r\n\r\nJames, I thought that if i dropped the screens I'll
    be left with a gray or brown black or do you reckon it's a goer? Do you reckon
    a Pantone black would be as dark as a rich black?\r\n\r\nthanks guys"

  body: Rather than running process for the black consider a double bump of Black
    6, or another black if you want a warm tint.

  body: If it's the cover of a kids book, you want it to be as durable as possible,
    so laminated would seem the way to go there. If you can do the colors with a varnish
    then all the better.

    that's the way I would produce the artwork as well (though I like 20% cyan; never
    tried 30%). Without going to 2 hits of a Pantone, your technique yields nice blacks.
    \r\n\r\nLaminating offers the best protection to inks but will obscure any varnish
    effects, so even if you had the budget for extra varnish, the lamination would
    kill it.\r\n\r\nI've used both gloss and matte laminates. I prefer matte myself,
    but I think gloss would give you more satisfaction on this job.\r\n\r\nGood luck.
    Let us know how it turns out.\r\n"

  body: Yes, thermography is a bit plastic and tacky (compared to engraving), but
    it's thick and shiny and would be OK with your loosely rendered big type, and
    stand out well against an uncoated stock.

  body: "As Ken mentions, laminating can kill a varnish. Obviously, the varnish needs
    to run after the lam. \r\n\r\nWhen I've mixed gloss and matte on a cover before,
    I've found that it often works better to do a gloss lam and then hit it with a
    matte varnish to kill the sheen except in the areas where you want the sparkle.
    Not just picking out a matte spot; even when matte is most of the cover.\r\n\r\nI've
    also had bad experiences with certain matte laminations that really shift color
    -- bad red shift, more than can be adequately compensated on press beforehand.
    Sometimes, gloss lam plus flood matte varnish worked better for color fidelity.
    \r\n\r\nI've done a few matte lams with a spot gloss varnish. Doesn't really give
    you full gloss, obviously. Depends upon whether you're picking out type or images.
    \r\n\r\nAnd this may also be completely in my imagination: but it seems to me
    that matte lams are more susceptible to curl. But it can really depend upon the
    lamination -- not all plastics are created equal. Which printer/manufacturer can
    make a difference.\r\n\r\nI always consult with my production manager (and I let
    her work out the budget ;-)\r\n\r\n-- K."

    link are quite accurate, although the red looks more fluorescent in reality).
    The brown (412c) is matt laminated and the red is spot varnished gloss. I think
    red 458c will probably be even more bright on an even darker background.\r\n\r\nJust
    wanted to share my experience whith such a color contrast, not trying to plug.
