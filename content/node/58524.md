  an answer to a burning question I have on ye olde Google. So I thought I'd ask here.\r\n\r\nWhy
  are some em rules/dashes, as far as I can understand, smaller than an em; Times
  New Roman versus Times for example. Is this up to the type designer?\r\n\r\nAlek"

  body: "I don\u2019t know for sure, but as a former ad agency type director and former
    advertising type shop manager, I can say that the discrepancy probably stems from
    advertising agency guidelines established in the 1960s and \u201970s, when film
    setting displaced Linotypes, Monotypes, and Ludlows (the machines, not the foundries),
    though it may have happened earlier. During this time period, short column measures
    were popular, and long em-dashes clashed with the tightly-set typography that
    was then popular.\r\n\r\nAgency guidelines often stated something similar to this:
    \u201Cen-dashes, with a thin space on either side (note: not a word space) are
    to be substituted for em-dashes for all composition.\u201D Many ITC faces have
    short em-dashes, too, though many do not. I believe that foundries often dictated
    the length of em- and en-dashes, too, and that there has never been a definitive
    standard. How many Times and Times New Roman versions are out there\u2014again
    I don\u2019t know; FontBank\u2019s Times Black features an em-dash which is shorter
    than the en-dash, and Monotype have released at least dozens of versions\u2014but
    they are all based upon Victor Lardent\u2019s drawings, supervised by Monotype
    contractor Stanley Morison,  for <em>The Times</em>, a London daily, where the
    face first appeared on October 3, 1932; you could look at microfilms of that paper
    or contact Monotype to find which em-dash length is original. \r\n\r\nJim Craig
    published Y&R\u2019s typographic guidelines, written by Klaus Schmidt and Roy
    Zucca, in his book, <em>Typography for the Graphic Designer</em>.\r\n\r\nI hope
    this helps, but I\u2019ve probably just further muddied the waters."

  body: "I remember reading somewhere, that in continental Europe, em-dashes were
    often cast with hairline gaps on either side, to allow for setting them flush
    against the type without spacing material. Whereas North American and English
    foundries had them run across the entire body, so that the sorts could be used
    to form lines.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal Art

  body: 'I believe oprion is correct, and that explains the need for the thin space
    in the agency specifications. And if memory serves, foundry (hand-set) types were
    cast with the hairline gaps, as oprion says was the case in Europe. '

  body: "@ Cameron: \r\n\"agency guidelines\"!? It's amazing to read that they existed.
    When I was an ad agency type director in Minneapolis in the late 1980s and early
    1990s, no one gave a flying fumble about what dashes looked like except me, the
    type director. & when I put in 3/4 em dashes on full em width, no one noticed.\r\n\r\n@
    Craig:\r\nIn metal type, em dashes shorter than full em width did exist, but were
    hard to find. Good Monotype shops (such as Mackenzie & Harris in San Francisco)
    routinely substituted a 3/4-em dash in the matrix case for the full em dash, but
    cast it on the full em width. That's where I learned the practice. I carried that
    practice with me to the early days of PostScript fonts, when we had not yet gotten
    the richness and sophistication we have now. But that meant that I'd most often
    have to do a search-and-replace to get rid of the full-width em dash and replace
    it with a 3/4-em dash on full em width.\r\n\r\nMy experience with foundry metal
    was that most faces had full-width em dashes. That seems to contradict Cameron's
    statement, I know.\r\n\r\nI cannot recall seeing en dashes less than full en width.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n\r\nPS:
    I just recalled that when I worked at M&H, the owner was a Swiss guy. maybe that
    accounts for the 3/4-em dashes."
