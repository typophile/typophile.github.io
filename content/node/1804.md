  kind of stupid question, but i know that still lots of people use font meant for
  display as &#40;long-&#41;text font and i can&#39;t say for myself that i&#39;m

  body: It used to be easy to tell the difference when there were different methods
    for setting text and than there were for display. In fact, you didn&#39;t need
    to know there <i>was</i> a difference. It&#39;s just the way it was done and you
    didn&#39;t have any choice when specifying type.  <BR> <BR>The line started getting
    blurry with phototypesetting systems and digital type. There was also a trend
    in the 70s &#40;notably promoted by ITC&#41; to create typefaces that were suitable
    for both text and display with only one design. <BR> <BR>Personally, I think that
    losing the distinction between the two has been generally a bad thing. Many popular
    typefaces that have gone from metal to phototypesetting to digital have left their
    display cuts behind. The cuts you see now were generally designed for 12 point
    and many of them don&#39;t look that good large. You used to be able to get the
    display cut with headline setting phototype machines or even rub down letters.
    The display cuts have, for the most part, not made it to the digital typesetting
    world. <BR> <BR>Typefaces designed in the last 20 years are perhaps a different
    story. The same machines are used for both text and display and type designers
    are aware of this and, presumably, take this into account. It&#39;s been unusual
    to see typefaces released with different designs for text and display, but there
    are exceptions. House Industries has some like this, and I know there are others.
    <BR> <BR>I really miss the display cuts of certain classic typefaces like Garamond
    &#40;ATF&#41;, News Gothic, Futura, Bodoni &#40;ATF&#41;, even Helvetica. They
    are simply not availble in digital form and we are left with the clunky text cuts
    if we want to use them.

  body: There is no easy formula. And theories and principles will only take you so
    far.  <BR> <BR>The best way to understand the difference between the properties
    of text and display fonts is to examine the differences in a typeface that has
    both. For instance Slimbach&#39;s Adobe Jenson, with its &#34;optical scaling&#34;,
    ITC Bodoni, any one of many serif faces from Font Bureau or Hoefler, or my own
    Walburn or Worldwide. <BR> <BR>That would include experiments, varying parameters
    such as tracking, leading, line-kength, scaling and paper stock as well as font
    and size, preferably with press tests. <BR> <BR>You can also study things such
    as ascender length in some typefaces which have it as a variable &#40;Fournier?&#41;,
    or by comparing similar fonts with different x-heights, e.g. Palatino vs. Aldus;
    or Adobe Garamond vs. ITC Garamond. <BR> <BR>

  body: Herb Lubalin did not design many of the ITC faces. The large x-height was
    dictated as much by graphic design at the time as it was by Lubalin and ITC. <BR>
    <BR>Many ITC faces were developed as Display-Text. For use in large size block
    of text. Specifically for advertising and collateral work. I don&#39;t think anyone
    developing ITC faces in the 70s and 80s had any illusions of being text face designers.

  body: Some MM faces have &#34;Optical Scaling&#34; as a design axis. However, there
    is no absolute correlation between what the &#34;default&#34; instance is for
    use at a particular type size, and what will work best in a particular setting.
    <BR> <BR>While optical scaling can provide a useful starting point, it cannot
    replace the discerning eye of the typographer -- honed through education and experience,
    and exercised with a keen awareness of all the job criteria which affect readability
    &#40;paper stock, ink color, reader age, press quality, etc&#41; -- in deciding
    which instance of a typeface is best for setting at a particular size. <BR> <BR>Quite
    apart from these &#34;objective&#34; typographic criteria, there is the aesthetic
    effect the typographer is aiming to create. For instance, one may decide to use
    a 6pt instance of an optically scaled face at 12 pt, with added letterspacing,
    to create a &#34;naif&#34; tone. <BR>
