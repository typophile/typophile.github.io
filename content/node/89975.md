    same letters are different?  That\u2019s a pretty good sign it\u2019s hand done.
    When you see a \u201Cdegraded\u201D looking typeface, but every messy e looks
    exactly the same, that\u2019s a dead give away that its a font, and not natural.
    There are, however, some fonts that have alternate characters to avoid this, but
    they are few. Without having looked into it, I would hazard a guess that this
    piece is fashioned after a pre-existing script with some of their own hand-writing
    mixed in.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
