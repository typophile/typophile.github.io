  body: This /R doesn't need actually to be an alternate, it could have been edited
    (and not really hard to do). To me, the real earmark here is definitely not /R
    but /S and /C and that's why I'm pretty convinced they started from Stone Sans,
    mainly squooshing it, reworking /R counter, extending /E top bar and adding triangular
    serifs to left top of some letters.

  body: "Hi Ryuk, your analysis seems plausible. I note the Stone Sans _P_ is already
    open and looks similar to the _R_ in the image. It's easy to pick up the leg from
    the _R_ and drop it onto _P_ for minor further editing.\r\n\r\nDon "

  body: As usual, excellent observation, Don. To me, that closes the case. Custom
    based on Stone Sans ITC.

  body: "There is also <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Adobe&ffam=Ocean%20Sans%20Std%20-%20ExtraBold%20Extended&fid=a31e3cb279b25796f5d21edafd450d9b&fsize=60&text=CRUISEINN&fit=1|Ocean
    Sans (ExtraBold Extended)]]</strong> by Ong Chong Wah [Adobe, 1993] which looks
    very similar to Stone Sans.\r\nThe /R leg still needs reworking but I think the
    /S of Extra Bold Extended weight fits better to the sample.\r\n"
