  Below marks and Microsoft Office programs: they crop below marks. is this a metric
  issue? I set the Ascender and Descender values in FontLab but get same result. (see
  attached image).\r\n"

  body: The marks glyph  is set below the baseline. Open the particular glyph in any
    font editor and move it a bit upward.

  body: Soroush, you need to work with WinAscent and WinDescent. If you contact me
    offline I can send you an e-mail with a more detailed explanation.

  body: "Frode, Thanks. I try to overcome by setting WinDescent to -1500 but it increases
    line-spacing. is there another way to do without changing line spaces? \r\n\r\nwith
    very big spaces between lines:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/High_4889.jpg]"

  body: "This is indeed a metrics problem. There are a couple of ways to address it.\r\n\r\n1)
    A work around in MS Word: set linespacing to be an exact amount rather than relative
    to default spacing. This usually prevents clipping.\r\n\r\n2) Set the OS/2 Win
    values to be large enough to accomodate the marks, but leave the OS/2 Typo values
    as you would like them to be to define default linespacing. Then use a table editor
    to a) set the OS/2 table version to 4 and b) turn on fsSelection bit 7. This bit
    tells an application to use the Typo metrics for linespacing instead of the Win
    values. The caveats with this approach are that not all applications support this
    bit setting, so linespacing may be inconsistent, and MS Word does some heuristics
    to avoid clipping that sometimes override the Typo values."
