  body: It might be a cultural difference, but that looks more like a funeral invitation
    to me. Other than the names, at least. What kind of paper were you going to use?
    Maybe that could be used to cheer this up?

  body: "Is the shape set in stone? \r\n\r\nI can see the first challenge right away
    is setting the family names equally important. Is one set the parents of the bride
    and the other for the groom? Technically you could put the bride's parents on
    top of the groom's, or if it is a culture issue vice versa. \r\n\r\nI am not sure
    I'd use a dagger to symbolize the cross.\r\n\r\nThe placement of the names below
    the optical center is making it feel bottom heavy.\r\n\r\nI think the lack of
    caps at the beginning of sentences seem like a mistake as you did capitalize the
    couple's names."

  body: "Hello, and thank you for your responses.\r\n\r\nGrotEsqu\xE9:\r\nI agree,
    it does look morbid, I think the dagger had much to do with it.\r\n\r\nTiffany:\r\nI'm
    sorry, I didn't understand your question about the shape being set in stone, which
    shape?\r\n\r\nThe names of the bride's parents are on the left, the groom's on
    the right.\r\n\r\nI agree with you, the dagger is now gone.\r\n\r\nI've tried
    to correct the placement of the names.\r\n\r\nAs Spire noticed the invitation
    is one long sentence, starting with the names of the parents."

  body: I think the shapes at the top and bottom are altogether too swashy, and their
    lines are too thin. They lessen the impact of the name of the bride and groom.
    I'd try replacing them with something robust and simple, with a line weight more
    similar to the names. Perhaps a more geometric decorative shape, to provide a
    contrast. Printed in a lighter tint.

  body: "I think the ornaments come from the same family (Bickman) as the script and
    therefore I don't have a problem with them. But I think two are redundant, I'd
    eliminate the top one, move the type up, and enlarge the ornament at the bottom.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not loving the way you broke up that one line (convidam...) into three - preferred
    it as one.\r\n\r\nI'm also slightly bothered by the centering of the two families'
    names - can you nudge the pair on the right a bit to the right? The entire block
    of names, as is, looks off center to the left.\r\n\r\nBy 'set in stone' I think
    Tiffany meant is that some sort of standard wedding invitation size/shape (the
    square) or is there some flexibility about it.\r\n\r\nI'd also add more leading
    overall - both to the family names and to the text, open it up vertically a bit."

  body: More changes, incorporating some of the ideas suggested by patty. A lot will
    be added by the inks and paper, I think we'll print it in a special color, maybe
    silver, not sure about the paper yet. Right now I'm more concerned with details
    related to typography.

    \r\n\r\nI don't like borders in general. If you go with a border, search for another
    one, with a more \"lively\" charakter.\r\n\r\nI like the face ;)\r\n\r\n(sorry

  body: i agree with the border thing its very cliche of a wedidng invite , but i
    do agree with poms on the face especially the script and i am thinking the     &     character
    is very nice it would be lovley to set it at the back but in a lighter shade but
    much larger as a feature , i just feel a wedding is the celebration of two people
    joining together and it would be nice to reflect that ,lou

  body: "I think you can afford to increase the size of the swash and move the bottom
    of the border up and combine the two where they meet. If you broke the date and
    time details to three lines\r\na \u2026 2006\r\n\xE0s \u2026 Rita\r\nEstrada \u2026
    200 \r\nyou should get a better composition.\r\nFor the top half have you tried
    ranging the names left and right and closing the convidam line and both sets of
    names to counter the space filled with the swash of the ampersand and pulling
    the border down to form a rectangle in a square format which can look dramatic.\r\nTim"

  body: "I think you need to lose the border and bring all the elements closer to
    each other. Right now it feels like you are spreading things apart to fill space.
    It creates the effect of separate elements instead of a cohesive whole.\r\n\r\nIs
    the swash the same weight as Raquel & Ricardo? Their names look like the bold
    weight--though it could be the optical effect of it being set at a larger. It
    just looks overwhelmed down there."

  body: "I think the parents' names need to not be center justified. Left set, right
    justified & right set, left justified. And perhaps a little closer together, but
    definitely not any further apart than the dads' names are now.\r\nAnd I agree
    with the comment that the parts all need to be brought closer together.\r\nI don't
    think it needs to be scrapped. The example Palatine showed seems more casual (and
    quite lovely). The one Rafael is working on seems like it belongs to a more formal
    event. Neither bad, just different."

  body: "Rafael,\r\n\r\nSeveral thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. I think the \"funeral\" responses
    may have had to do with two things: the dagger and the static symmetry. The dagger
    is often used to represent the end of a text, or more symbolically, death. And
    the square bordered layout in which type is centered and spread out over the whole
    area evokes the layouts of gravestones....\r\n\r\n2. The border: these kinds of
    printed black lines that are usually coupled thick/thin like this one are devices
    used by printers to fool people into thinking that there is spatial depth to the
    page. Expensive invitations often use embossing to create multiple levels of impression
    into the page, but when someone doesn't want to spend the money on engraving embossed
    pages, they can fake it by printing 'shadow lines'....hence the overuse of borders.
    They become hackneyed and make things look cheap......\r\n\r\n3. It seems to me
    you could improve the type by clarifying when and why you use certain cases. The
    parents are in all-lowercase small caps (no larger capitals), the main message
    is in lower case, but the bride and groom are in title case (script italic), and
    the proper nouns in the last paragraph are also in title case.....\r\n\r\nWhen
    poets like e.e. cummings used lower case exclusively in their texts, they did
    it for a reason. They were eschewing established rules of grammar and punctuation
    they thought were too staid and musty. They wanted to strip all that out and focus
    purely on the content, insofar as words are capable of accurately conveying content.\r\n\r\nI'll
    stick my neck out and say that, roughly speaking:\r\nupper case = 'stately, rigid,
    engraved, permanent, chiseled'\r\ntitle case = 'formal, corporate, presentational,
    polished'\r\nmixed case = 'conversational, flowing, normal, direct'\r\nlower case
    = 'personal, intimate, humble, unassuming'\r\n\r\nIt could then be inferred that
    the use of small caps is probably a hybrid between upper and title cases.\r\n\r\nTwo
    more things: script and italic. The switch from separately formed letters to script
    indicates the sudden presence of the HAND (i.e., a calligraphic touch....personal,
    custom, elegant). And, the use of italics indicates the sudden presence of the
    VOICE (i.e. spoken conversation or a quotation, emphasis).\r\n\r\nDecide how you
    want to portray the tone of this event in the type and stick with it. Use the
    cases judiciously to support that decision. Right now, it's kind of scattershot:
    too much pepper in the chili.\r\n\r\n4. You could also get more out of the use
    of the script by using its \"swashy\" nature to connect the two names physically.
    Right now, there is a lot of space between the names and ampersand.....it looks
    a little like they're already sleeping on opposite sides of the bed! Perhaps put
    them closer together and draw some additional swashes that connect all three elements
    with a flourish...? This might also help the ornament at the bottom to not seem
    so merely decorative and gratuitous, but rather an echo of what's happening above.\r\n\r\nCheers
    and Good Luck with it! And remember that people are going to be delighted to receive
    the message if it's good news to them, no matter how you set it."

    not celebrate it in a pub with beer and friends? So, it also needs to be authoritative
