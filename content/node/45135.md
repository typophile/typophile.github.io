body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI once had this crazy plan of assembling an international, all-star
  typejam band that would perform on TypeCon. As it turns out this could very well
  happen in Buffalo. That's why I'd need as soon as possible a complete list of people
  attending this year's TypeCon who play (a) musical instrument(s).\r\n\r\nCould you
  please send me an e-maill with:\r\n\r\n(a) your name\r\n(b) which instrument(s)
  you master\r\n(c) which is your preferred style of music (for playing, might be
  different from what music you like to listen to!)\r\n(d) your proficiency for each
  instrument, ranging from promising amateur over semi-professional to seasoned pro
  (I'm really sorry, but beginners can't apply)\r\n(e) if you have experience with
  playing in bands (very important!)\r\n\r\nWe will try to cook up a set list, which
  every musician will have to rehearse autonomously. Please keep in mind this will
  be an experiment, so I really don't know where this will end.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone
  for your co-operation."

    was a  jazz drummer and Jim Rimmer played a mean coronet. \r\nThe House (house)
    band and [[http://www.fontshop.de/typo2007/index.php/Wolfraam;89/3|Wolfraam]]
    performed at [[http://www.fontshop.de/typo2007/index.php/1/3|TypoBerlin]] last
    year.\r\nIs there a connection between music & type? A similar predisposition?\r\n"

    use a guitar. ;^)

  body: "I'm a musician, but pretty far out of the mainstream. I play traditional
    Irish music (jigs, reels and such) on wooden flute and pennywhistle. I'm good
    at it, but outside of that arena I don't do much. Thought I'd mention it anyway.\r\n\r\nI
    would imagine there are lots of type designers that are also musicians. Seems
    natural to me. Get yourself a singer and maybe guitar or keyboards and you'll
    be in business. Myself, I'll probably just keep playing to the 4 walls or maybe
    look for an Irish session in buffalo.\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\nStephen Rapp\r\n"

    Sudweeks\r\nVocals\r\nRock and Roll, Funk\r\nPro\r\nYes, I have experience practicing
    and performing with bands.\r\nI write too. My preferred method is to fit lyrics
    up to songs with in-progress instrumentals; sometimes I start from vocal melody.
    Since it's a one-time gig I get the feeling that we might end up moving in the
    direction of parodied pop covers. I hope not, but if so my voice is still all
    yours."
