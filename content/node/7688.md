    &#34;primitive&#34; starting shape? <BR> <BR>The point of this of course is to
    see how designers &#34;regularize&#34; shapes. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Maybe people didn&#39;t respond because they didn&#39;t think anything useful
    could be determined by the exercise, or because they thought you had pre-determined
    that designers would regularise the shape. I also suspect that most designers
    associate fixing something or making something correct relative to a brief, so
    presenting them with a shape without any context of what it is for isn&#39;t likely
    to garner a response. The trick would be to come up with a context that would
    not overly determine how the designer would respond, but that seems to me very
    difficult.

  body: Sure it could turn out to be a pointless waste, but let&#39;s have some faith
    in experimentation, come on. And although I doubt much could be &#34;determined&#34;,
    it might very well get quite interesting, no? <BR> <BR>&#62; they thought you
    had pre-determined that <BR>&#62; designers would regularise the shape. <BR> <BR>Actually
    I had this idea that somebody might just re-post what I showed, in effect saying
    &#34;it&#39;s fine as it is&#34;! <BR> <BR>I tried to be as non-guiding as possible.
    This is why I avoided a &#34;brief&#34; &#40;normally very relevant, I agree&#41;
    and why I didn&#39;t give actual ouline data &#40;too &#34;explicit&#34;&#41;.

    welcome! <BR> <BR>hhp

    about this, but I want to think about it for a while. <BR> <BR>The left image
    I redrew, the righthand one was a mirrored and merged duplicate of an auto-traced
