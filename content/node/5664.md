body: My freelance identity needs to be updated. I&#39;ve been wondering if I should
  continue using my name or should I create a business name &#40;would it seem more
  professional/substantial or just gimicky&#41;? For now, I have decided I would prefer
  to go with my name. I know it&#39;s a very personal decision, but I&#39;m curious
  as to the process others have used to come up with their name, is it ok to use a
  private joke? Does it have to be something the client &#34;gets&#34;? Many of the
  other posts have debated over whether or not an individual should have a personal
  logo. I feel that as a graphic designer the answer is yes. Attached are 2 business
  card designs, please let me know what you think, if you have a preference, and how
  you think they can be improved upon. Thanks in advance, I value all of your input.  <BR>

  body: I think if you are a solo, freelance designer, then you should definately
    stick with your name. Having a company name for an individual just doesn&#39;t
    seem necessary. Plus, if you work with someone and they like you, it&#39;s probably
    easier for them just to remember your name.

  body: 'I agreed with BGG, you can use your name as an identity.  <BR> <BR>A point
    of view : The challenge would be to associate your name at the graphic design
    sector at the beginning. This  is directly in relation with the high quality of
    your work. You do a good job, your name will be synonym of quality. If not, the
    opposite effect could happen.  <BR> <BR>The design, the type and the pastel color
    you&#39;ve choose, horizontal or vertical, seem to me in relation with cosmetic
    sector.  <BR> <BR>I like what you&#39;ve done with the ligature of st <BR>Finally,
    why do you use a lc or the first i and UP for the second i. I also suggest you
    work on the kerning of Navin, looks too tight.'

  body: Kirsten loose the dot on the lower case i in your first name, its almost crashing
    with the K. I like the horizontal card. The colors are very Gold Coast Connecticut.

  body: i like the logo typography and the ligature. <BR>i wonder if the thin line
    under Navin is necessary. the overall colour is quite tepid. if i were you i&#39;d
    add a strong colour along.

  body: Colors are pleasant. Very good if clients are in health care, hospitality
    and/or female. I do not see this design/colors scheme as a gateway to high tech,
    industrial or for that matter most male clients. As a freelance designer I think
    going with your own name is fine, especially if it already has a good reputation.
    <BR>It is important that the name is remembered. I know a designer whos real last
    name is Radboy- He is young like a boy and his design is &#34;radical&#34;-using
    his own name works great.
