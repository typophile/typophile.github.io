  project I\u2019m currently raising fund for. Its concept is loosely spun around
  the design concept for \xBBAntithesis\xAB, my master\u2019s degree typeface from
  Type]Media in The Hague, 2011|http://typemedia2011.com.\r\n\r\nThe project has developed
  into an interdisciplinary art story.\r\nI\u2019m about to make a ten minute dance
  film, in 3D, the concept of which, like Antithesis, revolves around the tension
  between three unequal poles.\r\n\r\nThe perks for the film involve a deal particularly
  aimed at graphic designers and typophiles: Donation starting at $75 will receive
  the typeface itself. I\u2019m in the process of finishing a professional version
  of the typeface and expect to send it out to donators beginning of March.\r\n\r\nPlease
  help in making this fascinating project come true.\r\nLinks:\r\nCrowd funding campaign
