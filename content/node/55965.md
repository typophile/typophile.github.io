body: "Does anyone know of any software that allows you to put all your fonts in one
  central folder that can be accessed by an entire network. I work in an office where
  there are 6 artist computers and each computer is accessing fonts from its own folder
  in the control panel, but the problem is that if one artist installs a new font
  and then another artist picks up the artwork containing that font it doesnt show
  up and we have to go through annoying shit to then get the font on all the computers.\r\n\r\nI
  need some way of putting all the fonts for all the computers in one central folder
  or area that can be accessed via the network.\r\n"
