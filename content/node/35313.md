  Switzerland and ending at Copenhagen) end of this year and would like to find out
  if there's any typography related place I could visit or explore.\r\nI found a letterpress
  workshop (Holzlettern Manufacture Hamburg (Wood Type History and Future) which is
  at Saarlandstrasse 13, 22303 Hamburg Germany , but could get any infomation at the
  website (holzlettern-manufaktur.de).\r\n\r\nActually, I would be thrilled if I could
  visit a letterpress shop. Anything goes, please advice!\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nJake,"

    and printmaking workshop in a separate building across from the main one. On some
    days, good activities happen there.\r\n\r\nWhen are you coming? I've been living
    in Germany for years, but I will be moving the UK at the end of September.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The R\xF6misch-Germanisches Museum in Cologne is also great. They have a
    lot of Roman stonecarved inscriptions. A lot! The museum is right next to the
    cathedral, which is also worth visiting, and like most churches, it is also free
    (which the museum is not). The chapels around the cathedral's choir-end have a
    lot of nice lettering in them, too, if you look carefully. Like <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/typeoff/286118310/in/set-72157594356209828/\">here</a>."
