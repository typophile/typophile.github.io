  and sometime of those the stroke doesn't go all the way through the S shape instead
  simply projects from top of the S shape and from the bottom of the S shape.\r\n\r\nBut
  almost all old school typewriting machines have a double vertical stroke.\r\n\r\nMost
  advertizements featuring price in dollars use a single vertical stroke. But, throughout
  the Hip Hop culture the double vertical stroke is most common.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=hip+hop+dollar+sign+pendant&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&bpcl=37189454&biw=1269&bih=875&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=msKSUKqVCcqd2QWhyYGgAg\r\n\r\nSo
  what gives? Which one is 'proper'?\r\n\r\nFYI, from Wiki...\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The
  best documented explanation reveals that the sign evolved out of the Spanish and
  Spanish American scribal abbreviation \"ps\" for pesos. A study of late eighteenth-
  and early nineteenth-century manuscripts shows that the s gradually came to be written
  over the p developing a close equivalent to the \"$\" mark</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There
  is a theory that the dollar sign goes back to the most important Roman coin, the
  sestertius, which had the letters 'HS' as its currency sign. When superimposed these
  letters form a dollar sign with two vertical strokes (the horizontal line of the
  'H' merging into the 'S'). </blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\nn.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Nick!\r\n\r\nI got a commish to design a huge backdrop for a Hip Hop
    artist's photo shoot, a major element of which is a ten foot tall hand drawn dollar
    sign. I designed the dollar sign with double vertical strokes because because
    compositionally  speaking I think the double vertical stroke has more tension
    reacting with the S shape of the dollar sign ...and bonus as it turns out that
    that form of dollar sign is by far the most common throughout the Hip Hop and
    Rap community. \r\n\r\nSo that would be nu skool youts using old school representation
    as a means of modern communication evolution.\r\n\r\nn.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The hip hop fantasy of wealth is very rococo; more is more. It stands to
    reason that it would reject the form of the symbol with fewer lines as not fancy
    enough.\r\n\r\nAdvertisements may be the flip side of that. They'll use every
    trick possible to make something seem like a better deal; they may have hit upon
    the idea that a simpler dollar sign psychologically looks cheaper."
