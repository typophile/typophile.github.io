<p>Linked in certainly looks more serious, but is it really useful for professional networking? Is it just another Facebook but with a resume attached?</p>
<p>Facebook, I don&rsquo;t think I quite get the point of. Yeah, OK it can be fun, and I can find out about events I&rsquo;m interested in but I could find out about them as easily bay different means. It seems to mainly be a vehicle for delivering movie quizzes. Is it fair to compare the two?</p>

<p>Only if you want it to be. Facebook is really quite flexible — and it&rsquo;s simple too. I think it&rsquo;s currently the best way for most people to create a web page about themselves and to find others.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really say much for Linkedin. I&rsquo;m on it, but I&rsquo;ve only visited the site to accept connection requests. It is certainly more oriented towards job seeking and business relationships.</p>

<p>Facebook - I dunno - it is a LOT of fun but I can&rsquo;t see that any of it is professional. I play Scrabulous, superpoke my friends, get told that I look like a cat, figure out all the places in the world I&rsquo;ve been,  and match up words to protect the rainforest. Excellent way to waste time!</p>
<p>LinkedIn ramped up first among my crew - both professional and personal connections. But Facebook is the Obama of the two - it surged out of nowhere and now it seems more people I know are on that. Probably just to play quizzes and conquer the world though.</p>
<p>My brother (who is in the tech world) tells me people he know use Facebook for their primary email nowadays because there is no spam. I wouldn&rsquo;t do that because I can&rsquo;t see any way to organize the InBox.</p>
<p>Put another way - I&rsquo;m on Facebook all the time. Linked In I look at maybe once a week.</p>

That&rsquo;s one of the banes of it I think&mdash;many times people ask to connect with me and I decline it. Sure, we know each other, but cant vouch for experience working together at all. It&rsquo;s a great site overall, it proves invaluable for business networking for myself and many people I know. Because it a business network, you wouldnt add your mom to it.</p>
<p>FaceBook is a social network of Friends to connect and interact with. It&rsquo;s more robust in the way of interacting with your connections, with games and messaging etc. Unlike LinkedIn, becasue its a friend network, you WOULD add your mom to this.</p>

<p>How has LinkedIn proved invaluable exactly? I mean for me it&rsquo;s been fun to find a few old friends/colleagues on there, but I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s led to anything I couldn&rsquo;t have accomplished the old fashioned way, just by reaching out. I don&rsquo;t see a lot of activity going on beyond racking up the connections. I suppose if you don&rsquo;t have your own web site (as I do) it might be a handy place to post your resume but has it led to job opportunities for you?</p>
<p>My mom and I in fact have worked together - on 4 books! So I actually would add her to LinkedIn if only she was into that sort of thing.</p>
