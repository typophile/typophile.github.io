  for know further info about this font. I remember to have seen it printed in old
  Mecanorma or Letraset catalogs when I was studying at university in 1993.\r\n\r\nAbout
  14 Ca\xF1onazos, is a Colombian tropical music compiled series that every year on
  December publishes a selection of 14 successful songs of tropical genre for parties
  or fiestas of finish year.\r\n\r\nMore info, http://www.discosfuentesedimusica.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=146&Itemid=126\r\n\r\nThank

  body: In the upper case letters the two Os, the two As and the two Ns look different,
    even aside from the explosive effect. (Of course, the Ns are really different
    characters.) This may be some hand lettering.

  body: "Careless! I should have noticed the letter variations that indicated this
    was hand lettering.\r\nBut it could be fonted by making several variations of
    the little eruptions and pasting them at different angles on a suitable base font.
    Unfortunately my search for something similar to  CANONAZOS was not very productive.
    As an experiment I blended Neuland Black with Showcard Gothic 50-50 and got the
    following result, which could be edited to make a fairly close match:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BlendNeulandBlackShowcardGothic_5080.jpg]\r\nBut
    does anyone know of an existing font that is closer?\r\nDon"

    a new image of Ca\xF1onazos, first \xF1 haves a tilde (in Spanish \xF1 is different
    of n), I think that this font is based on Neuland but I don't have more info about
    it yet. This is not a drawn or hand lettering. Notice similar glyphs in upper
    and lowercase.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Useful. This separates the base letters from the eruptions. Now the N and
    A base letters look the same. But the base O's are still different. Might be the
    same if they were flipped vertically.\r\nFont or not?\r\nDon"

  body: "You're welcome Vargas. \r\nYes Fontlab.  Make certain that you have opened
    the two fonts you want to blend. If you want to blend the upper case make certain
    that the capital height is comparable in the two fonts. I usually re-size the
    fonts based on setting the letter O at a height of 700. If you want to change
    the appearance of one of the fonts before blending, e.g. narrowing the width,
    do this. Then use the pull down tab for Tools and choose Blend Fonts. For significantly
    dis-similar fonts like Neuland Black and El Grande it's probably best to uncheck
    the box for \"Do not change type or add nodes in compatible outlines.\" For significantly
    dis-similar fonts you can expect to do some cleanup after blending to get rid
    of unwanted bulges etc. Somewhat of a learning curve to get the results you want.
    Best to try 50-50 blend amount before experimenting. It should not be too difficult
    to more or less replicate the results I posted. \r\nDon\r\nRevised"
