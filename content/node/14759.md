  is of the opinion that there <em>must</em> be, given the existence of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang\">interrobang</a>.
  Heh.)"

    the rather weak "Bleepmarks" in the hopes of getting some better suggestions...

  body: "I bet it was developed as a device in comics and may not have been typographic
    originally, but instead used skull-and-crossbones, stars, etc. The visual nature
    of the practice just doesn't seem to fit historically with typographic practice.\r\n\r\nThis
    is all guesswork on my part, of course."

    Blurgits, plewds, maledicta and speed lines: Just a few of the terms that define
    the stuff you see in comic books all the time. \r\n\r\nEverything has a name --
    the left arm of chair has a different name than the right side of a chair, to
    a carpenter. And to comic-book people, the various things we do, use and see have
    names.\r\n\r\nMaledicta: It's Latin for roughly, \"bad words.\" It refers to *^%&$#@!!
    Every time Sarge Snorkel uses symbology for \"bad words,\" it's maledicta. Not
    the same as Sgt. Fury, who uses substitute words -- \"Lantern-jawed, gold-brickin',
    pink-eyed son of a bob-tailed hyena\" isn't maledicta. That's \"euphemism.\" Maledicta
    is lightning bolts, death's-heads, and crapola from the top line of the keyboard
    to indicate bad words. Bad words: maledicta. (Mal=bad, as in malfeasance. Dicta,
    as in words, as in dictionary.)\r\n\r\nPlewds: Great big sweat beads that leap
    off a character's head to show anxiety. Outside of Beetle Bailey, it's not done
    much any more in American comics (which invented them). But you see it in manga
    times 10. It happens on Teen Titans on Cartoon Network every week. Those big ol'
    sweat beads that jump off someone's head to indicate to the viewer an emotional
    state are PLEWDS.\r\n\r\nBlurgits: Repetitive motion indicated by drawings that
    shows arms or legs seeming to be in several places at once in phantom fashion.
    See: The Flash. Related to speed lines.\r\n\r\nSpeed lines: Awwww, you know what
    they are. I[d say the Japanese had made a science of them, except that Carmine
    Infantino beat them to it.\""

    hit the Halfbakery page during my first search, but all I saw was the proposal
    for a standard and then I got distracted and never read the rest of the page.
    Egg-on-face.)"

    seem to be used to specifically relate to one type of graphic treatment. See http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=2122
