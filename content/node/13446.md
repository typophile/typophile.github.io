body: "hello\r\n\r\nim very interested in pictogramms (symbols, icons), especially
  in their function as a substitute for typed words. i made an invitation for a party
  once for my brother when he moved in his new appartment. you can see it <a href=\"http://www.art.ificial.ch/jobs/wg.gif\"
  target=\"_blank\">here</a> (the top part is the front, the bottom part the back
  of the postcard - dont look at the typetreatment, its not too good). its simple,
  it was a rush job - but it shows what i mean.\r\n\r\nhow do symbols evolve, and
  how do we perceive symbols? how does this \"convention\" on what symbols are internationaly
  understood (like the sportsymbols once made for the olympics) change or does it
  even exist?\r\n\r\nim just interested in a discussion about symbols and how they
  can replace written language sometimes, making things easier (navigation in a museum,
  driving in a car, getting an overview over a lot of different categories/subjects
  - the olympic sport symbols - etc. etc."

  body: Every day I deal with two symbols that if not respected could cause me major
    harm, one is a red hand and the other is a silhouette of a person striding. Being
    that our avenues have 7 lanes and five that are actively used by agressive motorists
    I respect these symbols for what they mean. They replaced the "Walk" "Don't Walk"
    word signs.

    and Symbols: Their Design and Meaning</a>\r\n\r\n\"Universally recognized signs
    and symbols have always been important means of communication. But why are certain
    primary shapes and configurations of dot and line perceived and remembered more
    easily than others? In this fascinating and now-classic study, the world-renowned
    typographer and designer Adrian Frutiger explores the development of signs and
    symbols in general and writing in particular, relating basic graphic principles
    and components to a wide range of historical, linguistic, and practical concerns.
    The author embraces everything from Egyptian hieroglyphics to modern company logos
    in his intriguing analysis of the way humans have always tried to express thought
    through graphic means.\""

  body: "The old saw, \"a picture is worth a thousand (or ten thousand) words\" neglects
    a very important detail when it is applied to pictograms: the picture really needs
    to be unambiguous about exactly what it depicts. Otherwise, it's not even worth
    the single word or idea it is meant to convey.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some
    symbols gain currency through extensive use, even if their meaning is not conveyed
    visually. The universal \"No Entry\" sign, a horizontal bar in a circle, doesn't
    really say much on its own, but over time most folks understand what it means.
    And I have yet to encounter a sign that says clearly and unequivocally \"Ausgang/Ausfahrt,
    exit, salida, sortie,uitgang, uscita or way out (my favorite).\""

  body: "Hmmm, this is an interestering topic and one that I recently dabbled a bit
    in when I was working on my Thesis project for the Master's Communication Design
    program at Pratt here in N.Y. My thesis project was redesigning the New York City
    subway wayfinding system.\r\n\r\nWhile I went as far as creating a new typeface,
    and redesigning (and rewording) the signage, I also wanted to experiment in creating
    a custom pictogram system similar to those used in Olympic systems. Given the
    scope, I bit off more than I could chew. While I have completed my Master's degree,
    it is definitely a project that I continue to work on on my own time.\r\n\r\nNick
    brings up some good points as one of the tasks that I found difficult to achieve
    was figuring out a pictogram for the term \"exit\". A word that shows its ugly
    head in multiple languages in every wayfinding system. Why can't we figure out
    an image to express that concept?"

    clearly point the way out in case of fire. When I noted the lack of clearly-understandable
    exit pictograms, I had in mind something that suggested a more orderly egress.
    And the British \"Way Out\" is still my favorite exit sign."

  body: I agree Nick... "Way Out" is indeed awesome. I also agree with you on the
    no exit pictogram (I edited the earlier post as I cited William). Norbert, the
    signs you show are also regionally sepcific. For example, in the US, no fire exits
    are ever shown in green. Here only red is used.

    the tent (no ren-entry without a ticket). And, it took me a moment to consider

    in symbols lie in their use as navigation systems in 3d-space (museums, big parties,

    such a way-finding-system for a pretty big party friends are organising (~4000
