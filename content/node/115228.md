  body: "Goz, is this a book which is mostly text? And if so, are you committed to
    using a sans serif font? Or is it a book with a little bit of text and pictures
    of rockets?\r\nAre you looking for something modern and up-to-date or something
    serious and official or something adventurous or something technical or something
    easy to read? Aside from \"space\" I'm not really getting a direction here. I'm
    not really sure what the \"contemporary\" reference in the title of the post means?
    Who is the target audience?"

    a book I'm designing for a college project, target audience is kids aged 10 -15

    looking for advice (thats not a generic typeface) to use as a display type to
    accompany the body copy that is currently \"Gotham Rounded light\""
