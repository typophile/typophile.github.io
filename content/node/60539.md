body: "I'm creating a font that was initially really messy since it was created with
  a calligraphy brush (my typography professor is going to kill me for creating this
  \"messy\" font, hah!)\r\n\r\nwell' Ive since vectorized them and started to bring
  them into fontlab. however, for some reason it's showing this strange outline on
  the inside when I open up font book or preview it.  When I type using the font,
  it doesn't show this. here are some screen shots:\r\n\r\nhttp://localhostr.com/files/452fd2/Picture+1.png\r\nshows
  the weird glitch, they are really small white spots, they look very unattractive.
  \r\n\r\nhttp://localhostr.com/files/b16da7/Picture+2.png\r\nthe selected, you can
  clearly see there are no points on the inside\r\n\r\nI'm assuming it has to do with
  the messyness of it, but on install this would look every unappealing, any ideas?"

  body: "I *seem* to have found the problem.\r\n\r\nIt seems that once an area gets
    below a certain size it sums up the data, so if you have a thin area it create
    these kind of white areas. I want to keep it detailed but avoid this, is there
    anyway to do this?"

    you tried the \"merge contour\" command?"

    someone else in this forum give a better suggestion after this."

  body: no luck. now I've got even a more annoying problem. I can install the font,
    it shows and I can preview it even, but I cant type with it, it will just skip
    it and go to next font :(

  body: "Computers are not magic faeries who can sprinkle dust on a complicated drawing
    and convert it into a working outline font. Getting this font right is going to
    take a LOT of work. Optimize the outlines as a font-wide action (you\u2019ll have
    to use trial-and-error to get the settings right) and then you\u2019ll have to
    spend a few days (seriously, this can take days) checking and tweaking <em>all</em>
    of the outlines to fix curves that warp in on themselves, doubled points, bad
    inflections, curves that go the wrong way, etc.. If this is a school project and
    you have a really tight schedule it might even be worth starting over with something
    simple."

  body: "I know there is no magic button, I wouldn't expect there to be. I spent about
    15min on each letter doing them by hand with kanji brush with about 30-40 tries
    per letter, I wouldnt have done that had I thought it was going to be easy :)\r\n\r\npoint
    I guess is the font itself looks great, its the preview and when installed that
    it looks like poo. when it's installed and you use it, it looks fantastic and
    I'm very happy with it."

    buggy tool, fair enough, but it should not be blamed for everything. What do you
    mean <em>you can clearly see there are no points on the inside</em>? I can see
    points all around the white shape: you clearly have a path with an opposite direction
    inside. Look again and reconsider.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nop_3597.png]"

  body: "oh, yeah you're right, I stand corrected. I was referring to the right hand
    side more so though, it makes it look like there are those gaps inside the letter
    form when they are still part of the edge. I think this has to do with the anti-aliasing
    in preview for performance purposes maybe?\r\n\r\nI would clean these how, however
    they are what make the font look convincing in my opinion.  It's only preview
    that they turn out bad, when you use them in any program they look great, which
    is what makes me think its the anti-aliasing. \r\n\r\nI thought there was a font
    preview function or something that would aid it in displaying for preview or smaller
    sizes."
