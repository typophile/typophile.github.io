  type specimen from the beginning of sec. XX. \r\nI'm pretty sure it should be from
  some German, French or English foundry at least by the end of the 19th Century.\r\nDoes
  anyone know this?\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_thumbnail/public/font-id/img2.jpg?itok=6tOYE-zt"
