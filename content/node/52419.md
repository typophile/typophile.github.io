  body: "It wasn't familiar to me either, and I tried WTF on it with no luck. It reminds
    me slightly of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/amsterdam-old-style-rr/|Amsterdam
    Old Style]] from Red Rooster, and of course [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/algerian/|Algerian]],
    but it  is clearly a different design.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "This font is [[http://es.letrag.com/tipografia.php?id=93|\"Gallaecia Castelao\"]],
    and it is a digitalized version of a classic galician typeface which can be seen
    engraved in stone castles, churches or tombstones.\r\nThis font was distributed
    for free along with the galician newspaper \"La Voz de Galicia\", but now, I think
    you can get it sending an email to the designer Carlos Nu\xF1ez, from the studio
    [[http://www.variografik.com/|\"Variografik\"]].\r\nThere are some more free fonts
    like this, like [[http://www.dafont.com/gallaecia.font|\"Gallaecia\"]], but I
    recommend you the first one, as it is the most similar to the original engraved
    forms."
