  using the heaviest weight. (Serifa 75 Black)\r\nI really like the typeface, but
  unfortunately I have a client that's hung up on \"the heavy handed serifs\"\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions on a typeface that I could use instead?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    for something really different, you might take a look a Breughel...\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/breughel/"

    another slab (any heavy slab will have heavy serifs) or a heavy typeface from
    another category?"
