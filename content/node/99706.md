body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm having a little problem with kerning in fontlab and I hope
  some of you may shed some light on this...\r\n\r\nWhile kerning character pairs
  in Fontlab I noticed that some pairs where not kerning at all, with this I mean
  that while everything looked ok in FL, in InDesign the pair looked without kerning.
  To test this I gave some bizarre kerning values to the problem pairs, something
  like +900, and yes, no kerning was being applied in InDesign.\r\n\r\nFiddling around
  I noticed that the problem characters would change only if one of its members was
  defined in a kerning class. Right now I'm working in Individual Pair Kerning mode
  so I'm a bit confused, because I assumed this means kerning classes are not taken
  into account.\r\n\r\nI'm wasting a lot of time with kerning, and what I discovered
  means that maybe lots of pairs are without effective kerning being applied... so,
  any recommendations about how to proceed from now on? What should I do to fix my
  kerning problems? Please somebody explain to me the right way of kerning, using
  classes and exceptions and so on.\r\n\r\nThanks"
