body: Im working on some designs for a club night. One of my Ideas involved an 80's
  style Michael Jackson 'Thriller' album type font, the kind of text the was quite
  prominent in the 80's, with a slant on the text - almost hand written, often with
  a colour gradient and black out line. Does any one know of a font that would match
  this criteria? Any suggestions would be very welcome, Thanks alot.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thriller2_4304.jpg]

  body: "Well, first off, I believe that was hand-written and probably my MJ himself.\r\n\r\nSecondly,
    I'm not familiar with this style you're talking about, unless you're referring
    to graffiti style which was very promonient in the 80's rise of hip-hop and rap.
    \r\n\r\nIf you're just looking for a hand-written looking script, check out The
    Bluemlein\r\nScript Collection at http://www.sudtipos.com/home I'm sure you'll
    find a suitable script there."
