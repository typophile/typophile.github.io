  and am looking for a typeface that is, wait for it...\r\n\r\n...modern & British!
  I thought it would be daft to showcase a foreign typeface for this topic.\r\n\r\nThere
  is no budget in the project to commision a new face unfortunately. I am looking
  for something with a distinctive character.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can enlighten me on
  any contemporary, quality, typefaces or foundrys then I would greatly appreciate
  it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nR."

  body: Priory is really nice, I've never seen that before, very distinctive, especially
    the Alt option.

  body: Neo Sans is a bit rubbishy for my taste. The 'g' is naff. I read that Jonathan
    Hoeffler and Tobias Frere Jones both have English mums so why not use something
    of theirs? That new Gotham Rounded is lovely. Or do you mean Modern rather than
    modern and you're looking for a classic from the 19th century?

  body: "Yeah well NigellaL ones mans sh*t is another man's sugar, life would be so
    mundane without variety. I love Neo Sans, especially it's light face,  and happen
    to really like the 'g'.\r\n\r\nI'll clarify though what I meant. I want my design
    to feature a typeface designed by someone who themselves originated in the UK,
    it doesn't matter if they have worked abroad. Or even a British foundry.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not saying this 'rule' is set in stone, in fact I don't want to set any rules
    for myself I suppose. It's just that the Identity is for something that showcases
    the cream of British design, and I want the typeface used within the ID to reflect
    this.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you'll agree this makes sense.\r\n\r\nThank you so much
    everyone for your input into my problem, I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nR."
