  body: "I use this fail-safe method (similar to above, but with better results):\r\n\r\nEnter
    on Google:\r\n\r\n<strong>site:typophile.com/node/</strong> <em>search term(s)
    here</em>\r\n\r\nThis eliminates Google results containing the annoying combination
    of actual threads and outdated indexed forum pages that no longer have the search
    terms on the results page. Just threads of relevant content. Mmm."

    one of our key team members now on paternity leave we're not making promises on
    launch dates. Thanks for your patience.

  body: And if anyone is interested, I just created a new command on YubNub to search
    Typophile using the revamped search engine. All you have to do is go to <a href=http://yubnub.org/>YubNub.org</a>
    and type in "tphile" and then whatever you want to search for (make sure you use
    quotes for any phrases). YubNub is extremely useful when you <a href=http://yubnub.org/documentation/describe_installation>install
    it in your search or address bar</a>, so I can now search Typophile quickly from
    any browser window. Other useful typographic search commands include <a href=http://yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=myfonts>myfonts</a>,
    <a href=http://yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=fontshop>fontshop</a>, <a href=http://yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=fontshopadv>fontshopadv</a>,
    <a href=http://yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=veertype>veertype</a>, and <a href=http://yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=adobe>adobe</a>.
