  This is a general term denominating any optical deviation from the main text (which
  might be typeset in \"regular\"), hence \"Auszeichnung\" can be e.g. bold, italics,
  small caps, etc. Thanks a lot.\r\n"

    \"Text mit Auszeichnung\"\r\n\r\nText with accent isn't right, because typefaces
    have accents in them as well. I don't like highlight either. Does anyone have
    any ideas?"

  body: "Hi Tina\r\n\r\nHmmm. Commonsense tells me the terms 'variation', 'stress'
    or 'emphasis' might work, because that's the syntactical function of the bold,
    italics, small caps, etc. that you mention.\r\n\r\nWeirdly, the online translation
    engine Babelfish translates this term as 'honour' (or 'honor' for some of us);
    which would point to Auszeichnung having a meaning within typographic hierarchy,
    like an 'elevated position', which in turn could translate as 'heading' or subheading'.
    But maybe Auszeichnung also applies to elements lower in the hierarchy, like footnotes
    and references?\r\n\r\nI'm sure it'll only be minutes before a fluently bilingual
    typesetter offers a far better and more exacting translation, but I thought I'd
    have a go..."

  body: "It's actually quite simple: a person can <em>sich auszeichnen</em> (the verb)
    in something, i.e. excel in something, be outstanding.\r\n\r\nIn typography, a
    text can be <em>ausgezeichnet</em> (the adjective), which simply means it stands
    out from the rest of the text. In that sense, <em>Auszeichnung</em> could be translated
    as distinction, or differentation. To preserve the ambiguity in \"Text mit Auszeichnung\",
    one could translate \"Text with distinction\". \"Choice of the appropriate <em>Auszeichnungen</em>
    for a given text\" could become \"Choice of the appropriate differentations/distinguishing
    features\".\r\n\r\nThe chapter devoted to <em>auszeichnen</em> in the German typography
    bible <a href=\"http://www.typografie.de/verlagsverzeichnis/typografie/652-5.html\">Lesetypografie</a>
    (pp. 120\u2013173) not only considers distinguishing one or two words from the
    main text, indeed, through italics, bold, small caps, or a different typeface
    altogether (\"character styles\" in InDesignish), but also of whole blocks of
    text (e.g., block citations), for instance through another font size, indentation,
    change of colour (\"paragraph styles\") &c.\r\n\r\n<em>Note: I started typing

  body: "Indeed, \"Auszeichnung\" in general sense means \"honors\" and \"ausgezeichnet\"
    means \"excellent\". But the typographic meaning has its own peculiarity. \r\n\r\nThese
    days, \"Auszeichnung\" in German typography is used in two meanings: \"emphasis\"
    or \"styling\". The latter translation gives a better sense of the practical use
    of the term. \"Auszeichnung\" in German typography does not really mean visual
    *emphasis* as in using bold, but all sorts of deviation from the regular. Therefore,
    I'd use the term \"styling\", as in \"styled text\", \"use various forms of styling\",
    \"applying styling to the text\". If you're confident that the intended meaning
    is about really adding emphasis to the text, use \"emphasis\". \r\n"
