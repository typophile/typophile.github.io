  body: Typophile has become really slow and unreliable as of late - tried Firefox,Chrome
    and Safari - it is slow to load on all three and sometimes I get error message
    saying Typophile is off-line - I would think Punchcut would do better since they
    are a web ourfit. Not ready to give up yet but Typophile is failing

    but it is not meant as a Typophile replacement, since it has a much narrower focus
    with restrictions concerning content and things like user names. Typedia could
    have become a vivid typography forum but they closed the forum in 2011. All other
    typography forums I know of are just sub-forums of design forums. No other (English)
    site has a similar focus as Typophile.\r\nBased on my experience with running
    a vivid German typography forum since 2001, I plan to set up an English copy early
    2014. It will be a full-fledged community site with all the bells and whistles
    one would expect from such a site nowadays. So there is hope. :-) \r\n\r\nStill,
    I am also hoping that all the Typophile discussions will someday be \u201Cfreed\u201D
    from the current software and moved somewhere where they can at least be browsed
    without problems as an archive. "

    Unavailable\" and various other spurious server error messages - all to no avail.
    Not even the courtesy to respond. \r\n\r\nI am more than willing to contribute
    to the Typophile forums - if only the server didn't pull the plug on me after
    a couple of minutes. It has got so bad that the server has been not accepting
    my password at log in and when I request another the system just freezes, or I
    get multiple reset links in my inbox. Aaaarrrrrggggggh! from a very annoyed occasional
    (when it lets me in) user.\r\n\r\nThis service is frankly outrageous and laying
    the blame on the \"Chinese Hackers\" has gone way past a joke. Yeah -right. Please
    fix it or put it out of it's misery!\r\n\r\nP.S. Just so you realise that I do
    know what I'm talking about regarding support, let me state:- In association with
    my business partner (cyclone systems.co.uk) we supply internet web hosting services
    via our www.cylonet.com site with guaranteed 24x7x365 server support service included.
