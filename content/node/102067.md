body: "Hello typhofiles,\r\nI am a graphic design student that could use some help.
  At the moment I am working on an assignment where I am to create a visual identity
  for a design hotel which has swedish furniture design as it's theme. It should reflect
  both the contemporary design and the design history.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of swedish
  furniture design I think of functionalism, rational design, clean and stylistically
  pure furniture. I immediately thought of Futura for the typography, and therefore
  chose the classic combination Futura and Bodoni.\r\n\r\nMy teacher however had this
  to say about my choices: Excepted+safe=boring. He told me to explore the world of
  typography and come up with something that feels more modern.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  on where to start looking? Any hands-on suggestions on which fonts to try? Any help
  is appreciated. Thanks!"

  body: Remember that typography is much more than choosing a typeface.  How you use
    it is of vital importance.  Learning how to use it is not a five minute task,
    either. Search for contemporary typography which has a modern edge that suits
    the furniture.  Mostly, look at he shapes of the furniture.  What typefaces work
    best with those shapes?

    For one thing, Bodoni is the defining face of the <em>modern</em> genre and Futura
    is the \u2026 \u201Cfuture\u201D :) \r\n\r\nMore importantly, a great typeface
    doesn\u2019t stop being great just because it\u2019s (relatively) old. "

    could be throwing things off, especially if we don't know if he meant to capitalize
    it or not. :-)  It's a supremely over-loaded term. In Spain for example \"el modernismo\"
    refers to things like Gaud\xED's crazy-amazing stuff! I have a feeling he just
    meant \"contemporary\" but -very humanly- wanted to save three syllables.\r\n\r\nAge

    why don\u2019t you?\r\nRather than ask for the answer, ask where to look and how
    to look.\r\nPerhaps your teacher could give you some help with that, as \u201Cexplore

    beyond the obvious choices here. \r\n\r\nThis is kind of the mood I was thinking
    of in the first place:\r\n[[http://www.lammhults.se/]]\r\n\r\nMy teacher didn't
    say my choices for the typography was wrong, he just said it was what one would
    expect, and therefore kind of boring. It doesn't stand out of the crowd, if you
    know what I mean. \r\n\r\nThe world of typography is quite enormous so therefore
    I felt a bit overwhelmed. Thats why I wanted to see what associations other people
    got when they thought of the theme. I wasn't expecting a ready-to-use solution
    here, I just wanted to find a spot in the world of typography were I could start
    looking. :)\r\n\r\nThe suggestions in this post is slowly giving me a new perspective
    of things. Thanks!"

    live a little, explore, try out. Try out things you never have seen and see what

    such short time. This forum is great!\r\n\r\nAs some of you and also my teacher
    pointed out, using Futura is not very creative for this assignment. It's suitable
    cause It makes you think of Ikea (Ikea sans looks almost identical to Futura)
    and numerous other swedish furniture companies, but good graphic design is not
    about reproducing whats already out there. If you want to stand out you need to
    find new and exciting approaches to things.\r\n\r\nSo\u2026 I've left the safe
    Futura-harbour behind and am doing some exploring right now. Fountain and Monokrom,
    for example, are new and pleasant acquaintances. Thanks a lot you guys."

  body: "Like the Swiss design style from the 1950s, the Scandinavian design style
    has a <em>halo effect</em> that reaches beyond borders and time. There are even
    similarities (due to the roots and influences of the time) in both styles, in
    terms of clarity and simplicity of design solutions. \r\n\r\nSwiss design refers
    more to graphics than furniture and has a strong industrial tendency. A great
    distinction of Nordic design is the warmth of bright colours in contrast with
    dark elements, materials like birch wood and soft, organic shapes found in Swedish
    furniture design. \r\n\r\nI believe that a designer\u2019s understanding of Swedish
    design today is more influenced by contemporary interior styles than [[http://www.houzz.com/swedish-style-chairs|what
    people recognize]] as Swedish Design today. It certainly doesn\u2019t stop at
    Ikea.\r\n\r\nFutura is a post WWI font influenced by Art Deco and the Bauhaus
    philosophy. Aside of graphical shapes, it has almost nothing in common with what
    I would classify as modern Swedish furniture style.\r\n\r\nIf warmth, organic
    shapes, bright wood and a lot of white are style elements of Swedish interior
    design, then I would look into a Humanist Sans Serif typeface. Certainly nothing
    industrial, like Helvetica Neue and nothing too close to Bauhaus or Art Deco,
    like Futura.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans|Open Sans]]
    comes to my mind, as well as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/garagefonts/freight-sans-pro/|Freight
    Sans Pro]] (this is the new Facebook font). A great balance provides [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/carnoky/samo-sans-pro/|Samo
    Sans Pro]], which isn\u2019t commonly used, but well designed. Another option
    would be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/r-type/gesta/|Gesta]] \u2013 maybe because
    it has this dry approach with a subtle softness and narrow characters."
