  but I failed to find the project\u2019s website any helpful in this. If I\u2019m
  not completely misguided: there\u2019s not a single font sample to view, no character
  or glyph charts to look at, no subpage for registration, no download site to find.
  Instead, the sub-menus are apparently ill-structured and the \u201Cglyph tables\u201D
  come out as clumsy tapeworm listings, which I find rather discouraging.\r\nNow I
  wonder if they want letting anyone know *something* about it at all.\r\n\u2013 Any
  hot hints for the curiuos?"

    periodically tried to keep up with their development, but it's seemed very slow
    from the outside.\r\n\r\nst"
