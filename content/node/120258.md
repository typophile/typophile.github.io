  for a logo that I am creating. I imported it into photoshop but i forgot to save
  the name and now that I have formated the computer I have obviously lost it. I cannot
  find it anywhere on internet. \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate if you could help
  me identifying the font. I send you the \"e\" with is actually the only letter we
  need.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and best regards,\r\nBorja"
