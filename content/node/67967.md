  body: "This one is a mystery, but it resembles a compressed modification of Benguiat.
    The letterforms are not just compressed Benguiat, but based on the F that's the
    closest style I can think of.\r\n\r\nI have been searching every narrow Art Nouveau
    and spiky serif I can find, but I am not seeing anything close.\r\n\r\nHow old
    is the book this sample comes from?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
