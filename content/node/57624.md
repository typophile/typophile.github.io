  body: "Mike \r\n\r\nI think you are right.\r\n\r\nAs a calligrapher I have always
    been sensitive to the capital S. It is very Windsoresque. There is some Century
    Schoolbook Condensed a la Charlie Hughes thrown in. And a number of other influences.
    The swolen bottom stem/serif formation hint at hand lettering too.\r\n\r\nHence
    an inventive lettering artist may be the culprit : )\r\n\r\nProbably drawn as
    opposed to chisel edged pen rendered.\r\n\r\nMichael"
