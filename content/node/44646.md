body: "I expect to be working on a magazine design very soon. I also expect the budget
  to be small and the timeframe to be tight. I am considering various typefaces for
  editorial, heads, sub-heads, features etc. I really like Neutraface by House Industries,
  the $500 pricetag is a little high but it is comprehensive and has the right mix
  of contemporary and classic to it.\r\nI also really like Gotham by H&FJ and it's
  a little more affordable at $400 complete.\r\n\r\nThe magazine is a local entertainment
  and lifestyle publication. My idea is that by getting the correct type from the
  get-go will set the tone for the rest of the magazine.\r\n\r\nI have no ideas for
  the body type as of yet.\r\n\r\nAny help or pointers would be great.\r\n\r\nJay"

  body: "2 sans families in the same genre do work nicely for a wide range of sizes
    and settings: [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100009&cpuCount=1|Verlag]]
    and [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=615&subpage=neutra_no2_view_fonts|Neutra
    #2.]] I just saw a magazine with Verlag everywhere, and really liked the feel
    of the caps in heads. Then too, the small sizes for captions and callouts were
    very appealing too. \r\n\r\nI haven't played with or seen as much Neutraface (especially
    the new #2 with higher crossbars), but I suspect it feels a little more mechanical
    and geometric. The bowls in Verlag tend to be narrower and less circular. Overall
    it's a very warm impression for a geometric design, maybe more deco than geometric.

    the list.\r\n\r\nANOTHER QUESTION:\r\n\r\nWould I be on the wrong path to use
    the same family for heads and body?\r\n\r\nI need to do some more research and
    see what others are doing and what I like. It seems that if your gonna spend $500
    on a family it would be nice if that could be for the editorial copy too. Maybe
    it's just a matter of taste."

    at Whitney. It\u2019s very gorgeous and very capable; the specimens just don\u2019t
    do it justice. I believe Flaunt has been using it as their text face for a while
    now. <a href=\"http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/index.html\">Also, take a look
    at Jos Buivenga\u2019s free/inexpensive typefaces.</a> I\u2019m doing a magazine
    with only his stuff right now and it looks great! Museo is only $30 for five weights
    that scale well and can create incredible contrast."

    South Florida. I want contemporary with some art-deco undertones.\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks for all the advice guys - please do keep it coming. I am looking at all

  body: "Use a strong serif for body copy and a well-matched sans for heads, subheads,
    sidebars, headlines, etc. Never, but never, consider sans for body copy: nobody
    wants to read that much of any sans.\r\n\r\nThe biggest and crispest serif face
    for 9pt is Stone Serif, and you can use either Stone Sans (designed to go with
    it) or Linotype Syntax for the sans. All can be used with oldstyle figures (Stone
    Serif and Sans have to be ordered from ITC not Adobe if you want the OSFs; Linotype's
    version of Syntax comes with OSFs.)\r\n\r\n10pt Linotype Sabon paired with Linotype
    Syntax, both with OSFs, also works beautifully.\r\n\r\nDon't try to get cute and
    stylish with the body copy, except to use oldstyle figures instead of liner figures.
    Use your headline choice of sans for your big style statement."

  body: Since we're already spending money at H&FJ, the Proteus Project (Acropolis,
    Leviathan, Ziggurat and Saracen) are all great chunky black headline fonts that
    (correct me if I'm wrong) were designed originally for rolling stone. The idea
    is that all four have the exact same character width, allowing for equal interchange
    of them all. Then again, you don't want to be a copycat, and rolling stone isn't
    exactly the same audience either.

  body: "John S.,\r\n\r\nI would think that being located in New York would make it
    obvious to you that magazine publishing is a high-turnover, fashion-driven area
    of design. Are you actually suggesting that a new design for a lifestyle/entertainment
    magazine (not a series of books) use Stone Serif? Way to embalm a design. Cute
    and stylish are actually front and center in magazine design, however upsetting
    this may be for you. \r\n\r\n\"Never, but never, consider sans for body copy:
    nobody wants to read that much of any sans\"\r\n\r\nThis is like your repeated
    squawking about font pricing; it's intended to create the perception that everyone
    wants what you want. Iif you would be bothered to look around, you will discover
    that many, many magazines (again, not books) use all kinds of sans faces at all
    sizes, including for editorial material. The categorical rejection of sans designs
    reveals your conservatism, something that has little place in magazine design.
    \r\n\r\nIn a word: speak for yourself. \r\n\r\nJay,\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why you
    fixate on the highest prices, for the complete superfamilies. It's quite possible
    to develop varied, rich layouts for magazines with a modest family. The Verlag
    and Neutra families I linked to are $200 or $250, not $400 and $500. Do you need
    every single style, width and weight? Examine how you would use the type, and
    then make a corresponding purchase. For $500 you could get 3 wonderful, versatile
    families that would serve you for years. I don't find that the condensed variants
    are nearly as useful as the regular widths. Also, Neutra has text and Display
    variants, and you could just use the Text variants for everything; a sans like
    that scales well. More savings.\r\n\r\nAlso take a look at packages and families
    from Storm; he has made collections you might find useful, and there are superfamilies
    that might work for you: Anselm and Amor; both have serif and sans variants. Look
    at them by categories for font pairing ideas. "

  body: Whether you should use sans or serif for body copy just depends on how text-intensive
    your publication is. In the case of art mags with short articles well broken by
    white space and images, sans works perfectly well, but it should be the more interesting
    ones with aggressive personalities, like DTL Prokyon, Annivers, or Linotype Giacomo.
    Most magazines do not offer such an environment, however; needless to say, it's
    not about conservative vs progressive, a meaningless distinction in design today;
    it's about what is suitable *and* is interesting.

    or at least be engraved\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to try a sans and the writing wasn't
    too long I would second Amor mentioned above (although the serif has a pretty
    strong flavor) and also Apex New, which sets very conservatively and could give
    you some room to breathe in a narrow column, and also has a huge range of alternate
    characters."
