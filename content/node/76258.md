body: "I think I have a question about Ikarus, but having a difficulty in expressing
  the question, I am putting the question in the form of a statement.\r\n\r\nOne of
  my earliest posts to this forum was a complaint about certain characteristics of
  the True Type and Adobe Type 1 font formats, as well as digital font creation tools
  like FontMonger and Fontforge. I felt it would be helpful if one could specify the
  locations of points digitally after working them out on paper, and that it would
  be nice if one could choose conic sections instead of always only Bezier curves.\r\n\r\nSomeone
  responded with the correct deduction that I am no professional type designer.\r\n\r\nBut
  looking randomly at other sections of the site besides the forums, I saw something
  mentioned in the wiki which I researched further elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA program that
  started out using circles (but later added Bezier curves as an option) also had
  other interesting features. One could copy and paste pieces of a character, such
  as the serifs. One could mark \"guard bands\" that would not be squeezed as one
  adjusted the width of the character as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, Ikarus
  from URW; it sounds like something that has the features needed to make creating
  type on a computer a manageable task. Of course, it is no doubt expensive to license,
  but it appears to be worth the price, being used by the major typefoundries.\r\n\r\nHas
  it really been largely superseded by today's font design programs, or are its extra
  features not really that important... am I mistaken in thinking that the designers
  working for the companies that use this technology have an advantage?"

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nIf you want to experiment with this sort of splines, you
    can download and install the free version of DTL\xB4s FontMaster. Ikarus Master,
    the latest incarnation of Ikarus is part of the suite.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonttools.org/\r\n\r\nThe
    free version allow you to create and generate font with up to 256 characters.
    More than enough to play around and learn something about it. The workflow is
    rather different than in FontLab and Fontographer, so you will have to get accustomed
    to it (download the manual also).\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, if you happen to have
    a FontLab license, you can use its \"Sketch Mode\" where PS splines are converted
    to an imitation of Ikarus splines. It is not as precise as Ikarus, but it worth
    trying if you like the enviroment...\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nRamiro.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    like an Aristo tablet and Ikarus makes sense. Drawing directly on-screen using
    Ikarus splines is a nightmare.\r\n\r\nIkarus was the first font development program
    I worked with but I would never go back. IMO bezier curves are much easier to
    handle than Ikarus splines."
