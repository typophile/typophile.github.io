  body: "The \u010E, \u011A, \u0147, \u0158, and \u0148 glyphs in all weights also
    have the extraneous graves.\r\n\r\nAlso, the small caps variations are affected.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/armasen/caturrita/light/glyphs/515848/383\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/armasen/caturrita/medium/glyphs/515850/351\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/armasen/caturrita/bold/glyphs/515851/500"

    also looks like a problem.

  body: "Congrats, Bruno. Caturrita has a very nice design. These are the problems
    I found:\r\n\r\n<strong>01</strong>. tilde is very heavy and does not fit the
    base weight.\r\n<strong>02</strong>. the same occurs with commaccent, although
    it is less apparent.\r\n<strong>03</strong>. tilde distance to base letter is
    excessive.\r\n<strong>04</strong>. cedilla is dislocated to the left.\r\n<strong>05</strong>.
    ogonek exceeds the base glyph limit at right.\r\n<strong>06</strong>. ogonek weight
    is also very heavy to lowercase bases.\r\n<strong>07</strong>. macron needs more
    distance to lowercase bases.\r\n<strong>08</strong>. hungarumlaut needs to be
    more narrow.\r\n<strong>09</strong>. slash is not centered in \xF8.\r\n<strong>10</strong>.
    slash is very heavy in \xD8.\r\n<strong>11</strong>. the final group shown in
    MyFonts uses PUA Unicodes.\r\n<strong>12</strong>. there are two glyphs not shown
    between the last ones.\r\n"

  body: Thanks Igor and hrant for your great feedback, surely I'll review it, starting
    work on new weights and maybe go for italic forms. Then certainly your opinion
    will be regard.
