		<div class="commentbody">Hrant- The face is also a combination of two letterforms, the T and the Y (the T being stacked over the Y).  After creating it, I did think of the Mac Os logo.  I don't particularly care for that logo.  I always find myself looking for a hidden meaning in the Mac Os logo that I never find.   <BR> <BR>Scott- I wasn't thinking of this as a mark/icon in place of type, but as a combination of both. I haven't tried many fluid/organic versions, but perhaps there would be some possibilities there.  One of the reasons that it is currently so geometric is because I have often heard that a good logo should fit within a square (for reducing, placement, compactness, etc).  But I'm open to ideas.  <BR> <BR>Thanks for the comments.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott- I came across the &quot;square theory&quot; in my undergrad program.  My professor for Corporate Identity said that often times logos have to fit within a square for their applications (corner of letterhead, homepage, business card, t-shirt pocket.)  I don't believe, and I don't think my professor believed that this was a hard fast rule, but that it was a starting place, and to venture out meant you had a good reason.  Another way I have often heard this idea described is that &quot;a good logo should be able to roll down hill&quot;.  So anything that fits nicely into a square, like a circle, would roll (probably much better than a square).  I think the main purpose of this kind of thinking was to encourage designers to consider the application limitations of a logo that has extreme horizontal or vertical dimensions.  But yeah, how boring would it be if all logos were square?</div>

Plus it seems to me that this consideration is secondary to other things in a good logo, like memorability, which is not square at all.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Ty, <BR> <BR>Thanks for posting the logos. They are nice, particularly Lucky 7 and Quote 66. After comparison, your mark does seem to be *on the money* with regards to your style, though I think possibly not as strong as the two mentioned above, but stronger than the 3rd example. <BR> <BR>Many people here have responded positively, so don't let me discourage you. As I said, not my favorite logo, but what you do with it now will speak volumes also: type choice, stationary layout etc. <BR> <BR>I just had an idea: what if you were to design your idenity around the concept of identity. You could make the top of your letterhead into a government form with a box for your thumbprint (actually print each one), lines for your name and info (hand write it in), etc. There would certainly be room for wit in a gov't form! Same for business card &amp; envelope. If you didn't want to fill in by hand, you could type them (ahhhhh. with an actual typewriter). If you are like me, you probably won't go through huge amounts of stationary so the crafty approach could save cash. This would certainly be memorable if it came across my desk. Just a thought to consider. <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Speaking of identity, have you considered my question? It's a great idea well-executed, making your name into a face, but it gives me a strong expectation of what you ought to look like if I were to meet you (as your clients surely will). If you're skinny with a narrow nose and arched brows, people may say, &quot;Oh, sorry to disturb you, I was looking for Ty, is he here?&quot; It's a flexible enough concept to be re-proportioned into a caricature assuming it isn't one already.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks everyone for the positive responses to the &quot;one on the right&quot;.  I'm actually still somewhat torn between that one and the original (with a thicker lined smirk).  The typography and face read better in the most recent one, but somehow a square seems more profound in its simplicity.  I keep thinking about what Troy said about the original one: &quot;It also seems like it lends itself to embellishments for the sake of self-promo pieces in the future (I'm reminded of the old constantly changing MTV logo).&quot;  Is the new one as versatile for applications and embellishments?</div>

I <BR>As I was quoted as someone with that opinion, I'm not sure if there is any official school of thought along those lines. But logograms were invented for large corporations and historically stem from royal/clerical heraldic signs&hellip; I just don't feel that a small shop or a single individual NEEDS a visual sign, which to me &ndash; like any kind of corporate identity &ndash; is a bit military and krypto-fascistic (Hitler being the guy who went Corporate Identity on a nation-wide-basis first and still stands as an example what CD/CI should NOT be about),  <BR> <BR>I jus think this is a none-to-thought-through approach when it comes to small companies or even individuals. With a logogram you're imitating the visual langugae of large corporations (which NEED such signs to be recognizable internationally, especially as they lack a really individual face-to-face-communication, thus opting for the next best thing, virtual comminucation).  <BR> <BR>Now, an individual or small shop doesn't need that, as they still Do communicate personally. Faking a corporate ID is simply amounting to DE-humanizing what is ideally something much more and much better than any CD McDonalds or Nike can EVER come up with&hellip; so this, imo, is contraproductive to what I try to do: create a personality. A large companie need a CD to establish a virtual identity recognizable to customers and workers&hellip; but does a small bakery need that? I don't think so.  <BR> <BR>And as I'm effing tired of the overkill-overload of logos and imagery and pseudo-corporate-designs and all-too-clever-ideas for every boy and his dog, I absurdly find myself in a anti-design position, trying to talk my clients OUT of all this clever designery stuff, opting for a simpler, more 50s-ish solution of a good typeface, good paper and all that :-D.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Ty <BR> <BR>I hate to be the problem child but I like your original mark better than this new version.  <BR>Your first mark had a nice edgy, mischievous vibe, whereas the new one seems kind of bland and vanilla by comparison. <BR> <BR>I also like the compositional power of the face-in-a-square you had originally. There is a nice kind of tension that is created by a composition like this that is so obviously simple geometric shapes but at the same time is completely recognizable as another thing &ndash; in this case a face (and your name).  The geometric simplicity &ndash; making it all work in a simple square &ndash; adds a layer of surprise, like seeing a magic trick pulled off successfully. The &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; logo is like that: it's just a few circles, but you can't look at it without seeing a cat. <BR> <BR>Possible idea for the future: if you go with the flat-bottomed version #1, you could have three-dimentional blocks made by a woodcutter and they could sit on your desk either in the &quot;face&quot; configuration (like your logo), or you could separate them and sit them next to each other so they are recognizable only as letters. What the hell, you could have these made and give them away as a promo (someday). The interactive logo. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, that's my long-winded two cents. <BR> <BR>Troy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Ty <BR>My idea for the blocks was more like what Scott is describing, with the letter shapes cut out of two sides (I guess you could say the front and back). If you have the shapes cut out of all four sides (like you've illustrated), it presents a problem of how to make the negative space  above the y's tail (the face's &quot;mouth&quot;). But one option to doing it the way you've illustrated is that you could paint each side a different color, so the corresponding t and y of the same color could be aligned on the same side, the unity of which would emphasize the &quot;face,&quot; or you could line up a t and y of different colors, which would make more obvious the letterforms. <BR>I'm not sure if I'm making myself clear, it's kind of hard to describe in words. <BR> <BR>Any of the logo versions you have will look cool. Also I really like the card design. <BR> <BR>Troy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was getting my materials together to enter my logo in the Graphis design annual, and on the form they asked for the &quot;title&quot; of my logo.  While perhaps not the most significant issue to my self identity, I thought a clever title could be another way to demonstrate my creativity.  After initially thinking of &quot;Ty - Self Idenity&quot;, &quot;Ty - Face (Self Identity)&quot; etc, I realized that it was really important to me that the judges recognize that my logo is not only a face, but a T and a Y as well.  So then the idea dawned on me to call the logo &quot;TYpeFACE&quot;.  This is one word that contains all three words that I want to communicate: &quot;Ty&quot;, &quot;face&quot; &amp; &quot;typeface&quot;.  What do you think?   <BR> <BR>The font is a modification of House Gothic Extended Bold 2.  I haven't purchased the font yet, so this is actually just an Illustrator rendering based off their websites'  LetterSetter display.  If I decide I like the font enough to use it, I will purchase it.    <BR> <BR>I've also posted 2 examples of providing a &quot;caption&quot; for my logo.  I don't know if this is necessarily a good idea; I like the logo by itself.  But, for contest submissions and other times when I have to give the logo a &quot;name&quot;, maybe this would be good.  I have in in grayscale because I'm still undecided on color. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24204.jpg" alt=""> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24205.jpg" alt=""></div>

I'm looking at this thread and seeing 110 posts, all based on Ty's willingness to accept that. Funny how things work out; here's a guy who's willing to adapt and overcome, and the results speak for themselves. You go, Ty. Break the sound barrier of design, one selfless step at a time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice work indeed, Ty. Congratulations. I guess I'm a little late reading this thread but here's my after-the-fact-insignificant-because-it's-already-in-Graphis two cents: I did get a <a href="http://www.goodwill.org">Goodwill</a> meets Decepticon vibe from it like Tanya. Although I don't think it's anything striking enough to worry about as it has already proven to be unique in the minds of many scrutinous typophiles and judges.</div>

<p>I graduated with a BFA in Graphic Design in 2003 from Auburn University. Since then I have worked as the in-house designer at a manufacturing plant in Macon, Georgia. My most recent branding work is featured in Graphis Logo 6 &amp; LogoLounge II. I am looking for a full-time Junior Graphic Designer position (preferably in branding), and I am willing to relocate to virtually any city in the US. My original conceptual work can be viewed at <a href="http://www.tywilkins.com">www.tywilkins.com</a></p>
<p>Thanks again to the good folks of Typophile for all of your support.</p>
