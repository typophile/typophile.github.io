  little. \r\nIt was going to be a train set that fit on Brio tracks. \r\n\r\nPut
  it aside to look for non-toxic paints and an got busy and never got back to the
  project.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/june_07 011_6231.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/june_07

    before going back to their X-Box or Nintendo.\r\n\r\nBut maybe you can still finish
    it off for the grandkids before they are too jaded, and post a photo when you
    are done.\r\n; )"

  body: It looks great. The shapes have some speed! Brio is a great toy, but I've
    given credit to Legos for artistic inspiration.
