    Seattle offices for the past few years, and involved in text and font support
    in InDesign and other products. Paul is being hired in what I presume to be an
    entry level position in the type group, whereas Thomas was let go from a much
    higher level position in a different department."

  body: "<em>...quite unrelated to my departure...</em>\r\n\r\nThe right hand may
    not know what the left hand is doing, but there is no doubt some higher corporate
    awareness of hiring and firing, that would consider layoffs of middle-income staff
    a responsible policy during a recessional period of reduced income, instilling
    confidence in analysts and shareholders that management is on the ball and keeping
    pace with industry norms, whereas scooping relatively inexpensive fresh talent
    from the mills of Academia would warrant priority, even if such programs are cut
    back. That's not a conspiracy, it's just the way that many corporations work (especially
    those that are publicly traded and non-unionized), putting performance before
    people. Small companies may also have to lay off employees when business is down,
    but owners/management are more likely to take a hit in the wallet before allowing
    that to happen. However, in lieu of such personal commitment, larger corporations
    are better at severance packages.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are those corporations
    whose policy it is to avoid mass layoffs, through other measures such as voluntary
    time off, job sharing, job shifting and voluntary pay cuts.\r\n\r\nPaul, I hope
    they are hiring you for your abilities in original type design, and not just competency
    in font production. At any rate, you've been around, paid you dues, so make the
    most of your time on the gravy train!"
