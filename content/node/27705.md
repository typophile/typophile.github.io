  body: Similar to Gill, and <A HREF="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.htm?pid=205027">ITC
    Johnston</A> but not an exact match for either. Is this a print of a poster from
    the London underground?

  body: Another interpretation is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=PY.114314.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=KEEP+CALM&sampleSize=48">P22
    Underground</a>. The key difference is in the 'C' which has angled ends in your
    sample. To a lesser extent the 'M' and 'E'. I don't think there is an existing
    font which will match.
