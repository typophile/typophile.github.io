    a calligrapher as evidenced by his book Our Calligraphic Heritage. But that is
    splitting hairs. And his sculpture was phenomenal.

  body: "from:\r\n\r\nIsmar David, German/Israeli/American (1910 - 1996)\r\n\r\n...
    and on June 3rd of that year, married Hortense Mendel. Ismar had met\r\nHortense,
    an associate of Robert Leslie at the Composing Room, during \r\nhis 1951 trip
    to New York to show Intertype hisHebrew alphabets. \r\nThe two spent six years
    together before Hortense died on October 9, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole article:\r\n\r\nIsmar
    David, German/Israeli/American (1910 - 1996)\r\n\r\nIsmar David, considered one
    of the few graphic designers, illustrators, and calligraphers of international
    reputation, was a\r\nGerman-born graphic artist who practiced the first third
    of his\r\nprofessional career in Jerusalem and the remainder in New\r\nYork City.
    He is noted for his brilliant work in Hebrew and\r\nLatin calligraphy, lettering,
    and type design, as well as for his\r\ndistinctive linear style of illustration.David
    liked to say that the\r\nhand is the most marvelous tool if properly trained,
    and his\r\nown handwork supports this conviction.\r\n\r\nIsmar David was born
    in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw,\r\nPoland) on August 27, 1910. At the age of
    fourteen, he left\r\nschool to apprentice as a house painter and varnisher. After\r\nreceiving
    his journeyman papers, however, he returned to\r\nstudy decorative painting at
    the Arts & Crafts School of Berlin-\r\nCharlottenberg, where many of the finest
    book craftsmen of\r\nthe first part of the century taught and studied.Hans Orlowski\r\nand
    Johannes Boeland were among his teachers.\r\n\r\nIn 1932, at the age of twenty-one,
    Ismar David entered and won\r\nan international competition sponsored by the Jewish
    National\r\nFund for the design of its honorary Golden Book. He traveled\r\nto
    Jerusalem to supervise the execution of the project, and he\r\nsettled there for
    the next twenty years and established a studio\r\nfor interior and graphic design.
    In addition to receiving a\r\nbroad range of commissions from private industry,
    David\r\naccepted commissions from national institutions and the state\r\ngovernment
    for design projects including posters, postage\r\nstamps, and currency.\r\nDuring
    his residence in Jerusalem, Ismar David made one of\r\nhis most important contributions
    to twentieth century graphic\r\ndesign with the conception and development of
    an innovative\r\nfamily of Hebrew typefaces. His interest in developing Hebrew\r\ntypes
    that would be in harmony with the modern spirit and\r\nthat would help to transform
    Hebrew into an everyday\r\nlanguage eventually lead to David Hebrew. This unshaded
    and\r\nunserifed type design was cast for machine composition in\r\n1954 by the
    Intertype Corporation and was later available on\r\nthe Photon machine. In 1984
    the Stempel type foundry\r\ncommissioned David to rerender David Hebrew with diacritical\r\nmarks
    for digital composition. To this day David Hebrew is\r\nwidely used and much copied.
    The light appearance of David\r\nHebrew makes it well suited for setting poetry.
    It is also favored\r\nfor use in exhibition catalogs, finely printed books, and
    Israeli\r\nnewspaper supplements.\r\n\r\nBefore moving permanently to the United
    States, Ismar David\r\nmade several visits to New York City.His first trip, in
    1939, was\r\nto work on the Palestine Pavilion at the New York World\u2019s Fair.\r\nIn
    1947, he traveled to New York to study printing methods.\r\nWith the help of Dr.
    Robert Leslie, he returned in 1951 to make\r\narrangements with the Intertype
    Corporation for the casting of\r\nDavid Hebrew. And finally in 1952, David visited
    New York to\r\ndesign and install an industrial exhibition for Bonds for Israel.\r\nIsmar
    David emigrated to the United States in 1953, and on\r\nJune 3rd of that year,
    married Hortense Mendel. Ismar had met\r\nHortense, an associate of Robert Leslie
    at the Composing\r\nRoom, during his 1951 trip to New York to show Intertype hisHebrew
    alphabets. The two spent six years together before\r\nHortense died on October
    9, 1960.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival in New York City in 1953, Ismar David established\r\na
    design studio and began teaching Latin calligraphy at\r\nCooper Union and Pratt
    Institute. He had expected the bulk of\r\nhis commissions to come from designing
    decorative elements\r\nfor synagogues, however, he found his mainstay work in
    the\r\n1950\u2019s, 60\u2019s, and early 70\u2019s in the publishing industry.
    David\r\nworked steadily as a designer for leading American publishers\r\nincluding
    Alfred A. Knopf; Atlantic, Little Brown; Ballantine\r\nBooks; Fleming H. Revell;
    Harper & Row; Harry Abrams;\r\nHoughton Mifflin Company; J.B. Lippincott Company;
    McGraw-\r\nHill; Pocket Books; Random House; Thomas Y. Crowell; and\r\nViking
    Press, among others. In a short span, he designed book\r\njackets or covers for
    more than 200 books.\r\n\r\nIsmar David remained a free-lance artist throughout
    his career.\r\nIn addition to steady work in cover design, calligraphy, and\r\nlettering,
    Ismar David earned commissions for book illustration\r\nand developed the style
    of illustration for which he is best\r\nremembered\u2014a style characterized
    by striking patterns of\r\nlines. This distinctive linear style was particularly
    well suited\r\nfor the Limited Edition Club\u2019s 1971 publication of Pascal\u2019s
    Les\r\nPens\xE9es, for which David created a dozen full-page, hypnotic\r\ncolor-illustrations\u2014pre-separated
    in the tradition of printmaking\u2014\r\nas well as ornamental tailpieces, and
    text frames. As\r\nwould become his custom, Ismar\u2019s conceptions in vivid\r\noranges,
    greens, purples, blues, and golds were meant to\r\naccompany the thoughts of the
    author, not to illustrate them literally.His 58 illustrations for the Union of
    American Hebrew\r\nCongregation\u2019s 1973 bilingual edition of The Psalms followed\r\nthe
    same non-literal approach. For this project, which David\r\nconsidered his most
    personal work, he combined his ideas\r\nabout illustration and type and book design,
    and his efforts\r\nwere recognized by The American Institute of Graphic Arts\r\n(AIGA)
    with a 1973 \u201CFifty Books of the Year\u201Ddistinction. Both\r\nLes Pens\xE9es
    and The Psalms proved to be very popular among\r\ncollectors, and they stand as
    two of his best efforts in book\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nThough he never lost interest
    in graphics, much of David\u2019s\r\nenergy in the latter part of his career was
    devoted to architectural\r\ndesign and decoration. Perhaps his most important
    work\r\nin this field was produced during a thirty-year association with\r\nPinelawn
    Memorial Park in Farmingdale, NY. Beginning in\r\n1965, he planned the layout
    of the park, including fountains and\r\nother features; he also designed mausoleums
    and other\r\nbuilding complexes, and their interiors. He also lettered\r\nnumerous
    inscriptions for wall decorations and architectural\r\nfeatures in the park. \r\n\r\nProof
    of Ismar David\u2019s uninterrupted\r\nconnection with graphics came in 1991,
    when in collaboration\r\nwith calligrapher and partner Helen Brandshaft, he designed\r\nand
    illustrated a bilingual version of The Book of Jonah,\r\npublished by the Chiswick
    Press in a limited edition.\r\nTeaching was another constant element in Ismar
    David\u2019s career.\r\nIn addition to instructing at the Cooper Union and Pratt\r\nInstitute,
    he gave lectures and conducted workshops on Latin\r\nand Hebrew calligraphy over
    the years. Eventually he distilled his well-tested teaching materials and summarized
    his views on the historical, aesthetic, and technical aspects of the Latin alphabet
    into Our Calligraphic Heritage: The Geyer Studio Writing Book. The three-part
    work of text, alphabet folders, and\r\ncompositions, encased in a box designed
    to function as an\r\neasel, was published in a limited edition in 1979 by the
    Geyer\r\nStudio\u2014a professional calligraphy studio for whom David\r\nworked
    as a contractor from the late 1960\u2019s through the early\r\n1980\u2019s. Ismar
    produced the Hebrew counterpart to Our\r\nCalligraphic Heritage with the 1990
    publication of The Hebrew\r\nLetter: Calligraphic Variations. This instructional
    work\r\nincludes a text and alphabet charts, and is a writing book in the\r\ntradition
    of European writing books. In both works, David\r\nfuses the rich historical background
    of the calligraphic arts\r\nwith practical and aesthetic aspects of the art of
    writing in the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1990s, Ismar David continued
    to take on select\r\ncommissions for graphic design; however, he also expressed
    his\r\npersonal interest in three-dimensional form with the creation\r\nof such
    objects as a folding baby cradle and a paper Elijah\u2019s cup\r\nand folding
    seder plate. Before he died on February 26, 1996, in\r\nNew York City, Ismar David
    produced his 1996 greeting card\u2014\r\nthe last in a forty-odd-year series that
    traces the evolution of\r\nhis lettering and illustration styles, and the constant
    influence\r\nof biblical themes."

    by changing some of the letters that he didn't like so much like the Shin. Gutman
    was recognising that the font was designed by Koren, but changed by Gutman. This
    was not done with permission of Koren Publishers Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nKoreen was
    named such because Masterfont was creating a version of Koren. Again recognising
    the fact that the font was based on Koren and to this day still pays royalties
    on the font. I again must reiterate that the Koreen font was created with permission
    and approval of Koren Publishers Jerusalem and even Eliyahu Koren himself went
    over some of the nuances of this version of the typeface."

    were the same, let me just say this one more time, the SAME font. For both these

    a book as a photograph, hand-written or not. Your sample seems like a reproduction
    of a page from an old book. It seems hand-written.\r\n\r\nBut a typeface design
    can be a machine-made text, too - in a book, or from a desktop printer.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I revived the Romm family letter forms, what is mine? Only the computer code which
    produces the images. \r\n\r\nThe fact that the image of your aleph appears a particular
    way is your effort. But, in this case, the image is public domain.\r\n\r\nIf you
    make the same font, it's not copying - it's just another rendition. Do you agree?\r\n"

    where he taught) was named at first, \"Queen Esther\". This is allusion to Hadasa,
    for the Talmud tells us that \"Esther's real name is Hadasa\". When I worked closely
    with John Hudson (who designed the nikkud and taam), \"Queen Esther\" was renamed
    after its great creator, Henri Friedlaender zal.\r\n\r\nMr. Friedlander told me
    in 1988 that my version was closest to the original drawings. The is likely due
    to the fact that I did not use photo-typesetting specimens. Rather, I used old
    magazines and newspapers as specimens. I created it by eye only, and a crude grid
    system. In those days, I didn't have a scanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Onk_Ber1_bold_5299.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ruth_henri_v5_4135.jpg]"

    L. Magnes, President of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem asked Eliyahu Koren,
    then Korngold, to create a new font for an entirely new edition of the Hebrew
    Bible that he sought to publish under the University's auspices during World War
    II. The Bible was to be the first Bible designed, edited, printed, and bound by
    Jews in nearly 500 years. A design competition was held, and Korngold's font won.\r\nThe
    preliminary version of the font that grew out of the competition was used in an
    edition of the Book of Jonah issued in 1946 by the publishing house of The Hebrew
    University (later Magnes Press). The font was not cast for this modest publication,
    but rather drawn by Korngold and reproduced photographically. The font was based
    on the Moshe Ben-Asher Codex of the Prophets manuscript, belonging to the Karaite
    community in Cairo, the earliest Medieval manuscript with a colophon, written
    in 895 CE in Tiberius."
