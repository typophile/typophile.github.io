  the depths of the internet to find a solution to my problem.\r\n\r\nWhenever a file
  is imported that needs to have its background knocked out (through either a PSD
  with no background, or a clipping mask in various other formats) the type on the
  page its on becomes sickly and thin in appearance. \r\n\r\nI have tried most everything
  to fix it, from my previous research such as placing the type on a higher layer,
  putting it on the same layer but changing the stacking order. And a few other things.
  These have no effect on my typeface oddity. It seems that my problem cant be solved
  with the usual fixes.\r\n\r\nI would very much appreciate any input or solutions
  that anyone here has. \r\n\r\nHumbly Yours,\r\n\r\nJeremy Lee"

    to figure the layout with this strange emaciated typeface. '

    seem a stupid thing to say, are you previewing the page at highest res?"

  body: Most certainly I am, the other blocks of type look perfect except anything
    that appears on the same page as something transparent.

  body: "May be an issue with Flattening. There are 3 default settings for flattening
    (to be found in Export Adobe PDF: Advanced: Transparancy Flattener) \u2014 Low,
    High and Medium. These act differently when parts of the layout are rasterized.
    \r\n\r\nYou can also make up your own setting(s) under Edit: Transparency Flattener
    Presets. Sliders give you options regarding the balance between raster and outline.
    \r\nPlay around with this to find out what solves your problem.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert
