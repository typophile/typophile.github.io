  item I've seen in a while and it's a perfect gift for a buddy of mine. . .\r\n\r\nhttp://www.marksandspencer.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=1&Section_Id=8349&Product_Id=1900505\r\n\r\nProblem
  is, they only ship within the UK and I'm in the states . . . Are there any generous
  UK residents that would assist me in the purchase of this item so it could be shipped
  over?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your assistance even if this is a little off
  topic, it always reminds me type is truly an international community . . .\r\n\r\nStuart
  :D"
