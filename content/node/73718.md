  Fran\xE7ois Porchez]] was approached at the end of 2009 by [[http://www.reflexgroup.com/|Reflex
  Image]] to create a set of typefaces to relaunch the Conqueror papers collection.
  An important website and various others communications material was created by the
  agency. The designer [[http://www.seblester.co.uk/|Seb Lester]] and the photographer
  [[http://www.thomasbrown.info/|Thomas Brown]] have been hired to created various
  visuals using Conqueror fonts.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nLaunched in 2010, [[http://conqueror.com/#/en/typography/types|AW
  Conqueror is a family of Free fonts available at Conqueror.com website.]] This family
  include 5 variations with great potential: Small glyph sets, mostly all caps, but
  based on same structure, with some connection between them (width for example),
  to offer a great & easy titling toolbox to any designers, from skillful to beginner.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/awconqueror_launch2_6322.png]\r\n\r\nWe
  should recall that a [[http://conqueror.com|paper collection]]is generally based
  on similar roots, with various \u201Cflavors,\u201D colors. A collection of typefaces
  should reflect this similar mood, even the style of papers should be reflected into
  the fonts. The typefaces style built all together the brand. Each of the members
  try their best to be different from the others because of their features. They should
  work harmoniously in contrast.\r\n\r\n-- Fonts preview and download: http://www.conqueror.com/#/en/typography/types\r\n--
