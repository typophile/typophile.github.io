  I&#39;m looking for a way to manage my style sheets in a more user-friendly manner
  than just a big list. I&#39;ve been haphazardly messing with the default Movable
  Type templates and now I need to un-screw them a bit. <BR> <BR>Related: are there
  apps that can map this stuff automatically? I do my web stuff straight to the code,
  so I don&#39;t have much knowledge of apps like GoLive, even though I have it.'

  body: Hey Chris. Maybe <a href="http://www.macrabbit.com/cssedit/" target="_blank">CSSEdit</a>
    is for you. I&#39;ve learned much  <BR>about how CSS works just by tossing other
    sites&#39; sheets into it, <BR>and its preview window really helps quickly visualize
    changes to  <BR>your own code.

  body: 'Chris, there are as many different methods as there are folks that use them.
    There hasn&#39;t been a standard that has surfaced, but here are a few things
    I like to do: <BR> <BR>&#43; Separate typographical styles from structural styles
    <BR>&#43; Group variations of a style together &#40;indented below the main style&#41;
    <BR>&#43; Be consistent in the way you write your rules, i.e. if you use shorthand,
    always use shorthand. Makes it easier to find in search/replaces. <BR>&#43; Comment
    as much as you need to remind yourself of what you did and why'

  body: 'Sorry, a few addenda: <BR> <BR>&#43; Use id and class names that have meaning.
    It adds semantic value and makes it easier for you to remember what the style
    rule is supposed to do/affect. <BR>&#43; Try to use as many of the given elements
    &#40;h1, h2, h3, p, etc&#41; before resorting to &#39;classitis&#39;'

  body: 'Andy&#39;s advice is good. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean
    by automatic &#39;mapping&#39;. <BR> <BR>As for keeping your style sheets organized,
    I use a variety of techniques: <BR> <BR> - I use multiple style sheets when appropriate
    <BR> - I comment like crazy. I typically group my styles into logical, commented
    groups. ie masthead styles, body content styles, navigation styles, etc.'

  body: <i>I&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean by automatic &#39;mapping&#39;.
    </i> <BR> <BR>Now that I think about it, it&#39;s not something that could be
    mapped automatically. I guess I was looking for a way to create a &#39;style hierarchy
    tree&#39; that I could use to quickly see what attributes are controlled at what
    &#39;level&#39;. But, since you create that hierarchy only in your naming and
    use, it&#39;s probably not realistic. Really, from what Andy&#39;s said, I just
    need to figure that out for myself. <BR> <BR>Thank you for the suggestions. If
    you have any more, keep them coming. I&#39;m going to dive in tonight, so any
    guidance is great!

  body: 'Chris, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve heard of some who use OmniGraffle or other wireframing
    software to set up such a tree to help visual a site&#39;s style&#40;s&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>However, unless you need the boxes and arrows, you can accomplish the same
    thing by structuring your CSS file in a heirarchial fashion with commenting. <BR>
    <BR>For example, say you have a calendar in your sidebar on an archives page.
    <BR> <BR>You could reference the &#60;p&#62; tags in this heirarchially in your
    stylesheet as so &#40;&#39;----&#39; used for tab space&#41;: <BR> <BR> <BR>.archives
    #sidebar #calendar p { <BR>----font-size:70%; <BR>} <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a bit wordy
    and of course you could simply write &#34;#calendar p&#34;, but it doesn&#39;t
    hurt and gives you several levels with which to organize, indent and heirarchitize
    your styles, e.g.: <BR> <BR>.archives #sidebar  { <BR>----width:150px; <BR>} <BR>----.archives
    #sidebar #calendar  { <BR>--------background:#fefded; <BR>----} <BR>--------.archives
    #sidebar #calendar p { <BR>------------font-size:70%; <BR>--------}'

    But in case you are not <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">
    TopStyle</a> has a <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/tour/siterpt.asp">
    feature called site reports</a> that might be what you&#39;re looking for. I find
    it pretty handy myself.

    fonts at the moment&#41;, but it looks very interesting.
