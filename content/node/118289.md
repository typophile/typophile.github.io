  body: "I think it could just be a regular font without anti-aliasing, as was more
    common back in the day. I can recall the stylised upper case C, G and S, but can't
    for the life of me remember the name of it. I initially thought it may have been
    the bitmap version Geneva, but that's not it.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urtd/pexico-micro/gallery.html|Pexico
    Micro]] is not it either, but may help."
