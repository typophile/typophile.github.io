body: "I am developing a corporate brand for a company called 'All Styled Steel'\r\nThis
  can't be abbreviated for obvious reasons, so all 3 words need to be included.\r\nAt
  the moment i'm trying to find examples of good logos with 3 or more words to look
  at.\r\nI'm also trying to figure out whether this can be just typographic or if
  it needs a mark. \r\n\r\nIt would be really helpful if you could link me to some
  logos with a few words in them.\r\nthanks!"
