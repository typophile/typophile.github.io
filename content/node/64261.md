  body: "I would suggest that may have been customized from Futura as a starting point.
    The i is an l with a line across it. The t and f might be those letters with extenders.
    All the vertical letters have been lengthened from the original font.\r\n\r\n-

  body: I'd guess it's a custom font. FWIW, I found <a href="http://fritz-kola.de/fileadmin/redakteure/pdf/RZ_fk_Spruehschablonen.pdf">this
    PDF</a> that has more of it (but converted to outlines).
