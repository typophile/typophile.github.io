  to working condition.  Yesterday I dumped thousand of fonts into ~Library/Fonts.
  \ My system became unstable.  I tried using Linotype FontExplorer X to turn off
  all but 1000 fonts, but my mac was still hosed.  Certain apps would crash as soon
  as they started.  I used TIme Machine to restore that directory to its prior state,
  and now I'm back in working condition.\r\n\r\nI would love to have all of these
  fonts as a resource.  How do I use them without causing problems for my mac?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: You should load them into a font management program like FontExplorer or Extensis
    Suitcase. That fact that you're "dumping" thousands of fonts into your system
    leads me to believe that many are either shareware and/or of highly questionable
    quality. I'm not sure about FontExplorer but Suitcase will weed out or repair
    corrupted fonts as you add them. And you should only activate a few fonts for
    general use and others on an as-needed basis.

  body: "I bought for myself Suitcase a very long time ago. I always urged my customers
    to buy it too, and make it a habit to use it, and not Apple's font installation
    approach (from FontMover to the Library's font folder etc.).\r\n\r\nAs you see,
    I am strongly recommending it to you.\r\n\r\nYou could group the fonts into different
    \"suitcases\" based upon styles or different needs.\r\n\r\nSuitcase is an excellent
    product. It has been around for a few decades, and is being constantly updated
    for compatibility with new Mac operating systems."

    on FontBook vs. Suitcase?\r\n\r\nI did previously have Suitcase when on Windows."

  body: I haven't been impressed with FontBook (although it has gotten better). I
    have used Suitcase - and it worked well. But I prefer the light footprint and
    responsiveness of FontExplorer and thus I am currently using it.
