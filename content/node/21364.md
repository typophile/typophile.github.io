    </a> or <a/href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=microgramma\">Microgramma</a>,
    just with various bits chopped out of them."

    body: "Hi Ben,\r\nThanks for the response - the characters in Eurostile or Microgramma
      are much more hard edged than the one on the logo (E, F, L & D) - they're quite
      different and curved...\r\n\r\nbut thanks anyhow...\r\n\r\nAnyone else care
      to enlighten me?? (please!!)"
