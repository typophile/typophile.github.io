    Sans]] from BA Graphics. My suspicion is that this is custom, so close is the
    best we're going to do.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/columna/solid-rounded/|Columna
    Solid Rounded]] is another similar look, but the R is less like the original than
    the previous two choices.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
