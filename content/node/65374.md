    but that could be a rasterization issue I guess. A larger sample would help :)"

  body: "OK, one can get \"sort of but not really\" close with Impact set to \"Smooth\"
    antialiasing in Photoshop (CS4) and \"in profile\" in Georgia set to \"Crisp\".
    And in any case there's all sorts of weird kerning action.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/states_3864.gif]\r\n"

  body: That's rather different though, like in the arm of the "r" and the top of
    the "f".
