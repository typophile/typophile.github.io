    and only half black, I think. Does it matter?  :-&#41; <BR>But you might find
    some more among the &#34;Building Letters&#34; guys. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I think it unlikely that you will find any mid-20th century black American
    type designers per se, but if you dug hard enough in the right places -- e.g.
    Harlem -- you would almost certainly turn up interesting work by local sign painters
    of that period, some of whom may be identifiable.

  body: Also, dare I mention the original graffiti writers of NYC? Their distinctive
    writing has spawned countless imitations and cheesy fonts. <BR> <BR>&#40;Not all
    of these writers were black... some where white and hispanic&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;I
    wonder if we&#39;re supposed to accept <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=203876">Mo
    Funky Fresh</a> as a &#34;black&#34; font?&#41;

    by black artists.

    cool, shoot it.
