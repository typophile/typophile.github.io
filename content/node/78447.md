body: I need to find a font to replace Formata Bold Condensed Italic, which seems
  to be only available from major foundries at too high a cost. Any ideas for a replacement
  would be much appreciated.

  body: "I assume you are referring to the package price. \r\n\r\nYou can get CamingoDos
    Pro Condensed Bold Italic for $65, as it\u2019s sold as both single fonts and
    packages. See [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jan-fromm/camingo-dos-pro-condensed/|here]].
    CamingoDos is a humanist sans like Formata, and it\u2019s also available in regular
    and semi-condensed versions.\r\n\r\nThis obviously depends on how far you\u2019re
    prepared to stray from Formata \u2026"
