  BUT there doesnt seem to be any means of selecting all text or all objects with
  X stroke colour. You can find and replace complex paragraph styles, but the former
  seems to be completely left out. I've searched high and low with no luck. Can anyone
  confirm or deny my lack of findings?\r\n\r\nsorry to irritate with questions..."
