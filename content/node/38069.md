  body: "J\xE1n that is quite inspirational. Congratulations. Can you write a little
    bit about your process perhaps? What was the most difficult aspects of your design
    for instance? With such a large character set in that many cuts, some things must
    have been difficult to squeeze in there, yet it look so effortless."

  body: "The most difficult was to create the aesthetic of the typeface. It should
    be legible, but also unique. To choose, how these \"bent strokes\" should looks
    like. If they should be more visible, how they should bent. And also create the
    proportions of typeface (now i don\xB4t mean the ideal proportion i used for metrics,
    but the harmony of characters) that will be unique.\r\n\r\nFor these two things,
    according to other readable sans serif, the feeling from typesetting is very soft.
    I thing this is more possible to see when you print her.\r\n\r\nTo expand character
    set, or create more styles was to invest a really much into creating them. I spend
    a lot of time on every character. And be very patient."
