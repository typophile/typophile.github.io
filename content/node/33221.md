body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s time for me to ask for your comments before I forget
  this project altogether. Partly to teach myself FontLab, I\u2019ve been working
  on a modified version of Adobe Garamond Pro \u2013 so far, just the Regular. (My
  point of departure was the font that came with InDesign 2. The modified version
  is strictly for my own use, of course. But I\u2019d really appreciate feedback,
  so I can learn something.)\r\n\r\nThe only glyph outlines worth mentioning that
  I\u2019ve changed are the various \u201Cfences\u201D, ( ) [ ] { }, as shown at the
  top of page 1 of the enclosed PDF. <strong>GIF added:</strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Garamond_6069.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  prefer the traditional (?) kind of fences, with relatively even thickness. I also
  lowered these glyphs a bit so they\u2019ll look better surrounding old-style numerals.
  (It occurred to me that you could perhaps use the OT feature \u201Conum\u201D to
  adjust the vertical position, but I couldn\u2019t get it to work. I didn\u2019t
  try very hard, though, and can\u2019t remember the details.) Furthermore, I like
  to have plenty of space on the inside of these glyphs. On the outside, however,
  they\u2019re negative-kerned (-50) with the word space.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I\u2019ve
  loosened up the spacing, most importantly (1) the left sidebearings, and kerning
  with preceding r y, of the period, the comma, and other punctuation marks, also
  shown near the top of the PDF, and (2) uppercase-lowercase kerning pairs, which
  take up the rest of the PDF.\r\n\r\nAs for the latter, I first intended just to
  loosen the Ta, Te, and To pairs \u2013 which looked way too tight to me \u2013 but
  I ended up going through all the uppercase\u2013lowercase pairs and loosening most
  of them. (The specimen does include some pairs that haven\u2019t been modified,
  e.g. Hu.) \r\n\r\nWhile all the original uppercase\u2013lowercase kerning pairs
  were negative, I now have cumulatively perhaps as much positive as negative kerning.
  I\u2019ve read somewhere that kerning should generally be negative. Is this because
  fonts may be used without kerning and too loose is better than too tight? (I do
  agree with the latter principle!) I only intend to use this font with kerning.\r\n\r\nThe
  alternative would be to increase the right sidebearing of the caps in such a way
  that these kerning pairs can all be made negative or zero again. But I thought that
  for now, it would be better not to touch the sidebearings (and consequently the
  other kerning pairs involving the caps \u2013 though I suspect that these, too,
  will look too tight to me once I get to them).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also been planning
  to increase the sidebearings slightly across the board, and that\u2019s why <strong>the
  specimen has +8 tracking.</strong> Wouldn\u2019t the equivalent of this be an increase
  of 4/1000 em to the sidebearings?\r\n\r\nAs the above suggests, I generally find
  today\u2019s fonts too tightly spaced. This is most notable in the case of punctuation
  and kerning, but I also find myself using positive tracking in InDesign to give
  the text some breathing room in general; I think (hope) that this improves readability.\r\n\r\nActually,
  even many metal classics, like Bembo, look a little tight to me. I like the looseness
  of Stempel Garamond, for example. Some might argue that in that case, I should use
  Stempel Garamond, rather than trying to make the Adobe face look like it. But AGaramond
  is otherwise a good face (though it would really benefit from size variants), and
  I don\u2019t have the Stempel version.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I\u2019m also tempted
  to slightly increase the right sidebearing of e and the left sidebearing of z\u2014even
  though the tightness here might be traditional. Any opinions?\r\n\r\nDo you think
  the above kinds of changes would be too much for a job for which <em>someone else</em>
  has specified Adobe Garamond? What about the fact that the loosened version will
  take up more space?\r\n\r\nOlli\r\n\r\n<strong>Sorry:</strong> the first PDF was
  flawed (wrong spacing); corrected version posted Saturday at about 4:50. I also
  now realize that I haven't actually changed the v. w. v, w, pairs \u2013 but I think
  I should.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks so much for your comments, Tim! I thought I wasn't getting anything
    at all.\r\n\r\n\"the square brackets are not very well drawn\"\r\n\r\nAgreed.
    I deliberately left them pretty rough, partly just to see what people would say.
    But their roughness is quite accidental, really, which is probably not a good
    thing \u2013 and in any case, I guess it clashes with the otherwise polished outlines
    of the face.\r\n\r\n\"the kerning between 9) is not taking into account the curved
    back of the 9\"\r\n\r\nActually, there's no kerning here in either the original
    or the modified version. But I agree that the combination looks too loose in the
    modified one (so I should perhaps add a pair for this).\r\n\r\n\"The Mil of the
    modified doesn\u2019t work as well\"\r\n\r\nWell, I sort of feel that caps need
    their space; but you might be right, now that I look at the combination. (The
    original Mi is -12, the modified -8.) I have to say that as I was modifying the
    kerning pairs, they just kept looking too tight; maybe I did go too far!\r\n\r\nWhat
    do others feel?  I would appreciate it very much if you took at least a quick
    look at the PDF (as unpolished as it is). But all comments are welcome!\r\n\r\nOlli"

    them out of character with the face. Slimbach''s are good. If anything, I would
    fatten Slimbach''s vertical on the bracket, though the skinniness in your showing
    might just be a screen artifact.   '

  body: "William, my GIF is not good. In the font, both my parentheses and my brackets
    are 49 units thick, while Slimbach\u2019s parentheses are 66 units and brackets
    53 units at about the vertical middle.\r\n\r\nLooking at the PDF now, I feel that
    if anything, both my parentheses and my brackets are too thick (but I guess I
    was worrying that they might lose in legibility if I were to make them thinner).
    <strong>Edit:</strong> Perhaps the brackets should be thinner than the parentheses
    (because their rectangular shape makes them visually stronger).\r\n\r\nI do have
    a lot to learn, though. Could you maybe take a look at the PDF and then say what
    you think?"

  body: "Ok, I looked at the PDF. I think Slimbach's parentheses and curly braces
    are fine. I don't particularly like the way he's handled the right angle bits
    on the brackets, but there's nothing terrible about it. \r\n\r\nI still think
    your monoline versions are out of character with the face, and worse than what's
    already there. There is something to be said for these non-alphabetic characters
    to be somewhat different visually than alphabetic characters, but the 'fences'
    already distinguish themselves by their length. \r\n\r\nOn your revised kerning.
    Though I am generally a big admirer of Slimbach's work, I do feel he has a tendency
    to overdo tightness in kerning, particularly with punctuation. So, yeah, in principle
    I like your approach better, but I'd have to see it in print, in context, to really
    judge. "

  body: "\"I still think your monoline versions are out of character with the face,
    and worse than what\u2019s already there\"\r\n\r\nThanks for your honesty! However,
    I would point out in my defense that the monoline form seems to be the historically
    more authentic one, though the only source for Garamond himself that I have at
    hand right now is the specimen on p. 5 of Adobe's Garamond Premier specimen book
    (and this has only the parentheses).\r\n\r\nAdobe Garamond is, of course, a modernized,
    or at least \"polished\", interpretation of Garamond's faces \u2013 but I don't
    think that it's too far from the original to have the original kind of parentheses
    and other fences. We're just used to seeing it with the now more common kind.
    \r\n\r\nBesides, Robert Bringhurst, to whom you referred above, uses monoline
    parentheses and brackets with <em>Minion</em> in the second edition (1996 printing)
    of <em>Elements</em>; see also his comments on pp. 84\u201385 of that book. (This
    was my main inspiration here.)\r\n\r\nIt's another question whether my particular
    monoline versions are entirely successful; indeed, the brackets probably do need
    to have their quirks removed.\r\n\r\n\"On your revised kerning \u2026 I\u2019d
    have to see it in print, in context, to really judge\"\r\n\r\nYes, of course.
    Judging a PDF on screen, or even in a laser printout, is hard. I fear myself (actually,
    I'm quite certain) that I haven't been completely consistent in the amount of
    kerning."

  body: ">uses monoline parentheses and brackets with Minion in the second edition\r\n\r\nI
    have that edition, too. But in the current, 'Pro' version of Minion, Slimbach
    has changed them to a stressed version. \r\n\r\nThis is a small matter, but I
    do think the stressed ones are more harmonious with the face, and nothing is gained
    by monoline ones. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, in the case of the relatively unstressed
    0 of many old style numbers, you gain by having it differentiated from the lower
    case or small caps o. But you aren't going to confuse a parenthesis with anything
    else anyway. "
