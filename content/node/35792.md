    You can see them in the Truetype Full Character Map. Just scroll down on <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fine-hand/fine-hand/win-ttf/344039/charmap.html?vid=344039&cpselect=CP2\">this

    related alternate characters. Tres Cool!\r\n\r\nNow if only I can control how
    many results I get per page when browsing foundry listings. Constantly clicking
    next is not so enjoyable.\r\n\r\nMikey"

    behaves just like the Adobe CS glyph palette as long as the font is OpenType and
    coded properly.\r\n\r\n> Now if only I can control how many results I get per
    page when browsing foundry listings.\r\n\r\nIt's on the to-do list."
