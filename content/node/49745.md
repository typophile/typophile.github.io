  pop/rock band Troubleman for over 10 years. If you want to know what we do, where
  we've been, and sample our music please visit our <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/troublemantheband\">MySpace</a>
  or <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Troubleman/8599842637\">Facebook</a>
  page. In the increasingly difficult music business the quality of your music isn't
  sufficient enough for a breakthrough and a band needs all the help it can get.\r\n\r\nNow
  that our second album is out we might have a shot at something more serious. Bel-RTL
  has a new concept for Sunday nights between 9PM and midnight. Three bands are featured
  on the Bel RTL website and during the broadcast. Every Sunday the band that garnered
  the most votes will get airplay and an interview on the premier radio of the French
  community in Belgium. Troubleman was selected for the first broadcast with \"Radio\",
  so vote for us! It's simple -- just click the link below and select \"Troubleman\"
  in the list.\r\nhttp://www.belrtl.be/allaccessbelge\r\n\r\nVoting ends on Tuesday
  midnight, so there's a little over 24 hours left. Thank all of you who decide to
  help us. ;^)"

    battalion, that was an impressive army. B^)
