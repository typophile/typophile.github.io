  body: I think there was some discussion about this on Typo-L a  <BR>while ago. Search
    for it at their <a href="http://130.94.107.141" target="_blank">archives</a>.
    <BR> <BR>For emails and purposes where knowing the original URL  <BR>isn&#39;t
    necessary I use <a href="http://tinyurl.com" target="_blank">tinyurl.com</a>.

  body: One solution I saw recently was to insert the soft return <i>before</i> the
    period. Like so... <BR> <BR>blah blah blah website at www <BR>.typophile.com blah
    blah blah <BR> <BR>It seems odd to begin a line with a period, but it prevents
    the reader from thinking that the sentence ends with &#34;www.&#34;

    15th edition. Also suggested is no hyphens when line breaks are needed since many
    URLs contain dashes. '

  body: 'I usually work around the problem in the magazines I design: <BR>I remove
    all the URLs from the main text blocks and replace  <BR>them with a visual reference
    &#40;symbol, word in contrasting colour,  <BR>reference number...&#41;. Then I
    put all these URLs with a short line  <BR>of explanatory text in a separate text
    block that can run over  <BR>two or more columns. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if
    I&#39;m making myself clear, but I&#39;ll try to post  <BR>an example tomorrow.'
