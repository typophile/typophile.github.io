body: "I'm trying to identify or find close substitutes for three fonts from a series
  of computer books from my childhood.  Specifically, I'm interested in the title/heading
  font, the body text font, and the code font from Compute!'s First Book of Commodore
  64.  Pictures follow.\r\n\r\nThe heading font, from the cover, chapter heading,
  and section heading:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heading_font_3_4641.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heading_font_2_5278.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heading_font_1_5943.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  text font, with examples of quotes, numbers and boldface:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/text_font_5264.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  code font, with examples of numbers (note the 0 with the line through it), uppercase
  and lowercase letters (lowercase code is very rare in this book, and may not even
  be the same typeface):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/code_font_6084.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/code_font_lc_4927.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  particularly interested in the code font, since it's the one that gives me the warmest
  fuzzies, and also seems to be the hardest to find a substitute for.  Compute! always
  used a Selectric-like typewriter font for Commodore 64 program listings, and for
  some reason used uglier dot-matrix-style text for listings for other computers.
  \ I don't know how these books were typeset, but I wouldn't be surprised if the
  code sections were imaged from the output of the actual machines connected to certain
  printers (but I could be totally wrong about that).\r\n\r\nThanks for any assistance
  you can provide!\r\n\r\n-- Dan\r\n"

    code font, sorry.

  body: "The font on the cover is \"ITC Avant Garde\". The chapter headings are in
    \"Antique Olive\". I'm not positive on the text but it appears to be \"Palatino\"
    (judging from the \"P\"). The code font seems to be your standard \"Courier\",
    though it looks like they might be using a slashed \"O\" instead of the zero (I
    think in the version of Courier I have the alternate zero has a dot inside of
    it, not the slash).\r\n\r\nHope this helps!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Whoops! Looks like maxgraphic
    beat me to it."

  body: The code was probably printed on a daisy wheel printer. Magazines back then
    usually used a standard daisy wheel for their code. A few even used ribbon print
    for code samples. A had an Epson with that very same font and I remember doing
    a copy replace to add a backspace and slash to all the zeros for some reason.
    I don't know if print wheels had a slash on the zero.
