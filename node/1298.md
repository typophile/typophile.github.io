  body: 'It looks nice, but I think it&#39;s too cursive. <BR>Some quick comments:
    <BR>- s is wide and dark, and needs more slant; <BR>- keep the k&#39;s leg aligned
    to the baseline; <BR>- m is narrow; <BR>- make a double-storey g; <BR>- abdpq
    are too light comparing to hmn.'

  body: 'This is marvelous! Roman and italic. <BR> <BR>Things to look at in the italic:
    <BR> <BR>- The &#34;s&#34; The pen angle is too flat. <BR>- Look for consistency
    in your modulation. ie the s, e, c -vs- p, m, n. &#40;I&#39;d say thin down the
    s, e, c etc&#41; <BR>- You&#39;re poothooks/serifs, could use a bit of thinning.
    <BR> <BR>I guess that&#39;s the main thing apart from your s. Pick a thin extreme
    and stick with it! Great stuff. <BR> <BR>Randy'

  body: 'This is really nice! It dances on the page, but it&#39;s a great stylistic
    match to the roman. The two glyphs that don&#39;t seem to work are the &#34;g&#34;
    and &#34;s&#34;. <BR> <BR>But there&#39;s a problem: in a body of roman it&#39;s
    not standing out enough. You can either increase the slant &#40;although I personally
    like gentle slants&#41;, or make it lighter &#40;slightly&#41;, or narrower &#40;first
    choice&#41;, or give it a slightly smaller x-height - or of course a combination
    of those. <BR> <BR>Keep it up! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Eduardo. <BR> <BR>I still think the stroke contrast is inconsistant. Your
    serifs &#40;cant remember if that&#39;s what they&#39;re called in this case&#41;
    seem thick. compared to where your banches join &#40;n,m etc&#41; also, on the
    s, looking better, but still make the thins thin! It&#39;s making the color spotty.
    Sparkle yes. Spotty, no. <BR> <BR>Good Luck -- Randy

  body: The bowl of the g might look better if it went below the baseline- already
    evident in the q.  In text, next to the r, looks a bit small...

  body: Hi Eduardo. <BR> <BR>Nice improvements! The color looks more even when printed
    than it does on screen. I have that same problem. Hinting novice. <BR> <BR>Hope
    you don&#39;t mind but I took the liberty of doing a quick suggestion for your
    <b>s</b> in photoshop. In my opinion, you need to take the weight out of the curves
    and put it into the spine. It matches the other characters in the italic better.
    In the roman it&#39;s ok to have less weight in the spine, more in the curves.
    Here it looks clunky. Again very quickly done in photoshop. <BR> <BR>This looks
    really nice! <BR>I&#39;d say you are pretty close. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy
