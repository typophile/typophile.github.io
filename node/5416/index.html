<div class=commentbody>good to have you back, hrant! and thanks for the encouraging words. i've had to rethink my strategy (a glyph a day) but it was fun to think i could do it for a while. anyhow i've roughed out the basic gist of the lc, and taken this in a different direction than i chose for my first w. i wanted the characters to be a little more "inkey" and "gooey" but i still want it to be pretty clean. the character with the best "polish" in the following example would definately be the a (the short one) i've worked a bit on the n and the u by straightening out the verticals, but they need a lot more attention. anyhow, i guess right now i wanna find out if i'm going in the right direction. whaddya think? hope to hear from somebody... anybody... <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif align=left alt=application/x-shockwave-flash>more ruff work for critique<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Untitled-1-40895.swf target=_blank><b>Untitled-1.swf</b></a> (8.5 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody>gosh, that was fast! is "charm" like "cute" in that it's a kiss of death? ;^) <br> <br>i'm forever indecisive and am thinking of cleaning this up a bit more for what i wanted, making an more polished version with straighter verticals and an extra crisp version, although that seems kinda outta character for a "bastard" script. i just love these letterforms tho... <br>and i'm having fun with OT features like with the "with" and "that" ligs.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was in Vienna last week, and while I was walking around somewhere, I saw this old Pokemon thing that said "Pikachu, I choose you!" I just broke out laughing, because I thought "Oh man, Pikachu is so yesterday!"* <br> <br>Then I immediately thought, I need to change my typophile icon to Pikachu. Can't explain why, but I couldn't get the idea out of my head for the rest of the vacation. <br> <br>Rest assured, I will change it in the not too distant future. <br> <br>How is Adam coming along? <br> <br> * Being so yesterday made this a perfect match for Viennna. I've never been in a city that was so about yesterday in my whole life. I don't think that Vienna could fake contemporary to save its life.

<div class=commentbody>Paul, I've picked Adam to represent the Blackletter category on the first-ever Typophile <a href=http://typophile.com/node/14678>Critique Thursday</a> beacause I think the design is wicked cool.
I also hope that you have done more of it, and that you'll show it off, finish it, and release it.
The world probably doesn't *need* such a font, but I want to see it have one more anyway!
So?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, the Village Hebrew type you mentioned above is <a href=http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/Kaas/mudTyper+Weights/>Kaas</a>. It isn't really a Hebrew typeface per se, rather a big OpenType font with Hebrew characters in it as well. Most of the glyphs are Latin. All in all, I like [[Kaas]]. Maybe you'd like to discuss it in an additional thread? I'd like to keep this on track, mainly because Paul had better finish <strong>Adam</strong> as soon as possible if he knows what's good for him ;-)
[moderator's message]I'd like to encourage everyone to keep talking about <strong>Black Pearl</strong> as well—but please, in its own thread. You can go there via <a href=http://typophile.com/node/15888>this link</a>![/moderator's message]</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, when I made that post Kaas wasn't released yet, so I didn't call it by name. But I don't understand you calling it "not a Hebrew typeface", just because it also has scripts beside Hebrew. Is my Nour&Patria neither Armenian nor Latin?
BTW, in another thread I said that a Hebrew blackletter was a good,
needed thing, but I thought you said it was "insulting" or something.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, I assume that [[Kaas]] is being primarially marketed to Latin users and as a Latin typeface. Inasmuch, it isn't a "Hebrew" typeface, per se. Although I'm sure that you can set excellent Hebrew display strings with it (disclaimer, I cannot weigh in pro or against the design of these Hebrew glyphs. I know too little about the writing system :-( ).
It is just like I wouldn't call [[Helvetica Linotype]] a Hebrew typeface, even though John Hudson included Hebrew into its character set. Helvetica Linotype is a Latin face that can also set Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic. Or maybe it is a global face that can set Latin (even Vietnamese!), Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic. But the main focus & audience of the font isn't Hebrew (disclaimer, I cannot weigh in pro or against the design of these Hebrew glyphs. I know too little about the writing system :-( ).
Yes, I must have posted somewhere that I find the idea of Hebrew blackletter distasteful. I love Blackletter, and I love Hebrew, but I wouldn't ever mix the two, personally. Maybe there is someone who can pull that off—maybe Kaas does it—but the "idea" just doesn't sit well with me. I'd rather not go there.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry about the late response (I just came across this discussion).
<em>Yes, I must have posted somewhere that I find the idea of Hebrew blackletter distasteful.</em>
To each their own I guess, but if blackletter was good enough for Gutenberg, who was jewish by the looks of things, why so squeemish? </div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't see how the idea of "primarily" (<cite>especially</cite> in terms of marketing) is useful here. Nour & Patria is meant as a "multi-balanced" system for both scripts (which I would argue is the ideal), and it's marketed (well, maybe not yet) to whoever wants to use whichever of its components (including the subordinates as stand-alones). Does that mean it's neither Armenian nor Latin?! :-/
That said, maybe calling Kaas a "Hebrew typeface" can be
confusing; but really, that's just a terminological issue.
You can set blackletter Hebrew in it - that's what counts.
> the “idea” just doesn’t sit well with me.
Maybe that's why you're having a terminological gallstone? :-)
Maybe you even wish it didn't have Hebrew in it?
I hope the designer shows up.

Good morning!
Wow, I haven't ever heard this before. Can you point me to the scholarship that has lead you in this direction? That would be something for conspiracy theorists, all right…
…and here I thought all along that Gutenberg was so interested in making money from the Catholic Church because he had to face the harsh reality of having a Patrician father and commoner mother (both of who, I had also always assumed, were Catholics as well…), and therefore got to grow up in the midst of Mainzer aristocracy, without getting to be an aristocrat himself :(</div>
