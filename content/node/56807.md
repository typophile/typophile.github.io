  Moving Rubber product line. I can't quite figure out what typeface they're using
  for the English. Also, if anyone knows which Kanji font they're using, it would
  be appreciated, but I don't expect that answer to come easily. :)\r\n\r\nHere are
  some samples of the images and the last one is the type isolated and rotated, which
  still wasn't recognized by WTF.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nSean\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/copy_spiky_3889.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/copy_shake_4671.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/copy_mat_4680.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/copy_air_6743.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spiky_wtf_4449.jpg]"

    Myriad) just squooshed weirdly."
