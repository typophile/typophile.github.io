    design reminds me of DIN (various foundries)."

  body: "To me, this typeface seems to be unique. There are some commercial faces
    - I don't know their names - that look like the lower-case, having eccentric curved
    parts. (Looking around, I couldn't find what I was thinking of quickly. UNicod
    Sans, Fast Food, and Sommet Rounded were as close as I could get, which wasn't
    very.)\r\n\r\nBut except for one or two letters like J, the upper-case looks like
    News Gothic. I don't think that anyone else has tried to mix such different styles
    in one typeface."
