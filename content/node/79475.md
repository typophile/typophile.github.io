  want to find the right period fonts to use. I was wondering if anyone can tell me
  what font is for \"Old Guys Rule\" in this beer label graphic?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: If anyone is interested here is the [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/A-Love-Affair-with-Old-Things/1048719|beer
    label]] I made (it's Gator Lager). I'm not sure how to post a link here so if
    this doesn't appear or isn't clickable, my apologies.
