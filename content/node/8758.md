body: Is there a key combo for the ff ligature? I know option-shift-5 for fi and option-shift-6
  for fl. Are their any others?

  body: Christoper - <BR>Access to further ligatures are dependent on both their inclusion
    and placement by the type designer. If they have been included then you can look
    them up through Key Caps and find the corresponding keystroke. Any ligatures beyond
    fi and fl are small typographic gifts.

  body: Thanks. I realized the second I posted that I had an old friend called key
    caps. This is my second bonehead post this week. Apologies. <BR> <BR>Are you the
    same Eric Olson who did the Architects and Heroes identity?

  body: Even better than Keycaps is the ITC Character Chooser. Displays every glyph
    in a given face at 18 and 36 points, and lets you copy and paste the characters
    into another program. It also shows the key combination.  <BR> <BR>Hmmm... seems
    they&#39;re calling it the Fontek Character Chooser these days. Don&#39;t let
    that dissuade you from downloading this utility. <BR>&#40;Mac OS9 only, as far
    as I know.&#41; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/support/utilities.asp?sid=HM6THHFVJQTL9KQ5RCRJVUKSPD9FCET7&amp;sec=sup"

  body: If you&#39;re a Mac user, you should look at PopChar &#40;OS 9&#41; or PopChar
    X. This is one of my absolute must-have utilities; I&#39;ve been using it since
    the early 1990s. PopChar installs a little icon in your menu bar, whose menu shows
    every character in the selected font. All characters are shown in the actual typeface,
    and at the size you selected in your preferences. If you&#39;re typing and forget
    or don&#39;t know a particular keystroke, simply select that character from PopChar&#39;s
    menu and it will be inserted into your text just as though you had typed it. PopChar
    will also show you the correct keystroke and ASCII code in a little information
    bar, so you can learn and remember it. <BR> <BR>Since PopChar is always in your
    menu bar, you can access it from any program without leaving that program; you
    don&#39;t need to switch to another utility. <BR> <BR>Depending on the program,
    PopChar sometimes has trouble determining which font you have selected, but if
    this happens, you can manually change the font PopChar displays by using a little
    submenu. <BR> <BR>Pop Char is also very handy for simply looking at all the characters
    in a font; it&#39;s especially nice for things like expert fonts, and you can
    also explore all the keystrokes. Whenever I get a new typeface, especially if
    it has an expert set or dingbats, the first thing I&#39;ll do is look at it with
    PopChar. <BR> <BR>You can also click on a sequence of characters and have them
    set in a little text field and then cut and paste them, but it&#39;s much easier
    to simply select them directly and let PopChar set them. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.macility.com/products/index.html">
    http://www.macility.com/products/index.html</a> <BR> <BR>By the way, f ligatures
    other than fi and fl are almost always packaged in a separate font as part of
    an expert set, so you won&#39;t find them by looking in the main text font. Different
    manufacturers bundle expert sets in different ways. Sometimes there is a little
    font that just contains ligatures and other alternate characters, sometimes ligatures,
    small caps, figures for fractions, and other goodies are together, but you usually
    don&#39;t get all the f ligatures &#40;fi fl ff ffi ffl&#41; unless you buy the
    expert set.

    the main font. <a href="http://www.stormtype.com">Storm</a> certainly does, at
    least in Plagwitz and Monarchia.

  body: 'On Character Chooser and Popchar: <BR>They are both very useful. You should
    determine which works best for you. <BR>Popchar may be disturbing in terms of
    extension conflicts under Os9, while Chooser coud be used as a standalone application
    and put in the Apple menu. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve used the demo of Popchar Pro for
    OsX and it&#39;s great anyway. Try both. Character Chooser is free.'

  body: 'Ligatures: John is right, it depends on the designer, as far as we are talking
    of pre-Opentype formats. <BR>My Reality &#40;from Thirstype&#41; includes even
    an rt ligature &#40;as well as st and ct&#41;, an oddity to increase the contrast
    between the &#34;displeasing&#34; feel of the face &#40;fostered by my personal
    malaise at the time, circa 1996&#41; and my taste for classical typography. <BR>
