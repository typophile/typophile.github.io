  not a typography professional.\r\n\r\nI'm about to design a magazine-like book that
  reviews the last 2 or 3 years of my class.\r\nYou get the idea it's kind of a yearbook.\r\n\r\nMy
  question is whether it's theoretical OK to use many different fonts throughout the
  book.\r\nThe articles are about three different travels (London, Krakow and Rome)
  and i would like to theme these articles that way.\r\nThere is a lot of other content
  but i hope this gives you an idea of what i mean.\r\n\r\nThanks for your answers
  in advance,\r\nMartin\r\n\r\nP.S.: If you found any mistakes in my written English,
  you are welcome to correct me. :)"

    to buy any fonts.\r\nWe will need to stick to the fonts that are freely available,
    mostly through [[http://fontsquirrel.com|fontsquirrel.com]]. "

  body: "I think you can change the approach for each city. It'll be most successful
    if the stories run for several pages to establish each city as an individual editorial
    package. You might consider using some kind of divider (blank page, full bleed
    of solid color, etc.) as a signal to the reader that they're entering a new section.\r\n\r\nConsider
    choosing 3 typefaces (e.g., a serif, sans, slab) to use for all three cities,
    and then give each font star turn in one city. London gets the sans head, with
    the serif and slab used for body text, pull quotes, etc.; Krakow's display copy
    is set in a serif, with the other faces used in a supporting role. This approach
    gives you the desired variety for each story, but gives an identity to the publication
    as a whole."

  body: "@marcox:\r\n\r\nThanks for your answer; that was actually what i was looking
    for.\r\nI will evaluate your idea of combining the fonts differently, sounds like
    a reasonable approach.\r\n\r\nYour idea of a divider is also very nice.\r\nI really
    like the your suggestion to use a solid color, although I'm not sure if this is
    the right thing for my audience.\r\nMaybe i can combine it with some content that
    every of this articles will have (acknowledgements i.e.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince
    the book is intended to remind people of the things they experienced the content
    will be supported by a variety of photographs.\r\nMaybe i should even say the
    photographs are supported by the written content.\r\n\r\nIf you have any special
    ideas on how to implement that (or references) just let me know.\r\n(This is more
    optional since it's not what this forum is intended to do.)  \r\n"

    thought it through to the extent that Marc has!\r\n\r\nIt just seemed to be worth
    mentioning that there is a typeface family with variants named after cities, so
    I leave it to you to work out the theoretical (your word) implications of that
    for your project."
