    Presumably custom (and not a good if you want my opinion), some kind of Frankestein-font
    gathering many styles. Some letters look even like a complete failure to me.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Leigh, Maxine Sans is very good call BTW."

  body: 'Don''t know (actually don''t think) it''s on purpose. Some letters look completely
    failed, off-topic or dis-balanced conferring to the overall design a feeling of
    inconsistency, amateurism and irrelevancy... How could you imagine this movie
    is on Moses and Ramses around 1300 B.C.? I can''t. At least they didn''t use Trajan,
    Gotham, Helvetica or Papyrus (see ''Avatar''). '
