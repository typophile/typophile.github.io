  body: "Oh Yves, that seems a superficial resemblance at most. Almost no letterforms
    are close that have any earmarks at all. \r\n\r\nI wish I could say I recognize
    it. Daniela, any idea where a lot of Brazilian type originates? Those are foundries
    I would search, especially if they are not the major North American/Western European
    sources. I could easily be wrong, but this doesn't look like anything I've seen
    from our usual sources.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
