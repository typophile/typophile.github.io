body: man, im posting alot... but im new and i know you guys can come through for
  me and help me with my long-burning questions!  next up is a font that looks almost
  exactly like bauhaus 93, rather, <i>exactly</i> like it, with the only exception
  being that instead of the letters being solid, three lines together form the path
  of the original solid lines.  i&#39;m trying really hard to find a picture, but
  i&#39;ve seen this font alot of places and dont think it&#39;s just modified version
  of bauhaus 93.  i think it&#39;s used on a lot of older american eagle shirts..
  any ideas?
