body: I have several versions of Highway and Roadgeek, but it doesnt seem to be either
  one. It looks really similar though. Does anyone know what it might be. My new customer
  is redoing unit numbers on his entire fleet of vehicles and these were the only
  three digits that he had left. Any help is much appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/numbers_5349.jpg]

    (Typodermic Fonts)\r\n\r\nYou can download the current version at: \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/blue-highway-2/\r\nhttp://typodermicfonts.com/blue-highway-50\r\n\r\nThere
    was some (older?) more wide version which matches 100% your 3 letters sample,
    but I think you may also achieve a good match by expanding a bit the current version. "
