body: "I need some expert opinions on this typeface. They started off as a drawing
  for an assignment but I\u2019m now using them to learn FontLab and have decided
  I might as well see them through to the end!\r\n\r\nThey are just preliminary for
  now---an exploration of how to combine lines and shapes to form an esthetically
  pleasing glyph.\r\n\r\nBelow are specific questions, although I do have opinions
  of my own but would like to hear what others think.\r\n\r\n3 lines or 4 lines, and
  space or no space between lines and solids? As with L/C g, d, q, capitol K, E etc.
  (I think it would look best to go with 4 lines and leave no space between lines
  and solids\u2026)\r\n\r\nBetween upper & lowercase, should the line weights be the
  same mathematically or should each case have it\u2019s own particular line weight
  to balance visually?\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to some of the solids should they be consistently
  the same thickness? (E, F, I, T, L, etc. -- horizontally and/or A, N, V, W, Y, etc.--
  diagonally) This is probably a stupid question, I'm sure they should be the same
  but is there wiggle room? And lengths as well, such as E & F for sure but then what
  about the horizontals on T & L? Same as E & F?!!!\r\n\r\nShould ALL diagonals have
  the same angle? I think yes but hard to match all characters with diags--some look
  better slightly changed. Is this something one needs to juggle?\r\n\r\nWhen scaling
  down a cap, naturally the strokes change. I\u2019m guessing that I shouldn\u2019t
  be copying caps and scaling them but rather I should start from scratch for L/C
  letters? (refers to question 2)\r\n\r\nWould the descenders be better shorter as
  in F & j or longer as in g, p, q? I\u2019m thinking shorter.\r\n\r\nAnything else?\r\n\r\nAny
  advice appreciated!\r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n(The attached file is larger)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bifurstyle_5449.jpg]"

  body: "Nice, keep going !\r\n\r\nThe \"2\" should be perhaps less round, more straightforward
    in the lower part.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of licence do you have in mind for this promising
    typeface? Restrictive or more civilized (creative commons, OFL)? In the latter
    case, I would be very pround to publish your typeface in my own foundry VTF (www.vtf.fadebiaye.com)\r\n\r\nIf
    applicable, please keep us posted (vtf1554@gmail.com) :-)"

  body: "Three or four lines is a matter of preference. Your other questions though,
    they are great! You have realized the geometry might be correct, but nevertheless
    things don't look right. Trust your eyes! Do the adjustments! And do read up on
    geometric type and study actual typefaces, because there are a lot of ways to
    go wrong. \r\n\r\nYou can start [[http://typographica.org/2010/on-typography/making-geometric-type-work/|here]]."

    sizes.

    that far ahead but I'd definitely consider it.\r\n\r\nfrode: Thanks for the encouraging
    words and the great link--very informative.\r\n\r\nriccard0: This is certainly
    another thing to consider and a good point! I've already made a number of changes
    and will re-post tomorrow."

  body: "More work--more problems!\r\n\r\nNow that I\u2019m adding a 4th line my l/c
    i and l look too short/wide.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t know what to do about descender
    length, is there any rule about it matching the length of the ascenders?\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    the half-circle solids in the l/c a, b, d, g, p & q look too bulky.\r\n\r\nThis
    has a long way to go but I would love some comments on these questions as well
    as how the changes I\u2019ve made are working.\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/bifurstyle2_6640.png]"
