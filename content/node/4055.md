body: Hi Typophiles, <BR> <BR>When I started my font in 1994 I didn&#39;t know very
  much about typography. I liked the Meta &#40;not Plus at that time&#41; from Spiekerman
  and the Scala from Majoor. I was amazed by some glyph forms of both fonts. From
  that moment I started drawing characters and decided to create my own font. I have
  completed my font in 1996. &#40;I called it Delicious after Golden Delicious, an
  apple name, because I&#39;ve worked on a mac since 1992&#41;. Now when the OpenType
  font format hopefully is taking over the world, I would like to add some extra&#39;s
  to it &#40;ligatures/smallcaps etc.&#41; and maybe make some necessary changes.
  Any comments are welcome. Excuse me for my bad English writing, spelling and grammar
  and greetings from the Netherlands. <BR>  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32409.gif"

    Font with many cuts &#40;to the english speakers: how did you call the one font
    like Garamond Regular Italic? is it cuts&#41;... Guess it is the hugest family
    I see here... <BR> <BR>Some little notes: The UC &#39;O&#39; and &#39;Q&#39; of
    the Roamn &#40;guess you mean Roman :-&#41;&#41;: The Curves seams not be round,
    a little bit like a rhombus &#40;hope this is the right word&#41; <BR>Downstroke
    semi serif of the lc &#39;a&#39;: I dont know but In mine eyes goes to far. Should
    look more like lc &#39;d&#39; and &#39;u&#39; <BR>The lc &#39;s&#39; and uc &#39;S&#39;
    &#40;in any font&#41;: mhh.. looks strange but not absolutle false. Normaly the
    s is bolder in the bottom. You have mirrowed it. Dont know maybe it will work.
    Yust experience with it.. <BR> <BR>w,v,x,y of the Italics: The corner at the right
    top is nice but i guess it is to stong, maybe a smother corner will help. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Hrant gave me good advice a while back. &#34;Don&#39;t try to squeeze
    to many elements into a single design&#34; In &#34;Delicious&#34; there is enough
    peculiarities and signature elements for several fonts.  <BR>I suggest a few simplifications.
    Widths are not done. Go back and check them. I would suggest more unification
    in line weights/widths. A great concept worth refining. '

    i fell in love with your italic version. <BR>only the regular/bold sc &#34;s&#34;
    seems to fall back and the &#34;&amp;&#34; is hard to read. but overall it is
    a beautiful typeface.  <BR>

  body: I think the 9 needs to be broader at the top. I think what you did was flip
    the 6, which seems logical but compare other numerals with curves at the top and
    i think you will agree they could look more consistant. 3 hangs lower than rest.  <BR>As
    for the line inconsistencies, I think you got that problem taken care of. <img

  body: Jos -- I think the italic lc_g is too small. Does the italic lc_l rest on
    the baseline or fall below? It looks like it is resting on the baseline. I think
    it needs to drop down. Is the italic lc_o resting on the baseline? Is the uc_O
    a little to narrow in the roman? <BR> <BR>It could be the PDF, but any shape that
    rests on the baseline generally needs to fall lower to compensate to visual balance.
    If I&#39;m wrong, about the PDF ... I apologize.
