body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/-1_3975.jpg]\r\nHey guys. This is from
  a Latin-English dictionary from the 50s. I'm doing a business card for a friend
  and I want to use the two fonts in these entries. I need the bold one (the word)
  and the body font, just because I assume the body text is one font in both regular/book
  and italicized. Any ideas?"

    glance looks a lot like 'Imprint'. Or at least that would give you something very
    close!\r\n\r\nM"

    seems to have square serifs on some of the letters, while this font seems to just
    have rounded serifs. any other ideas?"

  body: "Still think it's leaning towards Imprint. Too many indicators to that font
    to ignore. \r\n\r\nThe softness of some serifs can be caused by reproduction or
    printing process. For example, if the dictionary was a reprint or resized from
    a from a smaller or larger original (shot to film), this could cause some softening
    of the image. Again if set in metal, a flong and rotary drum may have been made
    for large print volumes which would cause slight changes to the type image. Even
    an original printed from metal could effect this.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's a
    Caslon because of the large overshoot on the apex of the cap A. Also cap C in
    Calson usually (not always) has double terminating serifs. Lowercase italic g
    in Caslon is usually a little more idiosyncratic also.\r\n\r\nLook for the lowercase
    roman k. If the upper arm appears to curve somewhat, that may identify it as Imprint.
    Caslon usually has this as being straighter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps look at the imprint
    page of the dictionary also. What impression or edition is it etc.? This might
    help give further clues."

  body: 'I think Michael has it right. But frankly, the digitized versions of Imprint
    may disappoint, as they have a high contrast, and so will not have the feel of
    the letter press book. I''m prejudiced, but I think [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText|Williams
    Caslon]] captures the feel of letter press better. It is more true to Caslon proportions,
    but the alternative style with short descenders will get you closer. '
