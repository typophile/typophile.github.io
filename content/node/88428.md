  me if I'm wrong)\r\n\r\nPointy top of the upper case A when bolded\r\nPerfectly
  round O\r\nPointy downward-pointing middle bit of the M\r\nGothic kind of R with
  the diagonal stick straight and more vertical than angled.\r\nPointy ends at the
  top and bottom of the N where the diagonal joins the vertical lines.\r\n\r\nSorry
  I should know my type anatomical terms.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brandon_6552.jpg]"

  body: You've probably already thought of it, but Futura is the most popular one
    that comes to mind. Other ones to look at could be Agenda or Century Gothic. You
    also may like Nobel, but it is not as pointed as the other typefaces.
