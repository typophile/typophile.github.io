  it.\r\nIn the metrics windows when I enter the percent character into the input
  string panel, I am not getting the display. I am getting it only when I enter it
  as /percent\r\nAny idea how to rectify this?\r\nPFA image for more details \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nChaitanya"

    an entry in the Standard.nam file. on a PC, you can find the file in c:\\Program
    Files\\Common Files\\FontLab\\Mapping\\ \r\n\r\nEdit the file and insert the line\r\n0x0025
    \ percent\r\nbetween\r\n0x0024 dollar \r\n    and\r\n0x0026 ampersand\r\n\r\nThe
    line may be missing in other .nam files in that same folder (Mapping)\r\n\r\nIs
    this the same font you're having the icon problem with?\r\n\r\n- Herb\r\n"

    FontLab's windows and dialog boxes may be a function of what font is being used
    by FontLab to display text etc.\r\n\r\n - Herb"
