    such a NERD. But if my wand fails (or is due for inspection) and I have to fall
    back on using reference works Bowfins\u2019s ID Guides are sure one of my first
    choices.\r\n\r\nThanks Mike."

  body: A french people will read Couture, Torture or Corture (the last one means
    nothing in french). The C and T are really closer and could be interpretated as
    the same letter. Lot of handlettering typeface has this kind of duality.
