body: "Gerald Giampa, letterpress printer extraordinaire, former owner of the Lanston
  Type Co., pioneer in the conversion of metal to digital type, and contributor to
  Typophile, has died in Vancouver following a massive stroke. An obituary is expected
  in the Vancouver newspapers, and a wake is being planned for 31 July (location to
  be announced).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GiampaHat_6402.gif]\r\n\r\nGerald
  had many friends and colleagues who knew him better than I and for longer, so I'll
  restrict my comments to a few personal recollections and acknowledgements. In recent
  years, we had some heated disagreements and at times he expressed opinions that
  I found repellent, but the sense of gratitude I feel toward him remains. It was
  in large part due to his generosity and encouragement that I started down the path
  that led to my career as a type designer. When Ross and I met Gerald, in the early
  1990s, the Lanston Type Co. was based in Vancouver and he operated an open-door
  policy to anyone with a genuine interest in type, even neophytes like us. Gerald
  had a strong sense of historical continuity in his chosen crafts of printing and
  type founding. His office space at Lanston, with its memorabilia of Frederic Goudy
  and other former Lanston associates, embodied this continuity even as it sat next
  to the room where the Ikarus tablets were used to convert metal type designs into
  digital fonts. But digitisation was only part of the work going on. New designs
  were also being developed, notably Jim Rimmer's Albertan. Even then, the Monotype
  matrix punching and finishing machines were in occasional use, and sometimes one
  was greeted at the door by the sound of the Heidelberg presses running. By that
  time though, the customers for hot metal type and for the kind of quality letterpress
  printing that Gerald offered were few and far between. There was a sense that the
  kind of work he wanted to do was increasingly difficult to find and to justify financially.
  A lot of time was available for talking about type and printing, for looking through
  drawers and specimens, for making plans and, it must be said, for drinking. Gerald
  made no bones about his alcoholism and, as he explained, treated the wine glass
  as one more lever on the press, to be pulled in sequence.\r\n\r\nColleagues came
  to visit. Sumner Stone came, and Gerald cut metal patterns of Stone Serif, perhaps
  the first type designed for a digital medium to be back-engineered for hot metal
  setting. Dave Farey came to draw new weights for Lanson's Bodoni. It was on the
  back porch, under the grape vines from which Gerald made his own wine, that I first
  met Mike Parker, drawn to Vancouver by certain rumours regarding Times New Roman.
  When Ross and I attended our first ATypI conference, in San Francisco in 1994, it
  was with introductions to Matthew Carter and Dave Farey, courtesy of Gerald.\r\n\r\nIn
  1986, John Dreyfus visited Vancouver and paid tribute to Gerald's skill in the arrangement
  and printing of printer's flowers and ornaments. I believe Gerald cherished this
  tribute more than any other:\r\n\r\n<em>Gerald Giampa is especially original in
  his choice and combination of various coloured inks, and also in the skill with
  which he eliminates parts of a flower in order to obtain a simpler and more striking
  effect. He super-imposes colours with great subtlety, so that they blend in the
  most harmonious way. He succeeds because he plans his effects with meticulous care.
  His handling of printers' flowers combines knowledge and skill with taste and judgement.
  So my final typographical bouquet goes to the printer of these lines, to whom the
  words of the prophet Ezekiel (8:20) can be aptly applied: \u2018As for the beauty
  of his ornament, he set it in majesty.\u2019</em>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ATFCover_5296.gif]"

  body: "I knew Gerald all of two hours.\r\n\r\nI'd walked into the antique shop looking
    for metal type and wanting to see if I could gather complete alphabets from the
    little bins they had there. As I searched amongst the letters, Gerald came over
    and, upon discovering I was interested in letterpress and typography, talked with
    me about his work in letterpress and the old days. I had no idea who he was at
    the time, but his eyes lit up while telling me his stories and sharing his knowledge.
    Those two hours I spent gathering bits of metal and learning about the ins & outs
    of letterpress and making typefaces from such a great man in the industry were
    simply marvelous. Indeed I was sad to leave and hoped to return to talk to him
    again; to learn from him again. Sadly, I will never have the chance.\r\n\r\nThank
    you Gerald, for your kindness and passion to share your knowledge. It was an honor
    to meet you, even briefly, and I felt inspired by your words. Safe journeys, and
    be at peace. "

  body: "Thanks from here also, John. I'm sorry to hear this.\r\n\r\nI worked with
    Gerald about 1990 in bringing Pabst out in digital form. I used to keep the 1923
    ATF book by my desk at the ad agency where I was type director. Art directors
    would thumb through it, looking for something \"new.\" When a guy insisted Pabst
    was the \"only\" face that would work for a new Dow product, he was in luck, for
    I knew Gerald had the metal patterns.\r\n\r\nGerald offered me a ridiculously
    low price to digitize the roman, but at that date he did not know if he had the
    patterns for the italic (so we just slanted the roman in Quark; looked like hell).
    It was quite a trip. We had lots of back-and-forth about letterfit, where in the
    character set to place the special logotypes, etc.\r\n\r\nI hate that typeface,
    and I cringe when I see it, recalling that I had a hand in making it newly available
    (even though eventually it would come to life again, I suppose). But the phone
    calls and faxes (no e-mail then) with Gerald made it all worthwhile.\r\n\r\nI
    just re-read this good thread, to which Gerald made many posts (it is one of those
    to which Kent alludes above, I'm sure):\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/5303\r\n\r\nRe-read
    it all. The last post is a fitting self-eulogy for Gerald.\r\n\r\nI will raise
    a glass to him this evening (or sooner if I get lucky).\r\n\r\npowers"

    and Jim in their typographical element.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of elements, I think the
    period when I saw a lot of Gerald in the mid-90s must have been the only time
    in his life when he didn't have a boat in the water. He felt the lack keenly.\r\n\r\nTwo
    nautical (mis)adventures of which you have reminded me:\r\n\r\nGerald recounted
    sailing up to Deep Cove and spending a long lunch in the pub there before rowing
    back out to his boat, hoisting canvas and heading back down the Sound. Don't drink
    and sail. He forgot to haul in his anchor, and it dragged along behind him, catching
    the lines of several other boats and pulling them after him while their owners
    shouted from the shore in alarm.\r\n\r\nGerald and his then wife, Mary Jane, were
    living aboard a boat moored at Granville Island. They'd gone to bed for the night,
    but were alerted by a cry and a loud splash. A drunk staggering out of the Arts
    Club Lounge had tripped and fallen into False Creek. Gerald and Mary Jane rushed
    on deck to rescue him, and other drinkers emerging from the bar were greeted by
    the sight of Gerald, stark naked, hanging over the edge of the boat trying to
    keep the waterlogged man above water.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a characteristic of
    Gerald's stories that they end at the funny bit, and I never found out how the
    situations were resolved.\r\n___\r\n\r\nP22 Foundry, who purchased Lanston from
    Gerald, still host the eccentric website he made including the <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/Lanston/Giampa/GiampaTour.html\">biographical
    pages</a>. These end before his return to Vancouver from Finland.\r\n\r\n\u2018I
    started with nothing, and still have most of it left.\u2019\r\n\r\n"

    I had with Gerald in 2004 (a first: reading e-mail from a deceased person). We
    had felt a sudden kinship during some rage at Typophile and I wanted him to come
    to Stockholm (this was during the period he was living in the Finnish archipelago,
    not too far away) and give a lecture at the Typographic Guild.\r\nAnd as bold
    as some of his statements were on this site (and his own), as humble \u2013 or
    dare I say shy \u2013 was his response. He would love to, but admitted he wasn't
    much of a speaker(!) It could be one of those weeding speech intros; \"I'm not
    much of a speaker, but...\" and then go on forever, but I actually believe he
    was sincere. Not much of an ego there. Unfortunately for the Guild he soon left
    Finland for Canada. And now, onwards, upwards. Oh, well...\r\n\r\n\u0192"

    sitting next to him at dinner and enjoying some good conversation. He was hoping
    to get Adobe (my then-employer) to buy Lanston's assets, but we weren't all that
    interested (and perhaps the price was still a bit high).\r\n\r\nUnless I have
    this confused with a different Toronto type conference a few years earlier, the
