body: "The scan is attached. This is from a book published in 1993, so the typeface
  may or may not be digitized. I am looking either for either a digital version of
  this typeface, or an existing typeface which closely approximates this.\r\n\r\nWhatTheFont
  suggested Scriptorium Marquis, Marathon Serial, and Garamond. However, the line
  weights in this scan are of a more-or-less similar stroke width, ruling out the
  first two, and the capital T of Garamond has bidirectional serifs, while this has
  vertical serifs on the capital T, ruling out Garamond.\r\n\r\nI am thinking of using
  Palatino to approximate this typeface; however, Palatino has more contrast between
  thick and thin strokes than what is in the attached image. Any suggestions?"
