  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey Everyone,

I'm not sure how active this forum is? As a New Zealander I am currently doing major project, here is my central question:

The black-letter Fraktur was Germany’s national choice of typeface style, however because it was terminated almost indefinitely by Hitler in WW2 I propose this question: can validity be restored to the typeface style, fraktur, which was defaced and became an index of inhumanity?


How does everyone see the reputation of blackletter today?
- negative/positive etc


What i'm really wondering is how can i start restoring validity? How can i design a typeface that is sensitive and honouring its history? One that moves people because of the context it is placed in. My original interest in blackletter was a link through from my empathy to the victims of WW2. Is their a way i can get that kind of empathy into the blackletter? Lots of questions - do i really want to get that empathy coming through (i.e.bringing back the past), like a memorial???

		<div class="commentbody">Blackletter of course has such a rich and varied history that the whole 1933–1941 period is just a blip in its continuum. But most young Germans do not care. They seem to dislike blackletter, mostly because they want to distance themselves from the past, espcially the Nazi past. (Blackletter's hey-day, say 1450–1800, is not a period that modern Germans can associate with either. Almost nothing in their daily lives has anything to do with it. Blackletter was also highly tied up with Religion, especially the Protestant Reformation. As most young Germans are not religious, this is just one more strike against blackletter).

Fortunately, the world is much bigger! Even if the Germans never use blackletter again,* there are still plenty of other people left to like it.

I think that the reason that Blackletter isn't seen so often anymore is because almost none of the blackletter fonts available for computer users today are optimized for smaller text sizes. Note that Underware's Fakir is a new, and brilliant, exception.

An example of a modern Blackletter, distinctly British rather than fraktur though. It seems to me that to try to produce a typeface that restores validity* <em>and</em> honours history is going to be difficult, but it would be interesting to see how you propose to go about it, even if you decide that a memorial is inappropriate or too difficult to achieve.

		<div class="commentbody">Hannah, the question you ask is on the mind of many people these days.
In fact there has been extensive discussion of this topic on Typophile!
Make sure to take a short vacation and use the search function.  ;-)

Here's something small from me:
http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_fraktur1.html

Also, you wonder how Germans view blackletter today.
I think this is an important question, because they
are (mostly) the "owners" of it (although certainly
other people should, and do, make fonts in the style).

My impression is that it's still strongly negative
overall, but there are cracks now visible (including
in the German stigma over WWII as a whole) which
will probably eventually open up to reveal the light.
Politically, I think that the displeasure that many
Germans feel towards contemporary Israeli behavior
is helping this along, in an implicit way.

		<div class="commentbody">First of all...thanks everyone for the many replies!! I have had a good look around on the Typophile site and it is good to have that pool of information when it's not necessarily out in books everywhere.

<em>Blackletter:Type and National Identity and Paul Renner's book</em> have been a great kick start for my research. They are full of good information. I have briefly compared Futura and Fraktur/blackletter/ww2 in an essay. However, as the tutor pointed out, I need to consider that these are on completely opposite poles. Futura was the extreme of modernism and fraktur at the other end.

<em>Validating</em>
That is a good quesiton. My tutor actually asked me that the other day. Initially I am thinking that I want to bring a positive aspect to blackletter and something fresh compared to what it has taken on leading up to it's demise.
Perhaps it is more modernity that I'm wanting to inject(contemporary not historically). I realise this has been talked on typophile already.

The idea of a readable blackletter applicable for text use today sounds affable.

<em>Most young Germans do not care</em>
Yes, I do not know many Germans myself. Are any of you German? I spoke to a German student who is just in New Zealand for a short time. Here are his comments:

blackletter in Germany is
- very rarely seen, however...
- it is used in some modern type books
- playing with just the one single letterform
- they use the knowledge that it is old type to play around with it and use it as something completely different to the modern
- I think it is cool to bring it back to play around with but not as whole text (he must be one of the few who like??)
- they always use the very traditional, never WW2 blackletter

So it appears from above it is more of a left field art in Germany??

Validity is really what I need to crack down on.

		<div class="commentbody">hi Hannah,

your theme sounds interesting, in fact I am doing my thesis about nearly the same thing. I want to find out if Blackletter has to be always in the corner of the Nazi-Beer-tradition-skateboard-punk-corner, or if it is possible to use it in a modern way. 
Which I found strange is that the usage ranges from traditional conservative to alternative extremist. It's quite paradox.

For the use of those Naziblackletter fonts. For me it is not just that they are politically problematic, they are also of no estetic quality. They resemble the brutality and primitivity of this regime. So I wouldn't use them simply because they are one of the worst fonts ever.By the way I am german :) If you want I can share my research with you, as we are working the same field. I am also trying to focuse on how blackletter is seen outside Garmany as I feel we Germans are more delicate about those historical connotations than the rest of the world. Over all they are not german fonts they came from France, so they are really not ours...</div>

I think Underware’s Fakir could be a good example/or case study of a modernised and “validated” blackletter but as it was released only recently, we haven’t really seen if the text cuts are actually used in text sizes. I haven’t seen what it looks like *in text* but it looks good, I ordered the <a href="http://www.isnotmagazine.org/takeaway.html">type sampler</a> last week to see for myself.

><em>it does nicely help validate blackletter.</em>
In terms of actual usage throughout the world, I suspect that Fakir will get mileage on the level that FF Brokenscript did. But it wouldn't become ubiquitous as Old English,* Fette Fraktur, or Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch.

* To be fair, Old English's basic design has been in relatively constant use since 1760…</div>

In my neighbourhood (Germany/Stuttgart Süd) is much more blackletter around, as in (Hi Dan) Germany/Wiesbaden ;).
Fraktur, Schwabacher, even Sütterlin. OK, you won't find an advertisement for a new notebook set in Fraktur ;), but a lot old-style restaurants, streetnames set in fraktur, beer-labels, s.o.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Thomas, but the problem with the use of blackletter is that it exclusively limited to historic, display applications. Like the town museum in Wiesbaden's suburb, Mainz-Kastel… Its sign (Heimatmuseum) is set in Fette Fraktur. Naturally withOUT the long-s ;-0

All of the modern street signs in Mainz's historic district are set in a Textura. And of course one sees blackletter all over old buildings. And on beer and wine labels. But these things are all old, and don't speak very well to younger generations.

I do like how younger designers play with blackletter on posters and flyers. Yet I get a feeling that a lot of this is just because that sort of thing is done so much (more) in other countries.

Of course lots of young German designers are interested in blackletters. But compared with younger designers in other countries, the proportion is smaller. Blackletter was all over 1990s graphic design in Florida. And London has more blackletter throughout the city (both old and new) than anywhere in Germany (although there it is textura/old-english instead of fraktur).

Even Mexico, as is discussed elsewhere here, has more blackletter integration in the daily visual culture than Germany in 2006.

If I were to oversimply, I would say that Germany's visual culture, typographically speaking, is all about sans serif typefaces (AG, Helvetica, Univers, Frutiger, DIN, DIN again, DIN again and again, Meta, etc.).</div>

><em>Is there more blackletter in former-East-Germany than former-West-Germany?</em>

Albert Kapr wrote that the DDR (East Germany) published far more books per year in Fraktur than the West did. But I have a feeling that there is more blackletter in the open environment in the West, as West Germany rebuilt more of its old building after the war than the East Germans did.

Kapr also wrote (in 1993) that young East German designers did not associate Fraktur with the Nazis at all. This may be because they were taught history differently. And/or they hadn't had as many war movies made in the East as West Germany (and Hollywood) made.

Neo-Naziism is more prevalent now in the former East, however. They use a lot of blackletter, although they use a lot of heavy condensed sans serif type, too. Probably more than they use blackletter, even.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">><em>Is this going to be a full thesis or a dissertation supported by a body of work?</em>
It's my fourth/final year. An honours year where we I think do a kind of visual thesis you could say. We do not have to write a big final essay. Though some other departments like Industrial do have to. We started research second half of last year. Have written essays etc. Now up to the stage where we start designing through the question we have formed from all our research. End of year we have an exhibition. I didn't know anything of this topic when coming into it. Yes, with our projects, they say, they end up being big topics with much more potential to go further. Therefore, I have considered a further year of study will be very beneficial. I still greatly value your imput, thanks.

What initially captured me was that the political powers of WW2 enforced blackletter and then banned it from all printed ephemera (and this was only a typeface, but this helped show some of the extremity of the time). I have been passionate about blackletter through this background.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the division of blackletter typefaces in "WW I" and "WW II" style is not appropriate as well. It was already pointed out that blackletter typefaces have a much longer history. Also, different fraktur/blackletter faces were used during the NS regime, not only Tannenberg and its fellow 'Schaftstiefelgrotesk's. 
These are to a certain degree (and under ideologically alarming conditions) also trying to modernise blackletter. 
Political/ideological afflixion of typefaces is always a matter of context and of usage and reception in a certain (collective) disposition of perception. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think blackletter is much more than a Nazi letterform. Of course its Nazi connotations are strong, but that is just a tiny bit of its history. Blackletter existed many centuries before Hitler and hopefully will survive many more after him.

Hanna, I would suggest you to look into the letterform itself. Check out the shapes, ornaments and strokes in the letterform. I believe there is where you could find the contemporary validation you are looking for.
Blackletter has a delicate, precise anatomy. Is a very crafty and passionate letterform. Is a whole parallel universe to roman type!

I suggest you to check out: Albrecht Durer’s: Of the just shaping of letters.

		<div class="commentbody">Hannah,

There is a bunch of material that can help you make stronger links between blackletter and Sans or Antiqua forms. See the Renner biography by Burke, and also Renner's own book, "Eine Jahresgabe der Typographischen Gesellschaft". In it are many illustrations of his deliberate experiments to somehow synthesize blackletter and Antiqua forms. He approaches the idea several different ways, and manages to come up with several interesting developments. You might examine how elements of Blackletter can be incorporated or evolved to be relevant or functional in modern printing. There's also a wide continuum of forms between blackletter, Uncial and Antiqua that you could consider. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">yay! a good blackletter thread.
personally i really love blackletters of all kinds and shapes. as a jew who lived with the knowledge of the jewish holocaust (and lost a relative who was a victim of the german nazi’s actions), i still love blackletters. but i also “feel” some blackletters as “dangerous”, “brutal”, and “frightening”, and it allures me even more.
what you intend to do is important, because it’s you may bring this beautiful style to a rebirth, and clean it from the other connotations of “nazi,medieval,punk-rock,whatever”.

unfortunately, there are well known common feelings about the blackletters. however, as people said here - the black letter was the text face of culture and knowledge from the medieval age, and that cannot be ignore.

some of the blackletters faces scream “kill” or violence when you see them. but i think that there is a way for inovation, mabe if you analyse the graphic language of the styles and try to avoide it, or at least be concious of it.. if a foreign designer who has never seen blackletters before will stumble upon them, he will probably note two things which are apart or together.
1. sharp edges
2. too much detailes
3. high width contrast in the letters parts.
now i don’t want to exagarate, (i might be totaly wrong because there is a big variety). these are some of the features and qualities that are not always there, but it sums up what i was seeing. i think that some of the fraktured letters look violent, or jumpy.

in my opinion there are some readability problems. sometimes i see faces with german letters which are not so known to the non germans. other times i couldn’t understand which letter is a certain capital.

i agree with Hrant. i think that i havn’t seen many existing digitised fonts that are good for long texts, because there is a strange readability streaming problem. that is to say - the reading is not easy and flowing. there is a cavity that needs to be filled with a good modest and simple yet elegant blackletter. one that doesn’t scream, bite, or eat you, and who isn’t too much detailed.. it could be a good start to develope.

(im sorry if my english is a little hard to understand).
cheers and good luck!!

Of course I was only talking about those "schaftstiefelgrotesk"ones!
I love blackletter fonts and what the Nazis did to them was sort of a violation. Never to forget that they also shamefully used the good old ones. Unfortunately present day Neonazis have no idea which fonts where used in Nazi times, so that you can see Old Schwabacher on those fascist's shirts, which makes the image of the blackletter even worse.

Yaronimus: 

There are a lot of good and readable Blackletter, it's just they are not/ or not properly digitized yet. Take for example Unger Fraktur, a very light and gentle font.
Also I think it's a matter of custom to read those fonts.
And to forget about some letters like the long-s (I know some of you might want to kill me for this, but the long-s is to forgotten to be reintroduced) or to sligthly adjust some of the Letters that are problematic like the small k, z or the x.

For a great selection of Styles you may want to see a recently released book (sorry only in German, but there's not too much text to read) named "Fraktur mon amour" editor is Verlag Hermann Schmidt.
It comes also with a cd with some free fonts.
Sadly the free ones are of the worst quality I ever saw. But at least it's free and there are some pretty rare ones on it.</div>

Even more unfortunately, present day non-Neonazis
have no idea that blackletter does NOT equal Nazi.  :-/

The thing is, blackletter <cite>is</cite> very strongly (if not entirely) German, and the many people who equate -or at least strongly associate- Germans with Nazis* will have an especially hard time getting over blackletter's stigma. Not that these types of people generally <cite>want</cite> [us] to get over it to begin with.

* Such as Sarah Silverman, who jokes that "schadenfreude"
means "Look, that Jew fell down" in German. But of course
some people are allowed to be racist. In the US, they might
even get applause if it's the right kind.

I totally aegree, I like the long-s too.
I just wanted to say that if Blackletter is used in our days, especially outside Germany it will not be understood, so we (type addicts) know it should be there, but for the sake of understanding and readability we just don't use it. After all typography is to be read and understood and such letterforms don't help it anymore.
Originally the long-s served also to structure words better.
You can find it also in some Antiqua fonts, it was not a special Blackletter character.

If the history of blackletter would be a part of education, there were  less klischees and beside the "the good old times, heavy metal/punkrock/hiphop and nazifont" something else. There was/is a total ignorance in the field of education, that leads to prejustices and dumb klischees (Same old story: Yesterday i saw a reportage in german TV about soccer-hooligans visualised with a blackletterfont...)

And we surely need some new designed blackletter textfaces to check out what is possible.

YARONIMUS-MAXIMUS
Thanks heaps for your comments on blackletter. The notion of cleaning blackletter or bringing a positive light (away from the traditional, alternative subcultures, nazi's etc) is exactly what i'm wanting to do!


Question (to all): Would you agree that blackletter has not been the same since WW2 and there after?


(There is so much to comment on...I will gather my thoughts and post again)


ANOTHER Question (to all): What are your views specifically on the blackletter letterforms and their structure? Even if you love blackletter, is there anything that doesn't sit right for you in the modern context of today?</div>

I'd buy it.

I think Hrant's observations about the divergence of forms (on his website) helping recognition is what makes blackletter attractive. Or at least it makes me curious about what new ways type designers might look at it. And now his comment about modernism has got me thinking too.</div>

That is a very interesting and unique modernised blackletter.
Definitely here it has been used as a display font, but I can't tell if it has been used for the text titles?
They are kind of awkward shapes yet they still seem to work well together, perhaps because I'm not used to seeing this kind of display font. 
The numbers I like the best. Their rounded edges remind me alot of the bauhaus below.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bauhaus_3480.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Brussel_02_5138.jpg]

The designer has taken the broken and angled characteristics of blackletter and made a feature out of them in this typeface. I really like the idea of doing it that way, makes it a bit simpler anyway. I wonder what inspired them?

Placing the blackletter with the pink (contemporary use of colour) also makes it more modern and friendly.

They are still quite quirky letterforms however, and perhaps that's something of blackletter that will always be seen when made today? Maybe?</div>

He incorporated those "shears" into the curves as a way to implement trapping stylishly, but until people (including myself and at least one other person) pointed it out he didn't realize that he was giving the font a blackletter feel! And it's quite interesting that Weltin is German...

		<div class="commentbody">I think there's movement towards acceptance of blackletter again, even if it occurs through its resemblance to fraktur faces. If you've been following so-called 'urban' graphic and fashion design in the US and UK during the last year, it's en vogue to use intricate graphic silhouettes, often coupled with display type in fraktur and copy in a clean sans face. The visual cues between the illustrations and the type are frequently the angled 'cuts' and the high contrast you speak of. 

Of course, the prevalent style is closer to that you identified as contemporary to WW1, but the groundwork is being laid.</div>

It's an artefact of chirography, but it could be many other things too,
and you don't need to be thinking chirographically in implementing it.
The same with many other things, like stroke contrast. Legato has it, but
certainly not because Evert was a fan of chirography - quite the opposite.

I think the "shears" can enhance the formcontrast of the single letterform, maybe that's why Jürgen Weltin did that here. And furthermore it can increase the "dynamic impression". Quite interesting example.

<cite>To me the most effective way of re-validating blackletter would
be to make a text font, one that's subtle enough to go unnoticed
by laymen readers.</cite>

While I am dubious about the prospects of blackletter, I highly agree with this. I suspect that such a type couldn't <em>really</em> be a blackletter, but I do think that at least non-Roman text/calligraphic type of some sort - such as rotunda - can and should be validated in this way.

Ultimately, there should be more basic models for readable types to work from as a starting point than simply Roman and sans-serif. (Clarendon, slab-serif, and Latin (wedge-serif), in my view, hardly count as departures from those two basic types, just as sub-types.)</div>
