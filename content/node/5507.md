  body: Peter,  <BR> <BR>&#62; I was stupid enough to think that this  <BR>&#62; would
    link them immediately, and that I  <BR>&#62; didn&#39;t have to define the right
    and  <BR>&#62; left classes in the kerning assistant.  <BR> <BR>You need to define
    the left and right classes in Kerning Assistance. The simplest case is to open
    Kerning Assistance, click on the left classes list, click on &#34;Select All&#34;,
    click on the right classes list, click on &#34;Select All&#34;. That&#39;s a 5-seconds
    job.  <BR> <BR>Then, you can go and manually deselect the appropriate side of
    the class for those that are noth both-side classes &#40;if you have such classes&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>&#62; Why isn&#39;t there a feature in FL that  <BR>&#62; does connect the
    accent characters  <BR>&#62; automatic &#40; with an option to turn it  <BR>&#62;
    off&#41;?  <BR> <BR>This can be done with a Python script. Such script is in development
    at Fontlab Ltd. and will be available as an add-in for FontLab Studio 5.  <BR>

  body: Thank you Adam for you quick answer. <BR> <BR>&#34;That&#39;s a 5-seconds
    job.&#34; <BR> <BR>Usually I prepair these things in advance but it couldn&#39;t
    be done this time. The font is a bit special so usual kerning pairs doesn&#39;t
    apply. That&#39;s why I hoped to keep the kerning pairs I&#39;ve made in FOG &amp;
    just apply the same settings to the diactritics - AccentKernMaker would&#39;ve
    done the trick.  Making right classes will take a while &#40;long time&#41; in
    this case. Maybe I should just print the atm- file and go through which pairs
    need to be fixed? <BR> <BR>&#34;add-in for FontLab Studio 5. &#34; <BR>Looking
    forward to it&#39;s release... many nice features. <BR>

  body: Peter,  <BR> <BR>make up just a few classes, then save the classes into an
    .flc file from the Classes panel. Open the .flc file in a text editor. You will
    see that the font has a fairly simple structure. Of course the other classes still
    need to be added, but editing this text file should be fairly fast.  <BR> <BR>Note
    that in the Kernig Assistance dialog, you are also able to save a .flk file which
    has a similar structure but in addition contains information on left-side, right-side
    and both-side classes. So perhaps you may want to edit this one.  <BR> <BR>Best,  <BR>Adam
