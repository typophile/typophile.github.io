    Closest other choices (out of many with a similar feeling) were [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/eyeful/|Eyeful]]
    from Pizzadude, and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sylvestre/mickster/|Mickster]]
    from Mick Sylvestre.\r\n\r\nIf Lex is right, and this is a free font, search Cartoon
    or Comics categories at Dafont.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
