    Problem is that it works a lot for the logo, but not as an identity font, it rather
    difficult to read when you are driving fast. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42714.gif"
    alt=""> <BR>I would also cut the &#34;a&#34; spike, this way it seems more like
    a recent font <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
