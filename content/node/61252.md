body: "Hello Guys et Dolls: \r\n\r\nIn the fabulous FAQ section on the H&FJ foundry
  website we learn of five fonts that have \u201Cweight duplexed\u201D tabular numerals.
  These are highly useful for financial reports and statements (as they\u2019ve mentioned),
  however; wouldn\u2019t we also find this valuable for creating resumes, invoices
  and even cookbooks? \r\n\r\nYes, of course. We love the optically perfect\u2014both
  horizontally and vertically!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/ask/recentTopic.php?rtID=90\r\n\r\nArcher\r\nChronicle
  Text\r\nGotham\r\nMercury Text\r\nWhitney\r\n\r\nSurely, these select H&FJ types
  aren\u2019t the last word in fonts that allow you to mix bold and regular weights
  without repagination.\r\n \r\nIf you know of the other fonts or foundries that have
  this highly desirable feature please spill the beans.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

  body: "Different concepts. <em>Grades</em>, at least as defined as H&FJ, are slight
    weight variations on a single weight, usually used for optimizing the quality
    of text on different papers or presses. <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/PoynterOSText/styles\">Poynter</a>
    is another example.\r\n\r\nH&FJ is defining a family with <em>duplexed weights</em>
    as one that shares the same width among all its weights. Other families like this:\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "Well, grades are designed, according to H&FJ, \"using the same set of character
    widths, so designers prototyping with one font can switch grades later without
    affecting copyfit.\" So, yes, typefaces with grades have weight duplexing, albeit
    in smaller increments than a typical roman and bold, for example.\r\n\r\nIf I
    understand your question, I don't think you'll find many typefaces that are duplexed
    between weights (rather than grades), since that would really mess-up the spacing
    in many cases. Some monospaced faces are duplexed between weights, and if you
    look for unaltered digital versions of Linotype faces you'll find duplexed italics,
    e.g. in <a href=http://www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html>Sabon</a>. Another
    type family that's duplexed is the delightful <a href=http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/klimax>Klimax</a>."

    Change the weight, line length is unchanged. Don't recall if it has tabular digits
    or not though.
