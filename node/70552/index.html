  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m new to this forum and I wanted to ask a question of the more experienced typophiles out there. I was recently involved in a discussion over at MyFonts, where a font was identified as Pinto Inline, an undigitised font by Graphic Systems (that&rsquo;s what it says in my catalogue anyway).</p>
<!--break-->
<p>A user asked for the full set of characters, which I subsequently scanned, badly, from a Mecanorama catalogue I had lying around, and uploaded to my Photobucket account.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;d really like to scan that font properly, along with a few other obscure, not digitally available ones from that catalogue, and upload them just for the reference of those font lovers out there who&rsquo;d like to see them, many of them have been identified at WhatTheFont from scans, logos and the like, but I&rsquo;m worried that I might be inviting trouble. One the one hand, I think they should be seen, but on the other hand I don&rsquo;t want unscrupulous folks coming in, digitising them and running away with the credit. The catalogue itself isn&rsquo;t even dated, some of the fonts are credited to people or foundries, some aren&rsquo;t, I assume Mecanorama owned those, though I&rsquo;m not sure. Should I scan and share with as much credit and copyright info as I can, or should I leave them in my bookcase to gather dust, just in case? I feel kind of bad having this record here on my coffee table and not being able to share it with anyone, but on the other hand, I don&rsquo;t want to be doing anything that verges on illegality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d welcome any advice. Thanks.</p>

Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like the idea of making it available to the public domain, but you&rsquo;ll probably need approval from Mecanorma/designers/foundries. Having said that, I would love to see them! I&rsquo;m a big fan of old-style Mecanorma and Letraset type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&rsquo;t really know, that&rsquo;s the problem. Is an image of a font a font or an image? If someone posts a scan of a complete character set to WhatTheFont and asks me what font it is and where they can buy it, which has happened in the past few days, and I tell them what font it is, and that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not digitally available but it was designed by so-and-so in the year such-and-such, what has actually happened in that exchange that would differ from me posting a complete character set to a blog and saying &ldquo;Hey, I like this font, it was designed by so-and-so in the year such-and-such, shame it hasn&rsquo;t been digitised.&rdquo; Would either of us be infringing copyright? Should I refrain from doing that? I&rsquo;m not even really that worried that people/foundries would jump on me for copyright, but that someone would take the image and run with it and do a Creampuff, as it were, and that that would be my fault.</div>

it‘s not about the font’s copyright, but the catalogue’s copyright.

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m not looking to reproduce the catalogue itself, though, or even pages from the catalogue or any of its layout. Just 8 or 9 fonts from a collection of 300 from the one section in the catalogue that deals with font transfers, just the A-Z 1-0 characters, nothing else on the page. Copyrightwise, wouldn&rsquo;t they be classified more or less as &ldquo;underlying work&rdquo; in an anthology, as it were?</div>
