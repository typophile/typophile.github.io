body: "Is there an official font used on Snellen eye charts?  I've seen both serif
  and sans serif versions, but the serif versions seem more widespread, at least based
  on online image searches.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of serif chart: \r\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e7/Snellen06.png\r\n\r\nRockwell?
  \ Or is there something closer?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the sans serif versions, online
  images of these are harder to find.  But they remind me of BankGothic Lt BT, although
  I'm pretty sure that's not it.\r\n\r\nExample of sans-serif chart:\r\nhttp://pro.corbis.com/popup/Enlargement.aspx?mediauids={87b2fd54-3495-426c-8400-9280e50bf723}|{ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff}&qsPageNo=3&fdid=&Area=Search&TotalCount=472&CurrentPos=25&WinID={87b2fd54-3495-426c-8400-9280e50bf723}\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart\">wikipedia</a>,
    These aren't ordinary fonts (with only 9 characters), they appear to be custom
    designed so the black balances with the white (notan? :^P) and the body height
    and width is five times the width (or thickness) of a stroke. \r\n\r\nThe sans-serif
    chart example appears to be <a href=\"http://www.thomson-software-solutions.com/user_updates.html\">this</a>
    font.\r\n\r\nThe slab does bear a resemblance to Rockwell but I'm sure it is not."

  body: "Don't know the official typefaces. Judging by the vertical symmetry, lack
    of overshoots on the rounds (O,C), and tiny bowls (D,P) it seems clear that the
    slab version at least was made by scientists, doctors, or engineers -- not type
    designers. These are my closest matches:\r\n\r\nSerif: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/stymie_com_medium/?sample_text=EFPTOZLD&sample_size=74\">Stymie
    Medium</a> beats <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/rockwell_by_adobe_std_roman/?sample_text=EFPTOZLD&sample_size=74\">Rockwell</a>
    mainly because of the width and it's shorter E,F crossbars.\r\n\r\nSans: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/sackers_gothic_std_heavy/?sample_text=PNXCASLGRK\">Sackers
    Heavy Gothic</a>"

  body: I've actually always thought those eye charts used characters that had unfairly
    small bowls and counters. Kind of like when you see a sign for the fire department
    "F.D." but the period after the F is too tightly kerned and it causes it to look
    like it says "ED." ("Who's this Ed guy and why does he get to park here?")

    interpretations of the old stuff.
