  body: "Generally, \"figures\" and \"numbers\" are synonymous AFAIK.\r\n\r\nI don't
    quite understand your second question. Are you asking for three separate definitions?
    If so, I'd suggest that probably the first two are properly \"alternate glyph\"
    and \"arabesque,\" while the last might be an abbreviation for \"boldface.\"\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

    according to Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nI suppose that <strong>BF</strong> stands for \"Bold
    Face.\"\r\n\r\nComiccraft's <a href=\"http://www.comicbookfonts.com/fonts/BL/catalog.html?item=fonts:bl035&sid=0001MgaD9t6hSLgdxg6F6p7\"><strong>Mild
    Mannered</strong></a> is a font that has alternate characters for each uppercase
    letter... Notice, for example, how there are two slightly different versions of
    the capital <strong>S</strong> in the word \"TRUTHINESS\"... Alternate characters
    are especially useful in a handwriting or handlettering font. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/info/opentype-advanced-typography/\">OpenType</a>
    technology allows for many alternate characters, among other things.\r\n\r\nThe
    terms \"Arabic figure\" and \"Arabic number\" probably refer to the same thing...
    although I am more familiar with the term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals\"><strong>Arabic
    numerals</strong></a>.\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Ack, Thomas beat me to the punch.  :-)"
