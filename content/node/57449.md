  the email we included the measurements of 180x300mm.\r\nNow, I got a call back from
  the printer telling me my supplied \r\nartwork wrong. He told me It is portrait
  and not landscape as stated \r\nin my email. \r\n\r\nApparently in printing it is
  always Y before X. \r\nWell, that is in New Zealand. I studied and worked\r\nin
  Switzerland and it was always X before Y.\r\n\r\nI thought about the whole scenario
  and I'm wondering\r\nif there is any reason for that? Something traditional? \r\nor
  printers hate math?"

  body: "That's been my experience - a 14' x 48' billboard's specs are given as 48'
    x 14' - really screwed me up a few times. It's true down to smaller signage -
    duratrans and such (although it's not completely consistent) - my print production
    manager is great and knows to check if something seems suspicious.\r\nMagazines,
    newspapers, etc. are the way you would expect.\r\n\r\nMy experience with signage
    is that they deliver the worst specs I have ever seen - bad math on scaling (most
    billboards are done in what they call 1/4 scale - which is actually 1/4\" = 1'
    - which I would correctly call 1/48 scale) - I always redo the math and have found
    many mistakes on their spec sheets.\r\n\r\n Sometimes it's amazing to me that
    anything ever gets done\u2026\r\n\r\npbc"

    Although I'd like to say that there is no correct way and your Kiwi printer is
    an idiot. It's the old data vs information argument, data is meaningless until
    it's given context, at which point it becomes information, it's up to the parties
    involved to decide the context and set the parameters.\r\n\r\nIf you want to blame

    reading the dimensions left to right on a portrait sheet, as in 297 x 210?\r\n\r\nThe
    bit with the paper grain is important though because it affects the feel and behaviour
    of the sheet: paper is stiffer across the grain (letters, business cards) and
    curls along the grain (covers, folders).\r\n\r\nLeigh: I'd wait with idiocy verdicts
