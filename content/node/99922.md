  body: "Viruses are terrible things that can be used for evil!\r\n\r\nThus, responsible
    computer programmers will only reveal knowledge about viruses to chelas that have
    proven their responsibility and good character. In fact, this sort of knowledge,
    to avoid burdening the guru's karma, is normally not transmitted directly, but
    instead results from the student's illumination as he is initiated into the mysteries
    of computer programming for good and useful purposes."

  body: "Attempting to create a virus is lame, and even more so when you have to <em>ask</em>
    how it's done. There is no more such a thing as a \"simple\" virus -- writing
    one (fortunately) requires intimate knowledge of the targeted computer system,
    both hardware and running OS, and including all of its backdoors and vulnerabilities.
    These days, to write a virus you have to be a <em>very</em> competent programmer.\r\n\r\nCompetent
    programmers don't need to \"ask\" stuff like this, and most certainly not on a
    forum dedicated to Typography.\r\n\r\nAlso bear in mind that writing a virus is
    illegal and a punishable crime in most countries, because of the simple to grasp
    fact that, would you succeed in writing and dispersing one, you'd not only be
    'stealing' bandwidth and storage space, but you could also do damage to software
    and hardware, and in the most extreme cases not only cause financial damage, but
    also \"real world\" damage, possibly with a cost of human lives. You might defend
    yourself with, \"yeh but I'm just experimenting\".  Imagine your experiment runs
    amok and ends up in a hospital computer. People could very well die from that.\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't mind if the moderators remove this threat, erm, I meant to say \"thread\"."
