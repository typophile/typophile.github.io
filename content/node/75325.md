  long should it stand as yours, and nobody can use your work without paying for it
  or gaining written consent? How long are economic benefits ethically able to be
  gained from the work?\r\n\r\nThe main question I want to see responses to- We are
  all designers in one way or another, we are those making the content that is needing
  protection- why are we not the ones making the rules around how it can be re-used
  for the greater good- and to this end would a worldwide and uniform system that
  designers can subscribe to and feel protected by be worth looking into?\r\n\r\nIf
  there are any resources or interesting articles and examples you have come across,
  this is the place to put it to add to the discussion.\r\n\r\n>>\r\n\r\nMy view is
  I ought to be able to benefit from the work financially for 10 to 15 years, after
  which point the work is available to all free of charge to be adapted and copied
  for whatever use. I personally don't like the idea of holding back others' creativity
  with my work just because I can. I'll never truly see the fruits of my labours unless
  I allow it to grow."

    is just one of the creative activities that need to be protected among many others
    (painting, writing, sculpting, etc.), and most of them are covered by the law
    in different grades in many countries. If some special \u201Cworldwide and uniform
    system\u201D is required specifically for designers, it should not be something
    you \u201Ccan subscribe\u201D, but something you MUST follow, whether you like
    it or not, so it can be \u201Cworldwide\u201D and \u201Cuniform\u201D. But that
    is pretty close to something called \u201Claw\u201D, and it already exists. Of
    course the law is perfectible and actually it is feasible to change it, but first
    you must convince everybody that your system is better than the existing one,
    and to achieve this is not an easy task: to begin with, IMHO 10 to 15 years is
    a really short time. I feel more protected by the laws in my country (100 years
    after my death) and the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works|Berne
    convention]]."

    and \u201Cuniform\u201D, so type design can be protected in USA, for example."

  body: Interesting... and valid. You must be very guarding of your work if 15 years
    isn't enough, or, conversely, need it to be guarded for this extended period of
    time. Calling it a Law wouldn't be a bad thing, and making say, type designers
    works longer protected would be acceptable to some, but not to others. Why would
    a graphic designer (non type designer) want to have less of a copyright period...
    this is where the ruccus starts up...
