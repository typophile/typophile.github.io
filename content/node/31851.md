body: "For all you type designers - I often shortcut to a font by starting to type
  its name into the \"character\" window and letting the computer fill in the rest,
  rather than scrolling down the list of activated fonts. I'm currently using Klavika
  for a project and the computer jumps to fill in \"Arrows\" rather than Plain or
  Plain OSF or something I might actually be using. I mean... does anyone actually
  use those arrows? But Klavika isn't the only font that does this. Mrs. Eaves jumps
  to Fractions for example. Is there a way, when constructing a font, for you to take
  into account the weight or style that the average user would be most likely to want
  (the plain) and then name the font or its weights in such a way that it becomes
  the default? And then if we want the caps or fractions or the... arrows... we can
  scroll to it manually.\r\n\r\nOr is this a font management software question? I
  should add that the same thing happens in both Quark and InDesign. It's a small
  annoyance of course but the time spent scrolling needlessly through font menus does
  add up."

  body: Yes, I do that. That's not the problem, it's just that I find it quicker to
    start typing in the font name to the Character window and it would be nice if
    the default would come up as Plain rather than the obscure Arrows or Fractions.
    I was wondering if this was something font designers could take into account as
    they name their fonts. It takes more time to scroll thru a list - and since I
    work on several projects at a time the list of active fonts can get long.

    eg \"Z Arrows\". The problem is that whiile application menus sort family members
    according to weight, irrespective of actual font style name, they sort \"non-weight\"
    names literally by alphabetic order.\r\n\r\n"

    area. Sometimes they don't notice the threads here.

  body: "When we create altered fonts for our weekly circular, we give them font names
    with numbers in the front of them so that we can call them up faster. Our naming
    system goes something like this:\r\n\r\n1CircularPricePoint\r\n2CircularLeadin\r\n3CircularCopy\r\n4CircularDisclaimer\r\n\r\nWhen
    we change fonts in Quark, we do the keyboard shortcut to get to the font menu,
    type one number and hit return and we're there: (shift,option,command M + 1 +
    return = 1CircularPricePoint)\r\n\r\nWe're all about speed!\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nWhat really kills me are font foundries that name their font one thing,
    but have it display a different name so that it appears elsewhere in the font
    listing. Wittenberger Fraktur, for example, is just Fraktur when I'm trying to
    go through my font listings, so if it's active and I try to get an Fr face I end
    up in the W part of the list. Grrrr...."

    FontBureau. I want to search for Agency but it's Bureau Agency. Or Berthold Akzidenz
    Grotesk. I can't be bothered to remember the foundry name for every font!\r\n\r\nOr
    they put their name there and then remove them. I still absent-mindedly look for
    FF Meta."

    only good work-around I see is to let users name their fonts themselves a la iTunes
    in their font utility. The other option is to simply make ''working'' groups of
    fonts rather than a giant list. That can save time too. '

  body: No no - silly. Not the font files temselves - just the link to the font files.
    It's non-destructive titling. And renaming the actual font files would break the
    fonts.

    \u2013 now that's what I call an industrial strength technique."
