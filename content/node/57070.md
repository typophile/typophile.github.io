  body: "I could be wrong but have you tried inserting an explicit line \"script latn;\"
    below your line \"# Latin\" in locl?\r\nID does casing first, then applies c2sc
    to the uppercased string. Idotaccent and Idotaccentsmall are not covered in your
    classes @uc and @sc, so are not available to c2sc. Also I think you can omit Ismall
    and Idotaccentsmall from \"sub [i Ismall] by [i.TRK Idotaccentsmall];\" in locl
    but then need an additional line in smcp, as sketched <a href=\"http://www.kltf.de/stuff/locl-feature.zip\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I spotted \"sub f i.TRK by fi;\" in liga which is better removed. Part
    of i.TRK's job is <em>avoiding</em> this ligature if language is TRK. In Turkish,
    i-with-dot and i-without-dit are separate letters, and an f-i ligature in which
    the dot is connected to the f would look like f-dotlessi ...\r\n"

  body: "Claus, \r\n\r\nit's quite simple: your <code>smcp</code> feature is only
    registered in <code>latn dflt</code> (also other features, I guess, such as kern).
    \r\n\r\nIn the lower-right part of the OpenType panel, you need to declare ALL
    languagesystems in which you want to register the feature definitions which do
    not have explicit languagesystem handling. If this is not done, the features get
    registered only in the implied languagesystem, which is <code>latn dflt</code>.
    \r\n\r\nSo, you should put: \r\n\r\n<code>languagesystem DFLT dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem
    latn dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem latn PLK;\r\nlanguagesystem latn MOL;\r\nlanguagesystem
    latn ROM;\r\nlanguagesystem latn TRK;\r\nlanguagesystem latn AZE;\r\nlanguagesystem
    latn CRT;\r\nlanguagesystem cyrl dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem cyrl SRB;\r\nlanguagesystem
    grek dflt;</code>\r\n\r\nI see that you have done this but there may be something
    wrong there... \r\n\r\nAlso, I advise that you don't use glyphnames outside of
    AGLFN. <code>Asmall</code> is a definietely a bad idea. <code>A.smcp</code> or
    <code>A.sc</code> or <code>A.small</code> would be much better. \r\n\r\nUse DTL
    OTMaster or FontTools/TTX to examine your font and find out if the <code>smcp</code>-related
    lookups get actually registered in the <code>latn TRK</code> languagesystem. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"

    in a version 1.1, there was unfortunately a little bug, but Ben got it sorted.
    Then we ran into another issue in the BetterFontGenerate script, which might be
    solved. I just ran it on another Fontlab file tonight and had the issue again.
    I will inform Ben directly if I see it again. The BetterFontGenerate is now hovering
    around version 1.6 I believe, and I hope the issue I ran into today was just a
    temporary Fontlab quip.\r\n\r\nBy the way I got the 'Nsmall' idea from the FreeFont
