body: "Hi, guys and girls!\r\nOkay, so I've come across this typeface in two separate
  (but related) publications and am extremely curious to know its name/s and origin.\r\n\r\nThis
  image is from an Anne Rice short story published in the January 1979 issue of Playboy
  magazine.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Interlude_4798.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
  these images are from the dust jacket of \"The Tale of the Body Thief\", a novel
  by Anne Rice published in 1992.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Anne_5584.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tale_3880.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow,
  I have come across two fonts that are almost identical to this typeface: Octavian
  (by Brendel Informatik, 1994) and Implicit SSi (by Southern Software, 1992).\r\nSo,
  can anybody here PLEASE help me out with more information about this typeface?"

    looks like a perfect match to your samples (better than Octavian and Implicit)
    \r\nbut I don't know if this is really an original design by Brendel Informatik.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason is that Both Brendel Informatik and Southern Software are known for a lot
    of font forgeries, and Esther font is included in a list in the following forgery
    report:\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/greenstreet.pdf\r\n"

  body: "My word! Thanks so, so, SO much! I probably would never have found Esther
    were it not for you! And yes, it's an exact match, as you said. Awesome!\r\nNow
    the question is: Which font did Brendel steal to \"create\" Ether? Ooh, I'm so
    very curious!\r\nThanks again!"

    or its designer on the internet. May I ask where you got your info? I just want
    to have some reference material to go on. Thank you again!

    typeface is so scarce, though.
