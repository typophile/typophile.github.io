body: do you know how to convert an angled shape to a rounded shape without loosing
  its character - in FontLab. for example converting a polygon to a rounded polygon.
  the point is that the resulting shape should be really rounded - and not simply
  having rounded angles.

  body: What did you do so far, convert corner points to curve points? Now you probably
    just need to pull the handles out farther from each node until you achieve the
    desired shape. I'm just starting to learn the ropes of this program (lot of ropes!).
    Seasoned users may have some better techniques. Sounds like what you're after
    is a wonky circle.

  body: "imagine a stretched 8-gon, 12-gon, or 16-gon or any n-gon. now try to round
    that polygon in illustrator to create a perfectly rounded \"O\", similar to a
    condensed font \"O\". the resulting \"O\" won't look like a stretched circle (ellipse),
    it will look like a rectangled circle -  that vintage TV screen shape. I couldn't
    find a way to do this neither in Illustrator nor in FontLab.\r\n\r\nI could pull
    the handles but the resulting rounded shape has to be regular (symetrical). that
    means we need some kind of automated function to create a rounded shape out of
    a an angled one, or at least appropriate grid snapping. \r\n\r\nAfter rounding,
    the corner points should remain at their original coordinates, as well.\r\n"

  body: "If you want the TV shape I would suggest smooth points at the sides and top/bottom,
    and corner points in the corners. If the latter are too sharp, change to smooth
    points with the control points very close to the point.\r\n\r\nI doubt you will
    find a filter for this, but you should be able to do a decent job with a lot of
    guides to align your control points correctly."

    might be scripts for Illustrator that do this. Surf to Adobe Exchange:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=productHome&exc=17&loc=en_us\r\n\r\nEdit:

    then there's this plug-in PointControl, that has a feature \"Make Points Curves
    or Corners - Converts selected points on any number of paths to corner or curve
    points but does not change current handle position.\":\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&loc=en_us&extid=1045874\r\n\r\n\r\n.
