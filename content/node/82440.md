  wtf forums seem that helpful any more. so, i humbly come to the real pro's to bestow
  knowledge upon.\r\n\r\nany idea what this typeface is? the designer who put this
  together about 20 years ago is no longer among us.\r\n\r\nsorry, i am new to this

  body: "The only duplicated letter is the A and those two A's do not seem identical.
    The W is also rather strange. Those two points make me think this is not a font,
    but artwork.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "If you look at the serifs near the baseline, they seem different to me. Also
    the E is another strange letter. I still think the reason you aren't finding it
    is because it's artwork and not a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
