  post</a> by our very own Florian Hardwig (see image below) and I am wondering whether
  there are some others worth mentioning? \r\n\r\nSo far I found Cabarga Cursive and
  Coptek, but surely there must be more out there? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\n<a

    older thread</a> on angular scripts on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/3055396859/in/set-72157608886711507/\">that
    Flickr page</a>?\r\n\r\nYes, that genre definitely could do with some additions.
    Maybe we\u2019ll see <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/38752\">one by Underware</a>
    one day?\r\n\r\nMore angled beauties in this list of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/connected_chrome/\">Connected

  body: "The list from Ryuk was pretty good for angular, but maybe some of the heavy
    German styles should also be considered? They are not all angular, exactly, but
    the feel is similar in my opinion. See Tobias Frere-Jones' version of Imre Reiner's
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/reiner-script/|Reiner Script]] (1951),

    and using my notes about existing fonts of the heavy German styles.\r\n\r\n- Mike
