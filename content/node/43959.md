  to the foundry section of our website. \r\n\r\nCurrently if you want to see our
  fonts in action you would use an swf file to preview them. For an example see: http://www.letterbox.net.au/store/order_fonts_berber.html\r\nThis
  can be a time-consuming and a little clumsy.\r\n\r\nFor the last year or so we have
  been dreaming of having our own type-tester like H&FJ:\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100033
  <em>click test drive tab</em>\r\nor T26:\r\nhttp://www.t26.com/fonts/Forma <em>click
  typesetter tab</em>\r\n\r\nNow keeping in mind that we are a small foundry (and
  hiring a top-notch Ajax programmer isn't within our budget) what are our options?\r\n\r\nWe
  are aware of the LetterSetter\u2122 application from LettError, but it doesn't thrill
  us.\r\n\r\nIs there another option?\r\n\r\nDo you run a foundry? What is your experience?
  \r\n\r\nIs this an opportunity for some brilliant programmer to build an alternative?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Would Silverlight work for you? \r\n\r\nhttp://silverlight.net/\r\n\r\nRight
    now, you can pass embedded fonts and show glyphs in fixed layout that will be
    rendered on client system. In version 2 (now in beta) you will have standard text
    box control allowing basic editing. All this stuff should not require expert Ajax
    programming.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"

    That kind of Flash work is a little beyond us.\r\n\r\nSilverlight is a great new
    development, but learning a new programming language and software is not a reality
    for us (still, an intriguing way to spend those quite studio days).\r\n\r\nI guess
    what we were looking for was an option along the lines of LetterSetter but a bit
    more enticing to use. T26 make good use of this type of system.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    just putting it our there ..."
