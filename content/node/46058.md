  body: "Hi Dave,\r\n\r\n\u2018Link\u2019 is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/carolina/familytree.html\">Carolina</a>.\r\nNot
    sure about the upright typeface for \u2018Youth\u2019. The exit stroke of the
    \u2018u\u2019 and the top part of the \u2018t\u2019 are pretty distinctive, though.
    Similar to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-californian/familytree.html\">Californian</a>.\r\nF"
