  body: It's a user-modified version of the old typeface, Templar. The only digital
    version readily available is <a href='http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/iskola/'
    target='_blank'>Iskola</a>. Scroll down in the glyph palette to see your unmodified,
    alternate R.

  body: "Also independently digitized by Dan X. Solo. Software 1998 and included on
    a Dover Publications CD. The T26 Iskola is better executed. The Solo version uses
    the R in \"APRIL\" in the regular R position. Same for A.\r\nDon\r\n"
