  body: Lars have you investigated cap DOB and der online isn&#39;t as important as
    Berater is it. Try making Berater larger and stronger and make der online smaller,
    just a couple of quick thoughts

  body: Lars, <BR> <BR>Maybe you should forget about no.1 This :// has really been
    done for too many times. No.2 might not be &#34;breathing&#34; enough. Beside
    that it could become quite unlegible in B&amp;W. I would recommend no. 3&#39;s
    further development anyway &#40;altrough its a client&#39;s idea&#41;, but probably
    you should choose a font &#40;or develop the d,o,b letters yourself&#41; which
    actually is symmetric, so that b is a mirrored d. Including all the necessary
    optical corrections of course.  <BR> <BR>Daniel&#39;s opinion about dividing the
    importance of the words is also interesting, but I think that Online and Berater
    share the same level &#40;there is many of other consultants and many of other
    on-line services&#41;. I think the only word which could be at lower importance
    level is the &#34;der&#34; article.

    tech savy people or just your average joe?  Are you trying to appeal more to a
    certain gender, age group, etc?

    may help with the legibility of the &#34;B&#34;.  I also added blue because of
    its technological assocations. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21973.jpg"

  body: I still think that the D letter has lower importance level than O and B. It
    stands just for an article, while O and B stand for a &#34;real&#34; words. According
    to that, I am not sure that DO could work in a conceptual sense.

  body: Oh, yes, I am sorry. I have noticed right now that this vertical ligature
    should form a B letter. As you can see it is not as obvious as someone could think.
    The possible solution could be cutting the D&#39;s steam, so that just a curve
    remains... Or maybe showing only half of O. In that case B could be much more
    readable. <BR> <BR>

  body: Oh, OK, if its still not too late... <BR>I had some ideas when I first saw
    your original post, but didn&#39;t have time to do anything about it. <BR>If you&#39;re
    still open to suggestions, and going back a bit to your original post, maybe try
    a face where the d and b are reflections... <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22107.jpg"
    alt="dob"> <BR> <BR>To be honest, I think the vertical-ligature-b is going in
    a better direction, but it may be a little too much for your client, so I thought
    I&#39;d add my thoughts, just in case you need some more ideas to play around
    with
