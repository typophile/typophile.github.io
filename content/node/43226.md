  for serif fonts to pair with Ministry Script on a wedding invitation. The wedding
  won't be overly formal but I am looking for something that is classy and elegant
  to contrast Ministry Script. I've been testing Warnock Pro and Minion. Preferably
  something with an expert character set (small caps, etc.).\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Thanks
  for any help that you provide."

  body: "> classy and elegant to <em>contrast</em> Ministry Script\r\n\r\n(Emphasis
    mine.) I'm not sure what this means. Are you saying that Ministry does not meet
    your definition of classy and elegant? I just want to clarify your definition
    so I can give appropriate recommendations.\r\n\r\nIdeas:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fountain/eason/\">Eason</a>\r\n<a

  body: Thanks, Stephen. To clarify, what I meant was that I am looking for a serif
    to contrast the calligraphic ministry script. Just looking for something that
    works well with it. Thanks so much for your assistance.
