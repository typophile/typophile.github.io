  body: It&#39;s not that easy - It&#39;s always quoted on several variables like
    how complete is the font, does the client retain exclusivity to the face? For
    how long? Can you resell it? <BR> <BR>Start at $2,500 and add accordingly unless
    they want to buy it outright which you should charge at least 2 to 3 times the
    price since you won&#39;t be receiving any future income from the typeface. <BR>

  body: 'I never quote on a custom job without first asking the client a lot of questions,
    including: <BR> <BR>1. What format will the font be? If TrueType, what level of
    hinting is desired for screen readability? <BR> <BR>2. How large will the character/glyph
    set be?&#42; [Clients sometimes can&#39;t answer this question, so I ask what
    languages they need to support; then I provide a suggested character/glyph set
    based on their needs.] <BR> <BR>3. Does the client want to retain exclusive use
    of the font? For how long? If you will eventually be able to license the font
    to others, what restrictions might apply &#40;e.g. I have made fonts for software
    companies who were content to let me sell the fonts to anyone except companies
    making similar products to their own&#41;. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42; I almost always
    base a quote on a glyph count. I make a spreadsheet in which I list all the glyphs
    that will be included in the font, and then I note how many are base glyphs and
    how many are composites. This provides me with an accurate count on which to quote
    per glyph design and hinting costs. Things like kerning and OpenType feature development
    can&#39;t be dealt with in the same way, of course, and need to be added on top
    of the per glyph costs, but this approach will give you a solid justification
    for your quote, and will also reduce the likelihood that you will underquote.'

  body: Did you ever make a font before? <BR> <BR>If not, $.50 a glyph. <BR> <BR>If
    you did, and you&#39;re actually pretty good, then maybe $100/glyph. <BR> <BR>But,
    the reality is, it&#39;s very variable - for a start, are you really designing,
    or are you adapting something else? Are the character forms complex or simple.
    Can the work be automated in any way... and that&#39;s just digitizing the outlines.
    <BR> <BR>Do they need hinting - if you haven&#39;t done that before then don&#39;t
    start now.

  body: 'Price per glyph is good idea, but only in context of large sets, such ones
    John Hudson do generally. For me, generally I stick with  the usual 256, in several
    weights. <BR> <BR>What is important to me is: <BR>Does the still will be more
    like a complicate stuff, such Copperplate &#40;extrem&#41; or basis Sanserif.
    <BR> <BR>A basic sans is more easy to design generally, compared to the copperplate
    where each cap is quite different, same if you have connections in case of handwriting
    emulation. <BR> <BR>I hope you see my point. <BR> <BR>I generally charge 10/20%
    for a preview of the font, the first Creative step, with several proposals generally.
    Then, if the client accept the concept, we go to more big budget in more secure
    way and trust.'

  body: good idea, i like that. i have produced about 10 fonts and been using fontographer
    about 4 years, i have produced two custom fonts for Levi&#39;s &#40;jeans&#41;
    before but that was whilst i worked for an agency...

  body: Essentially, though JFP says differently, I&#39;d just treat it like piece
    work - ie cost per glyph. If you reduce it to that level, whether you&#39;re doing
    ten characters or 1,000, you know where you&#39;re at. <BR> <BR>What you have
    to think about is what everyone has said above - what are the tasks you need to
    complete, how complex are the characters... <BR> <BR>Once you have some answers,
    then you can think about how long each character will take, and how much you want
    to be paid per hour. If you say you have 100 characters to do, and they average
    an hour each, then multiply your hourly rate up 100 times. <BR> <BR>So, you&#39;re
    up to $50 now. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>You may think that for two weeks work you&#39;ll
    settle for $35, or you may think you really need $75 - tha&#39;s your choice.
    <BR> <BR>What you also have to bear in mind is how much running around you may
    have to do, besides just drawing the characters. This could add 50% to the job.
    <BR> <BR>The figures above are just things to think about - designing, drawing,
    spacing and kerning could take a day per character or more. Just scale it to where
    you think it fits your skills and the job at hand.

  body: Hey, way cool, agreement! I didn&#39;t mean to imply you were wrong in saying
    per glyph only works with large sets. I suppose it&#39;s more that if you sit
    down and quantify properly what you&#39;re going to do, then it&#39;s much easier
    to extrapolate the price. <BR> <BR>A good starting point, IMO, is the number of
    characters you need to do. Then other items become quite apparent. <BR> <BR>Even
    if you buy oranges by the kilo you&#39;re more interested in how many you get
    than anything else - so a couple of big oranges costs the same as several small
    ones... <BR> <BR>Er. :-&#41;

  body: Hrant&#39;s of course right on this. <BR> <BR>Way overquote for the Armenian
    Yellow Pages, because you really don&#39;t want the job in the first place. If
    you&#39;re unfortunate enough to &#34;win&#34; the job you&#39;ll now appreciate
    the extra padding you gave yourself because they&#39;&#39;ll now do their best
    to beat you down on the price you quoted and which they agreed. <BR> <BR>So you
    haggle a little. <BR> <BR>Then do the job, but be prepared for them changing their
    minds mid-stream, but blaming you for putting lies into their mouths - again your
    overquoting will help you stand the aggravation factor. <BR> <BR>When you&#39;ve
    finished the job be prepared for them coming back &#42;forever&#42; asking for
    &#34;little&#34; changes, and not wanting to pay! <BR> <BR>When you eventually
    say &#34;no more&#34; they&#39;ll brand you a cog in the imperialist war machine
    destroying the world and its free-minded peoples. <BR> <BR>They just might be
    right, but either way they&#39;ll always get the last word!
