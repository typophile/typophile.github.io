body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nMy boss ask me if I can present a font chart where i place
  every fonts in many different sizes, bold, italic, all caps and also try them with
  paragraphs with different spaces and tracking to check the best one. I made a brief
  sample in InDesign like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=1udvYBNMWf7W6Gdi6twWRVnriFFsX0\r\n\r\n\r\nWe
  do have quite many of them, so to avoid a quite boring job, i would like to know
  if after i made the chart in an InDesign A4 file, let\xB4s say i chose Garamond
  for the first chart and apply the same characteristic to Helvetica in the next page
  and so for.\r\n\r\nIs there any way that i select all the different font boxes an
  apply a different font name to the whole page without going text by text and paragraph
  by paragraph? Maybe there is some script or way of doing this very mechanical and
  boring task.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for any idea.\r\nBest regards,\r\nSebastiao\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: you can write a script, that goes through all your fonts, and applies each
    one to all text on one page.
