  body: Here&#39;s another one that&#39;s in the Expresiv Ornate collection. There
    it&#39;s called &#34;Energetic&#34;, and Opti also has it, called &#34;Enraged
    Bold&#34;. <BR> <BR>I have never been able to identify the source typeface for
    them.

    rankings in Jared&#39;s Type ID Leader Board.  <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/proud.gif"

  body: Oh, I just thought that was for the Pop ID Quiz solutions. My odds are dropping
    fast then, because I haven&#39;t been getting e-mail notifications lately, &#40;if
    you are &#39;inactive&#39; for a couple of days, do the e-mails stop?&#41; and
    I usually try to answer when I see one that no one else has already gotten it.
    Most of the time, when I see them there have already been three of four posts.  <BR>
    <BR>Anyway, thanks for the &#39;help&#39; ;-&#41;

  body: Hey, that&#39;s cool Yves. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be willing to bet that the TC
    stands for Tom Carnase - a principal in WTC, which originally released two of
    my earlier ID requests that Brendel cloned. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR><br> <BR><br>
