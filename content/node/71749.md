body: "I'm typesetting a schedule of events for a client. \r\n\r\nThe schedule table
  is made up of three columns of information: the time range, the event name, and
  the location. My question is about how best to set the ranges of time in the first
  column. \r\n\r\nShould the numerals in the ranges of time align vertically? Or is
  vertical alignment not a desirable goal because the information isn't meant to be
  compared or contrasted? \r\n\r\nI've attached two samples. In the first, I've aligned
  the numerals vertically because I think it makes it a bit more readable. In the
  second, however, it's more challenging to achieve a vertical alignment. I think
  the only way to do so would be to add more white space following the en dashes in
  all of the time ranges except for the one with \"11:00 am.\" And I think that added
  white space looks bad.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or suggestions? Would you not worry about
  vertical alignment with this type of information?"

    in the first column, 2) a tab for the dash, and 3) another \"align on\" tab to
    align the colons in the second column. \r\n\r\n> And I think that added white
    space looks bad\r\n\r\nTighten the kerning between the first two digits of \"11:00\".
    That will make the 2-digit hour closer in width to the one-digit hours."
