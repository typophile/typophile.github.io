  body: "First, a plea to keep <a href=\"http://typographica.org/001157.php\">publishers
    and retailers</a> separate in this discussion. [[Emigre]] is a publisher, [[MyFonts]]
    is a retailer. [[FontFont]] is a publisher, [[FontShop]] is a retailer. \r\n\r\nIf
    Hrant's question is about publishers (AKA foundries) then there are very few that
    <em>don't</em> require exclusivity. There are always exceptions like ITC Franklin
    (an agreement between two publishers) and Eidetic Neo (a revision of an existing
    typeface submitted to another foundry).\r\n\r\nIf Hrant's question is about retailers
    (AKA resellers), there are very few that <em>do</em> require exclusivity. Of course,
    some, like [[FontShop]] and [[Veer]] do offer extra promotion or a special contract
    in exchange for exclusivity.\r\n\r\nHybrid libraries include [[T-26]] and [[Umbrella]]
    (a [[Veer]] label) which include original fonts but also those that are published
    by other foundries."

    Shinn and Mark Simonson who also sell them direct from their own site and through
    MyFonts.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    are available elsewhere, but we do have a few exclusive arrangements with foundries
    like OurType, Psy/Ops, ARS Type, Type-\xD8-Tones, Dalton Maag, Gestalten, Fontsmith,
    and B&P, with more on the way."
