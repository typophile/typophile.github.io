  body: yeah, the word "motor" suddenly looks nice to me... any idea what substitute
    font i could use (i mean i do start draw myself right now, but unfortunately the
    result won't be gorgeous)? Chriggy

  body: Phew, I'd have to check. There are quite a few Art Deco inspired digital fonts
    available, but I don't know off the top of my head of any that are this wide and
    blocky. :^/

  body: I think the R is out of proportion and the G is too heavy. But it is fun.

  body: hey Miss Tiffany, what other fonts similar to Anisette can you suggest? i'm
    still looking for such a font to buy, Anisette IS great, but maybe there's one
    that i'd like even more?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Anisette_exemple_5459.gif]
