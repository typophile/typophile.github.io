  body: Looks a lot like Stone or Stone Print to me, particularly the <b>s</b>. Maybe
    some of the characters were modified.

  body: 'Trying to do a quick re-create of a logo because the vectors are very slow
    in coming from the client. You&#39;re right Mark, the <b>s</b> is very Stone.
    It&#39;s doubtfull that this is custom. More likely a font distributed with Corel
    Draw or something. '

    less than 15minutes. I didn&#39;t bother to fix the cheltenham serifs since this
    is going to be used small. Thanks! '
