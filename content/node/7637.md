body: Hello everyone, I&#39;m new to this site and I am excited to have input with
  this bunch of great creative minds. Here are some of my logos that I have come up.
  Some of these are old. Let me know what you think. Thanks again. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53333.jpg"

  body: it&#39;s difficult to give constructive feedback without  having any background
    information. <BR>  <BR>First of all, it would be helpful to tell us what each
    logo is for. <BR> <BR> <BR>Greetings!

    look.

  body: 'Chris I think that you should concetrate on the font choice. On each logo
    you posted it seems as though you used typefaces haphazardly. <BR>  On the garage
    logo it seems like you used &#34;ITC Anna Std&#34; by Daniel Pelavin, which in
    fact was designed for his wedding invitation and also was used on the birth announcement
    of his first child, Anna. It has no usage on garage stuff. <BR>The proper usage
    for this font would be any special occasion. &#40;The font is Daniel&#39;s view
    of art deco&#41;. <BR>  The second logo seems to be completely frivolous. No connection
    between your elements. I am not going to comment on the color choice. Could you
    think of better colors that contribute to the words &#34;design&#34;&#40;since
    it is a web application design&#41; and &#34;pulse&#34;. <BR>Q : Is green your
    favorite color? <BR>  The third logo seems to be based on the font Haettenschweiler,
    which is frequently used by inexperienced designers. You should use this font
    very carefully. I felt confused by your 3rd logo. The reasons for the this was
    firstly for the tagline and secondly for the curverd arrow&#40;which symbolizes
    what?&#41;. <BR> <BR>I hope this will be helpful.  <BR>In general, I suggest you
    do some conceptualization before doing anything on the screen and avoid the pitfalls
    of erroneous font choice.'

  body: Let me begin by saying that I am not an expert myself and I&#39;m learning
    myself as we speak. The only way of becoming better is by knowing - and avoiding
    - our mistakes in the future. <BR> <BR>Galin had some good points with regards
    to the font choice. Despite that, I do think that the first logo gives you that
    retro look that you wanted to create. <BR> <BR>The second logo certainly doesn&#39;t
    invoke the idea of a web application company. I would have guessed something in
    the medical field. It probably doesn&#39;t help that you have picked those colours
    either. I don&#39;t know where you live, but in my country all surgeons have this
    green-ish colour for their outfits ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Compared to the font, your
    pulse line looks too edgy. It doesn&#39;t harmonise very well with the round edges.
    It also needs more vertical and horizontal space to the wordmark - especially
    if printed smaller. &#40;But that&#39;s only assuming that you have to have a
    pulse line there at all in the first place!&#41; Galin mentioned it; take a piece
    of paper and conceptualise some ideas before touching your computer. <BR> <BR>The
    third logo - afraid to say this - is my least favourite. It is way too cluttered
    and needs a lot of simplification. That square behind the CAT must go. why the
    empasis on &#34;CAT&#34; and not on the M &#40;for Malicious&#41; as well? Why
    the arrow? It doesn&#39;t seem to contribute anything to the idea. Are you trying
    to send a secret visual message that I&#39;m too ignorant to understand? :-&#41;
    <BR> <BR>I understand your choice of &#34;Impact&#34; - you wanted to make a bold
    and dominant statement which probably fits to a security company quite well. So,
    well done on the thinking!  <BR> <BR>It just needs a little more refinement and
    work &#40;see above...&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Well done on your designs - keep &#39;em
    coming!

  body: Thanks, for the responses Samann and  Galin. Yes, I will in the future be
    more careful with font selection. Like I said some of these are old specifically
    pulse and mcat. The car graphic is one thing that I did on paper first. However
    the other font selections I had for it originally, the customer did not like.
    I&#39;m guessing he likes art deco? In any-case I appreciate your input.  <BR>
    <BR>The mcat design was based on how code can get manipulated and inserted into
    applications that it was not designed for causing compromise of a system. I&#39;m
    sure though I could have come up with something better to convey that. <BR> <BR>Just
    out of curiosity, do you use any stock fonts or do you create them all yourself,
    or just modify existing fonts enough that they are not recognizable and fit your
    design?

  body: Joes Garage. Humm. Where to start critique. Well the type style &#43; the
    words &#34;Joe&#39;s&#34; automatically makes me think of a Diner, and the car
    looks more like fish bones than a car. Automotive repair is to hard to read on
    a fast take. Make it a simple sans, this also brings hierchy to the information
    you are trying to convey. <BR> <BR>Pulse Micro. Why is it green?, Not exactly
    the first colors that come to mind for web/coding. Spacing between letters needs
    work- think of spacing as volume not distance. Rounded forms with a jagged &#34;pulse
    line&#34; a harsh mix.  <BR>mcat- no comment. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53939.jpg"
