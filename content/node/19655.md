body: This is my first attempt at designing a typeface. This is for an assignment
  in type class and I drew my inspiration from an R I saw on a headstone in a cemetary.
  The name comes from the fact that some of the letterforms are a combination of regular
  and small caps. I'm still working on a few of the letters...the Q, S, G, and O in
  particular...so any feedback is welcome. Thanks!

  body: "As with the other cemetary font (your classmate?) this begs a lowercase.
    Not that you need that for your grade, but would make it much more useful. If
    there isn't time, I'd be even finishing off a few lowercase letters to show the
    feel would probably get you a better grade for extra effort (unless it doesn't
    work that way anymore)\r\n: )"
