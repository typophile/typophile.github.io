  body: "This was a tricky one, but I\u2019ll have to go with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/graphicus-dt/|Graphicus
    DT Bold]]. The light condensed subhead type below matches the same family and
    confirms the match."

  body: Actually, the angles on the terminals of the C's and the slightly different
    weight of them, tells me the C's are Avenir with the rest in Futura Bold.
