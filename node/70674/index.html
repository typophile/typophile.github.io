The very same thought occurred to me!
You&rsquo;re in Italy—have you encountered this kind of use of &ldquo;etruschi&rdquo; before?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid, I haven&rsquo;t. But keep in mind that I&rsquo;m a product of the desktop publishing revolution, which, in Italy, wiped out almost all the traditional specialised nomenclature trough bad or inexistent translations.
Maybe Antonio Cavedoni (<a href="http://typophile.com/user/8976)">http://typophile.com/user/8976)</a>, which I gather have a vastly greater historical knowledge than mine, could give you some further insight.</p>
<p>By the way, it would be interesting to know if the term was used in later Nebiolo specimens.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here is a couple of references I have found in my library about the Italian “Etrusca” typefaces. They show how the same name was given, in different times, to very different typefaces.</p>
<p>The first is taken from “Questioni di carattere”, a 1997 book a book Italian 20th century Italian typography, written by Manuela Rattin and Matteo Ricci. An “Etrusca” typeface was quoted, among others, by designer Carlo Frassinelli in 1921, as a “new” typographic way, linked to the the Liberty style; in Frassinelli’s view, the Etrusca, crafted by Augusta foundry in 1910s, is a loose, dynamic typeface, able to set a certain “movement” to the printed page (a feature most seeked by the Futurism typography). Here is the typeface from the 1910 Augusta foundry catalogue – the Art Nouveau influence is noticeable:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/augusta02_6329.jpg]</p>
<p>The other reference is from a 1969 printed specimen, by Fonderia Tipografica Cooperativa, which was founded in Milan in 1886. The specimen was designed by Umberto Fenocchio, who worked at Nebiolo with Aldo Novarese, and features severals typefaces, some of them designed by Fenocchio himself (like “Linea”), others most likely from the Monotype or Nebiolo catalogues. The specimen features two similar sans serif typeface families named “Etruria” and “Etrusco”, grounded in the Grotesk tradition. Etruria came in light, book, demi, bold, black, light italic, bold italic (approximate transalation of Italian terms); “Etrusco” was a different, condensed sans (for titling?), in light, book, bold, bold extracondensed, extrablack.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<p>ETRURIA:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, thanks, Nicola, for adding this information.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in puzzling out the first example, particularly. This &ldquo;Augusta&rdquo; foundry, I have gathered, was the name for a while given to merged Italian foundries including Nebiolo. In fact, the name also appeared on the cover of the specimen book that I cited in my blog entry. I don&rsquo;t think there was a date on that book - I took the &ldquo;ca. 1910&rdquo; from the Harvard catalogue information. So in other words your example and mine issued from the same people right around the same time (though I don&rsquo;t think the specimen books are the same).</p>
<p>Have you seen the entire page from which that first image was taken, or was the excerpting done by Rattin &amp; Ricci source? I ask because by &ldquo;Etrusca&rdquo;&rsquo;s placement as a header and next to the word &ldquo;Serie,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m led to wonder if the label was also intended to refer to other, different fonts on the page.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting font - I can see it used as signage for a tiki bar!</p>

<p>You are right, Craig. Rattin and Ricci&rsquo;s book give the same information: Augusta was established in 1908 by Nebiolo and Urania foundries and soon came to gather fourteen different foundries: Nebiolo, Urania, Paolo Albé and son, Filippo Fiazza, Carlo Radaelli, Francesco Rizzi, F. Zappa, Wilmant L., Baccigaluppi &amp; C., Ferdinando Negroni, Rayper &amp; C, Fratelli Alessandri, Cucco &amp; Gorigli and Dell&rsquo;Orto. It seems that common specimens were also printed. The image I posted was published in Rattin and Ricci&rsquo;s book. It was originally printed, I believe, in the already mentioned 1910 Augusta specimen, then re-printed by Frassinelli in his 1921 piece on &ldquo;Il Risorgimento Grafico&rdquo;, titled &ldquo;Rivoluzione Grafica (I)&rdquo;. The other featured typefaces - all in the same Art Nouveau/Liberty vein - are Lisbona, Minerva and Electa. I&rsquo;ll post the complete image as soon as I can.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello,
since I&rsquo;m more on the Nebiolo-side than Antonio (with whom we are doing this research in spare time) I can say the term “etruschi” used to be quite common in Italy to indicate generically all kinds of industrial-age sans-serif alphabets.</p>
<p>Most of the samples you provided are from the ubiquitous German typeface which is mostly known as &ldquo;Aurora&rdquo; (from the C.E. Weber foundry) in its original incarnation. I have still to track down which was the first version. In Italy, we have had our &ldquo;customized&rdquo; version, Cairoli, which was also copied and copied (&ldquo;Etruria&rdquo; here is an example of these &ldquo;copies of a copy&rdquo;).</p>
