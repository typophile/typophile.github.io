    invitation?\r\n\r\nSee [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/eddy/|eddy]]
    for a similar font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The \"blots\" are an affectation that are used quite a bit in this style
    Mike. As are intermittent thicks. As to whether this is a font... anybody's guess,
    too hard to tell. And no, it is not a \"grunge\" invention, it's older than you
    or I.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: I actually don't see a single "blot" in this face, just that all of the counters
    are filled in. Has no "grunge" about it, to these eyes. My feeling is that this
    <em>is</em> a font based on the uppercase Ls, the uppercase Ns and numeral 2s.

  body: My google-fu is failing me right now, but I researched this a couple of months
    ago and came across an interview with the owner of [[http://mrboddington.com/|the
    studio]] that created these invitations. She said that they had 15(?) custom fonts,
    so I'm guessing that this is one of those exclusive faces.
