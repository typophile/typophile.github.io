    difficulty is that \"design\" is an extremely broad term.\r\nType design is not
    like music, where composition, arrangement, and performance are quite distinct--although
    even in music digital culture has produced difficulties concerning the legitimacy
    of sampling."

  body: "Ten years ago, Sean Cavanaugh supplied the following legal explanations in
    a bulletin board as a reply to a question by a certain person called Phan:\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nFrom:
    Sean Cavanaugh\r\nDate: Mon, 27 Jul 1998\r\n\r\nPhan, I appreciate your comments,
    but labeling me a pirate or a thief is\r\nunjustified (not to mention totally
    lame). Let me explain.\r\n\r\n  A couple of years ago I used to work for a company
    called SoftMaker,\r\nInc., which was later acquired by Kingsley/ATF and merged
    into a company\r\ncalled SoftMaker/ATF. Prior to the merger, SoftMaker, Inc. developed
    and\r\nsold a Type 1 font scaler for DOS applications (DOS!) such as Word and\r\nWordPerfect.
    SoftMaker also licensed and sold a large number of URW\r\ntypefaces. SoftMaker,
    Inc.'s parent company, SoftMaker GmbH of Nurnberg,\r\nhad (and has, I believe)
    a close working relationship with URW's founder\r\nPeter Karow.\r\n\r\n  Maybe
    some people will look down their noses at URW, but URW's\r\ncontribution to digital
    typography is undeniable. URW performed the\r\noriginal digitization of many of
    today's popular fonts for a number of\r\nleading foundries. The digitization wasn't
    cheap. When a foundry approached\r\nURW to do the work, URW would say, \"OK, we'll
    do the whole font for $X,\"\r\n(sound of foundry representative gasping), \"Or,
    we'll do it for $X minus $Y\r\nif we can retain the right to resell and re-license
    the outlines.\"\r\n\r\n  Well, in a great many cases, the foundries opted for
    Door #2. In other\r\nwords, they entered into agreements with URW. This isn't
    theft or piracy.\r\nIf you accuse URW of anything, accuse them of being shrewd.
    Or maybe accuse the original foundries of under-valuing their assets.\r\n\r\n
    \ Back to SoftMaker. At the time of the \"merger\" with Kingsley/ATF, it\r\nbecame
    apparent that Kingsley/ATF only wanted SoftMaker so they could get\r\nback into
    the type business (ATF was defunct at the time) and basically\r\ncollect on overdue
    trademark license fees from companies that had been\r\nusing ATF trademarks for
    free.\r\n\r\n  None of that money went into the company, but rather into the pockets
    of\r\na handful of lawyers and businessmen. At that point I had been working\r\nwithout
    pay for a couple of months, under the idea that the merger would\r\nturn things
    around, and we'd all be one happy type company. (sound of\r\nlaughing lawyers)\r\n\r\n
    \ I left the company disgusted, to say the least. I was then approached by\r\nan
    agent to write a book about typography and design. I thought it was a\r\ngreat
    idea, and being unemployed, I'd have plenty of time to spend writing.\r\nAnd then
    a light bulb went off in my head: Instead of taking SoftMaker/ATF\r\nto court
    for the thousands of dollars they owed me, I requested the company\r\ngrant me
    a license to distribute a number of the URW and ATF fonts from\r\ntheir collection.
    I had no intention of starting a type company (and still\r\ndon't) -- I just wanted
    to include a companion CD of typefaces with the book.\r\n\r\n  And that's how
    Digital Type Design Guide was born, along with its\r\ncompanion CD, and the follow-up
    CD to that, The FontSite 500 CD (which\r\ncontains the 220 fonts from the first
    CD, plus an additional 280 fonts).\r\n\r\n  It's a decent type collection. I've
    worked on many of the included URW\r\noutlines, making improvements to hints,
    bitmaps, and in some cases metrics\r\nand kern pairs -- that was my job, after
    all, at SoftMaker. I guess you\r\ncould say I'm proud of it, but still, if you
    look on page 166 of my book,\r\nyou'll find the following:\r\n\r\n  \"My hope
    is that if you become sufficiently excited about the world of\r\ntype, you will
    migrate to some of the higher-end vendors such as Adobe,\r\nMonotype, and Agfa.\"\r\n\r\n
    \ See, the thing is, I'M NOT IN THE F*CKING TYPE BUSINESS, and I have no\r\nplans
    of ever getting back into it. I absolutely despise the business end\r\nof type
    -- both the practices of the foundry barons of yore and the lawyers\r\nof today.
    I don't sell anything in stores or mail order or in any other\r\nchannels. I have
    my own website, and I will continue to promote my book and\r\nthe small collection
    of fonts I acquired from SoftMaker/ATF. I've almost\r\nsold enough to pay for
    the site's expenses. After taxes, I'll be a f*cking\r\nHUNDREDAIRE! Yippee!\r\n\r\n>
    and Zapf (who goes into convulsions whenever he sees pirated designs)\r\n\r\n
    \ You'll notice on my CD is a face named URW Palladio, which is a\r\nknock-off,
    of sorts, of Palatino. But do you know who designed URW\r\nPalladio? The same
    guy who designed Palatino -- Hermann Zapf! (You'll also\r\nfind Zapf's URW Antiqua
    and URW Latino on the CD) So you can spare me the\r\nsermon on Zapf, who also
    happens to be a friend of Peter Karow.\r\n\r\n  To wrap this up (and sorry for
    the length, but you did ask for a\r\n\"justification\"), I'm not in the same boat
    with snakes like Paul King of\r\nSSI and their ilk, and I resent any implication
    otherwise. If you and Roy\r\nwant to take some bullshit high and mighty approach
    with me, I suggest you\r\ndo a little research first to find out what the hell
    you're talking about.\r\n\r\n  But thanks for asking, anyway. And I really do
    appreciate your concerns.\r\nWe're on the same side of the copyright issue. You
    have to keep in mind\r\nthat holding a copyright does not preclude one from entering
    into licensing\r\nand distribution arrangements as many companies did with URW.\r\n\r\n-
    Sean\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nIn my document about the FontSite outfit, I do not blame
    Sean Cavanaugh for distributing fonts. I only blame him for falsely claiming to
    be the \"copyright owner\" and the \"trademark owner\", which he is definitely
    not.\r\n\r\nIf he removed the copyright notices and the trademark notices from
    the fonts and discarded the EULA, nobody could blame him for cheating.\r\n"
