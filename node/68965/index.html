		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, guys-</p>
<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve developed a routine that helps me to design a basic characters set wit some speed, which allows me then to go back, and review the result without any real loss of production time.</p>
<p>Some five years ago I started wondering if this method was the best one, and experienced with other ways of font design, like hand drawing and scanning; drawing in Illustrator, and copying and pasting into FontLab; and mixing the order of designing glyphs. In the end I kept to my old method.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also made a conscious effort to use more time to make a font, and after three or four weeks of tinkering I compared the first version to the version I used more time on, and saw no real improvement, so once again I kept to my old method.</p>
<p>For me one week is about average from idea to a finished font. After that it slows down; italics and different weights take a lot more time, and finishing a complete font family takes months easily.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick; you gave me a courtesy by giving me your critique by e-mail, rather than here on the forum, and that was very decent thing to do. I hope you don&rsquo;t mind my quoting you here.</p>
<p>From your point of view Tournedot &ldquo;looks like hand writing, but the repeated details are too consistent for that. Therefore the effect is false. Contextualization in OpenType is a new idea that addresses this issue. So far it has been used almost exclusively for script faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some mulling over, I have to disagree. After waiting some twenty years since PostScript, we actually have a chance to use ligatures and alternate characters, and you want to discourage designers to impliment that possibility. Tournedot is a font, not lettering. It is not following traditional type design dogma, but rather looking for the boundaries of it (sorry; that sounded suprisingly pompous).</p>
<p>I understand that this new technology can cause the same confusion that happened with lithography in 1900&rsquo;th century, when suddenly any form was possible for printing. We saw the same thing with PostScript in the 90&rsquo;s, and with OT, we&rsquo;ll see more.</p>
<p>Each new technology needs to find its limits, before it can find its best qualities. This applies to OpenType as well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>&hellip;we actually have a chance to use ligatures and alternate characters, and you want to discourage designers to impliment that possibility&hellip;</em></p>
<p>No I don&rsquo;t. Ligatures and alternates ARE contextual. For instance, one would not set &ldquo;d with flourish&rdquo; when followed by &ldquo;l&rdquo;.
So I approve of your alternates and ligatures!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I still think you could use alternate glyphs to give an impression of the subtle variations in serif form that occur with hand lettering, rather than just for alternate letter-shapes.</p>
<p>Actually, you needn&rsquo;t even do that: just don&rsquo;t rely so much on cutting-and pasting, but take a little more time to hand-craft each glyph individually. The overall effect will look more human, less plastic.</p>
<p><em>Tournedot is a font, not lettering. </em></p>
<p>Then why does it look like brush lettering? The swelling of the vertical stems towards the baseline, the &ldquo;brushy&rdquo; serifs that begin and end strokes, the non-geometric, organic curves, the softened corners, the casual jauntiness of &ldquo;g&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo;, the large counter in &ldquo;e&rdquo;&ndash;typical of mid-20th century brush lettering, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
<p><em>It is not following traditional type design dogma,</em></p>
<p>Yes it is.
It has the traditional regimentation that has generally occurred when a hand-lettering style is turned into a font.
For instance, all the letters stand precisely on the baseline in a way that hand lettering never could achieve.</p>
<p>If you are going to design a typeface which is so strongly informed by hand-lettering, why not use available technology to do a better simulation than was possible in the past?</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to make it more &ldquo;font-like&rdquo;, impose a greater degree of regularity and stylization; refine it more. For instance, make the &ldquo;entry&rdquo; serif on &ldquo;i&rdquo; and &ldquo;n&rdquo; the same.</p>
<p>At the moment, the idea is not fully realized: it is caught between being a simulation of hand lettering and being a fully refined and rigorously stylized typeface.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to upset you like this, but I stand behind my design; Tournedot is a font for headline use with two different stylistic sets.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tomi,</p>
<p>The design is nice, but i also agree with Nick. The font is really caught between types. I see it as a heavily formalized script font. But, even that description does not seem right either, since it doesn&rsquo;t flow like a script font should.</p>
<p>I would call it, as riccardO suggested, a ballpoint font, more than anything else.</p>
<p>The forms do look nice, and the alternatives are a neat thought.</p>
<p>I do understand what Nick is saying though. You&rsquo;ve headed in two, possibly three, directions. I think you need to choose just one direction.</p>

<p>I do understand yours (and Nick&rsquo;s) point of view. And I can symphatise with it. To me it was just another design needing to get out of my head. In fact it was pencil, not a ball point pen that brought this one about.</p>
<p>I know it is not within any conventional type styles, and that was the reason I decided to make it. OT features are just extra.</p>
<p>I saw something new, and decided to show it. That&rsquo;s all.</p>
