  body: "> <em>difference between an oblique or slanted cut versus a true italic</em>\r\n\r\nHello
    Ricardo,\r\nThe terminology to describe letterforms whose stems are NOT perpendicular
    to the baseline have gotten very fuzzy with constant misuse over the last few
    decades.\r\n\r\nWith sans and grotesk/grotesque faces, oblique forms are often
    the design convention, which essentially is the roman form with re-adjusted stress
    for rounds, often slight condensing of width and redrawing of connecting stroke
    intersects. We made a little stink about \"true cut\" obliques versus \"slanted\"
    forms with the release of Avant Garde Gothic Pro Oblique (see Mark Simonson's
    post in <a href=\"http://typographi.com/001029.php\" target=\"new\">Typographica</a>).\r\n\r\nAs
    long as a typeface (generally sans) has \"true cut\" oblique weights that's fine,
    as long as that was the actual designer's intent. Creating \"italics\" (or after
    the Italian style as it originally was meant) are based on completely different
    design principles and models, and meant to compliment the roman, not necessarily
    \"re-invent\" or \"italicize\" it.\r\n\r\nWithout specific regard to what Vic
    Caruso did with ITC Franklin Gothic, strictly using or purchasing a set of weights
    based on terminology (oblique, slant or italic) is strongly not advised. You need
    to inspect the characters to determine whether they were \"drawn\" correctly and
    weighted properly.\r\n\r\nIf both ITC Franklin Gothic Oblique and Italic are well
    designed (I am not looking at specimen, just memory of pre-digital cuts), then
    it is up to YOU to decide what you prefer. Neither choice is actually wrong...
    but one may work better in your design than the other.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nHMMMMmmmmm...\r\nJust
    looked at your link to MyFonts for all ITC Franklin Gothic weights, and it is
    confusing with \"italic\" being used as the term in most cases, but \"oblique\"
    in certain cases.\r\n\r\nI think this is a Linotype naming issue, or years ago
    the Linotype release was verly slightly different (maybe in spacing), since in
    the original ITC Release specimens, only the term \"Italic\" was used.\r\n\r\nIf
    you go to the <a href=\"http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/font/pid/421590/ITC+Franklin+Gothic+Complete+Family+Pack/detail&grab_id=0&page_id=44371&query=%22franklin%22&SCOPE=ITCFonts\"
    target=\"new\">ITC website</a>, you will see that they ONLY use \"italic\" in
    descriptions of the non-roman weights of ITC Franklin Gothic."

    uproar on the part of his customers! He ended up providing both.\r\n\r\n* Which

    with Norbert if he felt that I felt that obiques need to be designed from scratch

    family weights and optical scaling, they should be regarded as steps in development.
    Final assessment should always be done visually and appropriate adjustments made.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, it's true... \"rush to market\" frequently birth more baboons than swans."

  body: "Thanks for your comments, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nNorbert, thank you for the link
    to the Typographica article about Avant Garde Pro Oblique; I had forgotten about
    that... In it, Mark Simonson links to his explanation on <a href=\"http://www.marksimonson.com/article/128/fake-vs-true-italics\">fake-vs.-true
    italics</a>, which illustrates the differences quite well.\r\n\r\n<em>I think
    this is a Linotype naming issue...</em>\r\n\r\nYou know, I had also been looking
    at Adobe's offerings of ITC Franklin Gothic and, interestingly, in <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_023.html\">PostScript</a>
    they offer both italic and oblique, while their <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1138.html\">OpenType</a>
    versions have italics only. So it's good to know that the ITC website only displays
    the italics! (Thanks for that link, too -- I was having trouble with ITC's website,
    earlier...)\r\n\r\n<em>Just looked at your link to MyFonts for all ITC Franklin
    Gothic weights, and it is confusing with \u201Citalic\u201D being used as the
    term in most cases, but \u201Coblique\u201D in certain cases.</em>\r\n\r\nA printout
    of an online character map will only reveal so much, but it does look as if the
    Oblique versions of ITC Franklin Gothic are a bit more slanted than their Italic
    brethren... The italic <strong>uppercase O</strong> looks rounder than the oblique
    one, which could be confused with the <strong>zero</strong> in the same cut (I'm
    looking at the Book weights)... The <strong>@ symbol</strong> has the most noticeable
    difference: only slightly inclined in the italic, while very slanted in the oblique.\r\n\r\n<em>If
    both ITC Franklin Gothic Oblique and Italic are well designed [...], then it is
    up to YOU to decide what you prefer. Neither choice is actually wrong\u2026 but
    one may work better in your design than the other.</em>\r\n\r\nRight you are;
    I can agree to agree about that.  :-)  Same goes for the naming distinctions you
    posted; that's the way I had learned them, too.\r\n\r\n<em>...usually when a font
    has both (not common) it\u2019s because an oblique version was rushed out but

    is my feeling as well, Hrant. I just wanted to hear some other opinions on this
    before taking the plunge. :-)\r\n\r\nThanks again, guys!"
