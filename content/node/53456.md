    I think this is kind of confidential, but well, it's just ideas... :)\r\n\r\n1-
    The first CV i ever sent was a bottle of Tonic Water, i changed the label of the
    bottle and put my own info (same design, same font). for example, the code bar
    had my ID number...\r\n2- A friend of mine sent a CV to a design agency cald \"Claw\",
    so she hand-made a cat holding her cv.\r\n3- i heard of a girl that sent a bottle
    of ferment, saying that she would make the agency grow... (i realy like this idea!)\r\n\r\njust
    have to be creative, and make something special for each place you send you cv...
    i think this realy works :P"

  body: "\"just have to be creative\"\r\n\r\nWell, I'd say the resume is pure raw
    data and isn't always the place to be creative. The portfolio? Sure. But resumes
    have a very specific purpose and should be streamlined to suit that sole purpose.
    \r\n\r\nSadly, that's often a Word file with keywords to survive a pass through
    the corporate key-word-scanner. ;0)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I had a conversation about this very topic with one of my teachers yesterday.
    Her advice was that the first person to look at your resume will probably be someone
    in HR, not necessarily a design-minded person, so you shouldn't get too \"cute.\"
    Just do everything you would do for a conservative text design; keep it clean,
    and be just as anal over the little things as you normally are. You can maybe
    get a little creative with your name, but not too much.\r\n\r\nI've actually seen
    a pretty cool design that uses a two-column layout. It's just distinctive enough
    to be unique, but still a bit conservative. I'm trying to work my own resume into
    that sort of design now, but I don't think I have enough content to warrant it.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and do it in InDesign, not Word."

  body: 'In the end it depends on to were you''ll be sending your CV. well, i can
    only talk about what I see here around me: a) most agencies here are too small
    to even have a HR or someone dedicated to recieve the CVs, normaly they are simply
    sent to the Criativity Director; b) in a design office here, everybody expects
    you to be different when you apply to a job; c) i think that if your CV is the
    first thing employers see, it should be a window to what/who you are.  "very specific
    purpose" does not mean, in my opinion, that it should be "uncreative".'

    tend to send to design firms and the plain Jane .doc file that I tend to send
    to more IT related firms and recruiters.\r\n\r\nI had a recruiter the other day
    say that \"Oh, can you send me the nice version with the graphics and stuff?\".
    It's nice to be reminded that, at least when put side-by-side, people do notice
    the better designed piece. \r\n\r\nI guess my next challenge is to make my .doc
    resume a bit more 'designed'."
