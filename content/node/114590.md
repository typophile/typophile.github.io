  body: "I'm sorry, but may I ask what you find so attractive about this font? \r\nThe
    style of the italic g is a bit unusual, but not extremely so. The problem with
    searching for this is that italics are rarely used for identification, by themselves,
    and that is all your sample shows. It is hard to see the details clearly. Is there
    a better picture showing the serifs more clearly? That is almost the only thing
    that might help zero in on this typeface. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n"

  body: Thank you for your efforts! I have finally managed to contact the person this
    belongs to. I thought they wouldn't answer so I tried to identify it with the
    help of others, but they did reply. Thanks again though!
