  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"> As a graphic design student, I have rather belatedly just realised the importance of good typography in design. Silly me for thinking my tutors might have warned me, but it seems I have been mistaken. Now, with six months left until I graduate, all I seem to be doing nowadays is find out new typo-facts that I probably should have learnt ages ago. My only hope is that I can learn enough to get by before I get my first job.  <BR>Can anyone tell me whether I need to go and try my hand at some letterpress, as my college doesn&#39;t have one. There are plenty of books about, but I don&#39;t know if I am missing out on anything? </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Steve, it&#39;s great that you&#39;ve developed a &#34;taste&#34; for type! The thing is -and I&#39;m no technophile- what&#39;s with letterpress? I&#39;m sure some people will say that you can&#39;t understand type until you understand metal, but who can understand anything completely anyway? It&#39;s really a matter of priorities. With the limited time us humans have to get into something, I think metal is simply too marginal now to warrant extensive study by somebody in your situation. I&#39;d worry more about proper spacing/kerning for example &#40;something largely unworkable in letterpress, btw&#41;. <BR> <BR>Letterpress has its uses, even today, but I don&#39;t like seeing typography limited by &#42;any&#42; technology, past or present. In its &#34;pure&#34; form, it&#39;s all conceptual, and the physical world can be just as limiting as it is real. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Yes! Type has the capacity for expression in  <BR>the same ways we use color and photography  <BR>and space. &#40;But I&#39;m preaching to the  <BR>converted.&#41; <BR> <BR>If you have the chance to use a letterpress, by  <BR>all means go out of your way to do so. There&#39;s  <BR>an aesthetic quality about letterpress that  <BR>cannot be had by today&#39;s presses or screens. <BR> <BR>But, I&#39;d agree with Hrant that it&#39;s not a  <BR>requirement for honing typographic skills.  <BR>Typographic skill comes from using and  <BR>working with type. I think that&#39;s seperate from   <BR>an appreciation for type that can come from <BR>studying the subject.  <BR> <BR>So, if using a letterpress forces you to pay  <BR>attention to those details, then by all means... <BR> <BR> <BR>//joe </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Um, just for the sake of disagreeing. <BR> <BR>Letterpress is really useful in one respect, and it&#39;ll give you an understanding of what type really is about. Metal/moveable type is the origin of typographic measurement systems, pts and EMs and ENs, it&#39;s also the origin of terms like &#34;leading&#34; and &#34;body&#34;. <BR> <BR>Get your head around those things and you&#39;ll already be a few steps ahead of your peers - and that knowledge is not redundant, or ever likely to be. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Nothing is redundant. But some things are more useful than others. Letterpress &#42;was&#42; &#34;what type <BR>is really about&#34;. But today it&#39;s largely the &#42;opposite&#42; of what type is really about now: dynamic, context-sensitive forms with complex spacing systems. <BR> <BR>The biggest influence of letterpress &#40;one could say of any technology&#41; was in the &#42;limitations&#42; it imposed. The best thing one can learn from studying letterpress is to more accurately second-guess what the talented designers of yesteryear &#40;like Dwiggins&#41; &#42;could&#42; have done with better technology. <BR> <BR>For example, the reason many metal fonts have a deficient lc &#34;f&#34; &#40;a very important letter in readability&#41; isn&#39;t because the designer was stupid, it&#39;s because it was too expensive to do it right in metal. If you look at Octavian, you&#39;ll see the improvements Carter and Kindersely made to the &#34;f&#34; once the design was freed from behind its metal prison. &#40;Granted, many designs that worked well in metal got trashed when converted to photo/digital, but that was due to idiocy and cost-cutting, not the fault of the newer technologies.&#41; <BR> <BR>The way to get ahead of your peers is by walking forward. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Hrant, I think you just try to deliberately distort anything you read to your own agenda, positively or negatively. <BR> <BR>What I wrote was that getting your head around typographic measurement systems will put this student ahead of his peers. He doesn&#39;t appear to be at the stage where he neds to start considering &#34;advanced&#34; typography, he&#39;s at the stage where he needs to get his head around the basics. <BR> <BR>As the basis of type, even today &#40;and tomorrow&#41;, is pts and EM squres it is &#42;very&#42; useful to get the concepts behind those units right before you move on. From what Steve has already written it seems clear that its a good grounding that he&#39;s lacking. <BR> <BR>So, I write again, &#34;Letterpress is really useful in one respect... the origin of typographic measurement systems&#34;. <BR> <BR>I think your problem is that you want to run before you can crawl. </div>
