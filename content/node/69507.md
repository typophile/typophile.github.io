  would you pair with Joos? I\u2019m thinking something with a (slightly brushy) Dutch
  feel to it might work. What do you think?"

    are the line breaks the final version? Seem a bit confusing to me; how about:\r\n\xBBType

  body: "No worries, Indra. I\u2019m just looking for something (a serif) that could
    sit right next to it, at the same size and just \u2026 look right.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    interesting Nick. I\u2019ll look into Goudy. \r\n\r\nAn interesting question:
    How should italics relate to it\u2019s roman counterpart?\r\n\r\n"

    have to add a slight stroke to tune up its weight to match Joos. Or slim Joos
    down."
