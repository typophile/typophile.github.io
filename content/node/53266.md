  September 1935 Gill drew for Monotype a stressed sans-serif type with many prophetic
  qualities: it looked forward to Hermann Zapf's 'serifless roman' Optima of nearly
  a quarter of a century later. Although it was given a series number (430), and a
  few trial sorts were cut, it was never issued to the trade.\"\r\n\r\nHas anybody
  here seen these trials or reproductions thereof? "

  body: I saw the original Gill drawings for this series in a folder in the Monotype
    Type Drawing Office. From what I can remember it was not very good. To say it
    was like Optima would be giving it too much credit, probably closer to Albertus
    in its design. My last view of it was over 20 years ago, perhaps someone from
    Monotype can tell what has become of the originals.

    the collection seems to be intact. The library doesn''t consist of many original
    designer drawings, these were usually returned to the designer, but you never
    know. Robin Nicholas should be able to let you know, and I''m sure you could set
    up a visit if you''re in the area. '

    Series 430, as well as a copy of the trial setting. I've posted a scan of the

    be worthwhile to look backward a few years to R. Hunter Middleton's Stellar, cut
    for the Ludlow Typograph.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting progression from Stellar
    to series 430 to Optima. The idea of the stressed sans was certainly in the air
    among typeface designers and manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThere are a few takes on Optima
    available today:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/stellar-classic-sg/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/stellar/\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: Yes indeed, I am the associate for the Knowledge Transfer Partnership, as
    of last month. I'll spend the next two years working with Monotype on non-Latin
    fonts, and digging for more treasure in the archives when I have the chance. (I
    get really giddy when I see some of the stuff tucked away in there, especially
    stuff like this that never made it to the light of day.)

    the position of a colon. In Nick's Stellar example, the comp should have raised
    that hyph in AD-WRITER. This looks terrible. To say nothing of the spaces L &
    R of the hyph.\r\n\r\nThanks, Nick, for posting an example of the \"real thing.\"
    That's better than my ref to www pages. In the examples they show, subtle [or
    maybe not so subtle] changes may have been introduced as faces became adapted
