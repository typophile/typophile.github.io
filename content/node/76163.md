  media like a cancer?\r\n\r\nA good example is shown in the HTC \"You\" ad campaign.
  \ Each lettering \r\nstyle took seconds to minutes to draw.  The point is the product.\r\n\r\nI
  believe some of the ad ingredients have to be unusual to make us look \r\nat the
  product being featured.  The product is the point.\r\n\r\nEven James Victore makes
  a good living from creating bad art.  If that's \r\nyour bag, that's fine.  It's
  not mine.\r\n\r\nPaul Rand helped pioneer modern and informal graphic and advertising
  \r\ndesign.  I like some of his work very much.\r\n\r\nThe modern and informal trends
  in design are back in a big way.  \r\nA really big way!  \r\n\r\nBeauty is in the
  eye of the beholder.  Sometimes, the beholder doesn't \r\nknow what beauty is.  \r\n\r\nSome
  people just don't take the time to see everything out there, like \r\nI do.  I'm
  very observant and have been since I was a child.  \r\n\r\nVery few things impress
  me, and when something does, I stand up and \r\ncheer.  I don't cheer, however,
  for what I think is bad out there.  This \r\nis the age where bad is the new good."

    hand lettering is supposed to look like YOU (presumably not a type designer) made
    it.\r\n\r\n"

    the work of those subsequent generations of hip young creatives who shape culture
    as sub-par. Therefore, horrible work will increase.\r\n(A utilitarian viewpoint.)"

    Mike Meir\xE9's work for 032c (previously discussed here somewhere, can't seem
    to find it now..), just uglier. This kind of style has actually been going on
    for some time now.. the wine labels from Casa Mariol, \"designed\" in MS Word
    and Excel would be another example. (But in their case it actually looks good
    and fits their approach, i think)"

    modern life and to show,\r\nby giving examples, that our age is no less rich than
    ancient times in\r\nsublime themes, it may be asserted that since every age and
    every\r\npeople have had their own form of beauty, we inevitably have ours....\r\nAll
    forms of beauty, like all possible phenomena, have within them\r\nsomething eternal
    and something transitory -- an absolute and a\r\nparticular element. Absolute
    and eternal beauty does not exist, or\r\nrather it is nothing but an abstract
    notion, creamed off from the\r\ngeneral surface of different types of beauty.\""
