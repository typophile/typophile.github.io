  body: "There were MANY movies in that era -- many more than today, almost everyone
    went to the movies at least once a week [no TV]  -- and almost all of them had
    hand lettered titles. Only a few have been digitized. A nice one in somewhat similar
    style to Bambi [but with a different B] is Mark Simonsen's <a href=\"http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/lakeside\">Lakeside</a>,
    inspired by hand-lettered titles in Otto Preminger\u2019s classic 1944 film noir
    movie \u201CLaura.\u201D\r\nDon"
