  body: '"Ugh"? I usually say "Urgh..." with an ''r''. Maybe it''s a non-native English
    speaker thingie. Or "Blech", which covers it pretty much as well. :^P'

  body: Sory Bryan - by ugh I meant that that font is really really dated and kitsch.
    No offense taken I hope. Sometimes I can't help editorializing.

  body: I think giving our opinion on typefaces is an important educational aspect
    of Typophile. If somebody doesn't like a typeface and speaks his/her mind, the
    other can ask for clarification and -- ta-daah -- we are conducting a healthy
    critical discourse.

  body: "University Roman is often used to convey a 'classy' feel by people with no
    aesthetic sense, ie amateurs with no design training, (not that all amateurs have
    no aesthetic sense, as not all designers with formal training have).  But, having
    said that, it is so 70's it is probably due for a comeback in a kitsch ironic
    way. Hopefully not though.\r\n\r\nHere's my opinion - This is my most detested
    font of all time. It's disgusting, but I would be well pleased if any of my stuff
    were even a tenth as popular as this has been over the years.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "Kind of the Papyrus of the 70s.\r\n\r\nThere are some fonts of that 'vintage'
    such as Hobo or Revue that are so bad they're good and you can almost imagine
    using them... (maybe) ... but this one - gawd, I hope someone shoots me if I EVER
    use it for anything.\r\n\r\nI wonder what my most detested font of all time would
    be... gotta think on that one."
