  Monotype Imaging fonts.com  </strong> facility to render fonts such as Helvetica
  Neue on their website? For a brochure site I'm designing I want to move away from
  default web fonts. Any experience positive or negative please let me know.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks"

  body: I want to use Helvetica Neue thin - its part of their branding. Its available
    on the Monotype fonts.com platform. I also want to explore this as an option for
    other jobs and other fonts.
