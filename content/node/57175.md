  was engraved from a lettering style used in the Masterplate pantograph system.\r\n\r\nThe
  letters are engraved in reverse on 1/2\" thick steel then it (the die) is die stamped
  on this vintage, onion skin paper (about 9#) then hand folded in our bindery, here.\r\n\r\nYesterday
  evening I realized how much the strokes remind me of Magnolia tree branches, we
  have several such trees in our yard.\r\n\r\n"
