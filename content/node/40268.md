  body: "I know this font. It is unhelpfully called \"Handwriting\" and I don't have
    any foundry info on it. Obviously if you enter that into a search engine you get
    too much.\r\n\r\nSome more info: it's by Sam Wang, you can find a sample here
    (it's on the left), and they say you can download it but I found the instructions
    confusing. It's a shareware font.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.graphic-design.com/Type/Fonts-Fonts/scripts/handwrite.html\r\n"

  body: I agree that the other handwriting fonts are much nicer, but I have to create
    a folder in the design style of there website, which I did not do, so I am ckind
    of stuck with it.
