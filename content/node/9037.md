body: I&#39;ve just recieved an interesting project at Uni, to start we have to define
  5 of each, ugly/boring and beautiful/cool typefaces. We then take one forward and
  produce A2 posters for each, advertising a type exhibition, and then we combine
  the two typefaces together to create the final poster... <BR> <BR>At the moment
  my choices for ugly / boring are typefaces I see everyday, books, magazines, newspapers...
  Garamond for example, I just need to find the correct one with a little intersting
  history, I&#39;m hoping someone here, with a better understanding of type will know
  the seedy past of one of these sort of typefaces. Although, any typeface used in
  the correct fashion can be beautiful, and these typefaces are obviously well crafted...
  Its just you see them everyday, and they&#39;re made to disapear into the page rather
  than be &#39;interesting&#39; in there own right. <BR> <BR>For my Beautiful typeface
  i&#39;m looking at the moment to use woodblock type, I like the personality of it,
  however, its a method rather than a typeface, so I need to find the classic woodblock
  face, something along the lines of what &#39;Frost&#39; use in a lot of there designs...
  Either that or i&#39;ll be looking at a battle between old and new, then using something
  like Design Shock...  <BR> <BR>Its a hard choice to make. We also have to find typefaces
  with an interesting history... which cuts a lot out of the equation... <BR> <BR>Any
  ideas, and what would your top 5&#39;s be?

    search of thousands of fonts. This should help you narrow down based on your general
    ideas &#40;like &#34;wood type&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>As for boring, check out what
    the banks are using. 9 times out of 10 &#40;at least here in the states&#41; they
    are conservative and uninspired choices. Also, any business-to-business materials.
    You&#39;ll probably find more Rotis and Gill Sans than you can shake a stick at...

    to Gill, Perpetua and Joanna should be an interesting analysis. <BR>Tim

  body: Rob - did your proff offer a definition of what is ugly and what is beautiful?
    If not, I would start there. Create a set of criteria for each. I get the feeling
    that if you have a set rationale as to why you decided each was classified as
    either ugly or beautiful you will get a better grade. <BR> <BR>For instance, I
    am willing to wager that many here will see Garamond as beautiful - but for differing
    reasons. It is all so subjective. <BR> <BR>If you define your criteria - on paper
    - you will be able to show that you have thought out your choices and can defend
    them in a rational way. <BR> <BR>You proff will love you for that. Well, maybe.

  body: 'Yes I agree, Garamond on both points about the typface, I think it can be
    defined as both a beautiful and an ugly typface. <BR> <BR>The brief goes like
    this : and no the lecturer, suprisingly wants us to make our own decisions...
    <BR> <BR>Select a typefont that you consider ugly &#40;boring, dull&#41; and another
    you find beautiful &#40;sexy, cool&#41;. Produce an A2 full colour poster for
    each font containing the following :  <BR> <BR>it then goes on to explain that
    we need to include an A - Z or an mnemonic showing the type family in 3 of its
    design weights. &#40;Out of interst are there any other mnemonics apart from the
    &#39;Quick brown fox...&#39; &#41; <BR> <BR>So.. at the moment, the words &#39;Boring
    &amp; Dull&#39; are my main motives for choosing Garamond. But as you say Mike,
    a clearly defined criteria would help me choose, and get me more browny points.
    It seems I have a little developing to do. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/73/697.html</a> has some
    good versions, a mnemonic is an aid to memory. I would try to make the differentiation
    between ugly and boring &amp; dull. Beauty can be something that does its job
    without intruding on the duty of type &#40;to present information&#41; like Helvetica
    or like Miles Newlyn
