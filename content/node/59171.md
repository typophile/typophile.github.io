  capitals in <em><a href=\"http://www.impawards.com/2009/rudo_y_cursi.html\">Rudo
  Y Cursi</a></em> movie poster is? It looks very familiar -- I think it may be a
  Latin American design.\r\n\r\n"

    new or it has been relaunched.\r\nI remember searching for Darka und not finding
    it some time ago."

  body: "Thanks again. Hmm, new depends on your perspective. I recommended it <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typoforum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=4125\">two
    years ago</a> on another site and think it looked like that since that time. Maybe
    the reason why you didn\u2019t find Darka could be the flash-built construction
    of the site. A quick google-search after \xBBdarka font\xAB doesn\u2019t show
    the kimera-site \u2026"

    called FontShop.com, but unfortunately, they don't carry it (anymore?).\r\n\r\nLargato
