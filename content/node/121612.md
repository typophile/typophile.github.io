  the answer was : this font is only for this logo.\r\nI can't believe this.  Thanks
  in advance for your help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UL-vignetteUL-1-2-3_5827.png]"

    typeface. It may very well be custom.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone else will recognize
    it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-Univ-Lille_5312.jpeg]"

  body: "As far as I can see, this is a modified <a href=\"http://next.fontshop.com/tryout/templates/blank/967ca36e16a3\">FF
    DIN</a>. Some characters (\u2018i\u2019, \u2018s\u2019, \u2018l\u2019) were left
    alone; most were customised, many just by tacking spikes on (\u2018U\u2019, \u2018n\u2019,
    \u2018r\u2019, \u2018d\u2019), others more radically (\u2018v\u2019, \u2018e\u2019).
    In any case, it may very well be that only the letters required for the wordmark
    were created instead of an entire alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe subline is Gotham Narrow,
    designed by <a href=\"http://www.frerejones.com\">Tobias Frere-Jones</a>."
