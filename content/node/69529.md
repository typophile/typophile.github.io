  anything absurd or sophomoric.\r\n\r\nI recently took an interest to some of the
  fonts that people might have used in advertisements or monuments from the early
  and mid-20th Century, specifically those of the Art Deco aesthetic.   Problem is,
  I haven't been able to find any that suit my taste.    I'm looking for something
  relatively light and unencumbered, but still really iconic -- something like the
  [[http://sharetv.org/images/batman_the_animated_series-show.jpg|text]] in the logo
  of the old 90s Batman cartoon or the [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/RocCt-LeeLawrie-Wisdom.jpg|words]]
  on the wall at Rockefeller Center.   Actually, it's funny about that last example,
  because I actually found a font called Lawrie somewhere once that almost seemed
  to suit my purposes, but I've never seen it around again.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?
  \  Perhaps somebody around here has made one like that, or knows someone who has."

  body: The Batman one looks a bit like <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/itc-anna/">ITC's
    Anna</a>. Clicking the "Art Deco" link to the right of this font shows a lot more
    look-a-likes, plus lots of Broadway and ITC Kabel clones.
