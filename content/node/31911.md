  body: "I would recommend purchasing som eof the Graphis Packaging annuals. I think
    they are un to number 9 now. I own the first and seconds publications and they
    are a great source of inspiration to me, loads of great packaging designs from
    the 60's which easily associate with todays trends. \r\n\r\nyou could try looking
    for them here \r\n\r\nwww.abebooks.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&y=0&tn=Graphis+Packaging&x=0\r\n\r\nWhat
    I also find useful is just to take a day out and look round supermarkets or other
    similar stores. I was in Waitrose the other day and they had a number or really
    well designed products.\r\n\r\n"

  body: the design archive at <a href="http://www.aiga.org/">AIGA</a> is very good.
    along with packaging design, it has many other categories like information design,
    book design, typography, etc.
