body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI'm looking for help creating a few magazine spreads (a mockup
  essentially) for a school assignment, with emphasis on good typography. You might
  be thinking that it may prudent to educate myself on these things, read some books,
  and you may be right, but my time frame is very limited, so unfortunately I do not
  have time to do so. I hope, regardless, that this post is in the spirit of the site,
  as I do hope to learn something from this, despite rudely requesting end results,
  so to speak, of tested and tried combinations of fonts and style. If you deem this
  inappropiate, then disregard the remainder of this post and please know that no
  disrespect was intended. \r\n\r\nLooking at the forums on this site, I'm convinced
  that there are a great many typographically and design gifted people that frequent
  this place. I'm looking for one of those for not only advice, but if I find someone
  both creative and willing to assist the design of these spreads, there can be payment.
  But not a lot, as it is a non-profit/non-commercial school assignment, and my budget
  is not great. \r\n\r\nI'm looking for help in setting text, font choices (what fonts
  goes well together), proper leading, kerning and so forth of headings, subs and
  the body text for legibility, column widths (left justified or perhaps full justified
  if possible) and gutter. A tested and tried recipe, I suppose - but for the sake
  of doing the fonts justice. Suggestions on use of whitespace is certainly appreciated.
  I realise this is more of a design issue than legibility.\r\n\r\nThe spreads I will
  print on a highend color laser printer on matte coated paper. I don't know the exact
  details of the paper.\r\n\r\nMy idea is that the titling and headings may be a sans-serif
  font, and a serif font for the body text - legibility and easy decoding being key.
  I hope for a modern look, but not necessarily brand new fonts.\r\n\r\nPlease forgive
  me, these are all of different style and period and I don't know which fonts go
  well together. I liked some of the Gerard Unger fonts, but I also looked at some
  type foundry sites, like Linotype. I looked at Garamond, Granjon, Edison, Centennial,
  Bembo, Caslon, Farnham, Mrs. Eaves or some derivative of any of those for the body
  text. For titling or headings: Frutiger, Gothic, Aptifer or some other modern looking
  font. Yes, I realise that this is very vague and subjective. I'm sorry, I do not
  know how to otherwise describe them.\r\n\r\nI know there are many variations of
  most of these fonts. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nMy apologies for the very lengthy post.
  I hope anyone would like to provide some tips and suggestions. If this post is completely
  off key, please disregard, or if a mod deems it inappropiate, delete it.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks for reading it all."

    advice, but if this is for a homework assignment it would certainly be better
    for you to do most of the work yourself rather than hire someone to do your homework
    for you.  \r\n\r\nIf you mean it's for an extracurricular project -- like designing
    your school yearbook or a program for a school event -- you might want to talk
    to some local designers in your town to see if they'd be willing to contribute
    some time to help out."

  body: "My thanks for the excellent and informative responses.\r\n\r\nmike_duggan:
    I browsed the majority of these photos of magazines and newspapers, and they are
    tremendeously inspiring. I can only hope to achieve an endresult that approaches.
    Many thanks for the link, I appreciate it.\r\n\r\ndberlow: This link had some
    very interesting examples. They in particular brought my attention to the size,
    or dimensions of the physical media. The format of 8' by 1X' some inches, really
    seems to the most common. I assume, this is mostly about cost and the limitations
    of the print machines that presses them, and the sheet sizes you can push through
    them. Thank you, I found it informative.\r\n\r\nJamesM: I know, and can clearly
    see that this is a good place to seek advise. I understand that my post did not
    make my intention clear. I am not trying to pay someone to do my assignment, merely
    rewarding a knowledgable and kind person, if they were to assist me, as I clearly
    understand that the subject is vast. I wouldn't ask for such a large favor, and
    not return the favor, in a way that I am capable. \r\n\r\nfrode frank: This list
    of tips and suggestions for further reading is much appreciated. I do hope to
    study as much as time allows. I will try to find resources online that will allow
    me to research them further. \r\n\r\nAlthough, I must admit my time- and budgetlimit
    is quickly approaching, during my hunt for fonts. Buying two or three fonts will
    largely expire my resources. \r\n\r\nWhen I am done with the project, I intend
    to share it with the forum visitors here. Hopefully, it may be of some use to
    people that aren't well versed in typography, like me, but wishes to learn more.\r\n\r\nIf
    I am not being overly presumptuous, I wonder if there is not a person here that
    can assist me further. I have seen inspiring things, and found others, by following
    the links, posted in this thread, but I still seek more. Please forgive my impertinent
    persistance - also the mixing of US and UK spellings. I can't help it. :(\r\n\r\nLinks

  body: No offense but it still sounds like you want someone to do your classroom
    assignment. Folks here are glad to offer suggestions but generally don't want
    to do someone's job for them.  Why don't you make a sample layout and post it
    for comments & suggestions? :)

  body: "I'm thinking of using Fedra Serif B Book for body text and a heavy Helvetica
    Extra Compressed for titling and a less heavy version for subs. \r\n\r\nFor the
    body text I'd like there to be ample white space, and have it be very legible
    but also have the neccessary tightness and framing so it doesn't become too loose.\r\n\r\nI'm
    hoping to do column widths of about 2.5' and a height of about 5. I'm trying to
    set the type at 9/12, but I can't quite figure out if it is a good amount. This
    particular type face has somewhat larger ascenders and descenders than others
    I have looked into. I am hopeful for any suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot. "

    through Ellen Luptons very lovely guide on text and style on her website. I also
