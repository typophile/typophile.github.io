  i am working on for a book series project in my GD class.   It's gonna be for a
  series of books on photography in the baltics (latvia, lithuania, and estonia).
  \ I'm going with a typographic solution because the cover will feature photographs.
  I want the books to feel very contemporary and elegant.  However i have been struggling
  with finding an appropriate font and also with placement.  Here's what i have so
  far, note that the logo will be placed on semi-transparent vellum, revealing the
  photography below.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Are you trying to create a logo or a book title design?\r\n\r\n1. Use true
    small caps. Notice how the strokes in \"P\" and \"L\" are thicker than in the
    rest of the letters. A true small caps typeface will offer proportionate strokes.
    \r\n\r\n2. The \"f\" is impeding the readability of \"Photography\" and \"Latvia.\"
    The words are <cite>legible</cite>, but less readable because the ascender and
    descender in that \"f\" interrupt the words.\r\n\r\n3. I'm not sure what the red
    marks are. They look like brush strokes which is confusing."

  body: i guess this is more of a book title design. the brush strokes are a stylized
    take on the flag of latvia. I'm not sure about them though, i just wanted an element
    that would tie all 3 books together. Also does anyone have any other alternate
    font suggestions.

  body: "Since its about photography, the photos should be seen more, don't let \"design\"
    get in the way.\r\nThe typography is bad. keep it real simple, one typeface, put
    everything on a grid, make it titlecase.\r\n\r\nLoose the brush strokes."

  body: Yeah, the brush strokes look a little gory to me. Among other thing, the "of"
    needs to be scaled down a bit.
