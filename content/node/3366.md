    <BR>It isn&#39;t shareware, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen a TrueType version
    bundled with MS Office &#40;or some other app.&#41;

    really didn&#39;t know how to react to it, which  <BR>is why it&#39;s taken me
    so long to post. <BR> <BR>Excuse me if this may sound harsh, but this is a  <BR>community
    of type designers, type users and -first  <BR>and foremost- type lovers, and to
    me your request   <BR>betrays a lack of respect for type. To create a  <BR>succesful
    type family takes talent, skill, and  <BR>countless hours, days, months, sometimes
    even  <BR>years of hard work. If I understand it correctly,  <BR>you&#39;re just
    looking for a free ticket, thus depriving  <BR>Mark van Bronkhorst from his livelyhood.

    This is not the first time this happens.</a> <BR> <BR>As Nicolai pointed out,
    do you really think that  <BR>someone who went through all that trouble would  <BR>make
    the fruit of his labour available for free,  <BR>just like that. How would you
    feel if you didn&#39;t  <BR>get paid for your work say the next three months  <BR>or
    so? <BR>Any freeware or shareware font you&#39;re likely to  <BR>find on the internet
    will most probably have design  <BR>flaws, poor kerning, incomplete character
    sets,  <BR>maybe even technical defects. <BR>I hope you&#39;ll consider purchasing
    fonts in the  <BR>future. The addage &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; is  <BR>very
    true of freeware and share fonts. If you want  <BR>quality type, you must be prepared
    to pay for it. <BR> <BR>And if you want to use share/freeware type: I have  <BR>absolutely
    no problems with that. But then at least  <BR>be honest about it and don&#39;t
    try to masquerade it  <BR>as genuine quality type. <BR> <BR>This is a very personal
    statement and does not in  <BR>any way represent an official viewpoint of Typophile.'

  body: 'OK ... some dissenting points. <BR> <BR>1&#41; I certainly agree with the
    desire to have posters be honest about their <BR>intentions. However, requiring
    every poster to show a respect for type is <BR>just not realistic or even, IMO,
    reasonable. The vast majority of people out <BR>there just don&#39;t know enough
    about typography to have respect for it. As a <BR>result, we see plenty of posts
    from people who ignorantly believe that one <BR>can get a freeware/shareware font
    comparable to Verdigris. It seems to me <BR>that education would be more appropriate
    &#40;and effective&#41; than scolding. <BR> <BR>1a&#41; This type of font request
    is, IMO, very different from those occasionally <BR>seen on the MyFonts forum,
    where one poster actually stated, &#34;I&#39;m not going <BR>to pay money for
    fonts!&#34;. That type of post goes well beyond ignorance and <BR>reflects a relatively
    recent, largely generational attitude that it&#39;s not necessary <BR>to pay for
    fonts, music, software, etc. Those people &#40;and they&#39;re legion&#41; <BR>definitely
    need verbal spankings. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Mr. van Bronkhorst&#39;s creations are
    truly splendid and he does indeed <BR>deserve whatever price he asks. However,
    he rigidly offers his fonts as a <BR>package only. Certainly there are many situations
    in which paying $159 <BR>to obtain a single desired font is out of the question.
    I can think of two fairly <BR>recent posts here by well respected mainstays of
    this forum asking for <BR>alternatives in &#40;I believe&#41; similar situations.
    I can&#39;t find those posts just now, <BR>but I remember them verbally &#34;walking
    on eggshells&#34; for fear of condemnation. <BR> <BR>In the case of the home hobbyist,
    noncommercial user or even small firm, <BR>posters desiring a font they cannot
    reasonably afford have two choices: They <BR>can ask that someone e-mail them
    the font &#40;in which case they need a verbal <BR>whacking&#41; or  they can
    seek a cheaper alternative. I see no reason why we <BR>cannot help out the latter
    poster, educating them along the way. Fonts bundled <BR>with applications &#40;wihch
    the poster may even already have&#41; can be a great option. <BR>And most of those
    fonts supplied with MS apps &#40;mostly Monotype&#41; are of very <BR>high quality.

  body: Yves, I&#39;ve softened up on the ignorant free type request person. I once
    got one of those types to post over here. I was hoping he&#39;d get an education.
    After much education &#40;beatings&#41;, he explained his situation. Married,
    child in a deadend job and a cheap boss. It made me think that there are lots
    of poor people out there that can&#39;t afford font licences. So I now just direct
    them to a site like DaFont and let them discover what going through a junk yard
    looking for a Mercedes is like. <BR>

  body: Daniel, <BR>I strongly disagree with the &#34;junk yard&#34; analogy, as that
    would infer <BR>crappy near-uselessness of the merchandise. <BR> <BR>There are
    very many freeware/shareware fonts that are extremely <BR>useful to a niche that
    I sometimes think the professional designers <BR>and font makers here can not
    relate to at all &#40;and sometimes, dare <BR>I say, resent greatly&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>This niche doesn&#39;t in any way NEED top quality. And once they are <BR>shown
    what their zero dollars will buy, I find that many of these <BR>people are perfectly
    <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27621.html?1078316148" target="_blank">
    willing</a> to settle for &#34;good enough&#34;. This occurs <BR>regularly on
    the MyFonts forum. <BR> <BR>The fellow wanting to make a flyer for his local club
    is quite willing to <BR>use the closest free font for his project. I submit that
    he shouldn&#39;t have <BR>to phrase his request just so and show a respect for
    type in order to <BR>post here. <BR> <BR>So, a better analogy, IMO, would be a
    car sales lot. The prospective <BR>customer seeking a <i>much</i> cheaper alternative
    to that Mercedes <BR>might be shown a Kia instead. If he accepts that the Kia
    is the best <BR>he can afford and states that the Kia will meet his lowly needs
    just <BR>fine, why should he denigrated? <BR><br>

  body: I might as well put in my two cents here too, since this is an issue I am
    pretty opinionated about, like many of you who have commented earlier. <BR> <BR>I
    find myself most in agreement with Mike Freiman, although in the right circumstances
    I feel like Yves too. The difference is in the purpose or intent of the user,
    and unfortunately we are usually only able to take their word for it about those
    things.  <BR> <BR>If someone is willing to take a near-match because they can&#39;t
    afford the real thing for the purpose at hand, or if they are just looking for
    something with certain similar qualities, I think we can refer them to places
    where that can be found.  <BR> <BR>If they want to get the real fonts for free
    they can go somewhere else, and I think we ought to refer them to a special FAQ
    page about why that sort of question is improper, unethical and unfair &#40;and
    whatever other terms Yves used above&#41;. <BR> <BR>My &#39;gray area&#39; happens
    when the font they want is only available as a &#39;clone&#39; version, as far
    as we know. I will usually recommend those fonts. The FontBank fonts are a good
    example, because I think often the font the posters are trying to duplicate came
    from that collection in the first place.   <BR> <BR>I am all for education, and
    promotion of original, quality fonts. That&#39;s why I like to credit the designers
    -- so people realize this was someone&#39;s creative work. However, I realize,
    as Mike said, that there are situations when that expense can&#39;t be justified.
    Those are times when we should suggest alternatives, but I don&#39;t mean rip-offs
    of the same font. We should explain that if you aren&#39;t willing to pay for
    it, then you must be willing to settle for something else, but here are some things
    that might be similar that come with applications you may have, etc. I think it&#39;s
    a challenge, because most of us don&#39;t spend much time looking for cheap approximations,
    but if we have ideas for them, that would be the place for it. <BR> <BR>The last
    thing we need to try to be doing is guessing at their motives, because there is
    no assurance that they will tell us the truth. You either want the original,and
    will pay for it, or you are willing to take something similar that we might suggest.

    if the font vendor would do comparisons more. For example with Vertigris, I would
    like to see a reason on the site why it is better than Minion or Adobe Garamond

    but leaving it all to the buyer to figure out is maybe not the best way.  '
