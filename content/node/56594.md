  body: In GID mode, which I believe is the default, the glyphs are shown in the same
    order as they are sorted in your font. So a nicer order in your font would make
    for a nicer order in the glyphs panel.

  body: You can make your own order, and the Glyph palette will display that when
    in CID/GID mode. Just switch FontLab's Font Window to "Index mode" and move the
    glyphs around. Or make your own encoding file and then, while in "Names mode",
    do Glyph -> Sort Glyphs -> By Encoding.

    the order of glyphs in a font. GIDs are the backbone of OT fonts: the cmap table

    There are terms naming such things which John mentioned above. GSUB,GID, etc..
    What Adobe failed to do when creating their interface for InD or AI is to realize
    that the people who use their software are very rarely as fluent in this kind

  body: "GID is the glyph index in the font, which is visible in the Font Window's
    Index mode in FontLab Studio. \r\n\r\nCID is the character identifier in so-called
    CID-keyed fonts, i.e. Asian PostScript and OpenType PS fonts. It is kind of like
    Adobe's own encoding scheme for Asian characters, alternative to Unicode. \r\n\r\nI
    agree that the term \"by CID/GID\" is not very obvious to the user\r\n\r\nIt reminds
    me of the term \"OpenType CFF\". This is why I have been proposing \"OpenType
    PS\" as in \"PostScript-flavored OpenType\", but it seems that Adobe was concerned
    about the use of their PostScript trademark in this context. I think that Adobe
    was primarily worried that \"PostScript-flavored OpenType\" suggested that \"the
    other\" flavor, i.e. \"TrueType-flavored OpenType\" aka \"OpenType TT\" is not
    compatible with PostScript, somehow. But \"CFF\" just like \"sfnt\" is an obscure
    technical term which I think is an additional burden to the user to learn. Same
    for \"CID/GID\". \r\n\r\nI agree with John that \"Font order\" would be a sensible
    label in this context. \r\n\r\nI have just <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform\">submitted
    a feature request</a> to Adobe, proposing the terminology <em>Sort glyphs by</em>
    / <em>Font order</em> and <em>Unicode order</em>. I encourage everyone to submit
    a similar request \u2014 the more people submit, the more likely it will be that
    this feature request is noticed. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    definition order was used -- the one Adobe calls \"GID/CID\". I always had a hard
    time hunting down the character I needed, and was glad to see the Sort menu added,
    as I know sort-of in what Unicode range I have to look for most special chars.\r\n\r\nBut
    what's with the Character Name showing up if you hover over one? I'm looking for,
    say, an 'e with a dot above'. I type this into Google and find the unicode: U+0117.
    Then I sort the font by Unicode. When I <em>finally</em> locate it, the friendly
    popup says \"e with a dot above\". I know that! It would've be useful if they
    added a plain search field to the Glyphs panel."

    cares or displays GID order, so it seemed odd that InDesign would make it so prominent.
    I suggested that Unicode order would probably make more sense.\r\n\r\nNow that
    both options have been out there, it would be reasonable to ask users which they
    prefer as the default. I suppose since I have just wrapped up a survey, I could
    start another one! This one is much simpler, though.\r\n\r\nAre there any other

  body: "It is sort of a different issue for a user -- at least, an InDesign user.\r\n\r\nFirst
    of all, consider this: if you need a character which is encoded in Unicode, you
    can enter it directly from the keyboard. Usually faster, and usually better. Sometimes
    when you enter a character from the glyph pallet, certain OT features seem to
    get blocked. \r\n\r\nIf you need a character that isn't encoded, two possibilities:\r\n\r\nCase
    1: If it is a small cap, you have probably used one of the small cap features
    in InDesign, so again, you can enter the appropriate Unicode cap (or l.c.) & be
    done with it.\r\n\r\nAside: Sometimes a character has a Unicode index, but you
    don't know it, and figure it will be easier to find it in the glyph pallet. Well,
    it happens. In that case, you usually want all the characters of a certain kind
    together. Problem is, there are different \"kinds\". \r\n\r\nAn alphabetic sort
    order makes the most sense when you are trying to find a diacritical variant,
    at least, using the Latin Script. I don't know the other scripts well enough to
    comment.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know the Unicode index for an oddball character (the
    circled infinity used for \"archival paper\" for example), you just hope you'll
    spot it quickly. (But you won't, usually, because it is left out of most fonts.)
    \r\n\r\nCase 2: The other situation occurs with a font like Bingham Script. Now
    just which of those variants did the designer want? Hard to see all the subtle
    differences in the glyph pallet. This is one case where I'd personally like to
    see the variant characters have a Private Use encoding. That way, the \"just which
    one\" can be passed along the production chain. Failing this, having them all
    together helps, a little.\r\n\r\nFWIW"
