body: I have a question concerning which ascender height  I should use in Fontlab
  when making Type1-fonts. The manual says you should add some to the &#34;typographic&#34;
  ascender to make the fonts ascender. But what about the Opentype dialog, does it
  make any difference to the leading? Should I care at all about that dialog when
  making Type 1?
