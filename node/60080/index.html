  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Some of you may have seen my post a while back about a logo for my freelance work. I was going to use the name "Red Door Design" until it came to my attention that there are a handful of existing agencies with the same name. 

So I decided to use my last name instead — "Aranda Design" — and developed a logo. Interested to hear anything that anyone has to say.

		<div class="commentbody">i agreed with picard, the curves at the end and beginning of the D does not help to see the A. it took me a while to see the A, i saw the pencil and didn't look further first - now i cannot not seeing it anymore. I'm not sure about your choice of typo, sure the style make it somehow personal designer but there is maybe too much difference about the A of the typo and the A of the logo.
That said about details, IMO your mark is great.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the feedback. You guys are echoing exactly some of the things I was thinking myself. I just needed to see if I was over-thinking. 

Yes, the A is bolder than the D. That was the only way I could make all three “levels” work. I think if I ditch the curves at the ends of the D, the A should be more apparent. I rather like the typeface, but I see what you mean about the A's not being similar enough. The letters in the mark are based on Gill Sans. Maybe I should try that for the type. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yep, A is kind of hard to see, and without seeing it the mark looks kind of busy, because of the element count. Secondly, the mark has too much whitespace; basically the positive parts are way too thin and neg/pos balance is not there. Also, the concept is interesting, the bent pencil looks quite a bit unconventional and geometrically forced. Lastly, placing the mark between the words is not working for me personally. All in all, the mark has a lot of promise, but needs more tinkering with.</div>

I see what you're trying to do - but as eps has said ... it's not really reading/working at the moment.

		<div class="commentbody">Just a thought to share.  Have you considered alternate names?  Simplification is sometimes a great way to create impact and a clever name.  I would consider using just your initial “A” and the word “Design” in a classic font like Helvetica or Bodoni.  Maybe the A in red and Design in Black or Grey.  It could be a nice play on your name and a statement of precisely what you do ...  A Design.

		<div class="commentbody">Ed, have you considered using a heavier weight for the D? I think the A just needs more to knock out of. You're right that it's not working, but I think it may simply not be working *yet*. Also, I strongly recommend not flanking the mark with type. It's too noisy and disruptive to the flow. Also, I think the mark needs room to read, as it is trying to use angular relationships to create an implied formal relationship.
