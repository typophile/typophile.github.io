  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This logo is for a small architects firm. The majority of their work is for local homeowners (house extensions, refurbs, etc). They are a small company, with only about 5 employees.</p>
<p>Although this is pro bono and no real brief was provided, I talked to the owner of the company and he said that one of the main selling points of the business was that every client got the full and undivided attention of a fully qualified architect (I had presumed every architects business would do this but there you go).</p>
<p>Based on what I was told about their audience and business mantra, I tried to design something friendly and personable that would appeal to their clients without losing the professional look required for something people would be spending a lot of money on. At the moment it is just the logo, I plan on adding the company name later, but want to hear critique of just the logo for now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time on this and am in need of fresh eyes. Would be great to hear some critique.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Did you draw the letters, or use a font? The aperture of the R seems too tall to me – well maybe not too tall but too “open” compared to the A. The A also doesn&rsquo;t really match the R stylistically. The A seems almost Asian, and is a bit more dynamic whereas the R is similar to Goudy and is more traditional. I&rsquo;m curious about the circle on top of the A. Does it have significance, or is it just a design element? I wonder if there&rsquo;s a better way to communicate what kind of business is being represented, since it&rsquo;s rather ambiguous – unless that&rsquo;s what you intended. Is the firm known for a particular style of design? Are they conservative, traditional? Or a bit more creative and experimental? The letter forms should reflect the personality of the firm and it&rsquo;s work. This is totally my subjective opinion, but a mark with a firmer structure might be better suited for an architect firm.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This says <em>professional</em> to me, but it doesn&rsquo;t say <em>personal</em>. 
The old-style <strong>R</strong> (Goudy?) also says <em>old</em>, as does the compass (I assume 21st Century architects draw circles and arcs with a computer). If your client&rsquo;s core business is renovating historic homes, the message of old-school craftsmanship might be just right.
Otherwise, I&rsquo;d look for imagery with less emphasis on the process (<em>here&rsquo;s how we do it</em>) and more on the outcome (<em>your new kitchen/living room will make you feel so comfortable/proud</em>).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the comments so far, I&rsquo;ll definitely put them to use later today when I work on the design.</p>
<p>Ed_Aranda - The &lsquo;A&rsquo; was drawn by myself and the R is Garamond (if I remember correctly - I&rsquo;m at work now so can&rsquo;t check) with a bit of customization. The &lsquo;A&rsquo; is supposed to be a compass. The work they do is definitely on the traditional side - they do indeed renovate old homes and are also known for doing church renovations so I thought this would work. I hear what you say about a firmer structure though. I&rsquo;ll post a few more ideas later.</p>
<p>Mojo - you&rsquo;re right about the old school craftsmanship vibe, I do think it works for the company as their business revolves around renovation of older buildings rather than modern design of steel and panel buildings. I&rsquo;m glad you recognized it as a compass! I think what you say about looking for imagery concerning the outcome will help make the logo more personable, I&rsquo;ll have a think about other concepts.</p>
<p>I think the nautical vibe might be coming from the traditional serif font and of course the compass being a map readers tool! Alaskan, you are seeing the logo as blue? Might be the JPG because it is actually black. Is the &lsquo;A&rsquo; reminding you of an anchor?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of changing the R to a Sans and changing the A a little to make it feel a little more modern, as well as hopefully losing the nautical vibe.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, the A looks like an anchor awkwardly leaning on a post. The pencil compass isn&rsquo;t obvious at all; for starters, the ring on top is too thick and as I recall, they have knobs on top, not rings. But, even if it read as a protractor, I&rsquo;d be saying it&rsquo;s a cliche choice. This compass-as-a-letter idea has been so beaten to death that I (personally) don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s even worth exploring.</p>
<p>Architecture is filled with beautifully structured visuals; why would you choose a tool that most people associate with elementary school?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah I think I need a few more concepts as this one probably is overused. I did look at a lot of other architects firms logos and the vast majority didn&rsquo;t have any imagery so I thought I&rsquo;d try and incorporate something that says &lsquo;architects&rsquo; without having to actually write it. From the responses so far I obviously haven&rsquo;t got there yet. Back to the drawing board for now&hellip;</div>

I&rsquo;m with AndreaC with regard to the shade of cyan: it&rsquo;s a little harsh on the screen and it could fade away on paper. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo/|Museo]] has a structured look that suits architecture, but I wonder if it&rsquo;s too trendy, and since it&rsquo;s a free typeface, possibly too ubiquitous.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To me, you&rsquo;re done with the bottom one. Architecture is actually a Humanities field, opposite to what people think. Engineering is an Exact field (I have a BA in Architect and an AAS in Graphic Design). The logo is structured, well-aligned, symmetrical, suggests spatiality, layered, all things that relate to architectural drawings and how they work.</div>

Though I&rsquo;d go with a darker grey / almost black for the &ldquo;Randfield&rdquo; logotype, and I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m digging the teal color scheme too much. Any other variations on colors? (maintaining the same &ldquo;r&rdquo; to &ldquo;a&rdquo; transparency format)</p>
