body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI'm creating a series of posters incorporating examples of
  famous or well designed typeface samples/promotion/teasers (not sure what the correct
  term is). For example, \r\n\r\nHelvetica: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helv_6512.png]\r\n\r\nAvant
  Garde (I realise this wasn't designed to purely show off the typeface, but it still
  fits my idea):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avant_4406.png]\r\n\r\nBlack
  Slabbath:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slabbath_5384.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's
  for a student project - promoting a typography exhibition. There will be classic
  type exhibits as well as events launching new faces etc. The samples will be used
  in a similar theme to this (still work in progress):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fdg_4057.png]\r\n\r\nAny
  other examples of good design specifically to show off a typeface (particularly
  for serifs) would be very helpful."

  body: just about any good type specimen you download nowadays has some really well
    designed pages showing the type off.

  body: "Yeah, cheers for that!\r\n\r\nIts mainly iconic, almost logo-like examples
    I'm looking for though, rather than standard specimens showing the full set of
    glyphs etc, if you know what I mean."

  body: "Well sort of, more like examples of the typeface being shown off to promote
    or display it. A piece of design created to advertise a particular font, or a
    logo for 'Bodoni' or 'Times' set in that particular face. Another example I thought
    of was Wim Crouwel's New Alphabet:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/images_3436.jpeg]\r\n\r\n\r\nOr
    this kind of thing for Futura:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/images-1_4469.jpeg]"
