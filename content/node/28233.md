body: "Hello folks,\r\n\r\nAm a graphic design student from India. I'm designing posters
  and the prospectus for this year's admissions for my school. Though its just a rough
  start but wanted a little feedback before i proceed further. \r\n\r\nAlso every
  year we have a special tag line to put on the admission prospectus and the posters.
  This time its 'ADD-MISSIONS TO YOUR LIFE'. Its funny but this is what my director
  had suggested for this year and i cant do anything about this. So i was just playing
  with the word \"add\" and \"+\" symbol in my designs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are a few
  of the explorations, please comment whatever you feel.\r\n\\\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ID_1_4897.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ID_2_6091.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ID_3_5424.jpg]\r\n\r\n\\\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nSatya_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    \"ss\" of \"admissions\" in the first design is hard to read. If you make it instantly
    readable, your design will be stronger. Plus the s's with the little cross in
    the middle look like a swastika (which I understand is an old Indian symbol but
    with unfortunate connotations today). Readable trumps clever every time.\r\n\r\nThe
    yellow color of the second design is hard to read against the yellow background
    and sort of hard on the eyes. Try different hues, tints and saturations.\r\n\r\nIn
    the third design, I think you should make the \"a\" more readable even if that
    means sacrificing the little \"+\".\r\n\r\nClever ideas for the \"+\": how about
    the dot of the \"i\"? Or as a period or exclamation mark? Or make the whole word
    plus shaped:\r\n\r\n  AD\r\nMISSIO\r\n  NS\r\n \r\n ADM\r\nMISSI\r\n ONS\r\n\r\nOr
    just by making the middle letters extra big: admISSions (but bigger,  squarer
    ISS of course so it looks like a plus)."

  body: Ooops, the "admissions" on three lines thing don't look like how I typed them
    (proportional font down in the "post comment box). Each line is supposed to be
    centered.

  body: "I am wondering whether you could introduce a second d into admissions in
    a second colour behind the word, for example your second layout could then do
    without repeating the add\u2013missions, leaving a more positive message \u2018To
    Your Life\u2019. You could then work up the lowercase a as your graphic image,
    possibly using a + as the counter, I also think that using the + once is probably
    more striking than repeating it in admissions. The form of the lowercase a might
    inform your treatment of the other type which feels a little sterile in the larger
    size.\r\nTim"

  body: "I'm not very much into the pixelfont thing. But I think the style and use
    of color is nice.\r\nI just think that there are so many nice typefaces to choose
    from, and the pixelones most of the times just look a bit.. I don't know, not
    too nice. \r\nBut thats just my opinion of course.\r\nAbout the typography itself,
    the third one (with the pink) is the weakest one in my opinion. The legibility
    of it is less then the other two. I find myself spelling the word out in my mind
    when reading it. The + in the A, however, is nicely found.\r\n\r\nWhat format
    is the poster going to be? Because I quite like the proportions they have now.
    The square/semi-square, I mean.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I personally couldnt see the \"plus sign in any of the designs, and now I
    know what to look for I feel it is a bit weak. In the first case it makes admission
    read admi5gion to me, and I see no real reason for the layout of type you have
    choisen, I personally dont feel it adds anything to any of the pieces.\r\n\r\nYou
    have a world of design principles you could apply and all of the above look as
    though you have tried very few. Perhaps the idea of a plus sign would work better
    with postive and negative space, or tints which could work well with your tag
    line, and increase readablity. This then opens possible options of cool print
    processes. Does it really need to show everything through the type, or could you
    do it through the medium? Die cut posters with \"ad\" die-cut and missions printed,
    in either the 'ad', or 'add' as someone suggested above.\r\n\r\nIn any case I
    feel you need to explore more, to use a term from one of my tutors back in the
    day, \r\n\"Do you need to show the whole hamburger?\""
