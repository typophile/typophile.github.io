  eps/psd for their logo.  Logo's about 6yrs old I believe, and the designer was out
  of Quebec.  I've included both the English and French versions.\r\n\r\nThere appear
  to be at least two fonts being used here, one for \"STEEL\" and one for \"Plus Network
  Inc\".  Possibly three - I'm not sure the \"S\" and \"TEEL\" come from the same
  font.\r\n\r\nFor \"STEEL\", WhatTheFont gave me Snv D Extra Cond as the best match,
  but it doesn't quite match up for line thickness, length of the middle bar on the
  \"e\", etc.\r\n\r\nThanks much for taking a look!"

    the <strong>NETWORK INC</strong> is Helvetica, while the <strong>PLUS</strong>
    is something else (looks a little like a cut of Futura). To top it off the <strong>PLUS
    INC</strong> in the French version isn\u2019t one typeface.\r\n\r\nSorry, can\u2019t
    help with the <strong>STEEL</strong>."
