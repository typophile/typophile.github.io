body: "I need to create 5 fonts based on architectural handwriting that will be used
  in AutoCAD. \r\n\r\nI will be using ScanFont to create the font then TypeTool to
  adjust the kerning and finally exporting the font as a True Type font. The AutoCAD
  website states that True Type fonts are supported but I wanted to run this process
  by some type professionals.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your assistance.\r\nAryon "
