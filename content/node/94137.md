  to the right were moving scores. I am not sure if they were even a font. The numbers
  to the left (in the second picture only) were static. If I can find out what all
  three are then I will be so delighted!\r\n\r\nhttp://goodeveningeurope.com/fonts/1958score.png\r\n\r\nhttp://goodeveningeurope.com/fonts/1958score2.png\r\n\r\nAnd
  I think this is the same font as on the scoreboard: http://goodeveningeurope.com/fonts/1958title.png\r\n\r\nThese
  examples are from the year 1958, a show in Netherlands. I am not sure if that helps.\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much in advance for your help. If you need some more samples of this font do
  let me know.\r\n\r\nIs the font available online? Can I read about it and its designer
  anywhere?\r\n\r\n"
