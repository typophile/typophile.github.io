body: hi folks, I would like to show my last work, it&#39;s a logotype for a company
  of prefabricated wooden house. <BR>company&#39;s name was a problem, it&#39;s too
  long &#34;grandes casas prefabricadas&#34;, means big  prefabricated houses. <BR>
  <BR>crits welcome.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64399.jpg"

  body: Sergio, you fall into the trap that I see designers posting here often do.
    Why does all type have to flush left and right?. First thing I would do is find
    the smallest size you will ever use the mark and make that work. Then I would
    do the same thing with the largest use. I would also make it work in black and
    white first. I&#39;m not in love with 3 sizes of type. I would tend to make Casas
    dominate and make Grandes and Prefabricadas the same size. Just some thoughts

  body: 'Generally, I like the logo. It&#39;s visually striking and shows some sophistication.
    <BR> <BR>I agree with Daniel about the type not needing to align like that, but
    if &#39;grandes casas&#39; is what you want to emphasize, then it&#39;s not a
    big deal. I understand the desire to have a strong rectangular &#39;notional space&#39;
    for the logo. However, &#39;prefabricadas&#39; does start to lump up and become
    hard to read at that size.Though, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a hard problem to avoid
    at small sizes. <BR> <BR>The kerning needs work. &#39;Casas&#39; has gaps like
    this: CA SA S and &#39;prefabricadas&#39; has a gap like this PREF ABRICADAS.
    These should be fixed.'

  body: Sergio, <BR> <BR>I wonder what this might look like, if you combined Grandes
    and Casas onto the same line &#40;about the same size as Prefabricadas, but emphasized
    through color only vs. size&#43;color&#41;, then juxtapositioned the logotype
    with the graphic mark, and possibly even broke through the rectangle of the graphic
    with some of those horizontal lines. This would make a much less tidy design,
    which might not imply prefab as well, but it might be worth exploring. <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: I think in this instance the full-justification of the type works. It makes
    sense and sits in line with the squareness of the biscuit part of the mark. I
    wonder what a heavier weight might look like?

  body: Hi, I really like your logo, and i presume you&#39;re brazilian just like
    me. I just think that the clear lines are just too clear... It&#39;s beggining
    to lose the limits of the square. I checked the colors, and it seems that in CMYK,
    they are below or around 10 %, which is a huge problem if you intend to print
    it in newspapers, photocopies, fax. And I agree about the gaps. <BR> <BR>Daniel
