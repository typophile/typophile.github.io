  am looking for the font in the LCDs. There maybe more than one font in use any help
  on any of the fonts would be great as I am trying to recreate the interface as a
  personal project.\r\n\r\nI am specifically looking for the number font that says
  \"13:46:12\".  No font I looked at has the elongated 6 or the : in the right place.
  Closests I found was Alternate Gothic No 2 ... but its not that. I feel like all
  of the numbers are in this font.\r\n\r\nThank you for any help!\r\n"

    could be edited to duplicate these numbers. The link to similar fonts shows some
    alternatives.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "After searching through all \"gothic\" fonts. And after searching through
    all fonts in general I think I found it. Today felt like look at all the fonts
    day! I think it is Scout Condensed Light. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/scout_condensed_light_ot\r\n\r\nI
    feel like the glow and focus blur of the interface is making it bolder than it
    actually is. Its not quite Scout Condensed Regular.\r\n\r\nI also feel the rest
    of the text is written in combination of regular and condensed Scout.\r\n\r\nThank
    you Don for your help!"
