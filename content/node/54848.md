  assignment, we were to cut out 20 different fonts of a letter of our choosing, and
  then find 20 images starting with that letter. I used O, bad idea, but it turned
  out okay.\r\n\r\nYes. That is Rosie O. Donald. And yes I know that Healthy Skin
  Glow Sheers Foundation does not start with O, but it's still O-range! Orange makeup
  squirting O's onto the Oven. (That is saying O shit. Yes I know it's an anti-obama
  sticker.. but it's still so funny!)"
