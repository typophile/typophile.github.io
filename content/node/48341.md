  body: What do you mean by block sans-serif? And by full support of Cyrillic are
    you looking at extended Cyrillic or just the basic stuff for say Russian?

  body: "Hi sii, thanks for the fast response!\r\n\r\nBy block sans-serif I was thinking
    of something akin to \"Why Square\" from Linotype (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/why-square-lt/)
    - I couldn't quite think of the best way to describe it!\r\n\r\nI would need extended
    Cyrillic /ideally/ but I can live with just the basic alphabet\r\n\r\nThanks again
    :)"

  body: I think you'll have a hard time finding a monospaced designs in that style,
    especially ones including Cyrillic. I can't think that many people would consider
    making one. You might be better off finding a proportionally spaced font that
    allows modifications and adjusting the widths yourself. Come tho think of it,
    why do you need monospaced?

    that (probably) has the language support you need. \r\nF "
