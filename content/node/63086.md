  were surprised that this feature existed, so I thought maybe others were unaware
  of its existence.\r\n\r\nWhile viewing a glyph string in the metrics window, on
  a Mac, shift command P will unfill the glyph shapes and render them in their outline
  form. Very helpful if you are spacing a connecting script. Shift command N will
  give reveal the control nodes as well.\r\n\r\nJust thought this might be of interest.
  If it is old news my apologies for wasting your time.\r\n\r\nJames\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/outline_metrics_5124.jpg]"

    such thing exist in the code, but it is not accessible from UI. It was done as
    an experiment, but I realized that it will require too much changes in internal
    data structures and UI, so we decided to leave it for next versions (where GW
    and MW will certainly be integrated)."
