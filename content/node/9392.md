  <BR>Or do you think it&#39;s custom lettering? <BR>Thanks!'

  body: It&#39;s a little hard to be positive with screen resolution being what it
    is, but it looks like a font. &#40;The O&#39;s and M&#39;s look identical to me&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>My first guess for a source would be Letterhead Fonts, but I&#39;ll start
    checking their collection, and get back to you unless someone else ID&#39;s it
    first.

  body: No luck at Letterhead, or Ingrimayne &#40;although some of these were not
    too far off&#41;.   <BR> <BR>There is a hand-made quality to the lettering, which
    is why I tried these two foundries. <BR> <BR>Other candidates might be Font-a-licious,
    Pizzadude or even Chank. I am done for the night, though. <BR> <BR>Good luck with
    this one.

  body: Hmmm, I think this is custom lettering, mainly because of the  <BR>amateuristic
    quality of the drawings and the inconsistencies  <BR>in the character shapes.
    <BR> <BR>The S, the tail of the R and the bowl of the D are quite clumsy, <BR>the
    weight distribution on the Ms is mirrored and the bottom  <BR>serifs on the W
    are really weird.

  body: How are you going to use it? Do you need a whole font that looks like that,
    or just the logo? If it&#39;s just the logo, you could trace it in Illustrator
    or Freehand.

  body: I need a font. I&#39;m creating a new logo and they want a similar font. I
    suppose I could just create my own custom lettering as well, but I&#39;m a little
    strapped for time. I just thought I&#39;d see what suggestions you guys had.

    target="_blank">nouveau</a>&#34; or some other term that might describe it at
    MyFonts. &#40;Tip: Put &#34;SUMMERWOOD&#34; in the sample text box.&#41; I&#39;m
    afraid it doesn&#39;t seem likely that this exists as a font.'

    bit of stroke to make it bolder.
