  No match on WhatTheFont and nothing in the IdentaFONT book either. Trying to match
  an existing book. I'm sure the author will accept Times Roman except that the lower
  case g is the deal breaker.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks so much, Janek. Now I\u2019m even more confused. Heh heh.\r\n\r\nThe
    \u201Cv\u201D is indeed a variant as well. The book was photoset in 1978. I doubt
    if the exact same font is available today digitally."
