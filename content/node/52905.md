  body: I'm eager to try it, but it crashed when importing my (admittedly very large)
    FontExplorer X library, and when importing a large folder of fonts.

    It's a great alternative for people currently using Font Book. \r\nBut professional
    designers should look out for the new Fontexplorer released in January. "

    font server. Unless it\u2019s just a very simple server, which makes sense now
    that I think about it. I was thinking more of urban coffee shops full of designers
    swapping fonts around the way one can with iTunes sharing. "

  body: What makes Fontcase interesting is how you are able to link info on Foundries,
    sort them by designer, genre, or even see the pdf specimen, and it also differentiates
    the font from each other when set in the typeface's actual typeface and not Lucida
    Grande which FontExplorer does at the moment. Excited to see what Linotype has
    got up their sleeve!

    that you can tell me, but you'd have to then kill me?

    background the only way to preview fonts?

    is very good alternative to Fontcase. It is the ultimate font utility for users
    who require a quick, easy and comprehensive overview of all their fonts on Mac.
