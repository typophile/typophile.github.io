body: 'i was thinking today... you know you see those catchword fonts sometimes that
  have logotypes like &#34;the,&#34; &#34;for,&#34; &#34;of the,&#34; &#34;and,&#34;
  etc. I was thinking i would like to come up with some kind of list that lists some
  of the most common. I&#39;d like this list to be multi-lingual, too, including any
  language that uses the latin alphabet and actually has catch words &#40;articles
  and prepositions mostly i guess&#41;. Anyhow, looking at LettError&#39;s Salmiak
  &#40;and racking my own brain&#41; i got: <BR> <BR><b>English</b> <BR>and, the,
  of, at, RSVP, etc., www., com, dot, inc., ltd., of the, for <BR> <BR><b>Spanish</b>
  <BR>el, la, de, del, de la, por, para, por el, por la, al, a la <BR> <BR>so there&#39;s
  a bit of a start. if anyone could help compiling this list &#40;or correcting my
  Spanish&#41; please tell me your catchwords. thnx for looking. <BR>'

  body: Paul, recruit linguistics. <BR>At the far right of this page <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/s_quality.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/s_quality.html</a> <BR>is a list
    of the 100 most frequent words in English. <BR> <BR>Not all of those are useful
    for the type of &#34;emphasis&#34; you&#39;re talking about, but if you don&#39;t
    get enough out of that list, try to work through lists like the Kucera &amp; Francis
    compilation. Many other languages are also well analyzed linguistically, but for
    those that are not, where there&#39;s a will, there&#39;s a way... <BR> <BR>hhp

    <BR>Any how these resources give me a good starting point, but i&#39;m wondering
    if I I could compile &#40;with some help hopefully&#41; a more comprehensive list.
    It looks like the FF catchword fonts cover some English, Spanish, French &amp;
    German. maybe there&#39;s some Italian in there too? I can&#39;t tell. I&#39;d
    like to go a bit broader if I could. <BR> <BR>maybe i would have made myself more
    clear if i had just said &#34;<a href="http://www.fonts.com/fontent/fontent_home.asp?nCo=AFMT&amp;con=fyti_logotypes"
    target="_blank"> logotypes</a>&#34; instead of &#34;catchwords.&#34;'
