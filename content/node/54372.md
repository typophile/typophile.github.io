  body: "Hi, Siaron,\r\n\r\nI read the info about your book on the <strong>mbp</strong>
    site... Sounds like an interesting project! Did it begin as a student thesis?
    I ask because some other recent design books had their genesis in student theses.
    Off the top of my head, I can think of <a href=\"http://www.markbattypublisher.com/servlet/book_view?number=40\"><em>Mexican
    Blackletter</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.parallelstrokes.com/\"><em>Parallel
    Strokes</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.fraktur-mon-amour.de/en/\"><em>Fraktur,
    Mon Amour</em></a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Ten-Commandments-Typography-Type-Heresy/dp/1858943558/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1233809292&sr=1-1\"><em>The
    Ten Commandments of Typography/Type Heresy</em></a> (and I'm sure there are others).\r\n\r\nSee
    also the <em>Mexican Blackletter</em> thread, here on Typophile:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/17496\r\n\r\nI
    agree with Yehan's comment... Are you allowed to post some spreads? :-)"
