    Bold]] for "FREMANTLE" (having no idea until seeing their website) and a custom
    job on [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection|United Serif (Semi Extended)]]
    (Bold). There''s also [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/stadium/|Stadium]]
    which not so far but, I guess, would need more time to customize. '
