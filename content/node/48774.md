  nothing to work off of- no existing designs or ideas of what they do or don't like.
  Their clientele remains fairly ambiguous as well. I'm flying blind. \r\n\r\nI came
  up with a ligature for a lettermark based on the lowercase j and m from ITC Modern
  No. 20. I really like the flow from the descender in the j up into the loops of
  the m. \r\n\r\nI'm unsure how I like Modern No. 20 for his name though, in the combination
  logo. \r\n\r\nOpinions?"

    style cues. It's impossible to design an effective logo unless you know the target
    market.

    play around with that idea tomorrow, thanks.\r\n\r\n<strong>jayyy:</strong> I'm
    now afraid you might be right, although I hadn't noticed that myself. I read your
    post from my iPhone while having a few beers with friends. I held it up and asked
    three people \"what two letters are these?\" Two said \"jm\", one said \"jn\".\r\n\r\n<strong>EileenB:</strong>
    Oh - I have. There's a lot of sans and scripts out there. I'd like to set Jason
    apart a little. When I said that \"I'm flying blind\" in my first post, I meant
    that I couldn't get much information from my client regarding their specific target
    market. \r\n\r\nThanks for everyone's input - and any more is of course eagerly
    welcomed. I will post revisions here, when I make them. "

  body: 'This is progressing nicely. A few tweaks: The loop from the "m" is at too
    sharp an angle, it should have a smoother flow. Go back and look at Weeman''s
    and bobbybobo''s samples. I prefer your second posting (2:32pm) perhaps it''s
    my monitor but on the earlier version the type is breaking apart. Are there any
    quality problems when you actually print the file?  Also the tighter kern works
    better for me with the "jm" ligature.  Have you tried aligning the baseline of
    "markesteyn" to the baseline of the "m"?  the name seems to be just floating there.'

  body: "You've got some kerning issues with both the ligature and the name. \r\n\r\nThe
    space within the ligature should be tighter. That might also solve the \"jim\"
    problem.\r\n\r\nThe kerning within the name is not balanced at all. You need to
    go through and even the spaces between letters. For example, the \"j\" and \"n\"
    in jason are too far from the \"aso\". And the \"r\" in markesteyn is too far
    from the \"k\". I'm also wondering what this would look like with a sans-serif
    font for the name. Might be worth a look.\r\n\r\nGood progress on this so far.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "I still don't like the arc. I'd move the top of the arc even more to the
    right and also not ending it at perfect vertical angle with \"m\". I'd make it
    go a bit to the right and then ending on top of \"m\". But not too much to still
    make it look visually right from the top of \"m\". Check the \"item\" where the
    ligature arc also goes a bit more to the right as expected, but visually it looks
    perfectly round and nice.\r\n\r\nThe wrong arc also makes the left stem of the
    \"m\" much higher then the rest of the letter so it becomes unbalanced.\r\n\r\nOtherwise:
    very nice job and interesting ligature.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

    possibly with engraving roots, such as AT Sackers Gothic, Blair, etc.\r\nWith
    the mark being quite decorative, the name doesn't need to fight for attention.
    \r\nSet in Modern 20 the serifs in the name may also suffer when reduced to a
    small size, or when foilstamped on a jewelry box etc. \r\nGood luck!"

    - I concur. I updated it on a different vector, but I'm migrating to a new computer
    right now and don't have Illustrator installed to do a \"Save As\" of the updated
