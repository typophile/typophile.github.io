  deal on a decent low-end laser printer, this is it: Office Depot is offering $20
  off the $200 HP 1022 (not to be confused with the bare-bottom 1020) which is a speedy
  true-1200dpi model with a very small footprint. And Staples has a $25-off coupon
  for any HP printer $200 or higher. The trick is to get the manager of your local
  Office Depot to agree to honor the Staples coupon, <cite>then</cite> take the 1022
  to the register... It's a great little printer, a steal at $155.\r\n\r\nNote that
  the Office Depot $20 off might be expiring today.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
