body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nHere is a typeface i'm working on. I'm very new to this, so
  any tips would be great!\r\n\r\nThe intention for this face was to create some using
  a 6-square grid (2 columns of 3 squares) to create each chatacter, also i was thinking
  of making it mono-space, but seeing it in action makes me think that is not a good
  idea...\r\n\r\nI'm doing this mostly to start learning the art and craft of type
  design, but i do intend on using it in designs to see how it holds up.\r\n\r\nThanks
  heaps!"

  body: The M gets iffy in the bold weight. I'd fudge the top end of the center stroke
    for better negative space. Or just connect it.

    really working, in my opinion."
