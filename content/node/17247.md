body: For those who would know the intimate details, I opened a PS Type 1 font in
  DTL Datamster Light, converted it to Ikarus format and did an outline cleanup with
  ContourMaster Light. I then attempted to open the same .ik file in FontLab 5, and
  it was da bomb...literally.

  body: "I believe that FontLab Studio 5 can open native VFB format files, as well
    as \"compiled\" fonts in TrueType and PostScript Type 1 format. (And possibly
    also PostScript Type 3.) Also, it will open variants of those formats, such as
    dfont and OpenType.\r\n\r\nOther software's native format files are not supported:
    Fontographer's fog format cannot be parsed by FontLab Studio 5, but FontLab's
    \"FogLamp\" utility can convert fogs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Yuri or Adam is around and
    can post a better-informed answer."

  body: I have openned them with FLS5 Windows. The encoding got completely lost, and
    the outlines had to be rescaled to 1000 square units, but really OK, all in all.

  body: FL5 Win...Dan, were the files you opened generated by DTL software, or did
    they come from elsewhere?

      your particular file you may send it to yar [at] fontlab [dot] com to let him
      look at it.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAlex Petrov"
