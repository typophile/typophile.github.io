body: "I'm working on some lettering Hawaiian words using the [[Okina]] character.
  I've read a few things online about it and the consensus is that it's the same character
  as the opening single quote. I can't help but think that it's just the way people
  are using it now and that there's a more traditional unique character out there.
  This article on Wikipedia doesn't make it any easier for me: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okina
  (probably because I never learned to read). \r\n\r\nSo to simplify my question:
  Is there a more traditional and correct character that is not the opening single
  quote to represent the Okina character? Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    grammar from 1864</a> uses a simple apostrophe (a closing single quote as opposed
    to the opening single quote) to indicate the 'guttural break'.\r\n\r\nIf you look
    closely at the table in the Wikipedia article, it says that the okina for Hawaiian
    is 'transitionally formalised', while for Tongan it is 'officially formalised'.
    That means presumably that for Hawaiian at least, the glottal stop was indicated
    in a number of ways (apostrophe as in the grammar, or completely omitted as in
    the dictionary), but it has transitioned to using the present form of the okina.
    I doubt there was a traditional unique character; they probably used the apostrophe
    or single quote forms from the start.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could try searching Google
    Books for examples of literature for other Polynesian languages that use the okina
    such as Tongan and Tahitian. It would be interesting to learn when the okina and
    its form was standardized for these languages."
