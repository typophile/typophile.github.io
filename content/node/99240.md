  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fahr1_5874.jpg]This is gonna give Hrant
    a lotta \"cause\"'... but anyway.\r\n\r\nThis is a close approximation I think.
    It's called \"Barney\" from Bright Ideas which apparently used to be a magazine
    in Carlsbad CA which apparently went out of business and left no forwarding address.
    They apparently issued some 500 fonts over time* .\r\n\r\nWhat is the status of
    abandonware? Is that such a term? Does it mean anything here?\r\n\r\nWhile Dafont
    has a group of Bright Ideas designs(!), there is no apparent supplier for this
    specific font. I can't recommend its use but am curious.\r\n\r\n*[[http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-25927.htmll]]"

  body: ^ That's similar but the e, y, h, t are very different. It's not an exact
    match to any of the characters.
