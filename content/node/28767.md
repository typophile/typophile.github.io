  body: I've seen similar things in Photoshop done by using filters and then converting
    the colour image to line art, but I don't remember the process in detail.  Play
    around with a few pix....

  body: Your best bet is to hire an illustrator that works in that style. If that's
    not in the budget I think this <A HREF="http://www.andromeda.com/main/cutline.php">Cutline
    Plug-In</A> from Andromeda is better than Flaming Pear's.

  body: "Try taking your photo. Adjust the contrast to simplify the image. Size the
    image. Convert to grayscale. Upsample to 1200 dpi. Convert to bitmap> halftone>
    line> now work with the line number and angle to get the effect you want.\r\n\r\nNote:
    this will not produce the wavy contour lines that must be done by hand, but it
    will give a similar effect. The end result will be an 1-bit tiff that will print
    with clean lines. Some experimentation is needed to get the best reults."

  body: 'I don''t think it''s possible unless you construct a 3D model/template, because
    the lines are mapped to volumetric surfaces. It also requires discretionary "directioning"
    of the lines. '

  body: "David: of course, anything is possible with Photoshop :-)\r\nBut note how
    in the Richler illustration the lines for the hair look like hair, and on the
    skin follow the form of his face, whereas in the \"Engraver\" filter example,
    the wavy pattern bears only occasional coincidence with the represented form.
    Where the pseudo-engraving goes across the eye for instance, a real illustrator
    would have drawn a line along the eyelid, and a circle for the iris. To improve
    the effect in Photoshop, it would be better to combine using the engraving filter
    on flat areas, but use Levels for high contrast in areas with linear detail. "
