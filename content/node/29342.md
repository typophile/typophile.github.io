body: "For years now I've been a fan of a certain type designer's hand lettering,
  of which I have a small gathering of samples. Recently I designed a broadsheet using
  letters drawn from scans of these samples by tracing each individual letter and
  placing each vector outline into position, one at a time, in Illustrator. However,
  after years of making small adjustments to fonts, I've finally decided to try my
  hand at developing one, and am planning to do so based on the above mentioned hand
  lettered samples.\r\n\r\nMy plan is 2-fold:\r\n\r\n<ol><li>To scan and trace the
  hand-lettering samples in rough form (that is, \"keeping\" the rough edge of the
  calligraphic letterforms) and develop an OpenType version with various ligatures
  & auto-replacements. Additional glyphs would have to be created from scratch for
  missing letters, analphabetics, numerals, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Use the same scans again,
  but this time draw each letterform from scratch to create a smooth version of each.
  Again, additional glyphs would need to be created for missing letters, analphabetics,
  numerals, etc.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nThe two would be called something like \"DesignerNameHandLettered
  - Rough\" and \"DesignerNameHandLettered - Smooth.\" These are only throw-away name
  suggestions, but they may come into play in my queries below.\r\n\r\nTo begin with
  these would simply be an experiment for myself, to go through the process and see
  what I can put together. However, if they result in something useful, there might
  be the possibility of releasing them into the world.\r\n\r\nSo, my questions:\r\n\r\nWhat
  are the ethical/legal implications of developing the \"rough\" version, which would
  be more or less directly traced from the samples I have, along with the additional
  glyphs I would make to fill in the gaps.\r\n\r\nWhat are the ethical/legal implications
  of developing the \"smooth\" version, which would be all original outlines, loosely
  based on the samples, along with the additional glyphs I would make to fill in the
  gaps.\r\n\r\nAssuming that such endeavours are ethically/legally doable, what sort
  of naming protocol might I employ? That is, my \"Rough\" and \"Smooth\" name variations
  are awful, so I'm looking for some general input on this front.\r\n\r\nI've refrained
  from mentioning the designer by name as I'd like to deal with the general implications
  of such a project first. (For example, including the designer's name in the font
  names may pose an issue, but I'll address that down the road...)\r\n\r\nAny and
  all advise would be appreciated..."

    in fact, encouraged (by way of how-to books\u2014others to copy their work, so
    there are no ethical problems, especially since you state your intention to credit
    the original designer. Legal implications are another matter: if \"DesignerName\"
    is still living, or if his/her heirs administer an estate, or if another foundry
    has trademarked the name, then you may have problems (in the last instance, if
    a certain foundry has trademarked the name, you WILL have problems)."

  body: "Legally, you're probably okay if you don't use the designers name to promote
    either font. Ethically, I'm with Tiffany, you need permission from the designer
    even if you don't use their name and regardless of how much you modify or regularize
    the scans.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative produce the font and write a letter to the
    type designer using the font. Ask mundane questions about his/her inspiration
    from Latvian carved folk art inscriptions. If they reply without mentioning the
    font - you're in the clear! "

  body: "If you do this project with the firm, final conviction that you will never
    try to release it for sale or distribution, I see it as a valuable way for you
    to learn a lot of useful things about type design. I think the different treatments/interpretations
    could be interesting. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are definitely ethical problems doing
    this for future sale. For one, if the type designer is alive, have you considered
    asking them if you could digitize their handwriting, for any purpose? If this
    person is a type designer, I would be very hesitant to even propose making type
    from their handwriting unless you had entered an agreement with them that you
    would allow them to approve or edit what you produce. How could you be sure they
    are not planning to do their own handwriting face?  Why choose the handwriting
    of a type designer and not a musician, parent, or other person who has no involvement
    in type design? This makes your situation more delicate. \r\n\r\nThe best approach
    is to ask the type designer about it and see what they would agree to. I suspect
    the designer would want to be involved with any typeface made from his/her handwriting.
    Contact the designer. Do not expect to release such a design without their involvement. "

    ethical right to release, you are obviously a fan of the work, and should make
    it for yourself. Additionally, OpenType is a fascinating tool for communicating
    that that we've barely begun to dig into. \r\n\r\nAs far as names, I wouldn't
    use a \"BlahBlahHandLettered\" + \"rough\" and \"smooth\". It isn't exactly hand
    lettered, once you redesign it as a smooth crisp face. Perhaps \"Blah Blah\" and
    \"Blah Blah Hand\", instead? Even better, perhaps instead of using the designer's
    name,\"Blah Blah\" could be a word association from an aspect of their life, philosophy
    or influence on you? That idea is again, totally separate from any legal reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<A

  body: "Thanks for the feedback so far, much of which is what I expected, yet hoped
    against. Given the tendency of designers & foundries to issue multiple versions
    of classic faces (Garamond, Bembo, etc.), even utlizing the name of the original
    designer (and in such cases we're talking about designers who actually made the
    type [for print]), I had my fingers crossed for a unanymous green light. Of course,
    those faces are hundreds of years old and thus public domain, and, really, I'm
    not quite that foolish.\r\n\r\nTo add a bit of information, the designer in question
    is no longer alive (died last centry). The letterforms are not \"handwriting\"
    but carefully crafted caligraphic letterforms, in the shape of Roman capitals
    (some of you out there are probably getting close to figuring out who and what
    I'm talking about). I've also just discovered that the designer's surname is trademarked
    by the foundry that handles the designer's fonts (OK, now I'm sure there are a
    few who known who I'm talking about.)\r\n\r\nThere are a handful of fonts commercially
    available by this designer, but all of these were designed as type for print,
    as opposed to hand-drawn letterforms meant as calligraphy.\r\n\r\nSo, for the
    moment I'd like to see where this thread goes, to see if others might have different
    perspectives, or, better yet, first-hand experience with such a project. Once
    things flesh out a bit more here it looks like my next task will be contacting
    the designer's estate and or trademark-owner, which will likely, I'm afraid, squash
    the idea completely.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I really don't know, but if it is someone who died 50 or more years ago,
    my hunch is that it would be OK legally and morally. For example, Christian Schwartz,
    Dennis Pasternak and George Ryan have all done typefaces based on the same piece
    of lettering by Oswald Cooper, who died in 1940. And the later two are even with
    the same foundry! As you will see, they are all different: \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Fritz\">Fritz</a>

    guess is that you will find that the distance between 'rough' and \r\n'smooth'
    is way farther than one might think--as the diversity of these examples shows. "

  body: i had an idea. i'm not sure how many type designer/calligraphers there are.
    if i'm thinking who you're thinking, i would guess you're pretty safe. Definately
    a style worth making a type from, and (if i have the designer right) there's actually
    quite a bit of stuff to use as reference. i have a bit of a letter written in
    his casual hand, which is just gorgeous.
