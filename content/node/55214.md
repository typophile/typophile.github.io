body: "Let me begin by saying that I am no pirate.  I am actually so vocal on the
  subject that I have on occasion bullied others.  So, it is with that said that I
  must voice my current predicament.  I truly hope that within that context, there
  is some sort of resolution.\r\n\r\nSometime in the spring of last year, I was taken
  with a beautiful font that frequented the ID forum on some book covers: ITC Didi.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
  (not to rehash the facts) Didi was digitized by Image Club Graphics in the late
  80's-early 90's, but was later discontinued.  So, I let my crush on the beautiful
  but unattainable Didi fade.  In the company of other type dorks, I would sometimes
  mention this star-crossed font, waxing poetic about what might have been. *le sigh*\r\n\r\nI
  was moving on in my life, still giddy with my recent purchase of Archer, when an
  acquaintance of mine brought up my old flame.  In fact, she emailed me the object
  of my desire; the actual file for Didi.  I have opened it, and studied the glyphs.
  \ However, I feel like this is somehow worse.  Before, it was simply out of reach.
  \ Now, it is within reach, but only on the \"dl\".\r\n\r\nHow could I possibly ever
  use this?  I am sure that the file in question was attained through dubious means.
  \ I would be willing to pay for the rights to actually use it, but how would I go
  about broaching that subject?  Is what I propose even possible?\r\n\r\nAs an ex
  smoker, I compare this to having a cigarette and no means by which to light it.\r\n\r\nShould
  I delete this file and forget I ever had it?   \r\n"

  body: If you have a problem with piracy but are okay with fibbing I'd send mail
    to Allan Haley saying that you've inherited a corporate identity project that
    uses the font. The previous designer (now serving time in Wormwood Scrubs for
    unrelated crimes) provided all the files, but as an upstanding citizen you'd like
    to know where to send the check to cover the license fee for the font.

  body: "So, let me get this straight.  It's <em>possible</em> to license a font that
    is discontinued, as long as you weave an elaborate tale?\r\n\r\nOr perhaps you
    were being sarcastic and I am merely overenthusiastic."

  body: Thank you for the response.  How should I ask?  I mean, I'm a bit hesitant
    to tell him that someone emailed it to me.  Should I fib a little?

  body: I hope you don't mind. I've taken the liberty to contact Allan for you. I
    think you'll be pleased with the result. I'll email you now.

  body: 'I was being a bit silly. But yes if you have the font file in your possession,
    and you want to pay for it most font vendors large or small would appreciate you
    wanting to do the right thing, and work out something for you if contractually
    they are able to. Elaborate tales as to how you got the font and how much you
    need it to do your job can''t hurt.  '
