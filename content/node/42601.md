  looks a little like Chaparral Sans</cite>.\"\r\n\r\nThat has me wondering, what
  other combinations of typefaces have you seen that seem to match, but probably never
  would have made the connection?\r\n\r\nFor me, it's the uncanny match of Univers
  and Utopia. When set at corresponding type sizes, they seem to be like brothers
  to me. (You think Slimbach had that in mind?)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This isn't surprising or odd, but given how both families were set up with
    display and text variants already, it's interesting: Kepler works as a display
    companion amazingly well with Utopia. If Kepler in text is too florid for you,
    use Utopia.\r\n\r\nI actually think Veronika Burian's Karmina works better as
    a companion to Meta than Meta Serif. Is that blasphemy?  ;)"

  body: Hah! Funny you should say that. I was just testing <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/typetogether/karmina_bundle/">Karmina
    on FontShop.com</a> this week and noticed some similarities to Meta Serif. They
    certainly have a similar structure. Karmina doesn't pair better with Meta if you
    really use them side by side in a layout, but I share your love for it. I set
    the text of [[Interrobang]] 5 in Karmina and found it a pleasure to use.
