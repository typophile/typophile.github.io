    body: "That has to be it, Lex. Knockout #46 Flyweight looks like a ringer. \r\n\r\nAnd
      yet... the \"S\" in the New York type sample curves in at the ends, which Knockout
      Flyweight doesn't appear to do. (Hard to tell because of the interface on Knockout's
      type preview page.)\r\n\r\nEvery time I visit this board, I am blown away, and
      this time is no exception!"
