body: I want to use a font with old-style proportions, old-style numerals, ff, ffi
  & ffl ligatures as well as fi and fl, and italics. I am editing an anthology of
  short stories on Microsoft Word, so suggestions should come in the form of either
  links to TrueType or OpenType free downloads, or versions of fonts on Word that
  you know possess all these features. So far, the only font that really fits the
  bill is Georgia, but I don't like its heavy proportions; they are less elegant than
  old style fonts.

      that I'd have to pay for, please tell, but I don't think there needs to be any
      derision over a want for not having to pay."

  body: "Sometimes people have a good reason to require a free font, but editing an
    anthology on Word doesn't seem like one. Also, some good commercial fonts cost
    less than one month of cellphone service, fancy shoes, etc. Just because free
    fonts exist doesn't create a requirement to never spend any money on fonts. Especially
    since you seem to be sensitive to typography, and you can't be exceptional with
    fonts that anybody can acquire with zero commitment.\r\n\r\nFirst place I'd look:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/features/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2013/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "To me, the main reason for wanting an open-source font would be to be able
    to use it on a web site.\r\n\r\nThere are fonts that are not free, but still very
    inexpensive, for printing things on a laser printer. Some word processing programs
    provided a large selection of fonts as one way to compete with Microsoft Word.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know offhand of a free Garamond. There are open-source imitations of Palatino
    for use with Linux for example - such as TeX Gyre Pagella.\r\n\r\nIf you look
    through Google Web Fonts, you should find a few old style ones. Unfortunately,
    one of the nicest, Goudy Bookletter 1911, has a coding problem that prevents it
    working properly with some older Windows programs, such as WordPad.\r\n\r\nAnother
    free old style font is Day Roman."

    body: Thank you; those are some very nice fonts. I get Garamond on Word but it
      doesn't have ff ligatures, which is why I am shunning it. I don't mind lining
      figures but would rather have non-lining, so it's only optional really. I just
      managed to swindle Adobe Caslon Pro by means of free trial, which I have always
      liked, although it doesn't have old style numerals.

    A lot of non-free typefaces do, such as the Bitstream faces, so the feature is
    not rare.\r\n\r\nOh, and by the way, this is not the forum in which to brag about
    your successes in font piracy. Most of the posters here are professional font
    designers, who would like to make a living from their work."

    body: " I'm sorry if the expression 'swindled' rubbed you the wrong way--it wasn't
      meant to be taken literally; what I did at Adobe was, to the best of my knowledge,
      legal.\r\n For me Day Roman had a multitude of fantastic ligatures in a separate
      font file. It didn't have italics though. But most likely I will be using Hightower,
      which is on word but without ff ligatures, so I'll probably buy the MyFonts
      version. I found that Hightower was quite similar to Goudy Bookletter, having
      more character than so-called invisible fonts."

  body: "I apologize for misunderstanding your reference to the use of a free trial;
    usually, a \"free trial\" means something is available for a limited period or
    under a restrictive license, and so it sounded as though you had a limited-time
    version of a font, and made a permanent copy.\r\n\r\nI should have known better
    than to imagine that such DRM for fonts exists, however.\r\n\r\nAnd I did forget
    that you could put the ligatures in manually with the companion Day Roman - Expert
    font."

  body: I may be wrong on this, and it might depend on your version of Word, but I
    have the uneasy feeling that Word will simply not implement ligatures, even for
    fonts that have them. I know that fonts that I know to have ligatures do not display
    them in Word 2013 for Windows, even though the ligatures are all present and correct
    in Indesign. Perhaps you should check with Microsoft?

  body: "The version of Word I have allows you to switch on \"all ligatures\", but
    not the standard ligatures only. That's an outdated version, though; it might
    be better in newer versions.\r\n\r\nPages does ligatures automatically, and it
    allows access to Apple's typography panel, which is great... but I find it maddening
    for other reasons. For instance, its hyphenation function sucks, and it doesn't
    recognize soft hyphens.\r\n\r\nUse LaTeX, maybe...?"
