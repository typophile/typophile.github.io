it's a good practice to observe if a theme was already discussed before you post a new topic. A question about one's favourite fonts is the kind of matter you will find in older topics – sometimes in a specific way, as "your favourite gothic sans" or "the best serif fonts for books".

So, firstly you may try to do a search using Google this way:
"what are your favourite fonts" site: typophile.com

The forum has its own search, but it's not working by now.

Another good practice is what I'm doing now: although we both speak Portuguese, I wrote in English to let other users read our discussion.</div>

I’m sorry you feel annoyed with me. Please don’t expect an immediate reply to ‘<a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/67516">an interesting and polemic question</a>’, sent on a Sunday night. Frankly, I’m not interested at all in getting involved in private discussions via e-mail about illegal font sharing. If you like to learn about/discuss font licensing and other typography-related topics, you are very welcome to do so on this forum. 

Here’s a link to <a href="http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=415112?lang=EN">Neo® Complete Family Pack (Sans & Tech) at Monotype</a>. Here’s <a href="http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=415088&/">Neo Sans Regular</a>. I’m sure you can find the Italic and Bold without my help.
Best regards and good luck with your exams,
Florian</div>

It's all OK.
Well, I understood you, I sent you a private message via e-mail because I was afraid of making those questions that I did to you because it would cause conflicts and fights among typographic designers and people interested in free download of good and best fonts and you would censure and cut my polemic questions as if Brazil in 1964, China, Iran and North Korea censured the journal and the reports. I'm very experienced with the forums and the forum moderators. I know very well the moderators of forums, communities of Facebook and Orkut. All forum and communities moderators are dictator like dictators Ahamadejah, Mao-Tse-Tung and Castello Branco, a Brazilian militar dictator of 1964 Coup d'État. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Neo Sans is not a free font, as you may have guessed from looking at sites that are selling it.

Why do you need this font? If you really need it, you should be able to get your client or sponsor to pay for it and get it legally. If you only need a font that has the same feel, I'm sure you will be able to find free fonts, or fonts that you already paid for and are bundled with other software, that are similar enough for your needs.

But if you are studying for university entrance examinations, I can't imagine why you would really need this font. Don't you mean you just really want the font? There is a difference between needing and wanting.

<cite>If I buy and download only Neo Sans Regular, is it possible that I italicise and bold this font?</cite>

Some software will produce mechanical obliques (false italics) and bolds from the regular, but this creates visual distortions and is not considered professional.</div>

<em><strong>Why do you need this font? If you really need it, you should be able to get your client or sponsor to pay for it and get it legally.

I need this font for my blog, letters, articles and MSN so it pleases a lot my sight. 

<em><strongou should be able to get your client or sponsor to pay for it and get it legally</em></strong>

Wow, how do I do?

<em><strong>But if you are studying for university entrance examinations, I can't imagine why you would really need this font. Don't you mean you just really want the font? There is a difference between needing and wanting.</em></strong>

I want and need at the same time.

This font isn't for university entrance examinations. When I'll be classified or approved in the list, if I'll have some homework or university or carsity works, I want to maintain this font for pleasing the teachers's sight in order that they give me the good notes. 

Brian, thank you for your informations about the italicization and the bold of one font. I'll buy four styles of a font. 
_______

I've just searched for this font at Linotype.com The group of 4 styles of a font costs 236 euros (544 Brazilian reais). Oh my God! Each month I have to buy each one font which costs 59 euros (144 Brazilian reais). Really very expensive. </div>

Nice things cost money.

Tell you what. Take a break from convincing us that you deserve a free font family, and try to create one yourself. I guarantee that after taking the time to sketch, revise, digitize, revise again, test, revise some more (repeat as needed), and perfect four weights in a full-character set of Romans, you'll understand why pro fonts are "really very expensive."

Complete this task, share screenshots of your work, tell us your experience during the  process, and then we can discuss this issue further.

Best of luck.</div>

The font gusrejc1989 is looking for is : Neo Sans Unicase.

Hi Gustavo,

Thanks for the kind words.
The unicase version won't be available for a while, probably,

Gustavo - you're new here and haven't yet developed an established relationship with the community here. When you posted a message that asks for a commercially-sold font *for free* - well that's not only bad manners, it's unethical and also, in many cases, illegal. To top off this mistake, you made such a request here on a forum that's frequented and used by people who make a living designing and producing such creations - including Seb. Thus you are receiving "pushback".

So the lessons to learn are: Don't offend the community you're visiting, don't ask people to do something illegal, and finally, save up the money if you want it.</div>

You were not suspected of being a little mythological being (troll) but a certain kind of provoker of debate or 'flames' (see: http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/t/troll.html).

Take your time and relax. Come back in a couple of days and learn from people who is not either xenophobic nor aggressive.  </div>

The ugly font you are searching for can be found via Google! I don’t think, that it is immorally, if a kid uses an unlicensed font, as far, as it does not make money with the work, for which it uses the font, as far as it does not have much money and as far as it does not become attuned to use commercial software without paying for it. A font is not a car!

By the way, I am German, too. With regard to the speed of downsizing democracy, our constitution and civil rights, and with regard to upsizing our surveillance infrastructure we are actually in the mid-table of the Western European league. But at least we don’t have paramilitary units here, that shoot street kids to death. The scissors of poor and rich is much more open in Brazil. You don’t seem to know much about Germany. (Maybe your prejudices are valid in fifteen or twenty years.)</div>

You need to tame yourself. When someone disagrees with you, he/she is not against you. People here did answer your messages with education even after your attacked them with unfair accusations. They even considered you're very a young boy who may confuse some words as English is not your native language. You may learn from them how to be polite and tries to understand other's point of view.

You will surely live many other situations where people will say 'no' to your interests. It's necessary to manage this and to understand this 'no'. This time all you need is to leave the forum. But the real life is not so simple.

For me, as a Brazilian, it's a shame to read these attacks you made, talking about dictatorships and Germans. Hope you do some reflection about this episode and ask yourself why everybody became 'against' you.

You may ask moderators to remove your accounts – I think you have more than one. Take a look at http://www.typophile.com/readme</div>
