  its a big fat geometric face with the edges cut off at 45 degrees, its usually on
  a background that looks like graph paper. i cant find any samples of it online.
  ive just always been curious, nothing important. '

  body: ' a few of his fonts looked pretty close but from what i remember about the
    font i saw, his are a little less &#34;structured&#34;. his work is badass though,
    i love his retro/punk/comicbook style. his characters are simple but theyre great. '
