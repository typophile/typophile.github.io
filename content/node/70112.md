  compact, 24*34cm, 9.4\"*13\" \u2013 for a not for profit organization. The association
  is devoted to the promotion of its territory: from conscious tourism to the preservation
  and valorisation of their local artistic and environmental heritage.\r\n\r\nBeing
  an organization funded by its own members, I have been asked to use only free or
  cheap typefaces.\r\n\r\nI think I need a good sans serif, with a regular and condensed
  family, and a serif for body text. I'd like to have some personality on the pages,
  starting from typography, but I understand their budget issues.\r\n\r\nHave you
  got any idea to spare with me? Thank you very much."

    \r\n\r\nIf the purpose of the publication is to raise money it might be worth
    doing a cost/benefit analysis of professionally producing the publication, vs
    saving a few $'s by scouring DaFont for hours on end.\r\n\r\nCheers, si\r\n"

    may seem trite, but they are generally first-rate products and are included in
    the cost of the layout program.

    make it a point to support, and work with, a local type designer. Rather than
    skimp on the formal side of the production, make it a meta-statement on what you're
    trying to achieve\u2026 let the client lead by good example."

  body: "Exactly, Jabez. I will work pro bono too.\r\n\r\nThey are nice people, no
    more than a private committee, doing things for free like organising small fairs
    with local vegetables producers and photographers, lobbying the local authorities
    for the establishment of a county museum, inventing things to do in the countryside
    with kids and parents as an alternative to the malls of the nearby big city. I
    do not even think they are a registered NGO. Actually, I'd bet they are not.\r\n\r\nThe
    newspaper will hardly work to raise funds, Si. As they are really a \"bunch of
    hippies\" \u2013 I use the term in an affectionate, warm way \u2013 their main
    goal is to spread the word: more a newsletter in a newspaper shape than a newspaper
    in itself, as in Italy you need a registered journalist as editor and a tribunal
    authorization to publish any single thing. So much for the freedom of press and
    expression.\r\nHowever, their events that I attended to were completely free:
    I suspect they haven't even had the idea to ask for money. Anyone was bringing
    own food and beverages et voil\xE0, kids were playing, people singing or staring
    at the photographs on the medieval walls of the villages, picking small cubes
    of chees offered by local farmers. Yes, the more I talk about them, the more I
    like them \u2013 naivet\xE9 comprised.\r\n\r\nOld Nick, I work with Quark XPress
    7.\r\n\r\nNina, yours is truly a great idea. I will pass onto them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo
    far, thanks to each of you for the time spent."

  body: "There are some good Open Source typefaces you could have a look at: Gentium,
    Linux Libertine, Liberation. Bundled fonts are certainly a good place to start
    as well.\r\n\r\nI personally like [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Canada_Type/|Canada
    Type]], an independent foundry which sells nice and original fonts for a reasonable
    price. You could also have a look at some fonts by [[http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/stonetypefoundry.html|Stone
    Type Foundry]], especially Silica, StonePrint or ITC Stone.\r\n\r\nSome other
    good quality freefonts are PT Sans, Aller and League Gothic (all available at
    fontsquirrel.com)\r\n\r\nHope this helps "
