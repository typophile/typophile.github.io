  I am in the process of designing an exhibit on how music effects the memory. I was
  wondering if anybody had some ideas of what font would be the best for displaying
  information in an exhibit style of environment?

    size yet?

  body: The exhibit size is fairly big. It is about 20 ft x 20 ft. Most of the posters
    that I will be putting up will be read from about 5-10 ft. away.
