    Lights</a>, and it&#39;s free. For my money, however, I like Letraset&#39;s <a
    href="http://www.letraset.com/us/template1a.asp?catid=60&amp;id=341">Chromium
    1</a> better.

  body: Quicksilver is the original Letraset name for it. Chromium One is a different
    Letraset font along similar lines.

  body: It also appears that Letraset&#39;s Quicksilver is only available in the form
    of crummy unauthorized free fonts.

    of it here:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=22838\r\n\r\nSo
    I've dug up this old thread to share it with you.\r\n\r\nP.S. Once upon a time
    Bitstream had digitized it -- also, OPTIFONTS had it."
