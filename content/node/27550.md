body: I am trying to move words in my paragraph (such as of at the end of a sentence)
  to the next line, but when i do a hard return or even keep hitting the space bar,
  my paragraph is no longer justified, instead it makes a huge indent.  Does anyone
  know how to fix this? It is driving me crazy
