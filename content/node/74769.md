  body: "I'm with Christopher; the documentary showcases the incredible artistry and
    flexibility of the Mayan script. If you're in the U.S., you can watch it on Hulu:

    Ross in the MATD program at Reading designed <a href=http://www.typefacedesign.org/resources/A5specimen/2010/SteveRoss_Yukatek_specimen.pdf>Yukatek</a>
    for transcription of Maya with the Latin alphabet. It has a few original Mayan
    glyphs rounding out the character set."
