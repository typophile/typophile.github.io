body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm a music artist/DJ (electronic dance music) and I'm trying
  to create a unique type-based logo to be used on flyers/website/album covers etc.
  I only started learning Illustrator a few weeks ago so I'm pretty much a rookie.
  This is one idea I managed to come up with:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/phynnlogo.gif\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see it's quite plain, and doesn't really stand out in terms of originality
  from other logos in the dance music business. \r\n\r\nAny tips or ideas from more
  advanced designers would be a great help!"

  body: For example, any advice on how to improve the font, or a good idea for a different
    background shape. I'm just looking for some additional ideas from experienced
    designers to improve what I have so far :)

  body: "Look at the angles that are cut out of the edges of the letterforms, I personally
    would reflect the relationship of those forms in the background shape.  also,
    is it 'phynn' and if it is, is there a specific reason there are two different
    'n' letterforms used right next to eachother?\r\n\r\n- Scott Sullivan\r\nwww.trifepdgm.com"
