  match, but wondering what type of treatment/face may give this look/impression?
  I also realize that this is probably a machine specific font for industrial use,
  but anyone come across a similar sort of utilitarian font (face stamped in the back
  of the watch) Cheers,\r\nm[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WHATFONT_5342.png]"
