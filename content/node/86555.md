  body: If this is a problem in one glyph then manually select the paths, copy them,
    nuke the glyph, create it again, and paste the paths in. If this is happening
    consistently, restart Fontlab. If restarting Fontlab does not fix this then your
    Fontlab installation may have been corrupted somehow and you should reinstall.
