body: 'This is Bitmuni, based on San Francisco MUNI train windows. I&#39;ve seen this
  font done in vector form, but I&#39;ve not seen it in 2-color bitmap, hence my version:

  <BR> <BR>Would love to hear your thoughts. Certainly the original designer of the
  letter template had to work to get all the letters of the alphabet to work within
  the constraints. Is this the best solution? I wonder if we at Typophile could come
  up with a better &#34;binary&#34; way of displaying the alphabet... Anyone want
  to take a crack at it? <BR>'

  body: Mono fonts like that one you look at the train  are very usefull for signage,
    Jared.  <BR> <BR>I dont try to be inoportune, but I have done 2 similar binary
    pixel fonts, looks very similar in the way that you show us, from the same vector
    based modern mono typography ones i guess. <BR> <BR>Mine is unnamed, i just put
    it here to compare with your cool Bitmuni, i guess that lc dont look good, perhaps
    need a new solution. <BR> <BR>Crack it. <BR> <BR>MH <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15253.gif"
