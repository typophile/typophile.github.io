  of Garamond. I have [[Garamond]], Garamond Premier Pro, and Adobe Garamond Pro.\r\n\r\nBeing
  rather new to the world of typography I was wondering what the difference(s) between
  them was. So I put the three styles next to each other and I noticed some differences
  in stroke weight, stress, density and so on but I figured I would see if there was
  anyone on here that could explain to me what is so different about the three.\r\nPerhaps
  its a stupid question."

  body: There are literally scores of different digitizations and renditions of Garamond's
    original metal typefaces. I am not sure which foundry's is your "Garamond" (you
    might find out by looking at its info in FontExplorer X) but Adobe Garamond and
    Garamond Premier have very distinct differences which you can learn about at [[Adobe]]'s
    website.

  body: Ahh, thank you much, It was really the difference between Adobe Garamond pro
    and Garamond Premier Pro that I was wondering about. The Garamond I have had some
    very clear differences from the other two but adobe and Premier are quite similar.

    </cite>\r\n\r\nI've dubbed that phenomena a sipeservation. It's the same concept
    like when you start looking for a new car and then ultimately buy one, almost
    immediately after the purchase you see your \"new\" car everywhere. It's almost
    like everyone owns it. Really, it's the moment you become aware of something you
    weren't really aware of until you started focusing on it. I didn't know what that
    was called, so I came up with my own word for it."

  body: Since the second two are Adobe I will assume you are referring to Adobe versions.
    There might be some slight differences contour shapes between the early Adobe
    versions and the Pro and Premium versions. The main difference is the number of
    extras that the newer versions contain. Premium was included with the CS3 version
    of creative suite and has a very large number of glyphs including a lot of ornaments.
    The Pro version is a bit smaller than the Premium and that is what now ships with
    CS4.

    in the OP are Garamond Premier Pro and Adobe Garamond Pro. Adobe Garamond was
    one of the first Adobe Originals, designed by Robert Slimbach and released in
    1989. It was later converted to OpenType and renamed Adobe Garamond Pro.\r\n\r\nGaramond
    Premier Pro is a completely separate Garamond revival, also by Robert Slimbach.
    It is less regularized (Adobe Garamond had to be designed to accommodate less
    powerful software and hardware of its day) and has four optical sizes. Garamond
    Premier Pro also has Greek and Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nThere is no \"Premium\" version.
    They both support CE languages, so they both have the \"Pro\" suffix."
