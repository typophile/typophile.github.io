  body: I prefer Akzidenz personally, but I can see arguments for using either in
    different cases. They do have very distinct personalities. I don't see them as
    interchangeable.

  body: "Some people like rough stones, some the ones that have been rounded of by
    eons in a riverstream. Same with AG (rough and full of character) and Helvetica
    (streamlined, everybody\u2019s best friend). \r\n\r\nI know which one I prefer.
    And I also like the modern takes that keep the character and raise the usability,
    like National and Founders Grotesk."

  body: "Personally, I prefer Helvetica to both Helvetica Neue and to Akzidenz Grotesk
    (Standard). Maybe that just shows that I lack taste.\r\n\r\nBut that's a general
    preference, and there are times when the other two typefaces have their place,
    depending on what mood one wishes to create."

  body: Do the Capitals of Akzidens Grotesk have a heavier relative weight to the
    lowercase characters compared with others? I read a book set in AG and after a
    while the Capitals starting sentences started to stick out to me. Or is that something
    common with all of it's relatives?

  body: "Helvetica stands out for being very clean and tidy without being severe.
    A somewhat rare and likeable combination.\r\nVery regular spacing, the characters
    tend to end in a neat horizontal line instead of emphasising the shapes, curves
    flow neatly into straights.\r\n\r\nHowever, I find Helvetica a surprisingly poor
    text face - much worse than most that look almost identical at first glance. The
    same regularity coupled with a large x-height makes it tiring to read because
    there is little to guide the eye.\r\nAkzidenz Grotesk fares much, much better.\r\n\r\nStressed
    capitals:\r\nI found these helpful if the author uses long sentences in a language
    without gratuitous capitalisation: names and starts of sentences are things that
    the reader may want to find quickly.\r\nThey break the flow and become seriously
    annoying if there is too much capitalisation though; German set in typefaces with
    shouty capitals is a pet peeve."
