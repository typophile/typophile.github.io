  you had to pair Horatio with some other typeface, what would you use?\r\nSans, serif,
  script - I'm open to any suggestions.\r\n\r\nI have a logo set in Horatio, and need
  to set a slogan under it but I haven't\r\nfound any typeface that I think goes well
  with Horatio.\r\nThe first thought was a geometric slab serif, but again, the results
  have\r\nbeen quite dissapointing.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n"

    all uppercase, lowercase or mixed? Is there a mark?\r\n\r\nI would guess that
    a face that suited a logo containing that C, G, O or Q might be different from
    one that didn't.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "The logo is lowercase and it's for a companyt that manufactures and sells
    agricultural farm equipment. Don't get too stuck on that, the main problem is
    to find something visually pleasing and it seems really hard to find.\r\n\r\nBTW
    I tried with some serif italics and it didn't look absolutely horrible, only a
    little. Maybe that would be the way to go?\r\n"
