  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I'm a complete wannabe &mdash; I even put that as my occupation in my profile &mdash; so go easy.

A while back I inherited the tedious upkeep on a minor project that has forever used a LOT of Helvetica fake small caps. It's just as awful as you think, and I can't stand it anymore. But I don't have the authority to completely overhaul the card.

I've tried some other sans-serifs with true small caps, but most of them are humanist and thus all wrong. I've found that you can get  [[http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.htm?pid=423642|an SC font of Akzidenz Grotesk]], but it leaves me feeling "Ennh."

Are there any realist sanses out there with nice-looking small caps?</div>

Wow. I'm a newbie, I've never seen a GX font in person before. Are they backwards-compatible with vanilla TrueType? Or do you have to basically have FontLab to use them these days?

Hey now, that's a lot closer to what I'm looking for! Thanks!

The only problem is that there's a dark side to my situation. I'm a lone design-conscious mercenary in a company that epitomizes design bankruptcy.† There's a very large central repository of fonts we're licensed to use, but we don't have direct access to it; instead, we have to contact a representative who searches the repository for us.

My point is that I can't just buy a font from any foundry; I have to find something that we're already licensed to use.

And my REAL point is that National, while an excellent candidate that I'm glad to know about, is a no-go, so I'd still like more suggestions if anyone has them. :)

Aha! By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif#Classification">realist</a> I mean Heros! 

Adventor is a geometric sans-serif, and is in fact a rip-off of Avant Garde. But Heros is a realist sans-serif, and is in fact a rip-off of Helvetica. And it does have small caps!

If we didn't have a license to the whole extant Helvetica family, I'd feel funny about using any of those. But we do, so I won't. :)  Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I took a look at Heros -- the small caps are OK, but would need a slight weight increase to match my Helvetica (but the accents over them should not have the weight increase). They also needed to be a touch larger; a small amount of vertical scaling would fix that.

The old style numbers seem to just be the regular numbers "moved" a bit, except, obviously, for the "1" and "2". The oldstyle "2" is just dreadful.

All in all, I don't think you could just use them directly with another foundry's Helvetica.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not using Heros with Helvetica, I'm replacing Helvetica entirely with Heros. :)

I know Heros isn't just spectacular; I don't like a few random features of some letters, and I could tell the small caps weren't perfect. But I'm not using the text figures at all (for which I think I have good reasons), and anything like a close approximation of true small caps is a drastic improvement, even with Heros's cons.

As far as mixing weights of Helvetica, well... that looks really good. I'm using InDesign CS, though, and I don't know of a way to have it automatically use a different font for the small caps. There's just enough text with just enough caps to make it really tedious to tweak the type manually.

I'll have to consider it, though, because now that I look at them side-by-side, the Helvetica one is far, far superior. Thanks. :)</div>
