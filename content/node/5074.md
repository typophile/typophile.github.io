body: 'Evening all -  <BR> <BR>I was hoping I could tap this board&#39;s divine wisdom
  for a moment and receive a little feedback / advice on an a4 leaflet I have designed.
  I&#39;m wanting the typography to be absoloutely water tight, and as one who&#39;s
  very much still learning his trade, a few words from those more experienced than
  I would prove invaluable.  <BR> <BR>The main typeface used is Adobe Warnock and
  I have used Interstate for the brief note on the back page. I&#39;m not convinved
  Interstate is the best choice - but with a limited number of fonts on my system,
  I think it&#39;s the best I can do. Suggestions of others to use still appreciated.
  Oh yes... there&#39;s also a Caslon fleuron on the front. <BR> <BR>Thank you all

    since the &#34;Sponsored by O&#39;Keeffe Solicitors&#34; is too equidistant with
    the following lecture. Second, as for Interstate, while it does look OK, I think
    <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/index.ep?cview=S128765Q&amp;clist=SQ">Quadraat
    Sans</a> would be more in the style of Warnock, but I&#39;d use it only if you&#39;ve
    already got it.'

    needs looking at. Quadraat Sans is bloody gorgeous. I&#39;m left feeling &#39;if
    only&#39;. <BR> <BR>What are your thoughts on the area where interstate is employed.
    Does it not seem a bit messy to you? The line lengths are pretty awkwards :-s
    and even fitting it all in there was a bit of squeeze. <BR> <BR>thanks again <IMG

  body: Yes, the line breaks are quite awkward. How about trying two columns within
    the box? You&#39;ll need to make sure to balance them, but it might look better.

  body: 'A few tiny points: <BR> <BR>1. I would lose the discretionary ligs. They
    give a slighly antiquarian, belle-lettristic impression. Asylum is too important
    &#40;and too &#34;modern&#34;&#41; a subject for that. You can probably keep the
    fleurons. <BR> <BR>2. Do you need the underlining. I hate underlining, and I would
    have thought the bold does the job well enough without. <BR> <BR>3. You have 4.00pm
    to 7:30pm &#40;ie full point in one time, colon in another&#41;. I think you should
    be consistent. <BR> <BR>4. Why are the dates in italic under the &#34;lectures&#34;
    heading on p.1? Why are the subtitles in italic but the lecture titles underlined
    in the brief details on p.2. Maybe there is a reason for this, but I can&#39;t
    see it immediately. <BR> <BR>5. Could you drop the bookings heading on p. 1 so
    that it aligned with venue and then use the full width of the textblock to give
    the dates and titles of the lectures. This is what people are really interested
    in. If they want to go to the lecture, they will search out the other information.
    But the subject of the lectures really needs to stand out. &#40;This I know because
    I&#39;m a lawyer and this is the kind of stuff we get all the time: what makes
    the difference is whether the topic of the lectures interests you.&#41; <BR> <BR>6.
    By the same token, I think there&#39;s too much prominence being given to the
    HJT Training mark, and not enough to the title. <BR> <BR>7. To my eye, page 1
    is dropping below down the page. <BR> <BR>8. I quite like the interstate, but
    I think it is so small that it looks like legal &#34;small print&#34; . It needs
    to be bigger and less apologetic.'

  body: 'Luke, I can see you&#39;re going the classic route, and have done a pretty
    good job of keeping it real. <BR> <BR>There are two things that jump out, as not
    being &#34;by the book&#34;. <BR> <BR>The first is, as Paul says, the underlining.
    It&#39;s not classic because you couldn&#39;t do it in metal -- in particular
    the way the underline passes through descenders is nasty. <BR> <BR>But I can see
    why you did it -- there is a complex hierarchy in the layout, you ran out of options,
    and the Warnock Bold does not appear sufficiently stronger than the Regular. But
    it is, and it should be, and if it&#39;s not, then the layout should be adjusted
    to give it enough prominence: try a little more space above the bold subheads.
    <BR> <BR>Secondly, the use of figures is inconsistent, mixing old style with lining.
    If you&#39;re going old-school, stick with the OSF everywhere, except in headings
    with all caps, where you should use roman numerals &#40;just kidding&#41;, I mean,
    cap height figures.'

    changed that badboy for Trade Gothic and have taken Steve&#39;s suggestion and
    used two columns. The long line length gave it that &#39;small print&#39; feel.
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; &#34;do you really need the table grid on page
    two?&#34;  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve grown quite fond of it. It&#39;s nice&#39;n&#39;neat.  <BR>

    <BR>I asked myself this question - if those words were greater than 3 letters

    best generally. I think you&#39;re right in this case Nick. Thanks.  <BR> <BR>Little
    question: With a time such as &#39;4.30&#39;, would you simply use a period or

    hmm, just me, but i would of used lining figs instead though. doesn&#39;t &#34;classical
    typography&#34; imply following those rules? oldstyle figs are for paragraphs
    then, right? no worries though, i think this works. is there any reason you have

    <BR> <BR>Well I purr-chased warnock bold, and I&#39;m glad I did. Underlining
    was the devil&#39;s solution. I also swapped Meta for Optima - I&#39;m sad it
    doesn&#39;t have old style figures, but its virtues more than outweigh that fact.
    Still a shame. Would be nice to keep right on the money. Few little minor tweaks
    here and there. Thanks again to everyone who&#39;s commented ;&#41; <BR>'

    anything to compare them with in the same document, you can &#34;fake&#34; old

    any other system&#41;.  <BR> <BR><b>Warning: This may offend purists!</b> <BR>
    <BR>First, if your main text is 12pt, make the numbers 11pt. For 2 and 0, shrink
    the vertical scale to %77; for 3 and 4 shrink the vertical scale to %94, and drop
    the number 1.1pt below the baseline. Play around with it, and see what you think.'
