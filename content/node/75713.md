  Fontforge and tried to use autohint, which gave me this error:\r\n\r\n'Error: font
  has neither StemSnapV nor StdVW!' \r\n\r\nI looked in PS Private and StemSnapV was
  already there in my source file, but many of the fields were removed in the OTF.
  I think I might try generating a ps file in the morning instead and see if that
  fixes that problem.\r\n\r\nBut what goes in StdVW? Fontforge doesn't automatically
  put the info in there for me. (:"

    StdVW is the first, most important value. \r\n\r\nAlso, there is a commandline
    switch (<code>-nb</code>) in AFDKO's autohint to disable the requirement for those
    values. \r\n\r\nA."
