  meets a Michael Harvey face (Ellington, Strayhorn). These letters are in bad repair.
  Is this a font or custom lettering? Smaller image below. See large image at http://loose-oddities.posterous.com/my-favorite-lettering-in-vancouver"

  body: Reminds me of one of Michael Harvey's designs but mixed with Albertus. Is
    this a font or custom lettering?

  body: "Most likely custom. One-off signs like this were still mainly a hand craft
    in the 60s. The <strong>P</strong> and the <strong>R</strong> are relatively wider
    than all the other characters, suggesting the designer was drawing inspiration
    from more than one alphabet. \r\n\r\nThe <strong>P</strong> and the <strong>R</strong>
    are close to Friz Quadrata, but that font wasn't designed until 1973, so if this
    sign really dates back to the 60s, your hunch about Albertus is right on."
