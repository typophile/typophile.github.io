    of the town council though - yeah, that's a GREAT name for a town, all in favour
    say 'Aye'.\r\n\r\nIt does say Kickapoo (not pod), doesn't it?\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "I\u2019ll second that.\r\nB. Schnelle has compiled a <a href=\"http://www.beepworld.de/members66/vau-ef-be/schriftliste1.htm\">great
    list of (metal) Blackletter faces</a>; at first glance I couldn\u2019t spot anything
    close. Then, a lot of the faces lack images. For some of them, one could find
    samples via searching for their names in the <a href=\"http://www.global-type.org/Searching.743.0.html\">Global
    Type database</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, it definitely says \u2018Kickapo<strong>d</strong>\u2019
    \u2013 if you compare it to other gothic faces like <a href=\"http://www.preusstype.com/fleischmann.php\">Fleischmann-Gotisch</a>."

  body: "Being that I'm pretty sure it's supposed to say Kickapoo, what we've got
    here is either a calligrapher who didn't realize what he/she was doing when he/she
    made that o to look like a d, or it was a metal sort out of sorts that nobody
    was typographically swift enough to catch (this is very small town, rural Wisconsin,
    1925...easy enough to believe) or the person setting it did notice it and thought
    it must be a \"fancy o\" and used it for flavor. Either way, it all of sudden
    has some pretty funny mystery and/or lore attatched to it.\r\n\r\nOr, it really
    was the Kickapod Scout. And if that's the case, I'm going to suggest they change
    the name of the paper to the Kickapod Crane. There are a few cranes around here.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Mister Fischer...Agreed. That sort of sums up why we moved here a few years
    ago. Sweden, eh? Coincidentally, tangentially, and further-off-topically, I've
    recently been cranking the latest [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Lekman|Jens
    Lekman]]. Jens rules.
