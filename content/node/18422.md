  body: The image must be 72 dpi before you copy. Be sure to un-check "resample" in
    Photoshop before changing the resolution. (FWIW, I think this is a pointless limitation.
    It just makes for extra work and is counterintuitive.)

  body: Apparently, FL looks at the physical dimensions of the image (in inches, points,
    whatever) and converts it to 72 dpi before pasting. The only way to get all the
    pixels is to make the conversion yourself beforehand. It doesn't make much sense,
    but that's how it works.
