  at work, Mandarin (simplified) & English. I am acutely conscious of my complete
  lack of sensibility. In the short time I have available on the project I would like
  to begin to address this and hopefully gain a little understanding along the way.\r\n\r\nMaybe
  what I need breaks down into two categories:\r\n\r\n\u2022 General rules for typesetting
  - for equivalent example in Latin: No orphans\r\n\u2022 Strong editorial style -
  perhaps there are some Chinese design blogs out there\u2026\r\n\r\nThank you all"

  body: "Chapter 7, <em>Typography</em>, of my latest book entitled [[http://oreil.ly/CJKV2E|<em>CJK
    Information Processing</em>]] (Second Edition), covers much of what you need.
    In general, Chinese typsetting is a subset of the features required for Japanese
    typesetting. There are no spaces, so windows and orphans are handled on a per-character
    basis, meaning that some characters are prohibited from ending lines, and some
    are prohibited from beginning lines. Horizontal writing is preferred in China,
    so you shouldn't need to deal with the additional intricacies of vertical writing.\r\n\r\n--
