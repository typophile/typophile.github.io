    got to realize that you get what you pay for. In most cases, free fonts lack the

    going for projects that I am in the process of working on now, and I need help.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Not knowing anything about how long you&#39;ve been around graphic design,
    or advertising, apart from your being a recent student &#40;according to your
    profile here&#41;, I&#39;d like to interject one thing, if I may. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    very important to have a budget for type that somehow relates to how you are choosing
    to run your studio, or how you might be a working designer within an agency. Or,
    a publication designer for an alumni magazine. <BR> <BR>A possible approach: <BR>
    <BR>1&#41; Whittle down to a short list of which legitimately sold, commercial
    fonts that you might want to start with.  <BR> <BR>At an absolute minimum? <BR>
    <BR>Two four-weight type families would give you great flexibility; one being
    a sanserif family and one being a serif family. Ok, add one more: You should probably
    have at least one useful script font that you wouldn&#39;t be embarassed to use
    repeatedly. <BR> <BR>Each of the four-weight families would have a Book, Bold,
    Book Italic and Bold Italic. For flexibility. <BR> <BR>That might come to about
    $150 to $200. <BR> <BR>Too costly for one month? <BR> <BR>2&#41; Choose one of
    the four-weight families, and just buy that.  <BR> <BR>3&#41; Here&#39;s the only
    hard part: Which one? <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll do yourself and your client a great
    favor by using something credible but <BR>a&#41; Not a System Font; <BR>b&#41;
    Not a typical newspaper or magazine text font; <BR>c&#41; Not something you see
    everyday. <BR> <BR>Quiz your client&#40;s&#41; on their preferences, in very general
    terms, for serif or sanserif in display and in text. <BR> <BR>If they express
    no preference, or trust you as designer implicitly &#40;which is where you can
    get to over time when you do things proactively and responsibly to engender the
    client&#39;s trust&#41;, then simply choose what you like. Don&#39;t get too hung
    up with serif versus sanserif, to start out. <BR> <BR>The point is to start giving
    your work the legitimacy of using authentically crafted, high quality fonts. And
    to start right from the get go, doing something unique. <BR> <BR>Check out that
    the character sets are complete and well made, and that the fonts have adequate
    kerning and spacing that actually does work. Make sure the mood suits your needs,
    and that the numbers &#40;figures&#41; and currency marks and punctuation do what
    they&#39;re supposed to. <BR> <BR>You can simply e-mail or phone the type foundries
    and ask. They &#40;and we&#41; love to get questions from designers who have made
    type important to their work. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the surprisingly easy part,
    if you open your mind to it:  <BR> <BR>4&#41; Get the client to pay for it! <BR>
    <BR>Within the structure of a project or campaign quote, the cost of fonts is
    very inexpensive. If you work with historically cheap clients, it will simply
    be necessary to take them through what you&#39;re trying to bring to their project
    or campaign through uniqueness. Discuss it as a natural extension of the branding
    effort. Which, after all, is true. <BR> <BR>Trust me, it works! But the responsible
    designer starts to consider the need for distinct, quality typefaces and build
    that in early, into the early strategizing and into the early quote discussions
    and paperwork. It&#39;s every bit as crucial to the long term credibility of your
    work as buying illustration or photography will be. And since type often carries
    where there&#39;s no budget at all for illustration or photography, one could
    make the point that it&#39;s more crucial. <BR> <BR>All that is a much more important
    consideration to your design career than spending lots of time that could be used
    for creativity, instead trying to &#39;score free fonts&#39;. Much more important.
    <BR> <BR>Good luck. And don&#39;t forget: It&#39;s your career that you&#39;re
    formulating. Your life&#39;s work! <BR> <BR>Joe <BR>'

    have to ask, then, why spend time with fonts that you as a designer might have
    to avoid using? <BR> <BR>A graphic designer or art director, etc., of course spends
    much of their career on deadline. Often impossible deadlines. Isn&#39;t it better
    for a former student entering the profession to ground themselves in known quality
    and acknowledged reliability first? <BR> <BR>&#40;How to find out who&#39;s who?
    In addition to lists like this, design organizations can guide to quality type
    manufacturers.&#41; <BR> <BR>Many in this group will likely have the tools to
    open up a font. And from there, determine by educated guess whether it might be
    reliably enough built to trust on a real-world deadline job with thousands of
    the client&#39;s dollars and your reputation, all on the line. <BR> <BR>But even
    if you have the tools, there&#39;s still a learning curve to really being able
    to tell. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t mean to get into a big to-do about this, but it
    seems to me that for a person who&#39;s serious about a design career - and if
    they think they might want to actually advance to a stellar career - knowingly
    spending time with questionably made fonts is a counterproductive career move.  <BR>
    <BR>Just as you&#39;d never want to commission art from a truly lame illustrator.
    Or photography from a terrible photographer. <BR> <BR>For the design professional,
    why surround oneself with mediocrity? <BR> <BR>Yes, for amateurs and collectors,
    there is nothing at all wrong with seeking out free fonts...as long as the are
    not unlicensed commercial properties. Have fun!  <BR> <BR>As in other collecting
    pursuits, starting by obtaining catalogs and then going from there to seeking
    out actual fonts is a more sensible, logical starting point rather than starting
    by scouring the internet everything that&#39;s free and trying to max out your
    font menu. <BR> <BR>Especially for the beginner and near-beginner, those can be
    overwhelming and confusing. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR>'

    pirates - or those who believe that font pirates are some kind of godlike style
    leaders - truly realize how much collateral damage they do to the type profession.
    It&#39;s quite a lot of ongoing, serious damage. <BR> <BR>Could it be related
    to all the hyperventilating about terrorism? Sure. It&#39;s exactly that, on a
    software plane.  <BR> <BR>It destroys profitability and the ability to create
    taxable income to buoy the countries the commercial foundries reside in. <BR>
    <BR>Worst of all, the widespread, longterm financial effect is to slow growth
    in commercial font development. <BR> <BR>For all the development seen since 1984,
    there would be quite a lot more, and there would be many more staff and intern
    position availabilities at commercial foundries, if pirates were seen as what
    they really are, and shunned. <BR> <BR>Want your country out of its bad economic
    state? Think about the billions of real dollars lost to software piracy annually,
    globally. Font piracy, in it&#39;s corner, takes its toll and contributes to the
    bad economic conditions that have been plaguing us all for so long. <BR> <BR>As

    &#40;silly term, shouldn&#39;t have used it&#41; with some very nice typefaces.
    I can&#39;t complain about those. It is a step forward and does help students
    move away from using the system fonts. <BR> <BR>I know for a fact that Berkelee
    College of Music in Boston now requires students to purchase laptops. I think
    that makes a lot of sense. I remember in the days when I was a student, before
    it became somewhat common for students to own there own, for the running excuse
    to be, &#34;there were no computers left to use.&#34; Those days are gone. Computer
    labs are common. But, you still face the problems of font usage and abusage.

  body: Grant Hutchinson had earlier said <BR> <BR>&#62;&#34;Victor Gaultney spoke
    regarding Gentium at  <BR>&#62;TypeCon last week. The project is still very much  <BR>&#62;alive,
    and there are future plans to expand the  <BR>&#62;family - time and resources
    willing.&#34; <BR> <BR>and I meant to reply.... <BR> <BR>That&#39;s great news!
    What an excellent, excellent body of work Gentium is. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t yet
    had the luxury of studying every character independently, but overall, it&#39;s
    very nice. Awe-inspiring. <BR> <BR>And I still thank my lucky stars that I never
    encountered that dog photo &#40;used in Mr Hutchinson&#39;s sidebar photo above&#41;
    in an animated Flash way.  <BR> <BR>Still photo, ink on paper, was &#40;ahem!&#41;
    more than enough. <BR> <BR>&#40;When it originally appeared, did it make everyone
    want to buy more fonts? Or less?&#41; <BR> <BR>Joe <BR>

    &#34;there were no computers left to use.&#34; must be terribly frustrating to
    students. <BR> <BR>The Adobe pack seems like a great idea.  <BR> <BR>Yes, unbelievably
    low-priced bundles do dilute the potential market for type in the strictest sense,
    but such a pack makes a great entry level volume.  <BR> <BR>And at least coming
    from Adobe Systems, one can be assured of more quality, much more, than, say,
    the $10. CD of fonts down at the OfficeMax end aisle bin. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad
    to see type makers reaching out to students.  <BR> <BR>&#40;To students and educators:
    e-mail and phone type makers and tell them what you think you need, that you aren&#39;t
    currently seeing available for educational use. You can bet they&#39;d love to
    hear from you. All the type makers I know take any and all suggestions to heart.&#41;

  body: Hrant said <BR> <BR>&#62;&#34;No, I want my country out of the clutches of  <BR>&#62;American
    vulture megacorporations. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll definitely second that.  <BR> <BR>That
    major U.S. corporations are still cooking the books &#40;according to the press
    this week&#41; is cause for serious pause. And action. <BR> <BR>I was looking
    at a copy of Fortune from 1968 that I picked up at a tag sale awhile back - because
    of the ads inside - and I was struck by an ad by the NYSE - a two-page spread
    - touting their stringent guidelines for being listed on that board.  <BR> <BR>In
    the aftermath of all the recent tomfoolery, I could look at that 1968 list and
    say, gee, they hardly had any standards for acceptance at all.  <BR> <BR>Shocking
    stuff, really. <BR> <BR>&#60;political_foray&#62;  <BR> <BR>It really is time
    for middle managers everywhere to rise up and - yea, though I slog through the
    valley of capitalist darkness - to overthrow the supposedly bright corporate leaders.
    <BR> <BR>Yea, let Dilbert be your guide. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m only half kidding. After
    four years of this, it really is time to do something. Anything. The sheer numbers
    of unemployed is truly staggering. <BR> <BR>&#60;/political_foray&#62; <BR> <BR>
    <BR>Of course, in the words of one former knockoff font &#39;vendor&#39; now long
    gone, all for-profit type manufacturers make up the &#39;heinous capitalist oligarchy&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>So, maybe the overthrow should start with for-profit type makers! <BR>

    to the point of mania. <BR> <BR>Probably true in some corners.  <BR> <BR>But I
    really believe that most type designers who are put into a position of feeling
    that they have to speak out to protect their work &#40;as Mr Zapf has on so many
    occasions, and with such eloquence&#41; that they do so very reluctantly. <BR>
    <BR>Even if they have had their expenses paid for the travel and lodging, by their
    publisher. <BR> <BR>I think most would rather be in the studio, drawing.  <BR>
    <BR>And living and working with the conviction that they will be paid at least
    enough annually to minimally survive without taking second or third jobs pumping
    gas or delivering the mail. <BR> <BR>Out of curiosity: Are there any documented,
    true stories of type designers out there actually living a millionaire lifestyle?
    Have there been any documented over the past 100 years? <BR> <BR>Bruce Rogers?
    Eric Gill? Goudy?  <BR> <BR>High rollers? <BR> <BR>&#40;With all the money Gill
    apparently saved on underwear, surely....&#41; <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR>'
