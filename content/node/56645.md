    the users, they would probably say that a normal license should allow @font-face
    usage without any extra costs. The real question is: Will the pay extra when they
    have no other option? But that really depends on the font and (in most cases)
    the client of the designer. \r\nA large corporation with a unique corporate font
    will probably be very happy to use their font online, even if they would have
    to pay an expensive server/website/annual fee. But for a fancy display font you
    might rather want to reach other users (but a lot of them) like bloggers who pay
    \ tiny fee. \r\nIt's really hard to say at the moment. We usually establish the
    right price for something by comparison, but there is market for @font-face yet.
    So some vendors need to step forward and just try out different models. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>Why do you make a difference between the two?</cite>\r\n\r\nBecause
    SIFR does all the rendering server side while @font-face is redistributing my
    fonts for client-side rendering. And SIFR isn\u2019t sending copies of my font
    to anyone who downloads it."

  body: 'Sure, but that''s just the technical background. I understand your logic,
    but as a normal user I wouldn''t understand why you would charge sIFR on a server
    basis and @font-face on a website basis. I wouln''t care where the font the is
    rendered. '
