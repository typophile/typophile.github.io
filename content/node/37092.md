body: "i am looking for a decent script & display typeface, something along the lines
  of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/nothing/|nothing]] (and ideally included
  in adobe fontfolio or linotype gold collections)... any suggestions welcome.\r\n\r\ni
  really appreciate how helpful people are in this forum. I would like to find an
  opportunity to give back, but it those are hard to come by given the general experience
  level around here..."
