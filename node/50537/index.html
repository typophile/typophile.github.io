  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,
I&rsquo;d like to get your thoughts on this design I drew up.  The focus of the label is old-time American folk, pre-war/post-war blues, and the like.  My aim is to create a clean script logotype, with some of the quirks and charm of a hand drawn logo of that era, while still looking well-crafted.</p>
<p>Anything you would change in the weights, kerning, curves? Should I round out the hard edges?  I will be staring at it until it looks perfect.  This started as a (crude) hand-drawn sketch and was traced.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>You are mixing styles David. Part of it is italic(Arrighi) and part modern (Bodoni) or even Old style.. I think that is where the disconnect comes in for me. Look at your branching&hellip; they do not match. Look at your bowls&hellip; they do not match the other letters. The u does not reflect the h, n and m. The e,r o and p do not match the m,n, and h. The bowl of the e is way to large. And the r is a script r&hellip; based on the n,m,h it would have to be an italic r.</p>
<p>Choose what style you are trying to convey. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like where you are going it just has to have continuity.</p>

<p>I personally think a design like this allows for some mixing of styles, but do agree with you that the bowls should match with everything.  Harmony with the curves, weights, heights and kerning are the most important to me. The label covers different styles within a semi-specific era, so I think some mixing of typographic styles may not be too harmful, and may hopefully give it some character.  I originally had more of an italic r, but it seemed to stagger the rhythm a bit.</p>
<p>I am curious about how the u doesn&rsquo;t reflect the m, h, and n.  This is definitely not the only thing I do, so I appreciate hearing what stands out to you.</p>

<p>So many times I have watched these things go through the Typophile committee process.</p>
<p>This IS a great committee to be processing things through and I think it is cool that you are dealing with everything everybody is saying.</p>
<p>But I think you might be losing some of the original innocent charm your first design possessed.</p>
<p>In the end, I hope you take a breath and look back at where you started. Obviously, you know what you are doing &ndash; that was a darned nice piece of art to start with.</p>

You do say you want to create a well-crafted script logotype with some hand drawn quirkiness. It&rsquo;s up to you to determine the balance between well-crafted and quirky. The one thing that appears discordant to me, is the o with a line through it.

<p>@Robby: I think taking a step away from this and returning to it would be a good thing (it&rsquo;s only been 48 hours since its initial rendering).  I do feel that the more refinements that are made, the less charm it has, but the control does become appealing in it&rsquo;s own right.  It will be good for me to understand for myself just how much control there should be.  The logos for many of the labels releasing blues and folk music on 78s have a very innocent charm to them, but at the same time it is apparent that the lettersmith behind them is trained and skilled.  Though charming as they are, they&rsquo;re definitely not heavy-handed.</p>
<p>examples:

<p>I agree that this is a great committee to process things through, and what I take from it is very valuable, especially when it comes to the little nip/tucks.  Though some things should be taken with a grain of salt, I do appreciate tremendously what more experienced folks have to say.  I&rsquo;m always looking to learn and understand my own limitations.</p>
<p>@asvetic: good point in making the o&rsquo;s a bit larger.  I do like bobbling baseline, but limiting the occurences of the swoop down would make those occasions more powerful and less sloppy. ie. raising the connecting stroke of the m, but leaving the e and h.</p>
<p>@pica: there&rsquo;s definitely something happening with the p-h.  I think creating the stop there helps the eye in reading this correctly, and the descender/ascender matching is intended to unify the letters to each other.  Though, I am unsure of the bottom-left of that h.  It leaves less white space than every other letter-to-letter connection.</p>
<p>@kirsten: my intention for the line through the o is to signify the numeral zero, known to have a slash-through at times.  I am however sensitive of my own association with labels ending in &lsquo;phon&rsquo; being of eastern-European origin.</p>
<p>Progress to come shortly!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Presuming this is meant to be on 12&quot; vinyl labels have you tested it out at the correct size for them yet? A 12&quot; label is just 4&quot; diameter, so you can probably fit this across 3&quot; without the centre hole cutting anything off. Do you think you might lose the fine stroke of the r and the one across the first o at that size? Even on a CD you couldn&rsquo;t be much wider than 4&quot;.</p>
<p>I love what you have done. To me the o&rsquo;s also have a music notation look and I like the fact that they look like type where the rest looks hand lettered.</p>

<p>If you right click and press &ldquo;view image&rdquo;, you can see the whole picture without any side scrolling. Atleast you can in Firefox.</p>
