body: "I'd like some feedback on a logo I made.\r\n\r\nThe logo is for a party label
  called 'Katerdag na de Zaterdag' which is Dutch. It literally means hangoverday
  after the saturday. Doesn't rhyme in English though. \r\nI first tried to come up
  with an idea for a logo instead of logotype. That didn't work out to good. Then
  I came up with the idea you can see below. The K and the Z intertwined into a sort
  of ribbon. \r\n\r\nThe idea behind Katerdag na de Zaterdag is to organize party's
  on a sunday when everybody's kind of mellow. The dj sets are recorded and put up
  on a website (which I also have to design)\r\n\r\nSo the idea behind the logo is
  that the party on sunday flows naturally out of the saturday.\r\n\r\nThe guys I'm
  designing this for already had a kind of idea of how they wanted it to look. They
  had thought about a sketchy look, where you can still see the drawing lines, but
  i actually like the clean one (first one) better. \r\n\r\nOh, probably a good thing
  to mention... I haven't put many time in the type itself, so it still needs some
  work. Suggestions are more then welcome however.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/katerdag_4752.jpg]"

  body: Gosh..it's soo..Dutch:D Take it as a compliment. I actually like the last
    one bottom right and the reversed version. Feel the "sketchy" one with too many
    lines spoils it..and the first one, while nice, doesn't capture the idea succinctly
    enough. My two cents:D

  body: "left upper corner, it the K and the Z stay the most readable\r\n\r\n\r\nanders
    gezegd, de links boven je k en je z blijven het meeste gewoon letter, die transpatatie
    zorgt er voor dat de de lijnen goed doorlopen. die gearceerde schaduwen trekken
    te veel de aandacht en zonder 'iets' is te veel een losse krul.\r\n\r\nmoet erbij
    zeggen dat ik em h\xE9\xE9l mooi vind!"

  body: "So you both agree that the sketchy one isn't the best. Problem is that the
    guys i'm designing it for, like the sketchy version the most. Perhaps with some
    adjustments it could be a compromise.\r\nAnd thanks for the compliments. I wonder
    what's so Dutch about it though."
