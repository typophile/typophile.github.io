  body: Seems like a slightly altered <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.107886.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Rotisserie&sampleSize=48">Albertus

  body: "Correcting myself...\r\n\r\nIt is probably <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.107024.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Rotisserie&sampleSize=74\">Holland
    Title</a>, slightly condensed with a fat stroke affecting the fill shape, and
    other small alterations. \r\n\r\nHolland Title is a great alternative to Albertus
    which I've neglected until now."

  body: "Interesting near-Albertus to consider in the future, Stephen. Thanks.\r\n\r\nDesigners:
    (blank), Trademark Info: N/A --> this seems to be the case far too often with
    the Fontshop offerings. Do you happen to know where Holland Title came from and
    (meant as constructive criticism) is anyone working to fill in these Fontshop
    blanks?"

  body: I share your concern. I clench my teeth every time I see a blank credit. Sometimes
    it's our fault, but sometimes we're provided with no info from the foundry. In
    this case, it's Monotype Imaging, and <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=205066&grab_id=0&page_id=9155&query=holland%20title">they
    fully credit Hollis Holland</a>. I'll see that it's fixed on our end.

  body: "I've always heard the \"old timers\" at Compugraphic speak highly of [[Hollis
    Holland]], who was the first design director (Senior Typeface Designer) for the
    company. He was an accomplished calligrapher and book jacket designer years before
    he came to CG.\r\n\r\nHere's a snipet from the archives:\r\n\r\n<em><strong>1973</strong>
    - Compugraphic enters into a new technology with introduction of the VideoSetter\xAE
    I and II. The VideoSetter has an operating speed in excess of 400 lines per minute,
    making it particularly attractive to the newspaper market for handling classified
    advertisements and stock market text, as well as body text. This year marks its
    first release of a typeface exclusively developed by Compugraphic. Named for its
    creator, Senior Typeface Designer Hollis Holland, Holland Seminar was promoted
    for high-quality promotional literature.</em>"

  body: Thanks Norbert. I know very little about history of the 'graphics (Compu and
    Scan) so I appreciate all the background you can illuminate.
