  body: "I'm not sure what fonts you're referring to on mmparis.com. Looks like simple
    HTML specifying Monaco.\r\n\r\nvllg.com - Are you speaking of the \"mudTyper\"?
    This is a Javascript designed by <a href=\"http://www.mudcorporation.com/\">MudCorp</a>.\r\n\r\nunderware.nl
    - The animation you see on that page is a simple animated GIF. The rest of the
    text is Verdana, called by CSS.\r\n\r\nWhat would you like to do with the embedded
    bitmap fonts? Will they require interaction from the user or simply present information?"

    <a href="http://www.artypapers.com/csshelppile/pcdtr/">PHP+CSS</a> or <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr/">Flash</a>,
    I think.

  body: '<a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr/">sIFR</a> is great. It''s Flash,
    but Flash is basically on every computer, so I hope you don''t count it as "an
    extension." I''m using it on one of my pages, and I can only speak wonders of
    it. '

  body: "Usually, whenever you see a typeface on the web that is not a font installed
    on most operating systems, it's displayed as an image. The easiest way to tell
    if it's an image is to try to select the text. If you can, it's a font that you
    have on your machine, and not an \"embedded bitmap\". If you can't, it's an image.
    (There are a few rare exceptions, such as sIFR, that Dan mentioned.)\r\n\r\nThis
    is the case with Unibody on the Underware page. Take the \"NEW\" icon, for example.
    The type is set in an app like Photoshop, output as a GIF and displayed on the
    page as an image. The rest of the text on that page is set in Verdana, as indicated
    in the <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/underwarebasic.css\">site's CSS</a>.
    \r\n\r\nStill not seeing the vllg.com bitmap. Can you tell us exactly which words
    you're seeing in this font?"
