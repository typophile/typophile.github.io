  management consultant that is well hinted for Mac and Windows, I might end using
  it for my reports too if it can be embed in Word. Currently I am using Georgia+Verdana
  for screen and document sharing as it is \u201Cstandard\u201D but I am considering
  investing on something more \u201Cexclusive\u201D.\r\n\r\nThank you for your expert
  advice.\r\n\r\nRegards, Carlos."

  body: "Hi Carlos. \r\n\r\nAll the web fonts from Monokrom are hinted by hand, optimized
    for ClearType and the rendering engines that follows ClearType on Windows. \r\n\r\nThe
    \u201CScreen\u201D stuff is also drawn to perform especially well in low resolution
    environments. Unfortunately, we haven\u2019t thought of the possibility that people
    might be interested in using hinted fonts outside of the web, so our web licenses
    only cover online use (and mockup). Maybe this kind of usage should be part of
    what we now call an App license (seeing that these are also hand-hinted TrueType
    fonts), or maybe we should considering a hinted TT option for the Desktop license.
    In any case, we\u2019d be happy to discuss an arrangement if you are interested
    in licensing any of our typefaces.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what we have to offer, but
    there are surely others that deliver high-quality text type for screen. The RE
    series from Font Bureau come to mind, Typotheque\u2019s Screen series, Commercial
    Type have a very nice way of showing the rendering under various systems directly
    on their website, anything that crossed the desk of Tiro Typeworks (obviously),
    Letters From Sweden, FontFont, I\u2019m guessing Dalton Maag walks the extra mile
    (judging by their recent job openings and current staff), Just Another Foundry
    is another foundry that takes the screen seriously, and I know first hand M\xE1rio
    Feliciano offers well hinted stuff."
