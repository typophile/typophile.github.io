body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently trying to set some text in Indesign which contains
  quote marks. Some of the quote marks are lining flush to the left-hand edge of the
  text column &#40;the text is set ragged right&#41;. Am I correct in thing that these
  quote marks need to be set outside the text column, and if so, how do I do this
  in Indesign? Can anybody help! <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance <BR> <BR>Darren
