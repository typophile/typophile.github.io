body: "I'm pleased to announce that legendary adman George Lois and web pioneer Jeffrey
  Zeldman are coming on board with us. George has given me his permission to use my
  favorite quotation of his: \"Great ideas can't be tested. Only mediocre ideas can
  be tested.\"\r\n\r\nJeffrey Zeldman, who helped launch TypographyShop into the blogosphere
  and beyond will soon be selling shirts with his iconic pixelated mug and the phrase
  \"since 1990.\" No name, no url. Like Che, Jeffrey needs no branding.\r\n\r\nJeffrey's
  a huge fan of Mr. Lois. I'm not sure if George has heard of Mr. Zeldman. I'm honored
  to have them both on board.\r\n\r\nGeorge told me that he's had many an offer over
  the years to produce shirts or buttons with his witticisms on them, but never bit
  until now. George's royalties from sales of the shirt will be going to the Herschel
  Levit scholarship fund at Pratt Institute, Lois' alma mater. The award is named
  for Lois' mentor. According to George he \"threw me out of school by getting me
  my first job, designing for the great Reba Sochis. Six months later I got drafted
  and went to Korea \u2013 but it was worth it.\"\r\n\r\nWelcome aboard boys."
