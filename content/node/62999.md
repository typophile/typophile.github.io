  will act as a handbook for designers needing to produce great creative work with
  very small budgets.\r\n\r\nTo avoid hypocrisy, the designer of the book needs to
  create it at low cost. This involves using a free typeface!\r\n\r\nAny good suggestions?"

  body: There's a distinct difference between low cost and free. Is the designer providing
    their design services for free? Is the author giving away this book?

    using open source software on a recycled c.2001 Linux based desktop located at
    your local library, then to use a free font would be equally hypocritical. \r\n\r\nHypocrisy
    is the greatest luxury. So they say. "

  body: "Who is the audience for this book?\r\n\r\nI wish to point something out regarding
    the demographics of computer-based designers. The most expensive and the most
    free software is often the same product. This is because pirates always target
    the most expensive release.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the people who want to pay
    the reassuringly high price and the people who spend their time acquiring the
    free - each end up with the same product! In software, second place means obscurity.\r\n\r\nIt
    is hypocritical when Adobe or Microsoft complain about pirates, because when pirates
    take Adobe or Microsoft products, it is their competitor who loses money!\r\n\r\nThere
    are some people in the middle, who might be smarter or more honest, and who would
    probably love a book that explains how to use their purchases.\r\n\r\nReturning
    to the book, is the target audience computer-based?"
