  concept using the font \"Yanone Kaffeesatz.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.yanone.de/typedesign/kaffeesatz/\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to find some fonts that are similar in shape to Yanone (humanist, condensed,
  san-serif, rounded, with multiple weights), but maybe have some more distinct characteristics.
  Yanone is a great font, but it just feels a bit \"vanilla\" for my purposes.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?"
