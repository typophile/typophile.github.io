  body: "I think Bickham Script is the right answer, but those letters/endings are
    part of the alternate glyphs that you need to use OpenType-savvy applications
    to access. (the e has an added ending character stuck on to it).\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Well, I have to back off that answer. I just tried it with Bickham Script,
    and it's close but not identical, even in the 'p' (see attached sample).  Someone
    has done another adaptation of this script style besides Adobe, apparently.\r\n\r\n-

    original script model.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I am also having trouble confirming these letters in Champion Script. There
    is another possibility, and that is customization. I recently had someone send
    me a sample of script to ID and I said it looked like Bickham, but not exactly,
    and then he told me that he had done it himself by modifying Bickham Script. He
    showed me the word 'Hope' and I think it had a similar p with a closed bowl and
    loop, like this one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
