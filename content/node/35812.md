  body: Thanks. I just took a look at that font, but it's not quite it. AT McCullough
    has distinct serifs on the "T" that aren't there on the image I uploaded. The
    "W" looks different too.

  body: "Hmm, for me it looks like more like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/britannic-lt/\">Britannic</a>
    in a heavier weight. But what do I know? Anyway appreciate your work, Mr. Curtis.
    \r\n\r\nEDIT: Ya, like the earlier people said. (At the first post we were just
    secs apart ...)"
