body: "We received a Russian translation for a Dutch brochure as an MS Word document.
  Our contact in the Netherlands says the text opens and displays perfectly on her
  PC, but when we open the document on our Macs or import it into Adobe InDesign CS
  all cyrillic characters are substituted by underscores. We have tried this using
  different fonts -- the default Arial (which I presume is Unicode), Myriad Pro OpenType,
  Helvetica LT OpenType and Pragmatica. Neither of them do the job.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know if there is a way I can check which coding was used for this Cyrillic text,
  or is there anyone who is willing to take a quick look at the attached text and
  tell me what I need to do to access the cyrillic characters?\r\n\r\nThank you very
  much,\r\n\r\nYves"

    the typeface to Myriad Pro and it displays something that looks a lot like real
    Russian to me.\r\nSo it appears to be Unicode...\r\nHope this helps."

    into an InDesign doc. At first this displays as a lot of gobbledygook (default
    font is Myriad). Changing font formatting to Myriad Pro solves this. Seems to
    me be the same as the Word file...'

  body: "Hi Bert and John, thank you so very much for looking into this.\r\n\r\nBert,
    it is weird that you did what I think was the same as I did and it works for you
    but not for me. I'll try a couple of different settings, because if it is Unicode
    it should indeed display correctly in InDesign CS with Myriad Pro. This is very
    frustrating...\r\n\r\nJohn, that's great of you to convert the document into text
    files. I know the attachments are not working yet -- the Punchcut guys are working
    on it and this feature should be back shortly. If you could e-mail them to me
    I'd be much obliged, thanks. Please send them to yves@makingmagazines.be"

    don't get it why it didn't work in the first place. I have one relieved lay-out

    I'll let <em>you</em> know more as soon as <em>I</em> know more. :-)"
