  \ Like say one owns Nelly Script. Can one sit and draw it and then use that drawing
  in a poster?\r\n\r\nSo say someone were doing a poster and instead of using the
  Nelly Script itself in the poster they hand drew the letters (and scanned them in)
  using Nelly script as a close reference. Is that copyright infringement or rightful
  use of something you own the right to use?"

  body: "Assume you\u2019re talking about fonts that look hand drawn, not high-fidelity
    copies? If so I've never seen a font license that mentions hand drawing/tracing.
    I've also never heard of anyone getting into trouble hand drawing or tracing a
    licensed typeface for use in a poster. However, I have heard of people getting
    cease and desists when they\u2019ve redistribute fonts that they\u2019ve hand
    drawn/traced using high profile commercial fonts as models \u2013 in these cases
    they were also using the original fonts name in the promotion of the hand drawn
    version - making this more of a trademark issue than a copyright issue.   "

  body: "yes it would not be to sell the font, but just to get a hand drawn look for
    the posters while using a typeface as a close inspiration.\r\n\r\nSo then would
    the license for the typeface include being able to look at it and hand draw it
    for graphic design work?\r\n\r\nLike if it was okay to use the font does that
    automatically make it okay to use a drawing of the font?"

    course. It's nothing else than applying Photoshop filters to a typeface or manipulate
    the outline to create a logotype. "

  body: "As I understand it, in the U.S., there is very little to protect a typeface.
    There is no copyright protection and only very novel and unique typefaces are
    able to argue for design patent protection. The primary legal protections come
    regarding the software, i.e. the font. Draw yourself silly. That's really old-school
    type work and I miss my days hunkered over an Art-O-Graph.\r\n\r\nAnd Simon is
    a Seahawks fan! I'm so sorry dude. [insert uncontrollable laughter]"

    there is no restriction in our EULA that prohibits you from creating an illustration
    that references for forms of the font and using that on a poster . . .\r\n\r\nWe'd
    love to see a copy when you print it, otherwise feel free to contact us in the
    future if you have any other questions or for your own future reference, definitely
    contact the font author since everybody has their own ways of doing things . .
