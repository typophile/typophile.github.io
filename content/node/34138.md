body: "I'm thinking of designing a symbol font. \r\n\r\nFonts like Wingdings, Carta,
  and Zapf Dingbats cover a lot of the bases already, so what is really lacking out
  there that would be genuinely useful? Are there some glyphs you've really wanted
  in a symbol font but couldn't find (which I'm sure you quite capably designed yourself,
  but let me know anyway)? or perhaps is there a whole set that, though they exist
  in an available symbol font, they don't complement the text fonts of your choice
  well enough to be useful? What other problems might your current range of symbols
  present that can be solved with a redesign?"
