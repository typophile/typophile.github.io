    target=_top>Neuzit S</a> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.steffmann.de" target=_top>
    Dieter Steffmann&#39;s website</a> has some autobiographical information.  It&#39;s
    in German so if you sprechen nicht Deutsches, you can use <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/"
    target=_top> babel fish</a> to translate.

    S was first used? <BR> <BR>The font is actualy called Neuzeit Grotesk &#40;&#39;New
    Age Grotesque&#39;&#41; and was designed by Wilhelm Pischner for the Stempel foundry
    in 1928. It&#39;s an integral part of the ancestry of the popular DIN Schriften
    fonts. <BR> <BR>As for your question, well, Google is your pal: <BR> <BR>Linotype

  body: 'When you say &#39;typographers&#39;, do you mean type designers?  There is
    a book called &#39;Rookledge&#39;s International Handbook of type Designers -
    A Biographical Directory&#39;  by Ron Eason &amp; Sarah Rookledge. There is another
    one called &#39;Twentieth Century Type Designers&#39; by Sebastian Carter. Both
    would be excellent resources if you want to know about type designers. Of course,
    these are not &#39;autobiographical&#39;, because they were not written by the
    designers, but I presumed that maybe your assignment didn&#39;t require more than
    biographical information. Your other course of action is to use <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/person/index.html"
    target="_blank">Designer links</a> at MyFonts.com, and to use Google to search
    for biographical information about well-known designers. '

  body: Thanks again for the info guys, i appreciate it alot! <BR>Yeah the thing is
    i have tried to find biographical information on google but i never seem to get
    much or what i want. <BR> <BR>Maybe im just crappy at finding info or something
    ^^;; <BR> <BR>Most of time, i can only dig up stuff relating to interviews.  <BR>Can
    anyone help me on some biographical info on Jonathan Barnbrook?  <BR>Also where
    would be a good place to get info on where certain types of fonts were first used?

  body: You aren&#39;t even using the information we told you about. On the MyFonts
    designers page they have <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/person/barnbrook/jonathan/"
    target="_blank">Jonathan Barnbrook</a> with a bunch of links that would probably
    have information about him. When you look up a font in MyFonts and many other
    vendor sites, they often tell you when the font was first used.  I think you are
    trying to sit back and take the lazy way out, and I&#39;m done helping if you
    won&#39;t do any work.

    have to agree with Mike on this one. Get yo&#39;  <BR>a$$ in gear and actually
    <i>DO</i> something! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
