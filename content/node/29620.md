    Typewriter</a> in a number of ways, but I see on closer inspection that it's only
    a 'first impression' resemblance.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "That's a good suggestion Hrant, but the closest I could find was in McGrew's
    book of 'American Metal Typefaces', and was called 'Paragon Plate' from 1901.
    Another typeface called 'Latin Expanded' also had some similar features, but many
    mismatches.\r\n\r\nI went through my copy of Jaspert's 'Encycopaedia of Type Faces',
    but saw nothing even as close as the preceding. As we have often bemoaned, there
    are not many good references for European typefaces.\r\n\r\nKara, how old is the
    newspaper this came from?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Ovink had a superb three-part article in Quaerendo (with a lot on the French
    scene) concerning the type genres that emerged as a reaction to the 19th century
    Didone domination. It's not at all a compendium of specimens, so is very unlikley
    to show this particular face, but might have good leads as to where to look. Another
    good potential reference are De Vinne's books.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
