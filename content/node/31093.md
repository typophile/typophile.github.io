  body: "Are you intending for it to be an 'omni' alphabet? Because at the moment,
    you are using for example, the 't' in it's uppercase form, which makes it a bit
    less legible; the t bears resemblance to the 'r' right now. I also think the cutting
    of the 'u' doesn't really serve a purpose, while the cut on the 'n' is nice.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    I think it's an interesting display font, especially if you add some weights to
    it. I really like the consistence in curves in 'a', 'e', 'n' and 'g'. I really
    like the quirkyness of letters like the bdqp, and the 'v' is amazing. \r\n\r\nedit;
    oh, and those numerals are very appealing!"

  body: it's a good face to show that you read words and not letters since you might
    not be able to understand the individual letters sometimes but in words it's easy
    to read.

  body: "I agree with Sebastiaan's comment on the \u2018t'. Most of the face is readable
    despite the overly stylized form, but the \u2018t' feels like it needs an ascender.
    In your title, you seem to have an uppercase version? While that almost comes
    across as an \u2018f', I think that's a good place to start.\r\n\r\nOn an \xE6sthetic
    note, i love it. Particularly drawn to the \u2018f', \u2018g', \u2018k' and \u2018v'."
