  that I am currently rebranding. The logo mark that I have created consists of circles,
  and therefore I am looking for a typeface to compliment it. \r\n\r\nI am preferably
  looking for a typeface that has a variety of weights, as their company name is split
  into two parts (3 letters, and then 'fitness') - so I have the option to play around
  with hierarchy. \r\n\r\nAny recommendations would be much appreciated. Willing to
  look at paid or free typefaces, so I can hopefully give the client a few options.
  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help :)"
