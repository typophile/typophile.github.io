  body: "Anyone? \r\nI have zero proficiency in Cyrillic languages, and require a
    native-speaking designer to create (3) and (4) below, and therefore also (1) and
    (2), for the sake of consistency:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1\r\nThe entire font complement
    of a design submitted to the competition should be shown on the first sheet, in
    a large font size. Depending on the design of the typeface, a single font size
    should be used for the capitals, the lower-case, and the small-cap glyphs. The
    font should include a Cyrillic glyph set, either the standard complement based
    on the Mac Cyrillic or Windows CP1251 codepage, or their part, allowing the composition
    of a text in one of the languages that use the Cyrillic alphabet.\r\n\r\n2\r\nIf
    the entry is a type family, the font complement of each constituent style should
    be shown on a separate sheet.\r\n\r\n3\r\nOn other sheets examples of the potential
    use of the typeface should be shown. They should be reflective of the purpose
    and the special features of the design, and to display the typeface in the very
    best way possible. These specimens or their details may be later used in the catalogue
    of the winning entries, and the publications related to the competition.\r\n\r\n4\r\nThe
    examples may include, but are not limited to, headlines, short or long passages
    of text, sample pages or double-page spreads of books and periodicals, screen
    shots of monitors, tablets, smart phones, and more. For body text typefaces designed
    for print, a sample text setting in various font sizes, from 6 to 14 pt., is mandatory.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nPlease
    contact nick\u2013at\u2013shinntype.com for information about my typeface."
