body: I'm looking for a typeface that looks like it was written in lipstick. And if
  there isn't a font like that, a effect in Photoshop or Illustrator that can create
  that look. Thanks for any help and suggestions.

    on a whiteboard with your own lipstick?\r\nAlternatively, you could use almost
    any thick handwritten font, and apply a filter in Photoshop / live trace in Illustrator"

  body: I would also suggest the DIY approach of writing it in actual lipstick, and
    then go about vectorizing or taking a picture of it, whichever the case may be.
    Might just be more of a person preference, but I would feel a much stronger sense
    of attachment by doing it that way. Hands on approach to something like that is
    also something great to achieve.

  body: I would agree with rax and Krebstar. Real lipstick will look better and more
    believable if you do it your self. Good luck.
