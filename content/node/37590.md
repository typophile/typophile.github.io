body: "brampitoyo and I have decided to start a font band. We will be hosting auditions
  for this online collaboration here on Typophile.\r\n\r\nTypical songs include the
  following hits:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Baby, kern me closer to you</li>\r\n<li>(Yves)
  Peters, give me one more chance</li>\r\n<li>The Futura Is Now</li>\r\n<li>And much
  much more!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5601.gif]\r\n\r\nBoth
  Bram and I play drums, guitar, bass, and we can sing a little too. We're in need
  of the following:\r\n\r\nA flugelhorn\r\nAn Alpenhorn\r\nA singerist\r\nA manager\r\nThe
  other stuff in the smarmy little graphic above with the horrendous font\r\nEtc.,
  you name it!\r\n\r\nWe're also excepting lyricistical ideas and mumblings. Please
  feel free to submit a link to something. Anything really. As long as it is good.
  Or not. \r\n\r\nI live in Seattle, Bram lives in Portland, and you live? We'll have
  to figure out the details later, but rest assured, we have the frontman straight
  from Typecon2007:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20070428_0013_3564.jpg]"
