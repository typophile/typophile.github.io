body: "This logo is for a boat called Aquaholic (the name should go over well with
  water patrol). She likes margaritas, so I used a margarita surrounded by tropical
  flowers, behind old parchment.\r\n\r\nI would like criticism on the illustration,
  but I would also like to know if there is a font that looks similar to what I have
  drawn in the thumbnail below. I have already tried the wedge serif Latin MT and
  I hate it. I don't know if what I have drawn is the best solution, but I want something
  more unused.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aqua_5218.gif]"

  body: I would just look at the 1st A & see if you can't get it working a bit better.
    I think it's angle is slightly off & it should be a little bigger. You might try
    it bigger than the other letters. Why stand on ceremony. It's a booze boat! The
    Q needs to be a bit bigger too I think. And maybe moove the right diamond to the
    right & make it bigger too. Your drawing seems head & shoulders over that line
    art. Which came 1st? The pencil drink looks MUCH tastier!

    vector art was many drafts later.\r\n\r\nI did what you all suggested. I traced
    my hand-drawn font, thickened the outer lines, reformed parts of the parchment
    to look more like the original thumbnail, and changed the inside of the flowers
    to look like the drawing. \r\n\r\nI still have to work out the lime. It is just
    floating behind the glass. I also have to possibly redraw the margarita inside
    the glass to look better.\r\n\r\nPlease keep the criticism coming. I have a feeling
    I will need it on my amateur attempt at type.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aqua4_5142.gif]"

  body: 'My suggestions: Move the cross bar of the H up. On the A too. But just a
    bit. Not as high as the H. The middle A in the drawing seems like a better shape.
    The verticals on it in particular. In your drawing the Serifs on the U are smaller
    & have a better shape. Id like to see the Q a bit bigger & maybe with a different
    tail. This one seems too restrained for a party ship. What about bending the lettershapes
    to match the ribbon more? The lines on the top & bottom of the ribbon could be
    thicker. I think it would create a stronger text focus which will make the mark
    stronger overall I think.'

    chunky wedges, top of the Q has about enough although it could be a touch wider.
    The diamonds could do with something to help them sit with the illustration style,
    you might also add in some shading on the back of the ribbon as your pencil drawing.\r\n\r\nI
    might be confused but isn't a Margarita a cocktail?\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: This is really great. My only crit might be the curve in the crossbars of
    all the letters. Because this is 2D, I find myself wondering if those curves aren't
    bumps in the banner. I might be tempted to draw a line which follows the curve
    of the banner and align my crossbar angles more to that.

  body: This is getting better & better. I really like the wave. I echo what Tiff
    said. Also, Rather than dink around with the letters one by one, as a technique
    I would print the thing minus the lettters & draw them in by hand a few more times
    until you get it to gel. It will be less frustrating, faster, more fluid & you
    have a better shot at getting it just right as a result. Digitizing the letters
    will be a snap after that. What about shading the leaves? I think the left side
    diamond still needs to be a bit bigger. Congradulations. It's gonna be sweet!

    version too? \r\n\r\nThe tail on the Q is really fippant now. I like that. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    try adjusting the shape of the O so it sits on the banner better. \r\n\r\nThe
    diamonds seems right now.\r\n\r\nThe AQUA letter could probably be just a bit
    bigger & taller to follow the banner shape & perspective better."

    dull for the fun feeling held in the illustration. Are you going for an old fashioned
    color scheme somehow? If so -  why? \r\n\r\nGot a pantone book? I could suggest
    some numbers to you. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime why not try this: take your darkest
    brown on the banner & apply it to the shaded parts of the banner, take the lightest
    brown & make it the base banner color & then use a pure white for highlights?
    The lime is almost in the army there. It neeeds saturation. Maybe make it a lemon?
    I would look at making the leaves a darker green, the flowers a brighter purple
    & the drink/wave a bright magenta pink. The glass could have two colors, a pale
    ( but saturated) blue for the glass & a mix of the two for the contents of that
    cup seen through the glass.\r\n\r\nActually, what is the reason for the color
    restriction? Do you want to use flat solid color rather than 4 color process? "
