  body: Archer is nice but it's all over Sweden right now!!! Magazines, ads, packages,
    advertising. It's getting pretty ridiculous actually... But I would say rather
    common as well. When something gets popular among the design community. It strikes
    pretty bad! i would say Archer is the typeface of the year in Sweden already ;-)
