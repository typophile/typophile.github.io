  body: "Could the top sample be News 701, or Clarion MT? \r\n\r\nThe second sample,
    \"MED RAKI,\" appears Bodoni-like but that bar on the E appears higher placed.\r\n\r\nI
    think the third and fourth samples are also a Bodoni.\r\n\r\nI believe the bottom
    one is Bodoni MT Condensed Bold.\r\n\r\nNo guarantees on the above! \r\n"

  body: "Two, three, and four look like URW Bodoni. The sixth looks like Monotype
    Bodoni, Bold Condensed. The first is some sort of century-style modern, like Bitstream's
    News705.\r\n\r\n"
