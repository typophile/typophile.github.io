  body: "Matthew, \r\n\r\nfor both OpenType PS (.otf) and OpenType TT (.ttf), you
    can use a UPM size anywhere up to 16,384, though the PostScript specification
    recommends that no glyph coordinates should extend the range -4000 to +4000. Adobe\u2019s
    recent complex-script fonts (Adobe Arabic, Adobe Hebrew, Adobe Thai) are OpenType
    PS and use a 2048 UPM. \r\n\r\nBut you\u2019re in no way limited to 1000 and 2048.
    You can use 1024, 1500, 2000, 2048, 2382, 3000, 3420, 4000 or whatever you like
    as UPM size. Doesn\u2019t matter. \r\n\r\nThe only limitation I was able to find
    so far is that for OpenType PS fonts with the UPM size other than 1000, the text
    cursor in InDesign CS (and older versions) would appear of wrong size (i.e. for
    a 2000 UPM font, if you select some text, on screen only the bottom half of the
    text will be selected and for a 3000 UPM font only the bottom third). But that\u2019s
    only a cosmetic screen display problem and it has been fixed in InDesign CS2.

  body: "William, \r\n\r\nFont Audit checks for situations that *may* indicate a mistake.
    Sometimes, people put two nodes next to each other by mistake but then don't notice
    it. The font gets produced with this unintentional quirk in the outline. The quirk
    is never harmful, but if unintentional, it's certainly ugly. And can get noticed
    if the letter is printed in a huge size, or cut in vinyl for example. \r\n\r\nHowever,
    it some cases, like that suggested by Lucas by the way of Nick, such outline quirks
    may be intentional. Font Audit has no way of knowing the designer's intention,
    so it flags various situations that may indicate a problem. \r\n\r\nI remember
    when I installed FontLab Studio on Matthew Carter's computer and was showing it
    to him, we opened one of this typefaces (I think Mantinia). I was walking through
    the glyphs and in one of them, there was the red Font Audit arrow. Matthew got
    very curious: \"Oh, what it that?\" So I explained him what Font Audit is, and
    then I clicked on the arrow to show the description of that particular problem.
    Matthew read the description, thought for a few seconds and said: \r\n\r\n\"I
    don't think so.\" \r\n\r\nThat basically sums up on what you should do with Font
    Audit warnings: read it, think about it, and make up your own mind. \r\n\r\nBest,
    \r\nAdam"

    perhaps from feedback from designers you could include some guidelines, and reasons
    for them. \r\n\r\nI find the flagging of extrema without points to be quite useful,
    just as an aid to the drawing process. When you click on 'correct' it will hit
    exactly the extremum, which is useful.  "

    body: "I have a need for high precision as well so I had an email exchange with
      FontLab about this issue a couple of weeks ago after noticing the FogLamp manual
      had specific information about the UPM that was missing from the FontLab Studio
      manual. The reply:\r\n\r\n\"FogLamp manual does say that OpenType TT fonts can
      have a UPM of up to 16,000 although FontLab Studio only supports 10,000. That's
      true for OT PS as well. FontLab theoretically supports 10,000 but according
      to Yuri Yarmola (our chief programmer) it is not recommended to set UPM to more
      than 4,000. This may cause value overflow problems with certain math operations
      in FontLab.\"\r\n\r\nIn a followup email he also said that FontLab would consider
      enabling support for 10,000 UPM if I could prove I really needed it. I don't
      have a need for it and I feel certain that applies to 99% of us.\r\n\r\nFor
      text fonts, a maximum 4,000 UPM will work just fine -- attaining high precision
      is easy to do. So I am happy with the 4,000 number.\r\n\r\nIt also helps to
      know that when generating a font, FontLab Studio retains the precision in the
      finished font of whatever UPM you digitized to, unlike Fontographer which rounds
      down to 1,000 UPM at generation time even in the most current version from FontLab.\r\n\r\n"

    what Yuri says about the tool, is that we don't have the TT maximum to plot the
    EM on (16,384 is, I believe, the actual number), and that 4000, though hopefully
    he means 4096 is safe. \r\n\r\nNick, as seen in Lucas's 1000-x problem, to me,
    1000 is nearly 1/2 way to correct for print, mostly because of the details required
    for some faces for that medium. There is nothing stopping one from defining the
    black-compressed at 2048 when the rest of a family is at 1000.\r\n\r\nThe best
    news of the day, is that you can open fonts in foglamp, amp-em-up to 16k, output
    a new font and make them FL proof, true?\r\n\r\n"

    only the Adobe Arabic fonts have a UPM of 2048, the Hebrew and Thai have UPMs
    of 1000. My approach is to tailor the UPM to the design. If I can accurately represent
    a design using a UPM of 1000, I will do so because there will be fewer point coordinates
    with four digit values and hence the size of the font file will be smaller. In
    the case of the Adobe Arabic, the designer Tim Holloway felt that he needed that
    larger UPM size to achieve the refinement he wanted, and since he is used to thinking
    in a 2048 em, having now worked on a number of fonts with that UPM, we settled
    on that.\r\n\r\nIn another project I am working on, I'm using a UPM of 4096, because
    that's what I feel is necessary to accurately represent the complexity of the
    design.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about TT/OT with regard to the em square is that
    it does allow this flexibility, and means that the design does not need to be
    forced into a standard grid. Unfortunately, some font companies have settled on
    a standard em square, usually 1000, and although this makes sense in terms of
    converting existing PS Type 1 font data, it seems to me an unnecessary and unwelcome
    restriction to apply to new designs."
