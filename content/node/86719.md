  tend to think that all-caps fonts, like Trajan, are best used without case changes,
  i.e. sticking to the upper case height. I know the opposite has become common practice,
  but I would attribute this to a certain lack of information and maybe even a lack
  of feel for the monumental, sigillary character of these designs (I am really having
  Trajan in mind, or similar designs). If I get the idea right, these fonts are not
  meant for prolonged reading, but for a short text that stays stamped on your forehead
  for ever, sort of... \r\n\r\nOn the above grounds, I would go for 2 or 3 in the
  attached sample (part of a project under way). Please disregard the second line,
  as my query only relates to the top Trajan line. This text will be at the centre
  and top of a website, all its subpages etc. \r\n\r\nComments, suggestions, chidings
  and admonishments are gratefully welcome.\r\nJuan\r\n"

    in the font. I don\u2019t know if Optical metrics is to blame, or if you\u2019ve
    manually fiddled with it, but the spacing on this title is a bit uneven. The natural
    fitting that Twombly built into the fonts is much more balanced in general."

  body: "Thank you both. \r\n@kentlew: I confess to having manually fiddled with the
    kerning. I try to be a little wary of inbuilt kerning, and to try manual adjustments
    when it comes to this kind of stuff (following Tschichold's advice), but I'm very
    grateful for your comment. I'll try to come closer as natural as possible. Still,
    wouldn't you think that this font's natural HE pair (for instance) is a bit too
    open?"

    limitation of TH. \r\n\r\nIn your case, the TH pairs you have are always going
    to be open \u2014 that\u2019s the nature of T. So everything else should be balanced
    against that visual space. \r\n\r\nAlso, Trajan has a very open O; there\u2019s
    nothing you can do about that large counter. So, between the forced spaces of
    T and O, your HESON ends up looking unnaturally tight (at least to my eyes) and
    you\u2019ve isolated and exacerbated the spaces under T and inside O.\r\n\r\nLook
    at your primary word MATHESON \u2014 the MATH will always be open because of angular
    M and A and wide T. Next to these HES is too tight. SO and ON are also too tight
    for that O.\r\n\r\nI suppose one could try to make an argument for a 1970s-style
    tight-but-not-touching setting, but that goes completely against the nature of
    Trajan and against the kind of majesty I think you\u2019re trying to project with
    this title."

  body: "@Kent: really grateful for your explanation. And we take our vision for granted!
    I shall have a slow new look at this case and in general to caps kerning. Gracias.\r\n\r\n@Nick:
    we may have to stick to typographic Eurocentrism, alas, since we are in Londinium,
    publishing in English, within Western academic standards, travelling on the Tube...but
    seriously now, what would be an alternative? I would think for most people, who
    are unaware of Trajan's imperial associations, it is simply a beautiful font,
    or simply the same font on the film posters. They are used to it. What would be
    a less Eurocentric font using the Latin alphabet? I think I see your point, but
    I can't think of an alternative... may I have a hint?"
