body: "I want to publish a typeface I'm working on (which I hope will form part of
  a small family) and need to include a license. I've been trying to find an appropriate
  free license, along the lines of the GPL/copyleft which might cover any nasties/abuses
  happening later.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that there are issues with GPL licenses in fonts.
  (See here: http://www.typophile.com/node/31738) So it needn't be a GPL license.
  I just can't find an appropriate, simple license text specific to font distribution.\r\n\r\nEssentially
  it needs to cover my free distribution, future free distribution (license intact)
  and my copyright.\r\n\r\nAnyone with a similar license they use?"

    Perens]] in his blog article [[http://perens.com/blog/2009/02/17/64/|Warning:
    SIL Open Font License]] has expressed some concern about SIL's [[http://scripts.sil.org/OFL|Open
    Font License]] claiming: <em>\"There appears to be an unintended loophole that
    would allow the conversion of any font under the license to public domain.\"</em>
    \r\n\r\n* There is a \"[[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#FontException|Font
    Exception]]\" which can be tagged onto the end of the [[http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html|GPL]]
    to make it suitable for fonts ~ however the author of that subsequently wrote
    an article on [[http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/20050425novalis|Font Licensing
    and the GPL]] in which he expressed some reservations. \r\n\r\n- Chris "
