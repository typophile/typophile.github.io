  and have been looking for a really swashy font, lots of lovely elegant curls and
  swirls ... does one exist? I thought if anyone knows, you lot do. The store sells
  anything from a luxury car to a massive diamond ... the store for those nouveau
  riche people that have got it all but want more (and can afford it!).\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions welcomed!"
