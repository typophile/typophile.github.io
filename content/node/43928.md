    As the built-in Typophile search still is useless, better make yourself a browser
    bookmark with the following as the address:\r\n<code>javascript:void(q=prompt('Search%20Typophile:',''));if(q)void(location.href='http://www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com'+'%20'+escape(q))</code>\r\nKudos
    to <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/user/1011\">Grant Hutchinson</a>!\r\nIn
    case you don\u2019t like Google, feel free to replace its URL with that of a competitor
    \u2026\r\n\r\n2. Tools like <a href=\"http://www.smileonmymac.com/textexpander/\">TextExpander</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/\">Typinator</a> make it
    dead easy to quickly insert hyperlinks."
