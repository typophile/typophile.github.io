body: "I am currently working on a booklet on the decay of the city I live in. More
  to the point I am trying to catalogue and reference all the commercial spaces that
  are currently vacant and trying to establish statistics on types of commerces most
  likely to fail and where they will.\r\n\r\nIt's all very unscientific right now
  but in the upcoming weeks I will be discussing this with various local historians.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  city in itself has a big industrial past that is now dead. It's the city of Mulhouse
  in France and if I didn't know any better I'd compare it to a city affected by the
  rust belt syndrome.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this lenghty but necessary introduction, I
  am now stumbling on a typeface selection. I am utterly clueless about french typography
  especially anything related to this city in particular ( they used to make textile
  here ... books aren't a big thing in the history of this city ).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nI
  wanted to use Francesco - Franck Jalleau [[http://www.culturesfrance.com/adpf-publi/folio/lettres/a034.html]]\r\nbut
  it isn't commercially available.\r\n\r\n"

    at small point size is also fairly good which is essential for my usage."
