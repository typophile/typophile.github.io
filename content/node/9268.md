  body: It&#39;s not a book, just an article from Eye magazine no. 40, 2001. <BR>
    <BR>The article is entitled &#34;Digital Type Decade&#34;, written by Emily King.
    <BR> <BR>I found it very interesting when writing a short thesis on recent years
    typography last month. <BR> <BR>Good luck!

  body: Go to RNIB&#39;s website &#40;<a href="http://www.RNIB.co.uk" target="_blank">www.RNIB.co.uk</a>&#41;
    and have a scooby around. You can buy a pack off them that details designing for
    the visually impaired for various media including the web. It not only outlines
    suitable font styles and minimum &#40;and maximum - some people with visual impairments
    can&#39;t read text if it is to big believe it or not&#41; sizes but also points
    out colour combinations required to assist people with various types of colour
    blindness and visual impairities. If you want visual clarity you can&#39;t find
    a better test group than the visually impaired - if they can see it people with
    20/20 vision should have a much easier time of it to.  <BR> <BR>
