body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI did something unintentionally, while I was sorting my glyphs,
  anyway - my tools are all grey/translucent now and I can't change a single thing.
  \"erase tool\" is grey, \"knife tool\" is grey, \"elipse\" - everything. I basically
  can't select any of the tools, nor a single dot when I open glyph window and I don't
  know how to undo what I just did. I quit and restart, but the problem remains.\r\nI
  attached a snapshot.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help! "

    will appear. There are many boxes one can show, snap or LOCK! E.g. all layers,
    outline, guidelines, hints, masks, etc\u2026 UNCHECK \"LOCK OUTLINE\" THE 3RD
    BOX IN THE 2ND ROW, unless you really for some reason want to disable ALL the
    EDIT TOOLS.\r\nMensch! These new computers with their supersensitive touch pads
    can make you go crazy - I totally wasn't aware I had this box checked! Anyhow
    - problem solved - by myself - comme d'habitude!"
