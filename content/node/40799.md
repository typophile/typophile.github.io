  body: "Reminds me a lot of <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=digital_kauno&page=1&nb_ppp_old=50&text=NUMBER+ONE+GUN&nb_ppp=50&psize=m&classt=alpha\">Digital
    Kauno</a>, a freeware font by Fenotype. There are quite a few similarities, but
    obviously not the same font. I searched Veer & MyFonts for 'unicase' but nothing
    even this close. It was under 'Various Script' category at Dafont.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: ya, that is very close. I have been seeing a lot of these style fonts on album
    covers lately and really like them. Thanks for digging.
