  producing woodtype using a laser engraver. I'm wondering how best to approximate
  the traditional size of the wood block surrounding each letter.\r\n\r\nI know that
  the 1000 UPM is essentially defining the vertical dimensions of the letter block,
  but, how do I determine where to place the letter vertically? That is, how do I
  determine how far above the cap-height, or ascender height, the edge of the type
  block is? Also, I am wondering if the left and right sidebearing measurements equate
  to the left and right sides of the block. At first guess, that would appear to be
  where those measurements come from, but I could be wrong and would prefer to know
  for sure.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture14_5636.png]"

  body: "Jason, \r\n\r\nin digital fonts, the body of the letter (the block) is intangible.
    It is only a scaling measure. \r\n\r\nThe linespacing is determined by the ascender
    and the descender. In many text fonts, however, the sum of ascender and descender
    equals the body size (i.e. the UPM size, i.e. the point size). In other words,
    such fonts produce 10 pt type on a 10 pt leading when set solid (with no extra
    leading). So you could use the ascender and descender lines to determine the vertical
    size of the block. However, keep in mind that diacritics or tall elements of a
    face may hang over the vertical boundaries of the body, just like the kern of
    the italic f typically hangs over the horizontal boundaries of the body. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Are you planning on using it on a letterpress? If so you need to keep in
    mind that the type height (the thickness of the block, so from the bottom of the
    block to the top surface of the letter) has to be a certain value, otherwise it
    won't print.\r\n\r\nI don't know exactly how high though (since this is sometimes
    different in other countries). Overhere it's usually measured in augustijn (=
    1 cicero = 12 <em>didot</em> points). If I'm not mistaken (it has been a long
    time since I did letterpress printing) the type height is also measured in these
    units. I believe the UK/US used Pica, which is 12 points.\r\n\r\nIn any case,
    I would just get some woodtype, and start measuring some things, like what the
    type height must be. Look how they aswered the questions you have in your post,
    too, like the vertical placement of the letters on the block."

  body: "For metal type, the position of the baseline was standardized at the end
    of the 19th century, although there was more than one standard (\"art line\" allowed
    for longer descenders than usual). Of course, this position is dependent also
    on the point size.\r\n\r\nThe amount of depth is referred to as \"type high.\"
    I read that the value is 23.3 mm, or 0.9186\". I think there may have been a competing
    standard for this in Europe, however.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Typecasting (in metal) was rather flexible in this \u2014 eg if a customer
    needed say 10 pt type and wanted to have 14 pt leading, one could order a certain
    amount of 10pt type on a 14 pt body (incorporating the leading, thus eliminating
    the need for \u2018real\u2019 leading).\r\n\r\nJust do what feels right (and take
    in account that wood has a different way of behaving \u2014 having some latitude
    is handy: you can always shave off some material).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf all of the material
    you are going to print is your woodtype, depth is not an issue. Clamp it together,
    ink and make an impression\u2026\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

    is if he wants to print it on a letterpress, since the cilinder(s) of the press
    are at a certain distance from the printing bed thing. Whatever all that stuff
    is called in English. If the type is too low, it will not touch the paper."

    head and foot space as well as sidebearings because the matrix needed to include
    a minimal amount of material or fail. But here, the matrix is digital, so I guess
    it won't?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    letterpress is not a huge concern\u2014i'm having some trouble finding someone
    who knows where/how to find the letterpress here in Cincinnati, if it still is
    sitting around somewhere. not too mention one of my studio friends recently built
    a homemade 8.5x11 wood-and-hydraulic-jack letter press\u2014so i can just use
    that. while it would be nice to print a specimen poster, i'm mostly concerned
    with the statement that will be made by presenting internet slang (i'm trying
    to do for \"lol\" what the ampersand has done for \"and\") and emoticons as physical
    type.\r\n\r\nwere it practical for the remaining 12 weeks of school i have, i
    would love to punch my own metal type\u2014just to push the statement as far as
    possible, but i don't have that kind of time."
