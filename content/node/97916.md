  of designing such, starting from latin Bauhaus characters but the Corel (limited
  edition) program that I have did not help. Does anyone know where I could find the
  fonts I look for, or would it be practical (i.e. cost effective) to have this designed
  by a professional? Would anyone in this forum be inetrested? At what price? Thank
  you."

    this done professionally is likely to cost several thousand pounds per weight/style.
    The difference between something barely workable and a professionally finished
    font is worth every penny though!"

  body: 'Well, such prices are far beyond the available budget. It seems to me that
    designing Bauhaus Greek for commercializing the font family will be well worth
    it, since the latin family is quite popular already. It looks like I will have
    to change plans about the font family to use! Just an extra note: About 22 years
    ago a graphics designer professional had designed a logo using Bauhaus Greek from
    the Letraset families. Unfortunately Letraset is no longer available!'
