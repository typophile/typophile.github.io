  to use a typeface that I can't find or identify.\r\n\r\nCan anyone identify the
  typeface in this poster's headlines?\r\n\r\nhttp://blambang.com/german_spas_poster.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  thought the \"S\" kind of reminded me of a black, ultra-condensed version of Font
  Bureau's Agency, but that's not altogether close. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n-Tim"

    by hand.

  body: "Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks for the input. :)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
    of any faces that are somewhat similar? I'm thinking of trying to build my own
    interpretation based on this poster, but it would nice to see something that's
    in the same ballpark, at least for reference/inspiration.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
