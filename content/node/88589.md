    looks a bit Arabic, as someone said above."

    Monty Python skit - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2Bs1ZZ-7b8 - so I think it's
    a little disturbing that the first thing I saw was the BBQ."

    outside of a sign could be\r\nused to draw non-Arabs in, and the inside could
    make\r\nthem feel like they've traveled to an Arab country.\r\n\r\nAlso one cool
    thing here is that the neon promotes the\r\njoining of letters, which of course
    makes it more Arabic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
