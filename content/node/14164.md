  Cyrillic alphabet is an alphabet used for several East and South Slavic languages,
  as well as many other languages of the former Soviet Union, Asia and Eastern Europe.
  With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on January 1, 2007, Cyrillic
  is now the third official alphabet of the EU.\r\n\r\n<strong>Russian Alphabet:</strong>\r\n\u0410\u0411\u0412\u0413\u0414\u0415\u0401\u0416\u0417\u0418\u0419\u041A\u041B\u041C\u041D\u041E\u041F\u0420\u0421\u0422\u0423\u0424\u0425\u0426\u0427\u0428\u0429\u042A\u042B\u042C\u042D\u042E\u042F\r\n\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0433\u0434\u0435\u0451\u0436\u0437\u0438\u0439\u043A\u043B\u043C\u043D\u043E\u043F\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0444\u0445\u0446\u0447\u0448\u0449\u044A\u044B\u044C\u044D\u044E\u044F\r\n\r\n<strong>History:</strong>\r\nThe
  [[early Cyrillic]] alphabet, is a derivative of the [[Glagolitic]] alphabet, a ninth
  century uncial cursive usually credited to two Byzantine Greek monk brothers, [[Saint
  Cyril]] and [[Saint Methodius]]. Both of these writing systems were originally developed
  in order to preserve texts in Old Slavic (also Old Bulgarian or Old Church Slavonic).\r\n\r\nAlthough
  it is widely accepted that the [[Glagolitic]] alphabet was invented by Saints Cyril
  and Methodius, the origins of the early Cyrillic alphabet are still a source of
  much controversy. Though it is usually attributed to [[Saint Clement of Ohrid]],
  disciple of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius from Bulgarian Macedonia, the alphabet
  is more likely to have developed at the Preslav Literary School in northeastern
  [[Bulgaria]], where the oldest Cyrillic inscriptions have been found, dating back
  to the 940s. This theory is supported by the fact that the Cyrillic alphabet almost
  completely replaced the Glagolitic in northeastern Bulgaria as early as the end
  of the tenth century, whereas the Ohrid Literary School\u2014where Saint Clement
  worked\u2014continued to use the Glagolitic until the twelfth century. Of course,
  as the disciples of St. Cyril and Methodius spread throughout the First Bulgarian
  Empire, it is likely that these two main scholarly centres were a part of a single
  tradition.\r\n\r\nAmong the reasons for the replacement of the Glagolithic with
  the Cyrillic alphabet is the greater simplicity and ease of use of the latter and
  its closeness with the Greek alphabet, which had been well known in the First Bulgarian
  Empire.\r\n\r\nThere are also other theories regarding the origins of the Cyrillic
  alphabet, namely that the alphabet was created by Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius
  themselves, or that it preceded the Glagolitic alphabet, representing a \"transitional\"
  stage between Greek and Glagolitic cursive, but these have been disproved. Although
  Cyril is almost certainly not the author of the Cyrillic alphabet, his contributions
  to the Glagolitic and hence to the Cyrillic alphabet are still recognised, as the
  latter is named after him.\r\n\r\nThe alphabet was disseminated along with the Old
  Church Slavonic liturgical language, and the alphabet used for modern Church Slavonic
  language in Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic rites still resembles early Cyrillic.
  However, over the following ten centuries, the Cyrillic alphabet adapted to changes
  in spoken language, developed regional variations to suit the features of national
  languages, and was subjected to academic reforms and political decrees. Today, dozens
  of languages in Eastern Europe and Asia are written in the Cyrillic alphabet...<a
