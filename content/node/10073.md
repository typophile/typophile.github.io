  body: Brent you fall into the same problem a lot of designers have, there is no
    reason everything has to be justified to look good. interactive/dvds doesn&#39;t
    need to be letterspaced, it actually looks like a mistake because the i is hanging
    &#40;visually&#41; to the left &#40;justifing with the L serif&#41; and the s
    is hanging to the right &#40;justifing with the crossbar of the T&#41;. The graphic
    doesn&#39;t read, it could be a pizza. If you feel you really need a graphic make
    a drawing that the average consumer could recognize. This is not a logo for designers.  Now
    the word LOCKHART needs a lot of work on the letterspacing. Establish the spacing
    on the biggest problem the LO, its currently floating, then work on the color
    of the spacing on the other letters. Good start, look forward to revisions. One
    last thought loose the color when working on a logo. Make it work in black and
    white and then look at colors.

  body: My tip...open up the Yellow pages, go to CD-ROM duplication. Look at all the
    logos. Consider those all examples of what &#42;not&#42; to do. ;o&#41;

  body: I think you maybe should loose, or at least rethink, the stretched &#39;CD&#39;,
    or &#39;<a href="http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/_data/objects/10446/logo_thumbnail.gif"
    target="_blank">DVD</a>&#39;, icon / symbol.. <BR>It may look &#39;cheesy&#39;,
    but what about playing a bit more with the &#39;O&#39; in &#39;LOCKHART&#39; to
    get a subtle &#39;DVD&#39; connection&#39;..

    will read &#40;interactive dvds&#41;.

  body: If you want to avoid &#39;Interactive | DVDs&#39; being read as &#39;Interactive
    DVDs&#39;, why not just transpose them? <BR> <BR>The latest logo is much better,
    but the curves feel a little awkward, or maybe just too wavy and not crisp, clean,
    and geometric enough. The silhouette of the disc feels more like propellers now.
    Perhaps the connection from the &#39;O&#39; to the curves should be a straight
    rule &#40;thinner than the type strokes&#41;?
