body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nHope someone can help with this one\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/electrical-services_5933.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
  tricky as the sample attached looks like its been stretched or it's compressed italic?\r\n\r\nI've
  tried the 'what the font' search and it couldn't get anything close prossibly due
  to the stretching. I've got Baker Signet, and Cestestia but they're still a way
  off.\r\n\r\nIt's one of those fonts I'm sure I know (at least I think I do!) - but
  I'm struggling and need some expert help!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\n\r\nBrian"
