    very imprecise these days, considering\r\nrendering differences between Windows
    and MacOS).\r\n\r\nBut if you mean screen fonts (which can actually be deployed\r\nwithout
    necessarily being present on the host system) then for\r\nsans I would alert you
    to my Mana fonts, which come in 16, 13\r\nand 11 PPEM (each in regular and bold).
    Here's a sample setting\r\nof the two smaller sizes:\r\n(149Kb) http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Mana13&11.gif\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's a head-to-head comparison:\r\n(197Kb) http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/ManaCompar.jpg\r\n\r\nFor
    a serif face, to me Georgia is unmatched... for now.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    they likely went for a the antialiasing algorithms that worked best for Lucida.
    So the answer would be \u201Cdepends\u201D. \r\n "

  body: Hrant, do you have anything wider than Mana? I find it to condensed for easy
    reading. It looks good in the navigation example contra antialiased Tahoma, but
    in the text comparison with Verdana I find the latter easier to read, even though
    the actual rendering of many of the individual letters in Mana is better than
    the b/w Verdana bitmaps. I'm sure this is due almost entirely to the narrowness
    of Mana.

  body: "I agree that it's a bit too narrow for optimal reading.\r\nAlthough the difference
    between this and one more bit\r\nof width isn't minor! In fact one more bit might
    make it\r\nnon-optimal on the other side - at least at those PPEMs.\r\nFor example
    a 14 PPEM bitmap font at the widths of the\r\nMana-16 might be right on the mark.\r\n\r\nMy
    reasons for making Mana like this are that:\r\n1) It's a sans, so non-optimal
    for reading anyway. I have a serif in the works that's wider. But, as above, part
    of the reason it looks wider is that the x-height is one bit shorter (and so are
    the descenders).\r\n2) Since it's a screen font, being able to fit in narrow spaces
    is a big plus, and this makes Mana more versatile.\r\n3) It helps it stand out
    from the crowd, including Verdana.\r\n4) Making it wider would cause the interal
    white to start overpowering the interletter spacing, especially in the lighter
    weights, which also have smaller x-heights (and especially for a sans). The \"integerness\"
    of everything in a bitmap font (including here the interletter spacing) tends
    to propagate issues throughout the design. It's like the various \"integernesses\"
    :-) are in a multi-way tug-of-war, and you have to make sure nothing falls in
    the mud.\r\n\r\nBut really, I actually find Mana more readable than Verdana on
    that page, probably because: the grays hold the letters (and boumas?) together
    better; and it's one bit taller, making it of comparable apparent size, something
    even more important onscreen than in print.\r\n\r\nBut if there's enough demand
    (read: $) for a wider sans,\r\nthen I'd love to make it - in bitmap font design
    that sort\r\nof change isn't too hard. The hard part is sizing.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
