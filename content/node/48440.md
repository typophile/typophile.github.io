  to set some type in InDesign CS2 and the letter spacing is atrocious (esp the lowercase
  \"e\").  I am using Bernhard Gothic SG Heavy at 24pt.\r\n\r\nI am not having this
  problem with any other weight.  Of course, I know how to fix this manually, but
  does anyone else have this problem?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture1_6407.jpg]"

  body: "I have it set for metrics, but optical is even worse.  Optical makes all
    the characters unevenly spaced.  It looks really strange.\r\n\r\nJust fyi, all
    the options are on default (as in \"0\")."

    never heard of Spiece Graphics before (but that doesn\u2019t mean a thing). I
    only know the URW version; no spacing problems with that one:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BernhardGothicURWHeavy_3830.png]\r\nF"

  body: "I am at work, so the font I am using predates my employment.  However, I
    am going to take it home and see if it does the same thing there.  Unfortunately,
    I only have CS2 at work, but I have CS3 at home.\r\n\r\nFlorian, that WHOLE line
    looks better in the URW version.  It's hard to see with what I posted, but the
    glyphs also appear to jump up and down along the baseline.  Only the heavy though.
    \ Now that I'm comparing them, they look much different.  Esp the x-height.\r\n\r\nIf
    I have the same problems at home, I'll definitely write an email to SG."

  body: "Florian, I should have elaborated, but yes, I know it's a different font.
    \ Moreover, I meant I think it is better than the version I have.\r\n\r\nI tried
    it at home, and although it is better, its still not great.  Since this is the
    font the client wants, I think I am going to see if we can purchase the URW version.
    \ \r\n\r\nTop is optical, below is metrics.  Still not great, although an improvement
    in CS3."
