		<div class="commentbody">Congrats Claus et al. Some quite interesting ideas in the mix, I find myself really drawn to the texture and atmosphere of Gro's and Crystian's typefaces, great job guys! Nice that you guys are posting the Reflections of Practice nows, give a nice insight into the process.

Thanks again for hosting us when we visited Reading.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd be inclined to agree there is a certain Reading-ness in several of these, and in previous years. But without the designers directly requesting comments themselves I thought it may be a bit presumptuous and/or pretentious to offer criticism. 

What I love is the enthusiasm of all the students, which really shines through in both the specimens and the RoPs. It makes me even more interested in the process of type design and the underlying thinking. Thanks for sharing these.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm personally very much enamored of Coline. It carries the torch, I think, of the emerging aesthetic embodied in faces like Skolar, or Freight Micro, or the sketches of Kompilat that were kicking around here a year or two ago. 

Actually, insofar as a number of the faces this year seem to tap into that feel at various levels, I'd say there is a kind of cohesive school to the output of...um...the Reading school. I think that's a great thing, though. It all *feels* very contemporary and of the zeitgeist to me. 

I'll leave it to the better-informed and -read to offer less subjective insight. I'm sticking to unqualified admiration. Again, congrats. </div>

I tend to agree that not only Reading but design schools in general tend to graduate students with portfolios with a certain sameness. Perhaps I might say that the prevalent look of Reading work is towards chunky text faces. Having said this, I don't find that this requires admonishment.  We have to remember that this is a school whose job it is to produce competent students, not so much for the student work to be highly original. We have to remember that this is student work examined and discussed regularly by faculty and fellow students. This methodology would by its nature bring a certain amount of sameness to the classwork and final projects.

A better question is, how good or original (if that is your criteria) is the work of the graduates a few years after completing Reading? We have to give each graduate time to blossom out of their student chrysalis and spread their own professional wings.

		<div class="commentbody">Also keep in mind most of us in Reading (with the exception of Anette this year) have been working in the rather narrow field of <i>text</i> typefaces. Me? I was aware of this Reading house-style you seem to allude to but I don’t think it stems from our professors at all, it has more to do with the fact that most students go to Reading without ever having designed a complete typeface – which is the whole point of the course. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like everything about Reading students, but what I don't like about them is the ignorance they pay to their non-Latin designs, specially to the Indics. They never seem to do it properly. All their typefaces I have seen so far looks alike and has a typical Fiona Ross style in them. Nice smooth curves, but lack of a balanced skeleton.

Also, they never care to set a single line without making mistakes in their specimens. I understand it to a certain extent as they can't read the script, but then they can always get it proof read, if they care at all. They will use some random text with thousands of mistakes in it and overall it will make no sense. Remember, text is meant to be read, even if it's a dummy text. And it says the best about a typeface when it's set in a proper text.

I am not pointing towards any individual here, but a personal reflection to the course as whole. Never mind. :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I want to remind folks that the specimens you see from recent or soon to be graduates at MATD -Reading, KABK, or any other type design MA program are works in progress. They show engagement, process and thinking. They are not products. The specimens are made under significant time pressure and often include some errors of grammar setting etc. If they can sometimes be mistaken for products - that is really a statement in their favor. A kind of happy accident or proof of being exceptional. The reality is, obvious or no, is that all these projects will need more time to become polished and refined tested etc before they can be released.

Also I actually disagree about the type looking alike this year. I think there is an amazing amount of diversity of style on the more obvious aesthetic level and of approach if you take the time to look more deeply. I think that it is great that students' strange experiments can be made bubble under the surface rather than jumping out at you. 

Christopher, read the eco font site more carefully. You have not noticed that you are supposedly forbidden from talking that idea and using it. I don't think they can enforce that but... But more importantly that post is off topic. Start a new thread or further one that is about that topic.

Farquart Qimbosole, what is your real name? I have seen your registration and it looks made up to me.

I have to confess for anybody who doesn't already know it that I am both a MATD student and a Moderator. No doubt this colors my view to a significant extent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Randy. I did write to Alejandro Lo Celso about Enquire and I am waiting for his feedback on it: we are definitely thinking along the same lines by following Roger Excoffon and Evert Bloemsma’s footsteps, and I hope my Enquire and his Quimera / Garonne can be seen as complementary designs (also not on the same level: I am but a student here). And while saying “yes, it was a lot of work” would probably sound like I did all the work myself without any guidance – which isn’t the case – and self-condescending or worse, disrespectful towards my fellow classmates who worked at least as hard as I did, I can certainly claim it was a lot of fun!

Splendid work to you and your cohorts. 

<cite>Thank you everybody. Do continue to let the comments roll in, it’s very interesting to hear what the outside world thinks.
</cite>

I can gladly throw in the opinion of a complete laymen in typography and an aspiring graphic designer. ;) You'll have to work with me: my type lexicon is still in its infancy.

<cite>Personally</cite> speaking, I am particularly turned off by Capoeira, You Are Here, and Guillotine. ( I would say Okapi and Cantarell, as well, but I can tell that those two are designed uniquely to different categorical standards. This is a thought that I have that I cannot explain well, but just feel).

Anyhoo, in particular, I do not like these fonts because it feels as though they are moving, like they are fluid or dynamic. I particularly am found of type that is eternal and static. But type that has this motion feel feels very novel—maybe even child-like—and it seems to lack the necessary rigid elegance and eternity that a "professional" font would otherwise have. I was first made aware of this when I laid eyes on MS's Candara ( http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=295 ) . 

I think I was raised in a time where the general public were exposed to sans serif typefaces that were a clean mix of thick lines and thicker lines—no nonsense. Now, it seems as though more and more type has this bulging, expanding, and subtle curvatures. It's very different from the ubiquitous—and comforting—presence of typefaces like Futura and Helvetica.

But that's just my rambling!

Nice job. :) 

PS How do you pronounce your last name? I have always found the word Søren to be overwhelmingly beautiful. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">To state the obvious, all Latin typefaces to a greater or lesser degree look similar due to the fact that they are all based on the same skeletal forms. If you are to investigate similarities (totally valid) what is it that you find similar and then is this similarity a good or bad thing - is it correct or incorrect, is it useful or a hindrance?

These fonts are not being designed in a vacuum. (I am of last years cohort) you do have the attention of your classmates and of the tutors of which access at variable frequencies (not every day). Also time factors into the design process. After a short time of experimentation, the thing (typeface) needs to become *real* and so perhaps similar processes are used here as 'proof of concept' that everyone *can * create a typeface.

I am interested in the comment about the stability of a typeface and if the character stands firm or throws weight onto the next character. NICE.

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Satya,

I cannot not react on some of your comments as I find them rather vague and some of them simply not valid. Please, excuse the length.

Can you please describe what is the Fiona Ross’s style in more detail? As far as I am concerned Fiona never attempted to influence my style while I was designing my Gujarati. In fact she is extremely cautious about that. Her teaching method is style-independent I would say. Therefore, to me, and I believe to most of the people who did any Indian script with Fiona, this must sound like a ready-made opinion. It is not based on any evidence. There is a significant stylistic difference between Surat, Vesper, and Martel/Malabar for example. How can you not see that? It is three different styles and you refer to all of them as Ross’s style?

Or is the balanced skeleton part of what you refer to as a style?

Little note about the ignorance. Personally, I did (and every student is encouraged to do so) a significant research of Gujarati typography. I might be an ignorant, but I am not aware of studies of similar scale (about the same amount as Emma Williams’ work on Gurmukhi and other works on non-Latins) in Gujarati. The students' strive to understand the writing system and its conventions is immense. How could you possibly call such a research-based approach an ignorance?

Also, please refer to Indian (or Indic if you wish) scripts only, not to non-Latins. Are you experienced in judging/designing Arabic, Ethiopian, Cyrillic, … As far as I understood, you are Hindi with some understanding of Gujarati. Correct me if I am wrong. In what respect you are entitled to judge the other Indian scripts more than the students? Have you done research of similar scale for all of the scripts?

Last time I did ask you about my Gujarati and you did not have any comments (besides typos which is purely linguistic comment). I would very much appreciate some, once I am working on it again.

> I am not pointing towards any individual here, but a personal reflection to the course as whole. Never mind. :D

It would have been better if you did point towards individuals, because as a reflection on the course it is simply not true as I attempted to explain above. And the reasoning is completely independent on readers’ understanding of Indian scripts. Hence anybody can make their own picture.

I am not going to elaborate much on the misspellings as I would just repeat Eben's words. The limited time and focus on typeface design instead of language are the main reasons for such mistakes. My Surat specimen is full of them and nobody so far intepreted it as a typographic ignorance. Of course it would be much nicer to have it without them and much more respectable to the language, but it has nothing to do with typeface design. It is almost certain, that I left many typos in this text, but I believe the readers will get the meaning despite my language deficiencies.

		<div class="commentbody">I really see it as a privilege to have someone like Fiona as a teacher for designing non-Latin typefaces.

In my eyes, Fiona is one of the few type designers with a trained and experienced eye in non-Latin typeface design who is able to guide students (and professionals) along the path of designing a non-Latin font. During the entire process your she puts the emphasis on experimenting with different calligraphic styles, understanding the various typesetting systems, achieving a good execution of the glyphs, taking advantage of the possibilities of contemporary font technologies and undertaking sound research in order to achieve contemporary fonts of high quality. She does not advocate a 'house-style' but encourages each of us to find our own voice and design methodology.

Since 1978 she collaborated in designing typefaces for many non-Latin scripts (first for Linotype and later for Adobe), and I believe that the millions of international readers (and compagnies) that read the newspapers and magazines for which she (and her team) designed the non-Latin typefaces never complained about any unbalanced skeleton in her designs. On the contrary, I believe that her typeface designs just include a balanced skeleton, that's one of the aspects which makes them good textfaces for setting long paragraphs. And this is probably also the reason why so many clones (not to say rip-offs) of her non-Latin typefaces are out there. (Also, see: http://www.typojo.com/pages/kolkata.html)

Regarding the MA students, do not forget that they worked on their designs for period of  'only' 10 months, which does not make one a professional designers just yet. Should one not be glad that more people are trying to produce well-researched, good quality fonts for scripts where there is not enough variety? I have had excellent feedback from the Tibetan community on my font (also, designed under Fiona's supervision). 

- btw Satya, I recall that you spent an entire afternoon in the department with Fiona and me and John Hudson showing you (and Fabio) the Linotype Non-Latin collection. You did not show any indication then that you considered the typefaces poorly designed.

Jo

		<div class="commentbody">I have no much to add apart from admiting here publicly too that I agree with my fellow colleagues Jo and David. 

Having Fiona Ross as a teacher and advisor has taught me loads--she was crucial to put me in the right way in both my practical and theoretical parts of the course, not for imposing me how to  draw specific nodes and curves. Your comments sound a bit offensive and denote you seem to be unaware of what's going on there, Satya.

BTW, it is valid to say here too that the Tamil typeface I created was also generally well received by a number of tamilians, including people from literary and graphic design areas.

I also disagree that there is a 'Reading house style' going on. The last three year's work do show the repetition of some design decisions such as broken curves or assymetric serifs, but I strongly believe there is some sort of differentiation and also many other ideas going on. Nobody is imposing any style there.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with satya, the English fonts look good, the Indics; with all due respect are pathetic. Linguistically, they have not even written a single line correctly. The letters are not balanced at all, some of them seem to have been written in the wrong (sequence)way. The Tamil is quite ungainly, it would have helped them a lot if they could have atleast learned the language or shown it to some Tamil font designers (who have a greater sensitivity than Tamil natives). It is one thing to look at a font as a novelty, completely another to use it everyday in every context, plus a comparative with exiting fonts by natives would somewhere suggest which one is more aesthetically pleasing.

Fiona Ross is a wonderful researcher, but I think she is famous as a type designer only in the west. In India I'm not so sure as to how many people use fonts designed by her. I think most of Fionas' fonts were designed and used in the pre-digital era because linotype had a monopoly on printing machines, in the digital age this monopoly was broken and a lot of local designers have made some very nice fonts which are in popularly being used. I feel westerners are not exposed (or do not acknowledge) Indian type designers/researchers.

Finally I'd say good work on the Latins, but I think you have a long way to go for the Indics, the first step I guess is learning the language.

		<div class="commentbody">Well guys, as Fernando says we do a lot of research on non-latin issues at Reading and Fiona is a very important link to non-latin for the students. Qualifying the typefaces as "pathetic" is very harsh exageration. I do not know much about Indic typefaces, but what I do know is that Fiona is honest in her work and has many many years experience, which deserves a bit of respect.  

Let's remember that the MA typefaces are part of a learning process, latin or non-latin, we all work on them to get knowledge out of that experience, after that I think all of the students who have released their typefaces have re-worked them a lot after the MA.

Linotype Bengali -- or the numerous unauthorised clones of it -- is the most widely used Bengali text type in both Assam and Bangladesh. The importance of this design, by Fiona Ross and Tim Holloway, was acknowledged in the recent exhibition of Bengali typographic history in Kolkata, to which Fiona was invited as guest of honour. To suggest that Fiona's work is not used in India is simply ridiculous.</div>

I myself have been working on some fonts for a while, I must I am as harsh on myself as I am on others hence have not been able to release/display any of my fonts. Same is the case with my friends.

Fermello, please have a look at the fonts designed by students of NID, IDC, & JJ school of Art. I'm not sure if they've put up their work, but I saw their graduate show, and was quite happy to see some fonts designed by students. Fonts designed by CDAC, are very popular among Indian publishers, you can find their catalog online.

		<div class="commentbody">Vikas: <em>I have friends both in NID and IDC, I’ve seen them work on a font for years. I myself have been working on some fonts for a while, I must I am as harsh on myself as I am on others hence have not been able to release/display any of my fonts.</em>

Similarly, it should be noted, very few of the Reading MA student typefaces are ever released (either the Latin or the non-Latin): they are student projects intended to develop and demonstrate certain skills, not to produce a releasable typeface. Some of the students go on to complete/extend and release their student projects after they graduate, usually with much revision such that the final versions are noticeably different from those shown in their student specimens (which are, by the way, one of the course deliverables; i.e. they're making the specimens because it is a requirement of the MA programme).

Most of the Indic and other non-European designs produced by Reading students, so far as I can tell, tend to be unfinished. So some of the errors in the specimen text may be due to incomplete glyph sets or only partial OpenType Layout. Again, the goal is not to produce a font ready for commercial release, but to develop and demonstrate specific skills. As someone who has hired graduates of the Reading programme, I can say that I'm interested in what the designs tell me about the skill set of the student, not whether I like the typeface or consider it complete or ready for release.

I also note that most of the non-European designs tend to be pretty conservative, more so than the Latin types (a notable exception is David's Gujarati). I suppose this might be a criticism, but given how many really crap non-Latin fonts exist in which someone has tried to be novel or has tried to apply decorative elements proper to display typography to text sizes, there's a lot to be said in favour of conservatism.</div>

I'll be the first to admit that my Devanagari is not perfect or polished, and I'm sure I made some ignorant decisions along the way. But to credit the success or failure of my Devanagari to Fiona Ross would be terribly foolish. To her credit, whatever mistakes exist in my type are there because she allowed me to find my own way with the Devanagari to a large extent. Additionally, I was able to show my work to Arobind Patel, who works as a typographic design consultant in Bombay, and he gave me a generally favorable review.
Also, I went to great lengths to keep as many typos from my specimen as possible. I apologize for any that are left over. If you would like to proofread my specimen, I would be glad to make a corrected version available.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, this is becoming an unhealthier thread now. Let me clear a few things.

@David & Paul:
Please note, I am not commenting on Fiona Ross here at all. She is a great designer/teacher and I respect her for everything she has done. Also, the term non-Latin I used was to do with Indics only - sorry for not putting it clearly.

I was mainly here referring to the typos in the specimens only, and feel that it is also the part of it. Why there is no typos in Latin?

And otherwise also, I feel that the time you guys put into designing Indics is simply not enough for the amount of work you are supposed to render. Most of you guys focus only on your Latin designs and keep all your Indic secondary. May be you all do a lot of research but it does not reflect (at least) in your booklets. All the typefaces I have seen so far, only the Latin ones were completed. Also you will always make your Latin first and then force the Indics to go with it. Is that the correct way? If the intension is to learn, why not design a stand alone typeface? 

I still stay on my opinion that the tyepfaces I have seen so far (except Malabar Hindi and Frida Tamil), lack a proper skeleton and hence not pleasing to read. No matter how refined they are.

Paul, I am not generalizing here anything, it's just a personal opinion. It all could be wrong.


Peace.

This is clearly not the case. The process is iterative and the design of Latin and other scripts is intertwined. The dominance differs for each project. Satya, do some reading before you claim something. Look at the RoPs at least. You are suggesting how the students work without knowing anything about it.</div>

The similarity I am seeing (I'm too ill equipped to even describe it) is quite nuanced, house style was too strong a term! I was curious about it's presence without intending any judgement. I thought about one day studying in Reading and was hoping to glean something about the mechanics of the course by studying the output! So for example duration sounds like a big factor.

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry folks to continue the off-topic on Tamil. 

Vikas:
<cite>
>Fermello, please have a look at the fonts designed by students of NID, IDC, & JJ school of Art. I’m not sure if they’ve put up their work, but I saw their graduate show, and was quite happy to see some fonts designed by students. Fonts designed by CDAC, are very popular among Indian publishers, you can find their catalog online.</cite>

Couldn't find the student fonts you mentioned. 

But I did find the fonts [[http://www.cdac.in/html/gist/down/type/tamil.pdf|'designed by CDAC']] and can tell you that great part of them consist of digitizations of pre-digital display types that can be found in many old metal/hotmetal catalogues from Indian foundries which I had the chance to consult while studying in Reading. Also, note that the high-contrasted fonts TM Bharati and TM Kapilan, which I reckon, must be widely used for texts, are in fact 'undercovered' Monotype designs (some of them also appeared in several pre-digital Indian catalogues, sometimes with references to the numbers 280, 340, 580 and 708, notably the Monotype way of naming its Tamil fonts). And these Monotype designs are undoubtedly derived from the work of the American Mission Press in Madras in the nineteenth century.

nor was i trying to say the 2 fonts are identical but they do share some qualities, maybe most profoundly an indescribable feeling they leave me with; of course you do not have to agree.

		<div class="commentbody">i agree with some of the comments about threads of similarities among classes. if you choose to look at these as examples of progress and learning, that's not a terrible thing as they are clearly all well-researched. but i notice the argument of "if you look more deeply into the details" is brought up a couple of times.

here's my thought on that. the perspective of a designer who would want to use these in a project is rarely one that delves quickly into the details. it begins by the initial "feel" of a typeface, the gut reaction that one wishes to apply to his material... not all designers are type freaks.

so with respect i say congratulations to the students who have put so much hard work, research, and time into such a critically challenging and otherwise difficult craft. that said, i also feel rather critical towards the lack of top-level diversity between some — not all — of the typefaces. 

that is to say... the technical, well-researched, objective qualities (that i may not fully appreciate) fall prey to the immediate subjective reaction i get when browsing a font menu or type specimen.

neverthless, impressive and badass work here!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">With Karsten's cue, I should maybe explain what I meant by that. I think that if a type works well as a text face as designers we stop looking very hard at why it is working. Similarly we don't investigate why the water works in our house. If it does, we are happy and we leave it at that. It doesn't make us bad people. But as this is a type site some of us will be wondering... So I will explain what I meant.

Without meaning to beat anybody up ( see the text above!) I think it is fair to agree with Paul Halupka and admit that graphic designers do quite often lack the skill with which to assess a text face. Not all graphic designers set books or magazines after all. Some of us make logos or do other things. So some, even many, (most?) graphic designers will not be able to quickly assess the MATD designs, or to be fair, any other group composed of text faces. I have been a member of that group.

Where I disagree with Paul Halupka is that you have to be a font freak to see the difference once you set some text in a few different type faces. Even a long time logo designer, once they try setting text will suddenly see a great deal of difference. Even if they don't know why that difference is there. 

And people who routinely make choices about setting text may not know in detail why they make their choices. But they are responding to differences in voice and weight and color. And if they are experienced they may also be making that choice based on factors like weight flexibility, glyph range, relationships betwen romans, italics, smallcaps etc. And in some cases because they know know how a type ( or formal charcateristic of a type ) acts on a given kind of paper stock when printed using a certain method.

So with that as a context; what I think is fun about this crop of MATD typefaces is that the ones which are meant to be text faces of one kind or another* work in some ways partly because formal characteristics such as tending to be relatively low contrast for instance, which in this case they mostly share, but also in spite of very different approaches to construction, levels of noise in their shapes so on. Admittedly these differences in approach are hidden under the skin of "working". But if you start to compare the letters shapes closely, or set texts in the fonts, I am confident that the difference in he fonts voice or feel and the differences in suitability to a given task will jump out at you. 

*text faces come in a variety of sub varieties after all

		<div class="commentbody">The majority of Reading student designs are low-contrast, semi-condensed, non-geometric, serifed text faces of conventional letter shape (e.g. all g's are binocular), with large x-height and ascenders that extend beyond cap height.

For differentiation from one another, they rely on styling details such as asymmetric serifs, which serve no function in a text face.

That doesn't make them dysfunctional, because they can still work very well with redundant features, although very few if any classic, established text faces have asymmetric serifs, which would suggest that it is not a good idea.

But the merit of any one face is not really the issue.
What does it say about a course in type design, that the majority of the faces hew so closely to a uniform template, year after year? 

Students should be encouraged to become aware of what is informed by both convention and trend in their shared taste (and that of the faculty) and step beyond it, experimenting with the basic parameters of type form-- x-height, extender length, and contrast (both of stem widths and letter widths), perhaps even adopt non-conventional letter forms. Is the New Typography of the previous decade dead history?

There is plenty of time to be "contemporary" once one has graduated, but surely--notwithstanding a solid grounding in technical competence--design education should be more devoted to experiment with fundamental form than styling.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Young fellow, you weren't around before. Things were turgid, to say the least.
While the Reading course is a necessary agent of maturity in digital type culture, the sameness that has been observed in its student output appears to be the result of excising the open-minded approach to type design that emerged during the digital revolution--at least if your reaction is anything to go by!

Paul, you may have arrived at your views individually, but they nonetheless have much in common with other Reading students, if such views are borne out in the faces produced.

How do you explain that Grandia has many of the same qualities of form that Reading student designs of recent years have exhibited? (noted in my 11.03 post)

		<div class="commentbody">i can't speak for others, but Grandia was influenced by (as far as i can best identify) Menhart + Dwiggins + Unger + perceived constraints for printing at small sizes + the desire to harmonize with Devanagari (highly calligraphic influence) + my own design aesthetic. I'm certain that certain other students have also been inspired to varying degrees by the first three influences at least, still others perhaps have been fascinated with type for small sizes. Had I chosen Tamil, Telugu, Sinhala or a script based on pointed pen construction for my non-Latin portion, I would probably have done a modern face for the Latin. The style I chose seemed to me to tie together all the influences/constraints that I wanted to bring together.</div>

Having once been advised by Gerry Leonidas, in a Typophile thread, that a Greek type of mine wasn't calligraphic enough, could it be that the hegemony of The Stroke at Reading comes from, first, the belief that many non-European scripts are inherently calligraphic, and consequently that multi-script types must therefore be calligraphic?</div>

Devanagari is better described as a [[abugida]] or an alphasyllabary if we're being pedantic.
My personal feelings are that any similarities that exist between the faces that come out of reading as student projects are based on the fact that many of the students likely have cultivated similar tastes to begin with and that in most every case, these projects are the first attempt of the students to produce a coherent typeface. The fact that students will be scored for their work may contribute to many students playing it on the safe side. That or perhaps young students feel that it's better to get some fundamentals down first and then experiment later. i can't say why there is such a high level of hegemony, but it is interesting to hear others speculate and criticize if a bit baffling/humorous/insightful/frustrating/humbling to hear the views of those looking from the outside in.</div>

I was paying a compliment. Candid would have been a better word to use, apologies for my cumbersome vocabulary.

Sure I'm critical of the Reading approach, because it's not the way I teach type design, and I'm interested to find out why it is what it is, by asking hard questions--hopefully in a disinterested manner. I will admit there's more than one right way to teach.

The commonalities of the student designs is a fascinating phenomenon, and your insights are quite illuminating.

But I teach a single semester course as part of a 3-year graphic design program, not a one-year MA.
A better comparison of teaching method with typeface design outcome would be comparing work designed at Reading with that done at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague (KABK), and Gerard Unger would probably be the man to do it, as he teaches at both institutions.
The KABK work appears to have more variety, although quite a few of its student designs in the most recent year are also low contrast serifed faces with very small cap height and conventional letter-forms.

Perhaps it's just the contrarian in me, but I don't see why the criterion of readability in text faces has to be such a constraining influence on proportion and letter form. Last week I came across an advertising booklet from around 1930, which I bought, in part because of the lovely text type, with its small x-height, monocular "g", and Venetian "e", which I found to be perfectly readable.

Nick, some of what you are saying doesn't quite add up for me. Admittedly I have been here at Reading and I could have "drunk the cool-aid" as they say, but even if that's the case I think some of what you wrote needs closer looking into if only for the sake of accuracy.

At first, I am not completely sure if this statement is valid at all. How many years do you include in your calculation? Did you do that calculation at all or is it just a feeling?

Second, perhaps the same can be said about contemporary text typefaces in general? So what does it say about the students’ work? That they understood the genre. The goal, for most of them, was to design a text typeface. Working text typeface. If somebody want to spend a year designing display type, that is their choice. The people usually aim bit higher, for dictionary typefaces, newspaper typefaces, … in order to make use of the academic year. So that is the reason why they chose to follow the way of "careful originality" or say "readable originality".

Third, non-geometric, low capitals, serif that is a must for a typeface usable in long texts. Large x-height, low contrast is a need for small sizes. Give me high-contrast sans-serif newspaper or dictionary typeface. The students just understand their brief.

<em>For differentiation from one another, they rely on styling details […] which serve no function in a text face.</em>

That is exactly the point! The styling has minimal function that would affect the readability. Much better option than originality for the sake of originality (venetian -e- or single-storey -g- for example). The problem is the differing understanding of what readability is. Where you go for subjective evaluation of what is and what is not readable, I would go for definition based on convention.

I would prefer if people avoided biased comparisons of the KABK and Reading. There are similar "inspiration threads" at KABK: Underware-like, Noordzij inspiration, … and at the same time there is some interesting stuff going on.

Type design is a craft at the first place. If you think you can teach being original… ehm. well, you can keep thinking that. That would be a pain to discuss it.

Neither, it's an observation.

<em>So what does it say about the students’ work? That they understood the genre.</em>

That they didn't question the conventions, or the trends.

<em>Large x-height, low contrast is a need for small sizes. </em>

For agate, perhaps, but otherwise that is simply not true. Presently, large x-height faces appear to be in vogue for text, as they were thirty years ago. Is that a need? 

<em>Where you go for subjective evaluation of what is and what is not readable, I would go for definition based on convention.</em>

It may be better, educationally, to try to achieve readability in a type design based on unconventional premises. But in my experience, when a student comes up with a set of premises for a type design, it's difficult to anticipate what the outcome will be, or what will be learnt. It may well be possible to learn more from attempting the impossible and failing dramatically. At any rate, I do not grade students by "subjectively" looking at the face and deciding how good or readable it is, or how "creative" the premise, I look at how well they have gone through the process of crafting it.

The journey is more important than the destination, and if you believe that, you will end up at the right place.

<em>If you think you can teach being original… </em>

I've never taught an MA in type design. But teaching type design to graphic design students, most of whom have no special interest in typography, they always amaze me with the variety of work they come up with.

What I was trying to say, was that Paul's analysis was very objective for someone in the middle of things.
What would be the best adjective for that? Dispassionate?

<em>...the same term is used for all these things.</em>

Well yes, English, French etc. are nationalities as well as a languages too.
For all the things that Tamil and Devanagari are, they are not inherently device-dependent (i.e. "calligraphic") in their appearance, which IMO is a mistaken view, even though their letter forms may have originated with specific media, as did the Latin script.

<em>...is it possible to see samples of the work of your students?</em>

I've already asked the authorities if this would be OK, but haven't heard back yet.

My point was bit different: from your subjective interpretation of readability arise your criteria on judging creativity/originality. Nevertheless, you made a good point in the last sentence and I agree with that. No idea why can you judge the course on the creative premise at the same time.

My impression from several remarks above is that people expect the students to come up with strikingly orginal design (as in display) while designing a text typeface. This seems mistaken. In my opinion, orginality is pretty much the oposite of readability of long texts.</div>

Agree. Having done the Reading MA in 2004-2005, and watching Robert Slimbach's processes and struggles of designing text typefaces during the past 3 years, I believe that the level of originality in what we call a readable/legible typeface can only be about 5%.

Just look back to Jenson's roman type in <em>De Evangelica Preaparatione</em> from 1470. How much have things evolved since then? What significant events happened in 500 years? Quirkiness was tamed, x-height grew, and sans serifs sprouted. Anything else? Is this comparable to the shift from blackletter to roman type? The development of sans serifs may be, assuming we don't acknowledge them as mere roman type without serifs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Originality is a very difficult topic. But I do agree with Nick that a teacher can choose to emphasize helping the student to develop his or her individual voice and vision--or not. 

And I do get the feeling that the emphasis at Reading is on producing the skills and understanding to get a job in the font industry. That they seem to be succeeding at this is an impressive achievement. 

I do get the feeling from looking at the typefaces that they don't emphasize as much development of individual voice and vision. But it is very hard to judge this from the outside, as it is also a matter of which students choose to attend, and what those students want out of the year. 

At TypeCon in Atlanta Gerry Leonides did say that he wants the students at Reading to do text faces, as these have additional demands that display faces don't. This seems to me a pretty reasonable point. 

I agree it is harder to be original with text faces, but I don't agree that originality is impossible or unimportant. You have a narrower scope to express originality, but it can come out strongly still, if the designer has a strong and consistent enough vision. Just look at Goudy Old Style or Palatino. These are unmistakable, original text faces, even though they may vary less than 5% from the faces of Jenson and Griffo. </div>

My take on this is that every writing system is tool-influenced and insofar as these tools influence the development of the normative shapes of writing during the maturation and standardisation of the script, then they more or less limit the kind of modifications that can be made without undermining those shapes in ways that may affect both legibility and cultural acceptance of new designs. Of course, other factors apply in the latter regard, not least the relative adventurousness or conservatism of the individual culture. But the influence of tools and how those tools are used can't be ignored willy-nilly. As I've written elsewhere, I think the term ‘calligraphic’ is imprecise and misleading, so should be ignored, but is what Paul is saying is that the normative forms of Devanagari letters are influenced by the use of a broad nib tool held at a particular angle, and that other scripts such as Tamil are influenced by different tools used in different ways, then this is a sound observation. He's playing it safe in treating Devanagari as he has in his Reading project, but if he chose not to play it safe, then he would have to deal with the contrast between the influence of traditional tools and methods on the normative shapes and trying to treat those shapes in different ways.

Scripts are not device-dependent, but nor are they entirely device-independent.</div>

Well put!

Originality in type design is a weird thing in that it is so hard to pin down, yet there is a remarkable degree of commonality in response to it, at least with a design that is excellent as well as original.  

For example Gotham is a revival and execution of traditional designs, yet people have widely responded to its freshness, particularly of the upper case. And even there it's hard to pin down what's new.  

Also the truth about the impact of teachers is somewhat elusive. Here are two opposite sayings about teaching. One,from the movie The Karate Kid: "There are no bad students, only bad teachers." The other from a prospective guitar teacher for my son when he was a teen: "It's not the teacher, it's the student."

No doubt there's truth and exaggeration in both, but the magic of what happens or not between teacher and student is a bit mysterious. </div>

Frutiger has tried it (Apollo), and Carter (Alisal), more no doubt, but these are not their most successful designs.
Goudy did it best.
That most calligraphic of modern classics, Palatino, has symmetrical serifs, demonstrating that serif style is not bound to stroke style.

John: I think the opposite is true, much more so in commerce than academia. Members of language groups whose scripts haven't progressed quite so much as the Latin don't wish to be chained to legacy technologies. Art directors and graphic designers everywhere want their DIN. Enterprising type designers are addressing this challenge. Yara Khoury of Al Mohtaraf, for instance, has designed a number of monoline Arabic faces, including a "Univers".

What's strange about it? What I'm trying to say is that there's a *really* narrow margin for innovation and novelty, when one's trying to design a workhorse typeface. Do you disagree with that? From what POV do you approach such project? For sure the brief will require that the typeface be functional, readable and legible. Those requirements alone constrain a lot of what can be done in terms of groundbreaking novelty. That's why getting those 5% is so difficult. And when you're designing a typeface for the first time that task can be almost unattainable.

> <em>because if a typographer or designer is making a choice between two or more ‘readable/legible typefaces’, then that 5% that accounts for their difference constitutes 100% of the value that determines the choice.</em>

I don't disagree with that completely. Because that also means that a typographer or designer will likely have less of a problem if he needs to swap text-typeface-A by text-typeface-B, whereas the task would be a lot harder if it were a display typeface. But, in practice there are more factors that affect the selection process, so I don't think that the onus solely falls on the 5% of novelty.</div>

What evidence do we have to prove that a good workhorse face must tack close to tradition? How many faces with lots of innovation and/or novelty even come in enough range to try using them as workhorse designs? Has the Adobe type team ever thought about doing something really crazy with a huge range of weights and optical styles instead of designing more faces derived from Renaissance type design? </div>

Almost all typefaces may be executed as both text and display fonts.
Does a workhorse become a thoroughbred when it is optically scale up?
So really, there is no such thing as a text typeface, just text fonts.

Admittedly, many "display" faces are not appropriate for extended setting of the main text in books and periodicals, but there is plenty of scope for at least minor idiosyncracies in typefaces for decks and sidebars which can run to many paragraphs, and which are most certainly read "immersively" -- and to which the fundamental principles of readability apply.</div>

Edit: This is particularly hilarious to me as I just challenged a "foundry" for releasing two fonts that are scarily similar, to put it mildly (and I mean almost identical), and their response was that they were assured by the reseller that they did not copy! Since they were calligraphic it was a no brainer for me. Like I cannot tell the difference between ******* and ********. I did that to protect the frickin guilty!</div>

I was thinking something less along the lines of Robert’s calligraphic designs—although you are right that these designs are pretty out there when it comes to complex families—and more along the lines of stuff from the artistic printing or postmodernist movements that starts to really break away from traditional western models for serifed letters.

Michael, I know where you’re coming from; there need to be more “Typeface No. 2s” if people are going to keep writing variations on a theme.</div>

And Greek that is more casual than the Latin.

I didn't say anything about tradition. The terms I used were functional, readable and legible.

What I can say, from my attempt at designing a text typeface, is that when I tried to take an unconventional approach, and add some quirkiness and distinctive features, the design became too distracting, which is definitely a quality you don't want to see in a text face. This doesn't mean that it's not doable to some degree. Warnock and Alisal, already mentioned, are two good examples. To those I would add Vendetta, by John Downer, and Prensa, by Cyrus Highsmith, for example.

My opinion also comes from observing Robert Slimbach's at work and from discussing the subject with him.</div>

Miguel
I was designing a catalogue for a war exhibit years ago. Jovica had just released his face and I found it idiosyncratic, sharp, disquieting and a bit angry. A perfect fit for the catalogue, as a text and titling face. Now I see that fonts can be used to imply a mood to those sensitive people who can see it, BUT the font can be used in "obscurity," as the other dunderheads who read it will not apply any personality to it... at least if it sets well.

Hey, I've spoken out, and my peers say hell no, Myriad ain't no Frutiger, and Helvetica is quite different from Akzidenz!

But who's targeting students?
They're getting much praise, and as James M explained, cannot be responsible for certain similarities of their work.

The important issue is whether it's good, bad, or irrelevant, in terms of the educational outcome.

Not a lot more for me to say, without some comment from the faculty.

Nick: <cite>That most calligraphic of modern classics, Palatino, has symmetrical serifs, demonstrating that serif style is not bound to stroke style.</cite>

I dunno. Definitely when I think of a new typeface, I don't necessarily take every little detail of what is more classic or established as the general rule. So I think it really depends. When I cited Jenson, I was just pointing that yes, there may be cases in which asymmetry in serifs isn't a redundant thing.

		<div class="commentbody">Miguel, I think we're looking at the same phenomenon from two different perspectives. One perspective looks at ‘functional, readable and legible’ as necessary goals of text typeface design, and hence considers what is extra to these -- the art, if you like -- as a small percentage of the task of type design. The other perspective considers ‘functional, readable and legible’ to be <em>prerequisites</em> rather than goals, which means that what is extra to them is something close to the whole matter of type design: it is to make typefaces that are not like other typefaces that is the raison d’être of most type design, certainly for the Latin script. We've got hundreds of ‘functional, readable and legible’ typefaces. The only possible justification for making more is that they are different.</div>

....or perhaps work within a (wider) system better. Allot of designs seem satisfied with just *one* instance. Its like: "Here I am - I'm  a very legible font" – and then that's it. This is so for the 'Legibility Group' Fonts Ionic, Excelsior et al even Times Roman. (list goes on...) So even though a vast number of legible fonts exists does not mean they are particularly useful other then being fine models and fantastic influence. I will back-track a little by saying though optical sizes did exist as metal, this is not the case for the notable revivals in the digital era (I don't think Time 327 exists in digital?). [I will back-track even further, yesterday I realised that Times 327 wasn't actually optical, but was simply more compact... but anyway...)

The systematic approach *is* being dealt with by Adobe (Pro Fonts), Font Bureau (Readability) and others... etc. 

Check Paul Shaw's article for this which covers contemporary examples: 'Scale and Spirit'. Eye 71. Volume 18. Spring 2009 pp. 62—69.

I see the work in this area still valid (yes it is very niche) when a broader net is cast. When solving more problems [i.e. creating a Bold for a Footnote (which is already bold)] will inevitably force the design to look different and so perhaps here on the outer limits of type design will then do a 'switch-back' and intern re-influence (the look or mechanics) of the rest of the typeface system?

...but once this work is done, perhaps will I have to agree, just changing the style a little is all that is needed and at which point I need to look for something else (more worthwhile) to do...

linking back to the argument: This is the stuff that is involving me now Where I was only allowed (time permitting)the concept of legible fonts working as part of a systemwas only able to exist as a *seed* at Reading.

To reflect a little on the theme of the thread, (and @John Hudson also alludes to this) in hindsight what my typeface *looks like* is insignificant just as long as it honestly is trying to accomplish set tasks (goals) (as was the orientation of my Reading Practical typeface brief). That being said, it is interesting get John's insight into to goals verses prerequisites. You could liken it to a shopping list with what you absolutely need and then the nice cakes (or shoes??)!

What would be particularly interesting is a distilling of this years designs shown with their original briefs [which are unfortunately hidden inside their RoPs (Reflections on Practice)] - Whether or not a student actually met their original goals would certainly be something to discuss rather then our feelings based on a cursory glance.

A very readable and successfull work of a modern interpretation with classic shapes is EASON from Randy Jones. He shows how to combine classic rules (and shapes) with the boundless possibilities of new computer software.

Agreed! I was never comparing Adobe Jenson to the original. I cited Adobe Jenson for the easiness of reaching its samples online (i.e. in MyFonts).

Well, it is a course, a school, it doesn't necessarily has the duty of releasing the best typefaces in the world every year to please the international type scene. ;)

I think David Brezina made the point some comments up. The 'sameness' come from similar briefs chosen by the students, being newspapers/dictionaries the preferred lately. And without a doubt, work from previous years end up having some influence on the new classes. 

I think most of the students that go to Reading go there not only to learn how to do a text font properly, but also for what the program offers. The course is not only about the practicals, there is a lot of research and writing involved, like already pointed by David, which can be related or not to your practical chosen brief. The main goal of the practical part is to fulfill your initial brief with an "as finished as possible" typeface, but as already said, all published fonts that came from Reading took some more time to be produced before being released, of course all students are very aware of that.

You are right, if you say, Reading is more a school, a course for drawing and 
designing letters.

What I want to say is, if Reading is just a school or a course, I would call it a very expensive course, just to learn the basics of Typedesign. Next is the degree, you get out there and call yourself Master of Typedesign, but what is the Title good for? I think if you get a Master Degree, your Master Work (Fonts, Typefaces, Thesis ...) should also be very excellence. About Research and writing, you talked about, I think it these two things for example are essential requirements if you apply for an Higher University Degree, or isn´t it?

Nothing new here, if you come from outside the UK (and specially from outside of Europe!), it is a very expensive course. It is more an UK-standards thing than the course being expensive on purpose.

The background of the students vary from people totally new to typedesign to people already doing typefaces. So it is much more about the experience of learning typedesign in a proper environment for that, rather than just learning the basics, or paying expensive to become a famous typedesigner. Your own process in learning/producing, your own achievements during the year, these kind of things end up being more important than anything else. 

Read some of the RoPs and have a look at [[http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/|some of the essays and dissertations]] to find out more.

The title of 'Master' is academic and fair, since we research/write a lot, and in accordance with academic moulds. It may be of good help for bringing good opportunities such as a job in the area, the chance of writing articles, etc, but of course that will depend a lot on you, on how far you dig for it. Fair enough, IMHO.

Whether an individual student met their goals doesn't address the issue at hand--which is the similar look.
The cursory glance is not judging the individual face, it is noting the similarity between (many of) them. The subsequent feeling is wondering whether this conformity serves any purpose, educationally, or might even be detrimental.

It would be interesting to hear what the faculty has to say.

You are using "cursory" as a disparaging term, but it would be short-sighted to dismiss what is immediately obvious to a great many people. The essays and dissertations are irrelevant to this. </div>

Then let's address this question even more broadly as this isn't only a feature of the MA program at Reading. Why do professional foundries also issue very similar typefaces? For example, why are we currently being inundated with slab-serifs? That is to say, I don't think the 'problem' of typeface design being a bit of a fashion industry and designers wanting to do 'what's hot' can be confined to the output of one school program. As with any any discipline, typeface design is subject to the ebb and flow of various trends. Why do all those impressionistic paintings all look blurry? Why can't I tell the difference between Didot and Bodoni? Why is a certain amount of 'sameness' such a bad thing? How divergent would you hope to see student projects? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Re teachers: Strong personalities tend to impress themselves upon students. That has been happening for ages. In my art school a few teachers had whole slews of lookalikes in tow. In most cases these students find their own ‘voice’ after a couple of years.

It’s not a bad thing. Strongheaded teachers are mostly good teachers.

Considering the line up at Reading I can see that most of the teachers there are in this category.

In another context: this thread is way off topic now. How about starting a new one to discuss the merits ‘one’ face versus ‘another’?

Yeah, I know – I'm not allowed to use verbs. They get me in trouble.
I'll leave it at that.

I am pretty comfortable that all fonts look 'similar' to a greater or lesser degree. They can't help it. They are all based on the same archetypal forms and readers are very conservative tending to be shocked at unusual letterforms - surely?

		<div class="commentbody">As far students project divergent from each other. In principle it should not be difficult, because like as students (normally humans at all), Fonts also are not alike and could be different in schools.
It depends also on the time, which one has available to create a font. Straight ones with a text fonts needs much time. It would be perhaps useful to sketch just a small part of a Typeface. For example just a regular type. In my opinion, to create a complete typeface (with italics too) it is too much for one year. Among them the quality suffers. Possibly not only the teachers affect the students separate themselves the students mutually. 

More is less!

One said, if someone really wants to waste time by creating a Diplayfont, then he can do it. That sounds very negative, which it should not be however. Better a high-quality display font, than a indifferent text font. I think that is probably because of the guidance of the university, which exerts influence as good and various the fonts are.

Bert you are right, the thread is way off topic!

		<div class="commentbody">@Idefix - Its the experience of trying the different styles out that is really important in the 6-8 months. And it is amazing what you can accomplish in that time. By trying out many things, you will end the course with the confidence that you indeed can do... an italic, a greek, a non-lat and a roman, and a bold and an italic - is that 2 italics, i just did one (in 2 days) wow!!! (that's alot) Then some people do more!

I also have high regard for Anette's Display face because of how she has pushed the style to work under reading conditions, but the person you mention being a bit negative about this also was correct because this is the time (on the course) to really learn the knowledge that you would otherwise not have an easy time getting at.

I am going to touch back on the dissertation - which I am busy finishing off now. It is only recently that I have fully appreciated how important it is in ordering out thought and clarifying ideas and concepts. Even though the knowledge is there in my head and I can use it instinctively in my work, trying to verbalise is a massive challenge. But now it has been forced out and fought with - to try and make coherent, its value shows.

@Nick is right that you dont need the written work to evaluate a type design. My angle on this that if there is no perspective - ie the brief or some note of intention then we are <cite>fumbling</cite> (Slap. Can't use verbs) around in the dark.

		<div class="commentbody">What a discussion. After remarks that many Reading typefaces are stylistically similar, a blast of replies:
-- We are informed about "similar briefs". I do not think that similar briefs need to result in similar typefaces. One can achieve similar effects in very different ways.
-- We are pointed to "research and writing". This discussion is about the typefaces, not about research and writing which, by the way, do not explain away anything. To the contrary. If research plays as an important role as has been emphasized, I wonder why, despite of it, the practical work is based on an ever same collection of ingredients or tricks.
-- We are advised to "address this question even more broadly". This discussion is about Reading, not about each and every typeface out there. (Of course type design is a fashion industry too. So it is even more important that students are made aware of it if they follow a current -- or outdated -- trend and are advised to look beyond that. Reading with its emphasis on type history should be the ideal place for this.)
-- And we are told that these are just "feelings based on a cursory glance" and we better "look more deeply". Sirs, this is outrageous. It is wonderful to hear that you, during a year of studying at Reading, have learned to 'see' type. But if now you think that everybody else is blind then you must be kidding (yourselves).

All of the comments that you have selectively highlighted (I believe) were made, when originally written –  in the spirit of investigation, discovery and discussion. Somehow you have made them appear (with what I assume are your comments) to the contrary? 

Though you have made a fantastic summery (ironically making it easier for someone to skip the entire thread), moving on... anyone might feel like they would be in for a 'right propper bashing' if they were to say anything beyond the obvious.

This is *way* too serious for me.

i'm sorry if suggesting a more personally interesting tangent to this conversation was taken to mean that others had not considered these ideas. that was not my intent. let me try again:

it seems that many critiques are based on the assumption that student work should be producing something new or different should that be the primary aim of education in typeface design. is it the novelty of a typeface that makes it worth the time of its development? is originality the most important aspect for design students to be learning? or what skills should students of typeface design be trying to develop?

i've attempted to answer as best i can from my perspective questions that people have made of the program, answering as someone who as done the program. i have no vested interest defending the Reading MA program. I have no interest in defending my own work as I feel that I don't have to as I am satisfied with the skills I learned through the program. the reason i have engaged in this conversation at all is because i feel that i have much yet to learn and am still asking questions in this thread, and then being chastised for stating my feeling and trying to better understand others' opinions on what makes for a good type design education. if this type of openess, and honesty and curiosity is 'outrageous' to you, then i'm sorry that i have not adequately contributed to this conversation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The 'outrageous' refers to the way Eben cut the discussion short: <cite>"look more deeply"</cite>. In his later explanation he mused: <cite>"So some, even many, (most?) graphic designers will not be able to quickly assess the MATD designs, or to be fair, any other group composed of text faces. I have been a member of that group."</cite> In sum this says, albeit in thoughtful and somewhat paternal tone (yes young man I once was like you), you who dare say that some Reading typefaces look similar are not able to judge type at all. The words are "in the spirit of investigation, discovery and discussion" but the message is not.

Mr Mello, I took the phrase from your post but could have quoted from Eben's posts as well. I addressed topoi running through the discussion rather than choosing bits and pieces "selectively" as Mr Hernan suggests.

There are no reasons for me to bash Reading. Reading does a good job. What's worse to me, that would offend people who and whose work I like. (Actually, it already did.) What I am talking about is the discussion about Reading. I was and still am astonished to see how observations that are far from new -- and can be and have been made about KABK too -- resulted in partially fiercy replies. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I had been wondering if I was the one who had been outrageous. :-P It may be that the tone of what I was saying is being misread or that I am being outrageous or that I have expressed myself poorly. Or perhaps all three.

I am sorry if I came across as paternalistic. Or made it look like I was squashing debate. That wasn't my intent. 

I do think that to many designers one text face looks very much like another. When I have net designers in the past and they find out that I am into type/a surprising number ( surprising to me ) have asked how they can better assess or choose a text face. They confess that that they have a hard time seeing differences. And as I said the pattern I described is also one that I have experienced as well, so to me it really rang true. It is also true that while this doesn't make us good or bad people but realistically we don't all have the same ability to asses type, especially type for text. This idea doesn't seem outrageous to me. Certainly I think my ability to assess text type has improved greatly while at Reading. But even more certainly I know I have much much further to go.

Also when I said look more deeply it wasn't meant to stop the discussion but literally to encourage people to look at the designs a bit more carefully than they seemed to be doing. I don't deny that things that seem similar are - on some level - similar irrespective of if you look deeply or not. So point taken. 

I haven't had time to talk about the details of what I meant, and if I had then I would have to think about if it was appropriate to do it or not. What I can say is I do like much of the type my classmates made - some of that is probably the result of knowing them, watching their process and liking and or admiring them as people. But some of it is genuine admiration of the work. 

Karsten I suspect than none of these ideas are in any way new to you. Moreover, I appreciate your being willing to take me to task if you feel that is what is appropriate. Feel free to continue if that is what you think best.

		<div class="commentbody">Fiona Ross is credited with the design of Linotype Manorama, designed for phototypesetting in the 80's, converted to DTP by Summit as Panchari, cloned by C-DAC as Revathi and with many other clones in many different names. Despite C-DAC's 50 typefaces and my 30 typefaces in Malayalam, the same font in its various cloned versions remains the most popular typeface in Malayalam—even after three decades—which speaks of its quality, historic relevance and more importantly Fiona Ross's ability to assimilate the spirit of the language. One cannot blame her if Reading students' donot match her skills. They have just started and have a long way to go and whatever glimpse they have shown is promising.

I have always felt that Reading fonts have a marked Gerard Unger stamp on them, though I am a fan of his style, with Swift being one of my all-time favourites. 

It is a different matter designing fonts for Indian scripts, most of them look like clones of existing fonts and nothing more. But I have always felt that one need to know a language (and culture) in depth to design something original (just how original can a font be is itself contentious) in it. We Indians often fail miserably when we try to design in another language other than our own mother tongue.

I am glad that Reading students have started looking beyond Roman, there are about a dozen Indian scripts which lack good variety fonts and if Reading students can create better Indian fonts after longer study, they would be as invaluable Ross's.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While I attended Goldsmiths, it was suggested that the strongest UK art/design institutions typically produce students with an 'in house' style. The reason is that those institutions recruit new students who share the 'in house' vision.

Put another way, the practice courses recruit new students with a portfolio that is compatible with the current strategic vision of the institution. That vision is predetermined by committee. My source is a well respected Goldsmiths researcher.

Consequently, it is expected that the majority of graduates will share a certain style. I think this comes across in the current thread.

Say, the spacing of 'capoeira' on the front page is simply wrong : the rounds are too loose, the i not spaced enough. I really like capoeira, guillotine, coline, anglaise and Enquire though. I am also self-teaching myself, so where am I wrong?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick mentioned "asymmetrical serifs" as characteristic of a supposed Reading house-style. I agree that there seems to be a style that is characteristic of Reading MATD productions at large.

Would someone please be kind enough to give or show examples of these asymmetrical serifs?

I'm more or less familiar with the look of Reading productions like Cassius, Vesper, and Malabar. 

Also would someone please explain why asymmetrical serifs are not necessarily a good thing? 

Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@_Palatine_  There is a point where the serif becomes too long and there is also a point where the serif is too short [from the point of view of the designer]. This might be different on either side of the glyphs stem, considering the whole of the letter and what the composite elements of the glyph are doing. Sometimes a serif may need to be shortened in the inside of a letter (n) to avoid serifs from becoming too close, with a chance of touching, when printed, and therefore closing up the character. When there are more than 2 or 3 occurrences of shortening the serifs on the inside of the letter this might suggest a style to populate throughout the character-set. I don't remember being told this, but it just seems to make common sense. 

I would have said this before... the course (any course) is a chance to try things out, why just do something boring and simple, try variety – experiment.

My font Pseudo considered serifs to be malleable like clay, where I could add a little or take away to give balance to the letter-forms.</div>

Given that, as noted, these are exercises and not products, there is nothing wrong with that. (Devanagari, of course, is the script used for Sanskrit and Hindi, among other languages, but not Tamil or Malayalam... or Tibetan or Thai or Gujarati, even if these scripts are indeed closely related to Devanagari.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps relevant to the discussion of non-Latin (specifically Indic) typefaces in this thread, I am running a little experiment in the following thread:

[[http://typophile.com/node/67613]]

I have long suspected that those who don't read a script simply don't see the same things that a typographically attuned native reader sees. I've posted a sample of the hangul (Korean alphabet) of two fonts bundled with Windows, Arial Unicode and Gothic. The latter is a solid if dated design by an influential twentieth-century Korean type designer, while the former is a disaster; even Koreans who don't pay much attention to typography wonder why the Korean is displaying all weird when they come across web pages or applications that display hangul in Arial Unicode.

You non-Korean speakers are welcome to comment on how you think the two compare in the sample.</div>

That is indeed a huge concern, but from what I've seen the Reading instructors try quite hard to avoid such overbearing influence (as all good teachers should).

You must've been thinking of the <em>other</em> school...
