  events, people, fonts, etc) that is typographically relevant or related to the 4th
  of July? Nothing serious. Just bored and curious.\r\n\r\nInterested to see what
  people have to say,\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    or signed on the fourth, I know, but at least it says, July 4, doesn't it?)

  body: "Will the Americans on the board will complain if I criticize the typography
    of the printed version? The measure is far too wide, for one thing.\r\n\r\nWere
    typographic principles the same 230 years ago? I know newspapers used much smaller
    type, as small as agate, which is about 5 point. Any comments?"
