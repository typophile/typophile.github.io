  body: Why would one set up Arial as a web font instead of counting on it being installed
    on the target computers? Who is paying the $15-$105/year to use Arial on their
    website?

    going to be looking at this and not have either of those installed? Just curious.

    is converted to fact. The web developer can make any assumption they want, but
    in the end, if a user doesn't fit the assumptions, it's too late once the site
    hits the user's screen.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    trying to do was rely on Arial. BUT, there aren't very many styles of Arial or
    Helvetica one can reasonably count on being available, compared to the number
    of styles of Helvetica that exist. If a designer wants a reasonable \"palette\"
    of styles to work with, some other web font solution seems called for, besides
    relying on system fonts.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    to use all the extended weights such as Ultra Light. As such, that doesn't really
    leave us with many valid clones. Looks like we're going to go the Linotype route
    and will looking web license options down the road. \r\n"
