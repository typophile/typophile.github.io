  I work for and no one seems to know what it is. I've tried identifont and whatthefont
  with no success. \r\n\r\nThe closest I've found is Coptek regular, but that is a
  lot more blocky. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated, even finding something that's
  really close but not perfect.\r\n\r\nThank you![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo_5934.jpg]"
