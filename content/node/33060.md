body: "Lady Liberty holds a tablet engraved with:\r\n\r\n     JULY\r\n      IV\r\nMCCLXXVII\r\n\r\nThis
  tablet was sculpted in 1883 by a team of builders in Paris based on a design developed
  between 1865 and 1875 by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi of Alsace. The lettering resembles
  a condensed version of Bank Gothic, which Morris Fuller Benton designed in 1930
  for ATF, except that the angles of the terminals (e.g., C, J) are squared off rather
  than diagonal.\r\n\r\nI spent part of today doing web searches for detailed information
  on the history of sans serif typefaces prior to Akzidenz Grotesk, looking for some
  hints, but I find instead everyone repeating the same history post-AG.\r\n\r\nSo
  . . .\r\n\r\nIs the tablet's lettering original, or is it based on some contemporary,
  sans serif typeface?\r\n\r\nAnd, where can I find a detailed history of sans serif
  typefaces prior to AG?\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nRick Marshall\r\n\r\n"

  body: Okay, moments after posting the above, I did find a good discussion of pre-AG
    sans serif typefaces, <a href="http://typophile.com/node/19482">here on typophile</a>
    of course!

  body: "<em>Anatomy of a Typeface</em> by Alexander Lawson has a reasonable discussion
    of sans serif history in his chapter \"Franklin Gothic and the Twentieth-century
    Gothics,\" but he like most authors skims through the nineteenth-century sans
    serif types. The other typophile thread gives fuller information on them, but
    not enough to identify Lady Liberty's tablet lettering, alas.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

    close.
