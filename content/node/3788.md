body: 'Bonjour, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on an experimental font for titling, using
  Fontlab with the calt feature &#40;ot&#41;. <BR>Please have a look to the attached
  files to see how i&#39;m trying to do... &#34;Abracadabra&#34; version is less important,
  it will be the result of a random feature. <BR>To obtain the effect of deformation
  that you can see in the &#34;colonel&#34; exemple, I&#39;ve created 5 sizes in the
  same font. First I digit my word with lowercases, then I choose one letter &#40;in
  the middle of the word&#41; and I change it in capitals &#40;the biggest size&#41;.
  <BR>I&#39;ve created five classes for each sizes &#40;from the very small to the
  biggest : minuscules, petites, moyennes, grandes, capitales&#41;, and I&#39;ve tried
  to apply calt feature to make contextual substitutions. <BR>The code : <BR> <BR>feature
  calt { <BR>  sub @minuscules&#39; @capitales by @grandes;   #first level of sub.
  <BR>  sub @capitales @minuscules&#39; by @grandes; <BR>  sub @minuscules&#39; @grandes
  by @moyennes;   #second level of sub. <BR>  sub @grandes @minuscules&#39; by @moyennes;
  <BR>  sub @minuscules&#39; @moyennes by @petites; <BR>  sub @moyennes @minuscules&#39;
  by @petites; <BR>} calt; <BR> <BR>The problem is that the program consider only
  the first substitution. The second and the third substitution refer to the first
  substitution, but it doesn&#39;t works because everything is in the same feature.
  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s quite clear for you, it&#39;s so difficult to explain
  in my bad english... My question is : do I need to put some lookups to make that
  the first level of substitution takes effect, so the second will may refers to...  <BR>
  <BR>Thank you so much for your patient attention <BR> <BR>E.A.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/29230.jpg"
