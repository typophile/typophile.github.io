  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Suddenly when I remove overlap ("Merge Countours") in a MM-font it makes something similar to "Expand Masters" and I cant figure out why. Before, it always kept the original masters but removed the overlap, now it takes the master I have visible and make that one as master on every master.

Is this some preference in FontLab that I happen to click "on" or "off"?

Desperately Thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">Goran, 

I'm quite surprised that you're saying it ever worked. I don't remember that it ever worked. The problem is: imagine an MM glyph with two squares (so there are 8 nodes in the glyph). In the first master the squares are small and do not overlap, in the second master the squares are larger and overlap. A perfectly normal case. Now if you'd try to remove the overlaps, the first master should not change but in the second master it would have to remove some nodes, so you'd end up having incompatible masters. 

This is why remove overlap in FLS is not MM-compatible. I agree it would be nice if the function was written so that it removes overlap in each master and then blends the masters together, and "fails" only if the final masters are not compatible. I'll suggest that to our developers. 

In the meantime, I suggest that you leave the overlaps in your MM and remove them only in the generated instances.

That's why I found interesting Goran's post,
because this would be a wonderful time saving procedure.

Right now I'm working with 6 masters and it would be nice to have this feature for glyphs that has cedillas,
carons, slashes and so on.

Adam,
this would be a nice improvement for the next FontLab update.

BUT.. I noticed that if I take away two masters, from my existing four-master project, it works again. So I guess the functionality is built in in FontLab but does not work with more than two masters.

		<div class="commentbody">For compatible outlines, in the way Göran describes, it has worked for all 5.x-releases for fonts with two masters but not for more.

A workaround if you work with a 4+ master font is to generate an single master instance for each master, do the merging on each one of them, go back to the MM font and assign masks from on single master at a time and use the mask to outline function for that master. It works if the outlines are compatible,

It works good on the Eth, hbar and dcroat, for instance, but with the Oslash and the Euro, I think it's better when you do it in each generated instance, because sometimes the interpolation of round/straight connections don't work quite well.

Dino, yes I agree :) Unfortunately I have a habit on working with contours like this when designing and devloping (and now everybody understands why I want to merge the countours now and then):

<em>Working</em> with 3 or 6 masters is possible, that's what I'm doing right now having intermediate masters. This is often a good approach for families going from thin to black. As you say, the total number of masters in the font is always 2 raised to the number of the axes but you don’t have to utilize all the masters.

Not necessarily, it depends on how you set up the masters. I have a 4 master project where the third master is never in use at all. It might influence operations such as auto-hinting, but not the final outlines in the single masters.

The third master can have square shaped o’s or whatever without interfere with the outlines that goes from thin (first master) to regular (second master) and from regular (second master) to ultra (fourth master).

Karsten,

cool, looks like a more advanced version of what I have written. Mine also copies kerning, though. I can send you the code and you can merge it into yours if you want.

Mårten,

<cite>I have a 4 master project where the third master is never in use at all.</cite>

Yes, if you always keep one axis slider at 0 then the fourth master is actually irrelevant and can be ignored. However, if you want to mix the three masters at an arbitrary ratio with FontLab then all four masters will be used even if you only want to mix three of them.</div>
