  project is a real low budget wonder so I can't buy a font.\r\n\r\nThe project is
  for a southern old country-style press that is printing really modern comics. So
  I used rosewood fill hand kerned for the logo. Now I have to come up with a font
  to put everything else in: I want it to go and look intentional, but express the
  old/new part too.\r\n\r\nhere are the sans serif fonts I am considering (own), please
  help me pick one (it will be in all caps):\r\n\r\ninterstate\r\nhelvetica neue\r\navenir\r\nmeta\r\nrotis\r\nswiss\r\n\r\nthanks
  for any and all suggestions!\r\n\r\n"

    \ and a classic look to contrast the decoration in Rosewood; Neutraface or Futura
    would both work, as would Avenir. The neo-grotesks seem less appropriate; they\u2019re
    a little to cold and inhuman to pair with Rosewood, and even though Meta is warmer
    than helvetica, interstate and swiss, it feels to new to pair with Rosewood. "

    basically the same anyways.\r\nBTW. What\u2019s so cold about Meta and Interstate
    compared to the other choices in your list?"
