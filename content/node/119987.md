  body: "If you look at the File > Properties > Fonts information in the PDF file,
    it lists all the used typefaces:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fonts1_4880.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fonts2_3593.png]\r\n\r\nLydian
    is used for Winter 2013 at the very top, as well as for the Daily Specials heading;
    Aaux Pro Bold is used for the menu headers (Breakfast, Lunch, etc.); Engraver's
    Gothic is used for the item names and prices; Franklin Gothic is used for the
    item descriptions; and Farnham Display is used for the item numbers (far left).\r\n\r\nAaux
    Bold appears to be the identity/logo typeface, but I think the Geometric Slab
    Serif they use on their website is more interesting:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-slabserif-703/"
