  of the twentieth century. \r\nLooking around the net the only one that seems to
  look like it's the Chienna, but it isn't.\r\n\r\nMay you help me please?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "The German expressionist font used in your poster is called Habsburg. It
    was designed by Heinrich (Heinz) Keune at J.G. Schelter & Giesecke, Leipzig, in
    1903. He also designed a narrower version called Wittelsbach. Here are two fonts
    as shown in a S&G Schriften und Initialen type specimen book from the era [img:sites/default/files/old-images/HabsburgSM_6529.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/WittelsbachSM_6650.jpg]

    neither font has been digitized.\r\nHowever, as previously suggested, Moritz is
    almost identical and would work as a digital substitute.\r\nDon"
