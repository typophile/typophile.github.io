  downloaded or paid for it somewhere but I've lost the file and have been searching
  online for the font for 17 hours. Please help! I don't know the name. I need it
  for a couple products I'm making for a client and the deadline is by tomorrow. The
  font has to match, as I used it as his logo on all his other products. It will be
  a huge let down if I can't reproduce this for him. Here's my email address: SpittingImageGraphics@gmail.com\r\nTHANKS
  FOR ANY HELP OR INFO!"

    5]] is the one you want, with a great deal of vertical scaling going on.

      Luckily my customer decided to change their business name at the last minute
      to POWERHOUSE ENTERTAINMENT, so I was able to talk him into a different font.
      I'm still glad that you told me that it was Nightmare 5 because he said he wants
      to use it in the future and It's just cool.
