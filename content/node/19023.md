  body: "I half-expected this to be in the Dover Pattern Alphabets book (most of the
    fonts in it are just Futura Extra Bold with different effects applied).\r\n\r\nRay
    Larabie's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/budmo/\" target=\"_blank\">Budmo</a>
    is a nice alternative with only one line of dots. It's free, so it's worth a try.\r\n\r\n
