    a coffee table book devoted just to one series. No matter how cool an Absolut
    ad is the chances of anyone noticing are next to nil. So this brilliant guy comes
    along, blatantly riffs on Sagmeister, while Sagmeister is surfing in Indonesia,
    with an ad about being different. And every design geek on Earth gets incensed
    and demands that everyone stop and look at what Absolut is doing. And for the
    next year the design police will be blogging about every Absolut promotion in
    relation to this scandal. The only sad thing is how many designers don\u2019t
    realize that they\u2019re being manipulated by advertising\u2014am I the only
    one who went to an art school that made a semester of critical thinking part off
    the curriculum?"

    the 90s, when they would appear in WIRED magazine... They weren't ripping off
    artists then, they were working <em>with</em> them, and hiring them to do ads!
    (This Keith Haring ad is from the 80s, but you get the point.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/haring-absolut-ad_6669.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
    not saying that controversy doesn't generate publicity or word-of-mouth (think
    Benetton), but plagiarizing an artist's work (any artist's, not just Sagmeister)
    could backfire against them... I think they've shot themselves in the foot here.\r\n\r\n<em>And
    every design geek on Earth gets incensed and demands that everyone stop and look

    an artist who knows how to really toy with his audience. It\u2019s like Hirst
    sticking dead animals into tanks of preservative and selling it to the gullible
    nouveau riche just so people will argue about whether or not a dead shark in a
    glass box is art and how much the price tag has to do with the definition. "

  body: Frankly I don't see the problem with Absolut's ad. Exploring creating type
    out of found materials or experimenting with type in nature is hardly patented
    by Sagmeister nor does he have a copyright on the idea. If Absolut had stolen
    or ripped off his work, fine, I get it, but they didn't. Maybe the author was
    inspired by Sagmeister's work, maybe the designer was inspired by something else
    (hell, we've done type in food experiments here on typophile, does that make us
    rip off artists too?), but there was no theft involved here. If anything, maybe
    it is an homage to Sagmeister's work and how different his work is from everyone
    else. Who knows?

  body: "Both videos comprise sentences with words formed from raw materials in a
    variety of environments.\r\nI don't think it's possible to say whether or not
    plagiarism is involved.\r\n\r\n(You could trace the \"each sequential shot is
    a word in a sentence\" concept back to the Pennebaker 1965 \"video\" of Bob Dylan's
    Subterranean Homesick Blues, or earlier. I made a film a bit like that in 1974,
    with a number of people each saying a word in sequence.)\r\n\r\nHowever, when
    a creative comes up with something that bears a strong resemblance to well-known
    currently fashionable/popular work, even if there is no plagiarism involved, it's
    best to kill that baby, for the sake of reputation.\r\n\r\nBut if the \"second
    man in\" already has a substantial reputation, or both have equal reputations,
    they are not so likely to get called on it.\r\n\r\nIt happens in type design..."

  body: "<em>But this time it\u2019s an artist who knows how to really toy with his
    audience.</em>\r\n\r\nIs everyone in said audience a graphic designer? Or familiar
    with Stefan Sagmeister? I'm sure plenty of Absolut vodka drinkers out there are
    not graphic designers, or are even aware of Sagmeister's work. So how will this
    impact those members of the audience?\r\n\r\nAs I implied earlier, if this ad
    is courting controversy, <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/agencyspy/tbwachiat_day/origin_of_an_idea_absolut_v_art_123660.asp\">its
    creator(s)</a> did not aim for the largest possible audience. So, I still think
    they lamely copied a concept by someone whose work they admire, and now someone
    noticed, and they (the agency) look bad, and their client (Absolut Vodka) will,
    too. Nothing brilliant about it.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of Sagmeister and slavish
    imitation, I think <a href=\"http://www.coroflot.com/public/individual_file.asp?individual_id=152664&portfolio_id=1400410&\">this</a>
    is absolutely brilliant. :-)"

    new. This is what art directors and writers do from time to time. Last 'uproar'
    I remember is the Honda Accord commercial vs Weiss & Fischli's \"The Way Things
    Go.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not it's inspired from Sagmeister's type project, the
    Absolut ad fails. It has no idea, just execution."

    the first time and searched "Absolut Sagmeister" to see if the commercial was
    in fact his work Typophile was the first search result. Go figure. I''m a little
    disappointed that it''s not. As far as the issue of plagiarism, sure Sagmeister
    has no patent on the way he manipulates type, but this ad is so similar I would
    say it''s definitely a little unethical. '
