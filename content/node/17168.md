  body: "You can also license directly from <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_eideticneo.html\"
    target=\"new\">PSY/OPS</a>. One of the benefits is that you have the option of
    picking up Eidetic Neo and <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_eidetm.html\"
    target=\"new\">Eidetic Modern</a> (the corresponding sans) in a bundle for 15%
    off the standalone price.\r\n\r\nPSY/OPS also offers other cool stuff like a free
    weight for every $100 spent, a 15% student discount, and the option to try out
    a single weight and then deduct its cost from that of the whole family if you
    decide to purchase a family license within 30 days."

  body: "Word. I already picked up two weights of <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_eideticneo.html\"
    target=\"new\">Armchair Modern</a> with my home licenses of <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_sophisto_ss.html\"
    target=\"new\">Sophisto</a> and <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_oxtail.html\"
    target=\"new\">Oxtail</a>, and the corporate-wide licenses for Sophisto and <a
    href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_eideticneo.html\" target=\"new\">Eidetic
    Neo</a> made <a href=\"http://www.magelaan.be/\" target=\"new\">my employer</a>
    pick up the other weights of Armchair Modern and the frankly surprising and very
    exciting <a href=\"http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_hydrous.html\" target=\"new\">Hydrous</a>.\r\n\r\nThe
    complimentary free licenses allow you to try out stuff you maybe wouldn't think
    of. Plus -- I've said it before and I'll say it again -- [[psy_ops|Psy/Ops]] has
    one of the most consistent and forward-thinking compact collections on the market.
    Classy on the outside, quirky on the inside. Melts in yo' brain, not in your eyes.
    You can't go wrong, really."
