body: "I'm currently working at a public service office, and up until now we've been
  using the Neo Sans font for posters, brochures etc. But we've decided it's best
  to open up for most of the employers to use font stated as our official font (from
  the graphic profile). And for now the budgets don't work well with buying license
  for Neo Sans for hundreds of people.\r\n\r\nSo my question is this. Is there a font
  similar to Neo Sans (including letters like \xE6, \xF8 and \xE5) that is free of
  use available?"

  body: 'Yes. Titillium is a similar nice replacement for your needs. I also would
    suggest Ubuntu. http://font.ubuntu.com/ or Oblik Bold (free) http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/tour-de-force/oblik
    http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tdf/oblik/ that are also very professional and with
    complete character sets. '
