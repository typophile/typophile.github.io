  and that is why I have just devoured the forums without being able to contribute.
  But after some very interesting threads\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/17260\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/36423\r\n\r\nI
  guess it\u2019s time someone wrapped me in a straightjacket for otherwise I will
  strangle the next person who tongue-in-cheek asks for \u201Ca free font very similar
  to that famous \u2026\u201D.\r\n\r\nOf course I always realized that it is hard
  work to create a typeface, but the amount of individual and collective theory development,
  historical research and meticulous craftsmanship involved makes me feel grateful
  that as a single non-commercial user I spend only 20 to 50 Euro for a good font.\r\n\r\nThanks
  to all you professionals!\r\n"

  body: I'm not sure, ignoring those threads without educating "those people" will
    just make them look somewhere else (like some russian forum) and end with some
    pirated font. If they are on typophile they may be cheap but they are at least
    trying to do the right thing.
