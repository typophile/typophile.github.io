  body: Adobe Garamond? It's awfully small.

  body: Yeah, it is definitely small... I thought Adobe Garamond as well, but I can't
    seem to match it up... I think the lowercase i is a circle as opposed to a triangle
    with garamond.... I have garamond pro and premier pro and none of them really
    match up with it.

  body: There are rendering issues with the web. "29th" clinched it for me. I think
    the top nav is semibold and the rest is regular.

  body: 29th Hole may be a different font though... I didn't do that part, another
    designer did after my initial design, and it looks a bit different to me. What
    do you think?

  body: Yeah. It's mighty small. Could it be Hoefler Text or Requiem?

  body: I think there are at least four fonts here, which is why one font doesn't
    match all of it. My best guesses are Adobe Garamond ("29th Hole", bottom), Adobe
    Garamond Bold (top left), Palatino (middle, except for "29th Hole"), and Times
    Bold (upper right).
