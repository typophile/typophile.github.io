  around with these letterforms after looking at a collection of early 60's rock 'n'
  roll album covers.\r\n\r\nNudgewink's baseline bounces around randomly but if a
  cap glyph sets high, it's lower case will set low and vice versa. Each glyph has
  an alternate on the same baseline but with a different weight stress or attitude.\r\n\r\nWith
  so many possible combinations, I couldn't figure out how to set up the code for
  a contextual alternate OT feature. So you have to go in and hand tune the thing.
  \r\n\r\nIt's a bit of work but I have found that process fun to play around with.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.p22.com/ihof/nudgewink.html|Check
