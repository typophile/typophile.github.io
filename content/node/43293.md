  love to hear what the crew think about it. The client wanted something sexy, provocative
  but classy. They were also quite keen on the neon sign look.  Go wild...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ell_5952.gif]"

  body: It sure is a funky logo and would definitely look sexy in neon. The word 'electric'
    looks, well, electric. 'ladyland' however seems hidden; my guess would be that
    the high connection between the 'l' and the a's obstruct the word shape and thus
    make it a puzzle... I love the bubbles though.

  body: "I would consider what <cite>electric</cite> means in its original context.
    Not that it <cite>should</cite> be psychedelic in any way, but that you might
    find some liberties yet to be taken.\r\n\r\nMaybe a touch more Mucha and a little
    less J-Pop."
