  body: "Given the 1966-67 publication dates this may have been a typeface that never
    got digitized, or was never a font in the first place.\r\nI have looked through
    the Encyclopedia of Typefaces but have not seen this particular one."

  body: Very "[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/compacta|Compacta]]" but all eyes are
    narrower. Same vein is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/jampact-nf/|Jampact]]
    but the overall design is off. There's also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/plakette/|Plakette]]
    but /R leg finial is different.

  body: "Yes, Atwe, I'm afraid there is no digital version.\r\nWas hoping to find
    a surrogate, something not too squared but still not too \"funny\". \r\nToo bad,
    anyway: really love that masthead.  "
