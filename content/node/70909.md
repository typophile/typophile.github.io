    fonts I've liked,off the top of my head:\r\nMemoriam, Narziss, and piqued by the
    upcoming Dala Flodo.\r\nI think these interest me because I have occasionally
    thought of making types along these lines, and because their drawing is so virtuoso
    -- that's one of things I respect most in other type designers' work.\r\nThe line
    of beauty, to use Hogarth's term, is infinitely subtle, which is why I reject
    the idea that \"it's all been done before\"."

  body: "Who cares, it's all letters, letters are all the same, am I right?! =D\r\n\r\nWe
    should point blkkkkk to some noticeably different glyphs between Helvetica (which
    is used in the sample) and Interstate: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D41%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DSAINT%2520CYR%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%252Cot.liga%26seed%3D23|notice
    S, C and R]]. See how Helvetica is closed with horizontal terminals and Interstate
    is not? See how the leg on the R waves?\r\nComing to Typophile trying to willingly
    teach someone something is a faux-pas. :P We all learn with one another, but we
    usually don't intend to actually teach. :P\r\n\r\nThat being said, today I'd probably
    say my favourites are:\r\n- Freight (the whole family, Sans and Micro included)\r\n-
    Columbus (I've liked it for ages, there's something about it\u2026)\r\n- Mommie\r\n-
    Auto (let's be honest, it's actually \u201Canything from Underware\u201D)\r\n-
    Fedra (the whole family)\r\n- Taz III (doesn't really work for me when on a screen,
    but printed I find it just wonderful)\r\n- Lexicon? (\u201Canything from TEFF\u201D
    applies, I just picked one; the new Geronimo is beautiful, and designed by a fellow
    portuguese to boot!)\r\n- Parisine (loving it)\r\n- Stern (also loving it)\r\n-
    Quadraat (the whole family), Fairfield, Californian, Electra, Mr. K, Requiem,
    Brioso, Rialto, Caecilia, Seria, Poetica, Brokenscript, Vista, Malaga, strong
    calligraphic cursive scripts like Polenta or Marigold\u2026\r\n\r\nOk, I give
    up, I can't possibly pick just ten."
