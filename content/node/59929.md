body: "I'm needing to purchase a variety of Jansen Text font where numbers 3-8 do
  not share the same height/baseline as numbers 1 and 2. In Open Type, which I intended
  to buy, they all appear the same. Is this example accurate or is there perhaps a
  feature to Open Type fonts that needs to be used to achieve the different heights?
  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/879/jansontext-family.html?subviewmode=FONTS&samplestr=123456789\r\n\r\nIn
  TrueType and PostScript Jansen Text @Roman SC, the numbers do vary in height. Does
  one have to use these then?\r\n\r\nAppreciatively,\r\nLuca"

  body: "Hello Luca,\r\n\r\nyou are talking about old-style figures (OSF, also called
    [[text figures]], with ascenders and descenders), versus [[lining figures]] (LF,
    also ranging figures, all of the same height).\r\nThe OpenType versions of Janson
    Text do have both versions, OSF <em>and</em> LF. So do most recent OpenType releases
    of text fonts, btw. You can view the available glyphs in the character map:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/en/422933/jansontextpro55roman-charactermap.html\r\n\r\nYes,
    in savvy applications like Adobe InDesign, you can (separately or globally) switch
    the figure style via an OpenType feature.\r\nMore information: <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/figuring-it-out-osf-lf-and-tf-explained/\">Figuring

  body: "Not all layout applications support OpenType features.\r\nSo although a font
    may have alternatives to the default figure style, they could be inaccessible.\r\nTherefore
    it's important to check which is the default style of figure in the font, as this
    can vary according to the foundry's opinion of what would be most appropriate.\r\n\r\n"
