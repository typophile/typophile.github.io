  body: Eric,  <BR> <BR>what system/FontLab version are you running? Did you get the
    macro from steroids.fontlab.net? What exactly is the problem when you&#39;re trying
    to run it?  <BR> <BR>Adam

  body: 'Adam - <BR> <BR>I&#39;m running FontLab 4.6, Python 2.3 and the script is
    from the <BR>steroids download you mention. I&#39;ve placed my .ren file within
    <BR>the Mapping folder as instructed in the script too. <BR> <BR>I have a few
    dozen T1 files that I&#39;m breaking into full featured <BR>OpenType fonts. Currently
    I&#39;m trying to rename the small caps: <BR>a to a.smcp <BR>b to b.smcp <BR>c
    to c.smcp <BR>etc. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve set them up as detailed in the script: <BR>a
    a.smcp <BR>b b.smcp <BR>c c.smcp <BR>etc. <BR> <BR>Thinking I may have set something
    up incorrectly I also <BR>ran some of the Tiro rename files and but got the same
    result. <BR> <BR>After running the script I get: <BR>&#34;OK, glyphs renamed&#34;
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure what would be causing this. <BR> <BR>Thanks'

  body: Eric,  <BR> <BR>1. Which &#42;operating system&#42; are you using? &#40;Exactly&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>2. So, you run the script and the &#42;only&#42; thing you see is &#34;OK,
    glyphs renamed&#34;? You don&#39;t see the dialog box? Or do you see the dialog
    box, run the script, get the &#34;OK, glyphs renamed&#34; message but the glyphs
    themselves aren&#39;t actually renamed? Are they color-marked?  <BR> <BR>Please
    try to describe everything you are doing and everything that happens, step-by-step.  <BR>
    <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam

  body: I&#39;m running OSX - Panther 10.3.5 <BR> <BR>I get the dialog box, run the
    script, and then recieve the <BR>&#34;Ok, glyphs renamed&#34; message. I&#39;ve
    checked the option <BR>to mark the glyphs that have been changed - though <BR>they
    don&#39;t as the names aren&#39;t changing. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s it, step by step.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m able to run my other Python scripts without a problem. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: Adam, I&#39;m not sure if this is the issue that Eric is encountering, but
    I had a problem with the rename glyphs script last year when some .ren files I
    created had Unicode encoding instead of &#39;DOS&#39;. [I made them in UltraEdit,
    with which I know you are familiar, and had set up my preferences so that every
    new document was automatically Unicode encoded.] When I converted the .ren files
    to &#39;DOS&#39; encoding, the script worked. <BR> <BR>Is it possible that your
    script requires 8-bit text?
