body: 'Hello! So here''s my story: I''m a pastor. I love design and type, but I am
  not a designer by profession or training. I recently took a new position, and (like
  many or most churches) the design is abysmal or non-existant.  Think word art, and
  newsletter with said word art created in (no, I''m not kidding) Microsoft Word.  Also,
  no logo, no unified font choice (different fonts in bulletin, newsletter, website,
  letterhead, etc.) On the one hand, this is exciting for me, because there is real
  progress to be made. On the other hand, it''s horrifying, because there is so much
  to do, and I don''t know where to start. At some point, I would like to hire someone
  to consult and help us create a full identity that we can use across all these platforms.
  In the meantime, what baby steps would y''all suggest that will help 1. Create a
  sense of seriousness and 2. Raise consciousness, subtly, with folks so they start
  to see how important design is and what a difference it can make for their organization.  Thoughts? '

    least about the "outward-facing" stuff your church is producing. '

  body: "Traci, I've done some design work for churches and have a few thoughts. \r\n\r\nThis
    first step I'd suggest is research. Think about the history of your church and
    the direction it's going in the future. Explore the websites of large, well-known
    churches, everything from St. Pauls in London to the the Washington National Cathedral,
    etc.(their sites are far bigger than what you'll need but are usually professionally
    designed), and also look for nicely designed websites of small churches too. You're
    looking for examples of professionally designed church logos, websites, publications,
    etc.  \r\n\r\nI would suggest keeping quiet about this project in the early stages,
    or you run the risk of a church member saying \"let's let the youth [or whoever]
    design our logo!\", or \"Mr. Jones came up with a [terrible] logo and everyone
    thinks we should use it!\" Before talking to the congregation about it, I'd suggest
    giving this project some careful thought and then approach the appropriate committee
    to get their support for a systematic approach to this project. \r\n\r\nOne big
    difference between designing for business and designing for a church is that in
    business the company's president can decide what design direction to take and
    everyone else better follow his/her lead or else. In a church setting, things
    are often a little messier, with committees and individuals who have strong feelings
    and who don't want to be pushed into something they don't like. So for a pastor
    it's probably a good idea to approach this carefully and make sure that before
    you implement your new logo & identity system that your designs have the support
    of key committees and then present the designs to the congregation at a business
    meeting to discuss and hopefully approve.\r\n\r\n(I'm talking mainly about the
    logo; the congregation doesn't need to see or approve every detail, such as the
    layout of the bulletin or newsletter.)\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is that church
    positions such as newsletter editor, bulletin editor, web editor, etc. are often
    filled by well-intentioned volunteers who may not have much design experience.
    Or these jobs may be done by the pastor who already has a very, very busy schedule.
    So my advice for those things is to create templates and easy-to-follow guidelines,
    and be prepared to accept that although they look a lot better than they did before,
    they're never going to be perfect. (Unless you hire someone with design experience
    to prepare them each time, which is beyond the budget of most smaller churches.)\r\n\r\nIf
    you do hire a designer, some general advice is to look carefully at their portfolio,
    check out their references, ask if you can contact some of their previous clients
    to see how the projects went, and be sure to talk about budgets and timeframe.
    And some may disagree with this, but I'd suggest getting someone local, if possible,
    as I think you can better size up the person you're hiring when you can talk to
    them in person, plus certain things like designing signage (I presume you'll update
    your signs) are easier in person."

    you made me laugh, because you clearly know church work very well. "Let''s let
    the youth design the logo!" "Let''s use this piece of clip art for our logo!"
    You are absolutely right that these thoughts will be brewing in the background
    for awhile.  I appreciate this thoughtfulness. Old Nick''s point about simplicity
    is well taken as well. Thanks, everyone. '
