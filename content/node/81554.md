  body: If it shows up in the font menu for InDesign, it will show up in the font
    menu for Illustrator, assuming both programs are of reasonably similar vintage
    AND on the same computer...

  body: Right... unless the font file is located in a private InDesign location, such
    as a "fonts" folder in the InDesign app folder.

  body: 'In fact, I can''t even select those two fonts in inDesign though they are
    in the Required/Fonts folder of the application. So, I guess that all the fonts
    I can see in inDesign are installed systemwise. '

  body: "Yes\u2014but some folks use the private InDesign fonts folder as a sort of
    font management shortcut. Older versions of the app installed fonts there, also.\r\n\r\n(And
    apologies for the post duplication above. Got fooled by TypeKit's lengthy lag
    after hitting post....)\r\n\r\nT"
