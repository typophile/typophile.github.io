  Type Founders and Michael Doret are proud to announce the Release of Dark Angel,
  a \u201Cblackletter/hybrid\u201D font. This font had its genesis in a logo sketch
  for the Anaheim Angels baseball team\u2014thus its name.\r\nType purists may be
  appalled by the lack of adherence to traditional forms, but the font should be seen
  as only \u201Cin the spirit of\u201D blackletter, and attempting something that
  hasn\u2019t been seen or done before\u2014something that feels traditional, yet
  at the same time fresh and perhaps unexpected.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2-DA_Header_5479.png]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nDark
  Angel can be purchased in its regular solid form, or as Dark Angel Underlight\u2014a
  handtooled font. If these two fonts are purchased together, the Family package will
  contain a third font\u2014Dark Angel Highlight. With this font layered over the
  basic font, you can achieve two\u2013color typesetting when the highlight and the
  base font are assigned two different colors.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3-DA_3Fonts_5571.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4-DieYoung_3979.png]\r\nWith

  the look of your copy to suit your needs. Compare the two samples below. Some characters
  have multiple alternates.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5-Plain_Fancy_5122.png]\r\nAnd
