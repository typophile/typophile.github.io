body: "I just started a new job for a company that publishes technical and scientific
  journals and I'm training on Xyvision - a Batch Pagination software program. As
  a career InDesign user, I'm pretty much out of my element. I'm learning more macros
  than I know what to do with and getting more and more frustrated every day. \r\n\r\nI'm
  just wondering if anyone can explain to me why this software is used, versus the
  much more user-friendly InDesign? Or even the more basic Quark? It seems like companies
  would save boatloads of money on manpower and training if they went to this. Perhaps
  there is some industry rule that I am missing out on, but I would love to know."

  body: "I'm sure they've been using Xyvision for a very very long time. Intertia
    (a.k.a. switching costs) is probably a big part of it.\r\n\r\nIt's also very possible
    that Xyvision has some particular features for scientific/technical stuff that
    they can't get (or that require expensive add-ons) in QuarkXPress and InDesign.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I have never used Xyvision, but I can empathize with you for I myself have
    been around a number of proprietary software applications that are cumbersome
    at best to use. One of them being Preps, which is a pagination application for
    production folk. It doesn't even run in OSX, and the software is free, lol, but
    the silly little key that you have to have costs about $5k I was told. It's horribly
    confusing, and anyone who does not already know how to use it is better off staying
    away from it, otherwise, you could really mess up and cost your printer a lot
    of money.

  body: "Automation is generally the biggest reason to still use batch systems like
    XyVision. Although batch systems are actually capable of a high degree of typographic
    control (at least the systems that are holdovers from the early days of electronic
    typesetting, I'm not so sure about some of the newer ones), the features that
    keep them in the running these days are their ability to handle huge amounts of
    work in a small amount of time -- as long as things are set up well. They're not
    designer-friendly software, but awfully useful for companies that produce a lot
    of material without a lot of custom layouts.\r\n\r\nInertia is a problem with
    companies that have never stopped using these systems as galley composers, since
    they're often left with tons of data that can't be converted to other software
    without effectively starting from scratch. These big systems really come into
    their own, though, when you use them to process text with standard markup languages
    (like SGML or XML), rather than their own proprietary coding.\r\n\r\nThe learning
    curve for building formats and workflows is awful (which is why they work better
    in places that don't need a lot of design customization or manual intervention),
    but once you've built your typographic and pagination specs, things can go very
    fast.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I work on a similar system (Miles 33) that has a terrible
    user interface, its own proprietary command language, and an endless list of maddening
    quirks, but we can bury all that underneath a workflow that lets us take a dump
    of marked-up text from a database and spit out hundreds of pages of tables, math,
    text and artwork with little need for the person processing the books to know
    how it's all put together.\r\n\r\nThat set-up might require a huge amount of work
    for someone else ahead of time, but then formatting and laying out the books themselves
    is pretty straightforward for everyone else, and the marked-up data can be more
    easily used for other purposes.\r\n"
