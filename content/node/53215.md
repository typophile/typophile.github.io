    lettering should at least resemble letters, otherwise it's a code, and not script[ure]\u2026\r\nIt
    seems \"fonts\" have nothing to do with that kind of illustration treatment, as
    much as I appreciated Lee Schultz Antionette and Salome.\r\nIn a similar vein,
    I think Missionary by Miles Newlyn is a good example to indicate an extreme limit
    you can reach if you wish to write a text meant to be read, and not decoded, after
    which letters become mere illustrations.\r\n\r\nFor example, which has been the
    idea behind making Restraint as a typeface? Id' be curious to know\u2026\r\nIt's
    a pattern generator in the form of a typeface, and it helps by mechanizing the
    ornamentation elements, but it's no longer a typeface."

    letters? :) I asked 'who says script fonts should look like calligraphy', since
    Victor Curran said that that is a rule. A script -- or maybe <em>lettering</em>
    is a better word -- only has to look like calligraphy if the designer wants it
    to. \r\n\r\nThat they <em>should</em> look like calligraphy is a rediculous claim/rule,
    in my opinion, which is proven by Marian Bantjes and Aron."

    did it with vectors, it was a half a day's work. and i did in in flash :D, so
    its not really professional, for example the hairlines aren't shrinking, there's
    only a gradient on them :)\r\n(don't ask why flash and not illustrator... i didn't

  body: "Quincunx: You don't understand what I meant: they are letters, but they are
    used in a way that becomes more illustration than word, so the text meaning is
    the second thing you get.\r\nI am not saying this is not good, I just said, as
    you agree, that this is lettering illustration, or art, as in English art seems
    to be used for any graphic endeavor.\r\n\r\nThe fact that one might like it or
    not is not the key, since taste may be pretty deceiving.\r\nI have tried to incorporate
    such abstract treatments in typeface design, and I find more interest in this
    than the simple use of letters in illustration, that's what I mean.\r\nBut of
    course, being an illustration, it depends on the whole essence of its communication
    as desired by the author.\r\n\r\nFor example, I prefer a lot \xC1ron's typeface
    [[http://flickr.com/photos/mil3n/|Milen Serif]]. I would make alternative attempts
    to re-evaluation of the weight distribution (especially on [c], [s] and [y]),
    but the alphabet it is done with great consciousness, and the layout choosen to
    present it and choice of colors are immersive and successful.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    Victor Curran comment did not make much sense.\r\n\r\n<cite> I am happy whatever
    you call it. </cite>\r\nLOL\u2026 :=)\r\n\r\n<cite> Turn the script into a font.
