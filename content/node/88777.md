  words like \"KNOWLEDGE\" or \"POWER\" in all caps spelled out with letters made
  out of 3D metal, mechanical parts, like rulers, gears, and the like? If so, I'd
  love to know who made this or at the very least what company the ads were for. I
  seem to remember them being for a car company, but I am not certain. Any help would
  be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks and happy new year!\r\nDavid"
