  peeps?\r\n\r\nI could collect address, randomly match people up (or within the same
  country when possible for shipping price reasons) and then we could all get something
  awesome for under $10.\r\n\r\nOkay sign ups will finish on Saturday Nov 29th and
  then I'll PM you your person and their address.\r\n\r\nGifts should be mailed before

    idea! ;^) What else would you expect from me? When it gets that silly / sardonic
    you can be sure I'm putting peeple on. For the curious, \"gripe-o-phile\" is a
    pun on typophile I extracted from Ray Larabie. I made him coin it by saying \"tripe-o-phile\"
    to him one day. The pair of us compete to see who can be the silliest and get
    into the most trubble.\r\n\r\nNow Ricky, I'm disappointed in you ;^) We haven't
    had a joke from you yet. That's hardly in the festive spirit is it? Wot say Ricky?

    couldn't find any handwriting fonts but I am just now (even as we speak) pushing
    a new font of mine called Jabberwub out the door. One thing I did find under the
    sofa was ten minutes. I must have left them there on Friday when my friend Amanda
    stopped by.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jimi_quad_6353.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    couldn't think of any really great ideas so I played around with the Jabberwub
    font and clicked on buttons and things and generally just&#8212;you know&#8212;used
    my imagination. I suppose there is a vague kind of a theme going there, if 2009
    can be called a theme. All I can really tell you is that I would have been stuck
    for something interesting to post if it wasn't for layers and gradients and hard
    lite.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jimi_08_5401.gif]\r\n\r\nSo I
    am thinking of giving away release copies of Jabberwub to typophilers as free
