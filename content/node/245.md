  body: Hello Petro <BR> <BR>I like the white spaces you leave  <BR>in combination
    with the B/W &#34;purity&#34;  <BR>and the usage of types &#40;FFMeta?&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Though i would need to see how the label  <BR>looks on the bottle &#40;if
    not applying it on <BR>a photo of the bottle -at least displaying  <BR>the label
    at the width of the bottle&#41;. <BR> <BR>I would go for the second version  <BR>&#40;with
    the element of branches&#41;, but  <BR>I would recommend the branch-lines to lose
    <BR>their weigh gradually, as if they come out  <BR>of a pen...i think they will
    compine  <BR>more &#34;natural&#34; with the main line. <BR> <BR>Sorry for the
    poor usage of english &#40;i am greek&#41;. <BR> <BR>christos

  body: hi peter <BR> <BR>i&#39;ve been inmerse in the wine world since i was a kid
    and i can say that here you have an original personaity for a wine label. <BR>
    <BR>allthough i would also love to see it in a bottle, the final one, because
    is not only the the proportions that matters, also the shape of the bottle <BR>
    <BR>i also like the second one, it reminds the vid and handcraft in the wine.
    <BR> <BR>Do you have an estimative price it would be sell? <BR> <BR>CG

  body: Christos, nice to see another Greek in here.  Though I am not full greek I
    still carry on the name and the flavor.  Good point on the lines getting thinner.
    <BR> <BR>Cristian, thanks man.  I am excited to work on this cause I don&#39;t
    there will be another bottle on the market like it.  It will sell for around $40.  Kinda
    steep, but the wine is actually very good.  Steeped in jasmine flavor, with a
    nice earthen woody flavor.  Anyways, thanks for the feedback.

  body: I prefer the first without the tree branches, but I might be won over to the
    second if the branches were less &#39;wispy&#39; and /or they had more of a grapevine
    feel &#40;they look like cow-parsley to me at the moment&#41;

    may be up to me. <BR> <BR>if we do go with the trees, I think they will need some
    tweaking &#40;i.e. thinning out the terminals was a good idea Christos&#41;. <BR><img

  body: The bottle will be black glass? You won&#39;t see the color of the liquid?
    I prefer the single undulating line, not the tree version. Reminds me of a grape
    vine. I also prefer the white line to the grey line, unless you make the type
    grey also. The starkness, however, of the white is nice, especially against the
    black background. --- Perhaps a little nitpicky, but I think you need to work
    on the small paragraphs of type, you have some serious gaps and rivers. I&#39;d
    add some letter spacing, not a lot, to the roman weights.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: i like the concept of trees, but i feel like you nee to simplify.  i think
    you should continue to explore the trees.  if i had to choose between the three
    as they are, i would select the first one.  no grey.  red, white, and black is
    very sexy.  i like the lettering.  its striking and makes it look expensive.  keep
    up the good work. <BR>gfox

    Don&#39;t know what this is called, but it&#39;s a kind of latex thing. <BR>Like
    a bottle of Makers bourbon only not dripping. Elegant! If so, dip it in black.

    and was choosing a bottle I would go for the second white label, simple and elegant.
    The branch lines are a  wonderful touch. The black ones make me think of contemporary
    European film posters. Why? Who knows. but they do. '
