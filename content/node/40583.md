body: "I found it interesting that a sign on the picture on the [[http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2008/01/04/todayspaper/index.html|front
  page of yesterday's New York Times]] from Barack Obama's campaign was set in Gotham,
  so I started wondering what fonts all of the candidates are doing.\r\n\r\nHere are
  some general trends I noticed by looking at their websites. All but Edwards use
  serif fonts for their names in their logos. Clinton and Obama use Gotham pretty
  much everywhere, and their font usage seems most standardized of all the candidates.
  Edwards also uses Gotham, but his site uses other fonts too.\r\n\r\nI doubt it's
  a coincidence that Clinton, Obama and Edwards all use Gotham, but no other candidates
  seem to have decided to use the same font as each other. (At least two others are
  using Helvetica, but that could have been a coincidence.)\r\n\r\nI was hoping to
  find cooler trends, but I didn't. Maybe someone else who's bored will find this
  interesting and look for some more.\r\n\r\nI'm also wondering whether anyone has
  <em>consciously</em> taken the quality of the design of the candidates' campaign
  materials in selecting whom to vote for."

  body: Obama's is the most interesting and thoughtful logo by far, but yeah, his
    materials use Gotham just like the others. It's too bad that the candidates' campaigns
    would miss this opportunity to set themselves apart. Still, as much as I'm opposed
    to homogeneity, Gotham is not a bad choice for a U.S. candidate. It's much more
    American than Helvetica.

    hadn't really looked at Avenir before, but now I have, and it looks like that
    to me too. The most obvious difference is in the punctuation. I was surprised
    that a font designed for GQ magazine would also be used for a presidential campaign,
    but I hadn't realized how popular Gotham is."

    were still many campaign signs up, so we got a good look at the variations.\r\n\r\nI
    got to say, that EDWARDSO8 all jammed together, does not work very well. Particularly
    in the 1-color version we saw, white type on a deep blue field. Speeding by it
    on an Interstate or puttering by it down a farm road, it was not reading very
    well. Cheryl asked: \"Does it say 'EDWARD SOB' \"? Last time out, when Edwards
    was running for veep with John Kerry, the signs looked like they were pimping
    for a guy named \"Kerry Edwards,\" and in fact some reporters dug up folks with
    that name. Now it looks like someone's mad at some guy name Edward who is a son
    of a b****. No wonder this guy lags today in New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nObama's O logo
    looks amazingly like the logo for a church which I assume to be a conservative
    Christian church in northern Iowa. Drove by in bad weather too fast for a photo.
    But I know it pre-dates O's run for the top job.\r\n\r\nOh, well. Just keep in
    mind that type and design are not very good criteria when you must decide for
    whom you shall vote.\r\n\r\npowers"

    elect political parties as well. What typefaces they use I dont know from memory,
    but a couple of parties are [[http://www.sp.nl/|SP]] (a condensed Univers or Helvetica),
    [[http://www.pvda.nl|PvdA]] (apart from the logo, not very consistent. I've seen
    multiple typefaces, like Scala Sans) and [[http://www.cda.nl/|CDA]] (also doesn't
    seem to be really consistent, apart from the logo). But I'm sure they all have
    official typefaces for their visual identity.
