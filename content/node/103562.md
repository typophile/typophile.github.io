  Type Founders and Michael Doret are proud to announce the Release of Dark Angel,
  a \u201Cblackletter/hybrid\u201D font. This font had its genesis in a logo sketch
  for the Anaheim Angels baseball team\u2014thus its name.\r\n\r\nType purists may
  be appalled by the lack of adherence to traditional forms, but the font should be
  seen as only \u201Cin the spirit of\u201D blackletter, and attempting something
  that hasn\u2019t been seen or done before\u2014something that feels traditional,
  yet at the same time fresh and perhaps unexpected."
