  body: Thanks for your reply. But I think it's a little bit different than News Gothic
    because it has more rounded corners/edges. I'm not very good with fonts and the
    terminology but News Gothic font didn't seem to be a perfect match to me. But
    again thanks for your interest.

    would have expected to find."

    was inspired by this style of draftsman's hand lettering.

  body: "Gotham rounded would work to the same degree Bryant would, but these letters
    look monospaced, so maybe they would be too wide. Lex is onto something. There
    HAS to be some typeface based off of the Leroy set. I have a broken set laying
    around my house, I've always wanted to use it.\r\n\r\nIt leaves a little to be
    imagined. For those who haven't seen one of these, when you scribe these letters,
    the \"reverse italic\" look is corrected with the tool (this isn't my set):\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3245-15L_04_3879.JPG]"

  body: "Hehe! I rescued my old Amstrad CPC464 last year. It's gathering dust in the
    spare room now. It works fine, though the Amstrad monitor is unusable -- it has
    a double image. To be honest, I don't know what to do with it.\r\n\r\nI'm glad
    I don't have to load tapes on my present machine!"

  body: "Hi, thanks all for your kind replies. I think I'll stick with this Bryant
    font. It's the most similar font (the letters on the keyboard are also the same
    font). I suppose that the \"Leroy set\" or the \"standard draftsman\u2019s hand
    lettering\" that you mentioned aren't digital vectorised fonts that i could use..
    I don't seem to know a lot about these font issues anyway :) Thanks all again
    for your help.\r\n\r\nolho: I have a CPC 464 too. Lots of dust and scratches but
    I never thought to dump it :)"
