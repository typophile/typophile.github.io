  body: Chesh and Stephen and Yves must be asleep, watching CNN or this one&#39;s
    too easy for them. <BR> <BR>Ryan, it&#39;s modified Compacta or a derivative.
    <BR> <BR>The G and the E are slightly different, but could&#39;dve been modified
    easily. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/compacta/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/compacta/</a>

  body: I did a search and initially thought Anzeigen, but the &#34;S&#34; seems way
    different. More than a simple modification anyway. I hate to say it, but the closest
    things I think I&#39;ve seen &#40;based on the spine of the S&#41; are Bitstream&#39;s
    Square 721 and &#40;good god&#41; Impact.

  body: BJ, I don&#39;t watch CNN. It&#39;s government sponsored censored and sanitized
    non-news. They won&#39;t allow you to see the <i>real</i> horror of war, nor the
    countless spontaneous protest actions all over the globe. You don&#39;t see the
    outrage, the disbelief, the despair of the people when confronted with a loose
    cannon on a global scale, armed to the teeth, foam at the mouth, looking around
    yelling &#34;Anybody else wants some?!&#34; <BR> <BR>In protest of this unacceptable
    breach of international law and act of wanton aggression which threatens world
    peace, I hereby suspend my activities on this forum for the duration of the conflict.
    Which won&#39;t last more than three weeks, believe me, after that George W. Bully
    will probably resort to the use of tactical nukes. Mark my words. He doesn&#39;t
    want a new Vietnam. <BR> <BR>Stop watching CNN. <a href="http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/"
    target="_blank"> Read this for a change</a>. Bye for now, I&#39;ve got some protest
    actions to attend to. <BR> <BR>Peace <BR> <BR>Troubleman <BR> <BR>P.S. And every
    morning when listening to the news I get sick to the stomach when they broadcast
    excerpts of this lying hypocrite&#39;s speeches. Because your leaders <i>do</i>
    lie to you.
