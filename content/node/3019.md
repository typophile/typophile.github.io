  body: It&#39;s TheSans, from LucasFonts. Probably the Light weight. This face used
    to be part of FF Thesis &#40;along with TheSerif and TheMix, but it looks like
    Lucas de Groot is marketing it himself these days. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com"
    target="_blank">http://www.lucasfonts.com</a> <BR> <BR>It was quite the trendy
    face a couple of years ago, at least in American publication design and corporate
    branding. Now there are exponentially more humanist sans available, and I don&#39;t
    see it nearly as often -- or maybe it&#39;s just lost its novelty.
