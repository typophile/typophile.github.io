  body: The main reason to do it is to make the files smaller and thereby make the
    download &#40;and the upload&#41; go faster. Not absolutely necessary, but a good
    idea. <BR> <BR>However, with older Mac font formats &#40;i.e., font suitcases&#41;
    you must do it or you will loose font data. This is because Mac files are in some
    cases a bit more complex than those on other platforms &#40;UNIX, Windows, etc.&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Mac files can have two parts, called the data fork and the resource fork.
    The data fork is just like a plain file on any other platform. The resource fork
    is unique to the Mac. Some Mac files have only a data fork &#40;usually files
    created by word processors, drawing programs, etc.&#41;, and those can be transfered
    to other platforms with little trouble. However, system resource files, such as
    fonts, have most of their data in the resource fork. Unfortunately, if you try
    to move such a file to another platform, that data is lost because the other platform
    doesn&#39;t have any way to access or use the resource fork part of a Mac file.
    The result is that it gets stripped out. <BR> <BR>The solution is to use StuffIt.
    When you compress a font file with StuffIt, all the compressed data is stored
    in the data fork of the StuffIt file, so it can be moved to and from other platforms
    with no ill effects. When StuffIt expands the file, it restores the data and resource
    forks to their original state. <BR> <BR>With Mac fonts, the files that are affected
    are font suitcases, which can contain either TrueType fonts or screen fonts &#40;for
    PostScript Type 1 fonts&#41;. OpenType fonts are not affected.

    which is why you need to Stuff Mac font files before putting them on a web or
    ftp server.'

  body: If you have not invested in Stuffit yet and are working on macOsX, you can
    use File | Create Archive of...  instead &#40;right button on mouse&#41;. It makes
    zip files that owners of Stuffit can expand and PC users too.

  body: Which works better anyway. I just had a problem with stuffit files sent to
    a service bureau. I then sent them archives &#40;.zip&#41; and the files were
    fine. argh!

  body: That didn&#39;t make sense. I was simply saying that I&#39;d &#34;stuff&#34;
    stuffit and use the OS X archive feature.
