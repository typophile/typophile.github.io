    the annual report of the Heidelberg group that they publish in PDF format on their
    website? \r\n\r\nROTFL. The sum was either 50 or 60 million dollar, I don't remember
    the details, I'm sorry. I'd have to look it up again. \r\n\r\nA."

    <A HREF=\"http://www.ta.com/\">TA Associates</A>  <A HREF=\"http://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/pr_display.aspx?year=2007&pr=306\">announced</A>
    that they are planning to offer an IPO - so all manner of financial details would
    been submitted to the FTC, and are thus public record. Anyone who's not looked
    at the numbers must either a. not be interested and has more interesting things
    to do, or b. has been sitting under a rock somewhere for the past few months.
    \r\n\r\nAlso TA has \"$10 billion of capital\" so whatever they paid I think they
    can afford it. A more interesting question, is who here is planning to buy a piece
    of the action once the shares go on sale? ;-)"

  body: Monotype had to borrow the money to be able to pay the purchase price, i.e.
    Linotype was bought on credit.

    case. What makes the business aspect of this deal of special interest?

  body: "Bojev, \r\n\r\nI think it is interesting because it gives an estimate on
    how much money there is \"in the font business\" altogether. Linotype is a major
    player so its acquisition price gives a reasonable basis for estimations of other
    companies. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: I would assume what we are talking about here is the value of all the intellectual
    property carried forward into the future plus "good will" generated by the name.
    This compared then to the sale of Berthold is interesting. I wonder what are the
    implications for an individual designer in selling a font outright to a company?

  body: "I really could care less about what the exact amount it cost Monotype to
    buy Linotype because its not what it cost them- its what it costs me and you.\r\n\r\nA
    side effect of the merger was an increase in the price of postscript type from
    $21 to $24... and the reason is... to pay for the crown jewels- Helvetica???\r\n\r\nAlso
    I believe Linotype had a program in which the more you purchase the more you save:\r\n\r\n21
    for 1\r\n\r\n19 for 3\r\n\r\nsomething to that effect- now its gone!\r\n\r\nThere
    were other perks too- certain families of type were lower in price than Monotype-
    of course that has been moderated... I'm okay with that though.\r\n\r\nBut I'm
    still curious if Monotype's price increase mandated that their distributors do
    the same (FontShop for instance) or did these distributors decide to do it on
    their own?\r\n\r\nBut I shouldn't grip too much... I try to purchase only OpenType
    PostScript. Its more money but you get more features or versatility so the $29
    or $35 is worth it to me.\r\n\r\nMikey :-|"

  body: "<cite>I wonder what are the implications for an individual designer in selling
    a font outright to a company?</cite>\r\n\r\nNone. For any of the big players,
    10% of the fonts in their library make 90% of the revenue (or perhaps it's even
    more extreme than that). For Linotype, the overwhelming majority of their revenue
    comes from designs that are at least 35 years old. So the total value of the entire
    Linotype Library tells you very little indeed about the value of a *new* typeface
    that you are trying to get somebody to buy today.\r\n\r\nI agree with Adam and
    Si as to why this stuff is interesting, and I certainly recommend reading Monotype's
    filing with the SEC. (Not the FTC, btw.)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hoovers.com/free/co/sec.xhtml?ID=155441&Page=1&Sort=D\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"
