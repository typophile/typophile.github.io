could you write me some opinions about my new text type project, please?
It is Italic family which includes left and right leaning roman and italic version.
As a first I wanted to design just left leaning but later I add right variant.
I&rsquo;m the most interested if the left roman version is enough readable for you as a text type.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.
Slavka</p>

		<div class="commentbody">First off: nice work!
The left slanted roman is definitely readible although it might be a bit straining on the eyes for longer texts. It&rsquo;s quite hard to estimate how it&rsquo;d effect legibility in the long run, but I guess going against the grain of the reading flow it might end up becoming tiring.
Still I have to say it looks really good &amp; would definitely be able to serve certain purposes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So this thing doesn&rsquo;t have an upright at all,
and each of the two slanted cuts has an Italic.</p>
<p>Some people would call this gimmicky. I myself
am a big fan of finding alternative methods of
emphasis, so I&rsquo;d love to see this explored more.
For example you could use a «direction»&rsquo;s own
italic for mild emphasis, and the italic from
the other «direction» for stronger emphasis.
Combined with different weights, the «emphasis
palette» would become quite rich.</p>
<p>In terms of the character of the design itself,
the main thing I&rsquo;m wondering about is whether
the backslant italic should actually be more
than just a mechanical job; maybe it would be
cool to make it reflect chirography, for example
the arches could be <em>flatter</em> than the Roman&hellip;</p>
<p>However the Roman I would actually consider
making less chirographic; for example I&rsquo;d make
the serifs symmetrical. This would further
distinguish the Romans from the Italics.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;g&rdquo; is wonderful - maybe make it <em>slightly</em>
less top-heavy. I&rsquo;d raise the tittles, and make
the ascenders a bit taller.</p>
<p>BTW, I checked out your (?) site
<a href="http://www.gd2.cz/cs/page/slava-jevcinova/minus-five-degrees">http://www.gd2.cz/cs/page/slava-jevcinova/minus-five-degrees</a>
and I&rsquo;m seeing some nice original thoughts. Keep it up!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You know, for the longest time I thought right-leaning
Italics were not&hellip; kosher :-) for Hebrew. For one thing
they&rsquo;re totally not in its sister-script, Arabic. I think
I simply didn&rsquo;t want to believe it&rsquo;s OK (being an anti-
Latinization myrmidon) and I dismissed the various
examples of it (like the El-Al logo*, if memory serves)
as deluded. But I&rsquo;m not sure any more, and if I were to
bet the house (not that I&rsquo;m a gambler) I think these days
I&rsquo;d put my money on &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK&rdquo;. Maybe since Israelis are
very tech-oriented they&rsquo;ve moved even further from
handwriting than Westerners.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hmmm, if it looks gimmicky I&rsquo;m sorry. But my concept was to try design left leaning text type. From the beginning it was just left leaning, but then I added also right slanted. I was considering also about upright italic / classic roman, but I&rsquo;m worry that in this case people will not notice the Italic so much. So I don&rsquo;t know, maybe I will add it later.
Especially I like combination left roman with right italic :)</p>
<p>For sure I plan more weights, but unfortunately right now I have just this one.</p>
<p>I quite don&rsquo;t understand your idea about italic&rsquo;s directions. Do you think that I should make more version??? or what did you mean?</p>
<p>&ldquo;symmetrical serifs &quot; - so you think that I should leave out smoothly flow into stem from one side? I did it because I wanted to keep in roman also some element from handwriting…</p>
<p>hmmm…</p>
<p>Btw, this web side is from my University and you saw my first typeface :)
but it&rsquo;s not finished yet, maybe I will post some new improvements later :)</p>
<p>thank you so much &hellip;hhp</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, it&rsquo;s not that it <em>looks</em> gimmicky. It&rsquo;s just that
one has to think about Design, and what you&rsquo;re trying
to achieve. Making something simply because you can
isn&rsquo;t Design. In fact one Famous Designer who has made
an upright-Italic pretty much said he did it because he
had always wanted to make one&hellip; It didn&rsquo;t seem to matter
that the style is pretty much useless for emphasis (as you
state yourself).</p>
<p>Now, you might instinctively know that it&rsquo;s a good idea,
but to make it usable to others you will have to figure
out <em>why</em> it&rsquo;s a good idea; that&rsquo;s the only way to develop
it fruitfully.</p>
<p>Italic directions: well, it would be nice to have multiple
slants (or even a slant Multiple-Master axis) but I think
you should start with one for each direction. Just make
sure the amount of slant is enough, but not too much.
This depends mostly on the intended usage size, which
is a product of weight, vertical proportions and spacing.</p>
<p>The Roman&rsquo;s serifs: yes, forget handwriting. Don&rsquo;t willfully
shun its <em>products</em>, but don&rsquo;t treat it as some sort of ideal.</p>
