body: "I am trying to use the DTP Naskh OT font in InDesign. The problem we are facing
  is that the tops of the vowels do not align flush to the top of the text box. There
  is a small amount of white space that remains at the top of each page. This is not
  a problem with the Lotus Linotype font which is always flush to the top.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help. Much appreciated.\r\nAbdur"

  body: In InDesign you can set the distance from the top of a text block. If a particular
    font does not behave as you wish using the default setting, go into the 'Text
    Frame Options' dialogue (Object menu) and adjust the setting for the individual
    text frame(s).
