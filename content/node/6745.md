    of similarities to The Streets. Both have unapologetically <BR>thick British accents

    target="_blank">BAD II: The Globe</a> <BR>is one of my fave albums of all time.
    &#40;In a lot of ways The Globe  <BR>was a post-punk reaction to hip hop - but
    that&#39;s where the  <BR>comparison to The Streets ends.&#41; <BR> <BR>Bah, enough
    pontification, just listen to it.'

    to the shitkatapult site. It&#39;s great! I like the playlist feature quite a
    bit. I&#39;m going to hook that up at work, too.
