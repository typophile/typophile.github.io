  body: "ofcourse you can, but then it will treat as a single layer and you will not
    be able to send something back or in the front. For that you have to   break the
    overlaps.\r\n\r\nIf you want to trace\"super\"..here is the trick...start tracing
    it from back.here is a rough trace of the same.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/super_1_6414.jpg]"

  body: "You have to divide the paths where the strokes are overlapping, in order
    to make the effect of something on top, or below.\r\n\r\nThen zoooom in very much
    so you see detailed info where the \"overlaps\" are and edit.\r\n\r\nThere can\u2019t
    be one closed path, but 5-6 of them in order to make the illusion work properly."
