body: "I'm organizing all the JPEGs I have of old type, adding tags as I go. The function
  that I'm trying to achieve is that through the filter function of Bridge be able
  to sort out the documents that contain the specific letters that I need so that
  I later can bring them into Illustrator and vectorize them.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, here
  is an example: Let's say I have a bunch of old woodtype samples, and I got the word
  Entertainment in one file and the word Literacy in another and Kong in the third.
  I need letters for the word ELK, and ointment. My current system is as follows that
  each tag is just for one letter. I.e E, n, t, e, r, a, i, m, (since Entertainment
  contains duplicates) and I've done this across all files.\r\n\r\nUsing this system
  I can go into the filter and checkbox the letters that I need, however the process
  is incredibly time-consuming. So when I'm in bridge I can just checkbox E, L and
  K and I can see with which files I can construct this word. The same principle applies
  to ointment.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm the only one with a system for this, however if I'm
  not alone I'd love to hear how you guys solved this. Hopefully there is another
  method I can adopt for this."
