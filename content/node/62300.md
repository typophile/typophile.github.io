body: "I just received an email from iStock Photo that they are going to be offering
  logos. They are looking for designers to submit logos that will be sold for one
  time use. They are offering $5 per and an additional $5 if they meet their goal
  of 10,000 approved designs.\r\n\r\nI initially saw this and thought about submitting
  a few however, upon thinking about it I think this is a pretty terrible concept.
  I know that there are plenty of sites out there like \"$50 Dollar Logo\" but iStock
  is a pretty popular site and I hate to see things go this way. It just undervalues
  the work of graphic designers and makes it harder to sell our services. I also question
  how well font licensing will be upheld.\r\n\r\nI personally hope that the design
  community does not support this venture and iStock doesn't receive enough submissions
  to move forward with this (although I'm sure they will)."

  body: I think you're right. How could anyone design a logo without knowing what
    it's going to be used for? Won't they all look really generic? I don't imagine
    many professional designers or serious clients would be interested in this kind
    of setup. iStock can't possibly expect to get quality for $5. It'll be interesting
    to see what happens.
