  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm working on a font I started a few years ago that is based on handwriting from the 1800s. My experience with various alternate figure style is pretty limited, but I don't see a style or feature to fit what I want to do. Hopefully I can figure out how to get an image to show. Basically I want to create figures that when triggered by the dollar sign / numbers / period come in like superiors. I write checks like this and have seen samples of it handwritten, but don't know if this is done typographically. I haven't started building any feature code yet, so I'm very open to suggestions. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Would you show us the contrasting form? You could of course create two fonts for this - one with your 'monetary figures' and one with lining or tabular or what ever you like. Or you could build a single font with stylistic alternates built in. The question is - who do you want to be able to access the feature. People who have CS3 or people who just have whatever ships with MS or Apple or Linux? If it's the later than a separate font makes some sense since the 'feature' will be more accessible. Another angle is that you could force it's use in an OT font when a $ sign ( or other currency sign) is present.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was thinking of doing this as a strictly OT version. So my thoughts were to code it in where a dollar sign followed by a string of number followed by a period would be followed by superior figures. That way it wouldn't come up in unwanted places. I'd have to experiment to get the feature code to work, but there is probably a way. I'm not sure if this would go under a calt feature or perhaps even a case feature. Stylistically I think it works for a handwriting style font. I just have the original CS of creative suite, but I think if I get it to work for that CS3 would also. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">»Calt« or »Clig« would be the right features. But I believe you have to check every possible number of digits seperately. 
»$ a.bb«, »$ aa.bb«, ... , »$ aaaaaaaaa.bb« and so on. 
And of course this would all fail, if the user would use a different currency symbol or would add commas or spaces.

Or are you be the only person using this font?

I think I would be more convenient to use a stylistic set and apply it locally with character styles. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">So would I have to create 100 superior figure ligatures ( .00 .01 .02 ... ) to follow the period? I suppose that could work, if there isn't a simpler way. Maybe then »Clig« would be the way to go. I probably wouldn't carry the dollar side beyond a thousand as the cents would become a bit trivial. It is after all a display font as opposed to a corporate or math font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Since the only real ligature I would use for the cent side would be for an even dollar amount (00), could I create a special set of Monetary Superiors? Then I would do a series of dollar / figures / period to get the first @msup, and follow that by another @msup substitution?


sub dollar @figure period @figure' by @msup;
sub dollar @figure @figure period @figure' by @msup;
sub dollar @figure @figure @figure period @figure' by @msup;
sub dollar @figure @figure @figure @figure period @figure' by @msup;

sub @msup @figure' by @msup;
sub zero.msup zero.msup by zero_zero;

@figure = [ zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ];
@msup = [ zero.msup one.msup two.msup three.msup four.msup five.msup six.msup seven.msup eight.msup nine.msup ];

This seems like it would work along the same lines as fractions are composed.
Of course, I have no experience with creating fractions either, so excuse me if this makes no sense.

		<div class="commentbody">Good point that you would only need a single "00" ligature, if that's really what you want. You don't want small numbers for everything? And if you have numerators or superiors that suit the purpose, I think you could just use those, e.g.

<code>sub period @figures' by @figures_superior;
sub period @figures_superior @figures' by @figures_superior;</code>

(I'm leaving out extra context, like preceding currency and numbers, like Georg wrote, but you can put as much of that in as necessary.)

One thing to keep in mind is that different countries write such figures differently -- such as using a comma where we in the U.S.A. use a period. Your font could very well end up annoying people in Europe! In theory, you could make different contextual substitution rules depending on the particular currency symbol that's used, but in my experience, these tricky kinds of things usually end up getting too complicated -- and one ends up making the substitution discretionary (i.e 'dlig') instead of on by default (i.e. 'liga').

It seems like there might be a more clever way to do all this, but rarely does such cleverness come to me immediately.  :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks all.
I should do more research on all this. I know this could easily get overly complicated, so I will try to figure out the wider scope of things so I don't go "annoying people in Europe". I just started working with OT less than a year ago and its a big learning curve for me, but I'm getting there. If all goes well this will be my 3rd OT font.

I'm very grateful to be able to use the Typophile forum. Its a wonderful resource with a fabulous group of people.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd echo Chris' suggestion to use superior figures.

calt
sub dollar @figures period @figures' by @figures_superior;
sub dollar @figures @figures period @figures' by @figures_superior;
sub dollar @figures @figures @figures period @figures' by @figures_superior;
and so on...

For Canadian French, you would need to put the dollar at the end, because that's how people talk, n'est-ce pas?

An interesting idea, Stephen. </div>
