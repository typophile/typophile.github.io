  body: "I would say that this trademark was created to be stamped, and was manufactured
    from a drawing or cast piece of artwork. At first I thought the T was supposed
    to be a steer's head, but maybe it's just a flared T-shape. Interesting that the
    numbers are not reversed, as I would have expected for a punch die, and that may
    mean the image was reversed, or this is used for stamping something thin, and
    read from the opposite side.\r\n\r\nWhat is it for, if you know?\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "I'm sure the image has been mirrored. It's for stamping the tangs of pocket
    knives.\r\n\r\nWe know what company made the knife (Schrade because the stamp
    came from the old Schrade plant after they went out of business) but not who Schrade
    made the knife for. Over the years there has been a good bit of discussion about
    this tang stamp by some very knowledgeable knife people on several different knife
    forums. So far, no one has been able to nail down the brand.\r\n\r\nTrying to
    think out of the box, I thought I'd take a shot at maybe the 'WT' was a font instead
    of a logo. A lot of folks think the 'T' is a steers head. I think it's just a
    stylized 'T'. We're all guessing in the dark.\r\n\r\nThanks for your response."

    came up with the answer within 4-1/2 hours of the original posted challenge. It's
    a logo for Trustworthy Hardware Stores.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trustworthy
