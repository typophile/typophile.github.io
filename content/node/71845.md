    I have Updikes \"Printing Types\" and it would help to narrow the century and
    nation for each. The Latin does not necessarily mean these were Italian, because
    Latin was often the language of scholars, regardless of nationality.\r\n\r\n-

    It appears to me that the French one was in the era just after Garamond, and during
    the time of Granjon and Fournier. There are a few digital foundries who have made
    a business of reviving old typefaces from copies of old books, and perhaps you
    can find some that approximate your samples. From what I read it was rare until
    the 18th century for European printers/foundries to print specimen books, and
    apparently typefaces weren't named, but rather associated with the printers who
    used them. Updike speaks of typesetting and typefounding as being trades that
    were often not considered elite, and it was common for printers to use whatever
    type they could find. Copying other designs was evidently common.\r\n\r\nThe German
    sample was even harder to learn much about because Latin/Roman types were not
    as typical to German Printing, where Fraktur and Schwabacher styles were more
    in fashion, according to Updike.\r\n\r\nI cannot pretend to be an expert on antique
    types just because I have these books. I have not studied them. I think you really
    need an expert on antique printing to try to answer this question.\r\n\r\n- Mike
