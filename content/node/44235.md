body: So I guess most received a recent Veer promo piece that is all secret society.
  There's a cthulhu figure in the seal on the front and fun puzzles etc. inside. So
  I was walking by and looked at it upside down and it looks like Yosemite Sam. Am
  I seeing things?

    since it came up, that\u2019s the coolest promo piece I\u2019ve seen in a long
    while. Whoever designed that thing and got a client to sign off now has more nerd
    cred than anyone save Bill Gates. Of course, maybe I\u2019m not the best judge
    seeing as how I named my thesis typeface after a character in <em>The Dunwich
    Horror</em>."
