  body: Where did that 'r' come from, Kevin? It doesn't appear in any of Klim's examples
    and the PDF doesn't show any alternates.

  body: "It's  there, you have to go to page 28 (and the following pages) of the PDF,
    to Founders Grotesk TEXT.\r\n\r\nI didn't dig too far into the code of the Academy
    of American Poets page, so perhaps they used the non-text version of Founders
    on that one character to get the less ornate |r| seen in the sample. Or maybe
    they had Klim customize the web font for them to align with their logo design.\r\n\r\nFounders
    Grotesk Text is also where you will see the more open |c| that's visible in the
    sample.\r\n\r\nAnd I just noticed that the sample has an |i| with a round tittle.
    That I can\u2019t find anywhere in the character set. Also custom?\r\n"

  body: "Thanks very much for the detective work. I'd gone to Klim's site but didn't
    go far enough...it was the /t/ that I didn't see in the samples I set...\r\nBut
    my first guess was Founder's, so I give myself partial credit..."

  body: "Riccardo, I use a Firefox plugin called Type Sample to identify CSS-styled
    type on websites.\r\n\r\nAnd cpkc, you are quite welcome. Thanks for the mystery
    to solve. There are enough differences between the text and standard versions
    of Founders Grotesk to see why you were skeptical, and the logo itself mixes and
    matches fonts within the family (the |r|, for example; plus, it uses a custom
    dot over the |i|).\r\n\r\n"
