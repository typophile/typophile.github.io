  you like to see, what would you visit?\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm asking is because that's
  just happened to me (and some co-workers)! We have been given some money and time
  to go on a study trip. Preferably Europe, but New York could be an option. The catch
  is, that it has to be relevant for our work (we're all teaching graphic design,
  typography, photography) :-)\r\nSo, any ideas? \r\nThanks!"

    exotic, but still on the fringe of Europe: Yerevan, Armenia. You'll see a lot
    of it in four days (on foot), and it's a place very into \"visible language\"*,
    with Latin, Armenian, Cyrillic and Arabic (Farsi) all over the place**. You'll
    see how fonts, logos and visuals in general can get distorted***, or improved
    upon. Plus it has good food and cool architecture, it's inexpensive, and most
    of all very hospitable and safe.\r\n\r\n* http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/sets/72157621930145718/\r\n\r\n**

    most interestingly, the Armenian script seems to stride a very\r\nfruitful border
    between the familiar and the alien to a Latin-scripter:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4130109730/\r\nIt's
    exactly the sort of thing that can inspire and liberate a designer.\r\n\r\nBut:
    what time of year?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    York is of course tons of input and crazy, but 4 days might really be too short
    (mind the jet lag).\r\nBut given that you're open to discovering something a bit
    off the proverbial beaten path, I actually (whole-heartedly) recommend Armenia
    too! I traveled there last summer, and found it very stimulating in terms of visual
    input: indeed, familiar (and hospitable) enough to not make one feel out of place,
    yet foreign enough to be surprising and inspiring. It's an amazing, rich culture
    to discover; and seriously obsessed with letters too. (Plus your bag of money
    will definitely last longer than if you come to Switzerland\u2026)"

    there's Barcelona. And Beirut.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
