  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nI have been subscribing to OpenSource podcasts for a while
    now, and heard the cursive show yesterday. Your contribution was right on, and
    you came across as knowing what you were talking about. (Regular typophile readers
    know better, oh course!)\r\n\r\nI always get the feeling that the host Christopher
    Lydon can't wait to interject his comments whether he understands the subject
    matter or not. When you were speaking about OpenType and contextual substitutions,
    I could sense Lydon's brain freezing.\r\n\r\nGood Job.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "Thanks James. I was concerned about talking too much about OTF features because
    the audience might get lost.  It was a live show so I didn't know what to expect
    from the host.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\nPS: \"Regular typophile readers know better, oh
    course!\"\r\n\r\nLOL!! Yes they do :-)\r\n"

    also noticed him not follow up on a question when he figured out what the answer
    was in his mind. :) Thumbs up, Chris! Congrats!"
