  beginner with Fontographer (I only installed it today)\r\n\r\nBasically I've taken
  an existing font and made all my tweaks in Illustrator (Upper and lower case, bold
  and light) I've then converted the existing font into a ttf and opened it in Fontographer.
  \r\n\r\nNow all I want to do is transfer my characters from Illustrator into Fontographer
  and have them exactly match the size/baseline etc, I haven't changed the proportions
  of the font in Illustrator so I'm hoping that I won't have to mess with the kerning.
  But When I paste them in they are huge and I'm struggling with the scale tool and
  lack of rulers/guides. Is there a way of importing an eps, or just replacing a character
  without having to manually scale each one? Or have I missed something and gone about
  this all wrong???\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nPaul"

    Descender of 0. Then, in Illustrator, place spacers (here shown as blue lines
    with a 4 pt. stroke) to match the highest point and lowest point of all the characters
    in your font. This way, all of your characters will import at the same relative
    size.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elegant-lichte_4829.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    usually import five to seven characters at a time, delete the spacers, then Clean
    Up Paths, Correct Path Direction, Remove Overlap, then Cut and Paste into the
    correct slots.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more housekeeping to be done once all of your
    glyphs are placed, but let's leave that for another day. This ought to get you
    started on the right track...\r\n\r\n"

    - I'm an illustrator, not a type designer, and I have no interest in being one.
    But when I get chance to sit down with a nice cup of tea and a packet of digestive
    biscuits I will read the 525 page manual, thanks."
