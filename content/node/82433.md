  there a source where I can look for precursors to digital type fonts, i.e. designed
  for Microsoft or Apple?  Specifically, I am looking for typeset that was similar
  to the digital versions of Sylfaen, Old Bookman and Constantia, but that was available
  to offset lithography typesetters in the early 1990's.  Can you help?\r\n\r\nAn
  image is attached.  It is the main lettering in the company names that I am interested
  in.  \r\n\r\nThank you very much."

  body: "Bookman is older than offset litho, so it probably doesn't matter that -although
    it's somewhat distinctive- there are some fonts that come close. The other two
    however are: newer than 1992; and very distinctive, at least given decent repro
    fidelity.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
