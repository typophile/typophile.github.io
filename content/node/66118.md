  to join this forum, not only to observe but also to learn more about the world of
  typography! \r\n\r\nI am from Sweden so please bare in mind my fairly incomplete
  language skills.\r\n\r\nI this a good start on the forum is to show a thing that
  I have done and with some luck get one good thought or two from you guys. I am talking
  about my very own logotype for my name, also soon to be my website and all-around
  self-brand. \r\n\r\nTake a look and tell me what you think. I was aiming for a sleek
  and rather elegant feel. Also I tried to have complexity in mind and avoid to advanced
  techniques. As you see it's rather simple. Too simple maybe? Does it need a background?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in Advance! "

    I lurk and keep my opinions to myself, but welcome.\r\n\r\nLooking at your mark,
    I do enjoy the RL ligature in both the red and the gray. However, the rest of
    your name is awkwardly placed. There is a huge disconnect between the first letter
    and the rest of your name, so that you can't read it. If I were you I would take
    it out completely or set it beneath the mark. I don't think the logotype is too
    simple, nor does it need a background."

    the logo.\r\nI'm not sure about the hairline spacing between R and L. I think
    you should make it big as the stem or remove it."

  body: "Thank you for the comments! You both mentioned the small text and I really
    agree. I will redo that part. About the hairline spacing, I'm not sure taking
    it away will improve the look but maybe enlarge it to the same size as the stem
    would be a good idea. \r\n\r\nWill post an update in short!"
