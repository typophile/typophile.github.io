  Du Roi typeface and the calligraphy of that period? i read on some books that Romain
  Du Roi departed typography and calligraphy. i want to know more about this argoment.\r\nThanks

    commission confirm what anyone can ascertain: the designs follow in detail the
    handwriting of Nicholas Jarry, who worked around 1650 as the calligrapher for
    the Cabinet du Roi. This history leaves us no other choice than to view the \u2018romain
    du roi\u2018\u2013the type\u2013in terms of the handwriting of Jarry.\u201D (page
    17 of the English edition)\r\n\r\nIMHO design histories that try to insert specific
    breaks between type design are writing are dumbing things down for the sake of
    creating a simple timeline. The real history of type and writing is more like
    dozens of threads that weave through each other as type design and writing influence
    each other. The more time you spend studying it the more confused you\u2019ll
    get."

  body: "Do you read French, Davide? <em>Le Romain du Roi: la typographie au service
    de l'Etat, 1702\u20132002,</em> edit by James Mosley, is the best work on the
    subject. It introduces all the elements that contributed to or influence the design
    of the new type, including the lettering or royal medals, Jarry's calligraphy,
    and of course Grandjean's role as punchcutter. In this larger context, the famous
    plates showing the rationalised design of the committee seem to me a product unto
    themselves, largely leapt over by Grandjean's interpretation, which refers back
    much more directly to Jarry's writing and to other existing models.\r\n\r\nThe
    book includes a nice reproduction of a page of formal writing most probably by
    Jarry. Interestingly, the style of italic shown is closer to Fournier's type than
    that of the Italique du Roi."

  body: "James, I don\u2019t know where in Paris you could rely on picking up a copy
    of the <em>Romain du roi</em> catalogue of 2002.\r\n \r\nI know that Frits Knuf
    Antiquarian Books, specialists in printing history with a big stock, have some
    copies. They are in Vend\xF4me. (Vend\xF4me is not very near Paris, but I\u2019m
    told it is a nice town in some splendid countryside \u2013 and that name Vend\xF4me
    has irresistible echoes of Excoffon and the Fonderie Olive. Maybe a trip for another
    time. They would certainly supply it by post.) I think that the Mus\xE9e de l\u2019imprimerie
    in Lyon, where the exhibition took place, still has copies available, too.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the type itself, it is surrounded by myths. (No, Phil Meggs, it was not a
    crime punishable by death to copy it.) But it is certainly the first known type
    for which a separate \u2018design\u2019 was made. In fact the design seems to
    have begun simply as a rational way of making letters, before the idea for the
    making of a new type was launched. But then the two projects seem to have developed
    together. One of the other myths is that it was the punchcutter, Grandjean, who
    took the ideas of a set of non-practical technicians and made the design work
    in typographical terms. But it was Fournier le jeune, a professional punchcutter,
    who started that one. From what we have of the written record, it is clear that
    Jaugeon, one of the technicians directing the process, was frustrated by Grandjean\u2019s
    inability to work accurately from the model in front of him, and in fact they
    dumped his first punches as unusable. The later ones were better.\r\n\r\nThe calligrapher
    who comes into the story was not Jarry (who was certainly one of the great names
    of the century) but Allais. Gerrit got that wrong. Jean-Baptiste Allais published
    a writing book in about 1680, and the committee looking after the project agreed
    to follow some of his designs for specific italic characters. One of the distinctive
    things about French calligraphy of this time is that the lead-in stroke of letters
    like i, m, n and so on have flat, rather \u2018roman\u2019, serifs, making them
    look a bit like a \u2018sloped roman\u2019. That feature did not get into type
    with the romain du roi, but Fournier used it fifty years later in his \u2018new
    style\u2019 italics, and later so did Firmin Didot. And that French flat serif
    also turns up in, of all places (it\u2019s a complicated story), the italic to
    Times New Roman. I have a feeling that I have written about this in an earlier
    thread (maybe someone can find it) so I will stop here.\r\n"
