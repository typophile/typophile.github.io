  by [[Alexander Lawson]] and I already feel like I want to know more about the few
  begining chapters. On page 48 it reads \u2014it may be observed that Morris had
  an extreme deslike for the roman types of his own era, types that indeed lacked
  individuality and character\u2014 Although it may be difficult to know which typefaces
  Morris desliked the most I deplore that they aren't any illustration of typefaces
  of that era. A novice like me could see (by comparison) what people like Morris
  where trying to acheive with their revivals of Jenson types.\r\nI also confusingly
  understand (assume) that in around 1900-20 they were no contemporary metal type
  based on the works of Italian renaissance typographers like Jenson or Aldus. Is
  it only the work of the likes of Morris and Rogers that put these types back in
  fashion. And if it is the case, when did these typefaces came out of fashion?\r\n\r\ncheers"

    a part of the end of the pre-raphaelite movement obsessed with living their lives
    through rose-colored glasses. could this be attributed to his socialist tendencies
    as well? he idealized about the making of the book and yearned for years gone
    past. they were, in essence, kicking against the pricks of the industrial revolution.\r\n\r\nIn
    some ways, Morris and his peers repeated what had happened with the Humanists.
    They had found manuscripts which they assumed to be in the ideal style and adopted
    it. Perhaps it wasn't just the type which Morris had a dislike for, but the entire
    era in general. "

    of Beatrice Warde, who did much of the initial research on true origin of Garamond

  body: "Tiffany's right - William Morris and the Arts & Crafts movement were a backlash
    against the industrial revolution in England at that time (and remember he died
    in 1896, so perhaps was mainly active 1860 - 1880?) but certain of Morris's arguments
    were being reiterated by Edward Johnston and Eric Gill still 50 years later. \r\n\r\nI
    think Morris's chief objections were against the gaudy chintz of the Victorian
    display faces (all those elephantine fat faces and mad inverted serifs), falling
    standards of press work, and an eventual bastardization (by way of Scotch Roman,
    perhaps) of the modern letterform - long debased from the clarity of Didot and
    Bodoni in the preceding century. In the 1880s the steam-driven press and new chemically-derived
    inks and papers were only about 40 years young; these inventions had a great (Morris
    would say detrimental) effect on the speed and finish of jobbing printing - almost
    the reverse of what consideration of ink and paper had accomplished for John Baskerville
    in the 1740s. \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, the humanist faces of Jenson and
    Aldus were superseded by the old style faces of Garamond and Granjon within a
    century of their creation; the new faces produced in the 17thC were more forgiving
    for the vagaries of the press work - uneven pressure, damp paper, sticky inks
    etc. Over the next two centuries the press work got better, machine tolerances,
    inks and paper all improved and as a result the typeforms became thinner and finer;
    but it was these very qualities that suffered so much in 'bash it out' mentality
    of printing in the industrial revolution. Type often got damaged and loose in
    the bed of the press, wrong sorts were commonly substituted and the whole job
    subsequently badly impressed on poor quality stock. Morris's arguments, I think,
    were as much about time, skill and care being exercised in any calling, not just
    printing.\r\n\r\nFor contemporary metal type based on the works of Italian renaissance
    typographers 1900-20, you could check out MF Benton's Cloister Old Style (1897),
    Frederic Goudy's Kennerley (1911) and Bruce Rogers Centaur (1914). These were
    influenced by the private press movement, of which the Kelmscott Press was just
    a part. You might also want to look at the work of the Doves Press (Doves Roman),
    the Cranach Press and the writings of Stanley Morison."

    in France some decades before Morris, against the Didone (Modern) type style which
    had conquered all and covered the typographic landscape with a frigid blanket
    (and made reading a pain in the eye sockets in the process).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Sebson\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I can explain this as well as need be. Part of
    the problem re: Morris is that the idea of continuum that we enjoy today was simply
    not there in the late 19th century. Just prior to Morris starting his press, Kodak
    brought out film for photography. Morris was greatly influenced by Emery Walker's
    investigation of Renaissance and medieval type forms that he captured with the
    camera, and that he found in library and personal collections (note that public
    access at that time was not like we enjoy). It may seem very strange today but
    this is extraordinarily significant. Without the camera there is no visual representation
    of the typeforms of previous periods. And, in the late 19th century, typography
    can be considered, at least in terms of composition, likely the worst imaginable.
    Anything from a previous period would have looked beautiful compared to it.\r\n\r\nSo,
    with Morris and his Arts & Crafts inclination, there is an investigation, and
    a revival. And there is an across the board initial revival based on his influence,
    which is sometimes called the false revival, and then there is the later 1920s
    revival institigated by Monotype, where the truer forms, Bembo, Centaur, Poliphilus,
    are brought to fore.\r\n\r\nThe first writer on printing, Joseph Moxon, had no
    clue, 200 years after the invention of printing, what the evolution of typeforms
    had been. It is easy enough for us to discern this but likely not for anyone prior
    to the visual representation provided by the photograph.\r\n\r\nI've been amazed,
    that this idea of the photographic representation of  letterforms, and its consequences
    upon the accepted notion of continuum, has never been discussed in any technical
    literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nGerald"
