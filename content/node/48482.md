  what it is, but Transport Heavy appears to be closest candidate. Still though, it\u2019s
  different - any ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GreekRoadSigns_5655.jpg]"

    I think <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/transport_bold/?sample_text=Athens%20Sea%20Front">Transport
    Bold</a> is your best candidate. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/traffic_type_spain_ot_std/?sample_text=Athens%20Sea%20Front">Traffic
    Type Spain</a> is also similar.
