  to learn. Hopefully someone here can help me out.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm creating
  a small-ish booklet as a student project, probably no more than ten pages or so
  (possibly less). I'm hoping to create a cover that wraps all the way around similar
  fashion to [[http://www.printingtips.com/print-term/t--2561/wrap-around.asp|this]],
  but first I have a few questions. Is this technique possible and does it have a
  technical name other than a 'wrap-around cover'? If it is possible, how best to
  bind the pages (I was thinking saddle-stitch for so few pages)? Also, how do I allow
  for the thickness of the pages as the cover wraps around? Can gsm be converted in
  to millimeters of thickness?\r\n\r\nFinally if you have any resources you'd recommend
  for someone new to printing techniques, I'd be glad to hear them! They'd be a great
  help.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

      this is a one off, and I'm not even sure which paper stock I'm using yet.\r\n\r\n@JamesM:
      I hadn't thought of that! Thanks for pointing that out, you've saved me a lot
      of time.\r\n\r\n@Oldnick: True, since the last post I've started planning my
      designs for an A5-sized booklet so that shouldn't be a problem. All I need to
      do is find some suitable paper-stock for the cover.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your
      help guys!"

    directly. The bulk of paper will depend as much upon the density of the fibers,
    not just the weight. You\u2019d need to get your printer or paper supplier to
    provide the caliper or ppi specs for your particular sheet.\r\n\r\nBut since this
    is a student project, and probably a one-off, Bert\u2019s suggestion is probably
    easiest: trial and error ;-)"

    you already know this, but you can't have a 10-page saddle-stitched piece.  Must
    be in multiples of 4.\r\n\r\n2 sheets of paper folded and saddle-stitched become
    8 pages, 3 sheets become 12, and so forth.\r\n\r\n"

    like 5\"\xD78\xBD\"\u2014or half a standard letter-size sheet\u2014would be easy
    and cheap to produce: three sheets for the content and one for the cover. I offered
    a 5\" width to solve your creep  problem: simply face-trim the book to the 5\"
    width after it's assembled and there's no worry about having your slip showing."
