    the Logo:\r\n\"The corporate logotype of The Economist has evolved from the gothic
    lettering used on the cover of the first issue, published in 1843, to the box
    device designed in 1959 by Reynolds Stone, a British engraver and typographer.
    It now incorporates a font from The Economist Typefamily, a typeface created specifically
    for our use.\"\r\n\r\nThe typeface:\r\n\"The Economist has used a specially designed
    family of typefaces since May 1991. Development work focused specifically on how
    the new type family would respond to electronic transmission and different printing
    conditions at The Economist's seven international production sites. In our recent
    re-design a new typeface, Officina, was introduced for cover headlines and all
    navigational information. Ecotype, The Economist\u2019s main typeface, was also
    redrawn to make it easier to read. If you would like to buy a copy of our type
    family, or if you would simply like to find out more about it, please go to Agfa
    Monotype's website\"\r\n\r\nA truly great publication! They document everything,
    the style guide regarding the use of English language within their articles is
    also pretty special: \r\nhttp://www.economist.com/research/styleguide/?CFID=13548251&CFTOKEN=61264069\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps. Peace!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
