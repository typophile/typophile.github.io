  body: ' I found that there is an interesting background you made for this font.
    I like it. Also you can see it just like molecule things. Have you set the kerning
    yet? Cause it seems a bit hard to read when you set the text sample above, though
    it is a display font. Like the &#39;L I&#39; that can be misreading to &#39;U&#39;.
    Well that&#39;s it for this time. I&#39;ll make more suggestions next time. I&#39;ll
    just wait for the other to critique. Great! Keep up the good work! <BR> <BR>&#43;ep&#43; '

  body: ' This is really very pretty. The colors, the bones, everything. The strong
    grid constraint seems to be getting you in the case of some letters, and this
    type of thing has been done before, but maybe not as tastefully. I think this
    design will be popular - you might even make some money from it! <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: BTW, you might try selling exclusive rights to this design to Tech-TV&#42;
    or Cingular&#42;&#42;. You&#39;d need to write a nice dry piece of snailmail,
    and send it to the right people, like maybe the creative directors? <BR> <BR>&#42;

  body: ' I have to say I like the patterns more than the  <BR>type itself. There&#39;s
    an elegance in the patterns  <BR>that doesn&#39;t come through in the glyphs  <BR>themselves...
    Maybe that&#39;s the juxtaposition  <BR>you&#39;re going for? '

  body: i think that the final result doesn&#39;t show an important aspect of rotation,
    that is movement. <BR>i say it because the final result of many of the typos are
    too ortogonal. <BR>i like more the J,G,V.  <BR>

  body: It took me a moment of thought to recognize the dollar sign. My eye just saw
    <sup>x</sup>x and I had to examine the symbol closely to figure out the intended
    paths. Perhaps a vertical stroke would be preferable.
