body: "This spring Type@Cooper's public workshops offerings have some new classes
  in Cooper Union's Letterpress studio. \r\n\r\nBeginning February 3rd, Nick Sherman
  will teach a 5 week evening course \r\nhttp://coopertype.org/curriculum/workshops/chromatic-wood-type-design-printing-and-history
  \r\nStudents will look at historical examples, analyse forms, design a some letters,
  and print their designs from laser cut wood type on a Vandercook press. If you love
  type, color and printing this will be very fun. \r\n\r\nBeginning March 17th, Sumner
  Stone will teach a 5 week evening course\r\n http://coopertype.org/curriculum/workshops/designing-printing-modern-letters
  \r\nwhich follows a similar model. Students will look at historical examples, analyse
  what makes a Modern typeface design tick and design their own type using these parameters.
  Printing will be done from polymer plates on the Vandercook presses...also very
  fun and potentially colorful. \r\n\r\nLater in April Ken Barber and John Downer
  return to teach some brush lettering and sign painting techniques. More on those
  later. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chromatic_Wood_Type_6180.jpg]"
