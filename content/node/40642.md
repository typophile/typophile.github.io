  close, unless it's an exact replica. \r\n\r\nWe have original type samples from
  c1924\r\n\r\nanyone have any ideas of where i can find these digitally to buy? \r\n\r\n\r\nfound
  the \"new\" distributors of the old Ludwig & Mayer here (scroll down to ludwig)\r\n\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/ext20.html\r\n\r\n\r\nalso
  found a great pdf resource on Stempel here (for those that read German) and noticed
  the reform on pg4\r\n\r\nhttp://www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/ChronikStempel.pdf\r\n"

  body: "well, for those interested we got to the bottom of lux by erber. it's owned
    by a design/type house in the netherlands that has yet to produce it digitally.
    They were impressed by our type specimen books, but wanted lots of $$ to produce
    it digitally. \r\nobviously akzidenz is a son of the reform by stempel, but the
    s in bold never ceases to impress, and i've not seen it elsewhere. erber grotesk,
    which was released with lux, is produced by linotype and more appropriately translated
    by hoefler in the form of verlag. \r\n\r\n"

    on Typophile.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how they \"own\" the design. Isn't this out
    of copyright by now?"

    own Lux by Erbar?\r\n(not sure how they can own it?)\r\n\r\nSteve Jackson / Red
    Rooster have a cut of Phosphate which is part of the same Erbar/Lux family. Not
    sure if they ever made a cut of Lux, might be worth checking.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure
    if Verlag is a translation of Erbar - they are similar - but that's about all.
    Do you mean inspiration for Verlag?"
