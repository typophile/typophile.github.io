  <BR> <BR>Stories About Book Design.&#42; <BR><a href="http://www.aigalosangeles.org/events/archives/000479.php"
  target="_blank">http://www.aigalosangeles.org/events/archives/000479.php</a> <BR>
  <BR> <BR>Anne Burdick <BR>Simon Johnston <BR>Tracey Shiffman <BR> <BR> <BR>It was
  a great event. We saw some great work and heard some really inspiring stories. <BR>
  <BR>So, I wanted to know what the typophile community thought were some of the best
  designed books out there. Not &#34;design or typography books&#34;, but books on
  other fields or subjects.  Also who do you think is doing good book design out there.

  body: 'Joshua -- <BR> <BR>James Montalbano turned me on to <i>Trout and Salmon of
    North America</i> by Robert J. Behnke, designed by Charles Nix. Nix is a great
    book designer and this is a marvelous book. I don&#39;t own it and I haven&#39;t
    spent as much time as I&#39;d like looking at it, but it&#39;s on my list. <BR>
    <BR>Percolator, out of Minneapolis, also does some nice book work. <i>A Degree
    of Mastery: A Journey through Book Arts Apprenticeship,</i> by Annie Tremmel Wilcox,
    is one of theirs that I enjoyed. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>I was lucky enough to find a copy of &#34;The Shaving of Shagpat&#34;
    in New Orleans. Check Alibris.com and the other out-of-print book sites. <BR>
    <BR>Barry Moser&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0670887978/102-1729795-5384160?v=glance"
    target="_blank">Bible</a> is also very nice. <BR> <BR>I also think Mr. Lew should
    have mentioned the <a href="http://www.kentlew.com/GardenBirds.html" target="_blank">book</a>
    he features on his website. I&#39;d like to get my hands on a copy.'
