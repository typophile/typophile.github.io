  body: 'Nice collection! But you realize there are perhaps dozens of different typefaces
    on these tickets, right? <BR> <BR>Anyway, I&#39;ll cherry-pick some of the obvious
    ones: <BR> <BR>- Copperplate Gothic &#40;Burnside, Strand Theatre, Center Theatre&#41;
    <BR> <BR>- Metro &#40;Avon Theatre&#41; <BR> <BR>- Cheltenham &#40;Queen Theatre&#41;
    <BR> <BR>- Goudy Bold Italic &#40;&#34;Drive-In Theatre&#34; on Burnside&#41;
    <BR> <BR>- Nobel Bold &#40;&#34;Good only date sold&#34; on Burnside&#41; <BR>
    <BR>- Avant Garde Gothic, squooshed &#40;Columbia Drive-In&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    sure there are various weights of Monotype Grotesque, Spartan/Futura, and some
    of the older slabs, like Rockwell, Stymie or Memphis in the mix, too.'

  body: 'Marc: I think you nailed a good many of the fonts. I&#39;ll chip in a few
    more guesses. <BR> <BR>&#34;Nobel&#34; is basically a Kabel clone, and was released
    in 1993. The most likely sans-serif font for these tickets is Spartan, as it was
    very common in newspaper printing. <BR> <BR>The &#34;ADMIT ONE&#34; on the Ocotillo
    ticket is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=ADMIT+ONE&amp;search%5Btext%5D=rockwell">Rockwell</a>.
    The Burnside ticket has some <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Drive-In+Theatre&amp;search%5Btext%5D=goudy+bold+italic">Goudy
    Bold Italic</a> on it. <BR> <BR>There are a fair number of instances of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=24&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=TILTON+THEATRE&amp;search%5Btext%5D=alternate+gothic">Alternate
    Gothic</a> for condensed sans text. The Columbia ticket stands out as inauthentic
    in its use of Avant Garde. Many of the numbers are in various American Gothics.
    <BR> <BR>Serial number printing machines tended not to use real fonts. You can
    use Alternate Gothic in a pinch, but the numerals of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontboutique/noga/">Noga</a>
    look a bit more authentic to my eye. For the more condensed variants, you may
    also have luck with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hollandfonts/pacific-standard/">Pacific
    Standard</a> or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/standard/condensed/testdrive.html">Standard
    Condensed</a>. <BR> <BR>Looks like a fun project. Best of luck!'

    is essential. It&#39;s <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_crash.html" target="_blank">http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_crash.html</a>.  <BR>
