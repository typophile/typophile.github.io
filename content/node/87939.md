  body: A better link to the font is <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100028&path=head">to
    the publishers, H&FJ</a>. It's $99 for two fonts. If you're going to use it for
    something commercial, just buy it.

    project (or a very tight budget, you could look at Chunk too:\r\nhttp://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/chunk"

  body: "This is one of the few font packages (if you call 2 fonts a package) from
    H&FJ that sells for less than three figures. And if you only want only one font
    from H&FJ, you usually have to buy a mega-package.\r\n\r\nIf H&FJ want's to keep
    their fonts for the well heeled, so be it. Just on GP, I'd get Chuck."

  body: It's all relative. If you buy a family, (which makes good sense for most of
    their typefaces), H&FJ prices are quite reasonable, less than most premium foundries
    if measured by the font/style.
