[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tweaking_5692.jpg]
<em></em><em></em>
Nevertheless this post presents a different approach. After 2 months of designing the Simplease logotype I started to become a little worried about this &ldquo;beating a dead horse thing&rdquo;. Next thing on my mind was let&rsquo;s go back to the drawing board &ndash; mentally as well as physically.
<em></em>
Actually I wanted to communicate simplicity &ndash; the current approach kind of communicates usualness. Allthough I was never doubting the connection between both of them, at some moment I started to believe that there must be a more distinctive way of telling the story. The first thing that came to my mind was a more &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; type. Maybe one that&rsquo;s based on a grid-system. That was about the time when I started to sketch.
<em></em>
It took some time to realize that a very strict grid-system would just be a little too &hellip; hmmm &hellip; strict. To get an impression of existing typefaces that might convey the message I initiated a &ldquo;widespread&rdquo; search and after a 30 minute long search-odyssee I found Neo Sans. It turns out to be perfect. Everything I had to do was kerning. It&rsquo;s everything I was dreaming of. The grid-shaped letters have such pleasant roundings &ndash; it&rsquo;s both, simple and pleasant.
<em></em><em></em>
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simplease_leo_5001.jpg]
<em></em><em></em>
I especially like the subtle connections between the letters of &lsquo;ease&rsquo;. Finally the awkward negative space of the self-made version is gone. Maybe I&rsquo;ll put my hands on the &rsquo;s' and the upper part of the &lsquo;a&rsquo; &hellip; just trying, because I think it&rsquo;s already great.</p>

Seemed like before I was able to read it as a nice combination of &ldquo;Simple ease&rdquo; much better. Now I can&rsquo;t help but read &ldquo;sim please.&rdquo; Perhaps it&rsquo;s the dot-less i&hellip; to me, without it, there&rsquo;s more weight on the right side of the word (my eye interprets the descender on the p as some kind of seperation).</p>
<p>Neo Sans does seem less strict. It feels extremely child-safe, actually; follows the current corporate re-branding trend of having no sharp edges. The more I look at it, the more I see that decapitated i as a small cap thrown right in the middle of s and m, interrupting the lowercase.</p>
<p>Then again, I could just be weird. I love the name you got going, I understand the logic behind it perfectly and I think it&rsquo;s creative.</p>

<p><strong>@David Boni:</strong> The reason why I decided to go with a lowercase &rsquo;s' was, that I wanted to bring in more geometry. As a result of this, I also dropped the tittle. Both decisions lead to the impression of having an optical middle &ndash; the &lsquo;l&rsquo; respectively &lsquo;ple&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s exactly the area where the words &lsquo;simple&rsquo; and &lsquo;please&rsquo; are blurred together. I want to emphasize those two words instead of &lsquo;simple ease&rsquo;, simply because many austrians don&rsquo;t know the word &lsquo;ease&rsquo; &ndash; most of the tested persons were able to see a connection to &lsquo;easy&rsquo;, but many don&rsquo;t know the &lsquo;ease of use&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s why we decided to make the &lsquo;ease&rsquo; kind of a bonus, for those who know the &lsquo;ease of use&rsquo;. For all the others we have the word &lsquo;simple&rsquo; which is easily associated with the industry (User Experience Design), and we have the word &lsquo;please&rsquo;, which is one of the first english words people learn in school. As a result we hope to get a very memorable name.</p>
<p>I agree that it reads &lsquo;sim please&rsquo;, but actually that&rsquo;s also how it&rsquo;s pronounced by most people. Nevertheless I will try a dot on the &lsquo;i&rsquo; to see how it works &ndash; thank you for this comment.</p>
<p><strong>@epsilicon:</strong> Thank you for your exquisite font-list. I&rsquo;ve already tried some of your suggestions a few months ago, when I started to set the letters in different typefaces. Anyway, some of them are new to me and so I will definitely take a closer look at those. Thanks for your work, I appreciate it a lot.</p>

<p>According to your advice I have reworked the &rsquo;s' &hellip; very gently. It definitely looks better now &ndash; great observation.</p>
<p>Regarding to your comment on the second &lsquo;e&rsquo; I have to mention that I checked them and both of them are the exact same character &ndash; maybe the wider &rsquo;s' made it look wider as well in the previous version? Would you suggest to make the second &lsquo;e&rsquo; a tad narrower?

The leading of the copy was adjusted to meet every third line of the standard baseline. <a href="http://www.simplease.at/stefan/simplease_offer.pdf">Download the PDF-Version.</a>

<ul>Our corporate typeface is Univers (Light)</ul>
<em></em><em></em>
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12_column_grid_4005.png]
<ul>The layout is based on a 12-column grid</ul>
<em></em><em></em>
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/golden_sections_6116.png]
<ul>The page consists of 2 'golden' elements</ul>
<em></em><em></em>
To have a pleasant column width for the copy I decided to divide this part into 2 different columns. The right one is for the text and the left one provides meta information to improve scanability. The longest line within the copy contains 64 characters.
<p>The idea was to design a very simple layout that suits our identity and considers all the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; of typography. To design something like a &lsquo;user-experience&rsquo; I decided to provide the reader with meta information which dramatically reduces the effort of finding the needed information &ndash; let&rsquo;s just call it a more efficient way of reading and rechecking the content. Nevertheless this meta information is not meant to be headlines and so the text of a document always has to be coherent without the need of reading the meta information. (for all native german speakers: right now it doesn&rsquo;t &ndash; this is just some sort of placeholder text)</p>
<p>Any kind of feedback would be well appreciated and very helpful since I would like to carry on with the rest of our CI.</p>
