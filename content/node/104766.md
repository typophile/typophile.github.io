  network connections between Internet nodes and it is tentatively called <em>The
  Peering Project</em>. The following is a symbol I am currently iterating over -
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ikebana-3_5775.png]\r\n\r\nand the black
  and white version -\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ikebana-2_4510.png]\r\n\r\nI
  am my own client, so life is hard and I need external opinions. \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>For
  one, if it resembles anything existing (I can't think of anything). \r\n<li>For
  two, if it's too generic or, preferably, unique enough to be memorable. \r\n<li>For
  three, what's your first impression of it?\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThanks"
