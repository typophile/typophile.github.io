  a tutorial or such on creating a way for users coming to my site to \"Try before
  you buy\". \r\n\r\nSomething like this where the user can test the font in the browser:
  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trybeforeyoubuy_5512.png]\r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  know how this is implemented or what it's called?\r\n\r\nCheers"
