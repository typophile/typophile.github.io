    print and infographics work looks great; I am reminded of a recent Gestalten book,
    [[http://shop.gestalten.com/books/echoes-of-the-future.html|Echoes of the Future:
    Rational Graphic Design and Illustration]]. It looks like a very promising start.'

    based in London you can check it out in [[http://www.magmabooks.com/|Magma]],
    I know that they currently have it on display in the Covent Garden branch."

  body: "I would consider not setting the descriptions of the briefs all in uppercase.
    \r\n\r\nIn your infographics project you need to align the figure icons.\r\n\r\nIn
    the interviews for the Perfect Brief, there is something strange happening with
    the text, the lowercase r appears smaller than the x-height. You might also try
    a narrower measure and/or ranging the text left. There are also some spelling
    errors in the flow chart which do not give a good impression.\r\n\r\nI would also
    edit the illustrations section.\r\n\r\nOverall there are some strong graphics,
    but I think weeding out some of the weaker work would serve you better.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "The r quirk in the interviews is an idiosyncrasy of Helvetica's on-screen
    hinting.\r\n\r\nI too would consider maybe using a different color for the briefs,
    instead of all caps.\r\n\r\nIt seems a bit strange to me to do a portfolio in
    the form of a blog, with comments etc. I would try to disable some of the bloggier
    features of Wordpress. Also, you should get your own URL that doesn't say Wordpress.\r\n\r\nAll
    that said, I do really like some of your work, particularly the layouts in the
    project on poverty."
