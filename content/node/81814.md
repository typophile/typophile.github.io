body: "hi, \r\ni hope you can help me, i\xB4m analyzing some fonts and i have no idea,
  why these results are like they are. i alnalyzed the stroke contrast of urw baskerville
  and itc garamond. i take the width of the vertical stroke of the lowercase \"n\"
  and the hairline in the middle of the \"e\", divided the results, so that i get
  the stroke contrast. I hope still that point i didn\xB4t make any mistake.\r\n \r\nthe
  stroke contrast of the garamond is getting higher per growing stoke thickness (sorry
  my english is not the best) garamond light 1: 1,87. garamond ultra: 3,33. ok that
  make sense to me, there ist not so much space, the letter would getting to dark,
  therefore the stroke contrast is getting higher.\r\n\r\nbut at the baskerville the
  results are contrary: baskerville regular 1:3,5. baskerville ultra bold 3,17. and
  that\xB4s the point i don\xB4t unterstand, why is the stroke contrast getting less,
  which optical cause has it?\r\n\r\ni hope you can help me and understood my lously
  english.\r\nthank you very much,\r\njuli"

  body: One thing to remember is that when those fonts were originally designed (by
    Garamond and Baskerville) there was no bold, light, ultra, etc, just regular and
    (maybe) italic (and variations between designs of different size type). So the
    changes in contrast you are talking about were the result of decisions made in
    the 20th century (probably) by someone else.

    over the years.\r\nSo an effect observed between any two instances may not be
    typical\u2014especially when the Garamond is ITC's!\r\n"

  body: "Interesting. \r\n\r\nHow about averaging the measurements of different cuts
    of Baskerville and Garamond to see whether this holds true more generally?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    you should look at the regular, rather than the light, weight of Garamond. Light
    weights need to keep a certain amount of weight on their hairlines or risk drop-out."

  body: "First of all, don't use the bar of the \"e\" as a reference - different fonts
    do different funny things there (and sometimes it's not even straight and of uniform
    width). And actually, the more places you take samples from the more accurate
    your results.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
