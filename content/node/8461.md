body: 'BUILDING LETTERS: TSUNAMI EDITION <BR> <BR>Jim Richardson of UK the based Building
  Letters charity projects received a call on January 4 from Rathna Nathan of Reading
  University, who contributed to the 2004 edition of Building Letters magazine. She
  was in Sri Lanka when the Asian earthquake struck on Boxing day, and was calling
  to suggest a special edition of Building Letters to get funds to help survivors,
  the fishermen in North Tamil and Southern Sinhala get back on there feet, and able
  to make a living again to support their families, and provide food for their communities.
  <BR> <BR>In order for this special Building Letters edition to help, we need your
  contribution to get it published by the end of the month. It means that we need
  all the help that we can get to put the magazine together and make it available
  for sale. <BR> <BR>As a core element of this issue, Max Kisman suggested to ask
  type designers, designers, artists and illustrators to produce one flower each,
  that will be published in the magazine as a respectful tribute to the people who
  have lost their lives, and to the power of nature. <BR> <BR>The image of the flower
  or fleuron should be suitable for black and white implementation as part of a font
  as well as a separate color illustration for inclusion in Building Letters magazine.
  The size of the illustration would be in the ration of 2:3 &#40;10 cm x15 cm, 4
  x 5 7/8 inch&#41; <BR> <BR>THE DEADLINE FOR THIS IS 14TH JANUARY, <BR>AND WE&#39;D
  BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD LET US KNOW YOU WILL BE CONTRIBUTING.'

    <BR> <BR>Just one thing: Are you in fact limiting this to Sri Lanka? If there
    must be a limited geographic focus &#40;which can admittedly make sense&#41;,
    I think it should be Aceh, maybe even just Meulaboh. <BR> <BR>But in any case,
    the best of luck on this. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    Aid III is just now live at Myfonts.com <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/fontaid/"

    IHOF have donated each top seller &#40;Cezanne and Durer Caps&#41; for the month
    of January 2005. 100% of all sales of these fonts through the &#34;Font Aid&#34;
    foundry will go to Tsunami relief efforts. Myfonts is also donating their portion
    of all sales as well as expenses to route the money to appropriate charities.
    I would suggest that other foundries donate their top selling font to this effort
    for one month. Please contact John Collins at myfonts if you wish to join in this
    group effort.  <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Richard Kegler

  body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've designed the BL III magazine. Everything is ready to
    print. Unfortunately it seems there are no money to print and distribute the magazine.
    There was no progress since the beginning of October 2005, so I asked Jim to remove
    a link to my studio from the www.buildingletters.org website. Jim actually redirected
    this site to Fleurons Of Hope Font Aid project. It looks like the BL project is
    over. I am little bit disappointed not only because I've donated the design and
    typesetting, but mostly because the issue is very appealing and full of interesting
    texts by Nick Shinn, Fiona Ross, or Max Kisman, to name a few. It also contains
    all fleurons submitted to the charity font; many of ornaments are published in
    color.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cover.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2-3.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/14-15.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/24-25.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/30-31.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/42-43.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/56-57.jpg]"
