  with this interesting (at least to me) quirky little serif. I'm no font expert -
  not even a font neophyte, really \u2026 so, I google searched \"font identification\"
  and landed here. Hope I'm not stepping on any toes, but I am quite curious what
  font this is.\r\n\r\ncouple of lines (scanned) :\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font-s_3429.png]\r\n\r\nfull
