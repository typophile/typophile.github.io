  I, as a general rule. So I'd value your feedback on these sketches of my latest
  typography-based logo.\r\n\r\nDo you \"get it\"? (Especially the Jazz reference.)
  Which option works best?\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nAmado\r\n\r\n[file attachments: 4]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I only 'got it' with option 3 and 4 where only the g's swap colour. Maybe
    if you make the g's look more like 8's (no gap). They'd still read as g's but
    the concept of the logo would be clearer.

    barely touch, but to the fact that the lower circle isn't closed? Just to clarify.\r\n\r\nHint

  body: Both. IMO they should look like 8's, no two circles as they would be if you
    just closed the gap in the lower circle, but 8's with a spine like in an S.

    this earn a typophile stamp of approval? Even close? That would be remarkable."

  body: "I think you should look at how it works in black and white. Then colour could
    be added and changed according to usage.\r\nI like both versions of g (but the
    gap in the first one could use some refinement). As for treatment, I like the
    alternate versions (they give me the feeling of jazz), not so much the others
    (if you emphasise the g/8 too much, it looks gimmicky)."

  body: "3 and 4 work OK, but more colour contrast would be better.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the execution of the idea is a bit dry and prosa\xEFc \u2013 is there a way you
    can make a more compact logo using the same concept, and/or with more style?"

  body: "Heh. Can I make something with more style? That will remain a lifelong challenge.
    My answer for today is: not without more training and much more practice. Or I
    could give money to someone competent.\r\n\r\nI have taste, but my skills are
    elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe point of the alternating colors (and yes, this works OK
    in b/w) is to mimic the practice of Jazz/Blues improvisers passing solos back
    and forth, 4 (or 8) measures at a time. Making the /g/ into an /8/ -- plus the
    fact that there are two of them and they can be different colors -- just helps
    add to it. (They <em>traded</em> the /8/s.) To my mind. Maybe the whole thing
    is too much of an inside joke.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I like the alternating option too.\r\n\r\nThanks
    <em>so much</em> for the feedback. I appreciate that y'all took the time."
