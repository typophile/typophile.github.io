  a lame question but I have truly reached my wits end. So thanks in advance to those

  text in Flash does not allow for kerning. So I decided to solve this problem by
  generating a new version of the font with the &#40;-2&#41; kerning built in, so
  that it would look good and not need any additional work coming straight outta Flash.
  I am not even an occasional user of FontLab, but have spent the day getting aquainted
  with it
