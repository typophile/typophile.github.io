body: "Hey everyone, \r\n\r\nI decided to rework the visual system of a personal web
  project of mine from scratch, and am having problems deciding on a new logoface
  for it. Right now I'm just using Helvetica, but I'm looking for something with the
  same sturdiness and transparency, but a little more playfulness and character. The
  site focus is images and video, so the interface, and ultimately the visual system
  as a whole, should disappear when it needs to.\r\n\r\nThe site is social, and this
  would pretty much be the logotype.\r\n\r\nI'm kind of liking Brauer Neue, but I
  know that I can do better. I was hoping someone might have some suggestions. Already
  went through a few foundries websites and came up with nothing.\r\n\r\nThanks a
  lot!"

    and not as tired \u2013 how about <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/font/breuertext\">Breuer</a>*
    maybe? (There's also a <a href=\"http://www.typetrust.com/font/breuerheadline\">Headline
    variant</a>.) Or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/device/paralucent/\">Paralucent</a>?
    Warmer / less tech-y: <a href=\"http://www.klim.co.nz/national_samples.php\">National</a>?
    If you want less quirky and more geometric/clean, maybe look at <a href=\"http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik\">Graphik</a>,
    and <a href=\"http://www.klim.co.nz/founders_samples.php\">Founder's Grotesk</a>.
    \r\n\r\nThese are just a few that popped into my mind, there are many more\u2026
    \r\nMaybe also look at the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/helvetica/\">Helvetica
    Alternatives Fontlist</a> over at FontShop.\r\n(* Be sure to read the EULA, IIRC
    Typetrust requires special licenses for logos and such.)"
