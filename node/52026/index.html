<p>Due to all the free merch offers through Veer, I have now acquired two, tag says men&rsquo;s size medium although it&rsquo;s a unisex garment. I will be posting one on ebay (U.S.) later today if anyone is interested. This is the original design, the navy with white type. I will be happy to ship outside of the U.S.</p>
