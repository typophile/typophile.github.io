  airline hlx.com. It's advertising for the 'South of Sardegna'. I wasn't able to
  find a similar logo on the web.\r\n\r\nI doubt it's a custom title, but who knows.
  I could imagine this is a regular font. I do hope that the image helps.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/south_of_sardegna_6401.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nChristian"
