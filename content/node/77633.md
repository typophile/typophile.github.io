body: "* Has anyone had any problems using the Small Caps feature in an Open Type
  font purchase?\r\n\r\n* Has anyone had problems using Open Type in Microsoft Word,
  PowerPoint or Excel?\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project for a client in which I'm rebranding
  their marketing materials. I'm using Gill Sans Small Caps for headings and Gill
  Sans Roman, italic bold etc. I use both a Mac and PC. The client uses a PC.\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to decide if it would be best to get the full font family in open type (31
  fonts). However the Small Caps are not listed in the Glyph section of the website
  and under \"try font\" Small Caps does not come up, but \"display\" does? When I
  called the font company they said that small caps should be listed under the character
  map of the website but its not coming up for some reason. They said Small Caps should
  be able to be used in design programs from the glyph pallet but in Microsoft you
  would have to use a character map to bring it up. That would take a considerable
  amount more design time to manually plug in the small caps headings. I also heard
  that you can use True type on both mac and PC but when I talked to my printer he
  said they've had problems with output from mac before using true type.\r\n\r\nGill
  Sans Full Family Pack (31 fonts)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?productid=666585&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=27403&query=GILL%20SANS&SCOPE=Fonts\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nI
  could get the basic Gill Sans Family Pack OTF (15 fonts) + a Small Caps/OsF Package
  (6 fonts)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?productid=215380&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=25485&query=GILL%20SANS&SCOPE=Fonts\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?productid=215383&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=25488&query=GILL%20SANS&SCOPE=Fonts\r\n\r\nThis
  would be a purchase of less fonts but I know for sure Small Caps would come up.
  \ I'd also have to buy the Small Caps package twice, one for Mac and one for PC.\r\n\r\nOr
  I could buy each individually, and get the ones that come in open type in that format
  and the small caps in mac postcript and later pc truetype/postscript so the client
  can use it \r\n\r\nI appreciate any thoughts! thanks :-)"
