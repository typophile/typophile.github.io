  still rough, didn't do fine tunings of those existing letters (e.g. some parts are
  still not consistent, proportions in some letters are not good, should letters /n/,
  /u/, /u/, /p/, /q/ have same upper part of left stem as on /p/ or /n/ ...). Pretty
  a lot of things to define and to think about.\r\n\r\nBut, I think this looks like
  a promising beginning and could be interesting to complete it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adhez_preview1_3952.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/adhez_preview2_4174.jpg]"

  body: so far looks great to me. I think the horizontal bar in the e should by higher
    and the top bowl should be 'squared'.

    do fine tunings yet, so this is just an roughly version.\r\n\r\nDo you see something

  body: "I like the look of this so far (and the idea of an online diary of the font
    is a good one!) The letters seem to go well together on the whole and the words
    you've displayed look good already. \r\n\r\nI like the /a/ a lot, it has a very
    cool shape. The /e/ is also much better now. I have no problem with the /Q/ on
    first glance, although I'm not a fan of the /K/ and /k/. On the uppercase one,
    the horizontal crossbar seems a little too high and on the lowercase, it seems
    very thin compared to the quite thick top stroke and leg. The /A/ also seems quite
    heavy to me compared to the /O/, /Q/ and a lot of the other uppercase (maybe make
    the crossbar thinner?).\r\n\r\nOverall nice job so far and look forward to seeing
    this develop!\r\n\r\n- Claire"

  body: "There are a couple words that stand out in the PDF. In the \"so\" combination
    in \"association\", the /s/ seems to dip farther below the baseline than the /o/.
    It might help if you fatten the /o/ to match the square shape of the other rounded
    letters. The /s/ looks a little bottom heavy too. Also, the \"db\" in \"standby\"
    seems out of balance. I am torn on this one because the b/d and p/q asymmetry
    add a lot of character to the typeface.\r\n\r\nI notice in this 1.5 version you
    changed your strokes to have a uniform weight. The result is a quite nice, utilitarian
    look, but you lose some of the warmth of the original. It would be nice to see
    both variations developed, possibly in a true-italic instead of an oblique style."

  body: "You're right.\r\n\r\nStill it isn't perfectly tuned. It's a little bit tricky
    to concentrate and notice everything at once, that's why I go step by step. I
    notices also like you some irregularities with rounded shapes.\r\n\r\nAbout /b/
    and /d/... to be honest, you're not the only one who said that, but I guess I
    gotta decide by myself what should be done... to change them completely or just
    some details.\r\n\r\nMaybe I make an Display family, with more flown in the shapes.
    That thing (lost of basic sensual lines) always somehow disappear at the end and
    as you work on typeface, it live and change by every day. But, you're 100 % right.\r\n\r\nYeah,
    I was thinking only about true italic, not oblique, cause I think it already have
    some interesting shapes done in this 1.5 version that can be used for italic.\r\n\r\nThank
    you very much for having a time to see and comment this type. It was very useful."

  body: "I like this face--very much. \r\n\r\nThere is one niggling thing that bothers
    me-- when the /a/ is preceded by the /d/, the /a/ seems diminished. I can't put
    my finger on it. It doesn't show in /ga/ for instance -- but it does /da/. (I
    haven't tried /pa/ or /ba/.) I'm not sure if what I see is caused by the counter
    size in the /a/ or by the apparent x-height of the /a/ in the /da/ pairing.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a very small thing, but I thought I'd pass it on.\r\n\r\nClair"

    thinking the problem is not with the /a/ but with the counter size in /d/. And
    it seems to be at the top  -- high curve edge at the left top of the bowl and
    not enough dip into the stem?? \r\n\r\nJust musing here. \r\n\r\nClair"

  body: The word 'REAL' looks out of balance because the bowl of the R is too big.
    I think you should make it more like Frutiger's R, which has a smaller bowl. That
    underwater thing looks really funny though I'd love to see some swimming glyphs
    in it.
