  illustrator with all accent sets and a couple of alternates for certain letters.
  I want to bring everything to Fontlab and make it a usable font.\r\n\r\nWhich glyphset
  table should I use? \r\nOpentype Standard\r\nMacOs Roman \r\netc \r\netc\r\n\r\nWhat
  is the difference, how do you define chosing one over another?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "It doesn't matter. FontLab re-sorts the glyphs according to what display
    option you choose, but internally everything will just have the same assignments.\r\nOf
    course you need to save your glyphs under the correct Unicode values -- after
    all, that's how FontLab recognizes them and can display them in any order you
    liike.\r\n\r\nWhat encoding you choose is only relevant if you intend to export
    your font for a system that limits the type of characters, i.e., if you want to
    limit yourself to Mac Roman Encoding, you cannot include Chinese as these characters
    will never get included."
