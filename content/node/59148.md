body: "[[http://www13.plala.or.jp/french/rbo.htm|Here is the link.]]  I'm hoping someone
  has a computer that can see the font instead of nonsense letters and symbols. Anything
  on the page that is not in English isn't translating into the proper symbols, and
  I can't get a file to support that font without knowing what the font is I need.\r\n\r\nI
  mostly stumbled upon it and am not in dire need to know or anything, but I prefer
  to minimize sites that feed me goobledeegook.  The Japanese Amazon store site, the
  Japanese MMO Ragnarok Online, the Japanese Google, and many other Japanese pages
  found via Google display Japanese characters perfectly fine on my computer; so,
  it isn't because I completely lack support for Japanese fonts.  On this page though,
  only words in English and pictures show a human language instead of \"\xC5\u201A\xCC\u201C\xAE\x8D\xEC\u201A\xC9\u0160\xD6\u201A\xB5\u201A\xC4\x81i\u201AO\u201AW\u201AP\u201AO\u201AQ\u201AV\x81j\"
  and similar nonsense strings.\r\n\r\nWell, I figure this request is a bit unusual,
  but I appreciate any help I might receive.  Good hunting!"

    tell your browser to render the site as \"Shift JIS\". Depends on your browser,
    but usually you do that in the View menu under Text Encoding or someplace similar."
