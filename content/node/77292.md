  prior to the big jobhunt, and am having some difficulty picking a typeface to suitably
  match the energy and vibe of the architecture. \r\n\r\nThe images below show the
  architecture - it's very contemporary, fairly complex, bold and still somewhat delicately
  crafted. Would you encyclopaedic typophiles have any typefaces you could recommend
  to match or contrast with these buildings? \r\n\r\nI need one Headline face and
  one Body Text face - I'm currently using Eureka and Myriad, but I think I could
  use some help. The layouts will be fairly minimal, with enough white space to let
  the work stand out. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your input!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cover_3983.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/03_5978.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/14_4395.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/04_4212.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/07_5632.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/11_6132.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/06_5082.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/07_5144.jpg]"

    Mach]] comes to my mind, but it might be too decontructivist.\r\n\r\nAlright sounds
    good to me too. I am thinking light weight. In my experience bold fonts tend to
    look blotchy on architectural drawings."

    the subtlety of its drawing and sharp and tasty curves will complement your work,
    while at text size the open, office-y tone of the lower case is suitably spacious.
    \r\n\r\nIt also has a dual personality, like your main building.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks to all of you for your input!\r\n\r\n@Penn: Alright Sans looks great.
    I might buy a couple weights.\r\n@Kupfers: I agree that FF Mach might be a little
    too much.\r\n@Nick: TheMix was part of my initial shortlist, but I eliminated
    it for some reason. I'll give it another shot."
