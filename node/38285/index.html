  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have been expanding my Monospace to support Latin-Vietnamese and the the Unicode around those points and I have come across the H cedilla & so on. When this happened I went back to my C cedilla design and I saw a problem - with a different context my Cedilla style doesn't seem to read well enough. I had opted for the simpler cedilla thinking that it would translate more readily into pixels at 10-14pt - which worked well. Now, with better insight into rendering behavior, trends, and a slightly less screen oriented intent I am thinking that a Calibri style might be better. But I thought it might be interesting to hear what you all think/feel about this. I am open to re-hearing why the full sickle model is best, especially if it comes with some screen oriented advice.

Here are some samples to look at. First what I started to think twice about:

and then a sampling of Cedillas with Calibri pointed out.

		<div class="commentbody">Same here, but it's also the only option for print as the traditional form is way too small and delicate to really register in very small size. Also the pure stubs as is shown to the left of Calibri can be confused with comma accents, so that's not the way to go, and my decenders are very very short so there is no room draw complicated forms.</div>

I was looking at this just now as well.

<cite>Under comma and cedilla
The under comma is the preferred form in the Romanian language for the uppercase characters S and T with under comma accent and lowercase s and t with under comma accent. Four new Unicode values have been defined to accommodate this preference.</cite>

<cite> Scommaaccent U+0218 ; scommaaccent U+0219 ; Tcommaaccent U+021A ; tcommaaccent U+021B
The connecting cedilla is the preferred form in the Turkish language for the uppercase S with cedilla and lowercase s with cedilla:</cite>

<cite>Scedilla U+015E ; scedilla U+015F
An under comma is an acceptable alternative to a connecting cedilla for the following characters:</cite>

<cite>Ccedilla U+00c7 ; ccedilla U+00e7 ; Kcedilla U+0136 ; kcedilla U+0137</cite>

<cite>Lcedilla U+013b ; lcedilla U+013c ; Ncedilla U+0145 ; ncedilla U+0146</cite>

<cite>Rcedilla U+0156 ; rcedilla U+0157 ; Tcedilla U+0162 ; tcedilla U+0163
Note : In the Portuguese and Catalan languages the traditional connecting style of a cedilla is more commonly preferred for the Ccedilla U+00c7 and ccedilla U+00e7.</cite>

<cite>It is common in modern designs and French typography to see a cedilla design with a stroke that is not connecting or as in common handwriting, a line that passes through the bottom or beneath the uppercase or lowercase c.</cite>

<cite>A good solution for these differences would be a language dependant substitute glyph for the Ccedilla U+00c7 and ccedilla U+00e7.</cite>

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/frenspan_6006.gif]

<cite>Additional note : Recently some type designers have been designing a hybrid form of an under comma or cedilla. This takes the shape of the lower portion of the connecting cedilla and is used beneath any base character which has an open base as on the uppercase R, K, k, N and n. </cite>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">From Wikipedia:

<cite>Many languages add a diacritical comma (virgula) to various letters, such as ș, ģ, and ķ. These marks resemble cedillas, and some sources consider them to be cedillas, but they are officially considered commas. This is particularly confusing for characters which can adopt both diacritics: for example, the consonant /ʃ/ is written as ş in Turkish but ș in Romanian, and Romanian writers will sometimes use the former instead of the latter because of insufficient font or character-set support.</cite>

Some OpenType language specific alternatives should fix that...</div>
