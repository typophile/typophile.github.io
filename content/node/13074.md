  body: "Oh Tiffany, there are some really wonderful, wonderful places. Here are my
    favorites:\r\n\r\nArgosy has a little of everything and is always worth a visit.
    116 E 59th (at Lexington, I think, or else Park).\r\n\r\nJ. N. Bartfield at 30
    W 57th is excellent.\r\n\r\nBauman Rare Books at 535 Madison is good.\r\n\r\nThe
    Manhattan Rare Book Co. at 1050 2nd in the big antique market there sometimes
    has nice things and specimen books, mostly modern firsts though\r\n\r\nBarbara
    Leibowitz Graphics has lots of illustrated books, posters and other ephemera and
    v. good prices. She only shows via appointment though but I am sure you can find
    her online. A lot of the better dealers in NYC will only show via appointment
    but the good ones will be very happy to talk to you and show you what they have.\r\n\r\nGotham
    Book Mart is still fun. 16 E 46th.\r\n\r\nLeonard Fox has a lot of modern rare
    stuff, incl. some art and ceramic work in his gallery, and specializes in art
    nouveau / deco and fashion. He's at 790 Madison.\r\n\r\nBlack Sun Books at 157
    E 57th is terrific.\r\n\r\nJames Cummins at 699 Madison is very good.\r\n\r\nSvetlana
    Aronov was very good. She died recently and I am not sure if someone else has
    taken over her business, but she had a really excellent and varied stock with
    probably the best stock of Russian avant-garde stuff anywhere.\r\n\r\nUrsus Books
    is very popular, at 981 Madison (upstairs). They have a big stock, nice bright
    room, obsequious staff who know their stuff.\r\n\r\nMartayan Lan is in the Heron
    Tower at 70 E 55th, several floors up. Lots of maps, and an excellent collection
    of rare books, mostly history of science and things like that, some incunabula.\r\n\r\nI
    have never been to visit Richard Ramer but he has a HUGE holding of rare books
    on a tremendously wide variety of subjects. I will visit him on this trip I think.
    225 E 70th. He specializes in books on Portugal, Spain, Latin America, Brazil,
    Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\n"

  body: When I was last there in 1999, <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/home/OAKLANDERBOOKS/">Oaklander
    Books</a> was the best source of secondhand and antiquarian type books I visited.
    It is over by Chelsea, in an upstairs room in a warehouse/studio building. It
    is best to call ahead to ensure they are open; I don't think they keep very regular
    hours, and most of their business is by catalogue and Internet.

  body: "Thanks to both of you. -- I'm actually, sort of, in conversation with Oaklander
    and do hope they are the final group, but if that doesn't work I am looking for
    an alternative. \r\n\r\nJLT -- Amazing list of booksellers. This thread should
    be added to a thread about what to do when in the big apple."
