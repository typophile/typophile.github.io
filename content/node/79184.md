  body: "That's not a lot to go on. Do they use this lettering on anything else?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    please, can you edit this title to include 'sans', because usually 'modern' is
    a term for a high contrast serif typeface. This title is too close to the generic
    'identify this font' title that usually accounts for almost half the threads.
    There's almost no good way to find the thread again if we can't find the answer
    in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nFor this thread \"'nine hours gh' soft sans\" would be
    much easier to find again. Thanks.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    is custom, myself. The h is different from the rest of the type, which frankly
    is too small to see properly."
