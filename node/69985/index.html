		<div class="commentbody"><p>I really never have liked Apple. They sell stuff well because on the outside it&rsquo;s designed nicely. On the downside: there is hardly any customization ever, in terms of performance, their products are usually not on the high end, their products become obsolete extremely quickly, and to top it off, they charge more for their basic stuff compared to high-end companies. All their shit is proprietary. New phone? New charger. Want to project with your laptop? Gotta buy an Apple-branded adapter. Why not use industry-standard mini-USB? Or HDMI/DVI?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re making this whole deal like &ldquo;Flash crashes Macs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Flash is outdated.&rdquo; The only reason Apple isn&rsquo;t supporting Flash is because, by doing so, they will sell wayyyy less Apps in the AppStore, thus losing tons more money. I, personally, hardly ever see Flash crash so I don&rsquo;t know where they got that. And the whole deal with &ldquo;Adobe being close-sourced&rdquo; and &ldquo;hard to deal with&rdquo;? HAH! Every company that has ever worked with Apple says they&rsquo;re a nightmare. Close-sourced? Look at yourselves. You sued a company that was putting MacOS on non-Apple-branded hardware for no reason, other than you may have been losing (very little) money. Great job.</p>
<p>Jon Stewart does a nice commentary:

<p>BUT, on the positive: their computers look beautiful. :)</p>

<p>Apple seems to be taking a brunt of the blame in this &lsquo;debate&rsquo;. I think it&rsquo;s rather telling that it wasn&rsquo;t until this past release of CS5 that Adobe made native Cocoa apps.</p>
<p>Apple is a forward thinking company and I&rsquo;d agree with Steve that if you rely on the 3rd party IDEs, your developers will always be several steps behind what Apple is doing. At that point, you&rsquo;d not differentiating your platform very well (which has always been Apple&rsquo;s primary business model).</p>
<p>Does that piss of a chunk of developers out there who like the idea of right once deploy in multiple devices? Absolutely. But there are so many dedicated Apple developers that I think they&rsquo;re not too worried about that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, personally, hardly ever see Flash crash so I don&rsquo;t know where they got that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They get it from more than one person&rsquo;s first-hand personal experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;other than you may have been losing (very little) money&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, they want to fully manage and preserve the user experience. I think there&rsquo;s room for arguments of anti-competitiveness, for sure, but from a basic user experience POV, Apple isn&rsquo;t stupid.</p>

<p>Dedicated software developers to one operating system or one mode of thinking/processing defeats the purpose of market diversity. The reason Microsoft and Adobe are so successful is because they make room for variability and work with programs/developers. Apple says here are the rules, and it can only be done the way we want. In the end, this sucks for developers/users because you&rsquo;re forced into the hole that the company puts you in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They get it from more than one person&rsquo;s first-hand personal experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speaking from more than just one person&rsquo;s experiences. I&rsquo;ve seen MacOS crash tons of times but never because of flash. This has been discussed widely where I am.</p>
<p>&ldquo;preserve the user experience&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that those who bought their computers not from Apple but with MacOS on it did it for that very reason: they didn&rsquo;t want to have Apple controlling every aspect of how they interact/use the product for which they are paying. The Macbooks are completely overpriced and aren&rsquo;t even close to being up-to-date. They&rsquo;re pretty and function well (besides tons of failing hard drives) but they don&rsquo;t even offer quad-core, which for the same price of their basic Macbook you can get a workhorse with Win7 installed (which is just as wonderful an OS as SnowLeopard, if not better for workflow.)</p>
