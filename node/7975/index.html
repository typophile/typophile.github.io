<div class=commentbody>Jeff isn't being pessimistic. When companies stop putting value into design, it hurts everyone who does. <br>A good logo requires lots of research, time, care, and craft. <br>The company may even perceive that they are getting a bargain. They recieve a variety of designs, and they get to pick which one. But a good designer can do in one try what it takes 100 amateurs to attempt (but fail). Likely, instead of a logo that holds its value over time, the company has to redesign once again. Whatever they invested into applications of the first logo is usually lost. Consumers need time to familiarize themselves with a logo, and this time is also lost. <br>David, there is plenty of conversation about speculative contests online. If you read up on it more, and not just Jeff's article, you will see that it isn't positive for anyone, not even for the person who "wins".</div>

<div class=commentbody>David - <br> <br>The only thing worse than a potential client who does not value the efforts of a professional graphic designer is a designer who doesn't appreciate the value of their own time and work. While I enjoy designing logos, and get a great deal of personal satisfaction from my work, I'm running a business and need to make a living. <br> <br>If I want to do some good for a nonprofit organization in whose cause I strongly believe I will produce some pro bono work and then promote the hell out of it. In many cases such organizations can't afford the services of a professional designer and will greatly appreciate what is done for them. There is tremendous value in working with nonprofits in this manner. <br> <br>The problem with the so-called "contests" for for-profit ventures is that the "client" will not appreciate the value of one's work when they are basically getting it for free. That is often what it is worth to them - nothing. These for-profit business are simply trying to avoid paying market value for the work of designers - and getting a lot of speculative designs in the process. They are basically taking advantage of naive designers. <br> <br>The value of my work is determined by 27 years of past experience, my talents and my skills. Potential clients need to base their decision to hire me on my portfolio of past work. They don't get to "test drive" me, by having me produce designs without a contract or deposit check, to see if what I do may fit their needs. <br> <br>Here's a great piece about speculative presentations. It ties into the the whole "client trying to get something for nothing" issue: <br> <br><a href=http://www.creativelatitude.com/articles/articles_cb_spec.html target=_blank>http://www.creativelatitude.com/articles/articles_cb_spec.html</a> <br> <br>- Jeff <br> <br>:: :: :: :: :: :: :: <br> <br>Jeff Fisher :: Engineer of Creative Identity <br>Jeff Fisher LogoMotives <br><a href=http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com target=_blank>http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com</a> <br> <br>:: :: :: :: :: :: :: <br> <br>Member - HOW Magazine Editorial Advisory Board :: 2005 HOW Design Conference Advisory Board <br> <br>Author - "The Savvy Designer's Guide to Success: Ideas and tactics for a killer career" - from HOW Design Books. <br> <br>Speaker: "Tooting Your Own Horn" :: 2005 HOW Design Conference <br> <br>:: :: :: :: :: :: ::</div>

<div class=commentbody>"A good logo requires lots of research, time, care, and craft." <br> <br>It is not clear to me when that time you mean, happens. <br>But I do agree. And a good logo is also a peice of art. <br>And eventually it is part of a system (architecture) too. <br>Or do you charge your clients by hours for a logo ? <br>In this case, a logo job should be poor paid, <br>or I also would I could stand on a busy corner, <br>hat in hand, and beg people to throw me <br>all their wasted hours. <br> <br>Personally, I have done quite many speculative logo <br>competitions.

<div class=commentbody>kris...many of the logo competitions are a business model. CA/Print/Rockport, etc., make money buy printing books full of logos. If they can make money on both ends (submission and distribution), that's only good for business. ;o) <br> <br>If it benefits you, so much the better. <br> <br>In the past, working for a larger design firm, we had a staff person that was in charge of entering every competition. Then, when they'd get published (and they will if you shotgun like that), they'd order a handful of copies. <br> <br>They'd then send these publications directly to the client with a note of thanks. It was a client-retention strategy. "See, we do such a good job, your logo won awards". Not a bad strategy.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Kris. <br>That's fine, it was only a suggestion. <br> <br>Jeff & Alessandro.. <br>I agree in "almost" total absolution. A logo is a very complex thing which takes a lot of thought to get right. <br> <br>To Quote Tony Spaeth <a href=http://www.identityworks.com target=_blank>http://www.identityworks.com</a> <br>"Identity is fact... the effective sum of the facts that can be used, in the minds of various audiences, to distinguish a given entity from all others. To manage identity is to manage these facts." <br> <br>And to quote myself... "A logo done in a day, will soon fade away" <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>Having said all of the above, I still fail to see a problem with providing people with a platform to design a purposeful logo. Competitions "can" provide an opportunity for budding design enthusiasts that they may otherwise not obtain. Yes, there are obviously going to be contradictions to this statement but I stand fast on the point as a general rule. <br> <br>Regards <br>Dave <br> <br>Nodus Logo Competition: <a href=http://www.nodusdesign.com/competition/index.html target=_blank>http://www.nodusdesign.com/competition/index.html</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>Dave, <br> <br>I think Darrell, Jeff Fisher, Lauri Johnson, Brian and Allessandro Segalini are right on, you are just not listening. <br>You will probably answer this posting with another plug for your design firms logo contest just like all your other postings. <br> <br> <br><b>Design contests or spec work are a harmful practice</b> <br> <br>Design contests amounts to providing design work for free. <br>Many major private and public sector clients think it is good business practice to hold a design contest or require spec work as part of their search and selection process when recruiting the services of a graphic designer or design firm. In fact, requests for design contests or spec work: <br> <br>- are exploitative, as they demand design work for free and without guarantee of compensation, <br> <br>- offer no future potential, <br> <br>- can lead to copyright infringement, <br> <br>- devalue the profession of graphic design and lead to negative competitive practices, <br> <br>- threaten the integrity and work ethic of the graphic design profession, <br> <br>- are discouraged by allied professions such as the advertising industry. <br> <br> <br>The 2010 Winter Olympics was awarded to Vancouver Canada. <br>The committee chose a design competition for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Emblem. <br>The prize was $25,000 Cdn.and two tickets to the opening ceremonies. <br>The Society of Graphic Designers of Canada a professional body chose not to recommend participation to its members since it was exploitive. <br> <br><a href="http://www.gdc.net/community/news.php?id=18&press=1&draw_column=3:1:2" target=_top>GDC Response</a> <br> <br>Kosmo</div>

One big <br>goal of my professional organization is the <br>educate everybody else about what a designer is, <br>and the benefit of working with someone with a <br>full set of skills, not just Dreamweaver. <br> <br> <br>This came after this text : <br> <br>. <br> <br>I never give them hell for having a competition, <br>because it is done from ignorance. So I can help <br>educate them. They can take it or leave it. Some <br>people will never get it. <br> <br> <br>Regarding: Announcement of Graphic Design Competition <br> <br>Thank you for your fax regarding the competition. <br> <br>I must decline to participate. As a Professional <br>Member of the Graphic Designers of Canada, I <br>subscribe to our Society's Code of Ethics, which <br>prohibits members from undertaking speculative <br>(I design something; if you like mine, I get paid; <br>if you like someone else's better, I don't get <br>paid) design. <br> <br>I have found that people and organizations <br>seeking quality design are sometimes not well- <br>served by design competitions. A professional <br>designer's job includes research and the <br>establishment (with the client) of an effective <br>marketing plan which should be the driving force <br>behind any design. The risk with requests for <br>speculative design can be that designs submitted <br>might not be founded on sound marketing and long- <br>term planning principles, and therefore not be a <br>strong tool in the development of the <br>organization. <br> <br>I'm not trying to be contentious, but... If you <br>needed legal work done, would you ask a group of <br>lawyers to submit work and the winner would get <br>paid? Or dental work? Or film-making or copy- <br>writing? If not, why is it appropriate for <br>graphic design work? My guess is that it's <br>because you have seen contests like this <br>advertised before. But there are alternatives <br>that are respectful of both a client's finances <br>and a designer's work. <br> <br>I understand an organization's wish to achieve <br>goals in the most economical way. All of my <br>clients want their work done economically. If <br>you are ever in need of design again, there are <br>several ways that designers can be approached, <br>solid working relationships established, and <br>design goals reached, without the 'speculative <br>work request' trap. I'd be happy to discuss this <br>with a representative of your organization, <br>should you want to know more. (This is not a <br>self-serving offer: I am on the executive of the <br>local chapter of the Graphic Designers of Canada, <br>and part of what I do is supply the public with <br>information. When I do this, I remove myself <br>from consideration for professional benefit.) <br> <br>I wish you well in your search for your new <br>identity. <br>Sincerely, <br> <br> <br> <br>AS</div>

<div class=commentbody>"That's a very harsh and unfair comment Darrel. " <br> <br>No it's not. It'a a pathetic bit of spam. <br> <br>If you want a free logo...just ask for it. Don't patronize people with the laughable 'win free advertising on our site!' crap. You need to shed a few pounds off your company's ego there if you honestly believe that is of any value to anyone. <br> <br>It also appears you only signed up for these forums so you could post your silly ad in every single post. <br> <br>Finally, having a contest shows no respect for your own company and certainly no respect for the graphic designers you want to work for you. I *do* think there is a time and a place for these sort of things, and they're not always a bad thing. This one clearly is, though. <br> <br>But hey, good luck with it all...and feel free to stick around in here, but stop it with the Spam.</div>
