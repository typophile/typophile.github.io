body: Could anyone point me in the direction of any freeware fonts that have the same
  look as the attached files.  I'm looking for that retro soccer jersey/news station/toronto
  blue jays lettering that's typically very rounded and uses two lines to make the
  shape of the letter.  I've looked all over on many freeware font sites to no avail,
  but if someone knows the name, it would make searching a lot easier.  Thanks.
