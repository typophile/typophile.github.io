  font that was used in the original\r\n\r\nThis is the font I'm looking to identify:
  http://i.imgur.com/Lssakcl.png\r\n\r\nTo me it looks very Futura-ish aside from
  a few rounded letters, maybe it's modified?\r\n\r\nHere's the entire image, in case
  it helps you: http://i.imgur.com/j7X7PCg.jpg\r\n\r\nI'm convinced \"WEAR\" is a
  custom design and not a font, although if you have any information otherwise please
  let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you, any insight will be useful to me!"

    this lettering, start with any 1960/1980 style and borrow /W and /E from the corresponding
    1970. That should do the job quite nicely.
