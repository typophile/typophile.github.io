  answer. It's German related. Let me know, if the rule is only applied to the German
  language.\r\n\r\nShould I get rid of the second dot at the end of a sentence if
  there is a dot before? \r\n\r\nExample:  \r\nAuf dem Kalender steht Freitag, der
  23.. Eigentlich waren wir aber f\xFCr\u2026\r\n\r\nThis looks really stupid to me.
  So is it allowed to get rid of the second dot?\r\nWhat should i do?\r\n\r\n"

    Grinbgerg]], who used two dots as an intermediate punctuation mark between ellipsis
    and full stop dot.
