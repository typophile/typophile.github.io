  want to keep it somewhat structured, lest it fall into a one-trick-pony category.
  Ligatures and alternates could be fun on this. My biggest concern has been getting
  the thicks and thins in the right places. (I've been looking at Franklin Gothic

  body: "I like it! I feel however that the downstrokes on K and R are too alien.
    It works in the lowercase k. Also, the angle of the K\u2019s downstroke is far
    too steep.\r\nI would also consider the stroke endings of the thin horizontals;
    they look too square to me. The same goes for the thin upstrokes of M, N or U.\r\nJust
    my two cents."

  body: "I like it! A perfect combo with 'Madcon's music, swinging from my speakers
    right now. The lowercase really have a great deal of potential.\r\n\r\nThe Uppercase
    need a lot work. Not sure where to start. Compare them to the lowercase carefully
    and perhaps start from scratch. They need more of the swing that the lowercase
    has plenty of.\r\n\r\nOn the lowercase: Remove all straight stroke endings and
    replace them by the soft stroke endings on n for example. This would affect ijvwxz.
    They don't fit in currently.\r\n\r\no is bit too narrow.\r\n\r\ntittles on ij
    should be more brushy, or just round, instead of the computarized vertical squezed
    ones you made.\r\n\r\nj would probably benefit from a little curve on the bottom.
    \r\n\r\nThe continuation of the swash on g and y (past the stem) looks a bit forced.
    I'd simply get rid of it.\r\n\r\nces are leaning backward ever so slightly\r\n\r\nCalligraphy-wise,
    it makes more sense to make the stroke ending of the ascender on d the same as
    in b. same goes for p and q.\r\n\r\nxz don't fit in. Not sure how to fix this.\r\n\r\nGood

    needs work. The part where the 'crossbar' enters the bowl needs to be thinner.
    The very top node needs be moved to the right a little and the node on the very
    right (top) needs to move up. Just like /k/, /e/ needs to have the 'italic' feeling
    more. Perhaps you could even try to use the bowl of /k/ as a mask for the bowl
    of /e/. I'm not sure wether you should go all the way with the /e/ though, but
    at least more towards the italicness of the bowl of k.\r\n\r\nIn the italic of
    my font, the /a/ (similar to your alternate /a/, which has the same bowl as d),
    appeared to be wider than /d/. It's an optical illusion I really don't understand,
    but you should make sure to check it in your font.\r\n\r\nOne more thing ;-) I
    think it makes more sense to make the bottom of /r/ like the left bottom of /n/,

    This makes it look awkward, as the line to which both right nodes lay collinear
    is now too angled (relative to the horizontal). If you angle that (imaginary)
    line, then be consistent and also give an angle to the upper line which corresponds
    to the both upper nodes (and is, in this moment, perfectly vertical). Or, vice
    versa, get rid of the angularity of the "right line".

    said about /6 9/ may also be the case for 0, although you have to make sure it
    differs enough from the /O/ The bottom of /2/ doesn't work. Maybe get rid of the
    counter curve (going more vertical) or exagerate it.\r\n\r\nTry to flip the crossbar
    of /5/ vertically, so that it moves in the same direction as the crossbar of /2/,
    which is upward.\r\n\r\nCheers! jasper"

  body: "In the bold weight /S/ is definitely too dark.\r\n/s/ may also be a bit too
    thick.\r\n/P/'s bowl could end further down. Right now it's conflicting with your
    lowercase, leaving a white gap (particularly noticeable if you look at /Pi/, which
    is relevant, if you're going to name your typeface Piquant), but I understand
    it's also a matter of style. Consider the option of making an alternate for the
    most problematic pairs.\r\n\r\nI like how your bold /T/ compensates the shortness
    of the right end of the horizontal with a weight increase. Overall, congratulations!
    I really like the feel of it :-)"

  body: Yeah, a few of the uppercase letters in the ultrabold could do with having
    their counters opened somewhat, but overall, this has come on in leaps and bounds
    since the first post (when I already thought is was pretty good!). Nice work.

    soon. ;)\r\n\r\n(I agree w/the /P/. The style does run into an issue there. I'll
    look into an alternate pair.)"

  body: Congratulations on the release! The posters look great. One small thing -
    I don't think the flag shows it off to its full potential. Maybe a closer up example
    of some of the sexy curves in action would be better.
