body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've recently taken on the job of redesigning a reputable student
  newspaper (print) here in the UK and am looking for a Impact-like sans-serif face
  to use as a foundation for the construction of the paper (to be used for article
  titles etc.) \r\n\r\nThe audience is university students from first to third year,
  typically 19-25 year olds. The stress in the brief is on accentuating the 'hard
  news' aspect of the paper, but with a contemporary designer's touch (not my words).
  Something with visual impact, but without being too clunky. \r\n\r\nAbsolutely any
  suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Do ask if you need any more information,
  too.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJez."

    Neue ultra light. Not sure if that helps, just my general impression of a \"trend\"
    for what it's worth.\r\n\r\nDesign should not say \"look at me.\" It should say
    \"look at this.\""

  body: Thanks everybody, Amplitude is a wonder but sadly out of the price range for
    the given task (as I expect many suggestions may be) - but thank you all the same!
    Any other suggestions would be greatly received.
