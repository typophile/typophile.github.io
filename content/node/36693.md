  section of this website is called 'Lyon' and I'd love to know the title font of
  the names of the couple. Sorry I couldn't get a direct link!\r\nIt seems more 'irregular'
  than the closest fonts I've found, but I really can't tell!\r\n\r\nThanks."

    I don\u2019t know the font \u2014 <em>if</em> it\u2019s a font at all; could be
    handwritten, too, no? Hard to say with that sample, but at least the two uc M
    look different. Also, take a look at pic #1, it says \u2018Hand-crafted script
    (henry)\u2019"

  body: "By the look of the letterforms and the consistency of the ink gatherings,
    it looks to me like a font. Probably a font with some customization.\r\n\r\nI
    haven't figured out which one, yet, but I would look at Three Island Press (http://www.texashero.com),
    Archive Type and Walden Fonts, all of whom have some lovely vintage scripts. For
    example, at Three Island Press, Lamar Pen is kinda close, though not nearly as
    interesting.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to know is the font set on Mr. Boddington. I love
    it. Anybody?"

    The similarities between many of the letterforms and the way the ink has bled
    onto the page\u2014for example, on the \"a\"s and the \"M\"s\u2014threw me. She's
    terrific."

    MyFonts and Veer.\r\n\r\nNow then, any takers on the IDs for the Boddington site??"

  body: Ffi, did you ever figure out what font works best?  I want to make my own
    invitations, and this is the exact same invitation I want to replicate.  I have
    seen some things that look okay, but nothing that looks as good.
