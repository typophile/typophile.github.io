  Roman</a> thread, I mentioned Johann Michael Fleischmann's Long Primer Roman No.48
  as my favourite example of the narrow proportioned type that Fournier probably had
  in mind when he spoke of types <em>dans le go\xFBt Hollandois.</em> Kent Lew queried
  the identity of this design, looking for it in the lovely facsimile edition of the
  Ensched\xE9 <em>Proef van letteren</em> of 1768.\r\n\r\nI've now had a chance to
  compare the settings in that volume with those in the Harry Carter English edition
  of Charles Ensched\xE9's <em>Typefoundries in The Netherlands,</em> and hope in
  the next couple of days to also post some scans.\r\n\r\nThe same design is differently
  identified in the two books. On page 195 of the Ensched\xE9/Carter book, it is labelled
  \u2018Groote Garmont Romein\u2019 and identified as \u2018Fig.159 Long Primer Roman
  No.48, cut by Fleischmann c. 1731. Resetting of part of the type-specimen of H.
  Uytwerf, 1733.\u2019\r\n\r\nIn the <em>Proef van letteren,</em> this design appears
  as \u2018Garmond Romein No.1\u2019 (with the English name given, again, as \u2018Long
  Primer Roman\u2019) below a setting of a different typeface labelled \u2018Groote
  Garmond Romein\u2019. The <em>Proef van letteren</em> also gives a different date
  for the design, 1736, but if this type did indeed appear in Uytwerf's 1733 specimen,
  this later date must be incorrect.\r\n\r\nI am more inclined to trust the information
  in the Ensched\xE9/Carter book. The \u2018No.48\u2019 is the Ensched\xE9 inventory
  number. The type was acquired by Ensched\xE9 in 1799, along with other early Fleischmann
  types, from Ploos van Amstel."

    in the morning.\r\n\r\nHrant -- If you look at the faces that Fournier labelled
    thus, I think we can conclude that narrowness was the more overriding characteristic.

  body: "John -- That Garmond Romein No. 1 is certainly a fine example of Fleischman's
    art. Are you sure this is the same as your Long Primer Roman No. 48? John A. Lane's
    notes to the 1768 specimen list this Garmond Romein No. 1 as Ensched\xE9 matrix
    inventory no. 56.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure that particular face is the best example
    of what Fournier was thinking of when labeling his \"dans le go\xFBt Hollandois\"
    cuts. I think that what Fournier perceived as the Dutch penchant for narrow economy
    is better exemplified in Fleischman's second and third Descendiaan Romans, for
    instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fleischman_Desc_6383.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nHrant
    -- In support of my contention that Fournier's <em>go\xFBt Hollandois</em> was
    focused on narrowness, I offer these examples from 1995 facsimile of the 1766
    <em>Manuel Typographique</em>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fournier_PhilGoutHoll_4839.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n(The
    French Philosophie is approximately the same size as the Dutch Descendiaan.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fournier_CiceroGoutHoll_5289.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nIn
    this example (Cic\xE9ro is the next size larger), you can see that Fournier uses
    <em>gros \u0153il</em> (large eye) to designate the larger x-height, adding <em>dans
    le go\xFBt Hollandois</em> for the narrower variation. Fournier also offers a
    variety of <em>petit \u0153il</em> and <em>\u0153il moyen</em> cuts in different
    sizes.\r\n\r\nI do think Fournier exaggerates that so-called \"Dutch\" quality.\r\n "

  body: "Kent, yes, it looks like I was wrong: the Romein No.1 in the <em>Proef van
    letteren</em> is the later \u2018Long Primer Roman\u2019, which Carter identifies
    as being cut in 1736 for Wetstein and records as No.56 in the Ensched\xE9 inventory.
    The caps in particular are very similar to No.48, and it was these I was looking
    at when determining that the \u2018Groote Garmont Romein\u2019 in PvL was not
    the same as No.48 but that the Romein No.1 might be.\r\n\r\nI think No.48 is more
    interesting that No.56. It seems larger on the body, and gives the appearance
    of being a bit narrower. Here it is, as shown in the Carter/Ensched\xE9 book in
    a resetting of part of the Uytwerf specimen (scroll right for the -- less interesting
    -- italic):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FleischmannGGR48_4645.jpg]"

  body: "John -- This is definitely a narrower face than the No. 56. But what nice,
    even color. \r\n\r\nThat looks like an uncharacteristically high-waisted R, more
    Parisian to my eye than what I think of as the typical Dutch Baroque R.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the image."
