body: "Dear Typophile Regulars,\r\n\r\nI have been lead to believe that Thomas Phiney,
  the much respected Adobe software programmer who frequently clarifies matters in
  these forums, has designed a geometric sans serif typeface named HYPATIA SANS. We
  seem to have missed each other at many conferences so I have not personally had
  a chance to examine it closely. Can anyone tell me more? Can we see it? Is it true
  that it was co-designed by Rob Slimback? When will it be released? I am deducing
  that it will be bundled with the CREATIVE SUITE THREE product line. I hope for the
  sake of graphic designers that this is the case!\r\n\r\nAnother topic related to
  our friend, Tom. Does anyone know if his Ph.D. paper on MULTIPLE MASTER technology
  is available on the net? I have been using Letterror's SUPERPOLATOR application
  for several months and I am now interested in the history and theory of interpolation
  techniques. From what I have heard, Tom is the undisputed expert of all interpolation
  so I would very much like to read his paper!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRandolph T. Burke"

    with next Creative Suite. And if I remember correctly, there has been talk about
    his paper, too but he said it was uninteresting or something like that. I hope
    I\u2019m not totally wrong here."

  body: I'm not sure Thomas explicitly said that Hypatia will be bundled with CS3,
    only that it will be released in Spring. Arno Pro was confirmed to be a CS3 bonus.

  body: "Sorry I missed this thread. I was kind of crazy-busy for a while there.\r\n\r\nHypatia
    Sans will be a registration incentive for CS3. Robert Slimbach certainly gave
    me constant feedback and tweaking suggestions; you might reasonably say that I'm
    the designer but he's the art director. There are still some things in the final
    typeface that he wasn't at all convinced about, such as the unicase alternates.
    Lots more info will be available some time next week on my blog.\r\n\r\nThe thing
    on MMs was my master's thesis, not a PhD dissertation. The most useful information
    in it was a detailed exploration of the phenomenon of kinking, which I have been
    known to cover at various seminars such as the ATypI TypeTech Forum. If you ever
    catch me at a conference I'd be happy to go over it at length. A copy of the slides
    from one of my presentations can be found here: http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/atypi2006/Advanced%20MM%20theory.pdf
    , but the kinking issue I mostly do in demonstration, as I recall, so the slides
    may not be very helpful.\r\n\r\nMust run now. Time to read bedtime stories to
    my daughter.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
