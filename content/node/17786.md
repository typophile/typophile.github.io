  Script. A form or [[handwriting]], often [[cursive]] in nature. The word script,
  when used in this meaning, readily brings to mind the fancy, flowery [[Spencerian
  Scripts]] which were adapted for typesetting at a fairly early date. However, there
  are other types of scripts ranging from the [[formal|formal script]] to the [[informal
  script|informal]], as well as many other [[handlettering]] styles.\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a

  Script. A specific [[writing systems|writing system]], such as [[Latin]], [[Cyrillic]],
  [[Arabic]], [[Devanagari]], &c. The [[OpenType]] font format uses [[script tag|script
  tags]] to identify which languages can be typeset using a particular font.\r\n\r\n<strong>See

  programing. [[Python]] scripting knowledge is an advantageous skill for today's
  type designer. Several altruistic designers are willing to share their knowledge
  by sharing [[python scripts]] that they have written as well as helping others to
  learn to write their own scripts."
