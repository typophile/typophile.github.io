  graduated from a graphic design school that heavily stressed art history and typography,
  so don't get me wrong ... I love type and type history. But my question is this:
  in our visually hyperstimulated culture, how important is the background of a typeface
  in its use? Would it really matter if I used an Arts & Crafts typeface to promote
  a large factory? In your experience as typographers and designers, how much does
  the message of the client and the history of the type line up?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/More_3781.JPG]"

    a factory that produces semiconductors would lead to some really stupid-looking
    marketing materials. "

  body: "Hmmm... <em>How relevant is type history?</em>\r\n\r\nI'm so tempted to write
    an article on this, but it's Sunday and we're going out to dinner soon. So here
    are a few responses off the top of my head:\r\n\r\n> Designing and/or using type
    is not very different than any other applied art (fine art, music, literature,
    etc.), cultural or professional craft. Observers and critics often group or <em>define</em>
    the movement or style, while the individuals who created them often pursue what
    they feel is their own course of development. Some studied history or the work
    of their predecessors and some did not.\r\n\r\n> If you're genius enough, you
    need little to stimulate progress or a line of development. If you're like me,
    I needed to see and learn as much as possible in order to move confidently forward.
    With that said, <em>history</em> of any sort can contribute to your overall knowledge
    and awareness of apsects that it would take years to accumalte from individual
    practice and exploration.\r\n\r\n> <em>how important is the background of a typeface
    in its use?</em>\r\nIt's not as important as understanding it's relevance and
    potential for contemporary usage. What origially worked as a superlative text
    or titling face during the eighteen-hundreds or mid-nineteen-fifties is less important
    than it's impact in current usage. In other words, you can draw from the past
    if it can influence today's viewers.\r\n\r\n> Understanding certain details about
    the historic development of type can give you a higher awareness or aesthetic
    sense in regards to specific typographic solutions or refinements. Few graphic
    designers under the age of thirty even know that many type styles were originally
    modified in design for specific point sizes or ranges. Today, using a single font
    for small, mid-sized sub-heads and titles produce much less of the highly balanced
    and refined typography seen in quality hot-metal book publications. Knowing this
    history and then training your eyes to <em>see</em> such refinements can only
    lead to improving your skills as a professional.\r\n\r\nWhoops... time to go eat.

    the same with types.\r\nWhen I saw one of Dan Reynold's fonts, I said \"Typical
    american\".\r\nAnd if you know (I am sure you know) which type is coming out of
    which epoche, you can learn a lot of this types. About the idea of its designer
    and about what it told the people who saw the adds and publications produced by
    these types.\r\n\r\nEverytime I identify a letterpress font for someone, I tell
    him the foundry, the year of its first production date and its designer. For me
    its a general part of the information I was asked for.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"
