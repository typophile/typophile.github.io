  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking for any references, information and examples of logotypes that include underlined like-ordinals characters (mostly a and o). I&rsquo;m quite sure I&rsquo;ve seen those on older buildings from the beginning of twentieth century. I am assuming that it has something to do with Art Deco and maybe what had come right next after it. But all I have found was one image of a rich family&rsquo;s tombstone in Prague (attached).</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t come up with a better title.)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting topic – I came across the phenomenon a couple of days ago in Vienna, Austria on a building where it said &ldquo;ERBAUT ANNº 1912&rdquo; (double underline under the ordinal). Meaning: &ldquo;built in [the year] 1912&rdquo;, so your Art Nouveau suggestion would fit. The origins might have something to do with ordinal indicators – Wikipedia has quite an extensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_indicator">article</a> on the a, o and other superscript forms and their function; my guess would be that in decorative lettering this original function was sometimes retained, sometimes wrongly adapted (as in my example, where Latin &ldquo;anno&rdquo; would not need any ordinal), and sometimes the form lost the original function and took over another (variation, visual balance, ornamentality)… I&rsquo;ll try to find more examples.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&rsquo;t know where it originated but the trend seemed to be swinging from 1880-1910. The Led Zeppelin logo and the calligraphy inside the Zeppelin IV album was based on the same interlock lettering fad. I think they used it to conjure up a mystical Aleister Crowley vibe. Also check the Souixsie and The Banshees logo cover for A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. Have a look at archives of piano sheet music cover art from before and after 1900 and you&rsquo;ll see the evolution of the trend. Piano sheet music cover art seemed like it was a competition to see who come come up with the most outlandish tucks and interlocks. I think the beginning of this trend was the Arts &amp; Crafts movement in situations where a using circular O was thematically appropriate but would have made a title too wide. Instead of squeezing the O narrow and spoiling the theme, the designer would shrink it and add some decorative filler underneath: a bar, diamonds, squares, a teardrop. Articles like THE or AND could be vertically stacked. The horizontals of L,T,Z were used for playful interlocks. The bottom stroke the the K might knock off the stem of a following letter. It was combat! I guess there must have been situations were a designer wanted to pop the O but there was no O in the word so they&rsquo;d pop another letter like the D in your example. But I don&rsquo;t think it was common. Charles Rennie Mackintosh was a famous designer who used the raised O quite a bit. As well as double or triple crossbars on A, H. It may not have been his invention but it&rsquo;s wouldn&rsquo;t surprised me if he didn&rsquo;t help popularize it as he was so influential in Art Nouveau and Arts &amp; Crafts.  The trend seemed to die off with Art Deco and didn&rsquo;t return until those Zeppelin Album covers.</div>
