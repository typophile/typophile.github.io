body: "Got a copy? The one I have is, maddeningly, missing page 293, which should
  show the full character set for Colwell Handletter Italic. I'm currently in the
  process of reworking my version of same (McKenna Handletter), and it would be handy
  to have a scan of the original to double-check my interpolations, extrapolations
  and wild guesses.\r\n\r\nIf you have same and you believe in fair trade, I can swap
  scans of any items(s) you'd like from the 1912 or 1934 ATF catalogs, or Barnhart
  Brothers & Spindler Catalog #9 (c 1907) or #25 (c 1925). If you're a capitalist,
  I would also be willing to trade a 600 dpi grayscale scan of same for a copy of
  <em>Indie Fonts 2</em> or two of my commercial fonts ($39.95 and $40 retail values,
  respectively).\r\n\r\nFinally, at the front of the BB&S catalog #25, they previewed
  typeface in development at the time the catalog was released, one of which was called
  <strong>Trenholm Cursive</strong>. That catalog was the last that BB&S produced
  before giving up the ghost (actually relinquishing its semi-autonomous nature and
  dissolving back into ATF), and it doesn't appear in the 1934 ATF catalog. I did
  locate at least one reference to it from a person who claimed to have the typeface
  in metal but, unfortunately, it was a dead link. Anybody seen it? Anybody got some
  paper on it? Anybody want to wheel and deal?"

    you some time this weekend.\r\n\r\nFor Trenholm, I'd suggest you try the Cary
    Library at RIT and see if they have anything. That's the sort of thing they often
    have.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    covered. Thomas, the suggestion about RIT reminds me (once again and painfully)
    that I am only about twenty miles removed, not only from the Smithsonian, but
    also from the Maurice Annenberg collection of type specimen catalogs at the University
    of Maryland, College Park. If I can EVER see my way clear to taking a couple of
    consecutive weekdays off that don''t involve family obligations of one kind or
    another, I definitely need to get over there.'
