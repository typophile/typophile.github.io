		<div class="commentbody">Biologically speaking the cells which make up the basic building <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blocks of the human body are structurally the same. Yet, in the face <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of this, we still develop into recognizable individuals. How it this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so? Because each individual has a distinct DNA code which differs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->from all others. The result of all this blending of individualism is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->active structure called society. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nomad is an interactive typeface based on this socio-biological <!-- raw HTML omitted -->diagram of human society, where basically each character <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(biological entity) consists of independent cells each with their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->own given code. Once typed, these codes work together to form the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nomad characters. As these characters grow into words, sentences <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and eventually paragraphs they in turn from lager reactive structures <!-- raw HTML omitted -->each with their own unique identities. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unlike other typefaces in its similarity to biological creatures, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nomad relies on its complex structure and its ability to react to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->touch to create a more fluid relationship between the user and itself. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Based on the aforementioned principles, I have designed two prototype <!-- raw HTML omitted -->versions of the Nomad typeface. One, which manifests its independent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of external stimuli through motion, and the second which has an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->interactive component that reacts to external stimulus, thus allowing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it to recognize the presence of the user. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Handwriting allows one to establish the existence of its creator as it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->differs from person to person. Nomad act like handwriting in a network <!-- raw HTML omitted -->situation expressing the existence of the other user through the state of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->its interactivity or motion. As a result of this type of mediation we can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->begin to be felt across the network. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(originally Nomad was developed for touch screen) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the advice.

		<div class="commentbody">Gerhard: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree, this isn't a typeface that anyone should use to set a text block. That's why I was careful to use the word &quot;gestalt&quot; when describing its legibility. (Is &quot;readability&quot; perhaps the preferred term here? All of my dictionaries give almost identical definitions for the two words, i.e., &quot;capable of being read.&quot;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In any event, it is fascinating how the cells' overlapping shapes coalesce into recognizable glyphs that can and do, in fact, succeed in communicating information.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for making the distinction between legibility and readability. But by doing so you have effectively validated the relevance of both! The RvL quote is really too simple-minded. Saying &quot;legibility does not exist&quot; is like saying &quot;communism does not exist&quot;. No concept can exist in its pure state, sure. But even though the Soviet Union was not -and could not have been- a &quot;pure&quot; communist state, it was certainly more communist than the USA. In the same way, Quadraat is more legible (and certainly more readable) than FF Extra. Pretending otherwise is often an escape from having to take the non-artistic issues in typography/type_design seriously, and this leads to inferior communication. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note that intentionally downplaying legibility is something else. It's OK, as long as you have good reason to do it. But legibility *does* exist, and how! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hah. Good points. I should say that I haven't  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bought RVL's argument outright. But I do think it's  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->useful as a way to put legibility in context. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can see how, in the case of Nomad (and even in  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the some of the old Ray Gun stuff) how the seeming  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->abandonment of legibility is just another design  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'element' or 'treatment' (for lack of a better  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->word). That diminished legibility requires readers  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to participate more closely or more actively. When  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this is used properly it can be powerful or  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->delightful or engaging. Used improperly you could  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->lose your audience and fail to communicate your  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->message. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In essence I agree with you Hrant. It takes a good  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->understanding of the rules of legibility and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->readability (and the distinctions of the two) in  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->order to intentionally break them and achieve a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->desired result. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->//joe</div>
