  in the image\r\nposted? And by that I mean more or less, with what art movement\r\ndo
  you associate it?\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture5_4150.jpg]"

    into Arts & Crafts movement, the American wing of which was closely intertwined
    with the Prairie School. Prairie School is, as you probably know, most closely
    associated with domestic architecture and furnishings.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.p22.com/products/|P22]]
    foundry has some nice fonts related to both A&C and Wright, BTW."

    first thing that came to my mind. I found a nice font from P22 that had a nice
    glyph in it. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I showed a friend my line of thinking and when I
    said \"Arts & Crafts,\" he said, \"Art Deco?\" So I'm glad at least other people
    see an Arts & Crafts connotation.\r\n\r\nthanks all."
