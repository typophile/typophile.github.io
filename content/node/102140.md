  body: Not only hand-drawn, but poorly at that. Note the steps in some of the straight
    edges? That logo was done in a vector program and the nodes are offset from each
    other. When you have it redone have them do it right.

    Chekc out the light weight:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/copperplate-gothic/thirty-two-bc/\r\n\r\nIf
    you're just looking for a clean version of the logo, it would take less time to
    redraw in Illustrator than it would to find the font and re-set it."
