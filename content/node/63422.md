  fonts appears on microsoft office programs but on adobe illustrator/photoshop, only

  body: "The blockage has nothing to do with the font source -- well, almost nothing.
    It's a default warning for any \"downloaded content\".\r\n\r\nIt seems to me this
    font doesn't really comply to accepted font standards -- the Windows Font Property
    Viewer can't find any of character/unicode info, version, creation date/time,
    font face and family name, copyright, or anything. However, checking with more
    advanced (cough) software reveals at least <em>some</em> of this information,
    as I noticed its default name consists of Chinese characters. Its \"PostScript
    Name\" is shown as \"By JOSSQ-DMF in BeiJing\", which is definitely a 'what-the-h*!?'
    (PostScript names do not allow spaces).\r\n\r\nAll of this may, or may not, be
    the problem."
