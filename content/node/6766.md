  body: I dont think its possible, right now, to change your current user name, by
    yourself.. <i>Maybe you should contact and ask an admin or a moderator to do so
    and change it.?</i>

  body: Gareth. I wanted to change my username too. But all you can do is create a
    new account and let me know. I&#39;ll then delete your old account. Sorry.
