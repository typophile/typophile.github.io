  body: I once did a hinting project for a large furniture company, and I used VTT.
    It was a major pain, but at least it&#39;s free; you just need to give MS a good
    reason they should give it to you. <BR> <BR>Now that I have FontLab4.5, I assume
    I won&#39;t need it again. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'I&#39;ve used both VTT and FontLab for hinting. Leaving aside the fact that
    one is free and the other is not, here are the main differences: <BR> <BR>FontLab
    hinting is relatively easy to learn, the interface and visual tools are fairly
    intuitive, and the manual is pretty good on this topic. FontLab&#39;s tools provide
    access to the most common subset of things that one would want to do with TT hinting,
    so it is my tool of choice for most jobs. <BR> <BR>VTT was written by a text rendering
    engineer and has a very unfriendly user interface and progressively messy visual
    controls &#40;the word &#39;spaghetti&#39; is frequently used to describe the
    links in VTT&#41;. Although there is some documentation available, VTT presumes
    that you know a certain amount about TT hinting before you start &#40;so even
    if you intend to use VTT, it is a good idea to download the FontLab manual PDF
    and read the hinting section&#41;. Despite these drawbacks, however, VTT is much
    more powerful than FontLab since it exposes the entirety of the TT hinting model.
    As an example of the difference between VTT and FontLab, the latter only permits
    deltas of up to one pixel, while VTT can be set to apply deltas of up to eight
    pixels. The number of times in your life when you will want to apply a delta of
    more than one pixel is probably pretty small, but it&#39;s nice to have this ability
    in VTT in case you ever need it. VTT can be used in three different ways: visual
    tools, TypeMan talk &#40;a &#39;high level&#39; hinting language&#41;, or directly
    on the TT code itself &#40;recommended only for real experts&#41;. Again, you
    are unlikely to need this extra power.'

  body: Me not really; John yes. <BR> <BR>But I still think some of those are very
    nice! <BR>BTW, can you elaborate on the &#34;cursive&#34; &#40;?&#41; model third
    from the top? I&#39;ve never seen it before - but it seems to have a certain potential
    in terms of typographic reform, or at least optimization. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
