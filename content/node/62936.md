  play around with and amongst other things create my own work from but according
  to all I've read  - I just can't do it - do I now have to design my own font before
  I can start work?, it seems daft. A bit like building a petrol motor car before
  I can design an electric car of the future.\r\n\r\nAny simple answers?"

    Tweaking the modular Fontstruct fonts with optical corrections in a \"proper\"
    font editor might be a really good exercise for a start."

  body: "<em>The word lazy comes to mind.</em>\r\n\r\nthat is a bit harsh, perhaps,
    but pretty accurate. you shouldn't be afraid of doing the amount of work necessary.
    shortcuts only get you mediocrity. Here are my thoughts, hopefully they will help.\r\n\r\nif
    it is just the experience of drawing letters yourself that you are after, you
    don't need anything but illustrator, inkscape, or any other vector drawing software.
    sophomore year of college I drew an entire alphabet plus 12 or so letters for
    3 other fonts in about 3 months as part of a project. this was really quite easy,
    but there was no functional font at the end. for functionality, those letters
    would have had to be imported into FontLab or another font development software.\r\n\r\nif
    a functional font, designed by you, is what you want, then you will need to start
    from scratch. or, perhaps, what Jens mentions above might work. just <em>please</em>
    obey other peoples' intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\nif you are simply looking
    for a free font, then google 'free fonts' there are tons out there that, while
    generally mediocre, can work for a variety of situations. just remember to respect
    the designer's intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\ncheers."

  body: "Thanks for the input. In response to the 'lazy' insult - it is in fact just
    the opposite reason - I have designed over four new fonts in as many months based
    (and I use the word loosely) on the Arial family. These are highly stressed and
    deliberately damaged by over scanning, often with strange and wonderful results!\r\nThe
    reason for asking is these new designs make the font completely - and I mean completely
    unrecognisable from their former life.\r\n..And as for learning from scratch,
    I learnt my trade using Letraset.\r\nI was just trying to do the decent thing!\r\n\r\nCampaigner"
