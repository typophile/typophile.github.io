    James Bible, though I&#39;ve never seen a sample, so I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s
    hard for me to tell from the small size, but the Roman font and the wording both
    seem a little late to be from the early 1500s &#40;first English bibles start
    around 1526&#41;. I&#39;m thinking somewhere between 1570 and 1800. <BR> <BR>But
