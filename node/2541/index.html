Apparently they must tolerate everything, even people who are sworn to kill them. And if Israel does <i>what any other country would do</i> in response to 50 years of continuous attack by multiple self-proclaimed enemies, then they are called 'Nazis'. <BR> <BR>When the Nazis began their persecution of the Jews in Germany and then in other European countries, had the Jews sworn to push the Germans into the sea? Had the Jews declared that Germany had no right to exist? Had the Jews repeatedly launched multiple armies against Germany? Had the Jews conducted decades of terrorist campaign against German civilians? <BR> <BR>Maybe while you're visiting the Weisenthal website looking for reasons to gag, you should read some of it. Start <a href="http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/resources/courage/p01.html">here</a>, look at every panel, read every quote, and then stop spouting rubbish. <BR> <BR> <BR>I agree entirely that the swastika symbol per se shouldn't be always and everywhere villified, and that we need to understand and acknowledge the different contexts in which it has been used and continues to be used. See my comments at <a href="http://typographi.ca/000755.php">Typographica</a>. But 'gagging' at the thought of 'international Jewish human rights group' is just plain old antisemitism: sad, sick and stupid.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, I generally don't accuse <i>people</i> of antisemitism*, because often the people who make antisemitic statements have no clue that what they are saying belongs to an established anti-Jewish discourse. Your statements seemed to me be antisemitic. Criticising the policies and actions of the Israeli government is not antisemitism; calling them 'Nazis disguised as Jews' is. Gagging at the combination of 'human rights organisation' with 'Jewish' looks like an antisemitic reaction whether it is consciously intended as such or not. I'm not singling your statements out, Gerald; over on Typographica we had Hrant evoking the stock antisemitic international Jewish conspiracy theory with his 'dark undercurrents of international lobbying', and his bizarrely veiled references to a 'party' and 'people' with an agenda (whose 'tool' I apparently am because I disagree with Hrant); again, I don't think Hrant is necessarily intending to be antisemitic, but he is using terms and evoking ideas that belong to that discourse. <BR> <BR> <BR>* In the sense in which the term is clearly and unambiguously understood by pretty much <i>everyone</i>. The insistence on the dictionary definition of Semite to negate the use of the term antisemitic is itself a well documented strategy of antisemites, who seek to deny the unique historical phenomenon of antisemitism in European culture. Other forms of European racism &ndash; anti-Black racism for example &ndash; are no less ugly and indefensible, but they are of a different character (in large part because they have not developed over almost 2000 years and are not so ingrained &ndash; so ingrained that even people who do not consider themselves antisemtic hold Jews to standards that do not apply to any other peoples). The term antisemitism has been used to describe this phenomenon for a long time: when 19th century racialists wrote about 'the Semite' they meant a Jew. Individuals may, more accurately, be anti-Jewish, but their statements &ndash; and even the statements of people who do not consider themselves anti-Jewish &ndash; are likely to belong to a long tradition, and that is what we call antisemitism.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, <BR> <BR>You, and  they are just going to have to be a little more specific. <BR>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. <BR><i>Is Judaism a race? If you were to say so, most Jews would think you were an antisemite!</i> <BR>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. <BR><i>A Jew is any person whose mother was a Jew or any person who has gone through the formal process of conversion to Judaism.</i> <BR>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <BR><i>It is important to note that being a Jew has nothing to do with what you believe or what you do. A person born to non-Jewish parents who has not undergone the formal process of conversion but who believes everything that Orthodox Jews believe and observes every law and custom of Judaism is still a non-Jew, even in the eyes of the most liberal movements of Judaism, and a person born to a Jewish mother who is an atheist and never practices the Jewish religion is still a Jew, even in the eyes of the ultra-Orthodox. In this sense, Judaism is more like a nationality than like other religions, and being Jewish is like a citizenship. See What Is Judaism?</i> <BR>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <BR> <BR><i>In the 1980s, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Jews are a race, at least for purposes of certain anti-discrimination laws. Their reasoning: at the time these laws were passed, people routinely spoke of the &quot;Jewish race&quot; or the &quot;Italian race&quot; as well as the &quot;Negro race,&quot; so that is what the legislators intended to protect.  <BR> <BR>But many Jews were deeply offended by that decision, offended by any hint that Jews could be considered a race. The idea of Jews as a race brings to mind nightmarish visions of Nazi Germany, where Jews were declared to be not just a race, but an inferior race that had to be rounded up into ghettos and exterminated like vermin.  <BR> <BR>But setting aside the emotional issues, Jews are clearly not a race.</i> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/judaism.htm#Nation" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/judaism.htm#Nation">http://www.jewfaq.org/judaism.htm#Nation</a></a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This whole thing just seems silly and wrong in many ways. How can Microsoft believe that by removing the swastika from a typeface that they are doing the world any sort of good? It's just denying a part of the past, one that in my opinion should not be forgotten. Probably the next step would be to photoshop out any sign of a swastika from their photos in Encarta. I actually read a newspaper article a long time ago, where a teacher was demanding that the school board remove all photographs of Hitler and especially any photo with a swastika in it as supposedly they promote hate crimes. Now, maybe I just had teachers with a different sense of the cirriculum, but I remember WWII being explained as a dark time for humanity, not a promotion for Nazis. <BR> <BR>In short, as soon as we start to forget or wash over things that have happened in the past that we did not like, they are bound to happen again. If Microsoft is so worried about people's reaction to the swastika, then why not start an education program on what the swastika means and why it should not be forgotten instead of erasing a very important part of world history?</div>

After all the 'evil' swastika is a symbol for a defunct political organization run by a crack-pot dictator, who now, thankfully, is dead. Unfortunately he was a great teacher. He used the same propaganda techniques as those that use the word <i>&quot;anti-semitism&quot;</i> to silence protest. <BR> <BR>To win argument at cost of human dignity or common respect. <BR> <BR>Thank you from saving me. I have been held hostage by mobbish bullies. Sometimes I wonder who wears the sheets. I appreciate that.

I find it unimaginable they could have missed that by accident. I do not believe that there was any nasty intentions for their inclusions however. I see no reason for over reacting. But I imagine some one used the <i>anti-semitism</i> word on them. <BR> <BR>Silly, although the right thing to do, to provide a tool for removal. However the problem I see is that the only people who will use it are the same people that would  not hit the Swastika Key in the first place. <BR> <BR>It is kind of like taking the guns from the good guys and giving them to the bad. But still, Microsoft has done the right thing, no matter how silly it is. <BR> <BR>Anything is better than been accused of <i>anti-semitism</i>. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, you're just not getting it, are you? Read my last message again. I'm not calling you an antisemite: I'm saying that your statements read as antisemitic because whether you realise it or not you are using phrases and ideas that belong to an establish antisemitic discourse. Remember, for 1600 years almost every statement about Jews by non-Jews has been negative and inciteful. In that context, you can't simply open your mouth and trot out statements like 'Nazis disguised as Jews' and not have it sound antisemitic, whatever your actual intent. <BR> <BR>All I'm saying is that you &ndash; and me, and everyone else &ndash; needs to be very careful and very specific in our language. <BR> <BR><i>Anything is better than been accused of anti-semitism.</i> <BR> <BR>Is antisemitism better than being accused of antisemitism? I'm not interested in 'silencing protest' or 'winning arguments at any cost'. I'm interested in you realising what your actual statements convey to people, rather than what you might think or hope they convey.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This thread has gone from a comment about a symbol to an anger management session. I was riding my bike in Central Park today in a Noreaster (Snow) and The road runners club had a running race that was going to start soon, my riding buddy and I came to 90th street on the east side and the runners were blocking the  whole road walking to the start/finish my friend Jose asked a runner to move over to allow us to pass and he went balistic, we just rode away and I remarked how he must of just had a fight with his wife or kids, that his anger had nothing to do with us but with his own issues - we just happened to be there. My point is stop this bickering take a deep breath and lets understand that no matter how much you think you are right, someone else has another opinion. I don't spend my engery being angry on my bike I have to use that energy to peddle it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I certainly can't defend everything Gerald is spewing, but the emotions in him have a reason. And why is there so much of this emotion in the world? People don't hate for the fun of it - they hate when they see injustice. The fact is, the Star of David symbolizes qualitatively the same thing to Palestinians as the Swastika does to Jews. And not just to Palestinans. There is graffiti the world over (including one I saw in Halkidiki, Greece, last year) saying things like &quot;$ + Star_of_David = Swastika&quot;. But the Star of David stays in the font. Don't kid yourselves, children - your world is not some clean, orderly, just and fair place. Amd it's becoming increasingly the opposite under the powers that be. This is what proud Westerners like John will prevent you from seeing, since it dessimates their coping mechanism. <BR> <BR>BTW, John, your standard &quot;you sound anti-semitic&quot; escape clause is spineless, and you know it. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Nazi Germany, Israel.

But the Star of David stays in the font.</i> <BR> <BR>What do you think was meant by the Star of David in that graffito? Israel or Judaism? If the latter, are you saying that the Star of David should be removed from the Bookshelf 7 symbol font because it may offend antisemites? There is a massive rise in antisemitism in the world, and Israel's existence and actions seem to me more an excuse than a cause. The plight of the Palestinian people is being used to legitimise hatred of Jews that is not new, is not a result of the situation in the Middle East, but is the same old cancer of hatred that has characterised European attitudes to Jews for centuries. I happen to think that it is perfectly possible to criticise the Israeli government and security forces, identify Ariel Sharon as the war criminal that he is, oppose the building of settlements in the occupied territories, favour the existence of a Palestinian state, etc. without accepting even a whiff of antisemitism. <BR> <BR> <BR>Hrant, I am not being spineless in recognising a distinction between the expressions people use and their intent, especially in this emotional and historically charged discussion. Trust me, if I came to the conclusion that you actually are an antisemite, I wouldn't hold back from saying so. <BR> <BR>As a Catholic, I encounter antisemitism on a depressingly regular basis, most often from people who don't even realise that they are being antisemitic. They've simply grown up in a culture that has 1600+ years of ingrained prejudice behind it, and in a Church that has a long and problematic relationship with Judaism (despite the recent Vatican teachings against antisemitism). So maybe I'm particularly sensitive, but when I see careless language concerning Jews I'm very aware of how that is received by many people: with a nod and as a confirmation of their prejudices, and as a very hurtful threat against the security and lives of Jewish people. I don't have a problem with anyone being critical of Israeli policies &ndash; I even accept arguments about whether the state of Israel should exist as legitimate debate &ndash;, but please, people, be careful how you phrase things and don't let your protestations be fuel for hatred of Jews. That's all.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, I understand that there is antisemetism in the world, but relating this back to the entire idea of this discussion, do you honestly believe that by removing the swastika from the font will stop any antisemitism. It is my belief that the only way you will ever stop this form of persecution is by exposing it and making people aware of it. By removing the swastika, Microsoft has only swept another element under the rug, and this cannot be seen as a step forward against anti-semetism. Rather, this has hindered the cause, as people are able to make not thinking about this topic that much easier. Only when people become comfortable with and undertstand the meaning of the words Jewish, Jew, Nazi, etc. and the visual symbols that go along with them will people actually be moving in the right direction. <BR> <BR>By the way, I might be wrong when I'm saying this, but I don't believe the Hrant was saying that he thinks that the Star of David should be removed, he was just using this to show the fallacy of Microsoft's removal. Sorry if I interpreted it wrong, but whether or not he meant it that way, I whole-heartedly do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yet to have coffee. <BR> <BR>My complaint with the Jewish Human Rights Organization is the dismal record  of the State of Israel. I will refrain from posting any links because there are far to many. But I use the UN as my standard. Theirs and the complaints made by &quot;many&quot; other human rights organizations. I know people think &quot;human rights organizations&quot; are just a bunch of &quot;zannies&quot;. As you can see I made the same mistake about the Museum of Tolerance. Anyway, it's a bad habit to think human rights organization are run by zannies. <BR> <BR>Especially democratic zannies that lectures on human rights issues to developing nations on a regular basis, including China. So that been the case, it should be alright to complain about human rights abuses in places such as Israel where their isn't any. Hence the gag comment, sorry it was so distracting. Maybe I am too unkind. Maybe that is what the Jewish Human Rights is all about. It is only for the Jews. I don't know, sure looks that way to me. <BR> <BR><i>I happen to think that it is perfectly possible to criticise the Israeli government and security forces, <b>identify Ariel Sharon as the war criminal that he is,</b> oppose the building of settlements in the occupied territories, favour the existence of a Palestinian state, etc. without accepting even a whiff of antisemitism.</i>  John. <BR> <BR>You are aware that comments like that can make you a pretty unpopular chap. Someone might call you uninformed, or stupid. Or worse. Trust me you don't  want worse.  <BR> <BR><i>'Nazis disguised as Jews'</i> Well, I suppose that is hurtful, some think hateful but not as hurtful and hateful as what is happening in Palestine. <BR> <BR>But I have decided to put John's proposal to test. John is a nice fellow that knows nothing, it would seem, about Oxymorons. I do not believe you can criticize Israel without the result of hideous accusations. That appears to  be part of the &quot;Washington Lobby Spin&quot;. Do I sound cynical? Good because I am, it comes by me honestly?

Unfortunately when you get rid of the court, you don't get rid of the accusation. That's the beauty of the system. You never get to clear your name. <BR> <BR>Selective genocide. Isn't democracy fun? Listen to the Harps of America. <i>&quot;Using the law to target democratic countries was not the intent,&quot;</i> of the law, Destexhe said <BR> <BR>Only dictators should be persecuted for genocide! Is it OK if I gag now? Did Hitler ever win any elections? I think he did. Back off William, I am on your side here, remember, I really don't like Genocide. Unfortunately for some, I am not prejudiced about my complaint. <BR> <BR>I am not very complex. I do not approve of racism. I do not approve of murder. I do not appove of war. I do not approve of genocide. I believe freedom of religion is sacred. On the latter I have no choice, my God is the 'very remarkable consular Pooh Bah, consul for the entire planet' who by more than coincidence was helpful in Jerusalem. When I die I get to go to Spain. Did you hear thunder? Oh God, strike me now Consular! <BR> <BR>Yup, I am as Koo-koo as a Christian, but Koo-koo's have rights too. <BR> <BR><i>The law, adopted unanimously in 1993, seeks to prosecute war crimes and genocide wherever they occur.

I never said that removing the swastika from the MS fonts would achieve anything. In fact, I never related MS's decision, not once, to the issue of antisemitism. I only mentioned antisemitism when I saw statements in this thread that appeared to me to be antisemitic: as you say, the way to combat antisemitism is to expose it and make people aware of it. <BR> <BR>I do agree with Paul Nelson from MS that the context in which characters are used is important, and that there was no good reason for the Bookshelf 7 font to contain the swastika (nor the Star of David, for that matter, but I don't accept the parallel between the two symbols that Hrant is trying to make on Typographica), and that without a clear context justifying inclusion of such contentious symbols it is best to remove them.</div>

Would I be offended if a Muslim Typophile included the crescent moon in his picture? No, not at all, despite the fact that Muslim armies assaulted Christian lands in the Middle East and Europe for a heck of a lot longer than the crusades lasted. I don't see the crescent moon and think of all those centuries of religious warfare, and more than I think of a couple of decades of Israeli history when I see the Star of David. <BR> <BR>However, I am offended by the suggestion that, in the name of not offending other religions, we should supress all public religious expression.

		<div class="commentbody"><i>&hellip; dealing with the ambiguity of religious variety.</i> <BR> <BR>This is a very good phrase. Between totally supressing all religious expression and seeking to destroy all religions except your own is a huge area of genuine respect for other persons and their beliefs. Most religious people I know occupy this area, and accept the struggle of showing love and compassion while not glossing over the real disagreements and incompatibilities of one set of beliefs with another. <BR> <BR><i>I mind the syndrome that makes western Christians so uncomfortable with the fact that not everyone celebrates Christmas.</i> <BR> <BR>I think you are misinterpreting the phenomenon. I don't think Christians are uncomfortable with not everyone celebrating Christmas: in fact, a lot of observant Christians participate very little in the popular Christmas celebration. I do think that the shops and other businesses that rely on Christmas for huge consumer spending are uncomfortable about people not celebrating, and not celebrating by spending. This is why every year Christmas becomes less and less about the nativity of Christ, and an increasingly generalised 'Holiday Season'. Last year was something of a nadir in Canada, with many municipalities not putting up Christmas trees or calling them 'Winter Trees'. [To his great credit, the Jewish mayor of Toronto said 'This is silly: it's a Christmas tree and that's what we're going to call it'.] I don't like this silliness because I don't like the Orwellian distortion of it and the subversion of religious festivals by consumer capitalism. I'd rather there were no popular holiday celebration at all: I would still go to Mass on Christmas Eve, and my Jewish friends would still go to the synagogue during Chanukah. <BR> <BR>The irony of Chanukah being the Jewish component, as it were, of the syncretic secular holiday season is that the Maccabees were fighting against syncretism and ecumenism.</div>

January 6th in the Gregorian calendar <i>is</i> December 24th in the Julian calendar. On January 6th, the Roman Church will be celebrating the Epiphany, while the Armenian and other Eastern Churches will be celebrating Epiphany on &hellip; Janury 6th in the Julian calendar (i.e. January 19th in the Gregorian). It only gets really confusing with moveable feasts: I remember asking a Greek Orthodox how they calculated the date of Easter, to which he replied that he wasn't sure 'but it probably has something to do with not ending up on the same day as the Catholics'. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I haven't studied the history of this, but I've been told by those who seemed to know that the Dec 25 date was part of the compromise between the Roman state and the Church to get Christianity to be the state religion of the Roman empire. The Carnival started on that date in the Roman calendar; Sabbath worship was shifted to Sunday for similar reasons, as Romans had worshiped the sun. Also the Roman law of monogomy was accepted. There is no New Testament basis for a winter date of Jesus' birth, the only thing being a hint at a spring date, as I understand. Again, I have not studied this history, but it sounds quite interesting.  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Sabbath worship was shifted to Sunday for similar reasons, as Romans had worshiped the sun.</i> <BR> <BR>I believe the switch from Saturday to Sunday predates the establishment of Constantine by a good long time and has nothing to do with Roman pagan worship. Practically, it was a way to distinguish the early Church from the Jewish community from which its first members came, to clearly establish the distinctiveness of the Church as something other than a sect within Judaism. Theologically, the shift from the last day of the week to the first day of the week emphasises the resurrection and the new beginning in Christ.</div>

Irrelevant of your intentions. </i> <BR> <BR>It is possible, but seems to me unlikely. More to the point, it is speculative. If a Moslem reader had written to me at the time and asked why I had the cross there I would have told him, or if he had written to complain I would have explained why. I'm not inclined to police my actions just in case they might possible offend some person who might just possibly see them. <BR> <BR><i>In the same way that people of the Jewish faith (or sympathetic to it) may take certain indirect critical observations/comments as antisemetic, while others (myself included) made no such leap.</i> <BR> <BR>I have trouble reading the equating of Jews with Nazis as 'indirect critical observation'. If you miss the antisemitism in that, then I'm concerned. Only last Sunday, the French Cardinal Roger Etchegaray commented in an interview on 'the return of antisemitism in our Old Europe': '[Not] to recognize it, not to call it by its name, is an unconscious way of accepting it. &hellip;Its contours are vague and are not reduced to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. &hellip;The path that leads to Auschwitz is always before us and it starts with little weaknesses. Hence,' he insisted on the need for 'constant vigilance and frank solidarity with the Jewish communities.' <BR> <BR>As I mentioned earlier, there is a long established discourse of antisemitism, that uses stock phrases and associations to engender double standards and prejudice. The nature of this discourse is that individual phrases come loaded with a history of deliberately manufactured hatred that cannot be easily unloaded. <BR> <BR>There is, of course, anti-Moslem sentiment in both Europe and North America, but it has neither the antiquity, refinement or consistency of discourse that one finds with antisemitism. In North America, most anti-Islamic sentiment is attached to the so-called war on terror. In Europe, it is an issue of immigration and identity. But even in the current anti-Islamic discourse that surfaces in our societies, the cross is not an emblem or a rallying symbol for hatred; it is not, in fact, part of the discourse at all. Sure, idiot Bush mentioned the word 'crusade' once, and then quickly apologised and made sure it didn't happen again. The Pope's very strong condemnation of the American-British adventure in Iraq was a much more prominent statement of the orthodox Christian position regarding the war and made it clear that in no way could the invasion be considered a crusade in the mediaeval sense.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Anti-semitism certainly does exist (just like racism against any ethnicity). I agree it's old (Jews are old) and sophisticated, but that's just a quantitative issue. But a concern for the reckless behavior of the Jewish lobby in the US as well as Israel itself also exists. One does not preclude the other. <BR> <BR>It's pretty obvious to any objective and observant person that Israel is using the US like a big dumb cyclops to get away with the opression of Palestinians. What the &quot;Jewish communities&quot; need most of all is advice: that they get over it, and back off, if only for their own good. Many Israeli Jews are realizing this more and more, but their US &quot;brethren&quot; (not being at any risk of life themselves) are much thicker and fundamentalisic. In the same way that the victors of WWI took too many spoils and thereby laid a solid foundation for WWII (and the Holocaust!), there has to be <i>fairness</i> for <i>anybody</i> to live on this planet safely. And lest you resort to the buzz phrase &quot;don't blame the victim&quot;, know that I'm not interested in justifying genocide, just reducing it. I don't want more Jews to die. The best way to this is for things to be more fair than they are now. The only other option is annihilating everybody else. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Seventh-day Adventists usually make the arguments that 1) worship moved from Saturday to Sunday because of the Christians' desire to not be confused as a Jewish sect, and 2) Constantine decreed the first civil Sunday law on March 7, AD 321, which according to Adventists, reflected his background as a sun worshipper. They say the church later followed this example. <BR>However, <BR>Acts 20:7 says &quot;On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.&quot; The book of Acts was most likely written before 70 AD, therefore its events took place even earlier. <BR>1 Corinthians 16:1</div>
