  body: "Hmm...Well, first glance first and last logos are sort of web 2.0, the third
    one seems similar to a real estate logo. (roof image I guess) Personal preference
    would have to be the 4th one. It can stand very strong even without the gray box
    and seems the best fit for a \"high-end retailer\". Although the \"e\" seems a
    little squished in there because of the high ascenders all around it. So my second
    choice would be the one below it.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of retail?"

  body: "I agree with the first comment. All of these logos look like corporate offices,
    but I guess it depends on the kind of retail company.\r\n\r\ni think the curving
    of the box of the blue one, is more fitted to the type you've selected. "

    retailer.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of products will they carry? What type of image do
    they want to project?\r\n\r\nCheck out Toth Branding, Fabien Baron, and Robert
    Valentine. They have done a lot of identity work on luxury retailers/manufacturers\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: None of these looks high-end or retail. The first feel pharmaceutical, the
    rest are tech/tech/plumbing/cheap/tech. What does this retailer sell that makes
    this logo appropriate in your mind?

  body: I agree with all of the above, none looks high-end. Out of the proposals,
    number four is the most elegant, but the d feels clumsy. What are you aiming for?

  body: "Thanks for your comments, i`m thinking of the modern adelto logo shouts out
    modern, cutting edge and the more typical logos professional and luxury. i ideally
    need to bridge this gap and get a luxury modern logo. my brand designer has come
    up with some more suggestions.\r\n\r\nhttp://southcreative.com.au/clients/adelto/concepts/04.jpg\r\n\r\nthe
    company will be offering a range of high-end products, falper baths, bespoke kitchens
    etc. as well as certain building services. we will have an office in the UK and
    also Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nI need something that speaks to both markets and has universal
    appeal, i have also been thinking up suitable taglines to allow clients to gain
    an insight into the brand ust from the logo. i thought of contemporary living.
    old fashioned ethics (but old fashioned is probably not a word i should use, i
    basically meant, personal, approachable)\r\n\r\ncan anyone think of a tagline?
    Probably have the logo all in black, and if anyone knows of a font that is both
    modern and high-end please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nRichard\r\nhttp://www.adelto.co.uk"

  body: "When doing a logo.. here is the general process I have learned.\r\n\r\n#1
    Know your audience. You want to appeal to a UK and a Hong Kong Market. Hong Kong
    marketing is a much different ball game than the rest of the world. You're going
    to be competing alongside of a great deal of other companies that use bright colors
    to draw attention to themselves.\r\n\r\n#2 Brainstorm. Think of ideas related
    to your company, the products they will be selling and interesting ways to incorporate
    the idea into the typeface you select.\r\n\r\n#3 Research type options. You should
    be looking at examples of high-end design if you want to be high end yourself.
    In my experience, there's a lot of high-end logos that are usually just a type
    treatment, sometimes figuring out a new way to treat an old type face. (Making
    it look gold leafed for example, is the chintziest way to do it).\r\n\r\nLooking
    at the Falper logo, I can see where your ideas are coming from. Also, all the
    person doing who is giving you ideas from branding, is simply selecting modern
    fonts.. like Optima and Rotis and tracking them out. I think there's a more innovative
    solution...\r\n\r\nHere are some examples I thought might help. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=717
    - logos\r\nhttp://www.phase-two.co.uk/logos_frank_hudson.html - nice bespoke kitchen
    maker's logo\r\nhttp://www.habitathc.com/assets/images/New_Logo__3_.gif - high
    end modern furniture design, although this logo is pretty mediocre, it's still
    nice.\r\nhttp://www.uwm.edu/Libraries/special/currentevents/recentacq/recentacqimages/Wright2.jpg
    - the font for wright, although it screams 1920s or 30s deco, I think, is a good
    example of modern/classic treatment. clean, simple, refined.\r\n\r\nI hope this
    helped.. \r\n"

  body: "So I took a look at the new logos. Much different! Seems like you're headed
    in a different direction. The first ones that drew my eye would be the first and
    second one, even though I'm not so sure I'm liking that blue.\r\n\r\nThe all caps
    logos remind me of pixar, or maybe something a little more technology based, not
    high end furniture. It also seems to make it faceless (just in comparison...I
    think that's why I really like the lower caps, the letters seem to give the word
    a personality, good form. Just my opinion. I took a look at the website. Is that
    the final design? Are you trying to make the logo fit that style or are you going
    to adjust the web page to the finalized logo?\r\n\r\nI would also have to agree
    with you that \"old fashioned\" probably isn't a good tag. I read it and instantly
    thought of the magazine \"Country Living\". :)\r\n\r\nI mean, I'm terrible at
    thinking up tags, but maybe something more like \"cozy\" or something? Again,
    I'm bad at thinking up those things, but I gave it a try.\r\n\r\nThe font, to
    me, looks perfect. I mean if someone else can think of a better one then great.
    It seems very modern but has that swoosh to the ends that give it that softer
    feel and doesn't compromise the \"high end\" potential."

    shape would be too similar to the adobe reader logo. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.steffsoft.com/acrobat%20logo.png\r\n\r\nAt
    least that's what I first thought when I took a look at it. Good font though,
    I just think the \"Adel\" shape is too close to the \"Adob\" shape with that font."

  body: "Oh no that website was of an old company, i`m just putting it on everywhere
    i go to get backlinks on it so google ranks me higher, clever!!\r\n\r\ni`m still
    leaning towards the first logo, i know people on here think i should stick with
    the logo that says luxury, but i`ve had a fair bit of feedback and nearly all
    say that the top logo is more moder and contemporary, plus with an audiance of
    mainly 24 - 40 year olds a modern appearance is what i think the company needs.
    Plus no one else uses it, so it`ll stand out more.\r\n\r\nTagline...still think
    just contemporary living, but it does not really say we also offer building services,
    if i could get that in that would be good. \r\n\r\ni`m down to three logos in
    my little old head now, 1, 3 and 6 (all in black) maybe think of a symbol to add
    into it, but i do not want it too busy, so i might not bother!!\r\n\r\nthanks
    again for your great comments, keep them coming, they are all appreciated,\r\n\r\nRichard\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adelto.co.uk"

    down the page, its here:\r\n\r\nhttp://southcreative.com.au/clients/adelto/concepts/04.jpg\r\n\r\nthe
    underlying principle of the adelto logo is that it has to be modern and contemporary,
    therfore the FF Cocon logo was chosen and enhanced to have this effect, i could
    simply go along the lines of all caps, some old, but this is fresher, still needs
    some slight modifications, but sometimes people change is good!!!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adelto.co.uk"

  body: I think you need to do something to make it your own. Any old schmo can buy
    Cocon and set the name of his company in it. You can't own it until you do something
    unique.

    to gather peoples initial opinions of the font and go from there, the L has already
    had a minor modification and he is going to get underway with the rest of it on
    wednesday.\r\n\r\nI`ll put the final logo on this post, so if anyone wants to
    check it and give me there final opinions it would be appreciated, should be done
    thurs/fri.\r\n\r\nif anyone has any suggestions in the mean time please let me

  body: Very first thing that caught my attention was the black and white one. Where
    the ^ comes down and meets the letters, it has an overhang. The issue I see is
    that the overhang is far too small. You end up with a tiny bit of black still
    showing. Almost as if you meant to have it be flush, but didn't quite end up right.
    Looks like it needs to either be flush, or hang out more, so when someone sees
    it, they see it and move on and they don't stare and wonder why there is a speck
    of black showing.
