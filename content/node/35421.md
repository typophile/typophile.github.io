  body: The text font below is Palatino Bold (possibly a bit sqooshed)(top line),
    followed by Palatino Roman. Don't know what "Infratech" is though.

  body: The Infratech looks like Formula TS extra bold.

  body: "I think my answer is equivalent to the preceding one, although I haven't
    loked at 'Formula' yet, but I know this font by the FontBank name of <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/fortana.htm\">'Fortana'</a>.
    It didn't match anything in my Sans Serif Guide, and anything else I was able
    to find in other books. (I never have figured out what the real name for 'Fortana'
    is, and I doubt 'Formula' is its real name either, since the TS fonts seem mostly
    to be alias names for other things.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Here is a link for <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/formula/\">'Formula
    TS'</a>, and the Xbold version is the same as 'Fortana'. The design owner is supposed
    to be The Quick Brown Fox. I think that says enough about the 'real' name of this
    font for me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "A little browsing in the Jaspert 'Encyclopaedia of Type Faces' comes up with
    an Italian Sans with the same letterform structure called 'Forma', designed by
    a team led by Aldo Novarese for Niebolo in the mid-to-late-60's. I think this
    is the origin of 'Formula'/'Fortana', even though an Extrabold version is not
    shown in the samples. Nice of them not to change the name too much, isn't it?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Closer comparison of Forma with Formula shows that QBF added a chin/beard
    to the G and a tail to the j. Otherwise, I think the two typefaces are identical.\r\n\r\n-
