    English respectively, and of course why? For example will you be using Frutiger
    for German and Lexicon for English (<em>vice versa</em>) or a mix of both fonts
    for both languages?\r\n\r\nI ask because I\u2019m wondering whether you are looking
    for a gothic <em>or</em> traditional script style Japanese font."

  body: "Both German and English texts will be treated in the same way. \r\nEnglish
    and German texts will be only distinguished by colour - English in gray, German
    in black.\r\n\r\nSome texts are describing design projects (and there are pictures
    on these pages) - for these texts we intend to use a sanserif typeface, whereas
    other texts are written rather in a narrative style - therefore we think of using
    a serif typeface for these texts.\r\n\r\nI would like to have the same differentiation
    for these two kinds of text when choosing Japanese typefaces. \r\n\r\nI want to
    avoid any connotation with Gothic scripts. The whole thing should have a contemporary
    feel."

    Kaisho</a> is a more brush-like option that may also suit Ensched\xE9 Lexicon."

    two typefaces?\" \r\n\r\nIn Japan at least, when the question goes the other way
    around: \"What Latin face goes best with Ishi Mincho or Shaken Gothic?\", it is
    usually answered but Frutiger or Univers for their great ability to offer specific
    weights and widths to appear smoothly alongside the Japanese as that is used at
    different sizes. That's high end stuff, but the fundamental point is: if you plan
    on having good looking mixed scripts, choose the Kanji first, and then a Latin
    with the proper style set to \"match\" at the Kanji's different sizes. These days,
    with single-mastered Kanji for all sizes, I think that it goes double."

    Axis looks good together with Humanist Sans.\r\n\r\nShin-go is one of the most

    also uses it with Frutiger\r\n\r\nSorry for my poor English."
