  body: "<em>those kind of remarks belittles the talent of professional letterers
    and type designers.</em>\r\n\r\nUsually we just answer questions like this by
    saying ' It looks custom designed, but Snell Roundhand or Ballantines Script might
    be similar', and I suppose if Stephen had said it that way maybe Nick wouldn't
    have reacted. As Yves said, the poster intended no harm, and so it seems unnecessary
    to consider an innocent question (or the reply) as any sort of slight to type
    artists/designers. Regardless of the way the questions are worded, people are
    usually coming here to ask us for something that can re-create a certain typographic
    look, hopefully by telling them the exact typeface (digital, if possible) that
    was used, but failing that to offer something that might give a similar look without
    needing to be able to draw it yourself, or hire a designer to do it.\r\n\r\nThat's
    what we do here, isn't it? (Maybe with a little education about lettering artists
    and type designers thrown in, as a bonus.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Even very good custom script logotypes follow models, usually (in my experience)
    rather closely. Even though a handdrawn Bickham can be very different from a custom
    Bickham-based script, it's still a Bickham (not that this is, of course, just
    an example). \r\n\r\nFor example, if you read the writings of The Doyald (Young),
    he'll almost always describe how he bases each logo on an existing typeface, and
    he's one of the most talented logo artists around.\r\n\r\nI've sometimes thought
    that some very good letterers have a limited number of \"typefaces\" (types of
    writing that they have learned and that are part of their repertoire). Like a
    \"typeface\" typeface, only more flexible, and some of these typefaces can be
    the creation of the letterer him or herself. I don't know if that's a fair comparison
    though."

  body: I always like logos created from scratch, with a nice individual touch. So
    it's quite funny that this discussion comes up around the BON logo. I just happened
    to stumble over the ornaments on the sides of it, and they are taken straight
    from Wingdings. Nice.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bon_wingding_3636.jpg]

  body: "Perhaps what has happened in  recent years is that many people experience
    type and letterforms primarily through their computer and the font menu. It is
    easy to assume someone started with an existing typeface and made a logo or brand
    name. It is easy to fall in to the trap of assuming things came from a pull-down
    menu unless you have been in the business for long enough to remember otherwise.\r\nIn
    years past, hand lettering for such things was quite normal and expected. It was
    even easier to find a skilled lettering artist than it was to try and manipulate
    typeset forms. Today, there are fewer lettering artists who work the old fashioned
    way and billions of digital fonts available. A person can post an image here on
    this forum and in minutes get a close relative to a lettering sample, go to an
    online vendor, download and use it within the hour. Pretty amazing actually what
    a service folks like Mike, Patty, and Yves perform in minutes!\r\n\r\nChrisL"
