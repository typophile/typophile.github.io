  body: Oh, we just did a brilliant walk to the old city and ate on a terrace overlooking
    <a href="http://www.ilove-marrakesh.com/lavisite3_en.html">Jemaa El Fna</a>, but
    Sabine suddenly didn't feel very well so we're back at the hotel and she's taking
    a nap. Going out again in an hour or two. ;^)
