  like stitches on a wound but more elegant and flowing. I would be very happy to
  hear your suggestion. Thank you.\r\nPetter"

  body: Thank you sapitau for all your sugggestions. The image I have in my head though
    is less embroider and more sewing if that makes sense. I want the outline to be
    made up by the stitches, not embroider "crosses", hard to explain..

  body: Oh, I'm sorry looks like I'm more of an embroiderer myself. Stitched font
    is much harder to find I reckon (especially the elegant ones). Do you mean something
    like [[http://embird.com/sw/embird/letter.htm|this]]?? (or do it yourself if you
    have any Illustrator-skills)

    taking an interest.
