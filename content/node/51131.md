  body: Those three lines of black text in the bottom right needs to be left aligned
    or at lest spaced better. I got your concept, but I'm bugged by the lack of space
    between REDHOTISGETTINGHOTTER. Have you considered something like "Hot, hotter,
    red"?

  body: The black colour seems very harsh next to the other ones. - Have you considered
    using a wider typeface to fill the space better?

  body: If nothing else, spelling out "five" could help even up the wordspacing...
