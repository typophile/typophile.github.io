body: "As a result of learning the basics of letterpress in a paper offered by my
  university I have formed a strong interest in letterpress typography. I want to
  use this interest as a basis for my final research / design project, which extends
  over the course of a year. \r\n\r\nI understand that there is a current revival
  in letterpress typography, however I feel that the current use of letterpress is
  a pastiche of the past. In order for letterpress to be moderen and relevant to today
  it should display \"its felxibility in telling stories and providing current issues
  in current ways. I strongly feel that to achieve this the computer should be used
  in conjunction with letterpress technology.\r\n\r\nI am having some trouble with
  working out exactly where to go with this, but I think I need to identify a topic
  to test this out on, I would apreciate any thoughts on the topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "One may argue that the combination of computers and letterpress have contributed
    to letterpress' usage as \"pastiche\". I imagine a lecturer would suggest you
    explore the assertion that letterpress can be modern and/or relevant (and in which
    context?). \r\nI think that what makes letterpress special and unique is that
    it's not perfect, that it's more tactile than current printing technology. There's
    something about it that makes it warmer and friendlier than digital output.\r\nSo
    it may be relevant after all, just not in a commercial, large-scale kind of way.
    \r\nThe challenging part of doing research here on that topic is that many resources
    covering type history, letterpress and so forth are located on the other side
    of the world. But good luck though! "
