body: "The problem with the iPad is that it gently lures you away from getting any
  work done. You look up from its gorgeous screen to suddenly discover that it is
  well past midnight. All you've done is watched other people's sites, read their
  observations, admired their pictures or stared at any other way in which they expressed
  themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmittedly the thing did inspire me write down some [[http://www.prepressure.com/blog/ipad-first-impressions|first
  impressions]] and rant about how stupid iTunes handles [[http://http://www.prepressure.com/blog/to-backup-delete-all-your-data-first|iPad
  back-ups]]. I can only hope that it will become much more of a tool instead of a
  (web)-TV once I get past the initial fooling around phase.\r\n\r\n"
