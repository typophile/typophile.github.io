  have any recommendations? Of course I'm going to Pompeii and Herculaneum, and Naples'
  exquisite ossuaries. If you have any suggestions of manuscript, typography, printing
  museums, and/or cemeteries and restaurants for this calligrapher/typophile/gourmet/Goth,
  they would be much appreciated! \r\n\r\nThank you so much,\r\nGrendl.\r\n\r\ngrendl_lofkvist@yahoo.com\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Grendl\r\n\r\nIt wasn't too long ago that I was in the Naples area. Pompeii
    has some lovely examples of ancient hand-tooled type.\r\n\r\nDepending on where
    you're planning on going, it may be a little out of the way, but the paper museum
    in Amalfi is a real insight - they only stopped making paper in the sixties, and
    the Vatican still source their paper from them (now produced in an off-site fanctory),
    due to cotton's longevity as opposed to paper derived from wood. If there's a
    guide they're quite happy to show you the old factory with the old equipment,
    including how the cotton pulp is gathered and pressed. The tradition for local
    paper making is also being kept alive by a workshop just down the road. Will actually
    be writing a blog post about it shortly.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your travels.\r\n\r\nJames"
