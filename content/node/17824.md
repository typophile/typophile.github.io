  everybody!!!\r\n\r\nThis is Panos Koutsodimitropoulos. On 2002, I did my MA on <strong>'Olympic
  Sport Pictograms'</strong> and ever since then I try to collect as mush info as
  I can regarding all the visual elements of Olympic Games. My aim is to create an
  educational web site, in which there will be all the info for <strong>'Olympic Games
  visual identity'</strong>. Everything that is related to Olympic Games' visual elements
  and you happen to know or heard about it may be very valuable to my research.\r\n\r\nThe
  final web site will present for every modern Olympiad the following:\r\n\r\n<strong>a)
  the basic visual elements</strong>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Emblems (bid, main, secondary
  ones for: environment, culture, volunteerism, torch relay)</li>\r\n<li>Mascots (in
  sport action, variations)</li>\r\n<li>Sports and information pictograms</li>\r\n<li>Pattern
  (in http://www.athens2004.com is called 'secondary graphics' and in http://www.torino2006.org
  is called 'Look of the Games')</li>\r\n<li>Typography</li>\r\n<li>Colours</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>b)
  design applications, such as:</strong>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Wayfinding</li>\r\n<li>Posters</li>\r\n<li>Medal</li>\r\n<li>Torch</li>\r\n<li>Web
  site</li>\r\n<li>Print items</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSo, any help is welcomed. You
  could help me by giving me reference for: an article that you have read concerning
  Olympic Games visual identity, a book that contains similar data, digital files
  and anything you may think off. If you want to send me digital files, please use
  my e-mail: <a href=\"pkoutsod@gmail.com\">pkoutsod@gmail.com</a>.\r\n\r\nThanks
  is advance. The project will be done inside 2006. So, stay tuned!!!\r\n\r\n:-)\r\n\r\nPanos
  Koutsodimitropoulos"
