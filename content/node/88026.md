  it, we delivered! Pilar Cano swiftly responded to the user's requests for additional
  weights for [[http://www.type-together.com/Edita|Edita]]. In this upgrade, we are
  proud to present Edita Book, a slightly darker style of this gorgeous typeface specially
  engineered for continuous and extensive reading. Edita Book supports the same huge
  character palette as the rest of the styles in the family and the same beautiful
  texture. But this time it offers a specific solution for those applications where
  reader fatigue is part of the designer's problem.\r\n\r\nMore information at: [[http://www.type-together.com/Edita]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/edita_10-kopia_5614.gif]"
