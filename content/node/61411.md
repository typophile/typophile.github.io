  body: "The course is about designing type. The approach is agnostic. Drawing, font
    editors or illustration applications are the students choice. I encourage students
    to use FontLab Studio 5, and last semester most did. But some chose to do the
    work in Adobe Illustrator and some chose to draw with paper and pencil.\r\n\r\nWithout
    using a font editor, the course essentially becomes \"Alphabet Design\", but ultimately
    it is about drawing letters and \"system design\".\r\n\r\n"

    of 34th Street to the North and 14th Street to the South but yet has the same
    number of traffic lanes. :)\r\nYou'd think, to preserve the mathematical balance,
    24th street would be the boulevard, not 23rd.\r\n\r\nI once taught a class on
    migrating networks when MS Windows 2000 Server first came out, not far away but
    on the west side.\r\nBecause of the prep I had to do, I ended up learning more
    than the guys I was teaching, by far.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n(Is auditing allowed?

    Some of them can handle it, but I don't think it makes sense for anybody who tries

  body: "When I taught undergraduate type design I always expected the students to
    finish their typeface in the allotted time (15 weeks 2:40 per session). One weight,
    full character set (western european latin) with one OpenType feature. I explained
    to them that a professional would do the work in about 200 hours, so they should
    allot at least twice that much during the course of the semester.\r\n\r\nI made
    it clear at the beginning of the course that if they didn't finish, they would
    fail the course. Without that pressure they had no incentive to work hard on their
    projects. \r\n\r\nDid they make good type? Hardly. Some of them came close, most
    were obvious first attempts. But they were exposed to the process, they learned
    how truly difficult making type was, and they all had a deep sense of accomplishment
    when they used their newly finished font to design a poster showing it off. Most
    told me it was the best design course they ever took.\r\n\r\nContinuing Ed is
    a different environment, but I still expect the commitment to finish what one
    starts."

    the bar high, and see who can get over it. If no one can, you can always lower

    would be surprised at the tools we have now. For instance, you and I can be connected
    (along with 12 or more other students) and if you are teaching I will be able
    to see your computer as you draw a character in FontLab, while listening to you
    explain what you are doing. I can't see how that would be more difficult than
    in a classroom.\r\n\r\nIn fact, with the software, if I have FontLab, you (as
    the instructor) can see my FontLab screen as I try to do an exercise, and you
    will quickly see where I am going wrong on some task I have misinterpreted.\r\n\r\nI
    firmly believe type design is an ideal subject for online learning, because the
    numbers of people who are interested in learning from an expert are generally
    scattered in many different locations. Only those living in the megopolises get
    to take courses like this one otherwise."

    a big difference between a\r\nrequired course and an \"adult\" class: in the former
    it's difficult\r\nto have too-low expectations...  :-/\r\n\r\n> I firmly believe

    I've used to great effect with 30+ students (not for type\r\ndesign however) is
    NetSupport*. It's not cheap, but it can do almost\r\nanything, including transmitting
    audio, allowing remote supervision\r\nand even taking control of a user's computer
    (yes, scary... for them :-).\r\n\r\n* http://www.netsupport-inc.com/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    pretty sure that online learning is the foundation of type design instruction
    for many people. The problem is that it hits a wall at the Typophile crit thread.
    Screencasting and sending PDFs proofs of design around would be a huge plus in
    learning type design for people not near cities with type designers."

    And a poster or some other piece of collateral that shows that the font  functions.
