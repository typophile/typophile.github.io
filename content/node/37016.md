  John Smiths Printer\u2019s Grammar, London 1755\r\n\r\nBlackletter consists of as
  many sorts as a common font of Roman; \u017Fave that the first has two different
  r's, one of which is called <strong>ragged r</strong>, and is particulary used after
  letters that round off behind, whether they be capitals, or lowercase sorts. Thus
  thes are properly put after the following capitals, viz. B, D, G, D, P, V, W; and
  after these lowercase letters, viz. b, d, h, o, p and w.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/37002\r\n\r\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rundes_r
