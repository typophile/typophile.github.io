  my BFA in Graphic Design. As a graduation gift from my parents, i'm getting an all
  expenses paid trip to Europe. I'm looking for opinions on where exactly I should
  go. Preferably somewhere with good design to study and interesting sights to see.
  (A good nightlife wouldn't hurt, either). I was leaning toward Berlin, but I wanted
  to broaden my options by polling some of you who live in or have visited Europe
  before. \r\n\r\nTo recap, my \"checklist\" of a good candidate:\r\n1) Active, on-display
  design culture\r\n2) Interesting sights\r\n3) Good places to catch some live music\r\n4)
  Just good to visit in general\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestions? :)\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nEric"

    right now. You can make out that it's there, but it's hard to get a good look.
    Rome is chock full of other inscriptions, though. There are some real gems in
    the Forum.

    before, but that's one place I'd love to go to someday. Amsterdam has some nice
    things too. I have to admit I wasn't a type fanatic before going to Europe in
    1999, and I hadn't even taken a graphic design course yet, but I know if I went
    back now I'd just eat up all the design.\r\n\r\nOf course, Italy is home of the

    I've never even been on a train before! \r\n\r\nA question:\r\n\r\nWe're (My girlfriend
    and I) looking very seriously at Berlin and surrounding areas.  (However, this
    is definitely subject to change, as I find all European places intensely interesting)
    How much German should I know while in the Berlin area? I want to make myself
    understood, but I also don't want to be so basic that I'm talking like a German
    caveman. \r\n\r\n<em>Zurich and Antwerp</em> are two other places we're interested
    in...The printing museum in Antwerp looks VERY interesting (for me, at least).
    \ Is it feasible to stay in Berlin and visit these other cities?\r\n\r\n<em>I've
    got 2 weeks, and I want to see a lot, but also be relatively low key as far as
    amount of time traveling.</em> \r\n\r\nThank you all so much,\r\n\r\nEric"

  body: "I speak German fluently, albeit with a horrendous Baltimore accent. However,
    one can get by as a tourist quite well in Germany with just English. In my experience,
    this has been a little more difficult in Italy and France. Here in Germany, though,
    many will immediately switch to English when they begin to hear me talk, which
    is not necessary, although I always appreciate that they are trying to be helpful.\r\n\r\nIf
    you stay in Berlin and want to go to Antwerp and Zurich, it would be best to take
    the train to one of them, and then stay in that city for a night or two (or longer!)
    and then return to Berlin. Zurich must be 8 hours away from Berlin, even via fast
    train. Maybe Antwerp can be reached in four? But don't forget Dessau and Weimar.
    These are easy day trips from Berlin."

    overnight train though, http://www.citynightline.ch/citynightline/view/eng_index.shtml.
    if you book those things early you'll get it quite cheap, too.\r\n\r\nif you only
    have two weeks though, i'd hardly do more than 2 cities. for me 4 days is the
    smallest amount of time possible to get to know a city (a tiny little bit), and
    esp. with you having never been to europe, maybe one or two cities really would
    be the best.\r\n\r\nin zurich you should easily be able to get by with english
    only, just the other day i helped two indonesian girls to find their way around

    to visit other places than Amsterdam too.\r\n\r\nFor a two week trip it's worthwile
    to visit East Berlin, there's certainly a lot going on currently. \r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Just wanted to add as a human, not as a designer, that I'll rather travel around
    Eastern Europe, and not only because it's cheaper and the food is better. It's
    hard to explain, but I feel like the places are more alive. You also get along
    with a very slow english and making signs. Maybe a train trip like Prague-Krakow-Budapest-Kroatia?
    I've never been to Kroatia, but I think maybe this summer.."
