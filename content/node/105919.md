  heard about it). Is it the same as Grostesque, because I saw it used for typefaces
  such as Akzidenz and Franklin Gothic. If not, can you please tell me about some
  of its characteristics.\r\n\r\nI basically know(I think) all the general classes
  but can someone list them and their defining characteristics.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Perhaps the most widely used system is the Vox-ATypI classification. For
    listing and defining characteristics there is a wiki at:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox-ATypI_classification\r\nNote
    two different uses of \"realist\" from the wiki:\r\n1. \"'Realist sans-serif'
    is a commonly encountered synonym for neo-grotesque.\"\r\n2.  \"The transitional,
    realist or r\xE9ales are the typical typefaces of the traditional period, particularly
    embodying the rational spirit of the Enlightenment\"\r\n\r\n---start extended
    quote--\r\nNeo-grotesque typefaces are derived from the earlier grotesque faces,
    but generally have less stroke contrast and a more regular design. Unlike the
    grotesque, they generally do not have a spurred \"G\", and the terminals of curves
    are usually slanted. Many neo-grotesque faces have a large degree of subtlety
    and variation of widths and weights to accommodate different means of production
    (Hot type, foundry type, phototypesetting, see History of typography, 20th century).
    \ \"Realist sans-serif\" is a commonly encountered synonym for neo-grotesque.
    Examples of neo-grotesque lineal typeface include Helvetica and Univers.\r\n---end
    extended quote---\r\n\r\nDon"
