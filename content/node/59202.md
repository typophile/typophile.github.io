  being interpreted as rude.\r\n\r\nRegarding my use of names, using last names is
  a convention in academia (science). Consistently using people's last names between
  disciplines (typography and psychology) assists me with my memory. As I have a neurological
  and seizure disorder, memory formation is a significant problem with me as a side
  effect of my seizures and the associated medications. I will most likely continue
  using this convention. No disrespect is intended."

    where you're coming from. Composers, conductors, and performers are always referred
    to by their last name, and this is also true in the visual arts and dance.\r\n\r\nTo
    clarify, this trend, of course, is in forums of discussion and writing. Face-to-face
    interaction or introductions, etc. would always include a title (Dr.) or first
    name. \r\n\r\nI have not come across your potentially rude use of names, but if
    this is all you mean, I wouldn't worry about it!"

    sounds a lot like a verb that\u2019s used a lot in Dutch. (Imagine waking up in
    class every 24 seconds \u2014 that will recondition you in a whiff\u2026)\r\n\r\nOn
    a side note: last names that sound like nasty words should be avoided.\r\n\r\n.

    that carries with it positive connotations. As in \"Dean Of Student Affairs\".\r\nI've
    got Fink.\r\nNot fair. But it IS my name.\r\nAnd that's what my high school football
    coach called me. Always.\r\nDo whatever feels right to you. :)\r\n"

    that it is quite in keeping with the content of your posts, which is quite impersonal,
    free of ad hominem arguments. In fact, it puts me on guard not to fall into that
    bad habit!\r\n\r\nBut I do wonder how to address you. What's your preference?"
