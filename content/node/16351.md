  and distinguished (i hope elegant), with good legibility. The readers are 40-80.
  But I will have some 30 year olds glancing at it once in a while and I don't want
  it to be overlooked. Trying for a freshened up early 20th century experience. \r\n\r\nI've
  been using Filosofia, but not sure about the heaviness. Might be tiring on my older
  readers.\r\n\r\nDoes it matter that these guys played baseball?"

    them out for a taste of how they look. For more just call them. I think they will
    be willing to send to PDF samples set in your text and layout. I don''t know if
    Fenway, which is used by Sports Illustrated, is generally available, but you should
    ask. <a href="http://www.connare.com/type.htm">Magpie</a> I think is the new face
    by Vincent Connaire, which looks very interesting, but also don''t know if it

    a 2 base error and walked the pitcher but that would not be crickett :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"
