  in the process of developing an online design archive to aid design education and
  research, as there appears to be a lot of focus on sustainability by design, however
  very little on sustainability of design.\r\n\r\nAs an in-house designer, my font
  selection has been limited to a mere 5, and the more I speak to other designers
  I find that they are having the same problem. As more focus is put on legibility
  and readability, the range of usable fonts that are deemed acceptable appears to
  get smaller and smaller.\r\n\r\nMy question is, what happens to all those great
  fonts that represent sometimes years of work, as well as decades of culture? There
  are museums and book sure, but I am yet to find a constantly growing record of the
  design industry online.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the online design archive, is not only
  to create a permanent record of design created by designers, but also to encourage
  creativity and a sense of social and cultural sustainability within design and the
  design community in general through the support of peers; for students, researchers
  and academia.\r\n\r\nI am now looking for a small test group of designers to interview
  for this, to find out their views on the viability of an online archive for this
  purpose and also their views on supporting design education. Hopefully they will
  also be able to give feedback on the archive itself and how it can be improved to
  act as a positive tool throughout the industry.\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate
  any and all feedback on this, and if being interviewed or helping as a tester for
  the site is something that you may be able to help with then all the better.\r\n\r\nI
  ought to add that this is part of my MA research that I am hoping to carry through
  and sustain past the end of the course, and in theory is to act as a not for profit
  operation.\r\n\r\nI can be contacted through here or by email at contact@christophernallen.com.\r\n\r\nI
  look forward to hearing from you, and thanks again.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\nChris
  Allen\r\n"

    seriously, is this type design or typography? digital fonts or all technologies?
    What would it look like to use, and what would it offer that's not already online?"

    5\u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nOnly having access to five commercial typefaces and whatever
    free faces you use, in any size you want, is still a pretty good situation for
    a in-house designer. Plenty of in-house designers are doing almost all of their
    work in a house style that only includes three typefaces if one counts using Verdana
    on the corporate web site. It\u2019s no secret that the big trade-off of in-house
    work is less variety for a more secure and conventional job.\r\n\r\n<cite>As more

    as opposed to what? Was there some time in the past when fonts (novelties aside)
    weren\u2019t meant, and chosen, to be legible and readable?\r\n\r\n<cite>\u2026what
    happens to all those great fonts that represent sometimes years of work, as well
    as decades of culture?</cite>\r\n\r\nSome great typefaces, like great music and
    poems and paintings, will fall by the wayside and be swept into the big dustbin
    of history. That\u2019s the way the world works. We move on because we can only
    carry so much of the past forward without running out of arms. It\u2019s like
    in that old Van Halen video: \u201CRight now God is killing moms and dogs, because
    he has to.\u201D\r\n\r\n<cite>I am yet to find a constantly growing record of
    the design industry online.</cite>\r\n\r\nThe internet is still pretty new. Building
    and maintaining online archives of anything, especially copyrighted designs that
    may be owned by clients, is expensive and challenging. Far more challenging than
    maintaining hard copies of design annuals and survey books. Keeping said archive
    working and up to date over decades is even harder. This is not a task many organizations
    want to take on."

    I thought quite the opposite was true!</em> and <em>More focus as opposed to what?
    Was there some time in the past when fonts (novelties aside) weren\u2019t meant,
    and chosen, to be legible and readable?</em>\r\n\r\nMy point is that as more research
    is done into legibility and readability, I have noticed that people (designers)
    are increasingly using the same fonts. I have noticed a large increase in the
    use of DIN recently (as one example). I appreciate that there are increasingly
    more fonts available, I read somewhere that in 1996 there were somewhere around
    60,000 known and regular typefaces available, so who knows how many there are
    now? But when companies are told 'these are the top 10 fonts' then increasingly
    they go with those fonts to comply with legislation (not that I think this is
    a bad thing), so why shouldn't there be something that says \"what about these
    great ones\". I personally think that all forms of design are an important piece
    of culture and that they should be recognised and remembered as such, just like
    music and art. THey only fall by the wayside if we let them.\r\n\r\n<em>More seriously,
    is this type design or typography? digital fonts or all technologies? What would
    it look like to use, and what would it offer that\u2019s not already online?</em>\r\n\r\nWith
    the main basis for work in the archive being graphic design (whether it be print
    or digital, etc.) the idea is to have the type referenced alongside the work so
    that not only the design but the type can be researched in an easily navigable
    format. As for what it would offer, it would offer an archive where you can search
    by agency/designer, font, year, awards, etc. I'm looking to create something that
    would cover an international audience, and would grow based on industry and peer
    participation.\r\n\r\n<em>...Keeping said archive working and up to date over
    decades is even harder...</em>\r\n\r\nI'm unfortunately very much aware of this,
    and sometimes feel as though I have bitten off more than I can chew, but I feel
    that it is important to look into the feasibility of the format, and how it could
    be improved and how that improvement would benefit the model.\r\n\r\n<em>All those
    great unused fonts end up in our landfills. I encourage everyone to please consider
    putting them up for adoption at your local font shelter instead.</em>\r\n\r\nThat
    may seem funny, but one idea I had was to create a gallery of sorts where designers
    create self initiated type art, in whatever format, this could then be referenced
    to the type and create examples of the type in use that they could be viewed by
    others. Why not have a 'typograhical graveyeard', somewhere where we can remember
    all those old and great fonts that for some reason or another won't be used again,
    something where designers go \"this was my favourite font and why, but now I can't
    use it, thanks [insert font name here] for being a great piece of design\" and
    then create some sort of homage to that font?"
