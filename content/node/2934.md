body: I&#39;m setting a project using p22&#39;s beautiful Operina fonts for display,
  and I&#39;ve found that practically none of my text ornaments look good next to
  Operina; they are all too sharp-edged and formal.  Can someone recommend me a source
  of antiquey-looking fleurons, preferably an inexpensive one? &#40;I am a poor student;
  for me, Operina was an extravagance, but a bloody satisfying one.&#41;

  body: I guess the best thing to do would be to design your own ornaments, in a similar
    style of Operina. <BR>Or don&#39;t use ornaments at all. I mean, you&#39;re already
    using a calligraphic typeface with decorative alternatives. <BR>

  body: or do something like printing them out, crumpling up the paper, then scanning
    them back in. Maybe?
