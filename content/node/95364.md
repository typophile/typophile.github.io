    and [[http://shop.cooperhewitt.org/common/images/products/large/AM_MAXBILL_WALLCLOCK.jpg|here]]\r\nLooks
    custom to me or even designed by Max Bill himself. Makes me thinking (a lot) to
    some modified (manually rounded, /4 redrawn...) [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile/t-regular-extended/|Eurostile
    Extended]]. Another point giving credit to the Eurostile track is it's actually
    [[http://www.pagels.de/JunghansLogo_claim_P432.jpg|Junghans logotype]] font (and
    almost everywhere on [[http://www.junghans.de|their website]])\r\nSome more in
    the same vein: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eurostile-candy/|Eurostile
    Candy]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/naghachian/aban/|Alban]] (another rounded
    Eurostile), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/reversal/|Reversal]] (another
    Eurostile clone), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/saturn/|Saturn]] (one
    more Eurostile), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-identikal/reaction/|Reaction]],

  body: "Yes, it has an Eurostile vibe, but I think the construction is still pretty
    different (for example, look at |2| and |7|, other than |4|). \r\nAnyway, good
    detective work, as always! "
