		<div class="commentbody">The answer is often both. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OS X has had various font related bugs. One was  associated with how it maps glyphs to characters for fonts with extended language support in apps that are not doing Unicode. Sometimes weird stuff would show up in what ought to have been the regular MacRoman range. I believe this was fixed in 10.3.6 IIRC. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OS X and InDesign both have a notion of being able to identify the primary codepage of a font. This is an obviously questionable idea in today's universe of multi-lingual fonts, but they try to do it. InDesign uses this info to group fonts in its font menus, so all the Cyrillic fonts will be in one group below the western fonts, and so on. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First, in addition to the obvious problems with the idea itself, there have been errors in the heuristics used by both OS X and InDesign to do this. InDesign has fixed some of its errors, but if the font is installed at the OS level, InD will simply query the OS for info. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe recognizes that there is a real problem here, and hopes to significantly improve this area in the future. However, I can't comment specifically on features and bug fixes for unannounced future products. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even if it solved the problem, I wouldn't recommend labeling your fonts as supporting codepages they do not in fact support. That sort of thing is bound to get you into trouble. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If within a given family, some fonts are sorting differently than others, I would check your settings for supported codepages and make sure they are consistent for all fonts in the family. After that, I'd try cleaning both the OS X font cache and the Adobe font cache files. Also see if the behavior is the same if the font is installed in a private Adobe fonts location rather than in the Mac OS. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So this is a problem that Apple and/or Adobe will fix eventually, so mucking around with adding unsupported codepages (even though it seems to work, at least in some cases) should be avoided. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the mean time, I tried a bunch of stuff this morning trying to change things in the fonts, clearing caches, restarting, voodoo, standing on my head while crossing my fingers, etc. with no success.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Out of desperation, I waded through the message boards at the FontLab Forums (why in hell there is no way to search them is beyond me, and half the time Safari tries to download the .msnw pages instead of displaying them, arrgh!), and lo and behold, I found a work-around devised by John Butler that appears to be reliable and doesn't involve doing anything dodgy to the fonts themselves.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here it is: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In addition to installing the problematic OTF font in the usual way (I use FontBook), put a copy in [your hard drive name here]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts/ . <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is actually slightly modified from John's version. He says to put them in a folder for a specific Adobe application, but this one is used by all of them (presumably) and seems more logical. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The way it seems to work is that Adobe apps look in Adobe's font directories first, correctly identify the main script supported and place it in the correct section of the font menu. The other copy installed in the system font directory is ignored, but makes the font available to non-Adobe apps. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't know if a similar procedure would work with Windows. I don't have Windows copies of Adobe apps to test. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This general idea was touched on above when Thomas mentioned moving fonts to Adobe's private font locations for testing purposes, but that hides the fonts from other apps. The key thing that makes this work is putting copies of problem fonts in both Adobe and system locations. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So far, I haven't found any problems with this work-around, and it seems like it would be a simple enough procedure to explain to customers, not that this sort of thing should be necessary in the first place.</div>

I strongly recommend that every developer whose fonts are affected by this bug makes an archive with a documented case (detailed description, sample fonts, screenshots), puts that archive somewhere on your website (not publicly linked) and then writes and submits a bug report on that to Adobe and Apple. Your bug report should include a detailed description of the problem and a link to the archive containing the attachments.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Please use the bug report forms:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.adobe.com/misc/bugreport.html">http://www.adobe.com/misc/bugreport.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/bugrptform.html">http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/bugrptform.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you wish, you can also submit a copy of the bug report to us (adam at fontlab dot com).

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">BTW, the reason many Adobe multilingual OpenType fonts do not exhibit this buggy behavior is&hellip; that there used to be (I'm not sure if there still is) a mis-behavior (sort of &quot;buglet&quot;) of the Adobe FDK for OpenType that automatically turned on the flag indicating support for the Greek codepage even if just the Omega and the mu characters were included.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As we know, these characters are included in most Western and also Western+CE fonts because they're in the MacOS Roman codepage. According to the spec and general reason, a flag indicating support for a given codepage in a font should only be set if the font includes all or, at least, most characters of that codepage. But indeed, the Adobe FDK for OpenType logic that controlled the codepage support flags used to be *very liberal*.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Therefore, a large majority of Adobe OpenType fonts &ndash; even those that only contain Omega and mu &ndash; indicate the support of the Greek codepage. This leads to various problems in applications such as Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer, Firefox etc. For example, under certain circumstances, Internet Explorer may pick one of these fonts as the basic text font for Greek even if the font only contains these two Greek glyphs.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since FontLab 4 uses the Adobe FDK for OpenType (AFDKO) code to produce OpenType fonts, in the 4.0 and (I believe) 4.5 versions, FontLab behaved similarly. When an OpenType PS (.otf) font was produced, FontLab 4.0 and 4.5 ignored the Supported Codepages settings in the Font Info dialog and used the very &quot;liberal&quot; logic of the AFDKO code to generate the flags.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A side-effect of this mis-behavior was that, indeed, the presence of the Greek flag prohibited most of AFDKO- or FontLab-made OpenType PS fonts from being listed in the non-Western part of the font list in Apple and Adobe applications.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So the bug in the Adobe applications e.g. InDesign, and in Mac OS X was initially overlooked due to a bug in the AFDKO code that was used by Adobe to produce their OpenType fonts, and is also used by FontLab.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I explained above, FontLab 4.0 and 4.5 ignored the Supported Codepage settings in Font Info when making OpenType PS fonts and used the AFDKO auto-logic. Since the stand-alone AFDKO version does not have explicit means to set the codepage flags, the use of the auto-logic in the stand-alone AFDKO did make sense (although the problem of course was that the logic was flawed.) But since FontLab has the Supported Codepage dialog to set these fields explicitly, the product should use them rather than always use the AFDKO logic. So with FontLab 4.6, we stopped using the AFDKO logic and started using the Font Info settings (that were always used in OpenType TT fonts, BTW).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At that moment, the Apple/Adobe problem with listing the OpenType PS fonts in the non-Western section manifested itself. So far, it was &quot;covered&quot; by the overzealous AFDKO logic that unvoluntarily set the Greek flag. But of course with FontLab 4.6, the users did not explicitly set the Greek flag, since logically, this does not make sense. But indeed, the fonts without that flag tend to show up in the non-Western section&hellip;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course setting flags for codepages that are not truly supported in the font is a bad idea. This was a bad idea in AFDKO, it was bad that most Adobe OpenType fonts have this flag set.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So the thing is: a superflous Greek codepage flag makes some applications (Word, IE etc.) think that the font supports full Greek. But this manifests itself only to people using Greek, which is a minority. The absence of the Greek codepage flag makes other applications (InDesign, various OS X apps) put the font into the non-Western section. This clearly affects many more users, namely all Roman script users in West, Central and East Europe, in North America and all around the world.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Setting the Greek flag is a hack. Yet, I believe this is &quot;less worse&quot; than not using it. After Apple and Adobe have fixed their applications, the font developers can update their fonts and remove the superflous Greek flag.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;It's Greek to me&quot; truly gets a new meaning here&hellip;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam</div>
