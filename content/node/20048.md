  body: That is really nice! I bet it is custom, but ya never know. It's a bit reminiscent
    of both Randumhousoe Doghouse from House Industries but much prettier than either.

  body: Good find, Patty. I noticed that cover too. It's by <a href="http://www.gray318.com">Jonathan
    Gray</a>. I'm trying to find out what came first, but obviously someone was an
    influence on the other.
