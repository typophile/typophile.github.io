body: "This sample was sent to me to see if I could ID this text font. I searched
  my Sans Font ID Guide and (arbitrarily) the sans fonts at Veer, and came up with
  nothing that matched. The 'y' is about the only oddball letter I can see here. T-26
  Flux matches the general  shapes, but the details are not the same. \r\n\r\nAnyone
  recognize this one?"
