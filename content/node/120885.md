  body: Confirming Eurostile Extended Regular and Black Italic with some little editions
    (opening counters and removing some stroke parts). [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/microgramma|Microgramma]]
    could do the job as well but as no version comes with Italics, you'd have to manually
    slant it.
