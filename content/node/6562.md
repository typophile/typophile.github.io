  body: Thanks for the suggestions so far.  The suggested fonts were great, but not
    quite what I am looking for.  A Northstar, or maybe a better way to describe would
    be a nativity star &#40;four point star with the vertical axis longer than the
    horizontal&#41;.  I will also look into the possibility of creating a font with
    this feature.  However, further suggestions are appreciated and again thanks for
    the suggestions given.
