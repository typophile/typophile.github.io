body: "I am designing an Armenian font (as many of you know by now). It started as
  a small project, converting some T1 fonts that I had done in 1987 or something into
  OTF, with only a three liga features. As I worked on the fonts refining them I started
  adding more features. Most of the features were somewhat easy. With a few trials
  I was able to do them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I got stuck on one set of features:
  Contextual Positioning of Marks. The Armenian language has four marks (comma, exclamation
  mark, question mark, and emphasis mark) that are positioned above the glyphs. The
  problem of positioning these marks above the glyphs has proven somewhat difficult.
  I wish to raise or lower the position of the mark depending on the glyph that precedes
  it, and I cannot find the method to do it. I am using FontLab 4.6 on a Mac OS X
  10.4.2, and I want to create OTF CFF fonts. I do not have a PC or Virtual PC to
  run VOLT (there is a way of using VOLT for OTF CFF somewhere in this forum).\r\n\r\nIs
  there any way I can do this using FL, or should I go buy me a PC?"

    the OTL tables by hand using TTX :)

    OTL tables by hand using TTX?"

  body: "I tried VOLT, and I checked TTX. VOLT is definitly better because you can
    see the result as you do the editing, but TTX is much faster. It would take me
    a little while to prepare what needs to be done, and then I could add the features
    by hand using TTX. Most importantly I won''t have to buy a PC.\r\n\r\nThe only
    thing that remains now is the syntax of the ttx file. How do I do it? Is there
    a tutorial?"

  body: "I'm not aware of a TTX tutorial that would provide the kind of detail you
    need. The best approach would probably be to find a font that uses contextual
    mark positioning (most likely an Arabic font, e.g. one of the new Linotype OT
    Arabic fonts), dump the GPOS table in TTX, and see how it works.\r\n\r\nI know
    some people who have successfully worked with VOLT on a Mac within a Windows emulator."
