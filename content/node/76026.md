    which the sample doesn''t appear to have. '

  body: Oops, I just looked again and saw Spire Expert, which has the same <strong>U</strong>
    as the sample. Sorry, Riccardo, you were right.

  body: Part of the /S, Spire appears to be the closest match I found... The /S terminals
    don't match at all. Spiked for Spire, here, there are flat, more like [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/giorgio/giorgio|Giorgio]],
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-corvinus-versailles/|Corvinus Versailles]],
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/pall-mall-rr/|RR Pall Mall]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/niagara/|Niagara]]...
    Transition between top and down parts is no good either, curvy for Spire, straight
    for the sample... As suggested by riccard0, I also think it has been manually
    slanted.
