body: I am to be doing my first real &#40;like, paid even&#41; design job. My client
  is wanting business cards, a letterhead and some other pre-press work done. I believe
  the business is multimedia. <BR> <BR>For his business card, he is wanting me to
  use Arial, because it is clean and simple etc. I think the reason for this is he
  either doesn&#39;t realise there are other typefaces available to purchase, &#40;which
  could lend the design a distinctive quality and hint of character&#41; or does not
  want to invest. <BR> <BR>I am scheduled to work initially for 4 hours, by the way.
  &#40;this could be a squeeze &#62;_&#60; &#41; <BR> <BR>So, I am looking to some
  free alternatives to Arial in the mean-time.  I would even rather use Helvetica.
  &#40;it&#39;s just more well crafted&#41;. I also don&#39;t think he would want
  to go to the extra trouble of purchasing a font considering the duration of my employment.
  <BR> <BR>Alternatives anyone? Thanks <BR> <BR>- Chris

  body: Chris, did you do a Google Search? Also take a trip to DaFont and hunt through
    their Sans list.

  body: Hah, I actually have a little trouble discerning free from comes-with-the-computer
    sometimes. I thought Gill Sans was a font you had to buy, but I have it somehow.
    Who knows? Probably part of a freeware office-type program. hmm. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re
    right Daniel.  I did do a google search, but I got discouraged by the number of
    results. Perhaps I should have just asked for a few comprehensive free font sites.
    I am quite weary of wading through million hit searches for pages with thousands
    of possible searchs designed to just get a hit. <BR> <BR>Sorry, I ramble. <BR>
    <BR>Many thanks Daniel. I lost the bit of paper my typography tutor gave me with
    all the free type sites. <BR> <BR>- Chris

  body: Ohh, Mank Sans is quite good. I like Communist from Dafont, looks quite...
    like a bought one. They have a few bitstream fonts floating around there. I also
    found bitsream Vera lying around the net... has this been surrendered to the masses?
    I suppose some foundries do free fonts. <BR> <BR>- Chris
