  body: This looks like Greco Bold, from samples in the Solotype Catalog and Jaspert&#39;s
    &#39;Encyclopaedia of Type Faces&#39;. I am not sure if I can find an online sample,
    but I think that&#39;s your type here.

  body: BTW, the <a href="http://www.fontfinder.ws/search.html?search=Greco" target="_blank">Agfa-Monotype
    version</a> is not quite the same, and is all-caps. For some reason their own
    sample is not available for viewing right now. I will try to scan the Jaspert
    sample to show you.

  body: Here&#39;s a scan from the Jaspert book of Greco &#40;or Bristol&#41; from
    a Gans 1925 typeface. You can see the A and C are like the sample, and the lower
    case matches as well, in as many common characters as are shown. Unfortunately
    this sample doesn&#39;t show the entire character set, but I think it shows enough
    to make the case. Note that the stroke  of the right leg of the A is simpler than
    the Agfa-Monotype &#39;Greco&#39; from the link I gave previously. Apparently
    the newer Monotype/Linotype versions exaggerated that feature, or else developed
    a solid version of the Adornado face that is not the same as Greco Bold. &#40;The
    Linotype version was called Vulcan, but looks almost identical.&#41; <BR><img

  body: It is Greco Bold, but the e&#39;s have been tilted slightly. I know this for
    a fact because I have worked with the original artwork files for the logo and
    happen to know the designer who did it. The artwork, incidentally, was created
    by scanning from a type specimen book, not with an electronic version of the font.

  body: Mark, thanks for the confirmation. Do you know if the original face was ever
    digitized? The FontHaus versions that Agfa sells are just versions of the Adornado
    design, and are all-caps.

  body: I think FontHaus has &#40;or had&#41; all of them, but they were not very
    well done. I don&#39;t know of any others. There was also at one time a Linotype
    face called Vulcan which was probably a knock-off of Greco. It looks more or less
    the same, but with differences in detail. It&#39;s different enough, though, that
    it would not match the PHC logo.
