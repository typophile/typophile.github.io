body: I have an old  non-latin postscript type 3 font for which there is no type 1
  or TT versions. In OS X this font is recognized by Carbon applications like MS Office
  but is not recognized by Cocoa applications i.e. TextEdit. Is there a way to have
  Cocoa applications recognize PS type 3 fonts? <BR> <BR>I tried converting it to
  a PS type 1 font, but being non-latin, the results are unacceptable.  <BR> <BR>Will
  Acrobat 5 or 6 allow me to embed a type 3 font in a pdf file, so I can re-print
  it in the future? <BR> <BR>Will appreciate any assisstance. TIA.

  body: Type 3 will have the same encoding issues as Type 1; whatever differences
    you are seeing should be fixable. <BR> <BR>WHen you say it&#39;s &#34;non-latin,&#34;
    what exactly is it? It might make more sense to turn it into TrueType or OpenType.
    <BR> <BR>You can embed Type 3 in PDF, but what will that accomplish? Is this some
    document you will never want to change? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T
