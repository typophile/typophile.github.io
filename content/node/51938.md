  body: This looks very interesting. Do you feel your book is a companion to Bringhurst
    or is there more overlap than that?

  body: "Thanks guys. I'm looking forward to see what the community thinks. I'm sure
    some well deserved dismantling will occur.\r\n\r\nMay I dare say a companion to
    Bringhurst? Mentioning my book in the same sentence as Bringhurst's is humbling.\r\n\r\nBut
    yes, it's intended as a companion more of less. It's structured for quick reference
    about the facts but doesn't cover style like Bringhurst.\r\n\r\nTheo\r\nhttp://rosendorf.us"

    those in the book.\r\n\r\n\"At\" invokes the visualization of a map's location
    in a way \"in\" can't.\r\n\r\nBut depending on which style book you're holding...\r\n\r\nIt's
    being edited as we speak, so there's a slight chance this could bubble up there.
    Hope it doesn't though."

  body: "This is a beautiful book & a welcome addition to the typo reference sector.
    What I would like to see is a sister edition set in a readable blackletter such
    as Final Fraktur. Typographers like Dan Reynolds and myself do what we can to
    promote a revival of blackletters as an alternative to the dictatorship of the
    Western roman alphabet.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
