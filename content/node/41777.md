body: Doing a new identity for a gourmet food company. I'm probably going to go w/
  a Michael Schwab look/feel. Small caps, letterpaced. I'm testing fonts like Georgia,
  Hoefler Text, and Clarendon Light. Any other suggestions?

  body: What kind of research have you done. How are you handling the ID. Is it a
    retail store, is it packaging, what is the competition doing and are they successful.
    I wouldn't worry about the type until you have the marketing figured out,

  body: Before picking a face, I'd find a few brands you like, and get your client's
    feedback on those; also, I'd work them to draw out rough sketches.   I find that
    if I fall in love with a typeface too early in the process, I become less focused
    on my client's needs.  Good luck!
