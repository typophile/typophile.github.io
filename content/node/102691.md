    printed text body. The work is for a printed book, and the cover is designed in
    this font. But it isn't very readable, I think. Maybe I could pair it with Quadraat.
    Do you think so?\r\n\r\nM."

    if you\u2019re concerned with matching Didot, you need something classic with
    a bit of \uFB01nesse.\r\nAnd it should have a vertical axis.\r\nI would recommend
    Storm\u2019s Baskerville.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/baskerville-original-pro/\r\n\r\nAlternatively,

  body: "Thank you!! Well, I have tried two options before:\r\n\r\n\xB7 HTF Didot
    for cover, chapter titles, headers and page numbers, and Bembo for body text.
    Not sure about it. I suppose Adobe's Kepler is in this line.\r\n\xB7 Other option
    I tried was HTF Didot for cover, and FF Quadraat for text inside \u2014Chapter
    titles, headers, page numbers, etc\u2014.Of course I works, but not sure if there
    is a hard difference between cover an interiors.\r\n\r\nI am going to try Adobe
    Kepler, Storm's Baskerville and Starling. Thanks!\r\n\r\nMarcel"

    or Didot-based fonts that have been redrawn to print well at text size with current
    technology. Maybe Kepler will, haven't used it yet. \r\n\r\nBTW, If you get Miller,
    harass (either Carter & Cone or Font Bureau) to include the old-style numbers.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Not what you asked, but most book designers start by selecting the text font,
    then finding a display that works with it. This on the assumption that unlike
    advertising, it is the text that is more important..."

  body: "I too have always had difficulties setting body copy in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didot_(typeface)\">Didone</a>.
    Bit of an aside, from day one of my typographic education (c 1992) we were instructed
    to <strong>never</strong> use two serifs on a page, save for contexts when one
    was used for display purposes with extreme differences in size &c compared to
    to the body copy. I believe this context qualifies as such. \r\n\r\nIn those days,
    the traditional pair was Futura. I am personally quite fond of <a href=\"http://berthold.forest.net/bq_library/090200000.html\">Berthold
    Futura Serie</a> as it has small caps and old-style figures. It\u2019s pricey,
    but worth it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could give Futura shot just to see what it looks
    like?"

  body: "I guess if the differences in size are big enough, this should be no problem,
    and Didot and Bodoni are very close, also historically. But yes, a match with
    a sans might work as well, though I am not sure Futura would work. It is very
    diffecult to set copy in futura, possible even more than a didone. If you get
    it right, it looks great, just have a look at one of the books Renner set in Futura
    medium. But the printing and technology has changed, and I don\u2019t know if
    futura would look great in offset... Perhaps another geometric sans would work
    though. Avenir is obviously a candidate, some others have slipped my mind right
    now..."

  body: "I think you can use two serifs on a page if there is a big enough size difference.
    Like a 30+ point Didot chapter number (as a figure, maybe screened back, whatever)
    paired with any agreeable serif font for the text.\r\n\r\nUnless I'm designing
    a text for the sciences, I rarely set the subheads in a font different from the
    text face anymore.  Even with the chapter titles, I'll tend to stick to the same
    typeface, though truth to tell, I (try to) use spacing arrangements to frame the
    page, not type size or boldface.\r\n\r\nThere is always a temptation to set the
    running heads in a different font, to avoid any confusion with a subhead falling
    at the head of a page, but there are other solutions for that too, and I usually
    employ them. \r\n\r\nA lot of well-designed books are set using one type family
    only, with any bold coming in only when an author employs it as a textual device.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "Well, the fact is that I have to use a serif because is a book on philosophy,
    so a Berthold Futura Serie for the body could look strange. \r\n\r\nAs you say
    the serif has to be really different, and the strategy of the size is there. The
    problem when you use running heads is that there is the tempation of using a different
    font, and is very difficult to avoid that.\r\n\r\nIn my case I have to use an
    HTF Didot in the covers, but inside I can use whatever I want. My idea was to
    use the Didot HTF for running heads and page numbers and another serif for body,
    but as you say, if the HTF Didot font is not much bigger than the body font, maybe
    will look strange, whatever the serif font used in the body.\r\n\r\nMaybe the
    solution could be a transition in the title page and the index with the HTF Didot
    and only one serif in the rest of the book: running heads, body and page numbers.
    All of you said fonts like Kepler, Storm's Baskerville, Caledonia, Georgia and
    ITC Bodoni. I'll give it a try\u2026 \r\n\r\nTo pair a Didot with a body font
    is a difficult challenge\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcelG."

    he uses it this way, he always uses the Didot large in the interior -- again,
    as I said, for a chapter number, part number, something \"insignificant\" textually,
    but visually there. Always large, 72 points or larger. Usually screened back.\r\n\r\nEven
    for design teachers who insist on a linkage between jacket and interior, that's
    usually enough."

  body: "\"only one serif in the rest of the book: running heads, body and page numbers\".
    (and index too, may I add)\r\n\r\nThat is the way. I don't see any necessity to
    feature the cover font inside the book; except, if you wish, in the title-page,
    where you could set the title in the same font used in the cover. Everything else
    should be set in one typeface only.\r\n\r\nAs for the fonts mentioned:\r\n- (New)
    Caledonia doesn't seem to be a great digital revival;\r\n- Kepler is great but
    probably a hard beast to tame;\r\n- Storm's Baskerville is nice if you want a
    \"retro\" look;\r\n- ITC Bodoni could work well if you don't mind having a book
    set in Bodoni (not the best choice for extended reading, in my opinion);\r\n-
    Georgia - go with Miller instead (the former was designed for screen reading).\r\n\r\nThat
    said, any well done serifs, planned for text settings, and with the appropriate
    features (old style figures, small caps, superiors) will work for your book. In
    Europe there's a long XX century tradition of Academic and Humanistic literature
    (and Philosophy books) set in Garamonds / Renaissance typefaces - you could have
    a look at some stuff in that lineage."
