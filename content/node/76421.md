body: "Hello. Not sure this is the perfect place to post this, but know I can probably
  get some opinions here. To make a really long re-brand effort story short, I'll
  just say that I'm working on an ID for a small design firm and the direction from
  the client has been given to try something hand-written. With the client being a
  creative agency, I want to push it in a direction that isn't too clean or proper.
  I visualize the mark being used large on things....may be always running off the
  edge or something. I wanted some opinions on the options I posted below. I applied
  them to a business card to give some context. These are not the \"real\" business
  cards. So...any opinions would be appreciated! Which options you like/hate/think
  they're all crap...whatever. These were made with india ink + brush.\r\n[[http://bradwofford.com/clients/script/B-card-mock-script01.jpg|option-1]]\r\n[[http://bradwofford.com/clients/script/B-card-mock-script02.jpg|option-2]]\r\n[[http://bradwofford.com/clients/script/B-card-mock-script03.jpg|option-3]]\r\n[[http://bradwofford.com/clients/script/B-card-mock-script05.jpg|option-5]]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    it immediately occurred to me that the text could be placed more diagonally on
    the card."
