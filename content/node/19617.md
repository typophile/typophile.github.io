  are some other file formats into which fonts can be embedded?

  body: 'We should have a wiki article on the various caveats associated with embedding
    fonts in these formats. As I recall there are limitations with some of them, particularly
    the MS formats. Some questions are: Full Font or Subset? Can the document be edited?
    Is there a mechanism for determining if a font is missing? Are substitutions automatic?'
