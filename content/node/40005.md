    encounter problems such as these.  Try to include the offending font.  I notified
    the responsible engineers and they are now investigating.

  body: "Failing the \"'FOND' font association usability\" test probably means that
    the font has no outlines but only bitmaps. There are some known problems with
    such fonts on Leopard which we hope to address in a future release. In general,
    however, bitmap-only fonts don't work in all situations in Mac OS X and it would
    be best to switch to a TrueType, PostScript, or OpenType version of the font.
    \r\n\r\nAs Dan says, if you suspect there is a problem with the font validation
    engine used by Font Book or with font activation, please file a bug or send Apple
    feedback and include the font. Even if we know which validation test is involved,
    it's hard for us to track down any problems without having a copy of the font
    itself which triggers it. The following URLs are the places to start:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/bugrptform.html\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/faq/bugreporting.html\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/bugreporter\r\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: "tseng,\r\n\r\nI have 2 quick questions related to your response to this issue,
    as you posted it on one of the boards in Florian's links above. To whit--\r\n\r\nI
    fetched Rezilla as you recommended, was able to open an offensive Type 1 bitmap
    suitcase, and delete superfluous bitmaps. No problem. Now, my two quick questions:\r\n\r\n1.
    How do I save these changes to a new file that Mac OS recognizes as a bitmap suitcase?
    The Rezilla documentation is weak, so I couldn't figure it out. I did a \"Save
    As\" and it wants to save the edited suitcase as a .rsrc file. I did, changed
    the extension to .bmap, but no dice--the OS still does not see it as a suitcase.\r\n\r\n2.
    In the suitcase, when it is opened, there are also a number of NFNT resources.
    Only ID numbers are provided (no names). I don't know what these numbers represent,
    I only recall from the old days that NFNT has something to do with fonts (blushes...)
    Do I need to do anything with these as well, and if so, how?\r\n\r\nThanks for
    your help..........(and yes, we need the system to let us open bitmap suitcases
    again a-la earlier versions of the OS. Or have Apple write a little utility app
    that does the same thing, a-la the old Font DA Mover.)\r\n\r\n"

    Arabic shaping in CoreText and general feature handling but, there are no immediate
    plans to add specific shaping engines (we realize of course they will certainly
    need to be eventually written).  Which scripts & languages were you most interested
    in seeing added?\r\n\r\nDan"

  body: "Ryan:\r\n\r\n1.  The file won't be recognized as a suitcase unless it has
    the right file type.  Check Rezilla to see if it will let you set the file type
    to FFIL.  Otherwise, you'll need to install the developer tools and use:\r\n\r\nSetFile
    -t FFIL <whatever your suitcase name is>\r\n\r\nYou may want to give it the extension
    \".suit\", but that shouldn't be necessary.  \r\n\r\n2.  Don't worry about the
    extra NFNTs.  They're harmless, and it's too much trouble to track down the ones
    you don't need.  They're the places where the bitmaps actually live.  \r\n\r\n"
