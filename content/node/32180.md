  revision of the original FF Info Text Family. Regular and Caps now work better with
  the new Italic weights and they all now have standard Adobe encoding and integrated
  Euro symbols. Some letterforms have been corrected and the widths and kerning have
  been re-tooled. In addition, there are now two sets of figures (old style and table
  figures) and Expert Sets with arrows, mathematical symbols, and fractions. Notice:
  type set in FF Info Text (Update) will flow differently than the same text set in
  the old FF Info Text.\r\n\r\nFF Info Text Italic and Caps Italic are brand new designs
  by Ole Sch\xE4fer as extensions to the Text family.\r\n\r\n<strong>About FF Info
  Office</strong>\r\n\r\nSince every PC owner can now print out his or her correspondence
  with Times New Roman or Helvetica/Arial, real typefaces are no longer a novelty.
  At the same time, no-one would like to go back to the old typewriter characters:
  They don't have different weights, but need a lot of space. Equal widths for all
  characters meant that an m had to cramp into the same space as a narrow i. Esthetically
  that has never been satisfying, but still exists in everybodys imagination as the
  epitome of office communication. FF Info Office\u2122 combines the advantages of
  a typesetting face with the merits of a typewriter face. The character widths show
  less variations than the typesetting version FF Info Text\u2122. The letter forms
  are designed to withstand printing on simple printers and to be legible on screen.
  Three weights plus italics as well as various figures in circles or squares give
  scope for adventurous layouts of letters and faxes. The expert sets contain figures
  with kerned widths rather than lining figures in the normal weights. The crossed
  out Zero in the expert sets distinguishes itself from the capital O. European special
  characters, real fractions, Greek characters, the Euro sign and several symbols
  in circles complete these sets. Naturally, the FF Info Office goes best with the
  other two typefaces of the Info family, FF Info Display and FF Info Text. The robustness
  and affinity to a typewriter face, however, make it a good companion to any other
  typesetting face when preprinted text and correspondence copy are to be distinguishable
  frome each other. \r\n\r\n<strong>About FF Info Display</strong>\r\n\r\nA complete
  revision of the original FF Info Family. Made to work better in combination with
  the new italic weights, the new FF Info Display also has standard Adobe encoding
  and integrated Euro symbols. Some letterforms have been corrected and the widths
  and kerning have been re-tooled. In addition, there are now two sets of figures
  (old style and table figures) and Expert Sets with arrows, mathematical symbols,
  and fractions. Notice: type set in FF Info Display (Update) will flow differently
  than the same text set in the old FF Info Display. FF Info Display Italic is a brand
  new design by Ole Sch\xE4fer as an extension to the Display family.\r\n\r\n<strong>External
