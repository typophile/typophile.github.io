  body: "While wood and metal type are still used for letterpress, 3D plates can be
    created digitally (you create a film negative and use it to expose a heat-sensitive
    polymer plate)--which means that as long as the type isn't too small or too thin,
    it can be letterpressed.\r\n\r\nHard to be sure with the perspective of the original,
    but Alternate Gothic seems a likely candidate (for both lines of type):\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/alternate_gothic/"

      of the typeface, if that helps. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo-5_5657.jpg]

    from the new sample that the terminals on the S end parallel to the baseline (Alternate
    Gothic's are slightly angled):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsnerflake/alternate_gothic_no_one_ot/\r\n\r\nKeep
