<p>I was referring to keeping the type in good shape for the long haul. You are right; if one tries to print immdiately after washing the type with kerosene or coal oil, the ink won&rsquo;t transfer from the roller to the type.</p>
<p>If the type has been stored for some time the residue will have evaporated; there will be no trace of it and and type will ink again.</p>
<p>Leaving the oily solvent on the type does prevent it from developing &ldquo;type rust&rdquo; (oxides) even after long periods.</p>

<p>Lead can&rsquo;t rust, so I don&rsquo;t know what the coloration is in your pic. But it does look like you do have some oxidation going on there as well. This is bad. Lead oxide. White lead. This is what causes lead poisoning. Also a great ingrediant in ink—rich long lasting blacks (Gutenberg, and apparently he alone, used it). This corrosion is usually caused by a reaction of some sort combining humidity and acid. Dampness in the case (reaction with the wood lignum), salt water, urine (yes), cigarette ash (oddly enough, it eats holes in the lead), and probably others.</p>
<p>You want to get rid of this. I don&rsquo;t know how effective lye is against this so much as it was used to clean ink from type in the old days. I usually recommend scrapping the type out as it is at this point hazardess.</p>
<p>The type lice referral in the earlier post is actually the lye itself not the oxide. Long story (and printer&rsquo;s tale) but printer&rsquo;s devils (young boys) responsible for cleaning the type would sprinkle the lye into the case (as a prank). When the compositors would set the type the lye would cause them to sneeze.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I came across this thread when searching for a way to clean old metal type. This has really been the only useful source of info I&rsquo;ve found so far. Oddly, I just listened to Tiffany Wardle&rsquo;s interview with TypeRadio last night and she said her favourite word was &ldquo;serendipity&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s quite serendipitous that the answer to my question was to be found on Typophile the very next day when I planned to sign-up. Hmm&hellip;anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a small box of metal type my friend salvaged from the print shop his family used to run. It&rsquo;s filthy and I&rsquo;d like to clean it so I can display it somehow but I don&rsquo;t know how and I&rsquo;m not exactly liking the idea of getting some lye to clean it with. The two previous posts said beeswax can be used to clean metal type but how exactly is that done?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That &ldquo;oxide&rdquo; actually looks like rust, but lead does not rust. Perhaps the colouration was transferred from very wet metal galley.</p>
<p>By the way, lye is not as readily available as one might think. It was until recently. Ask a local soapmaker, they have difficulty getting lye. The stuff sold in hardware stores usually are &ldquo;now&rdquo; substitute chemicals.</p>
<p>Lead oxide should be viewed as electrolysis. This happens when metals of different nobilities are in direct contact. This activity can readily happen between type metal and metal gallies.</p>
<p>Zinc is so low in nobility it is used as sacrificial metal to preserve the fastenings and propellers on boats. This is why metal galley cabinets should have zinc between the cabinet and the floor and inspected annually. If it turns white, which it will, replace it.</p>
<p>That said I never suffered from lead oxide deterioration.</p>
