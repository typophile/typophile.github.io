  body: I think it's a matter of personal taste, but I would generally go with the
    topmost, except to keep the normal Z.

  body: For the /K/, I'd try something based on the I< (look at Meta for example),
    style construction to minimize the dark spot (if that makes sense).

  body: "I wonder if the median horizontal bar of /K/ and /X/ crossing should more
    closely match /B/E/F/ (I assume you chose the upper variant, excepted /Z/).\r\nI
    don't know if it's too tall, but certainly I see /f/ and /t/ suffering. \r\n/i/
    and /j/ shouldn't have same x-height?\r\nan finally, I'm not into /x/ form.\r\nBut
    in general I truly like the font face :) let's see figures!\r\n"
