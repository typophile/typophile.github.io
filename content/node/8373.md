body: Hi, <BR> <BR>This is a question to any earlier users of FLab&#39;s ScanFont.
  A fair few months ago I tried a free version of ScanFont 3 for Mac. I bought the
  full version of v4 a few days ago, but I am beginning to wonder if my memory is
  playing tricks on me. <BR> <BR>Did earlier versions of ScanFont allow you to name
  a glyph quicky within ScanFont itself by selecting its seperated out cell and entering
  it&#39;s name into a field in a floating properties style window? Or is my memory
  playing tricks on me? <BR> <BR>If it did, then can it still do so or has that feature
  been dropped? <BR> <BR>Hope someone can help <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> &#40;Why don&#39;t I just re-install the earlier ScanFont?
  One snapped powerbook and one failed email backup!&#41;

  body: David, <BR> <BR>You are right. This feature has been removed in SF4. <BR>ScanFont
    will automatically assign Unicode indexes and names on export and you will be
    able to correct them in TypeTool or FontLab later. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Johnych
