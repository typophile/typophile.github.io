  was born in Canada, raised in Florida and educated in Minnesota. He currently runs
  his foundry [[Chank Fonts]] from his home office in Minneapolis, MN, USA. \r\n\r\nChank
  strives to make fonts fun and accessible for both the average computer-user and
  professional designers. He distributes a diverse collection of display fonts through
  his website [[http://www.chank.com|Chank.com]] and also creates custom fonts for
  corporate clients who want exclusive rights and a specific design for a typeface.
  Chank's [[http://www.chank.com/gofontyourself/index.php|Go Font Yourself!]] service
  is popular with individuals who want a custom font of their own handwriting.\r\n\r\nChank
  began making fonts in 1992 when he worked as creative director of the alternative
  music magazine, <em>CAKE</em>. Making the most of his connections in the music industry,
  he road-tripped across America and visited designers at record labels. He earned
  a reputation as \"The Travelling Font Salesman\" and also snagged some high profile
  font appearances on album covers.\r\n\r\nChank's fonts were featured in the Smithsonian's
  Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum as \"important examples of contemporary typography\"
  in 1996, the same year as he established Chank.com. In 1997 he was profiled in <em>The
  Wall Street Journal</em>, complete with etched portrait. More recently he was featured
  in the <em>New York Times</em> article entitled \"[[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/technology/personaltech/26basics.html?8dpc|Down
  With Helvetica: Design Your Own Font]].\"\r\n\r\nHe is also a [[http://www.mnartists.org/article.do?rid=217589|painter]].\r\n\r\nWebsite:
