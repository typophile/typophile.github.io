body: "Looking for suggestions for a complimentary serif for Omnes. Using Omnes semibold
  for titles, and looking for a warmer, but reasonably serious serif to accompany
  it. The book is largely picture heavy, with small blocks of text roughly 3 paras
  long. It's for a research centre that wants to present their technology in a more
  \"human\", 'friendly\" way.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated!"
