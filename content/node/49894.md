  but would also be interested if the \"New\" is any known script font, though I assume
  that's probably hand-lettered. The swash \"S\" is obviously hand-modified, of course.

  body: "I have my doubts that HAMPSHIRE is a font (I definitely think New is hand-drawn).
    To me this looks like some of the work of Chuck Davis and other guys at Letterhead
    Fonts, which means is could be almost any commercial sign artist's work. The only
    duplicated letter in the word is the H and the proportions of both are not the
    same. Sure, it could be graphic 'squooshing', but I think this may be custom lettering,
    and not a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thank you for the input. I also had had the thought it was reminiscent of
    LHF designs but didn't see it there, so you are probably right it's custom lettering.
