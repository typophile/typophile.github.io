  writing systems. \r\n\r\nI would like to start with the Latin writing system.\r\n1.
  Origin of the Serif\r\n2. Different shapes of Serifs\r\n3. It's role in readability/legibility\r\n4.
  It's role as a decorative element\r\n\r\nThen it was my plan to apply that scheme
  to other writing systems, such as Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew, Arabic, Devenagari,
  Cyrillic, Greek...(These are the possible candidates. I won't discuss them all.
  )\r\n\r\nI would work as following:\r\nIs there a serif/equivalent to a serif?\r\nDoes
  it have a name? What's its origin?\r\nDoes it improve readability/legibility?\r\nOr
  does it merely exist for esthetical reasons?\r\n\r\nI have some questions I would
  like to ask you:\r\n1. Is this a good idea all together? Should I just stick with
  Latin?\r\n2. Do you know any good books on any of these writing systems?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This sounds very interesting.\r\n\r\nYou should also discuss and compare
    the notion of readability as it has changed over time, such as from print to screen.
    While serif designs are generally considered to be the most readable in print,
    when it comes to mobile devices, sans serif is generally better, perhaps due to
    the more uniform stem widths. In fact, some sans serif designs actually have small
    serif-like thingies at the terminals, or the stroke terminals are flared. The
    serifs and flares are actually detrimental when it comes to mobile device use.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I cover CJK writing systems in [[http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596514471/|<em>CJKV

    of readability per se.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior Computer Scientist, CJKV

  body: "To me the most interesting angle in this topic is the role of serifs in the
    relationships in multi-script systems. Let me give an example from my own experience.
    When making a text face with Latin and Armenian components, the Latin (Roman)
    can be upright and can possess the conventional serif scheme without problems*,
    but if one follows the (flawed) tradition of making the Armenian based very closely
    on the Latin one ends up with upright forms and... too many serifs! Because the
    Armenian \"x-height\" is choc full of vertical stems. One alternative is to give
    the Armenian a slanted semi-serif form; one reason this works well is Armenian
    needs Italics far less than Latin (since it has a floating emphasis mark that
    can be placed on any vowel). Now, if one makes the Armenian upright, semi-serifs
    cause the letteforms to appear slightly backslanted**. I have an article about
    all this entitled \"Latinization: Prevention and Cure\" in back issues of both
    Spatium and Hyphen - it might be useful to read it.\r\n\r\n* Not that there's
    no room for massive innovation in this area!\r\n\r\n** Although Bloemsma showed
    an interesting solution to this in his Avance.\r\n\r\nHere's one view of the type
    system in question:\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/ad/CR.pdf\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to get a hold of Huda Smitshuijzen Abifares' book\r\n\r\n@Ken Lunde: I will discuss
    readability in relation to different types of media/circumstances. E.g.: Low resolution
    screens and highway signs demand a simpler letterform; a sans...\r\n\r\n@Hrant:
    thanks for the very interesting examples. I love the solution of a slightly slanted,
    semi-serif roman as a companion to the armenian font. Very nice to see the latin
    being moddeled after the Armenian, instead of the (usual) other way around.\r\n\r\nThe
    role of serifs in relation to multi-script systems is indeed the interessanting
    angle. Unfortunatly I don't speak/read any language in a non-Latin script. So
    I won't be able to do extensive research and I will have to rely on other people
    since I can't tell wether a certain script has been latinized and if the result
    looks odd\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\nWouter"
