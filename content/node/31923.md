  font with Fontlab. I've a big problem: kerning doesn't work. Kerning feature is
  correctly compiled, and if i open the new generated font with fontlab, kerning is
  ok. But if i use the font on any application (photoshop, illustrator...) kerning
  doesn't work..."

    and/or rebuilding the kerning tables helps, but that's ofcourse not a solution.\r\n\r\nI
    would like to know a solution as well. :)"

    in your font.\r\n\r\nThis comes up about once a week. I think we need a wiki entry
    until Adobe fixes the bug in future releases.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the GPOS tables (kerning)
    will not work in many Adobe applications unless there is also a GSUB (ligaturing,
    fractions, etc.) table as well.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Ah ok. But it's not consistent. Because sometimes the kerning works, sometimes
    it does not.

    which it doesn't, and which are \"occasional.\"\r\n\r\nBut I can't go any farther,
    since the only applications I have a passing understanding of are FontLab and
    InDesign. "
