  body: Hi Mike, thanks for the comments. I don't think it's either Avenir or Neutraface...the
    K is off and S are off.

  body: This is interesting. To me, it looks like they are borrowing letters from
    Avant Garde demi and Gotham medium, but some widths seems a bit off. I bet there
    is a bit of stretching of letters. The C in 5 looks like Gotham while in 6 looks
    like Avant Garde.
