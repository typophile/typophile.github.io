  hand rendered, but obviously digitized. If anyone has information for the slab serif
  &#40;slip the drummer one&#41; or the dotted one &#40;see next message&#41; Please
  responsd. Thank you! <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"

  body: ' The slab serif is something I&#39;ve seen digitized before, but I can&#39;t
    recall exactly where. I&#39;m thinking that ScanJam has done this &#40;the original
    design is late 1800s Victorian, I&#39;m pretty sure&#41;, but since their site
    is down now, I can&#39;t confirm.  <BR> <BR>If Joshua Darden is monitoring this
    board, he&#39;ll be able to tell you.  <BR> <BR>The other possibility is that
    these were all just scanned out of the Dover type series. <BR> <BR>-- K. '

  body: I did a face based on these sorts of weight relationships, called Cassandra.

    <BR> <BR>I took more than a few liberties with this face, but line four of this
    GIF is more or less a faithful reproduction of a 19th century face whose name
    and provenance escape me. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s safe to call the Cornershop
    type more &#39;Italian&#39; than &#39;French Clarendon,&#39; due to the lack of
    bracketing and the turned-in serifs of the S. <BR> <BR>j.

    font in that style, wouldn&#39;t it serve nicely to set some &#34;subordinate&#34;
    text to Arabic, Hebrew, or other scripts that have horizontal stress? Excoffon

    Italian, a Fat Face that&#39;s been algorithmically turned inside-out. The second
