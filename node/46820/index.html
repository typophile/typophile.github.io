  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a young french student and I&rsquo;m spending a month in New York City&hellip; Although I&rsquo;ve already done a bit of research, I don&rsquo;t know where to find good bookshops (new or second-hand books) specialized in type or graphic design. 
Also, I have to research on Morris Fuller Benton, so I thought I might find some material here in college or public libraries, but I have no clue of where to look for that.</p>
<p>So, if any New Yorker could help me with this, I&rsquo;d be very grateful!</p>
<p>If you can think of any event related to type/graphic design coming this month, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to bring it up &hellip;</p>

There’s also a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taschen store<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a nice selection of design titles can be found at the MoMA bookstore. The various school libraries may have weird summer hours, so call ahead for those.</p>
<p>Otherwise the New York bookstores aren’t very special, they’re just bigger and more expensive versions of the bookstores found everywhere else. New Yorkers rave to me about the gigantic Strand Books (which isn’t much bigger than a large suburban Barnes and Noble), but it’s really just a huge clearing house for remainders and discounted bombs dressed up with some stacks of discounted new stuff, and the rare books room is mix of junk and esoterica, almost none of which is of use to typographers. Don’t waste time there if you have serious research to get done. If you’re looking for special antique stuff I have the address of a by-appointment only place that does type books around here somewhere.</p>

<p>Meanwhile - how is Alabaster Bookshop for used &amp; rare books these days? Also, one of my old favorites, I forgot the name was on 59th Street off of Lexington &ndash; are they even still there? They had a wonderful collection of rare maps as well?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I’m reversing my opinion on Strand Book’s design selection; is has improved dramatically. They’ve been working hard since January to clear out the crap by discounting it, including their backstock of old annuals. That space has been filled with an excellent selection of new and used books. The table of design books on the sales floor is no longer for bargain stuff, it’s now primarily new books (priced well below MSRP) with some interesting used books mixed in. Interestingly, the selection at Strand and the giant Barnes and Noble design section on the other end of Union Square don’t overlap much, making Union Square an art and design book nerd’s dream.</p>
<p>Strand has also just finished a reorganization of the books-on-books nook on the third floor. The piles of books are no longer on the floor, everything is grouped intelligibly, duplicates are shelved together, and so on. The prices are also much more reasonable than they were in the past—I’ve picked things up there for half or even a third what other collectors paid there, and it is similarly less expensive than buying online. The selection of other rare books seems better overall. I’m not sure if this is because people aren’t able to snap good stuff up, if desperate collectors are selling books to get by, or if they’ve finally got around to shelving a lot of backstock, but it’s a real pleasure to walk through these days.</p>
