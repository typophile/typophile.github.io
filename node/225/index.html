<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I am finally making the leap to OS X. I am upgrading just about <br>every thing Adobe including a new purchase of ID. Exciting. <br> <br>As for font management I have always used Suitcase from the <br>beginning and have little hands on with Font Reserve. <br> <br>Currently, I am up to Suitcase 10 which is built for OS X but if <br>something works better I would like to know. <br> <br>What would you recommend for a font management program <br>and why? What is best for X?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Font Reserve is horrendous in OSX. As a carbon app it is <br>suffering from some major interface glitches (can't even <br>scroll proper!). <br> <br>I've never tried Suitcase, but I heard bad things. <br> <br>So I tried FontAgent. It is decent, the closest experience to <br>good ol' ATM Deluxe of the three. Only major problem: it is <br>slow as cold tar when adding new fonts.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>After some mixed experiences with FontReserve on OS X, <br>I've been doing without any sort of add-on font utility for <br>the last six months. <br> <br>Basically, what I do is keep all of my fonts in a large <br>organized collection, with each family in its own folder. <br>When I want to use a font, I just drag-copy its folder into <br>my user Fonts folder. (In OS X, you can keep fonts in <br>folders within the Fonts folder.) Most apps will update their <br>font menus automatically. For those that don't, just quit <br>the app and start it up again. When I'm done using a font, I <br>just put it in the Trash (I still have the original with the rest <br>of my collection). <br> <br>If you rely on auto-activation or use Classic a lot, this may <br>not be for you, but it has a kind of elegant simplicity that <br>appeals to me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>MacHome seems ignorant of the cocoa/carbon issue. Apps <br>built from the ground up for OSX (cocoa) are generally <br>smoother and behave more as you would expect. iTunes is <br>probably the only carbon app that I've not seen exhibit <br>significant UI foibles. <br> <br>I haven't tried Suitcase, which is carbon, but the difference <br>between the FontAgent and Font Reserve experience is clear.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I saw a demo of FontReserve at MacWorld. At the demo, FR <br>looked pretty sweet, with options to search for fonts in <br>your library by classication, designer, period, etc. On a few <br>occasions I've wished Suitcase could do this. ("Show me all <br>the scripts," for example.) <br> <br>However, Suitcase has been just fine for me. Stable and <br>everything. But if you're using any Classic apps still, expect <br>some weirdness with font management across the two OSs.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm one of those strange people that actually owns Suitcase, Font Agent and Font Reserve. I'm also strange enough to admit that I loaded and unloaded each of them at least twice while getting used to OS X. Font Agent was s-l-o-w! And from what I recall I had to leave to open. (Someone correct me here) I still think Font Reserve, even with the scrolling weirdness, is stronger than the others. I also really appreciate that they can control the system fonts and, AND, their tech support is quick and friendly.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Font Reserve? Ok: <br>1. Can't scroll font list with thumb bar <br>2. Can't scroll font list with mouse scroll wheel <br>3. Crash-o-rama. <br> <br>Clearly, in the end, there still isn't a solid font management <br>solution for X, (not like ATM Deluxe was anyway), but <br>FontAgent is closest for me, even if slow.

<div class=commentbody>yes - suitcase has autoactivation in x, no problems in indesign or freehand (the only apps i really use much of). i love it - have converted - was waiting with bated breath for atm deluxe for a year but have given up on that. we bought a multi-user license here at work and everyone seems very happy with it. no problem handling PC fonts, opentype, TT, postscript in OSX - sometimes it renders the sample window incorrectly but everything seems to work fine otherwise.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've been an advocate of FontReserve since the early days. But, the program is buggier in X, and is showing signs of age with respect to its interface. I might give FontAgent a whirl. Seems like it has what I liked in FR, but in a better package. On a semi-related note, I've always wondered why something like font management, which seems fairly close to the OS level, shouldn't be included with the OS. I appreciate competition with regard to software, but part of me thinks Apple could do a dandy job if it would include some sort of font management utility built into the OS. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I've just disabled FontReserve, and downloaded and installed a Trial version of FontAgent Pro. It's pretty slick, but there are a couple of drawbacks I see so far. First, it's slows up launching and shutting down, since it has to do some database management thing that FontReserve never did. Second, libraries and sets are a little confusing, but I think once you get used to the difference, it's probably a powerful feature. Third: you have to keep the program running, apparently, all the time; FontReserve is "transparent." Fourth: when a font is auto-activated in FontReserve, you can tell it's active because it has "active status" in the program window; with FontAgent, an auto-activated font does not show up as active, which is kind of weird. Fifth, the auto-activation in Photoshop is, by the company's admission, buggy, but they claim it will be better with Photoshop 8 (!). I should send this list of concerns to them. Positives: intuitive, cocoa platform and interface; font player is excellent; wysiwyg menus are very helpful; customizable specimen sheet was something I always wanted in FontReserve but never got (you can customize type color and background color as well!); a tiny download; easy to set up and use.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just got an update for my FontAgent Pro 1.3. The Insider Software email said: <br> <br>That brings us to FontAgent Pro 1.3, a new supercharged version of FontAgent Pro that makes saving of font sets 10x faster and greatly enhances printing in Classic mode. How did we do this you ask? We have added some great new engineers to our staff and we will be accelerating our development to bring you some truly incredible breakthrough technology in font management over the coming months.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Kapone, <br>Yes, I agree with Tiffany: let us know what you think about the upgrade. Apparently the upgrade is not available to trial users. Based on what I've seen so far as a trial user, I'm 50/50 on whether or not to abandon FontReserve. I'd be curious to see if you find 1.3 much better than 1.2.1. Thanks!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, after using the trial of FontAgent Pro 1.2 for nearly 30 days, I'm back to FontReserve. I think FontAgent has serious potential, but FontReserve is just more transparent to the user, facilitates easier exporting and importing of fonts, and is much faster. Exporting fonts in FontAgent Pro and shutting the program down was very slow. FontReserve is extremely quick. Also, the character map in FontReserve is very helpful. Some features in FontAgent are quite nice, such as the Font Player, font diagnostics, and its generally prettier, more OSX-like interface. But Reserve just seems better still.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I just bought suitcase and have had problems with it locking up while using Classic mode. Usually when this happens I'm not even able to use the force quit feature. I've resorted to pulling the battery out of my IBook so that I can restart the computer. <br> <br>The day I recieved my Suitcase application I read that the next version of OSX will have a font handling feature. Maybe it would be better to wait before you invest any more money.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm back to FontReserve in X, and happy as can be. I liked a few of the features of FontAgent Pro, but the speed and transparency of FontReserve brought me back. Before I invest in another 3rd party app, I, too, am going to wait for the Panther font handler to see how it works.</div>

<div class=commentbody>SeanMicheal, <br>I don't have that button. At least not in that location.
