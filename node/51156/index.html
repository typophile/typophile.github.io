<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-Sans_3615.jpg]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still very unsure about my skills (especially with the beziers) but hopefully I can finish this typeface. I have absolutely no background in graphic design nor type, except possibly for the influences I have acquired by reading stuff in the web. Books and other materials regarding typography are very sparse in my region, although I&rsquo;ve acquired Bringhurst&rsquo;s Elements of Typographic Style (3.0) and Hochuli&rsquo;s Detail in Typography.</p>
<p>I really want to finish this typeface, and I was aiming for a friendly yet clean sans-serif. It does look friendly to me, so far, but I&rsquo;m not quite sure. Any comments, tips, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. :)</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> New pdf attached.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Very nice for a first try. I like the lowercase a, and the little curved corners at the tops of the ascenders.</p>
<p>A few  things I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bottom of the o, p, and q don&rsquo;t overshoot the baseline (the d does).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bottom of the bowl of the d could be smoother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s intentional or not, but the i has some square corners an some slightly rounded corners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the r needs to be taller</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the curves n the p don&rsquo;t match the b, d, and q. Maybe it needs to be a bit wider?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for your input. I&rsquo;m glad you liked the lc a.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t actually aware that glyphs with curves at the base should cross over the line, but now that you&rsquo;ve said it, it does look off if, for example, the lc o just sits on the baseline.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve mentioned it, the r should be a wee bit taller. I&rsquo;m also aware that there are smoothness flaws in the lc b, d, q, and p. Will work on that asap. The lc i has some semi-serif qualities, and that is intentional. I tried a normal lc i before but it was too boring for my taste. I don&rsquo;t know if I should follow that pattern for the lc l, though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m unsure about your last point though. I want to retain the upper stem of r, n, and p for a distinct look, yet I don&rsquo;t want to copy that over to d, b, and q. I was actually thinking of an mirrored d for the lc b but I figured that would be too lazy of me. Haha. And it looked awkward anyway. So being aware of that, I tried to make differences with d and b. Now, lc p is derived from d and n, while q is from b (just a mirror). That&rsquo;s why, I think, the curves don&rsquo;t match.</p>
<p>Again, thank you for your comment. It helped a lot.</p>

<p>The new pdf containing these glyphs is in the first post.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take a break first&hellip; and brace myself for creating an s.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My comment about the lowercase i wasn&rsquo;t about the serif, but about the corners. Some are square, and some are slightly rounded (the lowercase l is the same way). You should probably pick one and be consistent throughout all the characters.</p>
<p>As far as the p, d, b, and q, I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t have said &ldquo;match.&rdquo;  They just need some more cohesiveness. They don&rsquo;t look like they all go together yet. Think of the curves like siblings. They don&rsquo;t look alike, but you should be able to tell they&rsquo;re related.</p>
<p>The bottom of the bowl of the p is flat, but the b curves up just a hair. The d curves up, but it&rsquo;s uneven. The q curves up the most, and to me, is the nicest looking. All those curves don;t have to be identical, but they should share the same DNA.</p>
<p>The r still seems too short, and the t just looks awkward. It seems odd having the crossbar below the x height.</p>
<p>You could use the a similar stem on the j (which is quite nice) for the t, and make it taller.</p>
<p>Have you started on your uppercase yet? I think when you do, you&rsquo;ll find that the ascenders on these lowercase characters are too low.</p>
