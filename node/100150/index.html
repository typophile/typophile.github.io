  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Well, not really!
I stumbled across this lettering in a fifties advert:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sensitive_3986.JPG]
As far as I know there are no digitizations of this style (House Industries' Studio Sable is similar). I want to make a font out of it, and was wondering if anybody knows of any lettering specimen where I might find a full alphabet of this style, or similar, to get a feel for how the other letters should look, rather than just expanding the charset myself by guesswork. I&rsquo;m in Thailand so any physical book is going to be hard to get hold of. Maybe there&rsquo;s a flickr or other online resource that I&rsquo;ve not been able to find? It won&rsquo;t be a straight revival, so even low res images would be helpful. I just want to get a feel of how it should look, then make it from scratch.
Cheers,
Dave</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The problem with hand lettering and research is there may not be a complete specimen of lettering you wish to digitize. Often lettering styles were handed down from a &ldquo;master&rdquo; (for lack of a better term) to apprentices with no formal specimen. Sometimes styles were the personal invention of the sign-writer cobbled together from pieces they picked up. Others were the adaptation of print letters to hand lettered brushwork. Some styles of lettering were completely regional. Worse, sign-writers could vary the letters from one basic format to produce cursive scripts, casuals (or money strokes), italics, or  calligraphy on the fly. Each would have the same characteristics but with a different brush or treatment each would be a completely different font by modern standards. There are several books covering hand lettering available, Speed Ball, Atkinson, Becker, etc., but don&rsquo;t be surprised if you can&rsquo;t find this variation.  The end result will generally be a collection of specimens and samples. From this you will build your font. Another possibility is to find an old sign painter or calligrapher to make a specimen and hope that he or she can duplicate this lettering.</p>
<p>Even if you find a complete specimen, there is no way to copy it verbatim. Such demonstration specimens were meant as  guides only. The artists were expected to adjust each character to fit the application. I&rsquo;ve heard purest say that their font was a true representation of the font as presented in the specimen. This means that it is crap. Hand lettered specimens are not composed as iron clad rules but rather as guides. Stroke widths, x-heights, character width, etc. will look great as long as all you do is spell out the glyphs as originally rendered. Anything else will need correction.</p>
<p>So, good luck and good hunting. Please don&rsquo;t listen to me. There is probably a real expert around here somewhere who will completely refute everything I&rsquo;ve written, and he or she is probably right. I only know from personal experience. I am still working on my script and I had a decent specimen.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, I&rsquo;ve looked through the Filmotype collection and Sudtipos Bluemlein collection. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be stepping on anyone&rsquo;s toes too much by digitizing this (as a font, not a perfect tracing of lettering!). I figured a near exact match in a lettering style guide would not exist; I was just after something close enough to help me deal with the typical problem letters like x, z, k and then maybe find something that could work as a matching upper case. I&rsquo;ve gathered a collection of lettering styles (via Google image search) from 30s to 60s, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll have enough to do a kind of mash-up, but keep it a consistent looking face. I&rsquo;m not into revivals, I just really like the feel of this sample. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes&hellip;</div>

That&rsquo;s really helpful. I&rsquo;d looked at Hipster Script already as a similar style. I think the sample I found has a more condensed and bolder feel, but these scans will be really useful in working out some basic letter shapes before seeing where the design goes. It was the g and y in the advert that got me liking it so much, so hopefully I can get a lot of the feel of those letters into the others. I think if I use these scans together with some samples I&rsquo;ve already found for inspiration, I can make something new, which won&rsquo;t look like a Hipster Script rip-off.</p>

<p>Maybe this can help, as the basic structure of the letters are quite similar&hellip;.
Scanned from the book called &ldquo;Scripts&rdquo; by Rand Holub, 1950. Keep in mind that Ale Paul already digitized it (and expanded by adding ligatures, swashes, etc, etc, etc&hellip;) as Hipster Script.

<p>Also, why shady? Not at all.
If someone does a revival, why would you deny the same possibility to everyone else? No ones gets to get exclusivity on public domain revivals. If you want to get exclusivity, you should do something completely new instead.</p>
<p>Personally, I welcome diversity and I like very much that there are a lot of different version of each revival. So you can choose, for example, the Caslon or the Baskerville that best fit your taste or your intended use, or the one that gives you best results under different printing methods, or the one that renders best on the screen, etc&hellip;</p>
