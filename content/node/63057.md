    guidelines say it is <a href=\"stohttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/slate_std_complete_vp/\">Slate</a>
    from Monotype. (Here is a link)\r\nhttp://www.trinet.com/gevity/for_the_press.htm\r\n\r\nBottom
    of the page were it says 'TriNet Logos'. Download that and it's on pg 2.03 of
