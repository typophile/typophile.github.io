  body: Kurt Schwitter's "Ursonate" is definitely not the same without diacritics.
    [[http://www.costis.org/x/schwitters/ursonate.htm|This]] is how it's supposed
    to sound and look.

  body: "Ah, you're very welcome, Nina. The Anglosphere's ignorance of and even arrogance
    towards other languages annoys me ever so slightly. We work hard to master their
    language, while they think the little dots and rings and hooks and stuff we put
    on our letters are just some cute or quaint, inconsequential decoration.\r\n\r\nAnd
    thanks for not mentioning my misspelling of Kurt Schwitters' name. It was just
    a slip, I swear."

    in this thread to mention the (IMO very cool) newer version spoken by Jaap Blonk,
    with dynamically generated type in motion by Golan Levin:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgNL8-FdG-k"

    translation will bring about a world where the speakers of other languages will
    share the good fortune we speakers of English now enjoy - not being forced to
    spend the years of arduous labor and memorization required to learn a second language.
