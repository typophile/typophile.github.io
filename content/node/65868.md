body: "I am finally giving a lecture on my vast collection of handmade typography
  used by merchants to mark pieces of cloth that were sent around the world from manchester,
  England in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\r\nThe type was handmade, by hammering
  copper strips into fruit wood blocks, and many fonts are unique to the textile trade.
  I have never shown these items before and am hoping that someone will be able to
  make use or at least be inspired by this unseen part of typographic history.\r\nThe
  Type Directors Club, based in the Garment District of NYC, seems a perfect location
  for this lecture. I will be showing original sample books, blocks, lettering and
  describing the history of this long gone typography.\r\n\r\nPlease come along or
  pass the invite along to anyone who may be interested in the event.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nAdrian

  body: "I am a photographer and could put together a website but really the collection
    has many varied strands to it, from art history to typography etc so I haven't
    got around to even thinking about a website.\r\nThe talk is hopefully a first
    step in getting the information out there. I was a guest on the Antiques Roadshow
    when it went to Manchester but apart from that, this collection has just been
    sat around. \r\nTobias Frere Jones came to see part of the collection and he thought
    many of the fonts were unique to the textile trade but that was maybe 3 years
    ago and I have done nothing since in terms of displaying them.\r\nI am hoping
    the lecture will generate some interest and hopefully lead to an exhibition or
    maybe some of the fonts could be digitized.\r\n\r\nI really have no idea but they
    are wonderful objects.\r\n\r\nAdrian"

  body: "I was on the show in 2005 and was asked to show and talk about the collection
    asa guest for about 4 minutes.\r\n\r\nI wrote a book years ago (in fact it was
    on a floppy disc for a while!) but again, I never got around to publishing. I
    know there are a lot more outlets and even self publishing is easy nowadays but
    again it is finding time while trying to run a location photography business.\r\nI
    really appreciate your link though.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nAdrian"

    printing buisness at the moment. I am greatly interested in these stamps and wondered
    if you knew of any books which display a range or whether you are thinking of
    creating a book like this. I think I could take a lot of insperation from them.
    \r\nHope you can help.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLS"
