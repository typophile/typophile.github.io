body: "I have made a handful of fonts but this is my first script, which I have only
  roughed in. I am using TypeTool. When I test the font in Illustrator or PhotoShop
  CS4 the joins in the lower case i and j are knocking out from the glyphs they overlap.
  The problem does not show when printed and goes away when I outline the font. It
  does not appear in TextEdit, Apple Mail, or Microsoft Word.\r\n\r\nAny advice on
  what I did wrong?\r\n\r\nImage attached.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMatt[img:sites/default/files/old-images/navyscreenshot_6469.jpg]"

  body: Check the direction of your outlines-- if you're generating the font in TrueType
    format, first select all glyphs and run <strong>Set TT Direction</strong> from
    the Contour > Paths menu.
