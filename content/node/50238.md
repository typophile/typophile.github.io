  body: "I think PERSIMMON may be a mix of Casablanca Condensed and Triplex Sans Condensed.
    See them both on this page of the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces3.html|Bauhaus-style
    Font ID Guide]]\r\n\r\nIt's possible COUNTRY CLUB comes from the same 'font',
    but that Y is not in either of the two I mentioned.\r\n\r\n.- Mike Yanega"

    is a fair match for Persimmon, but still not that Y.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: '[img:sites/default/files/old-images/persimmon-logo_4236.jpg] thanks for your
    assistance. Those are close, but I went with Bodega Sans and extended it and letterspaced
    it to mock it up close enough. I know, blasphemy to the true typograher nature,
    but I got over that a few years ago when I quit priding myself on being able to
    duplicate logos. I figure if I''d been born in Michelangelo''s time I''d be making
    a living duplicating works of art instead of creating them. Rick Kirkman'

title: What is this font? Almost close to Bodega Sans, but not horseshoes or hand
  grenades!
