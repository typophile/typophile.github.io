  (in the UK)... but was surprised to discover that most of the typefaces I had in
  mind (Gill, Futura, Kabel etc) as characteristic of the 30s were actually designed
  in the 20s... clearly I needed to return to the textbooks! - but further research
  still didn't really turn up anything suitable from the period.\r\n\r\nSo I'd be
  very grateful for suggestions of (sans?) typefaces from the second half of the 30s
  that aren't too eccentric or deco (the project has plenty of deco ornament already),
  and which don't look 'historical' - ie which still look contemporary enough to pass.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks, in advance, Team Typophile :-)\r\n"

    it would be during the '30s that it became really common. I have British signpainting
    and lettering books from the '30s and late '40s in which hand drawn versions of
    Gill are the only example of a sans alphabet.\r\n\r\nI guess it also depends what
    sort of publication you are referencing. It might only be an art or design publication
    from the late '30s that would be employing any very recent type designs."

  body: I think you would be better off looking at what was used during the 30s, and
    worry slightly less about when the typefaces were designed. Type was a slower-moving
    industry in that era. A typeface was a pretty big investment for both the foundry
    and the printers who bought it, so faces released in the 20s would still have
    enjoyed quite a lot of exposure in the 30s.

  body: "Justin (edit: and Ultrasparky and Paragraph :-)\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your
    replies. Your point about acceptance / application / ubiquity is judicious, and
    very well taken, of course there isn't a more English face on the planet, and
    I certainly don't need much encouragement to reach for Gill at the best of times...
    but I was disappointed that a period I'd always rather uncritically accepted as
    the dawn of modern sans-serifyness actually turns out rather light on faces. For
    this project, I'm very comfortable with an artier, more up to date slant on the
    period if you have any suggestions in that direction...\r\n\r\nConsulting my faithful
    Opie scrapbook, there are lots of anonymous sans faces to be seen in common use
    - though i certainly grant you Gill's circular 'O' seems to have been (ahem) highly
    influential... or at least to have captured a zeitgeist.\r\n\r\nMetro is, at a
    pinch, in period, but - sorry to display my lack of discrimination here - honestly
    I've always found its quirky f rather distracting... so yes, I may well end up
    opting for Gill, for all the reasons you recommend - but I admit I was rather
    hoping to have overlooked something obvious - or failing one always live in hopes
    of unearthing hidden treasure."

    thinking text or display.\r\nGill Sans was most used, but has always been popular,
    so not exclusively representative of that era.\r\nIMO, the condensed geometric
    sans style, as seen in the word DAKS here in a 1938 ad in <em>Punch</em>, was
    a feature of the immediate pre-war era, but not used much subsequently. Tourist
    Gothic Alternates."

  body: "Poms\r\n\r\nThanks for your (implicit, but very useful) counsel that *looking
    the part* is a very good substitute for authenticity! I fixate easily on historical
    specifics, and it's well worth pausing to reflect perhaps that only a tiny minority
    of the audience will appreciate them, whereas broader strokes arguably communicate
    more widely.\r\n\r\nI'm a huge fan of TF-J and Nobel is a gorgeous face, but perhaps
    a little too adrift of the period, however (despite everything i was just saying
    about quirky 'f's!) Verlag is a compelling argument for period spirit over strict
    authenticity. (Ditto, Neuta).\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your thought-provoking suggestions"
