  where I had three type families to work with, and that's it, so I'm ignorant (though
  wanting to learn) to the legalities of using type. \r\n\r\nIf I design someone's
  resume (and get paid for it), I would need commercial licensing for any fonts I
  use, correct? If I don't get paid, that would fall under personal use?\r\n\r\nRight
  now I'm volunteer designing for a non-profit. They have no style guide, they have
  a pretty unattractive logo (that can't be changed), I'm starting from scratch trying
  to give them well designed publications from here on out. They use Arial and AvantGarde
  in the logo. Am I allowed to use those fonts that the company has to create the
  style guide and other publications? \r\n\r\nOne more topic... If I purchase fonts
  with commercial licenses, am I then allowed to use them for any client on any project?
  And if the font is in a logo can the client then use their logo, that I created,
  however they want? \r\n\r\nThanks, I know it's a lot of questions."

    source fonts can all be used in producing work that you get paid to produce, and
    that your clients can print, publish, and generally commercially exploit. Many
    licenses don't even mention this because, er, that's what fonts are for. Occasionally
    you might find a commercial font license that includes some kind of exclusion
    - but these are rare. General advice is read the license (AKA the EULA.) \r\n\r\nWhere
    things do become somewhat murky is the free fonts you find floating around on
    the web, which often come with no written license, or one that makes little sense.
    So in short paying your $20 for a font doesn't guarantee a well written EULA but
    it certainly increases the odds.\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    won't allow some things like logo use, but as i work for a non-profit and thought
    this was a little weird, i simply emailed the font designer and he cleared it
    up for me. \r\n\r\npoint being - being in doubt ask.\r\n\r\nall the best!"
