    looking at? Mine is the No. 5.

  body: "Based of the age of the typewriter I discerned from looking at this [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/18378305@N00/3755496011/sizes/l/in/photostream/
    | picture]] and examining more of the letters, this typeface has not been digitized.
    Its prior to Folio, and Helvetica, but not Akzidenz which was made in 1896. The
    Underwood No. 5 was made 1924.\r\n\r\nMost of the letters are Grotesk but W and
    V are Geometric. \r\nAs Spock would say, \u201CFascinating\u201D.\r\n\r\nIf it\u2019s
    this kind of quirkiness you like, then you\u2019ll really dig Figgins Sans:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/figgins-sans/\r\n\r\nMike
