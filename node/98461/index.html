  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey there! I&rsquo;m thinking about making my own font editing program for the PC. I&rsquo;d like to know how hard it is? I mean what programming language is required to learn and to what level to design a simple font editor (is it C++?)? 
Like if I started learning today, could I have a finished product within 6-12 months? Anyone here have a clue?
Thanks :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s like any other programming job. I don&rsquo;t know anything about finances, so I cannot write a book-keeping program. I <em>do</em> know a lot about the internals of font files, so it only took me about 6 months to go from idea to a fully working program, to convert existing curves into one of the common font file formats.</p>
<p>The hard part is not actually your currently  (possibly non-)existing programming experience. You are talking about a lot of different things here:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;font <em>editing</em>&quot;: this requires you to learn how to read a font file format (and there are dozens, and at least two file formats are more or less mandatory for any &ldquo;editor&rdquo;). You should not only be be able to <em>read</em> the file format but <em>write</em> it as well, which are two different things. If you read a file and write it back without changing anything, optimally &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; should be different &ndash; a tall order in itself.</li>
<li>&ldquo;editor&rdquo; implies a graphical interface. If you never wrote one before, don&rsquo;t start with a font editor &hellip; Font editing is something special among graphic (vector) image software, it has a couple of demands of its own.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is it C++?&rdquo; What &ldquo;is&rdquo;? The language you need? The language commonly used for font editors? On what platform? For Mac OSX, it&rsquo;s (probably!) Objective-C. Cross-platform solutions can use Java. Using a scripting language, you can leverage the functionality of existing software to include font editing; I used Javascript to add it to Adobe InDesign.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, your question only raises more questions, and only you can answer them for yourself.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Jong! Pretty detailed answer there. :)</p>
<p>Just wondering, where do you suggest I start this journey? I think I might actually make it for Mac OS X, so I guess I first need to learn Objective C and then.. what&rsquo;s next? How do I learn to make a GUI and vector editing program?
I think I might stick to one format for now to simplify things. OTF is universal so just that is ok right?
What books are available on learning how to read and write font file formats?</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First of all, what&rsquo;s your programming experience/knowledge level like?</p>
<p>Second, what kind of fonts are you looking at editing?  A bitmap font drawing tool probably isn&rsquo;t too hard in a technical sense for a relatively inexperienced programmer, at least given a high-level language like Java (or a good RAD environment), but you&rsquo;ll still need to know basic programming techniques.  If you want to actually save and load font files (even bitmap), managing the file layout would add a whole other dimension.  Doable in 6-12 months?  Certainly, as long as you&rsquo;re either familiar with programming or a <em>very</em> diligent learner (and don&rsquo;t need much of a social life).  A &lsquo;finished&rsquo; product?  There&rsquo;s no such thing, in my experience.  Speaking as a programmer myself, &lsquo;good enough for another release&rsquo; is about as much as you can hope for&hellip;</p>
<p>For an outline font editor (including TrueType, PostScript, OpenType, etc.) you would need an entire other set of skills like vector drawing techniques.  Knowledge of reasonably-advanced (at least Bachelor&rsquo;s level) mathematics would be useful, although you might possibly get away with less if you can find a very good spline-handling library.  I won&rsquo;t even try to put a time estimate on that.  I suspect even George Williams would be well challenged, starting 100% from scratch, to produce something decently usable within a year.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think Theunis and Alex (altsan) have put your question in the right track, regarding technical &amp; GUI complexity. My opinion is that even for an experienced programmer, 1 man-year is not enough to produce a decently usable vector font editor.</p>
<p>More than this, if you want to elevate this editor to an actual product to sell, your most optimistic estimate must  be in the 3+ man-years range, taking into account features as read/write of all-font-formats (OTF/TTF/Type-1) support, Advanced vector editing GUI/techniques, Font (auto)Hinting, (auto) Kerning, Import/Export to common formats, Help &amp; Documentation, Extensive Testing &amp; Bug Fixing in all platforms, A web site to promote sell your product, A decent DRM system, etc.</p>
<p>My thoughts, -given you possible inexperience in programming- are:</p>
<p>=&gt; I don&rsquo;t think iOS is an appropriate environment for a full vector-font editor. iPhone is too small and even iPad would present a user with a difficult interface, too far from the easiness &amp; precision a PC/Mac can offer.</p>
<p>=&gt; Learning/mastering a new language as Objective C or C++ at the same time you are working in a complex project like a Vector-Font-Editor is a guaranty of both frustration (why this crashes/not working?) and a bad final product quality. Start with a much simpler project, like e.g. a simple vector editor to read/write/edit an EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) file, and gradually add Guidelines, Grid, Snap Tools, etc. until you feel confident to handle more complex file formats and data structures.</p>
<p>=&gt; Objective C  is an interesting, powerful language but it works only on Mac OS/iOS environments. If you decided to go the route of learning a new language I propose a <strong>[[http://www.developer.nokia.com/Develop/Qt/|C++/Nokia Qt]]<em></strong> combination which is actually a multi-platform solution: You write the Application once and (with one or two twinks) it compiles/runs under Windows/Mac/Linux, but be aware that Qt Creator GUI editor is not as good as MS-Visual Studio (for Windows) or X-Code (for Mac OS). 
(</em>) Nokia Qt is an Open Source product delivered with an LGPL license, which practically means you can even use it on a commercial application without buying it, as long as you include Qt in DLLs format.</p>
<p>=&gt; This is a useful/fast/free/open-source/high quality library to read &amp; render most formats of vector &amp; bitmap fonts files: <strong>[[http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/index.html|Freetype2]]</strong>
You can read/render and I think you also have access to font&rsquo;s vector data, but it does not support editing or creating/saving a new font file.</p>
<p>Good luck with your project ;)</p>

That is nonsense. The Adobe OpenType FDK is out there for everyone to use, or to implement in software. All the major font editors have this FDK built-in to generate OpenType font files. And I cannot remember that Adobe put out a similar kind of FDK for PostScript Type 1 fonts some 25 years ago. Because that was a time when the real “font wars” were happening – between PostScript and TrueType – and not now.</p>
<p>There is only one reason why font designers/developers have to work with tools that are less than ideal sometimes: because they are a small audience. Therefore development of font editors/tools is done by small companies – usually only one programmer – that cannot invest vast resources to make every user happy. That is how the font industry works. Deal with it.</p>

<p>No: that is nonsense. The AOFDK is an afterburner, not a complete font design environment. IMHO, none of the font creation packages currently available have sensible drawing tools, nor are they complete. Fontographer still suffers from Macromedia&rsquo;s inane decision to include fractional em sizes, and FontLab&rsquo;s generated TrueType fonts often fail in one or more areas when run through MS Font Validator.

<p>IMHO, that&rsquo;s an excellent suggestion. Personally, I would recommend studying the vector editing tools (including the curve smoothing slider) in CorelDraw 9 or 10, if you can find them. The SINGLE node editing tool is vastly superior to AI&rsquo;s approach, and the single-level contextual menu is also preferable to FontLab&rsquo;s layered approach.</p>

Define ‘sensible’, define ‘complete’. All highly subjective matter.</p>

And Fontographer 3.x wasn’t without limitations? No access to all font info. No support for hinting. Ever tried generating TrueTypes with it? Or Windows Type-1 fonts?</p>
<p>Twenty years ago the majority of type designers only had to produce PostScript Type-1 fonts for Mac, that would predominantly be used by designers in dedicated design apps such as Quark XPress, Illustrator or Photoshop. I agree that was easy and convenient.
These days are over, and we have to support customers who use many more applications on increasingly more operating systems. So we have to deal with the same kind of headaches that most software developers have to do: compatibility. But in return we also have a much larger market out there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding simple vectore editing tool vs AFDKO vs full-fledged visual editor etc, it makes sense to separate the different elements, especially drawing tool and font-generation tool. Each is a challenge in itself, at least if one wants to get it right. It is not by accident, I assume, that full-fledged editors rely on existing libraries e.g. for font generation, like a built-in AFDKO. Once you have this separation, you are free to combine any drawing tool with any font-generation tool.</div>

<p>I presume that English is not your first language, which may explain your reading comprehension problems. The subject of this thread is Font Editing software; hence, that was the subject I was discussing, so my comments about the AFDKO stand, and your comments remain nonsense.</p>
<p>As I understand it, Apple and Microsoft worked jointly on the Truetype format to overcome some of the limitations of Apple&rsquo;s original implementation of PS1 fonts, especially the annoying problems of separate screen and printer fonts. Also, in my experience, Fontographer 3.x did a quite credible job of generating TTF fonts: many of my initial, humble freeware efforts from fifteen years ago are still being used by cheapskates; in fact, I was somewhat surprised to find several of them preinstalled on the HP computer I bought about six years ago.</p>
<p>No, FOG 3x wasn&rsquo;t a perfect design and production tool, but font life was a little simpler then. Sometimes, less <em>is</em> more&hellip;</p>

<p>Fog 3.x made bloated TT, still does, so does FL. Those old tools were simple, and if all you make today are what you made then, you are fine. If not, then you need to get out more often.</p>
<p>Since the development of UFO, tool development based on monumental application development and a proprietary font format, vs really good modules, is a bit silly, but still they try.:)</p>

<p>You presume too much :Þ Apple has always been about making technology as idiotproof as possible; unfortunately, American culture seems to be quite adept at creating bigger and better idiots. MS improved a marginal product: by calling the process collaboration, I was being uncharacteristically kind to Apple. And I am well aware of Abode&rsquo;s role with the PS1 format: in the 1980s, I operated dedicated typesetting equipment&ndash;the kind <em>real</em> typographic professionals used before the advent of desktop publishing/design by divas. In fact, I created my first digital fonts in 1983 for the Chyron IV character generator at KXAS-TV, the NBC affiliate in Fort Worth-Dallas.</p>
