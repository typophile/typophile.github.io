  this a few weeks ago but dropped cause it's verry user unfriendly but i'm starting
  to believe it's worth the frustration.\r\n\r\nAnyway, i searched a lot, or my search
  terms are that bad or i'm the only one having trouble.\r\n\r\nInstalling it was
  no problem but now i'm reading\r\nCommandLineHowTo.pdf\r\n\r\nI think everything
  i had to do failed cause it was not in my terminal but nothing serious i guess.
  Mostly small things like never seeing the option:\r\n\r\n\u201CUse Settings as Defaults\u201D\r\n\r\nI
  gues the terminal has changed over the years.\r\nanyway now i'm here:\r\n\r\n+++\r\nTo
  change the prompt, you need to edit an obscure file that sets parameters for the
  Terminal pro- gram when it starts up. Unfortunately, the way the Terminal program
  works depends on which Unix command line program it is setup to use. There are several,
  and each one uses a different name for its startup file, and requires a different
  line of text added to change the prompt. To see which one you have, under the Terminal
  menu option, choose \u201CPreferences...\u201D, and note the line of text in the
  top text field.\r\n\r\nProgram name       Startup file name        Line to add\r\ncsh
  \               .cshrc                   set prompt=\"%c$ \"\r\ntcsh               .cshrc
  \                  set prompt=\"%c$ \"\r\nsh                 .profile                 PS1='\\W
  $ '\r\nzsh                .profile                 PS1='\\W $ '\r\nbash               .bash_profile
  \           PS1='\\W $ '\r\n\r\n+++\r\n\r\nOnly there is no text in the topfield?
  what do i need to do now?\r\nI got terminal 'version 2.1(272)'"

    At the command lines, type \u201Cecho $SHELL\u201D and it will tell you what shell
    you\u2019re using. I\u2019m pretty sure the default on 10.4+ is Bash, although
    if you have carried settings over from older accounts it might be Csh. \r\n\r\nIf
    you want to work with the command line more as you get used to the FDK, I recommend
    that you pick up the books \u201DTeach Yourself UNIX in 24 Hours\u201D and \u201CUNIX
    in a Nutshell.\u201D My copies are pretty old but there are probably books just
    about using the BSD UNIX system that Mac OS runs on. "

  body: "I suspect that you would do better with FontLab than the FDK. The FDK was
    written by a programmer (me) for type designers who are already well-versed in
    the Unix command-line. Its strengths are that it is scriptable and you can share
    or copy the meta-data files, like the GlyphOrderAndAliasDB and feature files,
    between similar faces and families. This is very important if you are managing
    a large library, and the overall time-savings then are well worth the price of
    the highly non-obvious tools and options and lack of documentation. Relative to
    FontLab, getting a new family started takes a lot more up-front work and planning,
    but making a change and rebuilding is much faster. Last month I had to add a name
    ID 8 entry to the name table of several thousand fonts. With Bbedit, Python, and
    the FDK, this took me three hours, including verifying that nothing else changed
    in the fonts. However, if you are working with a simple four face family, then
    you will get done a lot faster with FontLab. Also, the FDK tools are very Type2/CFF
    cnetric, and can't do a lot with TrueType fonts. That said, now for your questions:\r\n\r\n\"how
    do i get those unicode values?\"\r\n\r\nWhat James Puckett said, unicode.org.
    One of the easiest files to browse is:\r\nhttp://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.txt\r\n\r\n\"\u2026does
    it matter if there are unicode values in the file of glyphs that are not in my
    font?\"\r\n\r\nNo. Be aware, however, that the makeotf will add Unicode values
    for any glyphs with  known glyph names, using a hard-coded list of glyph name
    to Unicode values.\r\n\r\n\"what is the function of:\r\nPS1=\u2019\\W $ \"\r\n\r\nSetting
    this is not at all required. However, the default setting is to show the entire
    absolute path of the current working directory before the prompt. Since I often
    work in deep directory trees with absolute paths of a hundred letters or more,
    the default setting leaves me with very little space on the command-line to actually
    enter a command. The setting I recommend gives you the current directory name,
    which is at least a clue about where you are in the directory tree, without making
    too long a prompt.\r\n\r\n\"how do i get a .pfa format?\"\r\n\r\nIf your goal
    is to make an OpenType font with TrueType glyph outlines, then you don't need
    to - just specify your *.ttf file as the source font file for makeotf. This will
    result in an output OpenType font with the original TrueType glyph outlines from
    your source. When doing this, however, you need to be aware of  three issues.
    The biggest issue is  that the currently posted version of the FDK does not make
    valid TTF fonts - if you want to do this, contact me at rroberts@adobe.com, and
    I will send you the fix. The second is that the makeotf tool can't change the
    glyph order of TTF fonts. This means that you can use the GlyphOrderAndAliasDb
    file to change glyph names and assign Unicode values, but not to re-order glyphs.\r\nThe
    last is that the autohint tool won't work on TTF font files, and the checkOutlines
    tools will report issues, but can't fix them. The FDK is pretty Type1/Type2 centric.\r\n\r\nIf
    you do want to convert your TTF to a Type 1  font file so as to work more easily
    with the FDK tools, the program to use is 'tx\". The command-line is\r\n \"tx
    -t1  <input ttf font file path> <output Type1 font path>\"\r\ne.g.\r\n \"tx -t1
    \ myfont.ttf   myfont.pfa\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"
