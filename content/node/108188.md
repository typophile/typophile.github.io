  body: It is frequently helpful to tell us where, when and in what form (book cover,
    store sign, etc.) this is from. My immediate impression is hand drawn.

  body: It looks Art Nouveau style and could easily have been made into a font from
    lettering - I have looked at several source books of Art Nouveau lettering but
    have not found this specific one.

    bigining othe this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10BGx93HJPE, but the film
    maker doesn't remember the name.\r\n\r\n@ bojev : Indeed, it is very similar to
    Art Nouveau style (ITC Benguiat or Baldessare). But impossible to find the same
    rounded font."

    also has some ideas as to how a Paris alphabet could look.\r\nDon"

  body: "Too bad the film maker can't recall where he got the word \"Paris.\" BTW,
    shortest trip I've ever taken to Paris but it brought back many memories :)\r\nDrew
    a blank with my Art Nouveau files. \r\nI suppose you could make it by editing
    Benguiat*. \r\nFor swirls like the S you could look at:\r\nTypo Upright:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/typo-upright/alternate_cuts.html\r\nZephyr\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/zephyr/\r\nor
    University Roman:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/university-roman/\r\nDon\r\n*Edited:
    Replaced Baldessare with Benguiat. I standardized the size of Baldessare [copyright
    1993] and ITC Benguiat Std Book [copyright 1985] and and found that the digital
    outlines were almost a perfect match.\r\n"
