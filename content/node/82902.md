body: "I had to restore my computer to factory settings and a font disappeared that
  I used on my labels, business card etc. (Giraffe).\r\nThe weird thing is that when
  I searched for it online the 'Giraffe' font I found is completely different. I contacted
  the font creator and he said he hasn't changed it.\r\nI'm very meticulous about
  recording font names and have been using this one for a couple of years and know
  it was called 'Giraffe' so I am completely baffled.\r\nThe only logical conclusion
  is that the creator of the font I was using changed the name to something else.
  Would really appreciate some help finding this font. Already tried Identifont but
  no joy.\r\nThanks, Aline\r\n"
