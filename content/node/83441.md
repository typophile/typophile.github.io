body: It seems that magazine ads for trademarked drugs are always accompanied by a
  page or two of legal boilerplate that's set in Arial or Times New Roman. All the
  medical qualifications and patient warnings are no doubt required as protection
  against potential lawsuits, and not intended to promote reading, but I wonder if
  there's a marketing psychology when wealthy drug companies use a PC system font
  in their magazine ads. Do you think the reliance on PC system fonts is mostly to
  discourage reading of the legal boilerplate or is it equally designed to suggest
  the drug companies are just plain folks who stick to the fonts already installed
  on their computers? My personal assumption is the latter.

  body: "I believe the FDA is on record as permitting drug warning disclaimers in
    magazine ads (as opposed to such warnings in prescription bottles) to use any
    clear and legible font that's at least 8 point. The FDA's formal typography standards
    are posted online at:  \r\n\r\nwww.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-03-17/pdf/99-6296.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If minimum size, defined in points, is the requirement, it makes sense to
    play it safe and use a default system font.\r\nUsing something that is smaller
    on the em (or, for that matter, condensed) to take up less space, could be contentious."

  body: "I'm a graphic designer and one of my clients is a large pharmaceutical company.
    I've never done a magazine ad for them, but based on my general experiences working
    with them my guess is that a manager either said:  1) \"regulators require that
    we do it this way\", or else 2) \"regulators have approved disclaimers done this
    way so let's not try something different\".\r\n\r\nIf a certain font and point
    size has been approved by regulators in the past, they'll play it safe and stick
    with those specs."
