body: Can anyone recommend any beautiful elegant, dainty (sp?) slab serifs? Thinking
  about ones that come in thin weights as this will help in communicating the elegance
  factor. I know i have seen a few in recent publications and art gallery invites
  but ive no idea what they are or where to purchase. Any tips anyone? The new typeface
  Archer springs to mind, but any others anyone else can recommend?
