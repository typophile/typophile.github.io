body: I&#39;ve a client who needs some resource material to which he can refer prior
  to presenting a new typeface to a client of his. <BR>&#39;Branding with Type&#39;-S.Rogener,
  is too basic, the guy knows a sans from a serif...but he needs some confidence building/deeper
  understanding. <BR>are there any books or websites you&#39;d recommend?

    be helpful. Hesitated to recommend it earlier as the resources I include may lead
    your customer to other sources ;-&#41;  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/FontPortal.aspx?PID=4"

    target="_blank">Designing Brand Identity</a> in the NAB bookstore yesterday. Seems
    to have some solid information in it which could be used to assist your client
    as well. <BR> <BR>Also look for: <BR>The Brand Gap by Marty Neumeier <BR>The 22
