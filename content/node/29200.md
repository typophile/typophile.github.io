    BC - kudos. As for me...\r\n\r\nAesthetically speaking - it starts off as a strong,

  body: Leaving politics out of the equation and thinking generally, I'd definitely
    try to go with something American, if possible. I'd suggest a bold sans-serif,
    preferably one with pretty subtle quirks so that it won't be too distracting (but
    some are good). It'd be nice if you could use a somewhat uncommon sans; the current
    administration is constantly being attacked for their terrible, Photoshop-esque
    banners, so an interesting typeface might be the first step to improving at least
    that reputation. A quick suggestion would be <a href=http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/list_fontfamily.cfm/family/Metro_Sans>Metro</a>,
    a typeface that I'm personally looking at, designed by W.A. Dwiggins.

  body: Minion Web. It's similar enough to Bodoni and its derivatives that it fits
    ones expectations for the GOP, but the thick serifs will keep it readable in web
    graphics and prevent the serifs from buzzing on interlaced televisions.
