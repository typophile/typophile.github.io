body: My assignment was to develop a label to be woven and a printed hangtag for men&#39;s
  faux fur jackets. Color and size are being used to convey a degree of edginess to
  a somewhat classic design and also to give the item hangar appeal against a ground
  of dark fur. I been searching for an old english type font that distinguishes the
  &#34;K&#34; as such and not be misread as an &#34;R&#34;...this is Schwabacher.
  Keep in mind that there is a need to keep it simple as the label will be woven.  <BR>TIA
  for your critique and suggestions.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67746.jpg"

  body: The crown is undoable. Its too complicated. I&#39;d loose the white stroke
    on Kingdom its doen&#39;t add any separation from the yellow. Its not needed.
    Did you explore shapes other than a rectangle for your label? An oval or circle
    could be as much a part of the idenity as the name. Good start, keep going

  body: I may second what Daniel said about the crown, you may have to simplify it,
    a lot.. <BR> <BR><i>&#40; The mark itself slightly reminds me of &#39;Lonsdale&#39;,
    which may not be a good thing, for various reasons.. But, maybe thats just the
    lion, and maybe thats just me, and my &#39;dislike&#39; for the typical &#39;fans&#39;
    of the &#39;Lonsdale&#39; brand over here.. &#41;</i> <BR> <BR><i>Oh, and, &#39;Welcome

  body: So embarrassed by my multi-posting...didn&#39;t realize that the forum wasn&#39;t
    Safari friendly and wasn&#39;t able to edit. I totally reworked the lion and the
    crown. The first one was looking more and more like a poodle.  <BR> <BR>Appreciate
    the welcome...hit me!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67785.jpg"

  body: I really prefer the redraw you&#39;ve made. I will suggest to move the crown
    to the left a bit, just over the very middle  or somewhere near of the middle
    of his head. I think you have to work on the paw too, to eliminate the effect
    of  a hoof.  I also notice you have eliminate the white line around the word Kingdom,
    I will suggest to you to keep this line.

  body: Wow...that&#39;s a lot of improvement from the first to the second. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    contradict AndrZ and say that it&#39;s better without the white border around
    the type.

  body: I definitely think your second variation hits the mark better and I&#39;ll
    agree with Darrel about leaving the white stroke out of the picture. A couple
    of things I would suggest

  body: My thought about the white stroke is also practicle. Why would you want to
    incur the added expense of sewing that stroke? I could see it if you had white
    somewhere else on the label.

  body: Aloha! <BR>I still have to clean up his paws and the upper tooth but I rushed
    to tweak my color settings so hopefully you will see the correct color...not road
    sign yellow but a very bright chartreuse! I used the white stroke with my initial
    draft to balance the white in the crown and to give the text a bit of definition.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks all for your expert advice!  <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68006.gif"
