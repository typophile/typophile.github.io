  also the most user friendly and easy to use/learn.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you
  guys! Any help will be appreciated, Thanks!"

  body: What OS? <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/?CJPID=2394569">TypeTool</a>
    is probably the best entry-level editor. You can move up to FontLab (used by most
    professionals) later.

  body: "Hello\r\n\r\nyeah... Actually I've already installed Fontographer bojev just
    because it's an open source software, but it seems to have all the functionalities
    to build a proper font which is great! On my research I found a lot of font editors
    and someone in an article said that fontographer is very similar to Fontlab Studio
    which costs $649! What do you reckon? Do you agree with this? Just because at
    the moment I can't afford Fontlab... Well I'll give fontographer a try during
    the weekend and let's see what happens!\r\nBy the way Stephen I'm using Mac\r\n\r\nMassive
    thank you to both of you!"

    hinting, scripting, or building type families. '

  body: "@nitrofurano:\r\n<cite>i think Fontforge is software-libre (gpl-compatible),
    not open-source</cite>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, people will continue to call Linux
    an open-source operating system... <em>and</em> they will continue to call it
    Linux instead of GNU/Linux too.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the term \"open-source\"
    is sometimes applied also to software that is not free software, that is not under
    the GNU or BSD licenses - where the source is visible in a \"look-but-don't-touch\"
    fashion. But the basic thing here is that while GNU has proposed some alternative
    vocabulary, it hasn't really caught on, and so I can't recommend using their terminology
    if you want to be readily understood by the largest possible audience."

    ($399 US) - that being said to go back to your original question of best and easy
    to learn or user friendly - I will stick with Fontographer as my recommendation.
    Having taught it for a number of years I can say that it is quick to learn and
    students output product sooner with as little trouble as is possible for a  font
    editor. '

    I think I'm getting too long just for only one character... =S Thanks god the
    program is well documented =)

  body: "It depends on what you mean by \"all letters and punctuation,\" what quality
    level is desired, and how experienced you are.\r\n\r\nThere is a big learning
    curve on doing this well. Proper outline construction is complicated. Spacing
    can also be very tricky. If your handwriting font has connecting letters, spacing
    is much easier, but getting connections right is equally challenging.\r\n\r\nAt
    the extremes, there are a few people who can do a basic English alphabet, numerals
    and basic punctuation (70-80 glyphs) in  maybe two hours\u2014usually with all
    sorts of tricks and automation assistance\u2014and people who have taken several
    person-years to do the same.\r\n\r\nI expect that my speed is a bit more average.
    I can prototype a design with that same minimal character set in maybe 12-20 hours.
    But that's not anything I would ship, either in terms of quality or character
    set completeness. Getting something polished and complete can easily run into
    months... or years. Hypatia Sans took five years for the upright and another three
    for the italics, though most of that was not full time. Slimbach spent some 15
    years on Garamond Premier, though also not full time.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    I have from the university so... is nothing to be honest. I want to create something
    good and I'm doing a lot of investigation about this subject and to be honest
    I'm getting really excited! I would like to show you the font when I finish it,
    just to have your honest opinions.\r\n\r\nBy the way I'm not sure which one is
    the most impressive: if the guy who took 2 hours to design an entire font family
    or Slimbach who took 15 years..."
