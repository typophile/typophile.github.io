  Estonia!\r\n\r\nI'm desperately trying to identify a couple of fonts here.. which
  brings me to you :P\r\n\r\nthis one:\r\nhttp://www.householdtextiles.com/cmpts/general/title.gif\r\n\r\nand
  this one:\r\nhttp://www.householdtextiles.com/cmpts/general/newcat_title.gif\r\n\r\nAny
  guesses would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd be really thankful if anybody
  could suggest a lookalike for Palace Script by Monotype.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Serif</a> and <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?font=myriad&q=Go">Myriad</a>
    (it doesn't look like the condensed version more like manually squooshed). And
    why don't you just take <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=palace+script&q=Go">Palace
    Script</a>?

      Myriad Condensed / squashed.. just wanted to be sure :)\r\nPalace Script is
      unfortunately out-of-budget (sorry, forgot to mention I'm looking for a free
      lookalike) as it's a personal project.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the quick response!"

    in common is that they are sanbs serif. '
