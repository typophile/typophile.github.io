body: "hello.\r\nmy name is yaron and im a second year visual communications student
  from israel.\r\n\r\ni wanted to share a project i did for our illustration class.\r\n\r\ni
  created an illustration book (called \"Red Fur\") inspired by illuminated medieval
  books and later printed german books. i needed to make a logo that matches the theme,
  so i developed some \"hebrew blackletter\" letters using a font that i love called
  -  \"willhelm klingspor gotisch\".\r\n\r\nthe title says \"Parva (fur) Aduma (red)\"\r\n\r\nyou
  can view the illustrations and some initials i designed in this set:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/yaronimus/sets/72057594064500349/\r\n\r\ni'll
  post some initials soon."

  body: "Like I mentioned on Flickr, I *love* your first graphic. \r\n\r\nYour second
    graphic feels to close to the Latin alphabet for me, though (not that I can read
    Hebrew\u2026). It looks like \"qio\", with the dot on the i falling over. Normally,
    I don't  think that I would \"read\" English (or whatever) into Hebrew, but since
    you are using such an iconic Latin design, it is too hard to avoid."

  body: "thanks man - yea you'r right - it does look like qio.\r\ni remember on logo
    (and several more) that was so lousy that hebrew reading people thought it was
    english. usualy it happens when the designer is a novice and when people use english
    fonts parts in order to build a hebrew font. "

    fonts are critically needed.\r\nIf you make this into a font, it will be only
    the second of its kind.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
