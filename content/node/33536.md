  there,\r\nI'm redesigning a well known album at the moment. I was wondering how
  you would go about kerning a quotation intended to be placed at the centre of a
  page. As the attatchment shows I am using Gill Sans MT throughout the booklet and
  therefore using it for the quotation. I am considering using a typeface with pre-set
  ligatures, but for the moment I wondered if anyone could suggest how best to kern
  this piece of type. I would be very greatful for any feedback and continue posting
  the remainder of the booklet at a later date after feedback.\r\n\r\nThe second image
  is just one of the images =I am using for the final booklet made from over 400 lit
  tealight candles.\r\n\r\nCheers again. "

    quotation is as follows in 30pt Gill Sans MT stretching across three CD page flaps\r\n:\r\n'The
    butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.'\r\n"

  body: "Try the FAQs for image posting, this is too wide to see the whole quote in
    one go and thus tricky to judge the kerning. My first advice is to work on the
    kerning in rfl in butterfly, this might involve redrawing parts of the f so the
    r doesn\u2019t meet the crossbar. Try the print out and squint method to pick
    out any particularly dark or light patches and fix them.\r\nFor the \u201CTo Dee\u2026\u201D
    section you might try an uppercase E on ella and work on the turnovers to get
    \u201CWe love you.\u201D all on one line, then you could look at overhanging punctuation.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\nbtw
