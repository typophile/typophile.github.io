  I worked for produced between 1963 and 1980. It definitely looks like it was done
  in the mid to late 60s, and I'm guessing it was done with phototypesetting.\r\n\r\nI'm
  wondering if the fact that the main typefaces it uses are Alternate Gothic and Eurostile
  Bold would help narrowing down the timeframe it was produced.\r\n\r\nI know Eurostile
  was designed in 1962, but perhaps if it wasn't available as prototype until later,
  that might help me narrow things down.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJonathan\r\n"

  body: You may date the brochure no earlier than a certain date from the typeface
    used, but that's about it. The only other easily-seen factor that could date your
    brochure to earlier than late 1963 would be if the address doesn't use a ZIP code.
