  body: Thet text face looks like plain ole <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/arial/mt-light/testdrive.html?s=MARSHY%20AND%20DANGEROUS&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank"> Arial</a> &#40;can&#39;t really make out  <BR>the tail on the
    &#34;R&#34; nor the spur on the &#34;G&#34;&#41; while &#34;Pendol Pond&#34;  <BR>is
    quite similar to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-gothic/engravers-gothic/testdrive.html?s=PENDOL%20POND&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank"> Engravers Gothic</a>/<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/sackers-gothic/light/testdrive.html?s=PENDOL%20POND&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Sackers Gothic</a>.

  body: I don&#39;t think the text is Arial, the tail on the R is wrong, as is the
    E. More like Trade or News Gothic, although the S is wrong for both those fonts.
    <BR> <BR>The people who make this sort of sign don&#39;t necessarily use the same
    digitized fonts that are readily available for the computer.

  body: Trade Gothic or News Gothic have a very different &#34;skeleton&#34; so I  <BR>guess
    that rules them out. This is a clear Helvetica-model grotesk. <BR> <BR>The other
    possibility I had in mind &#40;if the leg on the &#34;R&#34; proves to  <BR>be
    straight and the &#34;G&#34; has a spur&#41; is <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=AB89001001P1"
    target="_blank"> Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk</a>  <BR>or a similar face, but the
    middle bar on the &#34;E&#34; is too short and  <BR>the &#34;S&#34; is closed
    more in the sample

  body: Signs like this are made with sign-making systems such as the Leroy Lettering
    System. The &#34;fonts&#34; are templates which are traced with a pantograph and
    an engraving or routing tool. The lettering styles made for such systems are similar
    to existing typefaces, but not the same. It&#39;s a kind of parallel universe
    to the world of typography.
