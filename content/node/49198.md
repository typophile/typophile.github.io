  a 1923 ATF Book of Type Styles from 1923, among the piles of old letterpress letters
  I was scooping up.\r\n\r\nThe dealer wanted $325, but I got him to hold it for me
  for $250. \r\n\r\nI'm a graphic designer that adores type - but I don't know a lot
  about how much something like this is even worth. I did some Typophile searches,
  figuring this question has probably come up before... I found a post saying you
  can usually buy these for $120-$150. The quality of the book is fair - has the crusty,
  musty smell and look of a worn, old treasure. I snapped a few pics that are with
  this post.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is - should I just be happy I stumbled upon one
  of these and buy it asap? Or try to bargain this guy down further? Thanks in advance
  for any advice, typophiles! \r\n\r\n-Anne\r\n\r\nAside:\r\nSomething about this
  book jogged my memory. I went home to my beloved dorky design binders and found
  an article I'd pulled out of Print \"If I had $9,000...\" The article was a collection
  of things a designer might buy if they just happened to have a suitcase of money
  under the bed. One of the items was this book! Ha!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_1301_6574.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_1304_6144.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_1303_3881.jpg]"

    be found in the hands of better businesses cheap, tho, and right now there are

  body: "Anne,\r\n\r\nIt's a lovely speciemen book indeed, and of course one of the
    standard books for a serious type designer or a graphic designer with a great
    deal of interest for typography. Usually the \"mid-20ies\" editions are the best
    from most type foundries. Still judging from the pictures it seems to be pretty
    warn and jagged. I wouldn't pay more that $100 or so for this particular piece.
    E-bay often have this book in mint condition."

    responses. \r\n\r\nJudging by a couple of the responses, I probably didn't make
    myself super-clear... I haven't bought the book - yet. I was looking for the sage
    advice of all the typophiles out there to be better armed with info on what I
    should (and shouldn't) be spending for this particular copy. I'll go back to the
    dealer and see what kind of deal we can strike. I'd like to try, anyway - as I
    could use the practice negotiating. I'm terrible at negotiating, I usually just
    pay what they're asking.\r\n\r\nIf I scoop it up, I'll be sure to post pictures!\r\n\r\nThanks
    again, everyone!"

    cheaply on eBay if you are willing to wait. I'd say that if you bid $120 for one
    of these on eBay you will win and for a lot less.\r\n\r\nThese were published
    in a very massive edition back in 1923. Theo Rehak, in his book on ATF, mentions
    how foundry workers, a half century or more later, were using mint copies for
    firewood at one point.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "Hi Anne.\r\n\r\nThe advice to go bidding on ebay is really valid. This copy
    you're looking at in the antiquey-junky-funky place is overpriced by about 200%.
    \r\n\r\nI say this because I asked my local bookseller (in New Zealand) to acquire
    me one a couple of years ago \u2013 and including the shipping & insurance, it
    still came in at less than half the price of this one you're getting held at $250.
    I know I paid over the odds, but my copy is in better condition. \r\n\r\nThe book
    itself states that the 1923 edition was 60,000 copies. They were passed out to
    ATF resellers worldwide. Here's a couple of pages with that 'old flavour'...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ATF_Garamond4_4452.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ATF_Recut-Caslon1_5702.jpg]"

  body: This is a nice book if it is in one piece still. Check to see if any ofthe
    pages have been removed or if someone has been at the pages with a scalpel. If
    its all there then $150 is a fair price, if it been hacked about then don't pay
    over $100.
