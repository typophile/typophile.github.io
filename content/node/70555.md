  you double-click on OTF file that's just been generated, for some reason, e.g. space
  between 7 and 8 is much wider/bigger then in VFB file.\r\n\r\nThen I install the
  font and test it in Illustrator with typing 78 and it's showing normal - as it should
  be, with proper metrics/kerning.\r\n\r\nThen, again, I go back and open VFB file
  and type 78 just to be sure again it's correct and it is.\r\n\r\nSo, problem is
  only visible in Windows' preview on double-click.\r\n\r\n- - - -\r\n\r\nIs it a
  problem in hinting (but it's too much space between the characters to be hinting
  problems?)?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know why is this happening?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n- Dusan"
