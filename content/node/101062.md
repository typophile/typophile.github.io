body: The monospaced one is used in James May's book 'How to land an A330 Airbus',
  and the grotesque one is from a 70's NASA technical report. Any pointers will be
  highly appreciated. Thanks.

    to <strong>[[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ProFontWindows|ProFontWindows]]</strong>

    very close to <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=ITC&ffam=ITC%20Franklin%20Gothic%20Book%20-%20Regular&fid=f0fa0fd2fd18567fc887a33456871365&fsize=48&text=SIMPLIFIED%20CONTROL%20AND%20FLIGHT%20MANAGEMENT%20FOR%20THE%201980's&wrap=2|ITC

  body: "Thanks for the prompt replies. \r\n\r\nLeroy was a good pointer. I will pursue
    it further. Lineto's Gravur Condensed comes close as well. \r\n\r\nIncidentally
    the monospace is also a Lineto creation called [[http://lineto.com/1.0/cont_des_37.html|Autoscape]].
    I had seen it in use in a degree project, and I managed to track down the guy,
    who then passed on the name to me. There is an obvious connection to ProFont like
    you mentioned."
