  body: "Thanks Jean, but I also think that font is not Richard Miller... have a look
    at the 'K' in the image I am posting below.\r\n\r\nJan, IVI? Would there be a
    link to this typeface? It's a new one for me.\r\n\r\nI am also posting a closer
    image of the mysterious 'M'.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/detail_13_2_6488.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/detail_13_3_5426.jpg]"

    I, kerned very tightly to look like an M.'

  body: "Cristobal, thank you for explaining Jan's comment. It does make sense! And
    the 'K' would be a 'I' with a '<' also kerned very tight... ok got it! \r\n\r\nBut
    which typeface is that anyways? Anyone?\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
