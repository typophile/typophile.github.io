<p>In reviewing the unit arrangements for a few of the well-known typefaces, I found out that in Poliphilus, the capital letter W was 21 units wide, which is more than 18 units. In fact, looking at the unit arrangements document, I see that several other typefaces go over 18 units; several have characters that are 20 units wide, and a few go up to 25, 28, or even 29 units.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">If you&rsquo;re asking how this is possible or how it is implemented, it&rsquo;s necessary to type a &ldquo;high space&rdquo; before these characters, because they obviously kern off the lefthand edge of the type body.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for the answer; this is my question: how characters above 18 units were handled.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised, though, that this was done so&hellip; routinely. I would have thought that the characters would have been scaled to fit 18 units (not by changing their general size - a higher set would be used) so as to avoid anything as cumbersome as that. Even several sizes of Caslon Old Face, I&rsquo;ve found, had this property.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re very welcome. I learned this working on a Monotype caster this past summer. They also have two different keys for a, e, and o: one set sets the letters with a negative left kern, for using after T, V, etc. A lot to remember. So to type &ldquo;Wa&rdquo;, you had to type a high space, then W, and then remember to use the alternate &ldquo;a&rdquo; key. But yes, it is strange that you need to use a high space so frequently. I think the reason they couldn&rsquo;t just make the character bodies wider is that the lead would take too long to cool and mess up the caster somehow. This is why I was told that you can&rsquo;t type em/em/em/em etc to fill out a blank line. You need to type en/en/en/en because having too many wide characters in a row causes problems as the metal cools.</p>
