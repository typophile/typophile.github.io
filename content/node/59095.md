body: "Dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm building a new sans in FontLab and tried this and
  that and didn't save each time I changed something. So I deleted some glyphs which
  I decided I won't need in this early status. \r\n\r\nBut what bugs me is that as
  far as I know it's not possible to make a deleted glyph look like the ones I didn't
  touch at all (light grey with a dark grey version of what the glyph possibly looks
  like). I know I can generate a glyph with nothing in it but this leaves a white
  place in the font window just like I deleted everything in the glyph window. \r\n\r\nCan
  I reset the look of a glyph in the font window to default?\r\n\r\nI hope this is
  not too confusing. Thanks in advance.\r\n"

  body: If your glyph is part of the codepage (you can tell by it's name in a yellow
    bar) you can delete the glyph and it will go grey. If it's not in the codepage
    it will be deleted.
