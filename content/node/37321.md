  connection between them. (This paper will later be used as copy for a book I design.)
  I chose Jan Tschichold and Paul Renner. I'm going to cover the basics of their careers,
  but I thought it would be interesting to the focus on Tschichold's rejection of
  modernism, and Renner's attempt to set a middle course between Tschichold's conservatism
  and Max Bill's attacks on Tschichold.\r\n\r\nI'm not very knowledgable about typography,
  and I'm worried this will end up being less about typography and more about graphic
  design. Does anyone have any advice? Is my scope too narrow? Are there any other
  connections between Tschichold and Renner that would be good to consider?\r\n\r\nI'd
  just like some advice about direction. Thanks."

    so much reject modernism as give up on the dogmatic side of modernism, the notion
    that modernism was superior, and that everything else needed to be pushed aside.
    This was a combination of his experiences with Nazi dogma and a pragmatic decision\u2014if
    he wanted to survive by designing books sticking to modernism was pretty much
    out of the question. I think that people have a tendency to pick up on the mordant
    nature of the open letters Tschichold and Bill were writing and apply Tschichold\u2019s
    feelings toward Bill to Modernism.\r\n\r\n<cite>...less about typography and more
    about graphic design...</cite>\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019re not mutually
    exclusive subjects, especially when Tschichold is being discussed.\r\n\r\n<cite>Is

    The 1946 article \u2018On Typography\u2019 by Max Bill (\u201CTypography is the
    design of of text-images, in the same way that modern, concrete painting is the
    design of rhythms of space.\u201D), Tschichold\u2019s rather condescending response
    \u2018Belief and Reality\u2019 (\"Obeying good rules of composition and book design
    in the manner of traditional typography is not \u2018putting the clock back\u2019;
    but an eccentric style of setting is almost always debatable. Thus, the layout
    of Bill\u2019s article is exciting because unusual, but is not to be taken as
    a model for general imitation.\u201D) and Renner\u2019s article \u2018On Modern
    Typography\u2019 2 years later (\u201CThe Bauhaus style is, as Jugendstil and
    the arts & crafts of the Wiener Werkst\xE4tte once were, a station on the way
    to the style of our time. One should not linger too long at these stations if
    one does not want to miss the connection.\u201D) are all reproduced with an introduction
    by Christopher Burke and Robin Kinross."

    Literature</em>]]. Given how great his Renner book is, I''m really looking forward
    to reading this one, as Tschichold is, I believe, a more pervasive influence.
    Between Burke''s two books you should have a lot of information. '
