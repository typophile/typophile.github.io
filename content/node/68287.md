body: "I am currently doing a logo for Italian restaurant, pizzeria and spaghetteria.
  Name for restaurant is Bruschetta, located in Zadar, Croatia.\r\n\r\nClient even
  before brief wanted Kunstler script to use as main typography but I think it is
  not so appropriate for an Italian restaurant.\r\nI need alternative for script if
  client doesn't want to use serifed typeface.\r\n\r\nSo I am looking for a script
  that has organic feel, that has connection with food, vegetables, ingredients. And
  also convey italian and mediterranean feel.     \r\n\r\nThought of pairing Bodoni
  and Bodoni script but I am not sure for now.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe something like this.\r\n\r\nThanks
  everyone.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo_Dine_Italia_2009_4044.jpg]"
