    but from SummitSoft Corp., a very well-known untrusted source for original design.
    Designed by [[http://hardyseiler.de|Hardy Seiler]] for [[http://www.mintcollective.de|MINT
    Collective]], it is somehow similar to [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/flower|Flower]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/albertus|Albertus]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/quorum|Quorum]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/dragon|Dragon]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/memo|Memo]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/amerigo|Amerigo]]. A [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/copperplate|Copperplate]]
    would work also nicely as base font ([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/copperplate-classic|Copperplate
    Classic]] for instance).\r\nYou may also be interested in [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tautz|Tautz]]."
