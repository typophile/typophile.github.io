body: "I was typing out a heading in Albertus (Albertus Std Regular, the Monotype
  Opentype file) but with the V I noticed something odd. I zoomed in and saw the right
  serif has a sort of slope to it. When on the Light and Italic of the same family,
  it is not sloped.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Bitstream Flareserif 821 has not got
  this slope either.\r\n\r\nIs this a defect in the file, and should I go back to
  the distributor or is it a quirk that's been there for a while? Is it only this
  newer Opentype one that has this or was it on the older files too?"

  body: "It appears to be a quirk that's been there for a long time. At least since
    a file internally dated 1991 as published by Adobe in 1995. Fontlab shows a 3
    unit drop from left to right, from 750 to 747. It is not in versions created by
    other companies or in other weights or variants.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: "What other company versions are there, apart from Bitstream version? Most
    I see are just the Monotype one, which seems just like the Adobe one (the myFonts
    sample can show the quirk, which doesn't show in the character dump).\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I recall seeing somewhere a crossed W in something set in Albertus. Is this an
    old alternate character or was it probably custom made?"
