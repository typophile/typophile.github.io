  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m hoping someone can shed some light.</p>
<p>I notice that for a lot of (most?) sans-serif fonts, the letter i is as minimal as could be. Simply a stick and a dot. The L is similarly minimal, just a stick, or in the luckier cases, perhaps a kink at the top or a curve at the bottom.</p>
<p>I find that this hinders readability – or at least it does for me. Just now I was reading a page set in Verdana, and could not figure out if the word &ldquo;ability&rdquo; was spelled correctly. The i&rsquo;s and l&rsquo;s simply fused, and I could not tell whether there were 3 or 4 &ldquo;sticks&rdquo;. I had to get closer to the screen.</p>
<p>Do others have similar trouble with these letters?
Some sans-serifs that make the i&rsquo;s and l&rsquo;s more recognizable: ITC Officina Sans, Monitor Pro, Fira Sans, Ubuntu, Trebuchet.</p>
<p>To me these look every bit as good as Clear Sans, Source Sans, Helvetica. Better, in fact, since I seem to parse them more easily.</p>
<p>Why are &ldquo;skinny&rdquo; l&rsquo;s and i&rsquo;s so popular? Purely historic/evolution considerations? Or perhaps to make lines of text fit more letters?
And is there any word to distinguish fonts with skinny i&rsquo;s from those with more serif-like i&rsquo;s?
Also, I&rsquo;ve seen some mentions of the dots: square, round, diamond etc. Does that make a difference?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some sans typefaces do include serifs on some letters but it also adds to the texture. If you want to keep it neutral you have to keep the letter forms minimal. Verdana had to be minimal due to restrictions in rendering technology, but as render technology improves I suspect there will also be an increase in the texture of typefaces.</p>
<p>Also, I notice I particularly have the problem of /ili blending together when I&rsquo;m wearing only one contact lens or I need my contact lenses corrected. Is it not also just an issue of degrading eyesight? I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s a problem that needs to be addressed necessarily.</p>

True, but still, many people have degrading eyesight, so I guess there&rsquo;s a market.</p>
<p>I just saw Spiekermann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Helvetica Sucks&rdquo; image. Apparently we&rsquo;re not the only ones having issues with i&rsquo;s and ells.</p>

<p>Regarding degraded eyesight, this is a legitimate issue for publications aimed at an older audience. If I&rsquo;m preparing something for seniors I&rsquo;ll increase the type size. And of course there are &ldquo;large type&rdquo; editions of some publications. It&rsquo;s not practical to put everything in large type as it looks clunky and wastes paper, but using computers or eReaders (iPad, Kindle, etc) can help as the type can usually be enlarged easily.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I understand degrading eyesight is an issue. Obviously your typeface needs to be optimized and you need to set the type at a certain size so people above a certain age can read the typeface easily and comfortably as well. But again, I don&rsquo;t feel like the problem with reading &lsquo;ili&rsquo; needs to be addressed necessarily. When you read complete sentences it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you read &lsquo;ili&rsquo; or &lsquo;illi&rsquo;. I do sometimes specifically look at this part to know how to type a certain word or name if I didn&rsquo;t already, but in general reading it doesn&rsquo;t come up as an issue.</p>
<p>However, to address the issue there are a few tricks but they all have certain consequences. One might place the tittles higher, make rounded tittles instead of square ones, make the tittles larger than usually, make the top of the stem thicker or add a slab serif to /i and maybe give the /l a tail so there&rsquo;s a bit more distance between l_i. Erik Spiekermann likes to give i/j a slab serif and give the /l a tail. It adds quite a lot of texture and a more varied rhythm though, so it&rsquo;s not always preferable. When the appearance of your typeface changes so drastically it could seriously undermine your design. Hence I don&rsquo;t see it as an issue which should be addressed necessarily.</p>
<blockquote>I thought this would be the majority position, but just the other day I was reading a complaint against Fira for having excessively prominent tittles. Go figure!</blockquote>
Aren't tittles always bigger than stems? With squared tittles they tend to be the same width as the stem, but even there in some typefaces it's slightly wider. When it comes to rounded tittles my understanding was that they always need to be bigger than the stem so they look optically just right. Or would you like to see the tittles slightly bigger than what is optically correct?
<p>I tend to make tittles a bit too big when I want the typeface to look a bit more friendly and playful. In case of Fira Sans the tittle is probably a big bigger to improve legibility. At small sizes the tittle and stem tend to melt together, so you need to make the tittle bigger and/or place it higher or add a slab serif to have a proper barrier between the tittle and the stem. I think when considering tittle size you also need to think about its application. Fira Sans will work great at text size, but at the size it&rsquo;s displayed in the pictures I feel the tittle is indeed a bit too big. I understand the criticism, but I think in this case people might be valuing its appearance more than its functionality while I suspect Spiekermann made the tittles bigger not because of the appearance in style but the increase in legibility at smaller sizes.</p>

A possible <em>reason</em> for objecting to a typeface like Fira Sans is that from a suitable distance, the enlarged dots on the i and j will stand out from the texture of the page - it will now look like a grey text area with black dots peppered through it.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not convinced that uniform texture is needed for readability. Enlarged dots may, by standing out, add an extra dimension to the &ldquo;bouma&rdquo; of words, which is a good thing for ease of reading.

It doesn't improve readability. It improves legibility. Body text needs to be more consistent, so you will find an /l with a tail mostly in typefaces that are suitable for display use.
<blockquote>And, pardon for saying this, my professional deformation as a coder is speaking here, but: I can't understand why you'd make readers's heads and eyes work any harder than necessary.</blockquote>
I'm not. You don't need to be able to see the difference between 'ili' and 'illi' in words because you recognize whole words rather than that you read each letter individually. By making every letter more distinct you improve the legibility but in some areas it has consequences for the readability.
<p>I would add a slab serif to i/j to some typefaces if I want to achieve a certain texture, but not by default. It improved legibility but it&rsquo;s not consistent. It becomes more consistent by designing other letters to be more distinct as well, such as adding a tail to /l. If you do this, you might give a/d/h/m/n/u spurs as well, and with so many horizontals added you can see why it adds texture. This isn&rsquo;t always wanted and in fact many sans typefaces are designed to be neutral and calm.</p>
<p>Also, geometric typefaces are generally meant to be minimalist and they take the proportions to extremes, where condensed letters like f/i/j/l/t are really condensed. Just have a look at Futura.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from Reading Letters:
The dots on the &lsquo;i&rsquo; and &lsquo;j&rsquo; are in danger of visually connecting with the stem and being perceived as ascending characters. This risk is more evident in sans serif than in serif typefaces. Although not approved of by some designers—who argue that serifs do not belong on a sans serif typeface—several newer sans serif typefaces have a slab serif on &lsquo;i&rsquo; and &lsquo;j&rsquo;. The phenomenon is most common in typefaces designed for electronic media and signage, where optimal character recognition is thought to be essential, and where spacing is less subtle. The slab serif on &lsquo;i&rsquo; and &lsquo;j&rsquo; is often found in the sans serif faces by Erik Spiekermann, who further shows a liking for the sans serif &lsquo;l&rsquo; with a tail to the right.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, some of these tricks don&rsquo;t necessarily improve legibility either, as I also found out by typing that paragraph. I thought it said &ldquo;who further shows a liking for the sans serif &rsquo;t' with a tail to the right.&rdquo; The lighting is not great here and I looked at it for at least 5 seconds before I decided it has to be an &lsquo;l&rsquo; because a &rsquo;t' has a tail almost by default. When the /t is wider it improves legibility, but when it&rsquo;s too wide it can be easily confused with /c.</p>
<p>Look at the studies that have been done by Sanford (distance test &amp; short exposure test, 1888), Dockeray (parafoveal vision test, 1910), Tinker (short exposure test, 1928), Bouma (distance test &amp; short exposure test, 1971) and Geyer (short exposure test, 1977) to look at all the letters that are commonly misread given the use of specific typefaces.</p>
<p>Studies have also been done to get insight into which parts of the letters we look at for recognition, and apparently when it comes to /l we predominantly look at the upper part. So it seems the tail on /l is to make the letter more distinct by giving it wider side bearings and having the tail compensate for the extra space than it is about making the design of the letter itself more distinct.</p>

<p>In fact, I think that reading is <em>mostly</em> letterwise decipherment, but it runs more smoothly and more quickly because of assists from such factors as the redundancy of the language as well as word boumas. Redundancy,  unlike bouma, is not a visual element, but it allows predictive decoding - reading is quicker when people are being largely presented with what they expect to see.</p>

<p>There are limits to the available methods in experimental psychology, since there is no direct access to the brain&rsquo;s inner workings.</p>
<p>If the eye doesn&rsquo;t rest on some of the letters long enough for letterwise decoding to take place for them, then what is filling in the gap? Is it word and sentence completion inferred from the letters that were decoded - probably, to some extent. But how much help is that receiving from word shapes? <em>How can you tell?</em></p>
<p>One method that I suppose could be tried, although still somewhat &ldquo;invasive&rdquo;, would be to use one of those display typefaces where the x-height occupies the full body size (I couldn&rsquo;t quickly find the example I was thinking of, but Parity by Shinn Type is one in this category - ah, further searching turned up a thread here, mentioning Alphabet 26 and noting that the general term is &ldquo;unicase&rdquo;; Fervent Sans from Creative Market is another example&hellip; ah, it may have been the alternates from Folio that I remembered), essentially eliminating bouma, and see how badly it interfered with reading.</p>
<p>Measuring blink rates instead of just reading speed - as was discussed here a while back - is an important way to measure readability instead of just legibility, the latter being so much easier to measure that often it gets to be the only thing measured.</p>

<p>Folks with significant macular degeneration (deterioration of the central portion of the eye) have great trouble reading, even with magnification. I&rsquo;ve known several elderly folks with this disorder and eventually they can&rsquo;t even recognize people. So I&rsquo;m skeptical that much recognition of letters takes place outside the center of the eye.</p>

<p>The eye rests long enough (not on letters, but on the entire visual field) simply to be <em>sufficiently</em> certain of having extracted <em>enough</em> data; a regression happen when it has been too &ldquo;impatient&rdquo;. The uncertainty of letter clusters in the parafovea is just part of the risk-taking. Over time, experience with reading greatly refines this subconscious art of risk-taking.</p>
<p>How can I tell? I can&rsquo;t. I can only think, and realize that Larson&rsquo;s testing is fatally flawed, and his conclusions provincial. For example, he has already exceeded any potential conclusions from your proposed unicase experiment and claimed that all-UC text is actually just as readable as mixed-case.</p>
<p>James, I don&rsquo;t see how the experience of people with failing eyesight means only the fovea is used.</p>

It&rsquo;s not a misconception. However, I didn&rsquo;t want to imply you only read words, either. Both principles are at play here, but an experienced reader reads a lot of full words rather than individual letters because a lot of word shapes are stored in your memory, just like letter shapes are. Last week I read a very interesting study on dyslexia which gave insight into this as well. The book Reading Letters also has interesting information on this.</div>

So trying to read something in the parafovea without the benefit of the preceding text is probably indeed hopeless. It would be interesting to run experiments which somehow deliver the text preceding the foveal text. Ideally on test subjects born with a defective fovea.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another factor, one that&rsquo;s very hard to quantify: our subconscious can do things our consciousness cannot. I think it&rsquo;s certainly possible, and arguably probable that when we try to consciously –hence necessarily letterwise– decipher parafoveal text, we &ldquo;try too hard&rdquo; and miss the forest for the trees so to speak.</p>
