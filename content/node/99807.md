  I can't figure out myself.\r\n\r\nI'm talking about the 'CHANNEL' subline beneath
  the prominent 'Z'\u2026\r\n\r\nAny ideas regarding the classic zeeeh-channel? ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers"

      fit\u2026 I'll give your other suggestions a shot. \r\n\r\nThanks :-) "

  body: "Thanks man, you helped me a lot! \r\n\r\nI tried Helvetica Inserat and Helvetica
    Condensed Black and it's going to be one of those two. Not sure yet which one
    to choose, both look alright and I guess an untrained eye couldn't spot the difference
    :-)"

  body: "Agree. And if you add some vintage/screen/TV post-treatment, that should
    do the job.\r\nFor the second one, that would probably easier to entirely redraw/trace
    it as it's \"only\" straight lines. Start with a square shape to keep proportions,
    duplicate on purpose to recreate each letters and finally cut /C and /A external
    angles."
