body: This is from the actual movie poster. I just singled it out so it would be an
  easier read. I understand that someone might have "stenciled" an existing serif
  just for this poster. I would venture to say that this is some sort of phototype.
  The date on the poster is 1987.

    No legitimate source. No information on a heavier weight, or compressed versions.\r\nDon"

    find similar information and turned up totally blank.\r\n\r\nRyuk: Tea Chest is
    pretty similar.\r\n\r\nI just now noticed that this stencil has some [[http://www.identifont.com/show?39OE|Belwe]]-like
    traits. The 'G' sets it apart from a lot of serifs."

  body: "I should mention that with the exception of the \"drainpipe\" curved foot
    on _G_, the unusual leg on _R_, the top lhs serif on _A_, and the bottom rhs serif
    on _N_ and _V_  the design of base letters is derived from a conventional typeface.
    \r\nA word about terminology. An \"Egyptian\" or \"Egyptienne\" typeface is a
    Roman typefaces with slab (or square or rectangular) shaped serifs. Typefaces
    that have bracketing between main strokes and serifs are known as \"Clarendon-style
    Egyptians.\"\r\nGOOD MORNING VIETNAM is a Clarendon-style Egyptian. See for example
    Egyptienne Bold Condensed by Linotype [img:sites/default/files/old-images/EgyptienneBoldCondensed_5207.jpg]\r\nThe
    width, horizontal contrast and serif length are similar but the the horizontal
    strokes are too heavy and the serif thickness is about twice that in GOOD MORNING
    VIETNAM.\r\nDon"
