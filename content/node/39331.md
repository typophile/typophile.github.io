  body: "GENERAL DISCLAIMER: If it ain't an Adobe font, it may break your license
    for the font. You'll have to check.\r\n\r\nIf the final font is to be an OpenType
    font, you are going to have to write features. So the first questions is, do you
    want to save the kerning in the original Type 1 small cap font. It will be flat
    pairs kerning, not class-based kerning.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to save that
    kerning, just cut & paste the small cap glyphs into the \"main\" font file, and
    rename them. The usual convention is to name them \"A.smcp\" and use no Unicode
    number. To make them accessible, you need to write a couple features -- if you
    are using FontLab, see the FontLab examples.\r\n\r\nIf you do want to save the
    kerning in the original small cap font, I'd rename the glyphs in that font (again,
    \"A.smcp\" etc.) and write off an .afm file with the renamed glyphs. Now cut &
    paste the glyphs as above, and write off an .afm file for the new font file that
    now contains the A.smcp etc.\r\n\r\nUsing \"grep\" (or the Mac equivalent) extract
    \"smcp\" from the original .afm file to another file (e.g. grep \"smcp\" smallcap.afm
    > smcaps). Open up that file & delete all lines except the KPX lines. Add the
    KPX lines to you new afm (after the other KPX lines works fine), save, & read
    that afm back into the font. Now you have your pairs kerning with the added small
    capitals.\r\n\r\nA lot of work, isn't it? You can write some little programs to
    ease the manual work, but I don't know of any generally available. I use old TeX
    tools, but maybe there are some Python scripts out there.\r\n\r\nBTW, the problem
    with just merging the fonts in FontLab is the kerning. You have to leave the full
    caps and punctuation in the font you are merging in order to preserve the kerning.
    That means when you merge, you double them up in the resulting font. FontLab will
    give these \"doubled glyphs\" a unique name (something like like A.1), but the
    small cap kerning for those \"doubled letters\" is now with that unique name.\r\n\r\nPlay
    around a bit, you might hit on something faster.\r\n\r\nBTW-2: If your time is
    worth anything, it will be cheaper just to buy new OT versions of the fonts."

    think Eduardo wants to convert *his own* fonts, since he happens to have his own
    foundry http://www.tipo.net.ar/sobre_eng.html\r\n\r\nEduardo, I'd encourage you
    to use the [[AFDKO]]. There are several threads around here about how to use it."
