  family, now in [[OpenType]], was designed by [[Nick Shinn]]. [[Contextual alternates]]
  make Handsome have the random flavor of real writing. The weights have been named
  after writing devices like \u201CFineliner\u201D and \u201CSpeedball\" instead of
  the traditional Light, Regular, Bold approach bringing fun to a casual family of
  fonts.\r\n\r\nURL: http://shinntype.com/Handsome_frames/C_han.html"
