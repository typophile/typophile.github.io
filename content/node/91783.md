  body: "Your subject asks \"Look familiar?\" - I first thought it was a request for
    a font ID.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed immediately was that the A, H, X,
    and f have some contours in the wrong direction (or haven't been merged), as exhibited
    by the white areas in the pdf image where there are overlaps.\r\n\r\nOther than
    that, I'm not qualified to comment!\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n\r\n"
