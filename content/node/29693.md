  use a little help, like examples of good grids and layouts...\r\nI did golden section
  on the cd cover but I am not sure is it correct.\r\n\r\nSo I should start working
  on intersection of lines or so?\r\nPlease help. Thanks.\r\n\r\np.s it is 12 cm x
  12 cm (standard). \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cd-zlatni_5620.jpg]"

    album name at the top to allow for reading in racks, apart from that let fly.
    Or do you mean for track listing and other information?\r\nTim"

  body: "That Bobby Mcferrin cover certainly looks like a golden section grid in the
    background although the elements of type don't seem to bear much relation to the
    grid. From the samples you posted I thought you might enjoy this gallery of <a
    href=\"http://www.fedge.net/~desiderata/4ad20.html\">4AD covers</a>. My opinion
    is that the golden section doesn't fit in with the format of a cd cover too well
    and that you are probably best developing your own grid and creating a hierarchy
    for the information.\r\nTim"
