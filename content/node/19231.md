body: The National Library of Scotland has put online a wonderful virtual exhibition,
  <em><a href="http://www.nls.uk/broadsides/index.html">The Word on the Street,</a></em>
  devoted to broadside news posters. Both the content and typography of the many specimens
  present a fascinating view of nearly 300 years of social history.

    many reads or replies to this thread, but I found the site to be rich with image
    and type resources along with commentaries on many of the broadsides."
