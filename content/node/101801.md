  Paris Match. Identifont recognize the font of the text as \"Arnhem Tab Normal\"
  and WhatTheFont as \"Times Ten Roman\", so I am a bit confused. Thanks anyway for
  your help !\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trierweilertout_5564.png]"

  body: "I think the serif is Times Ten and the sans serif is <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100009&path=head\">Verlag</a>.\r\n\r\n[EDIT]\r\nOops,

  body: "Can't be 100% positive for the serif but that's really looks like Times New
    Roman... May be [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/times+ten|Times Ten]]?\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    now seeing Akira's id, you can blindly trust him, should be Times Ten."
