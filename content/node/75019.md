  body: 'i''m not feeling the ''hang loose'' hand signs. i know they are suppose to
    be hand signals for phones, but they come across a little awkward. could silhouettes
    of profile faces be an alternative to hands? imo, #2 kinda gives me that feel.
    just a thought. '

  body: "hi hola, thanks for your input. it's always very helpful to know, that we
    see things so differently. the truth is that my client likes the idea of the hands,
    so i wish to stick with it, even if i have to work on them more. also i did some
    research and found that noone is using this gesture among the competitors, and
    i like to do something new if possible. in fact my first choice is the last version.
    i wonder what others think about that.\r\ni'm glad i found this forum and looking
    forward to exchange some ideas in the future.\r\nthanks again!\r\n"
