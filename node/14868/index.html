<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>HI All,
Would like some feedback on a logo design I have submitted to Durham region Transit. Ideas on colour, typestyle, form and style used would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Reid</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Reid,
looks like a few topics got piled up in the Forum and your request for comments got overlooked. I'm replying so the thread gets some attention again.
My general comment on DRT logo... a little too busy for my taste.
I don't understand the shield motif and PLEASE don't use pseudo small caps EVER!

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Norbert. I thought it was a bit busy. The small caps thing is an old habit… left over from my days as a package designer, I guess. I'll try to rework it to make it simpler.

<div class=commentbody>Hmmm, can you clarify your choices for the teal and the grey? I'm not convinced yet that the combination is best for transit.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with Dana about the colors personally although I find that teal is more acceptable in the south than it is in the north. Just an observation. I would love to know Why you picked these colors.
It isn't small caps that Norbert has in his gunsights - it's pseudo small caps. Do you know the difference? If not, chime in & we will explain. Or seasrch on google.
I have soft spot for public transit. Can you tell us more about the project? What is the current logo like? What are you attempting to do with the new logo? What is it meant to mean? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi All,
The logo was for a contest that was being held in our area. I chose the symbol of a crest because I wanted the logo to look somewhat traditional and in an Art Deco style. It was to look like a captain's hat for an airline. I know this isn't for an airline, but at the same time I wanted the viewer to have a sense of comfort in travelling on the transit, hence the crest to show stability. The colors were picked mainly because I felt that blue and red with grey is overused for transit companies. I wanted something different, more contemporary and sophisticated looking.
Was I off the mark in this approach?

<div class=commentbody>Hi Again,
I just found out which logo they picked for the contest. Here's the link if you would like to see the winning entry.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the link on what they chose. I can't say I think too much of what they picked. It's way to squishy and it lacks conviction. Typical design by commitee stuff. Your design had the seed of a good design in it. Keep posting your stuff!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the encouraging words Eben. I knew it wasn't quite finished, something was lacking band I wanted some good feedback, which is what I got.
