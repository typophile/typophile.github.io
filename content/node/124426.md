  bottom left ending of the \"J\" seems to point downwards and resembles a wedge,\r\nThe
  bottom left of the \"5\" also seems to point downwards and also resembles a wedge.\r\n\r\nThis
  doesnt seem common.\r\n\r\nWould love to know the font."

  body: The ruffled edges are not the same from letter to letter:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ohs_5849.jpg]so
    I would suggest such small variations cannot be attributed to decisions made in
