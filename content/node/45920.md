  body: "Well, there are 1001+ fonts in this style at the moment as it is oh so hip,
    but have a look at [[http://www.typophile.com/node/42643|this list that Stephen
    Coles compiled]] - I am sure you'll find something you like.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,
    pretty certain that your mystery font started out as Gill Sans, before it got
    the 'non-format ' treatment."

  body: According to <a href="http://cookieface.com.ar/2008/04/08/el-nuevo-disco-de-babasonicos/">this
    website</a>, the cover illustration (the one on the righthand side, and also the
    background pattern) is by <a href="http://www.siscottstudio.com/">Si Scott</a>.
    Maybe he's also the one that customized the colorful lettering. (Which certainly
    does look like it could be the work of <a href="http://www.non-format.com/">Non-Format</a>.
    But I'm with Seb, too.)

  body: Investigating the CSS reveals it to be Helvetica Neue. However, since there
    is no such font installed on my machine, I'm baffled how I'm seeing it.

  body: "The stuff on the left is an image, and the headings on the right are SIFR
    so you won't need it installed.\r\n\r\n\"BABASONICOS MUCHO\" looks more customized
    than the links below it, which just look like basic Gill Sans Ultra with the counters
    knocked out, but I would say it's at least inspired by Gill Sans Ultra. The headings
    on the right look like straight Gill Sans Ultra.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
