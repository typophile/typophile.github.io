  body: I don't know, but it's not so good. Looks like NBC pay as much for fonts as
    they do for writers. Consider <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/changeling/">Changeling</a>
    or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_qtype_semi_extended_ot/">FF
