  for ligatures for the typical ffi ffl etc and also for er ar to ...letters that
  I normally join in my handwriting.\r\nHowever the font includes modern greek and
  polytonic greek...and I want to include some ligatures for a few joined letters
  in modern greek.\r\nFor instance how would I include the substitution for epsilon
  and iotatonos by glyph FB10 (which at this point is also named fb10)?\r\nI put in
  the opentype instructions initially using VOLT. When I opened the font in Fontlab
  there was also a feature called zz01 this basically includes all the same info as
  the liga feature which also appears. Is this extra feature needed for liga to work?\r\nfeature
  zz01 {\r\n # Latin\r\n language zz01 exclude_dflt;\r\n    sub a r by FB05;\r\n    sub
  e r by fb06;\r\n    sub f f i by ffi;\r\n    sub f f l by ffl;\r\n    sub f f by
  ff;\r\n    sub f i by fi;\r\n    sub f l by fl;\r\n    sub l l by fb07;\r\n    sub
  t h by fb08;\r\n    sub t o by fb09;\r\n    sub a y by fb0a;\r\n    sub t i by fb0b;\r\n
  \   sub a u by fb0c;\r\n    sub t y by fb0d;\r\n    sub o u by fb0e;\r\n} zz01;\r\n\r\nI
  have also tried to use class based kerning using the instructions with fontlab but
  when I create the font and try to test the kerning the only letters which kern are
  the initail ones used to set up the kerning group. Am I missing something in settings?
  Currently in my font there are 1922 kerning pairs, is this extreme?\r\n \r\nAny
  help in any of these areas would be very greatfully received.\r\nThanks\r\nNeil"

  body: "Neil, \r\n\r\n1.  I recommend adopting a proper glyph naming scheme rather
    than ad-hoc names like \"fb06\". Read more here: \r\nhttp://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=3065\r\n\r\n2.
    When FontLab decompiles an OpenType font with features created in VOLT, it sometimes
    needs to add the \"zzXX\". This does not mean these features are in the font.
    Due to the nature of the Adobe FDK for OpenType source notation (.fea) used in
    FontLab's OpenType panel, certain features cannot be directly expressed in the
    source notation as is. This is a limitation of the current version of the Adobe
    FDK for OpenType that is likely to be improved in the future. \r\n\r\nRelying
    on the OpenType feature notation decompiled by FontLab from an existing font is
    not recommended. The decompilation works in many cases, but it surely does not
    represent 100% preciseness. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Hi Adam,\r\nThanks for replying.\r\nCould you possibly direct me how to implement
    the liga feature for use with greek characters to be used with a greek layout
    keyboard( not a physical greek keyboard, but where you can change lanuages for
    your keyboard). I tried just adding the substitutions to the list already but
    it causes errors.\r\nAlso what am I doing wrong regrding class kerning.\r\nMany
    thanks again\r\nNeil"

  body: "hi,\r\ni am workng on a opentype font in fontlab and i was wondering if there
    was a way to have several differnt options for the same charachter within the
    same opentype feature. For example swashes if i wanted to replcae the glyph A
    with A.swsh i would type\r\n\r\nfeature swsh {sub A by A.swsh;}swsh  \r\n\r\nbut
    if i wanted to give another glyph ontion on the leter A within the same opentype
    feature is there another way to do it. What I want is to have several glyph applied
    on top of each other so that the text can give he impression of being randomy
    chosen.\r\n\r\nIf any one could help me with this i would be very greatful.\r\n\r\nMany
    Thanks \r\nNeil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
