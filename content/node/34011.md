  body: According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is finally creating their version of
    "Busorama Bold ITC" and being cloned as Boss SM, which appears to be in the same
    design of FontBank's Bullion & Southern Software's Brioche Display SSi/SSK, except
    that the font itself not only has the same original uppercase character set on
    the "uppercase" part, but the altered uppercase character set on the "lowercase"
    part has the letters A, B, E, K, Q, R, S, T and V appear in altered glyph forms
    and with another 17 glyphs staying the same as the original uppercase character
    set, plus more symbols and punctuation and international characters were added,
    joining numbers and some symbols/punctuation in that same typeface design.     The
    font itself is finally appearing on "MegaFont XXL 3.0" (for home users) and "infiniType
    4" (for designers), which were both being released in May 27, 2014.

  body: You can tell it's not Si Scott because the ornamentation looks tacked on,
    not drawn.
