body: "After a long (but very beautiful...)path I'm about to consider finished the
  first weight of Amarantino. But I want some feedback from the community of well
  in(formed) typeface and typography designers. \r\n\r\nAmarantino ExtraLight has
  been developed over a period of 10 months (January to October 2008) as a sans serif
  versatile family with clean visual presence. The family is still in development
  and it will be formed by 5 weights (ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Bold, ExtraBold)
  and italics designed to communicate confidence and authority. \r\n\r\nAs always,
  existing designs have often been the source of inspiration for the creations of
  new ones. Amarantino is no exception and similarities can be found in the Sebastian
  Lester Soho\u2122 typeface. My goal was not to copy but respect this source and
  turn my creation into something unique and with personal flavour.\r\n\r\nThe name
  Amarantino comes from the natural born from the city of Amarante in Portugal. The
  author is an Amarantino.\r\n\r\nAmarantino is suitable for a variety of applications
  including medical, finance, transport, culture and high tech industries.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advanced\r\nAnt\xF3nio Fonseca"

  body: Overall, I think this is great. The "s" is the one thing that really jumps
    out at me. The curves just don't feel quite right, maybe the bottom could be a
    bit heavier than the top and not be such a mirror. In the numbers, digits like
    5, 6, 8, 9, felt a bit more geometrically forced than the alphabet, which feels
    really well resolved. Other than that, none of the other characters bothered me,
    and felt very natural to the typeface.

    run together to form \"exlstlng deslgns\" etc.\r\n\r\nr (and t?) might be a little
    too narrow.\r\n\r\nSomething about these letters reminds me of those plastic lettering
    stencils you can run a pencil around."

  body: "The S and s seem to flat.\r\nThe stem that follows the point where the stem
    and curve join on the m, n, a, d, r, q, and g seem quite short (especially at
    the text sizes). I might suggest making those a bit deeper. Especially if you
    make bolder versions you'll find you'll have to compensate quite a lot more.\r\nThe
    P, R, M, N, and W seem a little wide.\r\n\r\nGo Portugal!"

  body: "This looks very nice and as an aspiring type designer I admire anyone who
    has the courage to post their designs here. \r\n\r\nI was told a long time ago
    by a man called Bernd M\xF6llenstadt that you should design the bold version of
    your face first or at least draw some bold characters early on in the design process.\r\n\r\nYour
    design \u2013 which looks very fresh and clean\u2013 seems completely monoline.
    What will happen when the weight increases and the counters get smaller? Will
    it remain monoline which I don't think it can in heavier weights or will it become
    more stressed?\r\n\r\nI am really looking forward to seeing the bolder cuts and
    the very best of luck with it."

  body: "I like you typeface. Here some comments. In the thin version I think you
    will have to redraw your S, s at my point of view. Here my suggestion : your design
    as a kind of \u201Csquare\u201D look in their curves and I don't find that in
    the S. The outside of the s is too round, try to work with the curve of the c,
    g. I wonder if the problem come from the spin, it could be less oblique to leave
    more space to draw a higher curve on both side. Some letters in the extra bold
    are a bit out of your thin version. Look your k the two oblique join the vertical
    stem nor in the thin version. Also there are some bump in the cure (pqbdnm) and
    the horizontal line in the number  seems a bit to large. Hope this will help you."

    I did study a little their construction but I think is easier to see them on text
    and ask a native reader to get some input.\r\n\r\nI noticed that some more arragement
