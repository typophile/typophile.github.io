body: "In the course of the \"Fixing Futura\" client project, a slab version came
  in handy. There certainly has been a recent uptick in the slab choices: grotesque
  slabs, humanist slabs, geometric slabs etc. Firmly in the strict geometric camp,
  I like how this has some of the old school flavor of Lubalin Graph and Rockwell,
  without the eccentricities.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/futuresque_slab_3905.gif]\r\n\r\nYou
  may also notice I tried some of the suggestions from the previous thread including
  a vertical sheer on the c and s."
