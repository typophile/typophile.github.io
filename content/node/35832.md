  ask if there are any design or typography related places which I should visit. I
  will definitely visit the Tschichold exhibition at the St. Bride Libray. Therefore
  I have one more question: Is it possible to visit the library and look through some
  old books or do I have to sign on.\r\n\r\n\r\ngreetings: Steven"

    the St. Bride's reading room will be closed for a while. For further information:\r\nhttp://stbride.org/events_education/events/temporaryclosure\r\n\r\nYou
    don't have to sign in at the library. However, in my experience it is best to
    contact the library first if you have a specific request. Most of the collection
    is tucked away, as apparently the reading room contains just 7% of their collection.
