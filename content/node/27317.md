    N could be too wide.

    without reading the text.\r\nwhat i saw first was a S and a V, and then i saw
    a S and a Y. but i did not see S and N.\r\n\r\nbut later when i read the text
    i noticed that it must be S and N.\r\n\r\ndid you notice that?\r\n\r\nok\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n\r\nPascal

    one of them?

  body: "Satya, \r\n\r\nNice batch of sketches.  \r\n\r\nI agree with Pascal; I saw
    an S and V at first as well.  I think it has to do with that bottom left piece.
    \ It might need a horizontal line (instead of a curve) on the bottom, to serve
    as the beginning of the N.  You could try minimizing the S more.  Make it thinner
    possibly.  You've got to play with the form of that bottom piece so it conveys
    the N more instantly.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's a pretty good integration.  A few
    tweaks and you should have it."

    the size of everyone else's even though there's supposed to be a dimensions limit?

  body: Satya, your design looks really nice. By the way, (this is a bit late) I immeditely
    saw S and N without a trace of doubt. And you had such useful tips from everyone
    too. The final one looks really good.

  body: "A bit late, but it looks nice. Although I too had difficulty seeing the N
    at first.\r\n\r\nJust on a sidenote, you could also have traced one of your hand
    drawn sketches, and tweak it. Instead of using fonts I mean. With exisiting letterforms,
    you maybe are a bit more limited in the ways to solve the problem. Or is that
    what you did?"
