  body: "\"You can not give a gift of something you do not own.\"\r\n\r\nCan you lease
    something you yourself did not pay rights for? I believe Bookman was an ATF release
    and itself based on earlier faces that trace back near a century. Did Bitstream,
    ITC, Jukebox, lease their versions from ATF? I'm guessing likely not. Foundries
    have a grand history of theft themselves.\r\n\r\nThere was a time, not so very
    long ago in the scheme of things, that when you bought type, yes indeed, you owned
    it, and you could do whatever you wanted with it (except, of course, reproduce
    it as your own).\r\n\r\nEULAs are a brilliant legal manipulation to cover up the
    industry's inability to protect its own product. Digital type certainly did not
    start out this way.\r\n\r\nGerald"
