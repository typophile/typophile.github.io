  the opposite of a loupe, so you'd look through it and see things really small and
  sharp, as though they were further away?\r\n\r\n(Thanks \u2013 and pardon if this
  is a silly question. One of my main problems is I don't know what this is really
  called, so I can't even search very well.)"

  body: "Ah! So that's how that works. Thanks!\r\nThis is minor, but: I wonder if
    there are any ones out there that are designed to be work tools rather than for
    scientific experiments and/or classrooms. Can anyone recommend a concave lens
    with a handle? :)"

  body: They were easy to get years ago but I have not seen them lately.  I will check
    around and see if by some slim chance, I still have mine.  I have not used it
    in 40 years so I don't hold out much hope.

    If they don't have one, I'll bet they would order one for you. Amazon might have
    one, too.\r\n\r\nI still have mine, and I still use it -- it is an invaluable
    tool. I'm keeping it.\r\n"

    able to find yet, maybe I'm just doing it wrong\u2026). \r\nThanks a bunch \u2013
    you're really too kind\u2026 I've sent you email."

    looked for a mfr number to offer you, Nina, but could find no markings. Sounds
