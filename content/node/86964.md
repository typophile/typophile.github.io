body: "Hello typophiles,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anybody knew of companies strictly
  offering custom type services (no retail releases). Are there any? I had thought
  of Dalton Maag, but they seem to be offering quite a few retail fonts now. Maybe
  [[http://www.pangeadesign.se/]]? I am not sure where to look for this information.
  \r\n\r\nAny help would be very appreciated!\r\n\r\nRuxandra"

  body: I am rather curious at to why "strictly custom services" has any validity
    when it comes to purchasing a typeface design. Are we wading into the old "Perceived
    Value" realm, where paying a princely sum is supposedly a guarantee of superior
    quality?

  body: "Thanks a lot everybody!\r\n\r\nI think explaining why I am looking for this
    information beforehand would have been wiser. I am working on a short masters
    thesis on the state of the independent type foundry industry today, and, as part
    of my introduction, I have created a schema of the different players in the business
    around type design, including foundries that offer retails fonts, and also those
    companies that don't. I wanted to give some examples of the latter, but it was
    much harder than I thought, as the ones I wanted to include (ex: Dalton Maag),
    recently transitioned towards offering retail fonts as well. It's interesting
    to see how this model is becoming rare, and now mostly applies to companies that
    do other design and identity work along with custom type design, as mentioned
    by Johan.  "

    type (whether they do other type of work such as graphic design as well or not)

    though: [[http://shop.gestalten.com/type-navigator.html]]. Paul van der Laan and
    Pieter van Rosmalen from Bold Monday, among others, also use it to describe their

    phrases.\r\n\r\nOf course, one can leave the definition vague. That just means
    that besides the obvious cases, there will be plenty of uncertainty about whether
    certain firms are \"indie\" or not, notably Nick's examples.\r\n"

    Too rare, and custom vs retail work is a continuum rather than a binary classification.\r\n\r\nMore
    interesting might be to survey some foundries and ask what % of their annual income
    is from retail fonts, custom fonts, other type-design/production-related work
    (hinting?), or \"other\" (graphic design?). Or even just the relative proportion
    of custom font income vs retail font income, you could show them on a continuum

    all this and hopefully before the project's deadline!\r\n\r\nAnd about the \"strictly
