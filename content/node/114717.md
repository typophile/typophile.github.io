body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nMy first post, so abt me: \r\nI'm a programmer (c/c++/python/perl),
  but fonts are my hobby. So, please forgive me for any gaps in my knowledge on fonts.\r\nI've
  successfully converted a free nastaleeq font to woff and am able to use it on my
  server and results are great.\r\nNow, I'm trying to optimize the load time of the
  page, which is obnoxious given the fine nastaleeq font.\r\nSo, I got into subsetting.
  I'm using a script to subset based on text I'm going to send out, and the resulting
  font looks fine to me.\r\nI checked it in FontForge and compared with the original
  to the best of my (sparse) knowledge. Things look OK to me.\r\nHowever, the text
  that looks correct (using ligatures) with the original ttf or woff, renders with
  isolated forms with the subset font.\r\nI verifed that the subset font had the ligature
  at the same place as the original.\r\nMy text is unicode and so is the font. I can
  see GSUB(ccmp,init,medi,fina,rlig,calt,single) and GPOS(curs,mark,kern,mkmk etc)
  in the subset font\r\n\r\nPlease help me identify why the ligatures stop working
  with the subset font. In other words, please let me know what is required in the
  font to make ligatures work, that might be getting left behind. Thanks."

    to account for the new repertoire of glyphs -- I assume you are doing that?\r\n\r\nYou
    might verify the font with [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontvalidator.mspx|Microsoft
    Font Validator]] or some other integrity-checking tool.\r\n\r\nPS: What free nastaleeq
    font did you start with?"

  body: "Thank you Bob,\r\nI will try Microsoft Font Validator. \r\n\r\nI assume that
    the script(bitbucket.org/philip/font-optimizer/src) is doing the right stuff,
    but I don't have any basis to judge except for FontForge being able to open it
    and the subset being present in there. So, a validator would be the right thing
    to use. \r\n\r\nAfter posting here, I converted the subset font to woff using
    FontSquirrel and the woff is working as expected. Now, I'm curious what FS must
    have fixed in the subset font?\r\n\r\nI'm experimenting with Jameel Noori Nastaleeq.ttf
    which is ~10MB(~6MB woff)"

    body: Bob, I tried font validator. It displays a lot of warnings and errors for
      both the working and the problematic subset. I'm confused. It there a quick
      reference that clearly states what constitutes a (minimal) font with ligature
      and hinting/kerning functionality?

  body: When you say it doesn't render correctly in your subset, are you testing with
    a browser? Or in a desktop program?

    body: I'm testing with a browser(Firefox). My subset has individual/isolated forms
      of meem, qaaf, ta & daal, as well as a replacement glyph of these combined nicely
      in a nastaleeq ligature. With the subset font, these letters are rendered in
      isolated forms, not the ligature. However, once passed through fontsquirrel,
      it renders properly.
