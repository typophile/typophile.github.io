  body: It's the other way around, I think. The O follows the general contrast of
    the face, plus it's an original member of the band. The U came later, and probably
    takes its contrast from V.

  body: The upstroke in "U" is thin (as in all other letters). "O" isn't.

  body: I think in early calligraphy o was made with two seperate downstrokes, rather
    than a single anticlockwise loop.

  body: The right stroke of the O and o <em>is</em> thin in most script styles when
    there is stroke contrast.

  body: "That might be it, Justin. I've never once seen it handwriting, though. I've
    seen a numeral \"0\" with thinner upstroke. Useful to differentiate it from \"o\",
    I guess \u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nMark: Can you give me some examples?"
