  body: "Agree with bojev. Journal Sans is better candidate, overall design comes
    closer but Bold weight is not enough \"bold\" (is there any Journal Sans Black?).
    Could also have been manipulated and artificially emboldened by adding an outline
    strokes. It also reminds me of NIVEA logo. \r\nMore in the same, matching design
    but these letters only (need to be emboldened): [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/erbar/|Erbar
    Bold]] (Paratype states that Journal Sans design has been \"based on Erbar\"),
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/relay/|Relay Black]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/simplo/|Simplo
    Black]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/penumbra/|Penumbra Sans Bold]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/ealing/|Ealing Black]]"

  body: Journal Sans could also have been opened in Fontographer and the Change Weight
    feature used to make a "Black" version.
