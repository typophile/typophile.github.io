  from the June 2007 issue of the Thailand Tatler, a magazine I picked up on a recent
  trip to Bangkok. Does anyone recognize this face? Or if anyone could suggest something
  similar, that would be helpful as well. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Thailand-Tattler_4961.jpg]"

    a HTF custom job."

  body: "this has a nice feel to it. However, the caps are too heavy and the n and
    h are too wide and the leg gets heavy out of the join too soon (needs more thick-thin
    contrast like the other letters). I know its not up for critique but its got so
    many nice things going for it (c e f s g) that I hate to see those unfortunate
    oddities.\r\nJust my 2\xA2\r\n\r\nCurious on the ID as well.\r\n"

    Good one, Stewf. ;^)"
