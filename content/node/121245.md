  body: "what the circle looks like GOTHAM BOLD, with a little more weight... but
    I'm not so sure, the \"U\" does not fit.\r\nthe inside I think this hand painted.\r\n\r\nmaybe
    someone knows the exact font."

  body: "Thanks.\r\nThis is a very old sign, maybe 1940's.\r\nThe kind of typeface
    I imagine Tobias Frere-Jones used as a reference for Gotham."

  body: "That version of the Bell System logo was first introduced in 1939, and persisted
    until Saul Bass created his iconic revision in 1969. \r\n\r\n\u201CPublic Telephone\u201D
    resembles Akzidenz-Grotesk (the |C| especially), but your sample has a much rounder
    |O| than the one in A-G. Without knowing an approximate date for the sign, it\u2019s
    hard to pin down the original face.\r\n\r\nThese digital typefaces could help
    you approximate the look:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/\r\nhttp://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/"

  body: "Nobel would work as well, but the counters on the B aren\u2019t as long/horizontal
    as the ones on your sample.\r\n\r\nFont Bureau used to sell a typeface called
    Bonn Caps (designed by Neville Brody) that, save for a pointy |N|, is a very good
    match to your sample. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t find a legitimate source for
    it."

  body: "So interesting to read about the history of Bell in light of the \"net neutrality\"
    issues in the news right now.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your info KT.\r\n\r\n*A
    hilarious site addressing privacy and information in the telephone era:-)\r\nhttp://www.grayflannelsuit.net/blog/saul-bass-att-logo-design-1969\r\n\r\n*Good
    article:\r\nhttp://omahaworks.net/bell-system---we-history.html\r\n\r\nThe Creator
    of the Bell and AT&T Logos\r\n\"The [Bass & Yager] design firm had created the
    famous bell symbol for the nationwide phone monopoly in the late 1960s. This icon--which
    achieved a remarkable 93 percent recognition rate in the United States [emphasis
    added] --aspired to the simplicity and directness of a sans serif letterform.
    In 1984, the familiar bell symbol was transferred to the divested \"Baby Bells,\"
    and Bass & Yager designed a striated sphere for AT&T, aiming to signify the corporation's
    international stature and the ascendance of digital communications.\" \r\n\r\nThe
    AT&T Long Lines Department was responsible for connecting the local Bell companies
    together to provide long distance telephone communication between each Bell company.
    \ Here are two logos representing the time period between 1939 and 1963 and the
    time period after 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
