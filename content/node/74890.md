body: "I am designing a logo for a polish company and would like to use a typeface
  designed by a Polish type designer. I came across Grotesk Polski FA, but I have
  not found anywhere to \"try it out\" or test set the companies name to see if it
  works. Does anyone know of a website that has it? I have had no luck with the websites
  I normally go to.\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Grotesk Polski FA is based on Antykwa P\xF3\u0142tawskiego, digitalised by
    J. M. Nowacki, and available for free [[http://www.jmn.pl/poltawski.html|here]].\r\nYou
    could also try [[http://www.2plus3d.pl/artykuly/danova-typograficzne-spotkanie-z-jackiem-mrowczykiem|Danova]],
    by J. Mrowczyk, which bases on both typefaces (then contact 2plus3d.pl magazine).
    You can use Danova for longer texts; and that's probably important.\r\n"
