  Indesign CS3.\r\n\r\nWe have some artworks all set up in illustrator CS3 and most
  of the type has\r\na 20% tint of black set to overprint using the APPEARANCE palette,
  the problem I\u2019m having is we have now got to set the files up in Indesign,
  is there a way we can have the text in colour with the overprint just like Illustrator.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    are printing digitally you should use a multiply blending mode instead of using
    'Overprint Fill/Stroke' in the attributes palette. If it is being lithographically
    printed then use the attributes palette to do it and when you are exporting your
    document change the compatibility to Acrobat 4 and under 'Output' change 'color
    conversion' to 'convert to destination' then check the simulate overprint box.
    Export it and hopefully that should do it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the reply smongy\r\n\r\nNot sure if I made my post all that clear.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I\u2019ve got is a piece of copy say in 485C with a 20% black overprint, now in
    Illustrator\r\nyou can create this with one type path using appearance, but the
    only way I can create this\r\nin Indesign is by having two paths,  first one in
    the 485C and the second on top with the \r\n20% black overprint. What I want to
    know is can I achieve this with just one path??\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The way to go is to use a Mixed Ink:\r\nPalette Swatches: choose New Mixed
    Ink Swatch.\r\nDefine necessary mix \u2014 in your case 485C (100%) and Black
    (20%).\r\nApply where needed.\r\nCheck in Sep Prev if it works.\r\n\r\nNeed more
    mixes with the same colours? Use Mixed Ink Group, where you can make a LOT of
    combinations in one go.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
