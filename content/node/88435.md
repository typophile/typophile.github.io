  will comment below when i will finish to read it.\r\n<a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/garmar/notehead_specs.pdf\"
  target=\"_blank\">link</a>\r\n\r\nI was thinking about a parametrical solution for
  noteheads, as it's one of the musical glyphs that fits the variables of stroke,
  direction and orientation. There's a little bit of math inside, hope to handle it....\r\n"

  body: "It digs way too much into math... But I like the design process. \r\nAnyway,
    it lacks of some stuff I was looking for, for example an explanation about countershapes
    in empty headnotes...\r\nwhy the half-note countershape seems to be reversed?
    I have to go deeper inside those issues..."
