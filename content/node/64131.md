  art?\r\nI'm particulary interested in the type used on the \"Retold by\"/\"Pictures
  by\" credit and the names \"Jon Scieszka\"/\"Mary Blair\", in addition to the title.
  Also i think the book text in the second pic is Minion Pro - can anyone confirm?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: "\"Retold by\" etc. looks very similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/canterbury-old-style-rr/|Canterbury
    Old Style]] althoughugh the R seems different. Maybe there is another variation
    of this typeface?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Tamas Ferencz ---"
