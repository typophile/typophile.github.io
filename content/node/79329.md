  in a CD package design, and I'm trying to find a serif face with lowercase glyphs
  that will match it as closely as possible.  Ivory is great for Display use, but
  I need something for album credits / thanks / etc.  Right now I'm working with Caslon,
  but it's not quite right. Any suggestions?"
