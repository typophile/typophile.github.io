		<div class="commentbody">Not so much starting palettes, as that would be dependent on the content of the job at hand, but you could perhaps take a broad look by looking at one solid example of each of some of the major classifications of typeface.

Maybe serifs: an old style (such as Garamond), a transitional (such as Baskerville), a modern (such as Bodoni), and a slab (such as Beton); sanserifs: a neo-grotesque (such as Univers), a humanistic (such as Gill Sans), and a geometric (such as Futura). Examining the design, designers, historical background, and contrasts between these is rewarding. The first few pages in Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style chart the development of type with respective nuances nicely. 

Also a good excercise is to hunt through the available glyphs of a font, to discover alternates and other features such as ornaments - the Adobe Originals serif faces are good examples.

Hope that helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would suggest looking through some magazines from the 1930s (<em>Saturday Evening Post, Fortune, Ladies Home Journal</em>, etc.)  and finding a piece of typography that you like the look of, then attempting to create a digital facsimile of it.

The piece should have sufficient complexity, with small caps used somewhere.

Firstly, you will have to identify the typeface, which may be done with the aid of Matt MacGrew's <em>American Metal Typefaces</em>.

The trickiest part will be justification, as the defaults of digital justification are quite different from those of metal type. There was also not so much kerning back then.

This difficult exercise will help you acquire expert skills in layout apps, and give you an appreciation of the relationship between typeface, time and technology, which is fundamental to typography. A design such as Garamond, for instance, has been re-rendered with each generation of technology and is still going strong. 

The issue of press gain is significant, as it has varied over time, and is different for different media (e.g. coated/uncoated stock, screen display). There are a number of ways to deal with this, most notably by choosing different "cuts" of the same typeface, or adding minute amounts of stroke in InDesign/Quark, or by playing with the various rasterization settings in Photoshop. And one has to be aware of the different rendering abilities of browser applications and screen devices.

You will find that the effect of a font is quite different in a laser printout than when printed offset, or letterpress.

With all these variables in mind, I would say that for educational purposes, it would be best to go with common faces that have been around a while, such as those recommended by James, so that you can observe their behavior across the board and compare it with your own use of them—although I don't believe that such faces are necessarily the best choices for contemporary design, as they are too "safe", and don't express the emergent zeitgeist as well as new faces do.
