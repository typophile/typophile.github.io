    target="_blank">Maiandra</a>, but I&#39;m still looking.

    target="_blank">Tempus Sans SC</a>.  <BR> <BR>Still Looking.

    target="_blank">Part 6 of the Script Font ID Guide</a>, and those two were the
    closest I saw.  <BR> <BR>I give up for now.

  body: That S is a dead ringer for ITC Tempus, if you heavy it up a bit. The overall
    shape and even the little bumps and lumps match. I&#39;d say there&#39;s a good
    chance that that&#39;s what this is, with some modifications &#40;mainly to the
    D and the U&#41;.
