body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've designed a font in one of my classes at design school, the
  idea was to have the font feel as if it had been folded out of a sheet. And then
  I also made tehe font from a sheet, folded it and fotographed it so I had a Clean
  and a real version.\r\n\r\nNow I am working with a fiend to make the letters in
  3D and stick it in an Augmented Reality app so that you can see how the font is
  only realy visible from one perspective.\r\n\r\nIt's still work in progress but
  I was wonderin how you would react, if we could get any tips, maybe where to drop
  this idea or which type of people might be interested in this so we have an idea
  wehere to take this project.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCoen.\r\n\r\nwhat were planning
  in AR: http://vimeo.com/99744592\r\n\r\nMy project at school: http://coendekoning.com/folding_fraktur.html"

  body: Oh this is very clever. I think the target audience for this would be rather
    big. Blackletters aren't particularly fashionable these days, but I think any
    designer would appreciate this project. I think it's really more about the play
    with perspectives which a broken script really lends itself for, than it is about
    blackletters.
