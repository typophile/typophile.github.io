<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello <br>I bought a font today (Gabriel Martinez Meave's Arcana) and I'm trying to figure out how to make this work: I am running Mac OS 9.1 and have Suitcase 9. The font came in Open Type format and I don't know how to load it so I can access the full character set -- Suitcase doesn't recognize it at all and when I loaded it directly into the System folder the extra characters don't show up. Does anyone know how to do this? Thanks for any help you can give me.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I assume you bought this from Adobe. Have you contacted them?</div>

<div class=commentbody>You need the latest version of ATM, and an "OpenType Savvy" application. I'm not sure what the score is with Suitcase, but sticking the font in the "Fonts" folder in the system folder should load it. <br> <br>If you're trying to use this font with XPress then forget it, it's not OT savvy. I think your choices are PhotoShop 7.0, Illustrator 10 or InDesign. If you aren't using those apps then you probably aren't going to get anywhere with extended characters - but the standard range should work with almost any app (barring some versions of Illustrator - 6/7 I think).</div>

<div class=commentbody>I am not sure you're right about Quark, Jim. I was told any <br>application that can use a TT font can use an OT font - it's <br>just that PS 7 and InD 2 are the only apps to take advantage <br>of the special features of OT. <br> <br>There's a difference between "savvy" and "compatible".</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks a lot for your help, guys. It looks like what you're saying about using Photoshop 7 or Illust. 10 is exactly right. Although it doesn't seem like these limitations are very clearly spelled out on Adobe's website. (Let the buyer beware...) <br> <br>Ah, technology, I love it so. Is it too late to go back to dry transfer lettering?</div>

<div class=commentbody>There are three aspects to OpenType: the font format, the character encoding (Unicode), and the layout intelligence (OTL). Different systems and applications have different levels of support for these three aspects. Using the lastest versions of ATM, system font support or FreeType (the latter mainly for Linux), most systems are capable of installing the font format and correctly rendering the outlines. <br> <br>Systems and applications with Unicode text processing will be able to access all encoded characters in the font. Applications with at least this level of support include all Windows NT/2000/XP apps, Cocoa apps on Mac OS X, some Adobe apps (InDesign and PhotoShop). Applications that do not support Unicode text processing will only reveal an 8-bit subset of the encoded characters (some may be able to reveal multiple subsets as if they were separate fonts). It should be noted that Quark Xpress does not support Unicode text processing. Neither does Illustrator, but it is considered quite likely that the next version will. <br> <br>Applications that support OpenType Layout provide access to unencoded glyphs in the font via OTL lookups and features. Note that not all applications will provide the same level of OTL support, and a font may contain features that are not yet accessible in your OTL-savvy app. Currently, InDesign and PhotoShop provide the best levels of OTL support for non-complex scripts. The Windows version of MS Office provides the best level of support for complex scripts.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Stephen, Troy's question was really "how do I access the extended character set", and the answer is "in Quark you can't". The situation is as I stated, nearly any app (including XPress) can use the standard (8-bit) character set, except (specifically) some versions of Illustrator (which cannot use an OpenType font at all).</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm sorry, Jim. You're right. I misread his question. <br> <br>I just saw this and thought I'd clarify: <br><i>If you're trying to use this font with XPress then forget it, it's not OT savvy.</i> <br> <br>But I should learn how to read first!</div>
