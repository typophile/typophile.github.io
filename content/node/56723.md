  much searching nothing has surfaced for this type, found on all boxart for New Wave
  Films' DVD releases in the UK: it shares characteristics with Gotham (Hoefler) and
  Akzidenz Grotesk (Berthold), but it's distinguished by unusual characters such as
  the cap-Q in this image. Anyone care to shed a little light?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quietchaos_4418.jpg]"

    like to say that I figured it out, but I simply asked the company. But success
    nonetheless!"

    ignored.
