body: "Hey there, I\u2019m having a lot of problems getting ID CS2 to deliver acceptable
  word spacing when I justify text. I\u2019ve tried different settings; manually breaking
  words; no hypenation; playing with the \u201CBetter Spacing/Fewer Hyphens\u201D
  slider; changing fonts; individually adjusting ALL the controls under Justification;
  removing nearby object which force wraparound. To no effect, it still lays out type
  with unacceptably large or small word spaces. Ref attached JPEG screen-shot for
  a reference sample. Font is Franklin Gothic Book (but seems to have no relevance
  to problem). Working on a PC.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m relatively new to InDesign CS2 but
  had a lot of exposure to Quark a few years back so I know there must be an answer
  to this problem. All input appreciated.\r\n"

  body: "What you could try as a test would be to use InDesign's single-line composing
    mode, pick the same values you use in Quark (70-100-150?), using the the same
    old Type 1 font, and see what happens. Most single-line composing programs work
    about the same, so if the two are making the same line ending decisions, you have
    a starting point.\r\n\r\nI came to ID from TeX, which uses a paragraph optimization
    routine which is to my mind superior to ID's paragraph composition mode. Could
    just be sour grapes on my part, I suppose. Anyway, I found that I had to go into
    the fonts & make the \"ideal\" wordspace smaller, usually right around 200/1000,
    then use 80% 100% 120% as justification settings. You could get the same effect
    by varying the ideal & min percentages, I suppose, but we're trying to set up
    fonts so our comps can just use 80-100-120 for text settings.\r\n\r\nTo give you
    some idea of the difference with TeX, we use to use the equivalent of 65% 100%
    140% to get roughly the same results -- of course, TeX would not exceed certain
    limits (you get an overfull box to resolve by hand); Neither Quark nor ID do that.\r\n\r\nI
    did look at your PDF. As you say, it is a mess & I can't imagine what values gave
    you so tight a setting. As to loose, hum.\r\n\r\nAnyway, try the single line composition
    mode."

  body: Probably you've already ruled out this possibility, but I've experienced similar-looking
    justification problems in ID2 on occasion when I've missed stripping out a few
    unwanted hard returns from the text before placing it into a text box. Scanned
    text seems to be the worst for causing this problem (the OCR software usually
    puts a hard return at the end of every line). You can usually spot them in the
    story editor.

  body: Funny, I've had more problems with InDesign and ragged text, it seems sometimes
    to have a mind of its own. I end up having to manually rag nearly everything.
    Didn't have this problem in Quark.

  body: AFAIK, InDesign also takes into account the language assigned to the text,
    when performing hyphenation. You might want to experiment with that setting.

  body: "Did you define basic parameters for Justification? To do this, close all
    documents in InDesign. Then go the Paragraph-pallette and choose Justification
    (via the triangle-button) or use the keyboard-combination Command-Option-Shift-J.\r\nHere
    you define values for Word & Letter Spacing and Glyph Scaling. Eg my standard
    values are:\r\nWord Spacing - Minimum 75% - Desired 87% - Maximum 100%\r\nLetter
    Spacing - Minimum 0% - Desired 0% - Maximum 0%\r\nGlyph Scaling - Minimum 99%
    - Desired 100% - Maximum 101%\r\nAuto Leading: 100%\r\nThese values will be used
    for all documents you CREATE afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe values above give the Composer
    some latitude when Justifying text. For unjustified text reasonably tight wordspacing
    is achieved.\r\nFor some typefaces it is necessary to change these values, eg
    Gill Sans, which is way too loose.\r\nHope this helps.\r\n"

  body: In the loose setting, is that a non-breaking hyphen? If so, why? If that stub
    could move up, then the look would be much better. And what of the next line (that
    is not shown). There must be some monster word there that wouldn't fit in the
    remaining space.

  body: "Well, I'm not sure what made the difference EXACTLY but things are looking
    much better today - thanks for all the hints and tips. Here are some of the things
    I did/changed:\r\n\r\n1. Turn on \"Show Invisibles\" Ctrl+Alt+i\r\nThis allowed
    me to find at least one soft return that was adding to the problem.\r\n2. Change
    the Justification settings\r\n    - Word spacing 90/95/100 which may be tight
    but it certainly helped with the words that were too far apart\r\n    - I left
    letter spacing at 0\r\n    - Glyph spacing 99/100/101; no significant visual impact
    on this document but it probably helped somewhere.\r\n3. I turned hyphenation
    on and then off again and I SWEAR it helped. OK maybe it didn't really but I know
    it didn't hurt. It made me feel more powerful, at least\r\n\r\nAttached is a \"Before
    and After\" image. There are no soft returns in this copy - it's all just from
    changing justification settings and getting rid of that soft return on one line.
    \r\nThanks for all your help! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/justification_problem2_5038.jpg]"

    it's always a good practice to rip out soft returns (and multiple hard returns)
    when doing DTP, either in whatever program one is using to manipulate the text
    or in InD.  Cures a range of problems (as you've discovered), for starters...."
