body: "This is an experimental type face where all glyphs are constructed using solid
  equilateral triangles. It turned out one can build the whole character set out of
  triangles with little or no compromise on harmony. The result: a new sort of blackletter
  with more than a hint of minimalism. Althoght I have not finished the metrics and
  kerning, it produced quite serviceable text even at small sizes, that could have
  made any tonsured monk very proud.\r\n\r\nAny comments?\r\n\r\nTybor\r\n"

    I wonder if adding a stroke (expanding the shapes slightly) would help soften
    it a little, something like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nimrodel-72_3721.png]\r\n"

  body: "for me it s an interesting typo - good modular work.\r\nthis is some sort
    of modern blackletter typeface - i think you should generate more vertical elements,
    develop the font as a COND one... for example take the small \"e\" - if you make
    it 3-4 modules higher it will look far different and will not have any reading
    problems.\r\nanyway - it is still good work!!!\r\n_____________________\r\nwww.behance.net/epixs\r\nepixs@yahoo.com\r\n+359887323000"
