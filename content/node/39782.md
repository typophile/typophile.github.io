body: "Im looking for a font for a logo. The letters involved are DETECT and the company
  produces both the hardware (home security alarm) and the software for the alarm/security
  industri. So the font needs to have a feeling of both Security and Software development.
  I would be greatfull to hear your thoughts and ideas about this. Thank you.\r\nPetter"

    'Detect' would look nicer than 'DETECT'\r\n\r\nTry Univers also - possibly Black
