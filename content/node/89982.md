    \r\nIt's a great place, no doubt, but it's not always going to be comprehensive,
    and it's not the quickest."

    missing out\r\non promotion. Hmmm, or maybe they only had\r\nroom for their own
    people and didn't want non-\r\nmembers showing up... On the other hand if\r\nadmission
    isn't free then they could've found\r\na bigger place and made more money. Maybe\r\nthey
    have a running deal with Custom Hotel;\r\nOtis <em>did</em> once facilitate a
    brainstorming session\r\nfor TypeCon-LA there. Many factors, certainly;\r\nbut
    the net result is still sad.\r\n\r\n* I have no shortage of things\r\nto do...
    plus this sort of event is\r\nrarely hard to crash anyway.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
