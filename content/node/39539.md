  the middle of the 16th century. Could somebody put me into the right direction to
  find more information about them? Thank you.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bianco_6064.jpg]"

    fleurons, I believe.\r\n\r\nYou'll find some digital versions in this collection:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/arabesque-ornaments-two-mt/\r\n\r\nThe
    early 20th-century designer & typographer Bruce Rogers was fond of using them
    to great effect. \r\n\r\nIf you search on some of those terms, you may find some
    info.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
