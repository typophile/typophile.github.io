  body: Johan, <BR>looks nice, due to some details I recognize on the first view...
    The Uppercase C looks unbalanced compared to the rest of the alphabet. Try to
    increase the scale of the vertical axis a bit, and maybe also decrease the horizontal
    width a little bit. It&#39;s hard to tell... it could also be the antialiasing
    of the gif?  <BR>The uppercase &#34;S&#34; are a bit low compared to the T. Increase
    the height a few steps. <BR>The &#34;A&#34; feels a bit too condensed. <BR>The
    &#34;G&#34; are nice! <BR> <BR>The lowercases looks charmy, but you could try
    a few alternatives on &#34;a&#34; &#34;j&#34; and maybe &#34;f&#34;? I think those
    letters are the main language of your font, but I think you can do better... Compare
    the x-height on your &#34;f&#34; with your ligatures...  <BR> <BR>Nice work. <BR>

  body: Maybe I&#39;m wrong but the &#39;a&#39; looks like its slightly above the
    baseline next to some letters like &#39;r&#39; and &#39;m&#39;. Roundness needs
    to go below the baseline a little to compensate. <BR> <BR>What letter did you
    draw first?

  body: 'Thanks for the feedback.  <BR>In my eagerness to post my typeface I failed
    completely making the gif; of course the &#34;i&#34; and &#34;j&#34; dots should
    align as well as the &#34;f&#34;. Sorry bout that. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve made some
    changes to the &#34;C&#34;, &#34;S&#34; and extended the &#34;A&#34; a little
    bit. I&#39;ve also done a draft of an italic. <BR> <BR>Mike: lowercase &#34;a&#34;

  body: Hi Johan, <BR> <BR>I like it a lot. It&#39;s a friendly open type that, for
    me, is a good mix of the Helvetica, Din and Interstate.  <BR>Perhaps the UC &#39;W&#39;
    could be a little more open. For my feelings it needs a little bit more white
    space inside. It works in the italic lc weight though. <BR>I agree with Andreas
    on the UC &#39;C&#39;. But keep the first lc &#39;a&#39;, it&#39;s right for the
    type. The alternate &#39;a&#39; has been done enough allready. <BR> <BR>I like
    the italics. Nice work on the little serif of the lc &#39;r&#39;. Moving it diagonally
    is perfect. <BR> <BR>The type all together feels very Scandinavian. Perhaps find
    a name that comes from up there. <BR>Waiting to see more. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren

  body: 'Oh, I like them. Although they are a little bit different from the regulars
    &#40;because you gave them a sort of serifs&#41;, they work great.  <BR> <BR>Some
    things you might want to look for: <BR>- change the lc &#39;q&#39; a little in
    relation to the lc &#39;p&#39;. Try to give it a little more character. <BR>-
    the lc &#39;a&#39; seems to be to round in the upper left corner of the bowl.
    Optically it needs there the little &#39;serif&#39; like on the lc &#39;m&#39;
    and &#39;n&#39;. If you take that away you might want to change the bowl a little
    to compensate. <BR>- the angle of the lc &#39;o&#39; is off balance with the rest
    of the type. Perhaps it is the jpg rasterization, but it seems to roll to much
    to the right.  <BR> <BR>My favorite: the lc &#39;z&#39;. Sweet. <BR> <BR>With
    the regulars it seems the lc &#39;a&#39; is a little bit to round compared to,
    for instance, the lc &#39;e&#39;. Can that be? It seems to be more a &#39;wide&#39;
    than a &#39;regular&#39;. <BR>Did you optically correct the crossing of the &#39;x&#39;?
    It feels a little out of balance. <BR> <BR>I really like this type, personally.
    Congratulations on the name. Very nice. <BR> <BR>Some of my remarks may be the
    result of the jpg rasterization on screen. In your document it might be OK.  <BR>
    <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren'

    Where&#39;s the rest? <BR> <BR>Ren

  body: 'Hi Johan, <BR> <BR>You really are still working on it. Nice update. I have
    some small suggestions for you: <BR> <BR>- spacing is too tight. I think you can
    give it some 20 em on both sides extra. Maybe more. <BR>- I agree with Kevin on
    the lc a. Make it just a bit shorter. <BR>- Have a look for the center of the
    UC&#39;s, they are not constant. Have a look at the middle bar of the A and the
    E. Try to find a hight that works for all the characters and be consequent. Take
    either the H or the R. <BR>- Personally I think the bowl of the lc a is a bit
    big compared to the lc e. But note that that&#39;s personal. <BR>- Perhaps you
    should make the leg of the lc l a bit longer? <BR>- Have a serious look at the
    lc r. This is a tip Randy Jones gave me on my r: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?29/32542"
    target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?29/32542</a> <BR>- You
    need to work a bit on your numbers, they are a bit out of balance. Some seem to
    wide &#40;2, 3&#41; others to high &#40;8&#41;. <BR> <BR>Other than that, I still
    like it.  <BR> <BR>Later, <BR>'
