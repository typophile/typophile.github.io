  body: 'The sample is a little small, but to me the loops on the k and l look too
    short to be Typo Upright or its near-identical twin, Linoscript, whose loops come
    down to the x-height. As far as I can tell from the provided sample, the loops
    end noticeably above the x-height. All other characters look like Typo Upright,
    particularly the v and the t. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t provide an alternate suggestion.
    <BR> <BR>One thing to note, if I&#39;m reading MyFonts&#39; Test Drive results
    accurately, is the stroke on the end of the v: if it rounds off a little, it&#39;s
    closer to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/linoscript/linoscript/testdrive.html?s=kvt&amp;p=96">Linoscript</a>;
    if it&#39;s more of a straight angle, it&#39;s closer to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/typo-upright/typo-upright/testdrive.html?s=kvt&amp;p=96">Typo
    Upright</a>.'

  body: Hey Chesh, <BR> <BR>Thanks, that sure provoked some intersting closer look.
    I actually like the Linoscript style better, considering the rounded off v&#39;s.
    But I see what you mean by the k&#39;s where it loops below the x-height...&#40;taking
    a closer look, the b&#39;s are the same way too!&#41; Man, I didn&#39;t even see
    that!! you are really good at the details! Thanks for trying!

  body: I did a little match&#39;em up in Photoshop. It definitely looks  <BR>like
    a bold&#40;ened&#41; Linoscript/Typo Upright, but the proportions  <BR>of the
    loops on ascenders and descenders are similar to  <BR>those found on Gando/French
    111 BT &#40;but there several other  <BR>characters like &#39;t&#39;, &#39;d&#39;
    and the numerals don&#39;t match up at all&#41;.  <BR>Furthermore I have the impression
    that the upper branch of  <BR>the &#39;k&#39; is not open but has a loop. <BR>
    <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/11317.gif" alt="comparison.gif">
    <BR> <BR>Does anyone have access to old Linotype specimens? Is there  <BR>a bold
    Linoscript/Typo Upright-like face available on the  <BR>&#40;digital&#41; market?
    <BR> <BR>The mystery deepens...
