<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This is strictly about a graphic interpretation so I sincerely hope that it doesn't become a flash point.
What symbols, images come to your mind when you think about this topic? I have a few in mind but they seem very obvious and I was hoping to get some fresh perspectives.
I am specifically interested in immigration as it existed at the turn of the 20th Century.
Any thoughts are appreciated in advance.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks people. The typewriter angle is one I am mulling over for sure.
What about this scenario? Does this bring anything else to mind?
Apparently when you arrived by boat you sailed past the Statue of Liberty and then landed at Ellis. If you weren't going to NYC after processing there you went to a train terminal in New Jersey and from there you entered America. Trains, the western migration, manifest destiny, etc…
Any more thoughts?

Sounds good, but you’ll have to be very careful to keep the immigration angle from getting lost. Americans have a weird nostalgia about trains.</div>

<div class=commentbody>How about narrowing this down to a font since this is typophile. What font has the spirit of those times? Typewriters, obviously. I was looking at P22 Declaration Pro and it has a feel I like. What I like about it is it's maritime feel and it's placement in our subconscious. It feels just a tad off though.

Maybe for immigration officials working in offices, but I doubt that too many of the immigrants of that period would have had much interaction with typewriters. Something much more blue-collar seems more appropriate. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>From the little bits of writing/printed matter in this book I would suggest three possible approaches:
1. typewriter
2. handwriting - but an old-school script kind of writing - P22 Declaration is in the right direction but maybe too formal. A lot of these photos have writing on them, it's script but not so flourishy.
3. Fonts that were in common use for printed matter at the early part of the century, such as Century Old Style, Cheltenham Old Style, Caslon 540.
Also you might try to keep the design in line with the look of the period, centered type (at least the headlines), nothing too flashy. Keep in mind the limitations of metal type. A broadsheet type of design could be nice.
Also look here: http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=ellis+island+documents&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi

<div class=commentbody>I like direction #2 - Declaration almost had the right feel for me and I think you nailed it when you said it was too formal.
I'll take a look at the last 3.
The first thing I looked at was typewriter and it just didn't do it for me. Haven't had the chance to look at the distressed versions though.
Thanks Patty.

<div class=commentbody>That's what I liked about Declaration - had a slight maritime feel to me. Old maps, etc… But it wasn't quite it.
Thanks for the images Patty - what struck me was the word refugee. That may lead somewhere…
I guess fogginess only got me so far. Here's the design brief:
We are doing a festival in Liberty State Park. This is a new identity - I have the main body of it nailed down and just need the correct spice for the name. The name is All Points West. Apparently that's what they called the train station in New Jersey where the immigrants left for the rest of America. The train station is right there - I believe it is part of the park.
I searched for distressed scripts and Batarde Coulée from Lineto looks promising. Almost there…
Unfortunately I can't find a place to test the text - oh well keep searching.

An early piece I did using this great iconic figure. I see this figure as a Canadian outside of America, to represent immigration. But also I see the Statue of Liberty to represent the true qualities of freedom which still attract the American immigrant to this day.
I'll leave the multicolours and strong thematic repetitions (abstract crescendo and decrescendo), to your own interpretation... </div>

<div class=commentbody>Nice Sharon - I don't know if it's bold enough for an identity but I am definitely going down the road of handwriting fonts today.

<div class=commentbody>Dan, that's great and looks like it might be just what Paul is looking for. The alternates make it actually look handwritten. I think Batarde Coulée may still be too light and formal - reminds me a lot of Chanson d'Amour from MVB. Viner Hand could work but it's so overused.

<div class=commentbody>Kellie -I went down that road and it just felt too literal - but thanks for the thought.
I like that Dan. The price is certainly right. I just tried it and it's a little too real… :)
Those first 2 foundries are really cool Patty - texashero actually lets you download a demo with some letters disabled. That's a pretty cool idea. After trying Emily Austin, Lamar Pen, Houston Pen and Texas Hero I am digging Lamar Pen.
And now I'm in big trouble because I like too many things - time to put it away for the moment and revisit. It will be a miracle if they let me get away with it - a festival identity that isn't the heaviest weight font available. But one never knows…
Thanks everyone.

<div class=commentbody>Hmm, iconographically, I'd say: Hats, trunks, britches, head scarves, smoking pipes, fiddles, sacks, small stacks of books tied with thread, crudely written papers, badly weathered shoes, fleas, lice, beards, monocles, walking sticks. Typographically, for some reason, it makes me think of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-cheltenham/#stylelist|FB Cheltenham]].

<div class=commentbody>You guys are amazing - so many insights.
Going down this road of handwriting it's either Sharon's suggestion (Petronella) or bust for me. It just feels right.
I have poured over those Ellis Island sites and it all came down to that eventually.
thanks

<div class=commentbody>Sharon - it survived. Not only survived but was really liked. I actually used the line "It's the handwriting of every immigrant who went through there on their way to the American Dream" as a justification behind this "anti" logo. Petronella has been purchased, tweaked a tiny bit, outlined and sent off to New York for them to populate it with the bands and other local info.
You can take a look <a href=http://pages.sbcglobal.net/pbc1313/allgraphic/apw%2018x24%20v9%20petronella%20C.jpg><strong>here</strong></a>.
Excellent tip.
I love it - it is SO not what you're supposed to do for a rock fest. Perfect.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Sharon - you're a definite part of this… -:)
I wish I could have done the typesetting for the bands - seems pretty ragged to me but the identity was all the time I can spare.
