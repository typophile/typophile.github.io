  I'm thinking alternate forms, swashes, dicretionary ligatures.\r\n\r\nI would like
  to migrate from using windows to linux, all the things I do I can do in Inkscape
  and Scribus, but the OT features would be a nice touch. I'm open to learning TeX
  or any other piece of software as long as it's usable.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Scribus has no OpenType support altogether, I've seen promises for years
    but nothing so far. Inkscape (and any other GTK+ or Qt application) does not support
    user controllable features, only features that are on by default for a given script.
    The only remaining option is modern TeX engines, both XeTeX and LuaTeX give you
    full control, and you can use [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontspec|fontspec]] package
    which abstracts the low level stuff and provides a fine, higher level interface
    to both engines.\r\n\r\nHowever, Linux distributions are usually a bit behind
    TeX developments, so I'd recommend installing [[http://tug.org/texlive/|TeXLive]]
    and not using distribution supplied packages."
