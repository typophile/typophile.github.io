body: "I got great help on an obscure question I asked on here some months ago about
  italic periods, so I'm going to send something else up the flagpole to see if anyone
  salutes, as it were.\r\n\r\nI am part of a team researching the printing history
  of two books published in what was then western America in the first half of the
  19th century. One was printed in Ohio in 1835 and the other in Illinois in 1844.
  Both books have signature marks (the marks printers used to easily distinguish one
  gathering from another) whose precise purpose we are wanting to determine. I will
  here give specific information about these in hopes you can help us. I will use
  the word \"question\" to identify our specific questions.\r\n\r\n*Book published
  in 1835*\r\n\r\nThe book published in 1835 has 17 gatherings of 8 leaves (16 pages)
  each, with an 18th and final gathering that has only 6 leaves (12 pages). Each gathering
  was made from a single folded sheet. The first signature mark, \"A2\", appears at
  the bottom center on the 5th page of the first gathering; the 5th page is the first
  page of the volume's body, following four pages of introductory matter (title page,
  copyright page, and two pages of preface). The next signature mark, \"B\", appears
  at the bottom center of the 13th page of the first gathering. Both of these signature
  marks are irregular (see next paragraph below). Question: I am wondering if anyone
  out there can divine why these irregular signature marks would have been used.\r\n\r\nBeginning
  with the second gathering, the signature marks appear at regular intervals: the
  first page of each new gathering has a letter of the alphabet, from \"B\" (which,
  you will recall, also appeared in the first gathering) through \"R\", and the second
  recto page (third page) of each new gathering has a number followed by an asterisk
  (presumably to distinguish it from the actual page numbers, which appear at the
  top of the page), from \"2*\" through \"18*\". Obviously, whoever was folding and
  assembling the gatherings would have benefited by the alphabetical marks on the
  first page of each gathering. Question: Of what value would the numerical signature
  marks have been on the second recto of each gathering?\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above,
  the 18th and final gathering of the volume has only 6 leaves instead of 8. Question:
  Why would they have produced a final gathering with 6 leaves rather than just do
  another one with 8 leaves but leaving the final 2 pages blank? I assume they did
  this to save paper, but it seems odd because it presumably would have meant reconfiguring
  the press or the process in some way.\r\n\r\n*Book published in 1844*\r\n\r\nThe
  book published in 1844 contains 12 gatherings of 18 leaves (32 pages) each, with
  a 13th and final gathering of 10 leaves (20 pages). Each gathering was made from
  a single folded sheet. The first signature mark, \"1*\", appears on page 5; this
  is the first page of the body (following four pages of front matter). This is followed
  by the following signature marks: 2 (on page 13), 2* (page 17), 3 (page 25), *3
  (page 29), 4 (page 37), 4* (page 41), 5 (page 49), 5* (page 53), and so forth. You
  can see the pattern here: with the exception of the first page of the first gathering,
  which justifiably does not have a signature mark, the first page of each 32-page
  gathering bears a number; that number is repeated two leaves (four pages) later
  accompanied by an asterisk; and then the number increases by one another four leaves
  (eight pages) later; that number is then repeated two leaves (four pages) later
  accompanied by an asterisk; and so on. The result is that each 36-page gathering
  will have six signature marks, falling on the first, 5th, 13th, 17th, 25th, and
  29th pages of the gathering. Question: Why would they have set up the signature
  marks this way?\r\n\r\nSecond question: Any thoughts on why they would have completed
  the volume with a smaller gathering (10 leaves) rather than sticking with the 18-leaf
  gathering size. I assume they did this to save paper, but it seems odd because it
  presumably would have meant reconfiguring the press or the process in some way."

  body: "What you call a \"gathering\", isn't that more commonly called a <em>folio</em>?
    (A gathering, isn't that a flock of crows? Or a bloody murder or summink.)\r\n\r\n<cite>[the]
    final gathering of the volume has only 6 leaves instead of 8. Question: Why would
    they have produced a final gathering with 6 leaves rather than just do another
    one with 8 leaves but leaving the final 2 pages blank?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell -- no.
    That is, if I understand you correctly. Each folio, when folded twice, adds up
    to 8 pages (both sides count -- 4 'leaves'). When folded again, you get 16 pages,
    and if you only used 12, you get 4 blank pages at the end. Nowadays, that's sort
    of frowned upon (except for the very cheapest sort of paperbacks, the paper equivalent
    of Will Self-Destruct After Reading) -- and I can imagine it was the same then.
    The trick is not to \"save\" some paper, but rather to produce a good book.\r\nThe
    printer would actually print only 12 of the 16 pages -- one 'half' set, numbered
    3-10, and one 'quarter' set, numbered 1-2/11-12. Cut, throw blank quarter away,
    fold small set around larger set.\r\n\r\nAs for the marks, perhaps you can post
    a few photos."

  body: "Theunis: Thank you for your helpful reply. We use the term \"gathering\"
    to refer to any group of leaves. If in the 1835 volume they likely would have
    printed the entire final gathering (16 pages) but then cut a quarter of the pages
    (to get to 12 pages), how would you analyze the situation with the final gathering
    of the 1844 volume, where the final gathering had 20 pages instead of 36?\r\n\r\nI
    am attaching some images from the 1835 volume I mentioned. The images are for
    the 5th and 13th pages of the first gathering, and for the the first and 3rd pages
    of the second gathering. These pages are numbered as follows: unnumbered (equivalent
    of page [5]), 13, 17, and 19. They have signature marks as follows: A2, B, B,
    2*. The pattern established in the second gathering (first recto bears letter;
    second recto bears corresponding numeral) continues for the remainder of the volume;
    the marks in the first gathering are irregular.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unnumbered_6131.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/page
