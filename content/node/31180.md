    this: \r\n\r\nhttp://typographi.com/001029.php\r\n\r\nps. you can find a lot--as
    I did these--by using the 'search' feature in Typophile. \r\n\r\npps. I think
    a quite a few people, including me, find that Avant Garde has a dated and awkward
    look--ironic given its name--whereas Futura still looks great to them. "

    awkward it can seem. I\u2019d add <em>overused</em> (sometimes unnecessarily)
    to that."

  body: still, its one of the fonts that work great for work like flyers for clubs
    and parties. it just looks "cool" and "young", altough of course it also looks
    dated to any typophile. remember, most people look at fonts without any knowledge
    of history of design.
