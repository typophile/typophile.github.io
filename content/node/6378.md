body: 'Hi there,  <BR> <BR>I was a couple of days puzzle with a problem generating
  <BR>fonts in Fontlab. I believe that isn&#39;t weel explained <BR>in the FL manual.  <BR>
  <BR>If I generate a PS1 mac font having the encondings  <BR>selected in &#34;Names&#34;
  mode &#40;and Macintosh Roman&#41;&#41; the <BR>resulting font doesn&#39;t have
  well arranged all the <BR>characters: for example, the greek symbols and so on <BR>&#40;only
  are OK the basic alphabetic symbols, A-Z a-z and <BR>marks, etc&#41;.  <BR> <BR>That
  was bothering me a lot, cause I wanted to put some <BR>ligatures in the place of
  some greek letters &#40;and appel <BR>symbol&#41;... When I tried doing it with
  the old good Fog <BR>and choosing Mac encoding, the font worked well...  <BR> <BR>In
  the begining I thought that the problem was the <BR>&#39;Export prefereces&#39;
  selection and I made tests using <BR>every option there &#40;&#39;Select enconding
  automatically&#39; <BR>and so on&#41;. <BR> <BR>It took me a lot of time to realize
  that for having the <BR>basic PS1 mac font well done, at the moment of <BR>generating
  the font in FL &#42;the CODEPAGE MODE have to be <BR>selected&#42; &#40;in Mac OS
  Roman, of course&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I din&#39;t find another way to get a proper PS1
  font for <BR>Mac. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m doing the things correctly, <BR>but
  for the moment it works.  <BR> <BR>Any comment? Anyone with the same problem?  <BR>
  <BR>Thanks in advance.  <BR> <BR>Ramiro E.'
