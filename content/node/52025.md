  I am faced with another challenge, but I didn't want to create a new topic.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I generated the truetype file for the initial font I've been working on; the kerning
  settings weren\u2019t saved with it. I tried using several programs and saving the
  font multiple times to no avail. When I open the metrics window my settings work.
  How might I fix this problem? \r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is a sort of bug (or feature with unintended consequences) that has
    been in Fontographer forever. It often happens when you paste in a path from Illustrator.
    You can fix it by doing this:\r\n\r\n1. Select the affected characters in the
    main window.\r\n\r\n2. Choose \"Selection Info...\" from the Element menu.\r\n\r\n3.
    Make sure that \"Fill outline\" is checked and that the \"Tint\" is set to 100%.
    (Also make sure that \"Stroke outline\" is unchecked.)\r\n\r\nThis should fix
    the problem."

  body: "Thank you Mark that worked perfectly. \r\n\r\nI do have another question.
    It's pretty obvious that I am a novice at Fontographer.\r\n\r\nWhen I generated
    the font file the kerning settings weren't attributed to the font. How might I
    fix this problem? "

    This thread is now useless to people with a similar problem to your original one
    (for which I provided an answer) since you deleted it and replaced with a new
    question and new title. I don't know the answer to your new question.\r\n\r\nFor
    posterity, the original question was what to do when characters are invisible
    in the Metrics window in Fontographer."
