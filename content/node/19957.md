  Typophiles - \r\n\r\nWhat type would OrgPlus be set in?  \r\n\r\nI'm more of the
  Display font specialist - I know my Gunhead Chick from Mars Police from Pricedown.
  \ Sanserifs for heds and body are a little beyond me - little help!\r\n\r\nBest,

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sage-bold_6215.png]\r\n\r\nThis is \u2018Sage
    Bold\u2019. I googled it and found nothing but a couple of references. It comes
    with four weights and two widths. And clearly, is <em>a bit</em> like that AG
    Old Face\u2026 Does anybody know anything about Sage? And what\u2019s it doing
    on my HD?"
