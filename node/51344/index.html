  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>lododephlise - 10 years after
i dont care if i&rsquo;m generally held to be a phool</p>
<pre><code>                          i discovered the increasing element of debt 
                          i dropped the ball
                          threw it out of bounds, really

                          low is the path of a much older
                          and perhaps much wiser man

                          of course it's not concrete when i spout shit like
                          'my consorts were inert'
                          it is obvious that greater than 50 percent of the 
                          chymicals emanate from the active initiator, at 
                          this stage anyway

                          i'll avoid any distasteful sex-economic 
                          analogies...

                          as mostly that - the hurried gardener - snip
                          perdurabo has dwindled to perdido
                          'now with a little help from the peri-dildo...'

                          that said with eyebrows and zappa voice
                          his subliminal mask slipped a bit
                          call a spade a shovel, but keep al jolson away 
                          from the greasepaint

                          actually i think zappa has been haunting me
                          he has earned his invisible, immortal gypsy reward 
                          and spends all eternity tormenting one fan at a 
                          time in terribly intimate sadistic ways.

                          his paradise.

                          and the better your opinion of his ideas and 
                          ideals, his symphonies and his diatribes, the more 
                          havoc he can wreak with your subconscious mind. he 
                          is of course usually operating transparently. 

                          it is the most efficient method. he just 
                          interjects tiny images, thoughts, ideas, even 
                          lyrics between real-world events which stimulate 
                          him. then like some turn-based nightmare, he can 
                          sit back, sip his vodka sweet-lassi, and watch the 
                          havoc. he seems to have had a lot of practice.

                          the image i'm allowed to have is that it is by 
                          remote control.
                          yes, frank is sitting on a tropical chaise longue 
                          with oversized sunglasses his poodle of the month 
                          club victim, bubbles has recently been thoroughly 
                          shaven to beat the heat of south india...

                          he is currently composing a wild batch of one 
                          liners to completely destroy all of my personal 
                          relationships

                          but i'm on to him

                          'that's part of the plan' he smiles secretively

                          'you're a nutcase, a jabberer - nobody will even 
                          remember this in the flood tide of the daily blah;
                          i only help a little, you know'

                          gee thanks frankie. i'm glad he's not a substance 
                          abuse nut.

                          when hunter thompson joins our ancestors, there 
                          will be stark pandemonium

                          damn spooks

                          the controls really can assume that shape, another 
                          thousand armed sky given false flesh.

                          I never realized the vast angelic hierarchies in 
                          the kingdom of the flies.

                          tsetse, gnats, drosophila

		<div class="commentbody">In order to bridge the gap between machine and mind in AI, we perhaps need to use our imagination and model extrasensory phenomena. We need to model polymental structures with less of a definite gap between them, thus obviating the need to bridge that gap. After all machines can already read each other&rsquo;s minds, why not let them?
The Turing test is a milestone, but someday we are going to arrive at a definition of AI
which also includes creativity and humour. How would a collective view creativity? As a shared resource? In human terms, moral oneupmanship and hypocrisy - would they disappear
or reach a critical meltdown. It may be interesting to attempt models incorporating a great many simpler, even dedicated elements but with these extrasensory sorts of boundaries. Quanta of effect could be shared, and when a cluster provokes attention, 
the sort of attention provoked might aggregate these quanta enough to &ldquo;do something&rdquo;
in a model, convey information or affect chance - low energy cost, high effect.&quot;  - A Chadmon</div>
