  was wondering if someone could help me out. I Recently installed the light and medium
  version of a font, and when I switch to that font family in my word processor, it
  defaults to the medium layout. However, I want to use the light version in stead
  of the medium and the medium as the bold. Is there a way to edit the font files
  (they're in OTF format) so that the light and medium are viewed as medium and bold?\r\nThank
  you!"

    question - their names and source.\r\n  The word processor you're using\r\n  The
    Operating system you're using.\r\n\r\nIt is a very poor idea to change those names,
    even if you could. Particularly if what you have are two members of a larger family
    that already has regular and bold versions. You would make both your fonts and
    your documents incompatible with any other operating environment. (For instance,
    if you changed 'Medium' to 'Bold' and your document was read on a system that
    already had the PROPER 'Bold' version, the user of that system would see the BOLD
    font instead of your intended MEDIUM font.\r\n\r\nIn general, changing the internal
    font names requires a few things:\r\n   1) Permission from the vendor/foundry/source.
    This may or may not be specified in the EULA.\r\n   2) An appopriate program that
    is capable of changing those names and styles etc.\r\n   3) Knowledge of how the
    multiple font name fields and flags in a font interact with each other and with
    other members of the same family. And what you do might have to be different depending
    on the OS and applications involved.\r\n\r\nThere are differences in the ways
    that font families, names and styles are used and displayed on menus by Apple
    and Microsoft Operating Systems and by Microsoft and Adobe applications.\r\n\r\n

    sure it doesn't leave your drive. If you get caught, be prepared to pay for it.\r\n\r\n*
    BTW I'm personally OK with violating a no-mod clause.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
