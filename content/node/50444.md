body: "While absent mindedly sketching out ideas for a wedding invite due to take
  place at St. Paul de Leon Church, instead or writing St., I made the lower case
  't' superscript and place the dot underneath it.\r\n\r\nAfter pondering where I
  had seen this treatment before I remembered some old St. John's Wood tube station
  signage which uses it and after a further search the only other example I could
  find was the new image for St. Pancras station (again, London transport based!)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2316501932_e683bfe4cd_6417.jpg]\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone shed some light on this arrangement?   Presumably it has a historical context?
  \ Is there a right and wrong way of using it?  Is it ever drawn as a single glyph
  or is it up to the designer to decide the relative scale and arrangement?"

    above the string). I suspect that when the line was short enough it was made into
    a dot, and then when printing came it was much more convenient to put the dot
