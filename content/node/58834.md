body: "My colleague Dick Sheaff has built an outstanding collection of ephemera which
  he has generously made available for viewing online. \r\nThe following galleries
  will be of particular interest to typophiles (remarks in quotes are Dick's):\r\n<li><strong>[[http://www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/artistic_printing_album/|Artistic
  Printing:]]</strong> \"[B]etween the late 1870s and the mid-1880s a group of American
  and British letterpress printers developed a design aesthetic that, at its best,
  was clean, bold and graphic. In its purest form, \u2018Artistic Printing'\u2014as
  the practitioners themselves labeled the approach\u2014used metal type and brass
  rules almost exclusively. The results often appear quite fresh to our 21st century
  eyes.\"</li>\r\n<li><strong>[[http://www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/gaslight_album/|Gaslight
  Style:]]</strong> \"One pronounced aspect of Victorian design was a great interest
  in creating the illusion of depth, particularly so with lithographers. Type, vignettes,
  products and design elements are made to seem multi-layered through the use of shadows,
  superimposition, dimensional banners and ribbons, turned-up faux page corners and
  choice of colors.\"</li>\r\n<li><strong>[[http://www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/typotecture.html|Typotecture:]]</strong>
  \"architectural constructions made up from letterpress type elements . . . letterpress
  printer John Kristensen of the Firefly Press in Boston . . . refers to them as \u2018typotecture.'\"</li>\r\n<li><strong>[[http://www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/type_pictures.html|Type
  Pictures:]]</strong> \"Letterpress \u2018type pictures'\u2014scenes constructed
  from metal type elements\u2014became particularly common during the 1870s and 1880s
  . . . As with all \u2018creative' arrangements of type, the quality varied. Some
  typesetters created lively and interesting scenes, while less talented workers seemed
  to have thrown together elements rather randomly.\"</li>\r\n<li>And finally, for
  something completely different, there's Dick's collection of photographs of <strong>[[http://www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/peoplefish_album/|people
