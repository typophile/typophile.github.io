  body: "Hmm. I actually did study the letter proportions of Minion a lot to make
    this font, but I certainly don't think it resembles it that much. Then again I
    designed it so the differences probably stick out more to me. Idk you tell me?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image_6374.png]"

  body: My point was to be aware as you go forward that your font needs to have an
    apparent difference to have an audience. Using Minion as a model or inspiration
    is fine - just be aware that making your font differnt enough to not be superficially
    confused with Minion is important.

    some reason isn\u2019t a match, even though it\u2019s in their database. A display

  body: Maybe a "stress" or angle to the e and o, I agree that the d and q benefit
    from swelling of the counter.
