  started working with a typeface called &#39;Scene&#39; and need a serif face to
  work alongside it - as well as being quite good for display - like Garamond. Any
  suggestions?? <BR> <BR>By the way its a consumer movie mag. <BR> <BR>Thanks!!

  body: Darren,  <BR> <BR>I think you might want to move this topic to one of the
    other forums. Here we try to ID fonts from samples, not necessarily give typographic
    advice about design questions. <BR> <BR>&#40;I tried posting an answer like this
    a while ago, but it seems to have been swallowed by the internet gods, or something.&#41;
