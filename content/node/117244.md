body: I have tried to identify this font and I have been given various names on automated
  sites but non resemble this font :)  It should be a fairly popular font as the guy
  who produced the logo is not an expert and only has basic programs.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/business_3423.PNG]

  body: Helvetica, I'm fairly certain. Although that said these aren't exactly the
    most distinctive letters possible.

  body: "I am a bit confused as I found this.\r\n\r\n\"The Helvetica\xAE typeface
    is one of the most famous and popular in the world. It\u2019s been used for every
    typographic project imaginable, not just because it is on virtually every computer.
    Helvetica is ubiquitous because it works so well.\"\r\n\r\nIts saying its on virtually
    every computer BUT its a commercial font so its not likely to be on almost every
    computer surely??\r\n\r\nIs there a free alternative?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"

  body: Popular commercial fonts like Helvetica are often licensed as basic packages
    with computer operating systems, so assuming you own the license to the software,
    you can use the font commercially and legally. And if you don't have Helvetica
    on your computer, you almost certainly have Arial, which would be extremely close
    for the letters in your sample.

  body: "_G_, _Q_, _R_, _K_, _W_, _M_, _J_ , _Y_ and _S_[which you already provided]
    work for me in telling one sans from another. For the lower case: _g_, _k_, _r_,
    _a_, _f_, _s_, _e_, _j_, and _y_. Don't need them all, but the more the better.\r\nDon"
