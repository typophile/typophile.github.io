body: Hi, I&#39;m new to these forums and I have to say, the people in this community
  are the most intelligent, creative and supportive individuals that I have ever come
  across on the web.  This place you have developed here is definately the most relevant
  and all emcompassing database for assistance, tips, etc. for type and identity that
  I have ever come across.  It&#39;s a shame that it took me years to find it, mainly
  because I had been searching for identity, logos, etc. and not typography.  I&#39;ve
  read hundreds of threads on these forums in the last 2 days and I have to say, I
  will never think about type the same again.  Thank you so much for your involvement
  in developing such a comprehensive site.  This is amazing. <BR> <BR>I run an enterprise
  software development company in Canada called Upfactor.  While I&#39;ve already
  comitted to a marketing campaign, I was wondering what some of you thought about
  the logo and typeface.  You can see the finished result at <a href="http://www.upfactor.com"
  target="_blank">www.upfactor.com</a> and when I get back to work tomorrow, I&#39;ll
  put up a larger version of the logo, business cards and letterhead. <BR> <BR>When
  I did this logo, I had a pretty hard time with it.  I must have messed around with
  50 or 60 concepts but nothing was working.  I&#39;ve tried to keep things simple
  but didn&#39;t succeed and I tried out some pretty complex designs as well.  Then,
  as a joke, I did the two white squares in the larger red square and sort of liked
  what it had going for it.  The more I tried to justify it logically, the more it
  fit, and the more I learned and read about good identities, the more confident I
  felt in my choice.   Strangely, after reading a lot of the content here, I still
  feel really good about the logo, but I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts anyway.  Please
  be very critical.  Afterall, this was an accident and I&#39;m not really a designer
  and I will never claim to be; I&#39;m a software architect :P <BR> <BR>I wanted
  to to give the established and credible representation that conveyed that we develop
  robust and timely software solutions for enterprises.  I think the edgey font and
  straight lines help convey this, at least not the opposite I hope ;&#41; <BR> <BR>The
  two white squares form an abstract arrow and it&#39;s placed in the upper right
  hand corner to synergize with the name.   <BR> <BR>These Squares also work because
  &#34;factor&#34; can be interpreted as a mathematical term and squares fit this
  concept very well, especially in cases where 2 is a factor of 4, 4 is a factor of
  16, which are perfect squares.  The reason this is relavent is because software
  development is a lot like mathematics, but even further to the non-software people
  out there, we make heavy use &#40;as in fanatical usage&#41; of a process called
  &#34;refactoring&#34;, which is basically breaking the software system down into
  the right abstractions and removing duplication throughout the system.  This is
  a lot like factoring out mathemtical equations.  This keeps the system clear, robust
  and clearly sets to define the boundaries of every component in the software system.  Again,
  squares work wondefully with these concepts I think. <BR> <BR>Secondly, a software
  system is built of many components and you can essentially break them down into
  finer-grained components.  Software components are often represented by squares
  and rectangles when illustrating the architecture of the software system.  Embedded
  squares also visualize this tangible representation. <BR> <BR>More importantly,
  however, if you read the content on our website, we advocate an agile approach to
  software development where we build software in a series of increments.  The fact
  that only part of the square is complete with white squares denotes this agile,
  lighter-weight approach.  You see, in many cases it is not desirable to build the
  entire software system up front because the requirements are unknown or they make
  change during the construction of the system.  If you only build high-value components
  and features first and deploy every 2 weeks &#40;approx.&#41;, you can deliver a
  partial, fully-tested system that is deployable today and not 2 years from now where
  it may no longer be relevant. <BR> <BR>Please let me know what you think I&#39;ve
  successfully communicated this brand.  I look very forward to hearing your responses.  If
  you know a more directed forum that I can post this message, as well as an enlarged
  logo and so on, please let me know. <BR> <BR>Best Regards, <BR>Ken

  body: My only problem is on the &#34;UPFACTOR&#34; type. That C divides the word
    in two parts. With not the regular futura &#34;C&#34;? <BR> <BR>As for the card,  I
    would go for another grid and would place the URL on white on back of it, and
    maybe skip the left color bar and get a front card more clean and effective.  <BR>

  body: I like the squares. Have you tried flipping their positions? Reading left
    to right, it looks like they&#39;re going down, not up. Just a thought, but if
    fit doesn&#39;t work that way, forget it. <BR> <BR>I think you might get a bit
    more interest out of the name if you didn&#39;t set all caps. Similarly, using
    a font with oldstyle figures could add some&#34;movement&#34;. Perhaps Legato,
    from FontShop?

  body: 'To Adriano Esteves: <BR>I never really noticed the problem with the C actually.  I&#39;m
    not sure I see it though, but I don&#39;t really have the eye for these things.  The
    font was not Futura though, it is called TW Cen MT.  At the time, I only had about
    30 fonts installed on my Java workstation and somehow this one was installed on
    it too.  I wanted to get away from using Arial/Verdana/Helvetica/Etc. because
    while they were clean and I use them on the web a lot, they just didn&#39;t look
    very unique to me.  At the time, I didn&#39;t know a lot about type and while
    I&#39;ve learned a lot in the last 2-3 days, I did this logo several months ago
    :/ <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll incorporate those changes in the business cards.  I think
    that makes some good sense actually.  The main reason for putting nothing on the
    back was more for showing off in a way because  all the business cards that I&#39;ve
    seen from our clients are rather unprofessional, but a lot of times they have
    stacks and stacks of cards and I wanted ours to stand out from the front and the
    back, but yours seem cleaner/less cluttered and makes better use of utilizing
    the back. <BR> <BR>To John: <BR>I debated back and forth on the direction of the
    squares.  The reason they are in this direction is because I see a third square
    inbetween them that forms the arrow, kind of like a stealth bomber that is an
    illusion &#40;not on purpose, but just to give you an idea on the shape I see&#41;.  Because
    chess-board squares can give these illusions and I kept staring at it, the other
    direction just looked very strange to me.  I&#39;m not really sure I should change
    it now anyway because clients already know the mark.   <BR> <BR>I think I can
    get away with some small font changes perhaps.   Now that I know a bit more about
    type, I&#39;ll check out those fonts you suggested. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help.  I&#39;ll
    put up some new versions after I work something out.'

  body: Thanks so much for your comments Hrant.  I feel more confident in my choices.  Since
    so many of you were concerned about the C, I think it&#39;s clear that I must
    change it.  I don&#39;t really see it still myself &#40;but I think that has something
    to do with my visual problem maybe&#41;, so I narrowed it per Hrant&#39;s suggestion
    to make more space between the &#34;C&#34; and the &#34;T&#34;.  I think suggestion
    works very well.  Thank you. <BR> <BR>I also made another of the business cards.  I
    really liked Adriano Esteves&#39;s version of the back so I definately want to
    keep that but I&#39;m not certain about the front of the card. One of the things
    I liked about the front was the vertical red bar.  I really like the specific
    colour of red and it reminds me of its use on the website &#40;take a look at
    <a href="http://www.upfactor.com/upfactor-web/solutions.htm" target="_blank">http://www.upfactor.com/upfactor-web/solutions.htm</a>
    and notice all that nice red whitespace where &#34;Solutions&#34; is for example&#41;.  I
    wanted to create something similar to that but I can&#39;t make it work well with
    the address text gone. <BR> <BR>Anyway, this is moving into a better direction.  I
    can see it. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/54044.gif"

    part when I exported to gif.  It&#39;s on the original though.
