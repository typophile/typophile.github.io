  particularly in need of kerning.  I did find that URW Palladio has kerned numerals.
  Why does Palladio have them, but neither Palatino nor Aldus have them?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Some fonts have proportionally spaced numerals, while others have what are
    called tabular numerals, which are monospaced so that they'll always line up in
    a column. Many OpenType fonts have both types.

  body: "No one who has ever had to do a substantial amount of typesetting would want
    to have to stop to turn on or turn off kerning just for numbers.\r\nFor display
    faces or non-tabular numbers it might be appropriate in some cases.\r\nIf you
    really want kern pairs for numbers, don't ever try and use the font to typeset
    an annual report or other document that uses columnar (tabular) numbers. It would
    look like shit to anyone who appreciates typography."

  body: "\"The combination 74 seems particularly in need of kerning.\" What, and anything
    else containing a '1' does not?\r\n\r\nGeorge nails it. Per (sensible) default,
    digits are usually designed as \"tabular lining\", so there are no jarring differences
    in width between \"11\" and \"22\". A very simple example is that of two phone
    numbers above each other.\r\n\r\nI had a nasty experience once with a Univers,
    as the version I had <em>did</em> have a lot of kerning in the digits, and suddenly
    all of my tables were off.\r\nThe reverse is also true: even <em>with</em> added
    kerning, these digits are no match for properly designed real \"proportional\"
    digits. A \"1\", for example, is typically designed to fit in the center of the
    width of digits, which means that it ought to be kerned both left and right against
    <em>all other characters</em>.\r\n\r\nProportional digits are explicitly designed
    to be used in contexts where horizontal spacing trumps vertical alignment, such
    as in running text. That also includes kerning: Robert Slimbach's Minion Pro contains
    \"tabular\" digits without any kerning, as well as \"proportional\" digits, which
    <em>do</em> contain proper kerning for your \"74\" example."

  body: Andreas, what you're misunderstanding is that the numerals aren't just not
    kerned, they're not even proportionally spaced. This means that the sidebearings
    are especially wide on 1, for example. Simply turning off kerning on numbers that
    are still proportionally spaced still won't make them line up in a table. The
    fonts that you're using are probably TrueType or PostScript, which only has one
    type of numerals built into each font. Often these font families would have multiple
    versions, one for each type of numeral, but when Microsoft or whoever licensed
    them for bundling, they only licensed the font with tabular figures because their
    business customers use their computers for spreadsheets and such. The newer Opentype
    format allows several kinds of numbers to be bundled into the same font file.

    body: "You're going to have a cell for each digit?\r\n\r\nLook at the attached
      image. All of these examples are from the same typeface, Minion Pro, which has
      multiple types of numerals built into its OpenType features. If you want the
      digits to always line up, you use tabular numerals (\"unkerned\", in your parlance),
      but if you're setting them in text, you use proportional numerals (\"kerned\").
      I also included proportional numerals with the kerning turned off, to demonstrate
      that simply turning off the kerning isn't enough to get them to line up."

    Garamond that you're looking at have tabular figures, which is why they appear
    "unkerned."

      you want. Just turn kerning on or off!

      Kerning works only when kerning is selected, so you could have both. Duh.

  body: "It's possible to design a font to work this way. I had a client who required
    proportional and tabular numerals in a legacy application that didn't support
    OpenType features. I created tabular numerals and kerned every numeral and period
    combination. That way the client, in this specific application, could activate
    tabular numerals by disabling kerning. It's not the \"proper\" way to do it but
    it worked in that case.\r\n\r\nOne big problem with this technique is the decimal
    point. If you want it to be tabular, you end up a huge gap around the period in
    your text, which will need to be kerned against almost everything else in the
    font. It sucks."

      body: Yep. And they you need an alternate comma too, for stuff like 1,000,000.
        You'll need a monospaced slash, space, brackets etc. But then its no longer
        a simpler solution than using the accepted OpenType numeral feature. OpenType
        numeral features have been around for about 20 years. Maybe it's not that
        well supported but it works in applications that professional designers use
        and they're most likely who needs tabular. If you come up with a variety of
        solutions for the problem, you practically need to read an owner's manual
        every time you switch fonts. Like, this one font has an alternate decimal,
        this other one contextually swaps for another decimal and this other one uses
        OpenType. With the standard OpenType numeral features, a designer should be
        able to switch fonts and the tabular/proportion aspect will stay intact. If
        you think proportional lining figures should be the default, I totally agree
        but only because it makes the previews look better on font vendor sites.
