  I would like to find a high quality letterpress printer (affordable is good). I
  have been to two in NYC and am not particularly impressed. I am willing to deal
  with any US printer. suggestions eagerly accepted.\r\n\r\nSecond question. I used
  a font on my website: http://www.somefortheroad.com for the logo then switched computers.
  I can not figure out what font it was I used so if anyone has any idea, it would
  be appreciated if they could share it.\r\n\r\nI hope you all have a great day and
  thanks!\r\n\r\nS"

    book, folder? How many colors? What size? What kind of stock? Folds? Will type
    be set on a computer and printed from plates? Or will you want to use metal type?
    etc, etc.\r\n\r\nThen we'll be better able to help you out.\r\n\r\ngood luck.\r\n\r\npowers"

    of discretionary income from the fray. Hopefully, it will clear out the lettepress
    wannabees, the letterpress wishabees, the letterpress awesomeabees, the letterpress
    \"impression\"ists and letterpress expressionists, the card and stationery newbies,
    the bullshit artists, the dumb fucks, etc., and just leave it the hell alone.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "Golly. I wonder where I fit into that list, Mr. Bieler. Hopefully nowhere,
    since I have nothing to lose in a recession, and my press is being left the hell
    alone, in storage, until I can figure out the time and money to set it up and
    resume where I left off a few years ago, before kids and the move to the studio-less
    home.\r\n\r\nNot sure what you're getting at with your comment, but let me take
    a stab at it...a saturated market full of mediocre printers? Or is it that you
    revere letterpress as something too precious for greeting cards and wedding invitations?
    I don't understand. "
