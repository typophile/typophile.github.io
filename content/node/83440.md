  body: "Hi Mike,\r\n\r\nMr Blaketon isn't too far off the mark but the key difference
    is the capital O. It has a very different loop. Ideally I need a match but failing
    that something a bit closer if possible.\r\n\r\nIt is quite a tricky one. I thought
    it would be fairly easy at first given it's a house-hold brand but it's proving
    harder than first thought...\r\n"

  body: "Well, I searched MyFonts for my main attempt. The other site with a lot of
    scripts is Veer. I'll have a look there. (I didn't search my Script Guide, because
    I didn't think it looked familiar to me.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "No luck at Veer or Identifont, which is hard to use for scripts. Velvet Script
    (Typadelic) and Eye Catching (BV Fonts) were the most similar.\r\n\r\nYou might
    need to consider that this might be hand-drawn or a custom font. With no repeated
    letters there is no way to prove it's a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It's possible. With it being a new typeface added to their branding however
    I would have expected it to be a font. It may very well be a custom one however.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone comes across it or recognises it at any point I'd love to put a name to
    it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help Mike."
