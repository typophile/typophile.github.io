    it using Safari, which dehqxes it automatically - I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s
    relevant.&#41;

  body: Thanks for the reply, Robin. I have SE 7.0.3 at home, which refused, so I
    downloaded 9.0-which told me the same thing. So here i am at work, with 8.0.2
    which works! I have a feeling it is my system more than anything else. <BR> <BR>Yes!
    Now I get to see what all the fuss is about!
