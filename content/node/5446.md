  body: Ok, I found a version of it  named Quicky from Opti Fonts. What is the deal
    with that foundry? I know Mark Simonson was explaining what happened to them but
    it&#39;s still a bit of a blur to me.

  body: Originally, this was a Letraset font called Quicksilver. Letraset never did
    a digital version of it that I know of. All the existing digital versions are
    knock-offs. <BR> <BR>Opti-Fonts is part of Castcraft, a fairly old Chicago printing
    firm which is known to older typophiles for its Type Films of Chicago, which marketed
    a huge library of pirated film fonts.
