  it's the same font as what they use inb the logo, but I can't find it. It looks
  similar to Dom Diagonal, but it's slightly different.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/To-Go-Sign_5008.png]"

    but this is one of the ones they use in their branding as the photo is from a
    To Go Parking sign. '

  body: "The Cambridge Fontworks rip-off, like all of theirs, still contains the PSFontName
    of what they simply renamed, in this case, all three of their Jetsam fonts contain
    the original Snyder fontnames.\r\n\r\nWSI produced some documentation with their
    fonts, usually indicating that a font was 'based on' or 'similar to' some other
    existing font. In the case of Speedy Marker, there is no such attribution. They
    DID actually create some fonts from scratch.\r\n\r\nI would hazard a guess that
    either WeatherlySystems  or Pat Snyder was the original digitization; and an even
    less-educated guess that there was no pre-digital version.\r\n\r\n - Herb V B"
