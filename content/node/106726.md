  dunno honey childs but Center and Geogrotesque are a little too close to me for
  one not to be a copy of the other... discuss [politely] amongst yourselves.\r\n\r\nMikey

    have previously published quite original fonts and it's true, there are similarities,
    but I have a feeling that each designer had a different philosophy when creating
    these fonts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sg_4802.gif]"

  body: "Here is an overlay comparison of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque/\">Geogrotesque
    Regular </a> (Eduardo Manso, 2008; in green ) and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/signal/center/\">Center
    Regular</a> (Max Phillips, 2013; in black). Both samples are screenshots from
    MyFonts. I have adjusted the spacing of Center to match Geogrotesque. The image
    is wider than the column, but I leave it the way it is, so that you can judge
    for yourself at the full resolution:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/geogrotesquecenter_4926.png]"
