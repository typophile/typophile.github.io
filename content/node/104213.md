body: "Hello\r\n         Yesterday I bought Fontlab studio 5.2.  I had messed about
  with Fontforge. But I decided to get something with more muscle for professional
  j0bs. \r\n\r\n        So about 14 hours ago I bought Fontlab Studio 5.2 after reading
  that it is the industry leader in its field. \r\n\r\n       So far. So good. But
  after installing I opened it and it asked for my serial number. I put that in. It
  said that it was right. Then Fontlab closed. Strange. But OK. I opened it again.
  The splash screen came up. Then it vanished. No program appeared. Hmm. Windows Task
  Manager showed no Fontlab process running at all. \r\n\r\n      I tried again. I
  reinstalled. No help. I restarted my PC. No help either. The FAQ list was of no
  help. Nor was the provided Fontlab manual. \r\n\r\n     So I emailed the Fontlab
  customer issues page with a critical issue request. \r\n\r\n     About 16 hours
  later after repeating the above request I've still got 2 auto emails but no help
  whatsoever. \r\n\r\n     However, with raw cunning I sorted it out. I installed
  Python 2.75 as a 32 bit MSI [even though I ma on 64 bit windows 7] and now I have
  it working. Interestingly Fontlab's GUI says \"Python is Installed\" which makes
  me think that why on earth didn't they install python FOR me in the first place.
  \r\n\r\n      So marks so far for the makers of Fontlab Studio:\r\n\r\n     Installation
  Process: D-           *Why on earth do I have to hunt for the right Python? It's
  not my job.\" \r\n     Customer Service:     F                  * Is there any?
  \ \r\n\r\n     Not good so far. I hope that I can give the product an A+   Fontlab
  is lucky that I am enough of a saint to do so if it deserves it. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

    fontlab website forum. It fails each time because there is a captcha that asks
    me to enter 2+7 =?\r\nWhen I put 9 it says error. I even tried pasting the above
    math and that doesn't work. \r\n\r\nTwo, they still haven't given me any  email
    help. \r\n\r\nTheir F grade for customer service is totally and absolutely deserved.
    It goes down as the most bizarre software experience I have had and I try out
    and but a LOT of software. It is up there with that time that I got a trial of
    XSI Softimage and it wouldn't work. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Yes, http://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio/ is the best choice but Summer
    seems to be a vacation time so response is slow.  There is plenty of "Loading
    FontLab"stuff in older responses there so you should be able to search and find
    a ready answer.  Be sure to check the Windows version specifically since Mac has
    different issues to deal with than PC.

    body: Yes, Hrant, and there is a huge amount of work involved in porting so don't
      be too hard on the programmers.  This is not a trivial task.  It also requires
      that they then support both platforms forever. Perhaps you might lead an effort
      to fund the porting effort for the software of your choice so that the developers
      don't starve while they are being so magnanimous? ;-)

  body: "I don't know about the internals (*), but Glyph's unique look-and-feel comes
    from some <em>heavily</em> utilizing native Mac OS X components.\r\nIt would need
    not as much \"porting\" or \"re-writing\", but rather first finding out how these
    components actually work; and then you need to find a way to implement similar
    features on Windows or Linux.\r\n\r\n(*) It can be expected that <em>wherever
    possible</em> its programmers would use native Mac components, even for \"internal\"
    stuff. Suppose OS X contains a native OpenType Feature compiler -- why create
    one yourself? .. Except that you won't get the same \"for free\" on Windows.\r\n\r\nAdobe
    tried to circumvent the whole UI porting problem by programming their own interface,
    freely borrowing ideas from both Mac and Windows. Alas, it handles as bad as Windows
    1.0 once did."

    a reply [finally] from one of the developers [alex petrov] to my critical request.
    I have responded to him and our discussion is ongoing. \r\n\r\nSo installation
    process still = D - \r\n\r\nCustomer service = C    [I suppose that there is some].
    \r\n\r\nNonetheless this was still a disappointing piece of software. I have told
    them that despite Fontlab working at face value, I had no way of knowing if python
    2.75 was a stable version of python for this software. "

    earth do you reach any conclusion  about my opinions such that \"that most of
    us on Typophile do not share your opinion\". ? \r\n\r\nHave you done a survey?
    Have you asked people? I would expect that as in any forum there would be people
    with a variety of backgrounds, experiences and beliefs that lead to different
    opinions. Indeed, there was an expression of cynicism towards Fontlab earlier
    in this forum. In it doubt was expressed about me getting a  refund:\r\n\r\n\"(I
    assume the OP's two whines constitute enough discussion. He could always ask for
    a refund -- though since FontLab is a what, 10-pesron company spread out over

    ELLERSTON! \r\n\r\nClap. Clap. Clap. Isn't it cute when you can use someone's
    own quote against them. I mean, Charles my friend, please avoid any legal courtroom
    career whatsoever. \r\n\r\nAnyway, to continue my points. I have been absolutely
    fair to Fontlab. I have given one opinion about their customer service and I have
    changed it upon their service improving for me, namely that they have given me
    a refund. If their developer tells me something better about the installation
    process I may increase that grade also. \r\n\r\nThat is something entirely different
    from whining, whingeing or any other related verb. Rather, I have engaged in a
    constructive, factual, experiential process. \r\n\r\nActually let's define whining
    with a dictionary:\r\n\r\n\r\nverb (used without object)\r\n1.\r\nto utter a low,
    usually nasal, complaining cry or sound, as from uneasiness, discontent, peevishness,
    etc.: The puppies were whining from hunger.\r\n2.\r\nto snivel or complain in
    a peevish, self-pitying way: He is always whining about his problems.\r\nverb
    (used with object)\r\n3.\r\nto utter with or as if with a whine: I whined my litany
    of complaints.\r\nnoun\r\n4.\r\na whining utterance, sound, or tone.\r\n5.\r\na
    feeble, peevish complaint.\r\nOrigin:\r\nbefore 1150; Middle English whinen (v.),
    Old English hw\u012Bnan to whiz; cognate with Old Norse hv\u012Bna \r\n************\r\nMy
    constructive posts here are totally at odds with the defin ition above. \r\n\r\nRunning
    scared now eh? I'm a guy who guys to the dictionary and uses my brains. \r\n\r\nYou.
