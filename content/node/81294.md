  body: "I died a little when I saw this.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of a time a few weeks
    ago when I was driving by the refineries, and they used Comic Sans as their typeface
    for the digital screen outside their gates that tells the time, date, weather/temperature
    and other assorted messages.  \r\n\r\nThe greater irony here is that this company
    is worth billions and probably have a group of \"experts\" in charge of advertising...
    Shame."

    The boxes may be turnkey ones on which they're not allowed to install other software
    or even other fonts.\r\n\r\nAs for Susan Lucci's website: by using a standard
    Windows typeface, her site is accessible in standard browsers without fancy plug-ins.
    And, in fact, from the limited set of typefaces available, I can even argue that
    she made an <em>appropriate</em> use of Comic Sans - as an informal face to give
    the effect of hand lettering on a blackboard.\r\n\r\nIt's not often Comic Sans
    is used appropriately - and there would have been better faces to use if she had
    used a technology for her site that gave her more typographic control - but I'd
    say this is one of the few cases where this was pulled off."

    screens with the time and weather at their refinery gates. And if  they do, they'd
    have enough to do already without taking on the headache of getting the folks
    at the refinery to care what the 'big-city advertising experts' think about their
    taste in typography. \r\n\r\n\r\n... & pages of day time TV stars were never the
    place to look for inspired design.  :o) \r\n"

  body: "... for a certain value of \"appropriate\".\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be better
    to say that this particular use of Comic Sans is merely Papyrus bad instead of
    Comic Sans bad. That would more accurately express my view of that web page from
    a typographical standpoint, and thus avoid appearing to take a shocking and outrageous
    position that might be construed as trolling."
