  but none are better than a 75% match. \r\n\r\nHere is the image sample:\r\nhttp://www.dognmoon.com/corey/mersoleiltypeface.jpg\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nLooking
  more closely, it looks as if the type size and vertical orientation has been manipulated,
  but it looks like the typeface is actually a font and not hand-lettering. (?)    Additionally,
  one of the giveaways is in the copy, the word \"atypical\" has no corrective kerning
  between the \"t\" and the \"y\". If this had been hand-lettered, that most likely
  would've been remedied.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for this forum. Im glad I found it.
