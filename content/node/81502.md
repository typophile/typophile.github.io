  body: The odd placement of the crossbars on the f and t lead me to believe that
    some serious fiddling has gone on, including a certain amount of vertical stretching..

  body: It's an old face called Binderstile. There were three weights--Medium, Bold,
    and Heavy. This appears to be Binderstile Bold. I am not aware of a digital version.
    (BTW, this is how it looks straight out of the box--no fiddling was done.)

    based on your info. Binder Style seems to be from 1959 by J. Binder.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/binderstile_4696_4037.gif]"
