  fonts. As an example Fat Love <a=\"http://www.devlounge.net/articles/30-fonts-you-want-to-have>here</a>
  is of the type I am looking for, but when I follow the link I cannot locate it.
  Also I'm not mad about the slanty v's and a's. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fatlove_4269.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n(if
  poss. free as well!).\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nJim."

    over on the Adobe Photoshop forum found that the text engine in that program locked
    up totally after he installed a free font. It took hours for him to find out the
    problem, and then expunge said font (he had loaded hundreds at once).\r\n\r\nI
    don't know what he considers his time to be worth, but to me that was a very expensive
    free font."

  body: Great point, Don. It's easy to forget that fonts are software and you wouldn't
    install questionable software on your working computer. Besides being built of
    more reliable code, commercial fonts also come with free support and that can
    be vital when you run into issues on a deadline.

  body: "I'd wager that somewhere there is a tale of a pay font hanging up someone's
    system too.\r\n\r\nI have always worked mainly with free fonts, and never had
    a hang-up I could trace to a font. Well maybe before XP; anything could happen
    back then with Windows. The boogey-man was always just around the corner.\r\n\r\nThe
    real frustration with free fonts for me is suddenly realizing you need some characters
    that aren't there. Or odd behavior when put on vector curves. Or real bad spacing
    that requires some time spent adjusting. Or something is just 'off' when you are
    finished, and you can't seem to make it fly.\r\n\r\nSometimes I actually enjoy
    the challenge of making a quality-challenged font look its best, but then I realize
    it is a kind of false advertising, so I won't go too far with this.\r\n\r\nGiven
    the choice, and the ability to charge it to someone, I'd go with pay fonts most
    of the time. Just less surprises, on the whole. \r\n\r\nI imagine, if a font is
    well made, you might never realize the quality. It is lack of quality that is
    easy to focus in on, as a rule. And I get to see plenty of that. But for free,
    I can't complain (too much, anyway).\r\n\r\nAnd occasionally I have worked with
    a font that made me ooh and aah when using it. Now that is worth money."

    a problem on a pay font  (bad spacing), the designer was very responsive and gave
    me a couple more fonts (someday I am going to have to try and find what I did
    with them). It was a gratifying experience. I just wish I could choose over, since
    my tastes have changed away from gimmicky display fonts since then."
