body: so i'm looking on the net for the history of the font "runic condensed" cuz
  i'm a fan of the videogame series "final fantasy" and i can't find any mention of
  the rest of the font family. why is "condensed" the only style of "runic mt" to
  be digitized and what happened to the rest of the family??

    Fantasy?

  body: "There are two typefaces in the Stephenson, Blake & Co specimen, third edition
    (ca. 1920s) that have the appellation of \"Runic.\" One is called Lining Bold
    Runic; the other is Lining Runic Elongated. Monotype's Runic Condensed is closely
    related to the latter. But these weren't a unified family and have only some shared
    stylistic traits. \r\n\r\nThe concept of a unified family of weights and widths
    was only just taking shape at that time period and was not all-pervasive. Off-beat
    styles like this didn't usually get the \"family treatment.\"\r\n\r\nSo I doubt
    that Monotype ever had a unified family of Runic styles. I believe there was only
    ever this one.\r\n\r\nWhy the \"Condensed\" in the name? I believe that Runic
    was used as a generic style designation -- like Latin or Egyptian. So this is
    Monotype's interpretation of a condensed, Runic-style typeface. \r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
