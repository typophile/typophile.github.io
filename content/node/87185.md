  body: "It looks like Fairfield. Try <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/fairfield_std_complete_pack/\">Fairfield</a>
    from Linotype (The capital U doesn\u2019t match), <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/fairfield_std_complete_pack/\">Transitional

  body: I think Fanwood is a match, an excellent recasting of Rudolf Ruzicka's Fairfield.
    Thanks a lot for identifying it. And I was able to download it from The League
    of Moveable Type too.
