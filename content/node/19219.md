  were able to open an existing PS or TT font and make versions of them, applying
  Deltas (hinting operation). Something like a Multiple Master, but Single Master.\r\nIt
  would be nice to get some demo or screen shots for my PHD thesis.\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDaniel"

    \u2014 Delta(s) is only a hinting operation in the narrow confines of TT hinting.
    In IP and GX, it was, with the addition of Interpolation of the \"untouched\"
    points, a quick and remarkably efficient means of transforming an outline for
    high resolution output."

    by doing interpolation (I have a demo and that's my impression), so masters were
    needed (different versions have more and more options=new masters added).\r\nIP
    and GX are more interesting, because they are single master, and I understand
    they were dangerous for the market.\r\nCan we get some images or samples of letters

    which is sort of the oxygen of computer assisted style manipulation, grid fitting
    and things beyond. \r\n\r\nCameleon worked by having a small set of very complex
    contours, masters took up 50-100k per font (I think), and there were several of
    these; for serif, sans, italic, etc., and then a 5k descriptor file for each discrete
    style from a particular master. You could, of course, interpolate to anywhere
    within, (but not between) the masters, and create your own 5k style descriptor.\r\n\r\nIncubator

    know this already\u2026\r\n\r\nYou can create your own images of GX variations
    fonts in the drawing program Intaglio. Set some text and choose Skia from the
    fonts pallette. Instances and variations sliders appear in the Typography Panel,
    which is accessed from the 'gear' icon. MM fonts work in the same way as GX Variations\u2014just
    drag the sliders.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, install the X-Code tools and go to Developer>Examples>ATSUI>Font
    Panel Support and compile the sample program 'ATSUIFontPanelDemo'. Several other
    example apps also display GX Features and Variations.\r\n\r\nIf you have the OSX
    'Classic' environment installed, or you have a pre-OSX Mac with System 7, OS8
    or OS9, download LightningDraw Lite. The GXGraphics extension, which supplies
    the GX Variations functionality, is installed with LightningDraw (it's part of
    the installer). \r\n____________________________\r\n\r\nAbout Incubator GX (I've
    not used it as haven't been able to find it, legally or otherwise); \r\n\r\nhttp://www.truetype.demon.co.uk/truetype/sampo.htm\r\nThis
    page says Sampo Kaasila of Type Solutions created Incubator GX and TypeMan GX
    (a hinting tool), but they were later discontinued due to a lack of interest from
    the market. This is bizarre; the first GX applications didn't arrive until 1995!\r\n____________________________\r\n\r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20010104101800/webcom.net/~nfhome/fontgen.htm\r\nThis
    page says that Incubator did things that Font Chameleon could not do. At the end
    of the piece it says that Bitstream bought Type Solutions in December 1998.\r\n____________________________\r\n\r\nAccording
    to a Seybold Report from 1993, Incubator GX could automatically produce multiple
    axis GX fonts from a single input\u2014in other words, GX Variations fonts. \r\n____________________________\r\n\r\nDavid:
    \r\n<Incubator Pro, I don\u2019t remember that much as it was a quick quack between
    MM and GX, before GX \u201Cwon.\u201D>\r\nCould you expand on this? Did Incubator
    work? Was it able to create Variations? How were the Skia variations created?"

    Incubator worked well with slight variations, alas DELTA instructions were applied.
    Heavy conversions require bigger changes in the letterform and masters/interpolation
    have better results.\r\nIt makes sense to me."

  body: "David, \r\n\r\nGX variations are \"dying supported\". You can't get them
    in a normal Cocoa application such as Keynote, Pages or TextEdit. You need to
    make direct ATSUI calls from a Mac OS X applications, which almost nobody \u2013
    most people use the Cocoa text framework. There is a demo ATSUI application on
    the Mac OS X developers pack which allows you to see the Skia GX variations but
    that's about it. There used to be a small text editor called WorldText that supported
    the variations. It was included in the developers pack of Mac OS X but I was not
    able to find it in OS X 10.4. I tried running an older copy of WorldText on my
    10.4 system but it crashed. So the support for GX variations is practically non-existent,
    from the user point of view. \r\n\r\nA."

    This wasn't suppled with 10.4, but it was with previous versions of OSX. The framework
    goes in; \r\nMacintosh HD>System>Library>PrivateFrameworks>PowerPlant.framework\r\n\r\nThe
    OSX drawing app Intaglio supports GX/MM Variations and Instances via two extra
    features in the Typography Panel. \r\n\r\nIntaglio, WorldText and the X-code example
    ATSUIFontPanelDemo, also display an extra menu, 'Extra Position Controls', which
    consists of three features; 'Add Space Before Characters', Add Space After Characters'
    and 'Shift Text Baseline'. The first two features enable letterspacing and leading
    to be changed either by moving a slider or by typing a numeral in a box. This
    works with letters, words, lines or paragraphs. \r\n\r\nHow 'Shift Text Baseline'
    works depends on the font. With most fonts, space is added between each line and
    between paragraphs, but with Skia, the space is added between paragraphs and the
    last line in paragraphs is also changed. Something is wrong here\u2014maybe this
    was corrected in OS 10.4.6? \r\n\r\nThe Font Panel doesn't always work properly.
    If you choose a different font, WorldText ignores the change. This can be solved
    by opening a new document.\r\n\r\nSeveral more X-code samples (including MLTE
    Showcase and TypeServicesForUnicode) also support Variations to one degree or
    another, but their implementations and interfaces are different from Text Edit."
