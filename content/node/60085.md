  looking for this font which was a font recently used for an album released by a
  Korean girl group called Girls' Generation. I've found a similar font family with
  the name \"To Be Continued\" but the pictures & that font don't seem to match up
  quite exactly.~~\r\n\r\nP.S. ughh.. didnt know how to move a forum since I posted
  this in the wrong one. :/\r\nanyways I'm new here and I think this place is a great
  way to learn about different fonts & discover new ones. :))\r\nooh..& sorry about
  the big pic size, dont know how to resize..EEk!!"

  body: Looks like the original series Star Trek font to me. Bitstream has a version
    called [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/horizon/|Horizon]] but you could
    probably find something free at a fan site.
