  - Charles P. Allen High School, Bedford, NS, Canada]]\r\n\r\nI need to edit the
  text in this logo, but the psd I have to work with only has the text as objects
  as opposed to formattable text that can be changed with PS's text tool.\r\n\r\nIf
  I can figure out the particular font being used here, I can delete the parts I don't
  need and add new elements using the hex colour codes for existing elements.\r\n\r\nAny
  help you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks all!"
