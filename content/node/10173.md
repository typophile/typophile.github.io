  target="_blank">http://www.kringelbach.dk/papers/NI_Pammer2004.pdf</a> <BR>takes
  the discussion of the &#39;visual word form area&#39; referenced in my _Typo#13_
  contribution significantly further than McCandliss, et. al., &#40;see my footnote
  #32&#41;. The interesting results, from a perceptual processing in reading point
  of view, are on pdf page 3 &#40;1821&#41;. The &#39;discussion&#39; is framed according
  to a &#39;letter recognitional&#39; model of word recognition, so my conclusions--favouring
  a more direct &#39;visual wordform resolutional&#39; model--might look somewhat
  different than those of the authors. But I post this here, because the &#39;understanding
  reading&#39; discussion Hrant champions must be engaged at this level if we want
  to go beyond &#39;intuitive confidence&#39; to &#39;grounded beliefs&#39;. <BR>
  <BR>Also important to this end might be the paper at this link: <BR><a href="http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/palmeri/vita/pwg04-tics.pdf"

  <BR>The paper provides a nice map of the presumed stages of visual information processing
  &#40;and an interesting chart of &#39;representational changes&#39; occurring with
  the development of perceptual expertise&#41;.  <BR>I include the link because of
  Hrant&#39;s earlier comments about where Kevin, Hrant and I stand in relation to
  each other. As I understand it Hrant differs from Kevin and myself in placing much
  &#40;about 66%&#41; of the burden of perceptual processing in reading on the far
  right path &#40;relative to parafoveal material&#41;. Kevin and I take a greater
  interest in what happens on the left path &#40;heading off of the retinal image&#41;
  in central vision. Kevin and I diverge in our understanding of what happens at the
  &#39;component-tuned units&#39; level and beyond.  <BR>My previous post was an attempt
  to fill out my notion of what happens to &#39;word[s] n&#43;1&#39; when &#39;word
  n&#39; is in central vision &#40;and I had to sharpen somewhat my view of the left-hand
  side processes&#41;. <BR>The first paper linked to in this post focuses closely
  on the areas where Kevin and I diverge.'
