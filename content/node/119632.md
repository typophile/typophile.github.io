  Should this be\r\n\r\n- \u201CLAGRANGian\u201D (wrong Name highlighted)\r\n- \u201CLAGRANGEian\u201D
  (wrong word in the end)\r\n- \u201CLagrangian\u201D (exception of the rule, since
  name is no full substring)?\r\n\r\nSimilarly \u201Cfermion\u201D from Fermi, \u201Cboson\u201D
  from Bose.\r\n"

  body: In your example, "Hilbert" it's not semantically a name, so you don't need
    to apply whatever style you choose for proper names (more so for the others).

    or whatever) do the entire word or it may look weird. Your readers should be smart
    enough to figure it out. And you certainly don't want to misspell a word, it'll
    be an obvious mistake.\r\n\r\nAnother approach might be to rewrite the sentence
    so the name stands by itself without \"...ian\"."

  body: "I am no fan of such a use of smallcaps (worse with mixed caps) but if you
    insist, you can take advantage of the fact that in the OED online, the form Lagrangean
    is also accepted. There are two references, one with the meaning you may have
    in mind:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n1870   <em>Rep. Brit. Assoc. Advancem. Sci. 1869</em>
    ii. 10   Equations of motion in the Lagrangean form.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "\"I would like to use small capitals for the names in my document.\"\r\n\r\nWhy?
    Perhaps an answer to this first question will suggest an answer to the question
    of what to do with the eponyms. Without further context, I would say emphasize
    only actual names, not other words thence derived."

  body: "Regarding the \u201CWhy?\u201D:\r\nI saw it in lecture notes and found it
    quite nice. Then I read a bit about it and found that it is not uncommon, at least.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I change the words in order to get the full name into them, this probably does
    more damage for the reader than the small caps help. So I would rather do no more
    small caps then, since words like \u201Cboson\u201D and \u201Clagrangian\u201D
    would break that pattern. And consistency is key for a thing like this."

  body: Another option might be to insert subheads before those paragraphs which call
    out the names. But I'd probably use subheads throughout the paper, both for consistency
    and also to help identify the various sections.

  body: "I second that either only true references to people using their proper names
    be set in small caps, or else the entire word in its altered spelling be highlighted.\r\n\r\nPutting
    only part of a name in small caps is certainly unsightly."
