  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Is it just me, or have these faces survived the translation to digital? The current versions of Poliphilus and Blado (Monotype) seem to preserve most of the charm of the originals - at least in comparison to the current wispy digitization of say, Bembo, unless we&rsquo;re talking about Bembo-Book or Aetna.</p>
<p>Perhaps Poliphilus and Blado could be a little fatter here and there, but I do get the overall impression of inkspread-like thickness. I suppose they were fairly heavy to begin with, a characteristic which serves them well now. More than just a vestigal tail.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ve been ogling Igino Marini&rsquo;s Fell Revivals more than I should: <a href="http://www.iginomarini.com/fell.html">http://www.iginomarini.com/fell.html</a>. And they&rsquo;re free, too.</p>

<p>Poliphilus and Blado are really fine designs but 98% historic (or really close) revivals are not the big thing. :-)</p>

<p>Yes, Poliphilus was copied from the actual face as it appeared on paper. Even the ink spread was reproduced, giving the font a rough and beautiful quality. An ambitious idea, to be sure, but it doesn&rsquo;t appeal to everyone. Still, I&rsquo;d certainly choose Poliphilus over the weak and anemic Bembo, Perpetua, and Centaur we have in digital form today. Many of the classics reproduced in digital form today lack that meaty, dark quality that characterized printed matter of the past. Ink pressing into paper versus inkjets and laser.</p>
<p>There are, however, notable exceptions: Dante, Bulmer, Miller, Elzevir, Fleischmann, etc. DTL Elzevir and DTL Dorian are exceptionally well done.</p>

<p>Of course yes. There are several reasons why modern classics look so even, perfect?, sharp and often thin compared to the old ones.</p>
<ol>
<li>time is todays cost factor one</li>
<li>large pointsizes are easier to draw and often printed in specimens</li>
<li>digitization is often a copy and paste or master and slave thing, the little differences will be equalised</li>
<li>the ink spread, what make sharp metal contours look round, will not be calculated for the text design</li>
<li>but sharp type look better on screen</li>
<li>today we have an other taste in these things too</li>
</ol>
<p>If you like a certain metal type design and you begin to collect printed material on it from different print sources, you will see very different gray scales and ink spread situations, depending on the ink, the press, the paper the craftmenship and of course, the freshness of the types. Sometimes even the very dark prints of the same type have its quality and taste. So, an historical, preserving digitization is not really posssible. You can try to come close but it will always be a new design.</p>

<p>I thoroughly agree, and I&rsquo;m always looking for these kinds of typefaces. I&rsquo;ve often used newspaper typefaces for book projects (the Linotype legibility series, Matthew Carter&rsquo;s Fenway). I&rsquo;ve very happy that Monotype released Bembo Book now &ndash; the old regular cut was always too light for me. I don&rsquo;t mind clean-polished outlines at all &ndash; on the contrary. When the curves are drawn right and have some beautiful inner tension (I was recently smashed away after I&rsquo;ve taken a close look at Carter&rsquo;s Big Figgins Italic), I sometimes use enlarged excerpts of letterforms as graphic elements. I&rsquo;ve only recently made the link in my mind between the overall quality of type that I like and certain specific features that influence it. I&rsquo;ve known one such element for a long time now, and it was &ndash; darkness. For my own personal taste, Monotype Plantin is just the precisely right degree of color on the page (when used in book sizes). I&rsquo;m glad to see that some designers are now beginning to draw optical sizes again!</p>
