body: "hey everyone, \r\n\r\ni would love to get my hands on two of the fonts that
  came with FUSE 15 magazine: F DIY (foundations and skeletons) by Peter Grundy and
  F Bits by Paul Elliman...\r\n\r\ni read that the fonts that came with the mag were
  to be considered work in progress and the idea was that the fonts that came with
  the mag were experimental freeware and should be freely built upon, expanded ect....if
  this is not the case i apologise in advance, im not trying cheat or rip off anyone,
  i am simply ignorant / misinformed and if these have been released commercially
  please can someone tell me where i can purchase them... if however they are above
  board freeware can someone share them? also, if they are freeware, what are the
  terms i.e only for personal use or also commercial? \r\n\r\nonce again, i know how
  sensitive the issue of sharing fonts is, i am NOT asking anyone to share anything
  illegally, or violate the terms of the mag... \r\n\r\n"
