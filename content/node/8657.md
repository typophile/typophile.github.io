  body: When you say &#39;similar&#39;, what in particular would you want to be like
    Quadraat? I think of stroke and letterforms as making a font similar, but are
    there particular letters that you like in Quadraat? How close does it have to
    be? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think a list of fonts by the same designer is going to
    be very much help, because usually a designer explores different styles in different
    fonts. <BR> <BR>If we had some idea what it is that you like most in Quadraat,
    maybe it would be easier to make suggestions.

  body: A lot of the look and feel of Quadraat has to to with it&#39;s designers&#39;
    views on type production &#40;now and in the past&#41;.  <BR>Fred Smeijers has
    produced a wonderful little book &#40;Counterpunch&#41; about this -- you may
    want to check it out. It will make quite clear why Quadraat is a unique typeface.
    And why it&#39;s gonna be hard to find similar typefaces. <BR>&#40;I&#39;m biased,
    I know. I&#39;ve used Quadraat for a pet project, some time ago, and am completely
    smitten with it&#41;.

  body: I&#39;m a compositor and I just got a new journal, which has been set in Quadraat
    for years. The press I work for cannot use Quadraat legally and I have been asked
    to find something new, something that will come pretty close to matching, since
    there will be no new design. This is something I rarely do in my job and I&#39;m
    finding it difficult. So, when I say similar, I guess I do mean stroke and letterforms,
    and possibly especially the way that Quadraat italic looks. Sorry, I know I&#39;m
    out of my element here!
