  alternative, but something similar to Brauer. If anyone has some recommendations,
  that would be great. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nAaron"

  body: "Hmm... I doubt you'll find many other semi-condensed, squared, slightly rounded
    grotesques with chopped-off \"t\" and \"f\" left crossbars and hanging \"r\".
    Why not use the real thing, if you have specific needs? \r\nWhich aspect of Brauer
    Neue is important? If you're looking for squareness and slight condensation, try
    FTF Flama Condensed or DIN Condensed (Not FF DIN). For rounded corners, try AG
    Book Rounded, though that's a lot rounder. "

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions Satyagraha. It was the slightly rounded-ness similarities
    that I was after. I would love to use Brauer, but it's been popping up everywhere
    of late around here (melbourne) so was just tying to find something else that
    had that warm but solid feel to it. \r\n\r\n"
