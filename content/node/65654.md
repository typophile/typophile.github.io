body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project at the moment that features a lot of references.
  However, I'm really restricted on space and I was hoping to save as much of it as
  possible.\r\n\r\nThere are a few references that are repeated, so I was wondering
  what the rules are for using the same reference indicator throughout for the same
  reference. It seems logical and fine to me, but I never know if I'm breaking some
  age-old cardinal sin by doing such things.\r\n\r\nFor example the text would look
  like this (references are in parenthesis as I can't get superscript in web forms
  like this):\r\n\r\n<cite>Tony Blair said on the 25th February 2003 that \u201CThe
  purpose in our acting is disarmament\u201D(8) when justifying the UK\u2019s involvement
  in the Iraq war. Since then it has become clear from leaked memos (which can be
  found on government websites) and evidence given to the Chilcott inquiry that Tony
  Blair\u2019s real reason for the invasion was regime change,(9) which is illegal
  under international law. If Tony Blair took the UK to war knowing that the reason
  behind his decision was regime change in allegiance with the USA then he is an architect
  of an illegal war that has seen 100\u2019000 Iraqi civilians dead as well as 179
  British troops killed there since 2003.(8) </cite>\r\n\r\n\r\nIs that ok or should
  I keep the indicators progressing and repeat the references in the list at the end?\r\n\r\nAny
  help on this would be gratefully received as always.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJono \r\n\r\n(all

    is fine, not odd or anything. It's clear to a casual reader you are referring
    to the same source again.

    that work is cited twenty times, do we want nineteen identical references all

    some variant of Vancouver references, rather than Harvard), we'd just repeat the

    we don't have to jump when Chicago says jump. ;-) \r\n\r\nKent, I guess the nearest
    UK equivalent would be something like the <em>Oxford Guide to Style</em> (or <em>New

  body: "I do note (a pun!) a possible source for the confusion between the two standard
    lists at the end of a journal article.\r\n\r\nJono <em>describes</em> a reference
    from a full reference list, which may be referred to in any number of ways (de
    Jong, 2009). Or [1]. Or (2), which, by the way, may be confused with (1) an inline,
    (2) enumerated, (3) list of statements. But as he said, there seems to be a lack
    of space and an abundance of references, which leads to another possible way of
    referring.\xB2\r\n\r\nThis ought not be confused with endnotes. Endnotes should
    always appear consecutively, in their logical order. It <em>is</em> possible to
    put references into endnotes, but then you are bound by their nature.\r\n\r\nFrom
    his wording, I understood Jono to have a regular references list at the end of
    each article, enumerated rather than called upon by name, and if so, there is
    no harm in repeating and out-of-order numbers. However, as <em>usually</em> superscript
    numbers denote notes, it might be confusing for the reader, and I'd personally
    advise against these and use square brackets."

    advantages in some texts. For example, if I'm writing an article referencing another
    article I might want to cite a note in that article by number. Or if I'm discussing
    a text with students, it would be handy to be able to refer to citations by unique
    number.\r\nIn the academic writing with which I'm most familiar, most notes will
    include specific page numbers (or additional information) which won't likely be
    the same for every reference made by the text. \r\nAdditionally, though I acknowledge
    the reptition may seem wasteful, it can be handy to get a sense of the proportion
    of reliance on a given source for information backing up an argument, which would
    be less obvious if references kept directing back to a single note. \r\n\r\nI
    won't necessarily go to the mat defending all US academic formatting practices
    - there is a much about them that is annoying or illogical - but in this case
    I appreciate the usefulness of consecutively numbered references. \r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I wrote all that before I carefully read Theunis's post, which makes a helpful
    distinction."

  body: "If Jono's extract reflects the actual subject matter of the project in question,
    I'd certainly second what Theunis said about \"any number of ways (de Jong, 2009)\"
    \u2013 which would end with references listed alphabetically by author (the Harvard
    style); it does make it easier to cite specific pages, notes etc (Williams, 2009:
    18\u201320; de Jong, 2009: n3), and is popular in social-science subjects (we
    certainly use it on our politics titles). \r\n\r\nIndeed the numbered Vancouver
    style <em>does</em> mean you have to be very careful with reference marks if there
    are to be both references and notes. (Not sure about \"<em>usually</em> superscript
    numbers denote notes\", but I can only speak from the publications I actually
    see day-to-day of course...)\r\n\r\nSo assuming Jono's project is entirely style-it-yourself
    (rather than needing to conform to someone else's pre-set style), the practical
    answer is to use whatever best suits the length of the document, number of references,
    number of multiple citations, number of other-note-types, and space constraints,
    so long as it's obvious to the reader what's going on.\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nSeems I've started quite a debate here. What I should have
    said is that this is not an academic project referencing journals etc, and that
    it is indeed style-it-yourself. However, it will be entered into an ISTD competition
    so I want it to be spot on typographically. I'm mostly referencing online news
    stories and newspaper articles so quoting the authors name and year in brackets
    wouldn't really work as a fair few of the articles are written anonymously on
    news websites. \r\n\r\nI think I'm going to go with superscripted numbers in consecutive
    order as it looks neatest and seems to be quite conventional. There are only a
    couple of references that are repeated so using a system where it was 'See 3'
    for repeated references doesn't look bad at all, it just uses a little more space
    than usual, but I've found a way around that now anyway so it's all good.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your help on this guys."
