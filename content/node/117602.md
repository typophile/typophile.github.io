  body: "The lowercase in Germania and similar fonts may be adapted from a blackletter
    design by William H. Bradley in 1894 for the Inland Printer. By 1897 the imitations
    with minor variations by otherfoundries was a source of strong comment in the
    Inland Printer. I suspect that \"Germania\" et. al was a production of BB&S, but
    will have to check. The original is available in digital form in Ralph Unger's
    Bradley http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/bradley/\r\nDon\r\nNote: corrected
    post."

  body: "Many thanks Mike! A veritable flood of copycats with minor variations. I
    wonder how many he missed? Do you have any information on the intrepid researcher
    Bernhard Schnelle?\r\nThe \"Germania\" variation is in Dan X. Solo's catalog at
    page 109.\r\nI don't know if \"Germania\" dates from circa 1900 -- nothing on
    this variation in Petzendorfer's big Schriften Atlas of 1898 or Phillips Old Fashioned
    Type Book of 1945 -- or whether it was another kick at the can from a lettering
    artist in the photo-type era. Many but not all of the fonts in the big Solo Catalog
    were metal. This variation never made it into the Letraset catalog. Out of curiosity
    I will flip though the big Photo Lettering catalog when I next visit my local
    university library.\r\nIf all else fails I can have a drink of Ketel One vodka\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KetelOneSM_5389.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "I standardized the the scale of Jim Fordyce's Deutsch Gothic of 1994 and
    Dieter Steffmann's Germania and compared several glyphs. I found that the outlines
    of the Germania glyphs are point for point identical with those of Deutsch Gothic.
    I conclude that Germania is a clone of Deutsch Gothic, but note that some glyphs
    have been added to supplement the basic alphabet. I have not seen Dabblet, but
    given the stated date, I suspect that it is an original digitization.  I suspect
    that with the exception of Deutsch Gothic and/or Dabblet, all of the others on
    the well researched list provided by Fivos, are clones.\r\nDon"

  body: "Mike, Puns R us...\r\nI agree Jim Fordyce broke new ground. To bad he left
    no provenance notes. I don't know how old he was in 1994, but the clock is ticking
    for all of us. I hope he is alive and in good health. Google Jim Fordyce font
    maker and all that pops up are links to his fonts.\r\nDon"

  body: "Don - I do not have any info on Herr Schnelle (other than that he must be
    quick. Schnell? ... sorry).\r\n\r\nJim Fordyce's fonts were some of the earliest
    digital revivals. Quality wasn't perfect, but pretty darn good for the early 90's.
    I tried to hunt him up to inquire about the source for Germania, but had no luck."
