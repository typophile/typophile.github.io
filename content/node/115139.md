  body: "Tiny image, but I recognize the idea. Looks like an engraved version of a
    common 19th century design style. There is a shortage of digital fonts with both
    this heavy weight and horizontal line engraved treatment. \r\nThe closest digital
    is Archive Garfield http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/archivetype/archive-garfield/
    \ It is a poor substitute -- too light and with only an autotrace quality. \r\nEven
    lighter, but a well executed horizontal line engraved treatment Chevalier http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/chevalier-lt/\r\nThere
    is a similar font of very heavy weight: Roman Ornamented http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/roman-ornamented/
    But, like Archive Garfield it has only an autotrace quality.\r\nA different design,
    but also an authentic alternative: Archive Copperplate Head http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/archivetype/archive-copperplate-head/
    But, like Archive Garfield it has only an autotrace quality.\r\nYet another design,
    Batista Stroke by Ingo Preuss  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/preusstype/battista/
    has a well executed horizontal line engraved treatment \r\nDon"
