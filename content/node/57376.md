    it may use (1) the OS engine, for example ClearType on Windows, or (2) a built-in
    drawing engine -- Safari on Windows springs to mind, as this has been heavily
    commented on (primarily by Windows users, I probably should add). [[http://www.w3.org/Amaya|Amaya]]

  body: ">web developers cannot change this setting which I agree is how it should
    be\r\nShould the developer of a single web site be able to control the appearance
    of all sites on a user's machine regardless of the user's settings, or just  the
    appearance of their site?\r\n\r\nI agree, that this situation is nearly hopeless
    for design, and readability, because the reality is the user doesn't really control
    much of anything, OS don't control nearly enough of what they claim to control,
    and browsers, which should have their own rendering (and perhaps fonts), independent
    of the OS, (except Vista Safari, e.g), don't. \r\n\r\nOn your site:\r\n\"So essentially
    you can think of an 800\xD7600 monitor resolution as 2400\xD7600.\"\r\nEssentially,
    however if you think this way, either you lose you color specification, e.g. black
    type is not, the user rotates the screen, or worse. You have 600 X 600 of 'a'
    color. You also have 600 X 600 for the location of the spacing units, unless you
    want the image of a glyph to vary from one location on the screen to another,
    ala Quartz. \r\n\r\n\"... an unprecedented innovation in font display technology
    that dramatically improves font display resolution and marks a genuine breakthrough
    in screen readability.\"\r\nWe all wish this had been true of ClearType, but as,
    and after, the uber-hype died out, we were more clearly informed that ClearType
    is just another way of making preview fonts for print, in consideration the low
    resolution range most users are afflicted with in their displays. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    if a browser will provide anti-aliasing on type on the web?\r\n\r\nA good article?
    \"Display Type & the Raster Wars\", e.g not... \r\n\r\nAll browsers, x-ept Safari
    on Vista, which brings it's own, use the native OS rendering which goes by two
    choices; the choice of the user on the Mac is of a size below which AA will not
    be used, or on windows whether to use standard or CT, or none for AA. In addition,
    each font can say at what size AA should start going up the resolution spectrum.
    I don't know what listens to the latter. \r\n\r\n\"Is it at the browser level
    or OS level?\r\nYes, and more as I said. \r\n\r\n\"as do latest versions of Microsoft\u2019s
    ClearType, starting with Vista I think.\"\r\n\r\nAs Miha points out, there could
    be privatized versions of CT from now on. As MS people explained to me, and I
    was gracious enough to suggest at a critical juncture in our standards discussions,
    that MS explain it to everyone present...Tom you was there:\r\n\r\nMS 'invented'
    an additional set of arguments for Instruction Control, a once obscure TT instruction,
    that's been brought to off-center stage by the resulting use. \r\n\r\nOnce any
    AA is in the OS it seems, y hints work about the same everywhere. X hints are
    treated with a variety of ignorance. \r\n\r\nOne option for CT's Instruction Control
    is 'compatible', which makes fonts rendered on integer metrics in the past, do
    so on the same (x) metrics when rendered in CT. Since the fonts previously rendered
    on whole pixels, this mode does too.  This is obviously important to protect the
    installed base of docs. I learned later that this mode reputedly sends the data
    to a PS rasterizer to get the integer metrics exactly right. The bodies and shapes
    are still rendered aliased, after some not particularly unintelligent... averaging
    (intelligent for imaging, but sadly not for type). The quality of results wholly
    depend on the user's resolution, and the (x) luck of the outline. This is an option
    of limited use to anyone other than MS.\r\n\r\nThe other option, called 'natural'
    forget about. MS wanted it part of the ISO standard as it is now, but they did
    not, and do not, want to document it. This option uses whatever image it gets,
    repeatedly, unlike Apple and Adobe AA. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClearTypePixels2_5143.jpg]\r\nThe
    image above, (now replaced on wikipedia by mea culpas to low resolution users
    from folks no longer employed by the companies they were representing when they
    were quoted), shows that repetition (top), as well as the saccadic pitfalls it
    introduces. \r\n\r\nAfter permission and size, I'll get back to this issue(s)
    :)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

    settings\r\n* The visitor's OS's rendering engine (and any related settings, if

    of \"interpretation\" of a typeface, should we add the following:\r\n\r\n* Hinting
    instructions provided by the suggested typeface?\r\n    - if so, at what level
    are these hinting instructions applied? OS? Browser?"

    the impression that the only browser with a font rendering engine of its own is
    Safari for Windows. If you're using Safari on Windows, I would expect the system

    for a browser to adjust anti-aliasing settings, most just inherit the system-level

  body: "I found this post when looking for a way to detect whether a browser is using
    antialiasing. And for that I found a really nice solution I thought I'd share.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a Javascript (see http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2009/11/29/how-to-detect-font-smoothing-using-javascript/)
    that does exactly that. It's really easy to use:\r\n\r\n1. Include the script.\r\n2.
    Call the TypeHelpers.hasSmoothing() function (preferably on page load).\r\n3.
    Add a class to the html or body element.\r\n\r\nUsing jQuery step 3 is easily
    done with:\r\n<code>\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!TypeHelpers.hasSmoothing())\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$('body').addClass('font-antialiasing-disabled');\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;else\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$('body').addClass('font-antialiasing-enabled');\r\n});\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nPages
    can then be styled with respect to this setting.\r\n\r\nFor example, on my site
    I use a custom font that is rather illegible without anti-aliasing, so in my CSS
    I have:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nbody.font-antialiasing-disabled {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family:
    Georgia, serif;\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nTo see it in action I use it live on my
    site <a href=\"http://lumens.se\" title=\"Lumens Br\xF6llopsfotografi - Br\xF6llopsfotograf
    i G\xF6teborg\">Lumens</a>.\r\nHope this is helpful for someone.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"
