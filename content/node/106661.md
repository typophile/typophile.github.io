  body: "I like the general idea. The colour looks a bit uneven, at least on my screen.
    Also, the upper serifs on /u look kind of out of place IMO.\r\n"

  body: altsan - thanks for the feedback. I'm going to come back to this one a bit
    later and upon reflection, I agree about the 'u'

  body: I find there is a problem with the lower case |u| because it's a reversed
    |n|. You have to adjust the width of the |u| It should be slightly narrower than
    the |n|. You will probably has to change the way that the serif is actually drew.
    Good start overall, but some round letters have a roundness problem, see the |S,
    s, o,| This problem is on all round letters. Keep going.
