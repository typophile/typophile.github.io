  is also used in the \"professional film & video\" tag next to their logo.\r\n\r\nIn
  particular, the Qs and Ss seem to be the most identifiable, but unfortunately I
  do not have the type in any larger size than this.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for
  the help."

    The superfamily is called Thesis, but the sub-families have been named TheSans,
    TheSerif and TheMix from the get-go. From [[Jan Middendorp]]'s book <em>Dutch
    Type</em>:\r\n\r\n<em>'Parenthesis' was the working name throughout the design
    process, but FontShop made it clear that, because of the lengthy suffixes, the
    font names would be too long. So it became Thesis. On the eve of the final presentation
    to FontShop, De Groot invented even shorter names for two of the sub-families:
    TheSans and TheSerif. He suggested that Thesis or TheSis should remain the name
    of the original half-serif, but this was seen to be puzzling. After a survey among
    colleagues, TheMix was chosen as font name for this hybrid version.</em>"
