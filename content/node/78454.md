    exhibition! The venue is neat too, the museum is located in the former mansion
    of a Japanese prince.  Nice garden for strolling around after the exhibit.\r\n\r\nThe
    Printing Museum near Iidabashi station is interesting and they offer printing
    workshops:\r\nhttp://www.printing-museum.org/en/index.html\r\n\r\nThe GGG gallery
    run by Dai-Nippon Printing in Ginza has good exhibits:\r\nhttp://www.dnp.co.jp/gallery/ggg_e/index.html\r\n\r\nYou
    can find lots of art listings here:\r\nhttp://www.tokyoartbeat.com/\r\n"

  body: If you want to make the "trek" down to Yokohama, the <a href="http://newspark.jp/newspark/english/index.html"
    title="Newsparl Museum">Newspark Museum</a> is there. It is dedicated to the growth
    of the Japanese newspaper industry from 1880 and probably has a great number of
    interesting artefacts. Haven't been there myself yet, but am planning to visit
    soon.

    safe.\r\n\r\nBTW, Zapf exhibition was postponed probably because of electricity
    shortage and in case of aftershocks. Besides train services have been in confusion
    due to planned outages."
