  body: I don't know what typeface they used, but it's a pity that they didn't use
    the [[http://www.johnlangdon.net/angelsanddemons.php|ambigram that was on the
    book]] (the top one).

    elements, and I don\u2019t know where they got the splayed M. I modified your
    image and broke it into 2; try using these in MyFont\u2019s identifont feature.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AngelsRespaced_4270.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Demons_Respaced_6097.png]"

  body: Sort of. I critique the way fonts are used <em>in</em> movies from time to
    time--mainly about whether the fonts are correct for the period depicted in a
    movie. However, Yves Peters has been regularly writing about the way fonts are
    used on movie posters and other publicity on FontShop's Unzipped blog ( http://www.fontshop.be/index.php?l=11
    ).
