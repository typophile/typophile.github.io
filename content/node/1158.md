body: Hmmm. Reading the Jakob Nielsen interview at pixelsurgeon.com. <BR> <BR>Have
  been learning Flash over the last couple months and we are using it for our site.
  <BR> <BR>Would like to be judicious with motion, but at the same time, want our
  site to be fun, not boring. We&#39;re not selling embalming fluid. We&#39;re not
  actuaries. <BR> <BR>Can anybody justify Nielsen&#39;s take, or debunk it? Do design/font
  sites get special exemption from the Nielsen Rules? <BR> <BR>Here are some links,
  including Porky&#39;s take.  <BR> <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.pixelsurgeon.com/pages/interview/design/jakobnielsen/index.html"

  body: ' It&#39;s interesting that when Nielsen talks about web usability he doesn&#39;t
    think about me. <BR> <BR>If I view his very own site, the text is next to unreadable
    because of the completely liquid layout. I don&#39;t like to read lines which
    contain over 200 characters. <BR> <BR>Besides that, the yellow colour on his page
    makes me nauscious. Usability doesn&#39;t have to equal ugliness.  <BR> <BR>He&#39;s
    right on the other hand when he says that 99% &#40;or whatever it is&#41; of flash
    pages don&#39;t really need flash. '

  body: Jack Schofield from The Guardian newspaper here in the UK spouted this regarding
    Mr Nielsen last year... <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0%2C4273%2C4211693%2C00.html"

    <BR> <BR>The Guardian were also decent enough to publish my rebuttal too, bless
    them, though I got a bit of a slating from the public the following week <IMG
    SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> Fancy suggesting
    that there might be an optimum number of words per line - I should be killed slowly...

  body: 'That book is 2 years old. Ancient in Web time  <BR>&#40;the industry has
    learned a lot since then&#41;. In  <BR>fact, my clients never quote Nielsen  <BR>anymore...
    thankfully. <BR> <BR>In the end, you&#39;ve gotta decide who your user  <BR>is
    and what will work best for them. &#40;For most  <BR>of Typophile, we&#39;ve gone
    with the belief that  <BR>Flash is the best way to deliver content that is  <BR>typographically
    true to the design. We also  <BR>know that most of our users have the plugin  <BR>already.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>You asked about Flash... A paste from  <BR>Nielsen&#39;s <A HREF="http://www.useit.com"
    TARGET="_blank"> www.useit.com</A> says it better than I could: <BR> <BR>&#62;The
    version of Flash introduced in 2002  <BR>&#62;&#40;Flash MX&#41; has solved many
    of the technical  <BR>&#62;usability problems in previous versions of  <BR>&#62;Flash.
    Among other things, Flash MX  <BR>&#62;supports accessibility and the &#34;Back&#34;
    button  <BR>&#62;in the browser. A very important usability  <BR>&#62;improvement
    is that Flash now ships with a  <BR>&#62;standard set of interaction controls:
    finally,  <BR>&#62;no more random scroll bars made up at the  <BR>&#62;whim of
    a Flash designer.} <BR> <BR>&#40;As an aside: Interesting how Nielsen&#39;s  <BR>changed
    his tune now that Macromedia is his  <BR>client... read the piece for yourself.
    In the end,  <BR>anything that helps this dogmatist think more  <BR>about context
    is a good thing.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;The lesson: Bash a company publicly long  <BR>enough
    and they&#39;ll hire you as an expert?&#41;'
