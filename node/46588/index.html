<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello all,
Being that I often search these forums for advice and it's always been helpful, I have decided to take the plunge and actually post a query for once, so here goes:
I am designing a cover for a book relating to the history of WWII, Germany in particular. I used Tannenberg Fett and DIN as my main typefaces, because I liked the modernity of hard edges and I thought the sharp edges seemed to work well to represent the time period and the aesthetic theme of the cover, in that the design slowly becomes more and more hard-edged and angular, as the book describes germany from before the war to during the war and I wanted to represent this shift visually...(sorry I can't show images at the moment, but I'll just try to describe what I was going for)
However, while the design was approved, and no one thinks that the design has Nazi overtones, the author has had reservations about the use of Tannenburg, so I have to change the typeface to something else. After research into the rise of the Schaftsteiffelgrotesk type of letterforms, I can see his point.
So: Does anyone have any suggestions about a German typeface, pre-WWII, that doesn't seem to convey "Nazi" all the while conveying both "German" and "hard-edged"? Is there a modern blackletter that would be suitable? Or, is there another, German, non-blackletter typeface that fits the bill?
I have found Potsdam, but I am concerned it is too similar to Tannenburg.
http://moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/htm/potsdam.htm
And I have found this logo, which I like the look of as well, but I am not too sure where I can find German typefaces like this, or if this is again too close to Tannenburg:

I don't want to glorify the Third Reich, obviously, but I want to find something that communicates the period and culture, yet has a minimal, geometric feel, and I am not sure where to go.
Thanks
Stef</div>

<div class=commentbody>Might be an odd choice but I would try H&FJ verlag</div>

What about something Bauhaus? Those are very German, pre-WWII, and without any Nazi undertones.
P22 has some nice ones:

<div class=commentbody>Kaas should be a political correct version (hehe) inspired by the geometric blackletters of the 1930s. Yeah, it's sharp and dark.

Or why not trying a black, condensed, pushing german Grotesk, like Futura bold Condensed or Erbar bold condensed – used big and set in uppercase?

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the quick response, I'm liking the suggestions, in particular Kaas and Fanfare, though I am liking Verlag and the idea of using Bauhaus/Futura/grotesk type fonts after all (I think I was being a little too rigid about what I needed, so it's nice to get some different opinions to help me see the light!)
As for Jessenschrift, I think it might not be hard-edged enough for the design, but I am remembering it for the future, as where I work I do alot of WWII history books so I need a good list of typefaces from the period to use...
Thanks!
