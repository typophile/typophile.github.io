  is a technical letter that goes from friendly to high-tech to cheeky with ease.\r\n\r\nOur
  Gotham typeface, inspired by signs on buildings, celebrates the workmanlike \u201Cdraftsman\u2019s
  alphabet\u201D at a monumental scale. Similarly unadorned, but at a more intimate
  size, is the lettering of engineering: the marks on precision instruments, blueprints,
  stencils and templates. Drawn, stamped, engraved and routed, these forms are sensitively
  captured by our new Gotham Rounded family, available in eight styles including italics.\r\n"
