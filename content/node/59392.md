body: "Have .notdef boxes gone out of style? I used to leave them blank because I
  didn't realize how critical they were for typographers in preventing expensive disasters.
  For example: going to press without spotting missing glyphs. Recently MyFonts (the
  <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/whatsnew/\">new site</a>) added a choice of multilingual
  pangrams. So give it a try. Switch your sample text to Japanese and browse. If my
  .notdefs are missing it's because I forgot to add them. But some font designers
  seem to always leave them out and most do it about half the time.\r\n\r\nMy point:
  does anyone deliberately leave .notdefs blank? If so, why?"

  body: "Nick, it's not a good idea to leave the .notdef glyph blank. The point of
    the glyph is to signal the presence of characters not supported by the font, and
    that includes characters beyond the codepages that the font aims to support. If
    your .notdef glyph is blank or, worse, blank and zero-width, those characters
    will simply disappear from the text in many applications. Consider what happens
    if someone is using one of your fine fonts, but is sent a text for typesetting
    that includes e.g. one Chinese character. There should be some visible indication
    that this character is present and that it requires a different font to be selected.\r\n\r\nMy
    preferred .notdef design is a box with a question mark in it. Recently, seeking
    to give this maximum visual impact on the page, I've taken to reversing the question
    mark out of a black box. I usually align the height of the box to the cap-height,
    because this producing a proportion that doesn't have an atypical impact on the
    line-layout, i.e. its width is representative of a typical missing character."

    using a random Arial codepoint that resulted in a missing glyph. He used it as
    a check-box on all his forms. When we updated the font his check boxes were all

  body: "Nick, the .notdef glyph dates back to Apple's original TT spec: it is to
    be the first glyph in a font, it is to be named .notdef, and it is to be unencoded.
    It provides the ultimate fallback -- after font switching or other mechanisms
    that an application may choose to employ -- to display <em>something</em> when
    text includes a character that is not supported in the font. The .notdef glyph
    is not a Unicode characters because it may represent <em>any</em> Unicode character
    that is not mapped in the font cmap table.\r\n\r\nSi wrote: <em>I\u2019m surprised
    we don\u2019t see more creative shapes \u2013 logos, alien heads etc.</em>\r\n\r\nI'm
    glad we don't. I recall some users being confused by the spiral in the Palatino
    Linotype fonts. It is better that this glyph approximate the evolved conventions:
    an empty rectangle, a rectangle with diagonal lines corner-to-corner (the form
    Adobe uses), a rectangle with a question mark in it, a reversed rectangle with
    a question mark in it.\r\n\r\nIn traditional Japanese typography, a placeholder
    sort was used for a similar purpose: to mark a place in the text that would require
    a character from a different font. This enabled the typesetter to keep working
    and to leave a visible marker in the text to indicate the place where the other-font
    character should be inserted. If I recall correctly, the sort had a horizontal
    rectangle in the upper half, so would print as a black rectangle above a white
    rectangular space. This form might be appropriate for the .notdef glyph in an
    East Asian font, although Ken Lunde should comment on this and correct me if I
    am wrong. It led me to experiment with this form:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ndj_5358.gif]"

    say a piece of text includes a character not supported by the current font cmap
    table. An application (or system/library/engine) may automatically use the .notdef
    glyph, or it may go through a series of degrading fallbacks. It may try to find
    a default font on the system for displaying the character; if it can't find such
    a font, it may try to find a default fallback font such as Apple use in order
    to at least identify the Unicode range and script to which the missing character
    belongs; if the system does not have such a font, the ultimate fallback should
