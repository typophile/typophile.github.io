  Started</strong>\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the [[TypoWiki]] is an encyclopedia of typography
  for the [[Typophile]] community. Since it is a community-driven tool that can take
  shape in virtually infinite ways, it\u2019s a natural evolution of the forum in
  that we can now separate factual information from opinion and discourse.\r\n\r\nBest
  of all, the forums and wiki are fully integrated, so now we can all refer to wiki
  topics by simply wrapping the term in question in double brackets [ [ like this
  ] ]. Typophile will color the link green and follow the term with a small superscript
  \u201CW.\u201D\r\n\r\nAn entry does not have to exist to reference the Wiki. If
  you want to create a reference to a topic that could one day become an entry, simply
  wrap it in double brackets.. These \"entries-in-waiting\" are typically referred
  to as \u201Cstubs,\u201D and graduate to standard entries once someone has added
  content. Stubs are distinguished from standard entries by a red \"W\".\r\n\r\nTypophile
  co-creator, [[Jared Benson]], says, \"Personally I\u2019m hoping that the wiki can
  become the go-to place for frequently asked questions that normally end up in the
  forums. Is there any reason why the wiki couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t resolve
  questions like:\r\n1. Does anyone know any fonts that look like font x?\r\n2. What
  fonts go well with font x?\r\n3. Can you guys recommend any good quirky rodeo fonts?\"\r\n\r\nInformation

  Etiquette</strong>\r\n\r\nThe rules of conduct for the Typowiki are different than
  those you may be used to for the Typophile forums. When authoring an article, you
  should be \"concise, complete, and unafraid to pass judgement.\" However, wiki articles
  should not become biased. That is not to say that there is no room for opinion in
  Typowiki articles. In fact, articles on controversial topics that present multiple
  perspectives are more thought-provoking and more interesting for the reader. Linking
  to relevant discussion threads on Typophile is an excellent way to showcase differences
  of opinion and to direct interested readers to additional information on these types
  of topics. For an example of a well-written Typowiki article that presents differences
  of opinion in a fair and balanced manner, see the entry for [[Mrs_Eaves|Mrs Eaves]].\r\n\r\nIn
  Review:<ul><li>Base articles mainly on factual information</li>\r\n<li>Be clear
  about what information is opinion</li>\r\n<li>If you disagree with an opinion presented
  in an article, add another point of view</li>\r\n<li>Leave arguments in the forum
  area</li>\r\n<li>Respect both minority and majority opinions</li></ul>\r\n\r\nIf
  you would like to participate in a discussion on Typowiki etiquette, you may do
  so at: http://typophile.com/node/12424#comment-72477\r\n\r\n<a name=\"dialog\"></a>\r\n<strong>A
  Brief FAQ-style Dialog</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>What if I have very strong opinions about
  a typeface, designer, or foundry?</em>\r\n\r\nThat's nice, Sparky. You must be a
  very perceptive and discerning typographer, to have such strong opinions.\r\n\r\nOf
  course you have strong opinions! Anyone who cares about fonts and type enough to
  participate in building the Typowiki must have a passion for them. But you're writing
  for a community resource, and when you write for Typowiki, you should be trying
  to write from the community's perspective. That's not to say that you have to squelch
  your opinion, or that every opinion has to be precisely balanced -- or even fair
  -- but it does mean you need to acknowledge your opinion isn't the only one out
  there. Also, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between colorfully expressing
  your opinion and libel, but you should know when you're being a jerk. Refrain.\r\n\r\n<em>But
  I really hate Helvetica a lot. I mean, come on. It's characterless and it's hard
  to read text set in it and it sucks.</em>\r\n\r\nI'm sure [[Max Miedinger]] and
  [[Eduard Hoffmann]], were they still alive, would be suitably chastened by all of
  the withering critiques directed towards their most famous achievement. There's
  no case left to be made for [[Helvetica]], except for the fact that it was one the
  key type families used by one of the 20th century's most influential design movements,
  it's built into most laser printers, it's gotten used for who knows how many thousand
  corporate communication designs, and it's one of a vanishingly small number of typefaces
  to have an entire art book aimed at the general public dedicated to it. You don't
  like it. Terrific. The most noble thing you as a typographer can do to express your
  dislike for it is not to use it. But just because you don't like it doesn't give
  you the right to edit history, so even if you decide to rant and rave about its
  bland, beige horribleness on Typowiki, please do acknowledge its very important
  history and still-current popularity. Also, remember that Typophile has some very
  nice <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forums/\">forums</a>. As already mentioned,
  they're far more appropriate for getting your opinions off your chest.\r\n\r\n<em>What
  about Comic Sans? Can't we all agree it's terrible?</em>\r\n\r\nWhile it's true
  that even [[Vincent Connare]], the designer of [[Comic Sans]], is somewhat bemused
  by its ongoing popularity, and there is a <a href=\"http://www.bancomicsans.com/\">rough
  consensus</a> within the design world that it's a terrible font, it's also very
  popular with the general public. To dismiss that popularity instead of engaging
  with it would only alienate readers coming to Typowiki for information and advice.
  Also, Mr. Connare is a skilled type designer, and he really doesn't deserve the
  level of vitriol he's had leveled at him over the years.\r\n\r\nAll of the typefaces
  we love and hate so much were designed by other people, many of whom are still alive.
  Unless you want Typophile to be perceived as an insular community of iconoclasts
  (or, to put it more bluntly, a bunch of elitist snobs), it would be a good idea
  to temper your writing with the kind of common courtesy you'd extend to your peers
  if you were discussing their work -- or them -- with them in person. Even if you
  don't care how the rest of the world perceives Typophile or the online typographic
  community, some of us do, and you should keep in mind that intemperate outbursts
  in the wiki are likely to be modified by other Typowiki users, and the more irate
  or sardonic your spleen-venting, the more drastic will be the resulting revisions.
  If you think something is likely to be controversial, bring it up in the forums
  first. Then you can rant as much as you want in the discussion thread and link to
  that from the Typowiki entry.\r\n\r\nAlso, a brief note: the tendency in writing
  for a general audience is towards accolades rather than harsh criticism. However,
  hyperbole in either direction is not particularly useful. Keep in mind that many
  of the people coming to Typowiki will be new students or relatively inexperienced
  enthusiasts, and when you're learning something, it's easy to take enthusiastic
  endorsements as prescriptions. Just because you think loosely-tracked, all-lowercase
  headlines are the ultimate way to set sans serif type doesn't mean you get to tell
  everyone else they're the only available option. Unless you're [[Jan Tschichold]]
  or [[Robert Bringhurst]], in which case you can do whatever you want."
