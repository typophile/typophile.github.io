  body: Flash has always supported anti aliased fonts &#40;I&#39;m hoping you wheren&#39;t
    just trying to be ironic here!&#41; as flash is a vector based package. Pixel
    fonts are a bit of a fad, which &#40;hopefully&#41;  will pass. It&#39;s an escape
    route for &#39;web designers&#39; who are scared of typography, choosing to make
    it small is the safe option. I suppose I&#39;m being very generalistic here and
    that their are those who deliberately went out to use pixel fonts to tie in with
    a theme/style &#40;the retro computer game look!&#41;. So why use pixel fonts?
    Well one of the problems with displaying type on screen at anything smaller than
    8pt &#40;some would argue 10pt&#41;, causes the type deteriorate in visual quality,
    where as pixel fonts are exactly that based on the pixels of your monitor. <BR>
    <BR>As for buying a piece of software to build these fonts?... I wouldn&#39;t.

  body: Flash used to not support bitmap fonts. Preferring clear rendering &#40;as
    opposed to blurry detritus&#41; is not a fad, it&#39;s functional. The new Flash
    however does support bitmap fonts, although still not grayscale bitmaps. The good
    news is that Truth in Design has developed &#34;Superpixel fonts&#34; that fake
    gray dots via outlines. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
