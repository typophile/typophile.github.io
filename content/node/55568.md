body: "Is it possible to specify in OpenType features a change in line height for
  specific languages? \r\n\r\nThis is especially useful for languages that have stacked
  diacritics like Vietnamese where those accents might frequently interfere with the
  line above, but might also help optically with languages that use frequent capitals
  like German, or that are entirely of majiscule form, like Cherokee. \r\n\r\nI've
  finally learned how to change the default line height so my font won't show up as
  if it's always set for Vietnamese, but should I rely on the end user to adjust the
  leading themselves or would it be prudent to provide it as a feature in the font?"

  body: "I don't think so ... also what effect would that have on a line that has
    multiple languages?\r\n\r\nI guess it could just go with the max line height,
    but I that might be pretty visually jarring if it's just for one or two words.
    \ I'd set the default for single-accented text, and at most suggest to the user
    a preferred line height for different languages. \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es

    table to be added to the OT spec. \r\nIt is a critical addition that we would
    all like to see implemented. Vote here. :)\r\n\r\nCheers!"
