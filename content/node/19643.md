  on web typography. If anyone has any recommendations of resources to check out,
  they are very welcome and appreciated. I'll be documenting most of what I'm reading
  on my site (it's in my profile if anyone wants to look... I didn't add the link
  here to avoid spamming).\r\nThanks for any advice you're willing to share.\r\n-Casey"
