  this beautiful resource. Large scans, page by page of this illustrated and hand-scribed
  book.\r\n\r\n[[http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0003/bsb00034024/images/index.html?id=00034024&fip=196.210.192.101&no=48&seite=1]]\r\n\r\nIt
  seems to be the full book, I haven't gone through all the pages yet though. And
  there's a mention of a PDF download - but it's all German to me. :)\r\n\r\nRead
  more about the book here:\r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Chronicles]]\r\n\r\n-Rudolf"
