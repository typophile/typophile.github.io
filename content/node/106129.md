  political/social commentary comic strip and I'm looking for suggestions for the
  dialog typeface for the two main characters.\r\nAnyone care to share their personal
  favorites or make a suggestion as to where to look ?\r\nI'm thinking about starting
  out on utube and using the response to the strip to decide whether or not to print
  a collection in letter press, hardcover bound, limited run, real books.\r\nNot looking
  to make money on this. Just doing the print run for fun.\r\nRight now I'm lettering
  the dialog by hand but, aside from being nearly illegible, my handwriting is not
  distinctive enough to create two different typeface styles to clearly indicate the
  two different characters.\r\nI plan to use different fonts to emphasize certain
  emotions and so forth but, like I say the basic dialog is going to be the long hard
  road for me.\r\nAny help would be great !\r\nMerl"

    back in my personal archives and see what the old Doonesbury cartoons are done
    up with but, I don't want to just reuse the font from someone elses work."

    apparently by Trudeau's assistant. Presumably the older strips feature his own
    lettering."

  body: "HA, good old Pogo !\r\nIt seems that this will be as challenging as I thought.\r\nI
    was hoping to avoid having to hand letter but, the more fonts I try I feel like
    I'm pushing myself to do just that.\r\nI create the line drawings of the two characters
    with an old CAD program but, so far any text I place, just seems out of place.\r\nI
    am able to make free hand sketches with the CAD program but, I don't have the
    correct mouse to make the lines and hand written text as if I was using a pen.
    (do they make such a thing?)\r\nI am going to look at some of these digital sketch
    pads but, I'm just not sure they will give me what I'm looking for without going
    to a really high end device, and I'm not ready to lay out that kind of scratch
    just yet.\r\nThanks again for all the help ! "
