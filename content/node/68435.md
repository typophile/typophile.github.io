  be working on the invites. The save the date card uses all Phaeton as it's fairly
  simple with larger text. The invites, however, will have much more information and
  I'm thinking Phaeton won't be the most readable text font. As such, I was thinking
  of using it for the main titles and larger text and trying to find a suitable text
  font for the smaller stuff. \r\n\r\nThe feel of the wedding as best I can describe
  it will be organic, southern (American), elegant, old fashioned, yet modern. \r\n\r\nHere
  is the link to Phaeton: http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000447
  \r\n\r\nThe save the date is actually similar in feel to the specimen there.\r\n\r\nAny
  and all suggestions are welcome. Thanks\r\n\r\n-\r\n<em>penn</em>"

  body: "Hi Penn,\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks for licensing Phaeton. I'd love to see the
    invites when they're done.\r\n\r\nAs for pairing suggestions:\r\nIf you are printing
    letterpress, then I think you have more options. If not, consider using a subtly
    distressed font to match. Check out <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000054\">Olduvai</a>
    which has a similar finish and works well for text. Also, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/download/pdf/phaeton_guide.pdf\">the
    users guide for Phaeton</a> and contact me through typophile if that text companion
    would suit your needs (it has bold, italic and bold italic also). \r\n\r\nThese
    quality options might work well:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/metallophilesp8.html\">Metallophile
    (a rough futura) would be great I think</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://iginomarini.com/fell/the-revival-fonts/\">The
    (free) Fell types from Igino Marini</a> would also compliment well I think.\r\n\r\nThese
    grouping at FontShop may also get your brain going:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/distressed_text_serif/\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/distressed_sans_serif/\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRandy\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the help! (My brain was stuck and I just needed a bit of help
    to dislodge it)\r\n\r\nRandy \u2014 Great suggestions! (Of course, what else could
    I expect from the font's co-creator?) I love all these options; now I have lots
    of leads to follow. Once I get closer to designing the invitation I'll know more
    about what I want from the font and I'll be able to make a better decision then.\r\n\r\nI
    will be letterpressing these myself at a local studio where I can rent press time.
    Were there options you think I could explore, since I'm letterpressing them, that
    you didn't mention above?\r\n\r\nI'll attach the save the date as a pdf above
    as well, so you can see how I've used (and possibly abused) Phaeton.* It's not
    finalized \u2014 I'm still monkeying around with the top bit \u2014 so suggestions
    on that are welcome as well.\r\n\r\n-\r\n<em>penn</em>\r\n\r\n*Sidenote: incidentally,
    while scanning the new releases at borders the other day, I saw a rather hideous
    usage of it. It was stretched and curved so that I could hardly recognize it,
    but I'm certain it was Phaeton. If I can remember what book it was I'll be sure
    to send it along."

    Harley Earl would have named a Cadillac in 1931.\r\nIf one pronounces it \"Fee-ton\",
    may it be spelled with a diphthong?"

  body: "This looks like it's going to be a fun wedding!\r\n\r\nRe: letterpress --
    I just was thinking that whats en vogue for wedding letterpress is a very deep
    impression for the \"tactile\" feel. If that is the case, i'd expect non-distressed
    fonts will be fine with phaeton since the overall feeling will be crafty anyways.\r\n\r\nRe:
    hideousness -- well, quality paints do not a painter make. I would be curious
    if you do remember the title.\r\n\r\nNick, yes on the buggy. But they stole the
    name from the greek pantheon. Phaeton was the son of Helios. When he borrowed
    the keys to dads chariot he burned rubber a little too close to earth and Zeus
    smoked him with a thunderbolt. I've seen Phaeton, Pha\xEBton and Pha\xEBthon and
    indeed: Ph\xE6ton -- but i can't speak to the correctness."

    second look I may have been a tad hyperbolic about its hideousness, but clearly
    some bad choices made with such a gorgeous font. \r\n\r\nGetting closer to the
    invites, so I'll let you know what we decide for the text font. Thanks again for
    your help."

    What, according to you would be a serif and a sans-serif companions for a website?
    I am using Phaeton as main branding fonts and want to use a serif and a sans-serif
    font for body text/heading and meta items text respectively. \r\n\r\nThanks in
    advance!"
