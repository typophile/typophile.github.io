<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Here's my first attempt at a complete font in a long time. It's a modern-looking slightly condensed slab serif. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind taking a look and suggesting areas for improvement. I know the uppercase S needs work, and there are a few other things that seem like they might be odd, but I've looked at it so much that I need some outside input.
(It's not going to be called Slabbo, thankfully -- that's all I could come up with for now)
thanks!

<div class=commentbody>I really like tis design. Two suggestions-if it was me I'd angle the crossbar of the e to follow the slope that runs through other things-like the bottom of the loops on p and q for instance. I'd also lenthen the downsloping diagonal in the ampersand to reach the baseline.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I guess, Paul get that bounty.
Hm, when I originally looked at it, only the "&" stroke my eye, here I have to second him. Now, however, having read his post, I have to agree on the "e". try to parallel the design element of slope of the "a", "p", "g", etc.
What about some tweak to the descender or "g" into the same direction as well?

Generally:
The first thing I would say is: Think about the white spaces just as much as the black. This means in common combinations in between the letters and in terms of the white spaces made by the insides of the b vs d vs h vs s and so on. to my eye they are not harmonized. This will take time to be able to see and think about. But it's good to start early.
This font is very "constructed", meaning it appears to be made of common parts. There is nothing wrong with this per se but it can lead you to simply put the font together with the parts you have rather than inventing new ones when you need them. Also superficially similar parts often need to be tweaked to work well and so are not really the same.
Specifically:
Your a looks too much likean o - it won't identify as a quickly enough. The inside bowl of your b is too small. It doesn't fit with the other letters. The p,g & q are awkward in their joins. Look at your u. It is working better. Your arm of your r is too tentative. Maybe extend the serif of the botto right of the r a bit. The t is weak - let it expand.The top of your o needs to overshoot further. The crossbar on the f is too small so the f doesn't reaf as an f quickly enough. The x and w are too heavy. Lighten those strokes so they fit with the other letters. The descenders on the p & q are not the same. Why? The design of the s isn't working with the feeling of the rest of the design. Cutting the ends of some letters of at an abngle doesn't seem to fit either. Maybe go flat or pick a different angle.
Keep in mind that each letter needs to be a memeber of the family and not stand out too much.
This is a lot I know. This fellow may be able to help:

Good luck with this, and keep going!

<div class=commentbody>Thanks so much for all the help! This is exactly what I needed.
Eben, you're right -- it does look like it's constructed of common parts. I suppose that's because it is. That's definitely an area I need to work on, and will hopefully get better with practice.
I'll work on a revision and then post my progress.
Paul, where would you like me to send that shiny quarter?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Jonathan
This face has got some very nice modern forms the Lowercase d and p in particular. I would reign in the both of the Ss, they have two much character. The f would benefit from a higher wider crossbar and the t's crossbar should also be wider. I also agree with whoever said that the r is timid looking.
Have a look at a face called Flama its a nicely drawn sans but with a hint of DIN in the square shapes.
And bear in mind that this is all coming from a someone who's been designing type for at least 20 years but has yet to finish one. I therefore have a lot of respect for the people – including yourself – who post their designs here.
