  body: I hope this is a custom lettering or at least a very expensive commercial
    typeface (but not a French one ;) but as I can't spot a perfect match my eyes
    say you could fairly approximate it starting with [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/corporate+a|Corporate
    A]] (mainly flattening /I top and slightly reducing /E centre crossbar to make
    room for /I).

  body: "Reminds me of a font with this distinctive leg on the _R_ by the quintessential
    British font designer Eric Gill released as Perpetua in the early 1930s and which
    would have been very familiar to a British monogram maker in the Coronation year
    of 1953  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PerpetuaAsER_5212.gif] \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/perpetua/\r\nAssuming
    that the monogram has not been redone since then.\r\n\r\nDon"
