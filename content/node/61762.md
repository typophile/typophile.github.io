  post]] about some of my concerns about the upcoming widespread use of @font-face.
  I'm really excited about the design possibilities but am also worried about bad
  typography uglying up the internet...\r\n\r\n<strong>Please view the post here:\r\n[[http://blog.twg.ca/2009/09/4-fears-of-font-face/]]</strong>\r\n\r\nI
  would definitely love comments and to hear additional fears from typophiles! \r\n\r\n<cite>\"Hopefully
  @font-face will make the internet a more beautiful place, and not like a bunch of
  designers got drunk on the punch and barfed fonts everywhere.\"</cite>"

    copyright and browser compatibility issues are resolved?
