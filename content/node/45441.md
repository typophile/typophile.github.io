  for the life of me figure out what the swirly script font is. I've gone through
  the Bowfin Printworks list and can't find it, so I'm turning to the experts!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/script

  body: "The 'I'looks a lot like the swash J from [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0005366#characters|Bickham
    Script]]. The rest of the word Invited looks like [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=TTT0000051#flont|Ventura]],
    with an alternate connecting 'v' that shows up in the character map.\r\n\r\nI
    can't see the rest of the script very well. Maybe a better view would help.\r\n\r\n-

    font ID 2_6157.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe caps really make me think of super swashy Bickham,
    but the lowercase letters don't look Bickham-y at all. Maybe it is two fonts,
    I hadn't considered that possibility.\r\n\r\nPS, Mr Yanega, I just wanted to say
    that I'm a total fangirl of your script font list. Thank you for compiling it!"

    it's Copper Alt Caps Expert.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for the suggestions!"

  body: "The [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/classic/copper/|Copper]] font says it's
    based on copperplate script designs. Champion Script is based on the same script
    that Francoise Boltana used for his font of the same name. I have to say that
    this \"Copper\" family really does look to me like a hybrid of styles, rather
    than a unified script style.\r\n\r\nTrish, thanks for your comment, and for showing
    me a new Script font for the Guide. If you have this font, and would be willing
    to make samples for the Guide, I would be very grateful.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
