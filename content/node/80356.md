body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI recently bought Letterror's [[Superpolator]]. I've seen all
  the [[http://letterror.blip.tv/file/1909019/|video's about it]] from the Robothon
  2009 event, but still the program stays a bit of a mystery to me. Since there is
  no (known) manual for Superpolator, other than the Robothon 2009 video's, I hope
  there are some people out there willing to share tips and tricks. Perhaps we could
  even build a wiki page for it.\r\n\r\nThese are the issues I'd like to be enlightened
  on:\r\n\r\n<strong>1) Importing/updating individual [[UFO]] glyphs</strong>\r\nIf
  you edit your masters in Fontlab and and want to update them in Superpolator, do
  you replace the existing master or can you update just the glyphs you editted in
  [[Fontlab]]?\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Automatic update master in Superpolator</strong>\r\nIs
  the master automatically updated when you export the UFO file again from [[Fontlab]]?
  Since the files should be in the same folder with the .spe file, does Superpolator
  check them and automatically update the master?\r\n\r\nFeel free to dump your Q&A
  here. \r\n\r\nThnx,\r\nRene"

    has a help file that covers everything you need to know. Load masters, assign
    an axis, create instances, done!\r\n\r\nAs for automatic updates, yes, Superpolator
    tracks changes to an open UFO file and automatically updates. I find the best
    tool for managing this is Tal Leming\u2019s UFOCentral script.\r\n\r\nAs for where
    to put the UFO/SPE files, it doesn't really matter. But to keep myself from getting
    confused I usually just stick the SPE file in the parent folder for the family
    and leave the UFO files in child directories created for each master font."

  body: "You're right! I've found the manual. \r\nSuperpolator stays buggy on my iMac.
    I keeps crashing when I want to delete a master or change the font size. The macro's
    don't all work and it gives me an error DialogKit is not installed. I installed
    it 5 times but still no luck.\r\nI'm a bit frustrated now... I'll try it again
    tomorrow. This makes no sence now.\r\n\r\nThnx anyway  :D"
