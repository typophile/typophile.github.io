  [[http://typekit.com/fonts/nimbus-sans|Nimbus Sans]]. This font is similar, but
  not identical. The \"R\" of Nimbus Sans [[http://i.imgur.com/eVUjugc.png|curves]],
  while the font above is straight.\r\n- [[http://typekit.com/fonts/museo-sans|Museo
  Sans]]. Again, similar, but not identical. The \"1\" of Museo Sans has a [[http://i.imgur.com/tY6jojT.png|bottom
  line]], while the font above does not.\r\n\r\nWhat in the world font is this?"

    visual database searches with any degree of accuracy (letters need to be at least
    100 px tall and at a decent resolution). \r\n\r\nAre there more images from the
    design? Your only hope of finding a match is if you can obtain a larger sample.
    There just isn't enough reliable detail in what you posted...."
