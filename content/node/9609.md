  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to find a font that would work well in support of Eclat.
  If a logo was in Eclat, what would be a good face for the strapline? I was thinking
  maybe a rounded serif? a rounded sans the right tone of voice but has been used
  to death recently. Ive been playing with Clarendon Bold Condensed but it&#39;s not
  right. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>cheers
