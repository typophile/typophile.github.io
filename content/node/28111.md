body: "Another acquaintance has asked me to ID this specimen. It would seem to be
  Futura, but he swears there are subtle differences (perfect uniformity of stroke
  width, equal size of arms/crossbars of the F and E, perfect symmetry of the S and
  the angle at which the stroke terminates, etc.). He also seems convinced that this
  specimen does not correspond to any currently available weight of Futura. It is
  a vintage US Army specimen from the 1950s or thereabouts. Did the Army have its
  own version of Futura that differs from commercial versions, or are these differences
  the result of rough printing with old metal type?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GI-Futura_6643.jpg]"

  body: There are always going to be differences in appearance between metal type,
    lino, and digital. This is certainly Futura, the closest I can find is Futura
    Heavy.

  body: "I think a close one is Futura No. 7 Medium T (URW). I am not convinced, however.
    If it was done by Photolettering, who knows, because they had so many fonts and
    a lot of Futuraesque (I liked Madison) in the library.\r\n\r\nThe Truth shall
    set you free\r\n"
