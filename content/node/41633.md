    want. You can also make some components that are triangles of the desired degrees
    and mirror and rotate them as needed. You can copy and paste the parts from glyph
    to glyph.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Font, and Lettering Bible</em> to complement <em>Learn Fontlab Fast</em>. It\u2019s
    full of useful construction techniques like the one Chris mentioned, fully illustrated
    and dripping with humor. That book is so good I had a very hard time not giving
    Leslie a big hug when I met him last summer.\r\n"
