  body: '&#34;BRAND&#34; is Helvetica. Other than that, I believe the whole thing
    was hand-lettered.  <BR> <BR>FYI, this is an old design and such things were routinely
    done by hand because of the limitations of metal type. You may find some fonts
    similar to the letterforms on this label, but it&#39;s unlikely you will find
    any exact matches &#40;unless a Jack Daniel&#39;s fan has created fonts based
    on the label lettering&#41;.'

  body: That was discussed at this Board in 2003 &#40;<a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8442.html?1049994456"
    target="_blank">see thread here</a>&#41; with no solution, and Google found several
    other failed attempts at getting an ID for this. I think this is either an antique
    typeface or custom work &#40;or both&#41;, and your best chance would be to approximate
    it or draw it yourself, because even if a typeface was used for the original,
    it has not apparently been digitized.

  body: Eduardo, that&#39;s a good call. Looks like the alternate face provides the
    &#39;s&#39;, but the &#39;T&#39; doesn&#39;t seem to match in the Swash face.

  body: Korinna&#39;s serifs are more slabbish -- not rounded like the example. Korinna&#39;s
    W is missing the serifs on the baseline and the S is quite different. <BR>This
    is a hard one. My first thought was Goudy, but that&#39;s also way off.. &#60;sigh&#62;
