body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI noticed a lot of posters to do with typography, or made by typographic
  folks, are 'silkscreens'. The silkscreens seem rather expensive to me, which I assume
  is due to the printing process. So, are they really more expensive, and if so, are
  they really worth it? What makes a silkscreen better than an offset print or a high-quality
  laserprint?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper "

  body: Didn't the silkscreen is cheaper than of offset and laser printing when it
    comes to materials? and it only matters the printing procedure because in laser
    and offset printing, just simply set your setting, and have it print automatically
    the way you want, unlike in silkscreen there are much ways of doing manual procedures
    than of its digital maneuver. You may <a href=http://www.digiteksf.com/offset-printing-2/

    than of silkscreen.

  body: "They aren't necessarily better, but the ink deposit is thicker & colours
    can be more intense. A screen print can be a tactile experience as well as a visual
    one. \r\n\r\nThe cost is in part, related to the size of the run, like any other
    print job. But screen printing is not a high volume, high speed media. When I
    was a screen printer a run of a few thousand was a lot for the company I worked
    for. \r\n\r\n like letterpress printing,  many of the screen printers still in
    business are in it for the love of it (aside from those cheapo T-shirt printers)
    and the quality of the print is down to the skill of the printer. You also pay
    for that.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yea, pretty much what Russell said. It's like asking which is better: Woodblock
    printing or Intaglio? It's really just two different ways to make an art print.
    \r\n\r\nThere's probably still a bit of an assumption that screenprinting, being
    at least partially hand-created has a bit more of a cache when it comes to 'art'
    but these days digital/ink-jet (or 'giclee' if you prefer the marketing term)
    printing is of such a quality that one can certainly find respected (and expensive)
    prints in that medium. \r\n\r\n"

    durability. Conventional printing can be more fragile and will fade faster when
    exposed to bright light / sunlight. \r\n\r\n> or a high-quality laserprint\r\n\r\nA
    laser print is fine for a business report or a poster that'll hang on the bulletin
    board a few weeks, but not for something more permanent."

  body: "Some 45 years ago, a college freshman who knew nothing about printing got
    talked into helping silkscreen some posters for a play that was being presented
    on campus. The inks and solvents he inhaled so corroded his brain as to leave
    him unfit for proper employment, and he was left to support himself (and later
    his family) by designing textbooks.\r\n\r\nBut enough about me. Silkscreen printing
    is the medium of choice when you want densely opaque, flat, solid colors--something
    that offset lithography just can't do. It's also ideal when you're printing on
    something that has an irregular shape or texture, so you can't run it through
    an offset press--a coffee mug, a T-shirt, the front of a vending machine.\r\n\r\nSilkscreen
    printing doesn't print halftones with the high resolution you get from offset.
    It's a better choice for bold, hard-edged, high-contrast shapes, which can include
    letterforms. \r\n\r\nThere are companies that do silkscreen printing on a massive,
    industrial scale (all those \"Life Is Good\" T-shirts and \"Keep Calm and Carry
    On\" coffee mugs didn't come from some hippie in his garage). But unlike offset
    lithography, silkscreen printing doesn't require costly, industrial-size presses.
    It can be done as a craft, by someone with talent, effort, imagination, and a
    few hundred dollars' worth of gear. And of course, hand craft work will always
    cost more than manufactured goods that reflect the economies of scale."

  body: "PublishingMojo, I was just checking into doing a very small run (under 12)
    of t-shirts. The set-up cost plus the cost for minimum run plus the cost for a
    few tees is hard to justify my eventual price per tee. So, I've been looking around
    for online tutorials to do the shirts myself. The design is nothing intricate,
    just simple heavy text. \r\n\r\nIs it all that hard to create the screens? Do
    you have some pointers ...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    documentary a few days ago.</a>\r\n\r\nIt's had me thinking, maybe I'll make a
    frame or two, buy some hinges  and squeegees, some cuttable emulsion and pull
    a few prints.\r\n\r\n... But not with the highly toxic solvent, laquer, vinyl
    and polyester based inks mentioned earlier. I once worked on a job printing 2000
    18\" x 36\" window decals - four colours on double sided on clear vinyl which
    meant that with both sides, a white background layer and an opaque block-out layer
    each piece went through the press 11 times, leaving 9000 square feet of wet vinyl
    ink gassing off into the shop for two hours beween colours. "
