    target="_blank"> Zebrawood Fill</a>. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s funny how the &#34;fill&#34;
    variants of those layered  <BR>Tuscans and other wood types are so wildly popular  <BR>without
    the actual &#34;framework&#34; designs. I&#39;ve rarely  <BR>seen <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/ROSQ/F_ROSQ-10005000.jhtml"

    Rosewood Fill</a> just keeps popping up everywhere  <BR>from CD covers and posters
    to websites.

    could&#39;ve had your ID <i>wayyy</i> sooner. <BR> <BR>P.S. I quite like the opening
    page to <a href="http://pw1.netcom.com/~phillip.cavette/" target="_blank"> your
    site</a>. Reminds me of the  <BR><a href="http://quimby.gnus.org/warehouse/anl2/anl2.html"
