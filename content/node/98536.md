body: "Hey all!\r\n\r\nI'm creating a logotype for a band and in the stage of looking
  for type references. The band is a sort of sexy, female fronted, classic rock with
  an edge sort of sound and look. Equal parts Pat Benatar, Metallica, and early The
  Who.\r\n\r\nSo I've found this typeface over at My Fonts and I feel like this is
  a good starting place for something that could be customized by hand to give it
  more of that sexiness and edge, while remaining classic and sophisticated:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ania-a/lullaby/\r\n\r\nI'm
  hoping you guys can help me find more sources of inspiration for the direction I'm
  trying to go.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    represented: A new fan at a recent show described their sound as being \"Harder
    than it needs to be, but more beautiful than it should be.\"\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    also by a Polish designer) although the latter might be too \"girly\".\r\n\r\n*

  body: Thanks guys! All of these have elements that I can pull from. I particularly
    enjoy the "f" from FF Pitu and the contrast of Matinee Idol. This gives me a lot
    more to work with. Any more ideas for inspiration are of course still welcome
    :)
