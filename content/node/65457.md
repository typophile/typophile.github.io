  body: "Sigh\u2026the weird stupid world of antitrust. Years of time and millions
    of dollars wasted to achieve one more annoying Windows dialog box that users will
    ignore and maybe a branded Firefox derivative on some desktops. What a pathetic
    waste. The USA and EU should have just given huge grants to some of the great
    potential competitors that were showing real promise when this legal nightmare
    started. Just think about the money our schools would be saving on software if
    Mandrake, SuSE, and StarDivision had been able to keep up the pace they had in
    1998. \r\n\r\nAnd at the same time the governments are tripping over themselves
    to bail out failed car companies and locking out all the bright young talent trying
    to bring people what they really want. I just want to curl up under a blanket
    with Marcus Aurelius and a bottle of whiskey."

  body: David, perhaps you jest, but I think grappa would suit the Font Bureau brand
    admirably, and I thoroughly encourage you to pursue this.
