  eye magazine? The author seems to have a very skewed perspective on originality.
  I was wondering if he or she was a typophile and if so it would be interesting to
  discuss the article further.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    to scan and post the PDF or is there already a weblink to the article somewhere"

    to afford in the US. "

  body: "Apologies the post is exclusive to those who read the magazine, I'm afraid
    I have no means of posting it because the magazine is retained by the library
    which is not equipped with scanners. I will look into Martin Majoor though, perhaps
    it will throw some light on things. In the article he presents an italic rather
    than oblique version of Akzidenz based on Walbaum italic. Maybe I can get some
    images.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame Eye is so expensive/difficult to obtain. I only have
    access to it through a well subscribed library."
