  body: Chris, Suitcase XI allows you to create and assign your own keywords. I&#39;ve
    used this feature for similar purposes myself. I think you&#39;ll find it works
    quite well. I&#39;m not sure if the other font management software currently available
    has this feature. If you Google and advance search using typophile.com as the
    URL and search for &#34;font manager&#34; or &#34;font management&#34; you will
    find quite a few other discussions about font management software.
