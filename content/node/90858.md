body: "I am working on an exhibit of Spanish masterpieces (Goya, Picasso, Vel\xE1zquez,
  El Greco, and Dal\xED) for an art museum in the US. After looking at the works and
  discussing the themes of the show, I am looking for a roman with a lyrical abruptness,
  good stroke variation, and strong italic/calligraphic qualities.\r\n\r\nMy problem
  is that I keep finding myself drawn to the typeface <a href=\"http://bayfonts.com/advanced_search_result.php?search_in_description=1&keywords=dolphin&x=0&y=0\">Dolphin</a>.
  I really love the way some letters are drawn (a, q, l, n, u, p\u2026) and the large
  x-height. The font has a lot of technical issues though, like poor kerning, oddly-drawn
  characters (v, y, z\u2026), horrible italics, and caps that are mismatched to the
  lowercase. I am also troubled by the typeface because I can\u2019t find any information
  about it aside from the fact that it comes from a foundry of dubious integrity.\r\n\r\nI
  have looked at a few fonts that come close to what I am looking for, but none are
  home runs. The types from <a href=\"http://vllg.com/foundries/Feliciano#panel=news-gallery\">Feliciano</a>
  are very Spanish, but too restrained. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/pampatype/rayuela_family_ot/\">Rayuela</a>
  by Alejandro Lo Celso, and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/nueva_std_volume/\">Nueva</a>
  by Carol Twombly are the front-runners so far. Mexica, from <a href=\"http://www.kimeratype.com/\">Kimera</a>,
  is close, but a bit too flamboyant.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has more information about
  Bay Animation or the origins of Dolphin, I\u2019m very interested in hearing it.
  It might make the giant effort needed to make Dolphin work worth it.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
  I am open to suggestions for alternatives. Are there alternatives besides a custom
  font? I do have a preference for OpenType fonts, but it is not a restriction.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    main thing BTW is to figure out how much text\r\nyou need the font to carry; generally
    speaking the\r\nmore expressive the font the more tiring it is in\r\nterms of
    reading for extended periods. Delphin for\r\nexample is not really a text font.\r\n\r\nFeliciano:
    to me his work is more... continental.\r\nEudald for example is a revival of fonts
    from an\r\nold German/Dutch type designer, Fleischmann.\r\n\r\nRayuela is a good
    choice, and quite \"texty\".\r\n\r\nAvoid Nueva - it's more like a caricature.\r\n\r\nKimera:
    amazing work I've long admired, but\r\nI agree that his fonts are too expressive
    here.\r\n\r\nCheck here too: http://latinotype.com/\r\nBut there are many more
    high-quality \"Latino\"\r\nfoundries out there now. BTW, it all started with\r\nthe
    economic recession in Argentina in '99...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "It's interesting to me that Monotype classifies Delphin as celtic. Seeing
    it more properly kerned and with a few different characters (s, l, i, R,...),
    I can see why.\r\n\r\nI typically like to employ something a little quirky, or
    introduce some quirks, for the titling and large display type. I agree with you
    about the rest though; more sedate is better. If possible, I'd like the font to
    do double-duty--have a display and a text weight--but am comfortable pairing up
    a couple fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks for the pointer to LatinoType."

    you could find some suggestions and a bit of history for spanish typography.

  body: "riccard0, I did see that thread, which turned me on to Feliciano, but am
    not really looking for an antiqua-inspired typeface. The artists in the show span
    quite a time period (16th century El Greco and Vel\xE1zquez up to 20th for Dal\xED
    and Picasso), so I'd rather have something that looks a bit more contemporary."

  body: Nick, that is a prime idea, but I don't think I will adopt it. To me, it seems
    that practice creates stronger ties to early italics than to Spain. It is really
    the calligraphic attributes that are pulling me to Delphin, even though it is
    not suitable.

  body: "Not Spanish, but Argentine (same language): Ramiro Espinoza.\r\nHe has some
    interesting types: www.re-type.com/\r\n\r\nI think that if you choose an unexpected
    type and treat it in a special way that thoroughly integrates with your overall
    design concept, then it assumes a significant connection with the content in the
    mind of the viewer, over-riding any preconceptions they may have (or, more likely,
    an informed graphic designer may have). For instance, this Afro-Uncial:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Talking_Book_3669.jpg]\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the sleeve has Braille as well."

  body: Nick, that's a great point, and I agree with it whole-heartedly. Most typefaces
    can be made to fit into aesthetics outside of their original design intent. Maybe
    I will give Delphin another try to see if I can work it into the titling and use
    Rayuela for the long texts. Thanks for the prod in that direction.

  body: Pablo, nice work on Kaushan. Also, thanks for pointing me to Basile. It is
    an extremely beautiful type, and it may work without the swashes; I will have
    to look closer. I am always glad to find others that are creating interesting
    typefaces outside of the venues I typically see in the US.
