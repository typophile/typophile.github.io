  for the poster of the upcoming broadway show \"Of Mice and Men\" with James Franco
  and Chris O'Dowd.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know the font used for their names and the
  title \"Of Mice and Men\", or the one closest to it.\r\n\r\nYour help is very much
  appreciated !\r\n\r\nPierre-Baptiste\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/1606917_699870770058140_1885757328_n_6148.jpg]"
