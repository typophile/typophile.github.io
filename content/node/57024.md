  body: "I ended up trying Helvetica, but the lower case letter seem taller than the
    sample. The \"i\" in the Helveticas I've found have the dot at the same height
    as the top of the upper case letters, whereas the menu seems to have it shorter.
    \r\n\r\nThanks for helping"

  body: I think the differences are due to the poor pixelisation of the characters.
