  eye for  crafting logotypes, I have undertaken a simple type-kern-compare experiment
  with some of <a href=\"http://www.joefino.com\">Joe Finocchiaro's logos.</a> Keeping
  that in mind, I am trying to answer these questions based on the idea that we are
  designing a logotype based on the letters of a font originally designed for text:\r\n\r\n1.
  What what choices were made, and why?\r\n2. Kerning characters can only go so far.
  What glyph alterations can improve spacing/color? \r\n3. What are the common differences
  between type designed for text and display type of the same family?"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bankofamerica_4698.gif]\r\n\r\nHere are
    the results from my first breakdown:\r\nWhen set to default in ITC Franklin Gothic
    Demi Cond., \u201CBank of America\u201D has many holes. It looks like small type
    trying to be big. The comparison (font in red, logo in black) reveals a bolder
    weight to the logo, a wider apex to the A, extended ear of the r, raised dot of
    the i, extended ascender of the k, and an altered e.\r\n\r\nConcluded reasoning:\r\nGenerally,
    thickening the letterstroke connections helps when the logo is used at small scale.
    The widening of the A had to happen since the weights are heavier. Same with the
    r. The redesign of the e helps visually distance it from the r without physically
    moving it, thereby evening the spacing of the mer. The raised dot of the i eliminates
    the line formed by the negative space in the font. Not sure why the k was heightened.
    In the end, the logo is far more robust, confident, and than just setting the
    type in Franklin Gothic."

  body: You would do better to compare the logo with a setting of the actual typeface
    used -- "Franklin Gothic Condensed", not the ITC one.

  body: I have a problem with your project. Ask yourself is this logo signage or used
    as printed material. The spacing has to be different for these applications. Its
    not black and white. Its about enviroment.

    the website I checked out, it looks like a truly indispensable resource. \r\n\r\nNick,
    thanks- I should know better than to blindly pick from what was available on my
    computer. \r\n\r\nDan, while I am aware that spacing must be different for specific
    types of projects, my goal is to learn how to improve type in general. Of course,
    there is no universal solution, and my resources on the project's background is
    limited. I can only work with what I have, and from that I hope to gain at least
    some understanding on the technicalities.\r\n"

    you familiar with the MOMA typeface redesign? It was done recently, by Matthew
    Carter, and is a reworking of Franklin Gothic, with variants for text and display
    if I recall correctly, which speaks to Dan's point about context."

  body: You hit on some great observations here koleslaw. Yes in fact you are right...type
    designed for smaller sizes has less contrast between thick and thin. Large display
    type can have high contrast, be tightly spaced and still be quite legible but
    at smaller point sizes the spacing and letter weight have to be adjusted to compensate
    for the small size. But the goal is that when comparing the two at <em>different</em>
    sizes, they will <em>appear</em> to be identical. Like an optical illusion. This
    probably also has something to do (I would guess) with why the "k" is higher on
    the one. It reminds me of how the ancient Greeks used to carve the columns on
    their temples so that the sides actually bowed outwards slighty. This made the
    sides appear perfectly straight...a truly straight column would look concave.
    (or so they say).
