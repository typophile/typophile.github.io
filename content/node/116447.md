    I also know designer of [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/9043067/15115-15-Years-115-Projects-Book|this
    project]] Mash Creative Mark Bloom's already demonstrated he had the ability to
    design his own font as he did with [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/1998273/RM-Regular-Font|RM
    Regular]] on [[https://www.behance.net/gallery/977603/Royal-Mail-Rethink-for-ICON-magazine|Royal
    Mail rethink]]. So may be he created another bespoke type font his '15/115 - 15
    Years 115 Projects' book.\r\nThe only thing I could suggest is to directly contact
    him and if he answer, drop the answer as well."
