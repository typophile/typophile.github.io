  : http://www.ceveritt.com/images/huf.coe.3.jpg\r\n\r\nI wonder how to get the deformation
  of \"Hufnagel\", \"Custom\", and \"cycle\". I tried to do this with Illustrator
  but without success. maybe he to create the letter one by one manually, but I doubt
  it. There is necessarily a way to do it \"cleanly\"\r\n\r\nOther request :\r\n\r\nI
  want to know the name of fonts used in this link : http://www.ceveritt.com/images/huf.coe.2.jpg\r\n\r\ni'd
  really appreciate your help\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.\r\n\r\nT.\r\n\r\nPs : sorry

  body: "The embossed letters in your first image seem to use a different C for CYCLES,
    because it looks too rounded. I would guess that these letters might be hand-drawn
    and then machined. The S is not usual, but I was not able to find this in a font.\r\n\r\nIn
    your second image, the sans serif for most lettering could be Gotham from H&FJ,
    but the letters are not distinctive enough to be sure. \r\n\r\nThe large HUFNAGEL
    letters look like a Victorian-era serif, but I could not find an exact match.\r\n\r\n-

    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-billhead-1890/|LHF Billhead]]
    (1900).\r\nThe script looks handwritten to me. Have a look to some [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Script+handwritten+monoline/fonts/|\"script

    The missing sans could be a lot of thing so why not (the ubiquitous) [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008|Gotham]]."
