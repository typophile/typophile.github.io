body: "Hi,\r\nI know fontlab is buggy, but this one is new to me. Whenever I click
  through the \"editing layers\" palette (the standard view with the 5 main layers)
  after a couple of clicks one or another layer locks up. Then I have to switch into
  the \"advanced\" layer section and unlock the layers. Its a pain! \r\n\r\nMy guess
  is that something in the pref files has been messed up, but i dont really want to
  reset them since all my customized settings would be lost, too. The same would be
  the case with reinstalling FontLab. \r\n\r\nAny advice anyone?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nHenning"
