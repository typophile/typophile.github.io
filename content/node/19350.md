  but as far as I can see it has no fi (or other f-) ligature(s). I find this very
  strange, since I've seen examples of Trinit\xE9 in use with the fi- and fl-ligatures.
  The other fonts from Ensched\xE9 seems to have several f-ligatures. \r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have a point of view on this? Thank you!"

    closes up to the i, j, l, h, k and b\r\nif the glyphs are set without letterspacing."

  body: "I tought Trinit\xE9 was so well designed that it didn't need any ligatures.
    With the n\xB02 the stem of the lowercase f always covers the point of the i.\r\n\r\nYou
    can see it clearly on the sample sheet (http://www.teff.nl/fonts/trinite/pdf/trinite_a3_print-600.pdf)."
