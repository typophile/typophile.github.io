body: "I'm hoping I've posted this in the right section. (If not please move my topic!
  I would greatly appreciate!) I was talking a designer and that has never used the
  feature to lock the paragraph(in InDesign) to the baseline grid. I got to thinking
  because looking at the baseline grid right after you click the lock feature it ruins
  the leading set up. I know that you need to change the baseline grid first to adjust
  to the leading of the body copy text, but then I had this project where I made so
  many lines for the baseline grid in order to accommodate the text to fit the layout
  and not have the leading have wide gaps which would have given a lot of space between
  each line. I started to think is it really necessary to align text boxes to the
  baseline grid for page layout or is just modifying the leading and text size actually
  enough? Is there information about the why the baseline grid would be necessary
  or why we should lock the text boxes to it or why we shouldn't?\r\n\r\n What are
  your thoughts on this?"

  body: Other than defining a vertical rhythm, aligning to the baseline grid is especially
    useful in multi-column layouts.

    the main body text, a baseline grid can create problems. Some facility with arithmetic
    is a job requirement for typographers :-)\r\n"

    up ala a newspaper or magazine article. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, it can be useful,
    but you also need to trust your aesthetic judgement. "

  body: "I find a carefully considered baseline grid very useful for making aesthetic
    decisions and for assisting in precise work. But it is a guideline only, not a
    Procrustean bed; <em>locking</em> to baseline grid is too tyrannical for my purposes,
    and I usually recommend against it to designers I\u2019ve trained.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve
    discussed this topic before (probably multiple times), so I won\u2019t repeat
    myself. You can Google site:typophile for \u201Cbaseline grid\u201D and probably
    come up with several.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s one previous discussion that evolves
    into quite a discussion about baseline grids between Jan Schmoeger (paragraph),
    Charles Ellertson, and myself about various strategies we use (mostly for book
    design, in the case of Charles and me, anyway):\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/55212"

  body: Snapping to the baseline grid is just another tool in the toolbox. A big,
    heavy tool. And, sometimes, that's exactly what's called for.
