body: "I've got a Blogspot account for one of my blogs and it's time to find a new
  template for it. Ideally, I'd like to move up to Wordpress but I don't have the
  means to do that at the moment. So I'm looking for a new Blogger template - problem
  is, all of the templates that I've seen online for Blogger are pretty bad. The layouts
  are usually awful, with too much focus on flashy graphics and not enough on good
  design or typography. I'm a fan of Allan Cole's Wordpress templates - alas, none
  of his are available for Blogger. \r\n\r\nSo I thought I'd throw this question out
  there - does anyone know of some well-designed Blogger templates? Many thanks in
  advance."

    my own site and my tumblr for a while now. It is actually a lot of fun.
