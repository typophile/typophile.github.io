body: Hey guys, <BR> <BR>I was wondering what these typefaces are on <a href="http://photos8.flickr.com/6809157_bdbc1a7d08.jpg">this
  Sleepy Beauty poster</a>. I know the type in the middle is hand-done, but the rest
  I&#39;m not too sure on. <BR> <BR>Maybe the sans serif is a condensed version of
  Franklin Gothic? As for the serif, I want to say Clarendon Light, but I&#39;m not
  sure if it existed during that time. <BR> <BR><a href="http://photos8.flickr.com/6809156_51dabcc92a.jpg">Serif

  body: Based on the form of the &#39;w&#39;, I&#39;m going to guess that the particular
    cut was Fortune Light &#40;later called Fortuna&#41; by Bauer. Unfortunately,
    I can&#39;t find any online source; the medium weight is in the imports Appendix
    of McGrew. <BR> <BR>The sans is just a bit rounder than Alternate Gothic &#40;which
    was the original ATF condensed gothic designed to harmonize with Franklin&#41;,
    but I can&#39;t find the cut that nails it. There were an awful lot of these floating
    around then.
