  this building from 1984. The font is Futura, exept the capital M. This is more Avant
  Garde, exept for the pointed tops of the M.\r\nSo, i would like to know if, this
  M is a known variation of the Futura or a customization by the designer.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help."

    just curious. The M keeps puzzling me, because the Futura M is pointed at the
    bottom too, but this M not."
