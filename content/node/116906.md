  body: "so far I found similar fonts:\r\nKoshgarian Bold - too slim and airy and
    \"a\" doesn't have rounded bottom right corner\r\nHighlandGothicFLF Bold - closest
    I have found -  \"a\" and \"s\" should be more square in shape though and again
    \"a\" doesn't have rounded bottom right corner\r\n"
