body: I would appreciate any help locating the font used in the weber logo. It can
  be found in the upper left corner on <a href="http://www.weber.com" target="_blank">www.weber.com</a>.  I
  have searched relentlessly and have had no success, I have found similiarities in
  the font Modula Regular. The spurs are somewhat similiar but the e is a little different.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for your help!

  body: This is almost definetely a custom designed logo which may have started life
    as something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/compacta/ef-light/testdrive.html?s=weber&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">compacta</a> or swiss 911 with modifications to the w and b. You
    may also want to check out <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aurora/condensed/testdrive.html?s=weber&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">aurora condensed</a> for something similar.  Or they may simply
    have drawn it from scratch. Either way, I think they&#39;ve modified their earlier
    logo and simply added little serifs.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s their original and modified
    logos. These larger images may also help someone else suggest something. I hope
    this helps <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
