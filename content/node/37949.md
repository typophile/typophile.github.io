body: "For some reason FontExplorer X's AutoLoad keeps popping up in my System Preferences
  > Accounts > Login Items. Unfortenately this causes my Mac to hang during the startup
  process and forces me to start up in Safe Mode, remove the AutoLoad from the Login
  items and start up in normal mode again.\r\nEven thought I disabled all auto-activation
  functionality in FontExplorer X's preferences the damned thing keeps showing up.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nArtur"

  body: "Artur - your problem is different from mine, but you might try what I did,
    delete FontExplorer + the preferences file, and reinstall. \r\n\r\nI don't mind
    Autoload even tho it does hang the startup a bit.\r\n\r\nYou can turn it off in
    Preferences tho."
