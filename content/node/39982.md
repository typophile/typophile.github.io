  belongs. But, if you have a designer or typographer in your life that loves posters
  you might consider International Poster. They have prices that are somewhat affordable
  and could certainly be considered an investment. <a href=\"http://www.internationalposter.com/search-results.aspx?defaultview=browse&price=low&title=Under%20$250\">Gifts
  from $20 to $200</a>. They also have a nice little <a href=\"http://www.internationalposter.com/reference-books/general-books-on-posters.aspx\">selection
  of books</a> in regards to the topic!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
