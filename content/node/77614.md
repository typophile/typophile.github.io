  with some decisions.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI'm thinking about making a set of wood
  letterpress blocks; I was hoping there might be someone here who can guide me as
  to the things I'm considering. The type of wood for a start, soft or hard- but I'm
  going to be filing this material so a harder wood will make the project take forever,
  but a soft wood might be naff with inks- I need to be able to clean the set once
  it's done.\r\n\r\nThe actual size and weight, and I suppose the typeface itself
  (if anyone has a special self designed one, I'd consider using it as a template!)
  are still undecided - I am literally just beginning to think about it. Who knows,
  we could work on it as a collective to get it done faster!\r\n\r\nI want to make
  it fully by hand- I dont want to use sanders or engravers to rout out the grains.
  I also want to finish it by the end of 2011."

    You can read all about it here:\r\nhttp://nicksherman.com/design/Intercut/\r\n\r\nHopefully
    you can get some useful information from that. I'll be curious to see how your
    project goes \u2013 good luck!"
