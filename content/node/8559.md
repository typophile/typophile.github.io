body: 'hello and good typography year &#40; 2002 &#41; to all. This is the other part
  of project, the width Condensed of my RS Van. This apresentation show the differents
  weights for different kinds of soluction in the same family. The x-eight is extra
  tall and the stress of letters are vertical. I  corrected the lc/g which is better
  for small sizes. I had been finnished the <BR>expessures for use as a display font
  but I must correct tham for print to the future. Any comments? Thank&#39;s for the
  last advices &#40; Van Expanded &#41; which give other perception for continue my
  work. Regards to all. / Ricardo Santos <BR> <BR>GIF / JPG: <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/615.jpg"

  body: ' I have been exposed... <BR> <BR>The lc &#34;g&#34; is my favorite Latin
    character, maybe &#42;because&#42; it&#39;s also the most challenging &#40;in
    its optimal -bicameral- form&#41;. In terms of trickiness, it&#39;s a distant
    first place - no other character comes remotely close &#40;the classical, splayed
    UC &#34;M&#34; is pretty tough too, but much of it is more technical than aesthetic&#41;.
    If you look carefully, you&#39;ll see that an alarming proportion of fonts which
    are just fine otherwise... happen to have a weak &#34;g&#34;! In some &#91;rare&#93;
    cases you can see that the designer realized he was out of his league, and took
    an existing &#34;g&#34; from a master designer and modified it. <BR> <BR>Other
    reasons I focus on the &#91;bicameral&#93; &#34;g&#34;: <BR>1. It&#39;s a model
    of how best to promote readability in a font &#40;or more accurately, an alphabet&#41;.
    <BR>2. I happen to think its true potential is still largely obscured, in two
    ways: the stroke weight distribution of its lower stroke is typically very unnatural
    in most fonts &#40;we&#39;re &#91;superficially&#93; used to the awkwardness,
    but that doesn&#39;t make it OK for the reader&#41;; closing the lower bowl is
    detrimental &#40;it makes the structure too different than the rest of the alphabet&#41;,
    but very few designs enjoy an open-bottom form. <BR> <BR>BTW, you guys are lucky:
    Armenian has about a dozen characters of the trickiness-level of the &#34;g&#34;...

    for signage. baring this in mind - would it be worth having some lining figures
    also? just a thought... <BR> <BR>great stuff

    like you can see on my last samples but in this new restyling of the font I have
    just finished the new set of linning figures so I will post soon. Thank

    I made yestarday a correction on the oblique ligature &#40;ae&#41;, I use and
    transform a slant l/c &#40;a&#41; from regular weight to construct  this letter
    &#40;like Randy suggest too&#41;. I think this option are better than the last
    version which created some confusion on legibility. Thank

    like to ask you about the wrong spancing of the capitals &#34;P&#34; and R&#34;,
    where you saw that situation on the .gif or on PDF sample?. One more time thank&#39;s

  body: Hmm, are they different versions &#40;the one in your <BR>GIF and the one
    in your PDF&#41;? <BR>I&#39;m looking at your PDF again, anyway. Looks like  <BR>the
    spacing of P and R in your italic versions  <BR>are fine. In the roman versions,
    I think the right <BR>sidebearing could be reduced just a little.
