  body: "It also looks a lot like ITC Milano Roman, which Herb Lubalin would have
    probably have used, although it was designed by Tom Carnase and Ronnie Bonder.
    It has ampersands similar to both in the graphic, and a similar exclamation mark.
    I have it in the old Letterpress 5.0 CD from Image Club Graphics. Don't know if
    anyone still carries it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "<em> Pistilli Roman</em>\r\n\r\nThat's what I was going to say, before I
    finished reading the thread. :-)\r\n\r\nA very close alternative is Phil Martin's
    version of Pistilli Roman called <a href=\"http://www.roostertypes.com/view_fullfont.asp?catalogid=3192&issingle=yes\">Didoni</a>.
    Ironically, the slew of alternate characters he did which made his version different
    are not present in the URW digitization. The ampersand in the sample, which was
    an alternate in both Pistilli Roman and Didoni, is also not present."
