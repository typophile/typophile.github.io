  but I don't know where to buy it.\r\n\r\nThe Font Bureau offered us a student discount,
  but it's still not too cheap. On the other hand, the FontShop offers Miller Display
  in more styles and for less cash. \r\n\r\nWhat's the difference here, am I missing
  something important?\r\n\r\nDave"

  body: The price should be about the same. The Font Bureau discounts as you add more
    weights (you may have missed volume discounts in their cart). And both outfits
    offer a student discount. In other words, you won't get these fonts cheaper no
    matter where you buy it. Just shop where you feel comfortable.

  body: "The primary difference between Miller Headline and Miller Display is that
    the Headline version is narrower (about 92%) and fitted more tightly to better
    suit \u2014 what else? \u2014 newspaper headlines (originally for the Boston Globe,
    I believe).\r\n\r\nMiller Headline is not part of the Retail library, so you won't
    find it available for license from any of FB's resellers. \r\n\r\nHere's a direct
    comparison of the two (Display above, Headline below).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MillerDis_Hea_5023.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n--
