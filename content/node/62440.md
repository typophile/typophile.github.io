body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nSince applying typography to my work, it has occurred to me that
  Microsoft Word isn't very efficient. For example, I am using Myriad Pro and I find
  myself manually adjusting letter spacing and letter kerning all of the time.\r\n\r\nBeing
  that I am relatively inexperienced in matters of typography, it seemed reasonable
  to assume that proper typographers would know of more efficient work flows. Could
  you please share your thoughts on text editors?\r\n\r\nI cannot justify the cost
  of InDesign. However, I welcome your thoughts on all software as it could save me
  many hours trying free approaches such as [[http://www.freeserifsoftware.com/software/pageplus/|Serif
  PagePlus]].\r\n\r\nThanks for your input, it is appreciated and I apologise for
  being a novice :)"

    an alternate to InDesign.\r\n\r\nIn regards to inexpensive word processors that
    have some nice OT features, Pages is my recommendation."

    looks interesting. Although I haven't used it.

    of MacOS. Incidentally, you can install cracked versions of MacOS on a standard
    PC :)\r\n\r\nI have just given Serif PagePlus a chance and sadly, it cannot import
    Microsoft Word projects. Furthermore, Microsoft Publisher crashes when trying
    to render my Microsoft Word project with all the small kernings. Is all my hard
    work trapped inside this horrendous application?"

    reset the kerning and see if the new app gives you a better appearance.\r\nAlso
    keep in mind that the only way to really see kerning issues is printing."

  body: "Glen, when you say you're applying typography to your work, do you mean you're
    being paid to design with type? If you are, you're going to have to bite the bullet
    and get InDesign sooner or later anyway. \r\n\r\nIf you're self-employed, you
    may be able to get a tax deduction. (You can in the US, I don't know what the
    rules are in the UK.)\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, your principal occupation
    is something else, and you're simply frustrated that MS Word has a thousand features
    you don't want and none of the features you do want--well, join the club.\r\n
    \r\nYou can still differentiate your work from the careless stuff you see everywhere.
    Use styles rather than manual formatting, and override the default \"based on
    Normal.\" Specify line spacing in points instead of \"single,\" and always use
    \"space above/below\" in the Paragraph menu to create space around headings, lists,
    etc. You'd be surprised how professional you can make MS Word look."

  body: "Define a style or styles with the spacing and kerning the way you want. You're
    not limited to Word's built-in styles. You can even define character styles that
    won't affect the entire paragraph. Or just change the Normal style and everything
    based on it will automatically change, too. Then allow Word to save the changes
    in your normal.dot file if it asks.\r\n\r\nLater edit: You don't have to create
    completely new styles -- you can modify Word's built-in styles any way you want
    to, except they can't be renamed."

  body: "Hi PublishingMojo :)\r\n\r\nI found your question very difficult to answer!
    In a nutshell, I am intentionally exposing myself to the fullness of typography
    so that I can claim to know it. I do not yet make that claim :)\r\n\r\nThanks
    to everyone for their tips. I found Microsoft can randomly change a character's
    rendered size for inexplicable reasons. I am not referring to the specified font
    size, which remains constant."

    seen either in Word.) Is the whole character scaled up or down in size, or is
    this perhaps the clipping that happens when the line spacing is less than the
    font point size?\r\n"
