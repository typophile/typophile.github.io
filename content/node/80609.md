  and Identity. I am writing a discourse on the usage of typographic terminology.
  I asked this question to my professors and they had different opinions.\r\n \r\nWhat
  I have understood is that a \u2018typeface\u2019 is the design of the alphabet-the
  shape of the letters that make up the typestyle. The letters, numbers, and symbols
  that make up a design of the type. So Times New Roman Regular is a typeface.\r\n\r\n\u2018Font\u2019
  is the digital file that contains/describes the typeface. Its name is derived from
  the word \u2018fount\u2019 and it is a collection or a family of all the different
  styles and sizes of a typeface. So, Times New Roman (Italic, Regular, Bold and Bold
  Italic) would be a font.\r\n\r\nAny help will do, and is really appreciated.\r\nThanks.
  \r\n"
