  body: "It has a <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/13775/itcfranklingothicbookcondensed-font.html\">Book
    Condensed</a> weight. Maybe that is light enough for you? Are you looking for
    a lighter weight to pair with that?\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the whole ITC Franklin
    Gothic family, which has 20 parts: http://www.linotype.com/655/itcfranklingothic-family.html\r\n\r\nQuite
    similar to that is <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/89881/lightlinegothic-family.html\">Lightline
    Gothic</a>, also originally by [[Morris Fuller Benton]]. It looks both Light and
    Condensed to me. Maybe it'd hit the spot?\r\n\r\n"
