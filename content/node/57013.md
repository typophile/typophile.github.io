body: "Sorry for cross-posting, I posted this on the Fontlab forum yesterday but didn't
  get any response so I thought I'd try here.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly new to the details
  of OpenType, and I wonder if anyone here can help me. Just a quick intro to get
  some context for the question: Urdu traditionally uses a very complex variant of
  Arabic script called '[[Nastaliq|Nastaleeq]]' (or any number of alternative spellings!)
  where words are written sloping downwards from right-to-left, so initial characters
  are small and high-up, with final characters big and swirly at the bottom. This
  makes it hard to specify technically, and there is no Unicode standard for the process
  AFAIK. \r\n\r\nWe've got a couple of Urdu fonts here, one of which uses an enormous
  number of ligatures (about 10,000 of them), another of which uses more standard
  Arabic joining rules, but with far more variants of each character. What I'm trying
  to do is find where in the font the information is stored for these two processes.
  Bringing the fonts into FontLab Studio, the features tables aren't terribly helpful
  - here's a sample from rlig:\r\n\r\nlookup rlig54 {\r\n} rlig54;\r\n\r\nAm I looking
  in the right place? The fonts work great in Word, so the features must be working
  correctly.\r\n\r\nIn case it helps, the two fonts are Jamil Noori Nastaleeq and
  Nafees Nastaleeq\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice"

  body: "FontLab is not a good choice for examining Arabic fonts, as it lacks all
    support for contextual alternates.\r\n\r\nTry DTL's OTMaster -- even the free
    Light version [[http://www.fonttools.org|(download)]] is able to display the tables.
    It's not as readable as Adobe's OpenType script notation, but then again, that
    does not support context alternates either.\r\n\r\nWhich makes some sense, as
    FontLab is built around Adobe's font tools. Arabic fonts get their smarts from
    Microsoft's VOLT tool (reportedly, even Adobe's fonts).\r\n\r\n\r\nOTMaster displays
    the OT information in a rough-and-ready format, which means you will have to know
    everything about OpenType substitutions. I will not even mention which of the
    many, many tables you must inspect, because if you don't know, you won't know
    what you are looking it."

    for developing new features but it is not ideal for representing a \"dump\" of
    the features taken from the final font. Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/english/OTMaster_rdrct.html\">DTL
    OTMaster</a> or the free FontTools/TTX (which is bundled with <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/\">Adobe
    FDK for OpenType</a> and <a href=\"http://fonttools.sourceforge.net/\">available

    OTMaster provides a graphical representation while FontTools/TTX creates XML text
    dumps which can be viewed in any text editor. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"

  body: "Hi Danny,\r\n\r\nWe just completed a new nastaliq typeface. It's based on
    Persian, but supports the whole Arabic block in Unicode. It was designed for Urdu
    and to get the Pakistani \"flavour\" rather than the Persian one, we provide a
    series of typographic parameters in the Tasmeem interface.\r\n\r\nBTW, allow me
    to put you straight when you write: \"Urdu traditionally uses a very complex variant
    of Arabic script called \u2019Nastaleeq\u2019\".\r\n\r\nNastaliq is outrageously
    complicated if you are forced to reproduce with 15th century typesetting concepts,
    without an analysis of the internal logic of historical Arabic scripts, an aspect
    that I call \"script grammar\". That would be analogous to cloning the hand-held
    calculator without even suspecting that there is math involved - something that
    would require a massive data base with at least the outcome of all common supermarket
    additions and still miss the point of what calculating entails.\r\n\r\nThink again:
    how could nastaliq be \"very complex\" and at the same time be the script of choice
    for the majority (population wise) of the Arabic-scripted world, and why would
    there be a massive demand to adapt it for computer use?\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that
    nastaliq or naskh-i ta\u02BFl\u012Bq (slanted naskh - naskh \t<em>italic</em>)
    is an extreme simplification of traditional, pre-typographic naskh. Efficient
    and elegant at the same time. It took us 300 glyphs to cover nastaliq.\r\n\r\nAs
    a boon, for the same text well-constructed nastaliq needs only a fraction of the
    length required by ordinary computer typefaces of comparable size, allowing for
    generous line spacing to lend it elegance and legibility.\r\n\r\nWe were not the
    first to discover the straightforward simplicity of nastaliq. The first realistic
    Arabic typesetting - as opposed to the uninformed caricatures produced in the
    West and the competent, but failing experiments in the East - was based on <em>ta'l\xEEk</em>
    (ta\u02BFl\u012Bq), the Ottoman variant of nastaliq (see image, 1840's, attributed
    to Ohanis M\xFChendiso\u011Flu). It dates from the second quarter of the 19th
    century and it appeared about a quarter of a century before a comparable quality
    of naskh typography was attained.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Milo\r\nDecoType\r\nwww.decotype.com[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ottoman_Taliq_Typography_close-up_5876.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pre_muhendisyan_detail_6124.gif]"

    they are much more distinct than the monotonous repetitive shapes of the western

  body: "As a user of Arabic script day in day out, I very much appreciate the fact
    that people like Thomas Milo and those in DectoType have invested in producing
    something as good for the script as Tasmeem. I think their work have served the
    Arabic Script and the Islamic culture very much. Currently, I am in the process
    of documenting the transition of the Arabic Script from calligraphy to typography.
    Tasmeem will obviously feature in the evolution process.\r\n\r\nHowever, in researching
    the development of Tasmeem and the Arabic Calligraphic (Composition?) Engine,
    ACE, I almost always came across Thomas Milo's high acclaim of Ohanis M\xFChendiso\u011Flu
    as the real \"muhendis\" of Arabic Typography. I was not successful in finding
    any references to \"Ohanis M\xFChendiso\u011Flu\" other than those made by Thomas
    Milo. All search results have directed me back to Milo.\r\n\r\nConversely, searching
    under the topic of Arabic Typography in general returned numerous references to
    Ibrahim M\xFCteferrika who Milo refers to in one of his articles as a Hungarian
    renegade with a short lived contribution to the evolution of Arabic Typography.
    Among the Hungarians, who Ibrahim defected, one has actually celebrated M\xFCteferrika's
    contribution and provided good examples of his work on the web site:\r\n\r\nhttp://muteferrika.mtak.hu/hu/eletrajz.htm\r\n\r\nI
    will be grateful to Thomas and others who can refer me to independent sources
    on Ohanis M\xFChendiso\u011Flu so that I can better see how he relates to the
    development of Arabic Typography as opposed to what M\xFCteferrika had contributed.\r\n\r\nBest

    body: "Very interesting again. I actually didn't realize that the Arabic script
      is still alive in Malaysia. (Talk to an Iraqi and you will know how much exposure
      is important.) The geographic expanse of Arabic script sort of confirms my interest
      in contributing to its development.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm still in the simplified
      Arabic approach. Based on the typography that my eyes and the eyes of most Arabic
      script users are accustomed to, I started designing Arabic fonts in this style
      some time back. My knowledge and skills are still developing in OpenType, but
      I think I will remain with the simplified approach for the time being. I will
      not religiously defend it though, but I think the available technology and standards
      only allow as much. And I still think there is much unrealized visual and stylistic
      potential that I can explore using the simplified Arabic approach.\r\n\r\nTechnology
      accessibility is an important factor. Take ACE for example. It can do quite
      some nifty typography, but it is locked to InDesign. On the other hand OpenType
      is openly available on most, if not all, computer operating systems and it is
      the basis of web fonts too.\r\n\r\nOn a different but related note, take a look
      at the sumptuous photo below of Jawi writing in Ruq'aa I found while researching
      Jawi (thanks to  you). Just feel that ink flowing out of the nib on the nicely
      colored paper. Hear the subdued click of the nib as it goes up flying out of
      a graceful curve. I think haptics will keep paper print and writing alive for
      a long time to come.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.themalaysiantimes.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1-2247.jpg\"
