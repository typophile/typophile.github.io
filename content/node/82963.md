body: "Where does the term \u201Cpi fonts\u201D come from? And who was the first to
  use or popularize it?\r\n\r\nI always assumed it was an odd abbreviation of \u201Cpictogram\u201D,
  but it was never clear because the term is sometimes used to describe <em>any</em>
  non-alphanumeric/symbol font. If pi does indeed stand for pictogram, that would
  limit its relevance to a specific subset of symbol fonts \u2013 for example, mathematical
  symbols aren't pictograms.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't really match up with the kinds of
  fonts I typically think of when I hear the term \u201Cpi\u201D either, which tend
  to be be more technical and abstract than they are pictorial. Maybe there's a connection
  to the mathematical concept of pi?\r\n\r\nI also considered that there might be
  a connection to the letterpress concept of \u201C<a href=http://letterpressdaughter.blogspot.com/2010/05/printers-pie-pi.html>printers
  pi(e)</a>\u201D, but any connection there seems rather weak.\r\n\r\nFor whatever
  it's worth, the term doesn't show up in anything on Google books <a href=http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=pi+fonts%2Cdingbats%2Csymbol+fonts&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=0&smoothing=3>until
  about 1970</a>."

  body: Because pi fonts appear to be random collections of symbols, the term is a
    reference to "pied type," as you mention above. Typesetters could accidentally
    make "pi fonts" by dumping several different typecases all over the floor. I have
    heard this etymology from letterpress printers and others. Why do you think the
    link is "weak"?

  body: "It seemed weak to me because the concept of jumbled type seems rather distinct
    from the concept of symbol fonts. If you pied a lockup of normal type, the jumble
    would still clearly contain standard letters and numbers.\r\n\r\nYou may well
    be right, but if so I'd be curious to see an example of the term \u201Cpi\u201D
    being used to refer specifically to symbol fonts (as opposed to accidentally jumbled
    type) before 1970 or so."

  body: "The expression \u2018Pi\u2019 fonts indeed stems from the greek letter \u03C0.\r\nIn
    the days of metal typesetting, the character sets were somewhat limited. Thus,
    setting special characters (such as mathematical symbols) had to be done using
    a font of symbols, which usually contained the letter \u03C0.\r\n\r\nWhile the
    printer\u2019s pie is a nice analogy, it would only really contain a \u03C0 when
    you dropped a line including a \u2018pi\u2019 character.\r\n\r\nI noticed that
    the expression \u2018Pi fonts\u2019 is much more common in the US, while in Europe
    you\u2019d refer to dingbats or symbol fonts.\r\nProbably the term just has been
    carried along through history here, ending up in font names of e.g. Adobe and
    Linotype. \r\n\r\nThank you for bringing up that topic! I had to ask some questions
    myself before being able to answer. :) "

  body: "The \u03C0 explanation makes more sense to me, perhaps even more so in the
    context of early digital fonts where the character sets were also quite limited.\r\n\r\nI'd
    still be curious to know about when, where, and by whom the term was brought in
    to popular usage though. I can't say I've ever seen any letterpress type catalogs
    that refer to symbol fonts in general with the term \u201Cpi\u201D, which makes
    me wonder if it didn't come in to usage in that context until the digital era
    (as the Google Books results would suggest).\r\n\r\nTerms like \u201Cdingbats\u201D
    and \u201Csymbol fonts\u201D are much more common here in the US as well, but
    like you mentioned, the \u201Cpi\u201D term seems to be kept lingering with all
    the fonts from Adobe, Bitstream, etc."

  body: "Hi Nick\r\n\r\nInteresting question; have you asked around at work about
    this? I believe it is one of those \u2018transatlantic-divide\u2019 questions,
    whereby different answers are possible, according to US or UK usage.\r\n\r\nThe
    \u2018printer's pie\u2019 attribution for \u2018pi fonts\u2019 appears on p.44
    of James Felici\u2019s <a=href'http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Manual-Typography-James-Felici/dp/0321127307/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1307823705&sr=1-1'>\u2018The
    Complete Manual of Typography\u2019</a> and this is also a definition given in
    the Webster dictionary (which might be why a lot of American typos believe it,
    although I find it hard to credit \u2018pie\u2019 getting shortened to \u2018pi\u2019
    \u2013 particularly when both words sound identical).\r\n\r\nHowever, on p.128
    of Ken Garland\u2019s much earlier \u2018Illustrated Graphics Glossary\u2019 (1980)
    \u2013 the definition states <cite>\u201Cpi characters: US term for \u2018special
    sorts\u2019 or \u2018peculiars\u2019, now in use in UK due to importation of US
    photocomposition machines.\u201D</cite> Note the use of the individual noun, <em>
    character</em>, rather than the collective noun, <em>font</em>.\r\n\r\nThe introductory
    text on p.2 of the Mergenthaler Linotype catalogue of 1986 also refers to \u2018pi
    characters\u2019, where they number over 10,000 in stock, and this is the crux
    of the arguments for either Greek characters or even (abbreviated) pictograms;
    you won't find \r\n<cite> any letterpress type catalogs that refer to symbol fonts
    in general with the term \u201Cpi\u201D</cite> \u2013 because at that point there
    were never any entire fonts of \u220F. It was always a single character, borrowed,
    like so many other characters symbolising mathematical functions, from the nearest-sized
    or styled font of Greek, and I would expect this practice to pre-date any American
    printing history.\r\n\r\nPossibly, after Adobe Linotype produced the digital fonts
    called <a=href'http://www.linotype.com/1564/universalpi-family.html'>Universal-Greek
    w.Math Pi and Universal News w.Commercial Pi</a> (dates for these?) the common
    usage slipped to \u2018font\u2019 rather than \u2018character\u2019, but we\u2019d
    need more industry sources from the mid-\u201980s to corroborate this."

  body: You may be interested to know that there was an ancient style of insular monumental
    writing used in Ireland in which letters from different alphabets were mixed together
    in text. Examples can be seen in the illuminated manuscripts, including the most
    famous Book of Kells held in Trinity College Dublin, and some inscriptions. Usually
    in this style evident in the extant epigraphic examples there was a practice of
    interesting ligatures that seem to suggest ambigrams. On the inscription on the
    Ardagh Chalice, which dates from perhaps about 750 AD and is now housed in the
    National Museum of Ireland, the twelve apostles are spelt using letters from the
    Greek and Roman alphabets. I have recently noticed that this inscription also
    seems to contain Semitic letters, including a zigzag lamed three times and probably
    aleph. The Greek letter pi occurs in the inscription three times, in the names
    of the apostles Peter, Paul, and Philip. Is the insular monumental the earliest
    example of a pied script? By the way, I have read that magpies used to be called
    simply pies.
