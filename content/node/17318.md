  this simple font:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/srposter.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  know there are probably many similar to this one. However I'd like to find the exact
  font (maybe it's a really obvious one that I'm just overlooking). Sorry about the
  perspective distortion, it was like that on the poster.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for any help. :)"
