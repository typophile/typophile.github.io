  body: This reminds me of an idea I started to work out on paper a while ago, though
    I was considering the effect when tracing the same path of the <b>e</b> with a
    slanted pen. The result wasn&#39;t that attractive when extended to the rest of
    the alphabet so I dropped it. I&#39;m glad to see it works much better in a lineal
    design. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d suggest extending the shape of the lower <b>e</b> to
    as many characters as you can. The results should be more distinctive and give
    your idea good mileage. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7640.gif"
    alt="Example Modifications"> <BR> <BR>Besides this, there are lots of problems
    in the shapes of your characters. The <b>a</b> is too wide. Assuming the <b>e</b>
    is your mothership character, the bowl characters <b>bpdq</b> are too narrow.
    The arm of the <b>f</b> extends too far to the right. The dot on the <b>j</b>
    is too high or the dot on the <b>i</b> is too low. They should be the same height.
    The <b>v</b> is too narrow. The <b>w</b> needs to be redrawn to bring the slopes
    into agreement. <BR> <BR>The <b>t</b> needs attention. The crossbar is too high,
    it should be at the same height as the crossbar on the <b>f</b>. The top of the
    stem on <b>t</b> is also much higher than is conventional. Additionaly, the shape
    of the foot is not advisable; I&#39;ve tried this shape before and it never sits
    well on the baseline. Perhaps you could make this foot the same shape as the bottom
    half of the <b>e</b>. <BR> <BR>I like your idea for the distinctive bend in <b>e</b>.
    If applied with care to the rest of the alphabet, it could give you a distinct
    feel. But I&#39;d be careful about getting too carried away with exprimentation;
    it&#39;d be best to first nail the conventional san serif shapes and then work
    from there to inject your ideas.
