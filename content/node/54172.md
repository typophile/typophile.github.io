body: "<em>Le Monde</em> went through what I think is the first major design overhaul
  since November 2005 (mentioned in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16071\">this
  old thread</a>) on Monday, 26 January.\r\n\r\nThere is an <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/actualite-medias/portfolio/2009/01/23/le-monde-renove-sa-maquette_1145482_3236.html\">audio
  slideshow</a> on the <em>Le Monde</em> homepage about the redesign, narrated in
  French. There is also <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/opinions/article/2009/01/24/renovation-par-eric-fottorino_1146007_3232.html#ens_id=1142910\">an
  editorial</a> about the redesign, also in French. However, neither goes into any
  real detail about the typographical aspect of the redesign. In fact, I am having
  trouble finding any in-depth information at all about this redesign.\r\n\r\nI finally
  have this week's issues of <em>Le Monde</em> in my hands, and I can see that <a
  href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Rocky\">Rocky</a> and Fenway by Matthew Carter
  are no longer, although <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans\">Benton
  Sans</a> has been retained. So what are the new typefaces for headlines and body
  text? Actually, they seem to be using the same serif typeface for both headlines
  and body text; I'm not even sure they are different cuts. I haven't been able to
  identify the typeface, but I'm sure someone here can tell me (or should I make a
  separate request at the Type ID forum?).\r\n\r\nHas anyone else seen the redesign?
  What do you think of the new typeface?"

  body: "Thanks Jan! Both the headline and body text are indeed TheAntiqua. I think
    it's the regular weight of TheAntiqua B used for both; the headline is of course
    tightly tracked and might be slightly condensed. I was pretty sure I'd seen the
    typeface before, but I started doubting when I couldn't come up with anything.\r\n\r\nIn
    headlines, TheAntiqua comes across as more friendly to me than the somewhat austere
    Rocky, perhaps too informal. I guess it's the lack of sharp corners. Maybe I'm
    just used to headlines employing display cuts with greater stroke contrast and
    fine details."
