  body: That&#39;s custom airbrush script, probably done straight in Photoshop <BR>and
    made to be &#34;pretend airbrushed&#34;. <BR> <BR>The entire piece looks like
    the work of Aztlan, aka Fifth Sun. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.aztlangraphics.com/"

  body: In Harlem, USA there is a low rider bicycle club. They make their own bicycles,
    get them cromed and ride them around to show off. They are cool! I first saw them
    at the Puerto Rican parade about eight years ago.
