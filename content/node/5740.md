body: I was asked to design a logo for the 2004 election. The group &#34;Swing the
  State&#34; is a non-profit grassroots campaign to beat Bush in 2004.  <BR>The goal
  of the campaign is to address the various undecided Swing States. People affiliated
  with the organization will travel to these states and try and get as many people
  registered to vote as possible, as well as try and pursuade &#34;on the fence voters&#34;
  to vote democratic. I&#39;d love to here the forums opinions on this logo. <BR>

  body: 'I like it. When I read your description I wasn&#39;t wild for the phrase
    &#34;Swing the State&#34; &#40;swing can take on all kinds of double entrendre
    meanings&#41;. The design you came up with is simple, clean and conveys the message
    that your vote matters. The more I look at it the more I like it. One thing though,
    and it may not matter, but it doesn&#39;t say vote democrat. It could just as
    easily be used by people trying to swing the state republican. I have no suggestion  as
    to how to imlpy vote democrat other than adding a donkey but that would be assinine.   <BR>:

  body: 'I agree with your last statement, Kirsten, with one caveat: There is actually
    a very subtle hint that it&#39;s democratic -- at election time, when they divide
    the states up based on which party won them, typically Democrats are indicated
    with blue and Republicans with red.'

  body: 'Re: the color, I suspected as much but to be honest I always forget which
    color is for which party. Is it &#34;R&#34;ed for &#34;R&#34;epublician? Or should
    they be blue for all the blue chip stock they have and staid blue suits they wear?
    Don&#39;t mind me I&#39;m just being silly and this is a fun deversion from what
    I&#39;m really supposed to be working on. Is red revolutionary or reactionary?
    Opps there I go again. Bottom line - terrific logo David.'

  body: David, Since its a check mark maybe put a box in the background also It might
    be nice if the check mark were more casual looking as if it were done by hand.
    It feels a little cold and mechanical.

  body: I like it as is. Nice and simple. I think the blue gets the deomcratic swing
    across just fine.
