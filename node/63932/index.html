What makes a mac better for designing than a pc?

I do web graphics so wouldn't it be a better idea to view my designs in windows (the os that more people will be using to view the page).

Would an old power mac g5 with a dualcore 2.3 processor be any good?
Otherwise I am going to do a custom core i7 build.

It just seems that for the money I can get a much better pc, and I do not see how pixels look any better on a mac.

Please let me know your thoughts. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm with Ivan. For most users, there has been virtually no reason to keep waging the Holy OS Wars for a few years now (except some people seem to think it's fun).

That said, in the case of the original poster I can actually think of one good reason for a Mac: It's very easy now to run Windows on Mac as well, so you essentially get two OSes on one box – which is a definite advantage for testing web designs. (But this will only work remotely well if you get an Intel-based Mac, i.e. newer than a G5.) Your call to decide if that's worth the additional cost to you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think one of the main reasons to get a Mac if you're a designer is so you are more marketable when looking for jobs. I know it's not not necessarily the same elsewhere, but in the US, Macs are the standard for design. I've never been in an ad agency or in-house design department that used anything else. Sure, the programs are going to operate more or less the same, but really knowing the computer, especially in in-house design jobs where you're at places with IT departments that only know Windows, is a HUGE plus.

If you're just planning on working on your own, I suppose it doesn't matter much, but if you're looking for a job, or if you want to more easily collaborate with most other designers, the advantages become pretty clear.</div>

Which ever you choose, It's just a glorified pencil & filing cabinet :o)

I use a PC, because that's what I'm use to. 

I once cold started my laptop in the presence of a Mac devotee… It sent him into a fit of "Oh my gawd, PC's are soooo sloooowww, how can you possibly live with that… your life is melting away while you wait for it to boot up, dood" Now, I was able to comfortably ignore him, because I was aware that a priority of Steve Jobs' was to have Macs boot-up fast. OK, Whatever. That's nice, but I am able to cope the slow start up my PC laptop is apparently cursed with by planning something else constructive to do with the extra 30 seconds or so it takes to boot up. And I have learned to just put it into sleep mode if I am going to meet with someone who uses a Mac, so it just starts up instantly. :o)

That way you retain the investment you've made in Windows apps and you're able test your web dev work in browsers cross-platform while minimizing your future landfill footprint. The price difference argument seems somewhat ridiculous. Perhaps price is important to a hobbyist or home user but as a practicing graphic designer you could add $1 to your hourly rate and you'd cover the Mac-tax in a couple of months.</div>

the discussion is a waste of time, in the same
way that all religious wars are a waste of time.

but there's a reason design shops use macs.

and there's a reason that, if you switch to mac,
you will never go back to the land of windows.

<cite>It’s very easy now to run Windows on Mac as well, so you essentially get two OSes on one box – which is a definite advantage for testing web designs.</cite>

Mainly with regard to the text rendering, but I doubt, that the differences of the CSS interpreter of the browsers of both platforms are still important with regard to a buying-decision, if they ever were. Aren’t the bugs of the very old browser versions, namely the bugs of the IE, well known and documented?

And keep in mind, how many people use a Mac:
http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp
(It’s growing.)

And there seem to be services, that make screenshots of your design on different platforms:
http://www.browsercam.com/Default2.aspx

Perhaps there are more, less expensive or free services.

Apple disallows the development of Mac emulators, as far as I know. Not very sympathetic.

I would think about buying a used Mac notebook and a new PC.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While one can run OSX on a Windows PC, it's not officially supported (or even allowed).

As such, if you're a web developer, it's nice to have a Mac for that reason alone. You can easily test a wide range of browsers fairly easily.

That said, there aren't huge issues in the OSX browsers for the most part. You can install Safari on Windows easy enough and Firefox is pretty much the same. 

Obviously, if you want to get into iPhone dev, having a Mac is a prerequisite. 

"It just seems that for the money I can get a much better pc"

If that's how you feel, then there's your answer. It depends on your region and how much effort one wants to put into DIY. When I comparison shop, I don't usually find the Macs to be more much more expensive (if at all) for what I'm getting. You can definitely get cheaper PCs, of course, but rarely will they have the same specs/niceties. 

I use both all the time and if you really need to ask 'Mac vs. PC' then it really doesn't matter to you and/or you're just trolling for the sport of it. If you don't need to ask Mac Vs. PC it'd because you've used both and know the answer already.

I have both a PC and a Mac. Which do I prefer for general use? The PC. Which do I prefer for creative use? The Mac.

PC: Great for general use because almost all software is developed for PCs. The only software I can think of that I would use that isn't for PC is Adobe Aperture. Also, the only IM program I use is MSN, which as far as I know isn't available for Mac.

Mac: Switch on a Mac, and you forget that you're using a computer. For those that have never used a Mac, you won't understand this until you use one. Macs stay out of the way, and let you get on with what you're doing. However, as the OP has already stated, you do need to pay A LOT to get a Mac that runs current software blindingly fast.

The latest price drop combined with the awesome hardware specs had me order an iMac last week <em>pronto</em>. (The smallest model, actually -- 27" is a bit ... well, large.)

Programming under Windows is a breeze; I can kick out a console based program in mere minutes. I don't think that's quite possible on a Mac (suspiciously oogling XCode). On the other hand, I like the odd challenge, and I do look forward on Macifying some of my programs, such as [[http://typophile.com/node/45299|FontImage]].

Design-wise, it'll take some time to gather a same set of tools as I have now at my command, and <em>then</em> get used to mouse-ing through dialogs, rather than hitting tab and hotkeys ...</div>

I prefer to spend my money on something less "hardcore" and more "softcore", built with care and decent materials, with a better OS.</div>

I have used windows for ten years before switching to mac. The only times I had trouble with the switch was when I tried to do stuff the complicated way.

I do regularly use pc's now too, but I'm very glad I changed to mac. The hardware is a little bit more expensive, but that investment will pay itself back many, many times over.

I'm very nostalgic towards pc's, and I enjoy using them, but I would never go back to a pc for working. Not a chance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the info guys. I was kind of hoping that mac had some kind of magical thing I was not aware of. Also, for the people this offended sorry I was just curious and wanted to come to a place with real professionals to ask the question. 

I do quite a bit of 3d so for the money I could build an i7 machine with a

p6t mother board
i7 920 quad processor 
6gig ram
Solid state drive
(I have a very nice nvidia quadro already and a nice power supply.)

for under 1000 and I see no mac that even comes close to that price. It looks like I would be paying closer to 4000 for something that is similar.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi,

Firstly - you seem to have come under fire for asking an inappropriate question in a forum based around typography...

This question is dead my friend - It does still get peoples blood pumping though and for all the people shouting you down in here - you did get a good response.

For me- you answered the question yourself. - YOU DO 3D

I do alot of 3D - high end arch viz etc - The only option for me it so to use PC.
I simply cannot do what I need to do on a Mac.

Macs are great - no question - 
I am an architect and have refused to work at some high profile offices because I walked in to find a white office full of Macs and people wearing Thick Black Glasses claiming Form Z was the pinnacle of 3D media creation - 

A PC with all its niggles and quirks once set up the way I like it does everything I need.

3D - yep -get bags of Ram  - if you can build yourself - make sure your bits are compatible - On paper this stuff should all work. In practice you will find bits don't always sit nicely together - I spent a year once with a self build running a dual processor pc on a single chip because I had all sorts of problems connecting to the internet - it was only 1 year later i was able to work out that USB modems with my mobo meant high voltage across the mobo and a shut down.

Once I got a modem that connected with RJ45 problem solved. Its not always this simple.
I have had issues with ATI GPU's and I have had endless issues with AMD chips - I like you am into Intel

AMD for me is again not an option - I simply don't trust it.

The old - Macs are better for GFX argument (which usually comes from some tool with a 70's fro and a pair of jesus sandals underclad with brown socks - seams showing on the outside and all) IS DEAD - this was down to colour repro a long time back and Gamut etc etc. 

I use a PC i have worked in IT retail in the past - i know both
I made my choice and its nothing to do with the cache of owning a Mac - 

If a client wanted me because of what i had in my bag and not what I have in my head then I don't want to work with them. 

FLAME SUIT ON    ~(MAYBE)

		<div class="commentbody">Everyone knows design work is more creative on a Mac sheesh!!

I'm actually a fairly recent convert. I too do a lot of motion work (3d and After Effects) which (in the past) meant that PC was the way to roll. Not any more though. I'm all for Mac.

I also do a lot of print work - and still believe Macs handle larger files better. That said, and this is the major thing I think...none of the PCs I've used have come from a complete dealer (i.e, Dell etc) - where everything is put in the box knowing it all works together.

I've always found PCs to be very niggly - particularly when you've just acquired it. All sorts of peripheral issues etc. Where as, my experience with Macs has been (mostly) really straight forward.

THAT said, in the future I'll being putting on PCs for dedicated 3d work. Their price point just can't be beaten - particularly for a render farm.

I do find Apple a very annoying company, though.
Apple and whoever now makes Norton Anti-virus seem to be having a contest over who can annoy me the most with pop-ups urging me to update.
I have never, ever gotten iTunes to work right in Windows.
MSFT wants my money. Apple seems to want my soul.

I used to have qualms with PCs, but they are okay. I just do not like the way most look. Or rather:

I don't like Dell monitors.
I don't like Dell keyboards.
I don't like Dell towers.
I don't like Dell keyboards.

Dell is what surrounds me. 

But I hate most PC laptops. The aesthetic is lacking.

But Windows is fine by and large. It works for so many. I just don't have the patience to maintain it; OS X fortunately babysits me.</div>

LG Makes most of dell and macs panels. If you get a s-ips dell ultrasharp the monitors are just as good as any mac monitor. So I have no idea what you are talking about. Apple does not make good monitors especially for the price the imacs use a tn panel lol. 

Of course you can not do high end work on a dell oem because they do not make a graphic design machine.

And there's the frustration. There really isn't anything else as good. Which really says a lot about the rest of the lot. ;)

My main gripe with iTunes is the one-way nature of the concept. Computer to iPod, not in reverse. It's also cloaked in a proprietary database format that, if you're not careful, can be a gigantic pain to transfer from computer to computer. 

If the iPod/Touch weren't so damn great, we'd never put up with iTunes. ;)
