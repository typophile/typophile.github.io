    release I probably will.

    really, as like Adobe, Microsoft makes apps that take advantage of this feature.\r\n\r\n>My

    approach is somewhat problematic. Say someone embeds such a font in a Word document,
    the recipient of that document would be able to edit the content. How would they
    know that there were prohibited from editing the doc? In general it's best to
    avoid putting embedding permissions and EULAs in conflict. \r\n\r\n "

    who don't permit editable embedding (in their EULA), why not?\r\n\r\nYou want
    to reserve it as an extra-cost option?\r\n\r\nYou are concerned about security
    or other abuses?\r\n\r\nYou just oppose it as a matter of policy?"

    an organization. I think a font vendor would prefer to sell a site license. "

  body: "@Si: <em>Was actually talking about the customers.</em>\r\n\r\nSo was I.
    I assume they don't want to be bothered with replacing fonts they already have
    installed, if all that's changed is licensing.\r\n\r\n<em>I think a font vendor
    would prefer to sell a site license.</em>\r\n\r\nSpeaking as a font manufacturer/vendor,
    sure, but as I understand it most PDF documents using my fonts will not be in-house
    templates. The main reason to limit editing is so that documents that are sent
    to clients or suppliers of the licensee may not perform typesetting on the document,
    without having a license for the font. \r\n\r\nIf licensees use the documents
    as templates, on multiple terminals when they are only licensed for a few, there's
    not much I can do about that.\r\n\r\nHowever, if they attempt to do that, and
    find they can't, because the embedding bits disallow it, they will be really pissed
    of at my foundry. \r\n\r\nAnd they may well be accustomed to editable PDF functionality,
    because of the practice at Microsoft and Adobe, dishing out PDF-editable fonts
    willy-nilly, to help sell your big profit-centre products."

    fonts to embedding-savvy designers using Adobe apps and PDF produces different
    editable embedding issues compared to licensing TTFs to regular users and corporates

    \r\nI respect the restrictive licencing policy of y'all, but I strongly disapprove
    it.\r\nIn my opinion, a typeface is a program which helps convoying information.
    Therefore, a typeface is meant to use freely. That means that type designers should
    be paid much more upfront, and then, basta!, people use typefaces freely. \r\n\r\nOf
    course, a typeface could be considered, as well, as a branding material and then,
    a restrictive licencing is perfectly appropriate. \r\n\r\nA perfect policy could
    be a mix of those two conceptions, some fonts for free use and others fonts semi-exclusive.\r\n\r\n@m.
    butterick: i just bought the regular weight of FB Alix ; awesome!, how infortunate,
    however, that a free for use version (with less charset and no opentype features)
    does not exist!\r\n\r\nN.B. : i am French, so for me, it's obvious that free does
    not mean free of charge, but english is badly equiped for this subtle distinction."
