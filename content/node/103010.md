  that can come in to organize our fonts and make sure all of our computers are working
  with the same consistent library? Every computer (12 of them) has different selection,
  versions, less or more fonts, corrupt fonts, etc and no computer has a clean master
  library to copy work from.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this person exists, but if they
  do, please send me contact info or recommendations!\r\n\r\nthank you SO much! :)"
