  the RSS feeds.</li>\r\n<li>I'm 25 years old and an Art+Design BA student at DePaul
  University. Stifle your chortles, please. My school might not be reputable as an
  art school, but I'm passionate and hard-working (and something of an autodidact).</li>\r\n<li>I
  work three part time jobs: As a/the (it's complicated) lab admin for the department's
  computer labs, as the department's in-house designer/webmaster, and as an intern
  building websites for a design firm.</li>\r\n<li>I formerly studied psycholinguistics
  and cognitive neuroscience at the University of Chicago. It ended three years into
  my degree with a nervous breakdown.</li>\r\n<li>I'm a student member of aTypI and
  AIGA.</li>\r\n<li>I'm interested in: <ul> \r\n<li>Contemporary (not modern) applications
  of Bauhaus and Swiss Modernism</li>\r\n<li>Web typography (and its discontents)\r\n<li>Software
  and hardware as it applies to design</li>\r\n<li>Letterpress and serigraphy (though
  I haven't tried my hand at either yet)\r\n<li>Anywhere that design overlaps with
  psychology (which is just about everyhwere)</li>\r\n<li>Hermetic knowledge</li>\r\n<li>Parenthetical
  statements (obviously)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Fun facts:<ul>\r\n<li>I'm ambidextrous
  (or more accurately, ambisinistral).</li>\r\n<li>I don't follow sports, so don't
  ask about the bears, bulls, cubs, sox, fire, &c.</li>\r\n<li>I live in Lincoln Square.</li>\r\n<li>I'm
  a lapsed Catholic.</li>\r\n<li>I'm really hoping all these nested lists work out.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul></ul>\r\n

    you here! Welcome to the forums and I hope all's going well. \r\n\r\nFYI- Columbia
    Univ. Center for Book & Paper Arts offers letterpress classes. I've been flirting
    with enrolling myself (taking a screenprinting course now instead). It might be
    worth a look.\r\n\r\nAlso, you might check briarpress.org for letterpress information
    and resources.\r\n\r\nerin\r\npaperina inc."
