  of using Calluna for the body copy. It hits the sweet spot of not-too-expensive,
  but also professional.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/\r\n\r\nI
  also liked Livory:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/livory/\r\n\r\nI'm
  just not sure what would mix well with these for the display text. Any thoughts?
  I'm open to faces with some personality, I don't want the tone of this piece to
  be too stuffy. I'd appreciate any help."
