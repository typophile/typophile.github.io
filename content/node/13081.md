  Vertical Metrics</strong>\r\n\r\nOriginally written by [[John Hudson]] in a thread
  on [[Typophile]]:\r\n\r\n<em>[Note that the descender values in the hhea table and
  the OS/2 sTypoDescender field are properly expressed as negative integer (presuming
  the descender goes below the baseline), while the OS/2 usWinDescent value is expressed
  as a positive integer. For the purpose of the discussion below, all values are treated
  as if they were positive integers, since what matters is the sum of the values.]</em>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>The
  Discrepancy</strong>\r\n\r\nApple originally spec'd the hhea table as part of the
  TrueType spec. This includes three values for vertical metrics (despite the fact
  that the full name of the table is 'Horizontal Header'):\r\n\r\n- Ascender\r\n-
  Descender\r\n- LineGap\r\n\r\nTogether, these values determine the default linespacing
  in Mac applications that use system font metrics. [This is typical of word processing
  apps, text editors, and other apps that that do not , as a default, handle leading
  independently of font size. Page layout apps and other professional graphics software
  will typically not use the font metrics to determine linespacing, but will expect
  the user to set leading values or will calculate 'auto' leading as a percentage
  of the font size.]\r\n\r\nWhen Microsoft licensed TrueType, and began the extensions
  of the sfnt table format that would lead eventually to OpenType, they decided to
  spec their own vertical metrics values in the grab-all OS/2 table. One of the reasons
  for this was the need to be able to create fonts that had backwards compatible metrics
  with existing Windows bitmap fonts. This led to the OS/2 table containing two different
  sets of vertical metrics data:\r\n\r\n- sTypoAscender\r\n- sTypoDescender\r\n- sTypoLineGap\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n-
  usWinAscent\r\n- usWinDescent\r\n\r\nAs originally intended by Microsoft, the 'Typo'
  values were intended to be used by apps to calculate default linespacing, in exactly
  the same way as the corresponding hhea table values on the Mac. The 'usWin' values
  were intended to define clipping zones for the font, and as such were expected to
  correspond to the actual vertical extremes of the tallest and deepest glyphs in
  a font, to ensure that these would not be clipped (i.e. have pixels chopped off
  on screen).\r\n\r\nIf this intent were followed, one could obtain reliable cross-platform
  default linespacing by making the hhea vertical metrics values equal to the corresponding
  OS/2 'Typo' values.\r\n\r\nHowever, almost every Windows app developer -- including
  Microsoft's own app teams -- have incorrectly calculated default linespacing based
  on the OS/2 'usWin' values instead of the correct, 'Typo' values. It seems likely
  that this is the result of some application developers noting that using the 'usWin'
  values ensured that all glyphs in most fonts avoidec contact with any glyphs on
  lines above or below, while this was not always the case with the 'Typo' values.\r\n\r\nSo
  we're now in a complicated situation in which:\r\n\r\na) the specification clearly
  indicates that the correct way to produce cross-platform linespacing is to make
  the OS/2 'Typo' and hhea vertical metrics equivalent;\r\n\r\nb) basically all Windows
  apps calculate linespacing incorrectly;\r\n\r\nc) therefore, the only way to get
  reliable cross-platform linespacing is by deliberately ignoring the specification,
  and by making the hhea table values equivalent to the OS/2 'usWin' values.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne
  can sidestep the issue by making the sum of the OS/2 'Typo' and 'usWin' values equivalent,
  so that all three sets of values produce equivalent results. In my experience, this
  approach -- as outlined below -- will produce good results for most text faces and
  probably the majority of display faces. But display faces with abnormally long extenders
  can be a problem, because one must either clip the extenders or set all the values
  to provide clearance, which produces abnormally large linespacing. We hit this issue
  when we were making the AAT version of Zapfino that ships with Mac OS X.\r\n\r\n<strong>Best
  Practices</strong>\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the for-now unsolveable issue of such display
  faces, here are my recommendations for setting the OS/2 and hhea font metrics.\r\n\r\n1.
  OS/2 usWin values:\r\nThese should be set to determine the default linespacing,
  since this is what almost all Windows apps will actually use. For most designs,
  this will also ensure that glyphs are not clipped, since default linespacing typically
  includes enough 'leading' to provide clearance. If non-clipping is vital, you simply
  have to ensure that these values serve double-duty. If you have no very tall or
  deep glyphs that you want to avoid clipping, a good basic setting for these values
  will equal the UPM value of the font multiplied by 1.20 or 1.25, as this is a reasonable
  default leading. The actual value of the two fields should reflect the design. In
  Latin faces this will typically mean than a larger value is assigned to the usWinAscent
  field, while in some Arabic fonts the values might favour the descender. For the
  purpose of this explanation, let's assume a Latin text face with typical TT UPM
  of 2048, which we'll multiply by 1.25 (=2560) and assign like this:\r\n\r\n- usWinAscent
  = 1836\r\n- usWinDescent = 724\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Os/2 'Typo' values\r\nWe want to make
  the sum of these values equivalent to the usWin values, i.e. to add up to 2560.
  My recommendation here is to make the sum of the sTypoAscender and sTypoDescender
  equal to the font UPM value (2048), and to assign the different between this and
  2560 to the sTypoLineGap field. Again this should correspond to the design, and
  you should begin by measuring your typical ascender height and descender depth,
  e.g. measuring the lowercase d and p. Then, if the combined height of these is shorter
  than 2048, add the difference in equal amounts to the sTypoAscender and sTypoDescender.
  So let's assume that the typical height of the ascender in our example font is 1430
  and the typical descender depth is 550, i.e. a total height of 1980.\r\n\r\n2048
  - 1980 = 68 and 68 /2 = 34\r\n\r\nSo this gives us\r\n\r\n- sTypoAscender = 1464\r\n-
  sTypoDescender = 584 (actually -584)\r\n\r\nand the difference between 2048 and
  the combined usWin values of 2560 gives us\r\n\r\n- sTypoLineGap = 512\r\n\r\n\r\n3.
  hhea values\r\nNow setting the hhea values and obtaining cross-platform linespacing
  is easy, because you can simply make these values match the corresponding OS/2 'Typo'
  values:\r\n\r\n- Ascender = 1464\r\n- Descender = 584 (actually -584)\r\n- LineGap
  = 512\r\n\r\n<strong>Update</strong>\r\n\r\nUntil recently, I was recommending\r\n\r\n
  \   OS/2 TypoAscent == hhea Ascender\r\n    OS/2 TypoDescent == hhea Descender\r\n
  \   OS/2 TypoLineGap == hhea LinaGap\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    (OS/2 TypoAscent + OS/2
  TypoDescent + OS/2 TypoLineGap) ==\r\n       (OS/2 WinAscent + OS/2 WinDescent)\r\n\r\nergo\r\n\r\n
  \   (hhea Ascender + hhea Descender + hhea LinaGap) =\r\n       (OS/2 WinAscent
  + OS/2 WinDescent)\r\n\r\nBut Read Roberts at Adobe has been conducting tests on
  different Mac apps, and has found out that different apps calculate the baseline-to-baseline
  distance using different combinations of the hhea metrics, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    Mac
  FontBook\r\n    baseline-to-baseline == hhea.Ascender + hhea.lineGap + hhea.Descender\r\n\r\n
  \   Mac TextEdit, BBedit\r\n    baseline-to-baseline == hhea.Ascender + hhea.lineGap
  + hhea.Descender\r\n\r\n    Mac MS Word for OSX\r\n    baseline-to-baseline == hhea.Ascender
  + hhea.Descender\r\n\r\nIn addition, clipping is handled differently in different
  applications, and different methods are used to calculate the distance from the
  top of the text frame to the first baseline.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on this analysis,
  Read's recommendation, with which I reluctantly have to agree, is that cross-platform
  compatibility requires, the hhea metrics to be set as follows:\r\n\r\n    hhea.Ascender
  == OS/2.winAscender\r\n    hhea.Descender == OS/2.winDescender\r\n    hhea.lineGap
  = 0\r\n\r\nWhich is actually what I was recommending a few years ago, and what the
  MS Font Validator recommends, even though it is contrary to the OT spec.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Update
  to the update</strong>\r\n\r\nThe question of how best to set the hhea metrics is
  under discussion again. Microsoft have specified an fsSelection bit setting to force
  applications to use OS/2 Typo metrics instead of Win metrics, in which case it would
  seem best to leave the hhea metrics equivalent to the OS/2 Typo metrics as originally
  recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Update to the update to the update</strong> (7 June
  2003)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft have specified fsSelection bit 7 as an instruction to applications
  to use the OS/2 Typo metrics to calculate linespacing (in preference to the Win
  metrics). However, the implementation of this in Office 2007 (the first applications
  to respect the bit) is less than one would hope. The clean separation of linespacing
  from clipping is only implemented in the new math mode (used for typesetting math
  equations); elsewhere in e.g. Word, the bit is respected and the linespacing is
  calculated according to the Typo metrics, but an assumption is made that clipping
  is still constraine by line height. In effect, instead of determining the linespacing
  according to the clipping zone of the Win values, Office is now determining the
  clipping zone according to the linespacing of the Typo values. [Insert 'irony mark'
  here.]\r\n\r\nSo what is my current recommendation for setting metrics? There's
  no easy answer to that other than try to set all three sets of metrics to sum to
  the same total if at all possible, in which case it won't matter much, in terms
  of cross-platform compatibility, whether the hhea metrics mirror the OS/2 Typo metrics
  or the OS/2 Win metrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/7571\">Line
