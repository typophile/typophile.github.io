  need to compare some typefaces (the word  \"Hamburgevons1268\") that are not for
  sale like Retina (Hoefler & Frere-Jones) and telefont (Martin Majoor).\r\nDoes anyone
  here has some refences on these typefaces (outside from what is online)?\r\nI can't
  find a contact for Martin Majoor...\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    Twitter is definitely appropriate.)\r\nOr you could try Typekit. They have this
    great technology that allow you to download and install fonts in their library
    without paying for the font license as long as you are a subscriber. Of course
    you won\u2019t be able to extract them and install them elsewhere, but at least
    you have access."

      he has missed it, whether it be unintentional or intentional, send out a formal
      Email to his public address for inquiry. I would surmise that TFJ (or Martin
      Majoor), like most members of the typographic community, is kind enough to reply
      to a well-intended Email. I got my internship in a letterpress studio by this
      way too."
