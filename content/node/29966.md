body: "my knowledge on this category of faces is limited so i could use some help
  in heading in the right direction. i'm looking for faces that resemble the more
  conservative side of the OCR style of types but not necessarily monospaced. something
  more usable for paragraphs of text would be nice. the gridded and 'calculated' feel
  is what i am looking for but i'm trying to stay away from the types that scream
  computer.\r\n\r\nif anyone can suggest foundries, type designers and faces it would
  be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n_will"
