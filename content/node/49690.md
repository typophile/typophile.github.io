    Maybe we can beef the wiki up somehow.

    a link to it:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.marksimonson.com/typophile/hinting.pdf\r\n\r\nThe
    Fontographer screen shots are a bit out of date but the principles are the same
    in FontLab or whatever. \r\n\r\n(I'll remove it if anyone objects.)"

  body: By the way, the article has no date on it (not even in the PDF metadata),
    but I would guess, judging from some of the references in it, that David wrote
    it sometime between 1998 and 2001.

    at the ATypI conference in The Hague that year.

  body: Thanks, John. My guess was based on his mention of FontLab 3 (Windows version
    released in 1998) in the present tense and FontLab 4 (released in 2001) in the
    future tense. Maybe this was an updated version of his ATypI presentation?
