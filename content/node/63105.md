  body: "Yup.\r\n\r\nApparently the BBC gave a lecture in one of their local universities.
    The claim was that this font was the result of an excessive investment (I cannot
    recall the figure, maybe millions) involving extensive research into differing
    reading habits across generation gaps."

    and 'one' are too short and excluded by forum policy.

    the BBC did as my source suggests, they would have followed a design process incorporating
    fieldwork studies and large sample sizes. Everyone involved would be compensated.\r\n\r\nI
    do not know much about Jason Smith. What name did he give his font?\r\n\r\nThe
    font is not Avenir, which is similar but generally darker. The ems are different
    and the Avenir is more closed. In some ways, its a bit like comparing Helvetica
    and Arial."

    You can find out more about them on Jason Smith's company's site, FontSmith.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontsmith.com/projects/portfolio/\r\n\r\nThere
    is no way that I can see to link to a particular project in the portfolio. But
    just click on \"BBC 1\". Then, you can use the arrows next to the image to click

    all mad :-)\r\nFontsmith has probably more experience in designing fonts for TV
    brands than anyone else. Every client, TV or not, has different requirements for
    their brand. Everything is done on purpose... we are designers that's what we
    do. As for the first comment by stormbind, I don't know who gave the lecture or
    what it was all about. I can say that BBC 1 have never had a typeface designed
    specifically for them before we did one. (unprecedented) And Fontsmith do know
    what we are doing (research) :-)\r\n\r\nSeriously though, it's a nice font and
    you can see more of our TV branding work here if you're interested\r\n http://www.fontsmith.com/about/news/index.cfm"

    branding extended widely through BBC One; BBC News (national and regional) still
    relies heavily on Gill Sans, for example. \r\n\r\nJason, you have stated that
    the word \"one\" was the design impetus for the face, and that this is designed
    to be readily brand-identifiable; did the commissioners intimate whether they
    saw it replacing, say, Gill Sans as text <em>within</em> the News programmes,
    or other roles beyond the \"display\" role it currently occupies?"
