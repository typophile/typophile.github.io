body: "Hello. \r\n\r\nI need to alter the kerning in some otf fonts I use (e.g. I
  consider punctuation a part of the sentence rather than of the word, so I'd like
  the period detached from the letter please). Of course I can do that manually throughout
  entire books (hair space not always being exactly the right width for each individual
  case), or use an extensive list of grep-styles in InDesign, disadvantage of the
  latter being that it leaves InDesign inert to the point of freezing. Using a font
  design application on the other hand is not only illegal (minor issue), but damages
  the font or takes away some of its features (or so the glyphs' manual claims). Would
  any of you know a reasonable way to tackle this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot."

  body: It is not usual English typographic practice to detach the period, and some
    other marks, from the word, though it certainly is, especially for some marks,
    in some other languages, French, for example. Though it is true that there are
    plenty of letterpress English books from the past that do detach some marks. But,
    assuming usual current English practice, I do wonder whether you really need to
    do this . . . you may have a special reason . . .

  body: "Well, I won't detach it to a degree similar to that in French. However, I
    do believe there is some room between a full space and a dot that forms a unit
    with the preceding latter, as seems to be the fashion in our poor day. My reason
    is aesthetic, or if you will it's a semantic sensibility. A period must render
    a rhythm to phrases, it must phrase them like a pianist does playing the score.
    To that end, it must not only be visible (I find even the visibility impaired
    when the dot seems a diacritic to an n or so), it must also be in some accord
    with the rhythm of the words. This doesn't call for a full blank space, but it
    does call for some air. Or so I feel. Cf. eg. attached beautiful setting. \r\nBesides,
    while taking your assumption as a compliment, I usually work with german text.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0106_6541.JPG]"

  body: "You\u2019re right. I should have said that I hope a change equally achieved
    by perfectly legal means present in a typesetting application would turn out to
    be legal in most cases, which is what I hoped to indicate by calling it a minor
    issue. \r\nBut I realise instead of hoping, assuming and indicating I better had
    looked it up in advance and made explicit that I will restrict my interventions
    to what\u2019s permitted. (To pursue illegal intentions in a public forum signing
    with my real name would be a display of rather questionable wits indeed. And I
    assure you, not only am I willing to respect the license, I\u2019m actually without
    capacity to change letter shapes or the like to the better. So, simply, I won\u2019t.)\r\nTo
    the kerning matter: Now that I did a quick search, I find that e.g. Adobe\u2019s
    Garamonds are even \u201Clicensed for modification\u201D (cf. [[http://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-licensing/additional-license-rights.html|Additional
    License Rights]]). \r\nI apologise, and hope the offence isn\u2019t too great. "

  body: If this is Adobe Garamond, you can do the adjustments yourself, or pay Adobe
    or another type designer to do it. I would be happy to accomodate you. Drop me
    a mail if you need a quote.
