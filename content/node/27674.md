  emboss at all. I have found a lot of icons but all of them have too much details.
  What I need is simple icons for a toolbar. Does anyone know where can I get a library
  of icons?? I will pay for them. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\nSusancita25"

    can always make custom icons yourself. There's plenty of free software to download
    with which you can make your own icons. I use Graphic Converter to make icons
    from jpg- or gif-images. You can make 'em as simple as you want."
