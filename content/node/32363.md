body: "I'm typesetting my (philosophy) dissertation in Adobe Jenson, and I need to
  use a few lowercase Greek letters (probably only phi and psi). Could someone please
  recommend a typeface with Greek lowercase letters that will look good alongside
  Adobe Jenson? <!--break-->\r\n\r\nThe closest I have access to are Minion Pro and
  the free Garamond Premier Pro that came with my copy of InDesign. Here's what they
  look like alongside Adobe Jenson:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Greek
  Test_4211.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI used Greek phi's from Minion on the top line and from
  Garamond Premier on the bottom line. The second phi on each line is set in italics;
  I can't decide whether I prefer it that way.\r\n\r\nMinion's x-height is significantly
  larger than Jenson's, so I had to shrink the Minion phi's to 11.2 pt (against 12
  pt Jenson). That made them too thin, though, so I switched to the Caption optical
  size. For Garamond Premier, the first phi is just the Regular optical size at 12
  pt. The italic phi at the end of the line is from the Caption font, reduced to 11.4
  pt.\r\n\r\nWhich of these four phi's does everyone prefer? Any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nMatty"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions. Here's a new comparison picture.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Greek
    Test_4960.jpg]\r\nThe bottom line uses GFS Neohellenic 12.4 pt (against Jenson
    12 pt). The phi's were too small at 12 pt. I think I prefer both Minion and Garamond
    Premier. Any other thoughts or recommendations?\r\n\r\nMatty"

  body: "IMVHO, the Garamond works a touch better (although I do like the Minion):
    I'd make sure, as well, that in comparing A and \u03A6, as in your example, that
    if the A is italic, then the \u03A6 should be as well, even though I personally
    prefer the roman \u03A6 to the italic...."

    Test_4522.jpg]\r\nGentium, on the fourth line, is a bit to wide&#8212;a bit too
    open. (Thanks for pointing it out though; I'd never seen this lovely typeface
    before.) Arno, on the bottom line, is pretty much perfect&#8212;especially the
    italic at the end of the line. I think that is what I'm going to use. Thanks again
    for all the suggestions!"
