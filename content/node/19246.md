  body: "Hi,\r\nWhen I need to convert a font I use my old standby FontHopper. EULAs'
    aside, when a job is on my desk and Calfisch Script bold is needed I breakout
    Fonthopper and I convert. You may call me what you wish, but EULAs are an absurd
    reality. You can call me what you want, but really think about this, if Adobe
    can have a patent on a typeface (I'm thinking AGaramond here) that is not only
    from derivative work, but also quite like (think only a loupe could show us most
    any difference)  another font (think Berthold Garamond) then an EULA is not quite
    the Magna Carta, is it? \r\n\r\nWhen big type plagerizes, they put on the happy
    face of \"Adobe Original\" for Coronos.\r\n\r\nBig Type plays to the hype that
    when fonts (wrongly called software) are stolen that somehow the designers are
    going to die penniless. Guess what, if all of us paid for every font, somehow
    type designers would still die penniless. Long before postscript democracy of
    fonts was around Max Miedinger died penniless. His font was tied to one Big Type
    company. They sold it and sold it and we curse it as helvetica.  If ITC had the
    license he still would have died penniless. Did pirates make him die penniless?
    NO!\r\n\r\nBig type puts the squeeze on designers, smaller founderies and customers.
    Big Type stays big as long as they dominate the market. To the point now, where
    small type is really just a minor league for Big Type, they act much the same,
    but they don't quite have the libraries that do not have to follow fashion to
    keep food on the table.\r\n\r\nI do believe in order and am mostly a lawful type,
    but I hate it when issues regarding fonts have an unbalanced moral thermometer.
    You have a right to kick me for converting a font, but please scream to the mountain
    tops about big type too! \r\n\r\nThere is a good chance that if I'm booting \"Antique
    Olive Nord\" and I start making some bucks with it that at some point being a
    pirate will be too risky to my reputation or my clients reputation, that the font
    will be bought to cover this risk. I've yet to see Bitstream say something like
    \"our Swiss is really Helvetica and we should pay a royalty to Linotype.\" Believe
    you me they have made more money than you or I have in dealing with \"pirated\"
    material.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRodrigue Planck\r\n\r\nThe Truth shall set you

    it's ok for two foundries to make fonts from the same original typeface), so it
    doesn't suprise me that the glyphs are strikingly similar. however, a font is

    hinting, and other bits of info that make it different from the next. \r\n\r\nyou
    yourself would argue that Berthold's spacing is <em>superior to adobe</em> so

    hardware and data, which later the hardware processes according to the sequence
    of instructions defined by the software. As computational science becomes increasingly
    complex, the distinction between software and data becomes less precise. Data
    has generally been considered as either the output or input of executed software.
    However, data is not the only possible output or input. For example, (system)
    configuration information may also be considered input, although not necessarily
    considered data (and certainly not applications data). The output of a particular
    piece of executed software may be the input for another executed piece of software.
