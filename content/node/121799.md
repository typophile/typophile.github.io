body: "GRANDPANTS SANS\r\n\r\n \r\nGrandpants Sans is a font based on fundamental
  shapes we learn as children squares, triangles and squares. This new typeface has
  a tall x-height with some rounded corners to accent the typeface. Tall letterforms
  and x-height make the typeface legible and breaks it away from just another traditional
  sans serif typeface. With abstract ligatures the typeface will grab the attention
  of the designer and create big bold headlines to accent their projects.\r\n\r\nThe
  main purpose of GrandPants Sans is to used as display type. Font pairings will be
  necessary to give the typeface hierarchy. The typeface has interesting glyphs that
  would make the typeface distracting and not legible at small size. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SpecSheetonline_5001.gif]"

    for |J|\r\nI also wonder if there is a way to make alternate |T| different from
    |7|."
