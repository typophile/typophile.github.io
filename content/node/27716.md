  body: "I'm curious to know why you think this would be easy to ID? Don't you have
    any more letters? The 'a' and 'k' are about the only clues, really, and they are
    not very distinctive.\r\n\r\nFor me, this is not an easy thing to ID, as you have
    guessed from my reply. I am still looking though.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Me too - closest I've found is a few versions of Century but nothing this
    bold or slabby.

    Nr1 SH-Bold</a> (if you ignore the tail of the <cite>a</cite>).

  body: "Since this thread seems stalled, I decided to look for some alternatives
    at a little-known foundry I have liked for a long time called Unifonts. These
    are not identical, but they are pretty similar, and I think closer than the suggestions
    made so far. See <a href=\"http://www.unifonts.com/a_pages/andrewbold.htm\">Andrew
    Bold</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unifonts.com/v_pages/verenabold.htm\">Verena
    Bold</a>. This site is a great place for fonts that almost look like something
    familiar, but turn out to be unique and original after all. Victor de Castro has
    a strong calligraphic feeling to many of his fonts, but his independent foundry
    is off the beaten track, so to speak,\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
