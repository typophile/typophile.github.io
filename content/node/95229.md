  Bold Extended (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-be/bold-extended/)
  preferably with a light weight in the same family.\r\n\r\nSo far, I;ve found \"foundation
  sans\" http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/foundation-sans and Nimbus Sans
  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans/black-extra/preview.html  - These are
  close enough for this project.\r\n\r\nHowever, they both render badly in Firefox
  on seemingly all versions of windows. Does anyone have any tips or can suggest alternatives?\r\n\r\nMuch
  appreciated\r\n"

    Helvetica 73 Bold Extended]] through Monotype's web fonts service. However, the
    samples generated on their web site for Firefox (5/7) on different versions of
    Windows are not promising.

  body: Thanks Karl, I'll compare those. I'm actually thinking that this does render
    better than the others I've found. It might not be extended enough though. It
    needs to be very close to help convince the client to not use CUFON or something
    equally ancient.
