body: "Hello, I am new to Typophile. I am going to dive right on in and see if I can
  get some professional, honest feedback on a custom lettering mark I am working on
  for a logo. \r\n\r\nI want some good feedback on any and all typographic rules,
  spacing, weight consistancy etc. Just let me have it. \r\n\r\nI am at the point
  right now where I know its not perfect, but would like to receive feedback before
  I move forward. right now the a, e, and s bother me a bit.\r\n\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/franers_5566.jpg]"

  body: Looks kinds retro, but I would suggest to start looking at similar fonts for
    ideas on how to make the letters relate to each other more. Also the r connection
    looks a bit too contrived like something Ford would do. ;-)
