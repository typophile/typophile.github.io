body: "As I understand it, \"merged\" fonts were specially prepared Postscript fonts
  that allowed style buttons and keyboard shortcuts to change styles. Usually this
  is in Quark, but it might work in other applications as well. With current fonts,
  the style buttons make fake or styled versions of bold or italic. With a \"merged\"
  font, you could use Command+I and selected text would use the real italic, not just
  a tilted approximation. Most of what I know is from Robin William's book \"How to
  Boss Your Fonts Around\" from 1998. \r\nDo any Typophiles still use this feature?"

  body: Thanks for correcting my terminology.  It's interesting that InDesign is "Yes
    Yes Yes". This functionality seems to be important to some people. I tried a couple
    of OpenType fonts in Quark 6.5 and it seemed to apply a true italic for Command-I.
    Does Passport work differently?

  body: I can confirm that Quark 6.5 does use true italics with "Command-I" and OpenType
    fonts, if they are style linked. Same thing with Word (v. 10).

  body: Incidentally, the interesting thing about InDesign is that it's actually choosing
    the font via its font menu, not "applying" a style to a font. If you check the
    font menu, you can see for yourself that is has changed fonts. It has no generic
    "style" buttons or "style" menu choices. So the key commands are simply short
    cuts for selecting fonts. InDesign apparently looks at the style linkings built
    into the fonts to choose the appropriate family member. If there is no italic,
    command-I has no effect. If you choose an italic font from the font menu and do
    command-I you get the roman.

  body: "Cocoa apps (TextEdit, Pages, etc.) on OS X are less smart about style linking.
    They do something similar to what InDesign does, choosing fonts rather than applying
    styles, but seem to ignore the weight part of the style linking information. \r\n\r\nCommand-I
    toggles between roman and italic, but command-b has less desirable results. If
    there are only two weights, it will toggle between them, which is fine. In larger
    families, it seems to decide for itself which weight is \"regular\" and which
    weight is \"bold\", ignoring the intentions of the font designer. \"Regular is
    usually the \"regular\" or plain weight, while \"bold\" is whichever weight is
    next in weight after regular, regardless of the style linking. \r\n\r\nIf you
    repeatedly toggle command-b, you will soon be switching between these two fonts,
    regardless of which weight you started with. In the following examples, command-B
    should go between Regular and Bold, Light and Semibold, and Thin and Extrabold:\r\n\r\n\_\_\_Regular
    (command-B) --> Semibold (command-B) --> Regular\r\n\_\_\_Light (command-B) -->
    Semibold (command-B) --> Regular\r\n\_\_\_Thin (command-B) --> Semibold (command-B)
    --> Regular\r\n\_\_\_Semibold (command-B) --> Regular (command-B) --> Semibold\r\n\_\_\_Bold
    (command-B) --> Regular (command-B) --> Semibold\r\n\_\_\_Extrabold (command-B)
    --> Regular (command-B) --> Semibold\r\n\r\nAll this makes command-B rather useless
    with large families."

  body: So is it the case that some Type 1 fonts were style-linked and some were not?
    In particular, I'm referring to fonts that would have showed up in Quarks font
    menu as a single item, not separate faces.

  body: That's correct. One of the reasons some foundries skip style linking as a
    workaround to avoid cross-platform document issues with font names. If all you
    have is plain styles (regardless of what the fonts look like), it simplifies the
    problem. On the down side, you get much longer font menus.

  body: I'm not sure how you would do it with OS X and I don't think it's possible
    on Windows. With OS 9 and earlier, you could just open the font suitcase in the
    Finder and move bitmap or TT fonts in and out. With linked families, the FOND
    resource, which has all the link info, would follow the individual fonts around.
    If you spit up a family into separate suitcases, they would still find each other
    when they were active.

  body: "In Quark or Word, if Type 1 font is linked, then you can use the keyboard
    shortcuts, but you only see one menu item, which at this point in history can
    be confusing to some users. If your font is separated so that there is one face
    per font suitcase, then the user will see separate menu items not not be able
    to use keyboard shortcuts. InDesign is smart enough to apply the italic even if
    the suitcase is separated, but the bold doesn't seem to work reliably. \r\n\r\nI
    think one of the intended uses of the font smasher is to take apart \"frankenfonts\".
    That is, font suitcases that people have modified (usually in the past) under
    OS 9. As a lowly prepress person, I used to get fonts with names like \"Sans Serif\",
    which would be a Mac font suitcase containing Helvetica, Futura, GillSans, etc..."

  body: Style linking does not mean that the italic/bold/bolditalic styles will disappear
    from font menus. It is possible to modify FOND resources so that this also happens,
    but it's an optional step and not necessarily a good idea for the reasons you
    mention. It was a popular trick for a while around 1990, the idea being that you
    could clean up your font menus, but I don't think fonts are normally shipped this
    way.
