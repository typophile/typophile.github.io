body: what is the best version of helvetica neue? is it helvetica neue std? and if
  so, is there a point in purchasing it if i am restricted to quark 6 because it is
  an otf font? or for that matter is it even possible to use an otf font with quark
  6? <BR> <BR>&#40;btw, please refrain from any comments regarding the merits of helvetica,
  i&#39;m well aware of the discourse surrounding it.&#41;
