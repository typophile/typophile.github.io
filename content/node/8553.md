  of type forms in 3 dimensions.  This is not an original idea, but I was really interested
  in making a tool to experiment with the concept.  Here&#39;s the link : <BR> <BR><A

  <BR> <BR>need java 1.1, IE browser, non osX yet.... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a little bummed
  with 5&#42;5 type and am looking at alternatives.  Right now, thinking of fonts
  which mix squares and triangles &#40;like european train signs&#41;.  Any thoughts?
  <BR> <BR>thanks! <BR>zach'

    for alternatives to your 5x5 grid: what if each letter is a 2.5D shape? Like the
    &#34;O&#34; would be a pipe &#40;with some thickness&#41;. The math is of course
    much higher level &#40;not to mention the rendering&#41;, but you could make an
    online interactive version of the cool stuff in that little &#34;Dimensional Typography&#34;
    book - you know it? <BR> <BR>hhp '
