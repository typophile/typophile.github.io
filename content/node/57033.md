  sure that one existed, but I thought I'd take a look. I found the link below on
  a My Fonts *beta* site:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/ot-regular-italic/\r\n\r\nThe
  font is listed as \"Dinot\" but it didn't have any option to purchase - and I have
  been unable to find another link to it online. Any suggestions? Does this exist?\r\n\r\nConnal"

  body: "@ Ivo - that makes more sense. I know it's not uncommon for revision fonts
    to have some sort of clever reference to the original font, but if that's what
    \"DINOT\" was... I couldn't figure out what the heck it was referencing. I hadn't
    seen the microsite, but I have now. Awesome.\r\n\r\n@ canderson... i know, i know...
    :D\r\n\r\nit's being used as the interior for a reference book. I (and the publisher)
    love the look of it for body text and headlines (it's not a very dense book -
    very minimal and modern) but there are a few things that need to be emphasized
    with bold (easy) and a few things that need oblique/italics... heretical? perhaps
    functional? yes.\r\n\r\nC"
