  body: "I find it a bit strange that the top is all caps and then suddenly there's
    a capital in Sin. The capital S rather unbalances the bottom half. Also, in the
    Bello one, there's a lot more whitespace (blackspace?) around the \"S\" half of
    the cupcake, whereas the \"in\" half has a lot of concentrated white in one area,
    if you get my gist. Also, there's a slant on the sides of the cupcake bottom while
    the fonts are also slightly italic/slanted, but at a different angle, and it all
    just combines to make the bottom half look a bit messy. \r\n\r\nGiven the round
    and fluffy top section and the dark, somewhat jagged bottom section, have you
    thought about choosing a different font for the bottom that's also in caps, but
    maybe more jagged and pointy to contrast with the rounded font on the top?\r\n\r\nI
    understand the \"the bomb\" joke, but the fuse does seem a bit superfluous. But
    that might just be because I'd be expecting the bottom half to be round, like
    a cartoon bomb."

  body: "I think two typefaces is a good idea, but I don't think this kind of brush
    strokey font contrasts enough with the top one. I'd go for something in caps of
    a similar height and weight, but a completely different feel, a bit gothy or something
    with a center spur or something. Something a bit less soft. \r\n\r\nThat might
    be a bit too heaven/hell, but that cloudlike top half is kind of steering me that
    way. Please feel free to ignore me."

    is your name, use a lower case s, you may want to use a brush font with a bit
    more thick and thin to contrast the SWEET. Other than that it is pretty good...
    I could use a dynamite cupcake about now, even though I do not like sweets, just
    to wash down the bad taste of the other expert. :-)"

    They're not connected enough semiotically to tie them together. Unless you put
    a subtitle, as you said, \"Our cupcakes are the bomb!\"\r\n\r\nMaybe it's just

    I'm not personally offended by the bomb image, and if it's a reference to \"da
    bomb\", then there's no reason why you can't try that as a solution.\r\n\r\nI'm
    just suggesting that from a branding perspective, this might not be the best solution
    \ for a cupcake company. I'm thinking of the general rule that you want to associate
    your client's name with a positive experience. And (especially after recent events
    in NYC), people subconscious reaction to the image of a bomb might not be positive
    right now. "

    for a logo. It might be amusing, but only to the recently divorced, and they are
    exactly opposite the target market. '

  body: A funnier/more appropriate logo (to imply "sin") would be to have a bite taken
    out of the cupcake, to imply "original sin" from the Bible (Apple will sue! lol.)
    I actually like this idea a lot so I'm copyrighting it here and now!

  body: I think the bomb combined with the word sin just makes me think of getting
    fat and unhealthy. The colours are wrong, and the icing is too symmetrical and
    badly observed. Maybe have a bit dripping down. It needs to be a lot more sinful
    if that's what you're going for - how about the fuse ending in a devil's tail?

    the evil needs to be minimised to make this work \u2013 so, perhaps a piece of
    cake discreetly underlined with a pitchfork. Or try playing with the good/evil
    theme by splitting it down the middle? I like the 'bite' concept. Here's another
    idea: how about a stylised smile (to fit top typeface), messy with icing (having
    just finished a cupcake). Or simply shaping the type into a sweet smile?"
