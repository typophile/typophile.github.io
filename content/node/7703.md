body: Hi <BR> <BR>I was wondering if anyone knows the name of the pointing hand icon
  which appears in some fonts. I visited a museum in Italy last week, and I was surprised
  to see these pointing icons used in a book from the 16th century. <BR> <BR>Anyone
  know the history of this symbol? <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim

    By the way, does anyone know the history behind calling text hand? Is that where
    we get handwriting from? Come on, give me a hand. &#40;Ok, I&#39;ll stop.&#41;
