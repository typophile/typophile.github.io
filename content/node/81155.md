body: Does anyone know of a way to enable special initial capitals only when 'salt'
  is selected? This is for a font that uses the 'salt' feature to produce extra high
  ascenders as for the first line of text. I know that I can simply include the substitutions
  for the extra high initial capitals in the 'salt' block, and then use a downstream
  'calt' block to supress them whenever any of them might follow another upper case
  glyph, but that would require an enormous 'calt' block which I really want to avoid.
  If the OpenType formatt permitted an 'init' block to be subsumed inside a 'salt'
  block, this would be very easy, but unfortunately that is not permitted.

  body: Those names seem appropriate. The initial cap glyphs would just need to be
    grouped into a class, and the regular capitals in another class, in the same order.
    They can be defined like you showed using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#2.g.i">ranges</a>,
    presuming every capital has an initial form. If you have any additional initial
    forms such as accented capitals, they can be added individually inside the brackets
    after the range.

  body: "Scriptor, \r\n\r\nI don't quite follow what you mean by \"salt\" block or
    \"calt\" block. \r\n\r\nOpenType Layout works in the way that you define some
    lookups, and assign it to some features. Then, the OpenType Layout engine either
    applies some features automatically, or only upon user's discretion, to the entire
    text run, or (for some specific features) only in a particular context determined
    by the engine. \r\n\r\nFor example, \"init\" is only applied to the first glyph
    in a word. \"calt\" is applied to the entire text run, and is typically on by
    default. \"salt\" is applied to the entire text run as well, but is off by default.
    \r\n\r\nYou can assign the same lookup to multiple features, and the OpenType
    spec doesn't restrict you from performing any types of lookups within any features.
    You can use contextual substitutions in \"salt\", or non-contextual substitutions
    in \"calt\". You can use contextual or non-contextual substitutions in \"liga\"
    or \"smcp\" or whatever. Sure, it's not a good idea to confuse the font user by
    making features do something that the user doesn't expect. So a \"smcp\" feature
    that would substitute lowercase glyphs with variants that have long ascenders
    would be confusing \u2014 but there is nothing in the world to stop you from doing
    that. \r\n\r\nBut you're most certainly are not restricted from using contextual
    lookups in the \"salt\" or \"ss01\" features \u2014\_if that's what works well
    with your font. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Gargoyle, \r\n\r\nThe \"ranges\" functionality is useful, but not quite so
    useful. Sure, you can do [A-Z] and [A.init-Z.init], but in the real world, you'd
    naturally want to make \"initial\" versions of the glyphs for all uppercase glyphs
    (both basic English letters and the accented letters with diacritics). In that
    case, in order for the \"ranges\" to work, you need to make sure that the glyph
    order of the \"normal\" uppercase glyphs and the variants is identical in the
    font. Defining a normal class that just enumerates all the glyphs by their names
    is much safer, because you don't need to have the same glyph order in the font. "

  body: "From <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#2.g.i\">the
    spec</a>:\r\n<blockquote>For non-CID fonts, the ordering is independent of the
    ordering of glyphs in the font. &lt;firstGlyph&gt; and &lt;lastGlyph&gt; must
    be the same length and can differ...</blockquote>\r\nI took this to mean that
    that the order of the glyphs was not an issue, that ranges were expanded by simple
    incrementation of either the alphabetic name or a numeric suffix. Does this differ
    in FontLab 5, or am I misinterpreting the spec?"

    Latin or English, and that the ordinary size capitals (which are provided in virtually

    extra large initial capitals, an [A - Z] limit on the latter is not really any
    problem. \r\nI am thinking, though, that the extra large initial capitals might
    better be coded as a separate feature from the extra high ascenders.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/somedayn_6184.gif]\r\nThe
    above poem is done in cut and paste kalligraphy, but uses exactly the same extra
    high ascenders that the salt feature is intended to call up in the font."
