    sans serifs."

  body: 'I was going to say #12, but then I looked at it again and saw a logo that
    a public accounting company would use, it''s just to precise. But I can also see
    it working for a company that fits your description... it''s just a bit ambiguous
    in a sense that if I were to guess what the company does, I would''ve probably
    missed (and this is not a problem with, say, #1, #4 or #5).'

  body: "I'd say something like number one or number twelve, but I'm afraid I'd add
    to that that I think these are all a bit \u201Cweak\u201D\u2026 even after some
    kind of development. It's just a few letters, I think I'd go for something more
    unique (that is, not using a typeface but creating the characters or some kind
    of lettering from scratch).\r\n\r\nHowever, I do see these options as \u201Ccorrect\u201D,
    if I make myself clear. I mean, they do seem to match the description you made
    of what the company does, in some way. Marketing, copywriting, these are things
    that, to me, somehow call for something \u201Ctexty\u201D as a logo, as in just
    a plain typeface telling it as it is, so those two options I mentioned seem to
    work nicely (no letters touching, no symbols, just plain text, conservatively
    set as if typed). The name also helps. So if the company isn't heavily design-oriented
    but instead more about marketing, I could see why and how these kinds of options
    would be used.\r\n\r\nIn number twelve you might consider tweaking \u201Ccfa\u201D's
    size, because since it's bolder it looks a tiny bit smaller, as it stands right
    now."

    #8 to be more dynamic? It might work really nice. It would give this logo some

  body: "I like #2 the best. I like how the word bubble sits comfortably on the type
    more than the rounded #7.\r\n\r\nAlthough #8 solves the legibility issue of \"we
    are\" (although not that critical is it?), there's some things that bother me
    about it. For one, there's a weird tangent where the words \"we are\" is uncomfortably
    close the edge. Either have them aligned and more intentionally \"in\" the bubble
    or intentionally cropped. The tail of the \"a\" in \"cfa\" trailing off to the
    right on the outside of the bubble looks like a mistake to me. Should it have
    been cropped inside? I know this is still a work in progress, so sorry if it's
    nitpicky\r\n\r\nI know you're getting a lot of feedback. Just my 2 cents.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck! I know you'll be happy with whatever you end up with. Plenty of viable options
    there."

    little brain it does.\r\n\r\nAnyway, #7 is the best."
