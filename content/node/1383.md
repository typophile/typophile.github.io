  I&#39;ve never done this before, so I&#39;m anxious to hear your comments. The italics
  is killing me! <BR> <BR>Best, <BR> <BR>H

  body: 'Personally I find it a little bit too &#34;classic&#34; for my own tastes,
    but it certainly looks well-made, at least from that sample.  Anyway, if you could
    provide better sample it would be easier to spot problems. From that sample the
    only things I myself would suggest are: <BR>- The &#34;A&#34; is too tall. <BR>-
    The &#34;G&#34; needs work. <BR>- The &#34;Q&#34; needs a much braver tail. <BR>-
    The spacing is nice and tight. <BR>- The italics is great [for this genre of face].
    <BR> <BR>BTW, it reminds me a little bit of Vendetta, and Scala Serif too. <BR>

  body: "Botvide -- Can I ask you to post this sample in a different way? Can you
    enlarge the separate letters &#40;x2&#41;, shrink the sample setting &#40;x2&#41;
    and change the color to black? Just to &#34;see&#34; things a little more in the
    black and white. Oh and save it as a .GIF not .JPG  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif\"
    ALT=\":-&#41;\" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I really like the angularity of the italic.
    <BR> <BR>Quick thoughts: <BR>\u2022 The w looks pinched from both sides on the
    bottom. <BR>\u2022 The i seems taller than the normal x-height. <BR>\u2022 The
    g seems to be falling backward. <BR>\u2022 The v seems to be leaning forward.
    <BR>\u2022 Perhaps the G could become more Elzevirian. <BR>\u2022 The k seems
    a bit tall, the x-height portion of it.  <BR> <BR>And, I agree with Hrant&#39;s
    remarks. Accept, of course, the classic remark. I&#39;m all about the classic."

  body: Hi again! <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot for your comments. I think I agree with all
    of them. My problem is that I&#39;m getting stuck. Everything has gone quite smoothly
    until now, but now suddenly everything I do seem to make things worse. And not
    being a type professional I think I need to stop and take a deep breath. And sleep.
    Goddammit, I haven&#39;t slept for two days because of this! Is this how you type
    maniacs lead your life? The last thing you think of before you fall asleep is
    a possible curve of a lc &#34;c&#34;? <BR> <BR>Anyhow, here is a pdf, which perhaps
    makes it easier to look at the font. Please, feel free to send comments - I&#39;m
    listening. I just need to take a nap first! <BR> <BR>Best, <BR> <BR>H

  body: It looks like you&#39;re using overlapping letterform parts to make the letters...
    That makes it hard to appreciate what it will <i>eventually</i> look like. I assume
    at least some of the irregularity is intentional though, and that I feel is a
    good thing in this case. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Yes, <BR> <BR>you&#39;re right that I have done some overlapping, but only
    at certain, for me, especially tricky parts, and only to get &#34;forward&#34;,
    so I can move ahead, see what works, what does not, get the feel of at least some
    kind of holistic perspective. This is only a first rough draft, nothing more,
    just as I pointed out in the beginning. At this stage I am more interested in
    what creates a flow, not the individual letters &#40;which, naturally, is the
    key anyway - but these I can work on from scratch as soon as I know my direction&#41;.
    It is not as if it is the last check before it goes to the type store. I am not
    interested in copying someone&#39;s work, rest assure.  <BR> <BR>And Hrant, you&#39;re
    also right right about the irregularities. But some seem to disturb, others looks
    tempting to the eye. I just can&#39;t see any system in it. But you have to start
    somewhere, I guess. <BR> <BR>Best  <BR>H
