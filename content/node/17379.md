  body: "> <em>This font must exist\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nI've taken a little time to
    scan through <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com\" target=\"new\">MyFonts.com</a>
    but haven't come up with an exact match yet.\r\n\r\nYes, it may indeed be a font,
    but don't assume that it is a font for a PC or Mac. It may be an older proprietary
    font for a signmaking device like the Gerber SignMaker. You are showing us an
    outdoor sign to match, and an older looking one at that.\r\n\r\nThe sign industry
    has followed different standards for decades. Only in the last 10 years or so
    has some of the equipment frontends merged onto PCs. I'm sure you know this Nick,
    but I just wanted to remind some of the novice onlookers that NOT ALL FONTS were
    made for the same devices or equipment, and many adapted designs to suit the output
    device.\r\n\r\nEven if a sign is brand new, it depends on the equipment used (or
    manual adaptation if cut or painted by hand)."

  body: It does look very much like Modula Extrabold - artificially slanted- from
    the Solotype Catalog, David. I know of two digital versions of this. One is Modularity
    from <a href="http://fontsfordesign.com/index.html" target="_blank">Keystrokes</a>
    and the other is <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/j_p.htm"
    target="_blank">Kasse Ultra FLF</a> from the defunct Casady & Greene.

    Program' in one of the VGC catalogs I have, but not enough characters to find
    matches. Just a thought."
