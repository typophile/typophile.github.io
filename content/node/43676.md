  of the classic children's book, <em>How Tom Beat Captain Najork and His Hired Sportsmen</em>\u2014altogether
  a lovely production. I am restraining myself from including scans of the art by
  Quentin Blake.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks!\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3644.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5901.jpg]"

    available in OpenType, and I had a copy of my own, I might not keep admiring it
    in different contexts and wondering what it is! It's so unmistakably a Matthew
    Carter font, with those even, rolling italics (a lot like Yale's) and pseudo-old-style
    figures that are basically more beautiful than the real thing.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    sorry to blank out, there!"
