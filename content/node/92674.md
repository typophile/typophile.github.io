    could also try Crossfont:\r\nhttp://www.asy.com/scrcf.htm\r\n(Be aware that you
    cannot simply copy a Mac OS Classic font to Windows. The resource fork will get
    lost.)"

    is only for PC. \r\n\r\nAny other ideas?"

    More explanation here: http://www.asy.com/helpcf.htm#copymac\r\n\r\nThere's also
    FontXChange for Mac, which is an Intel app so should run on Lion: http://www.fontgear.net/fontxchange.html\r\n\r\nFontForge
    is certainly capable, though perhaps a bit less straightforward\u2014 you'll probably
    want to consult Google:\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=fontforge+convert+mac+pc"

  body: For any cross-environment migration or conversion, font-related or otherwise,
    I've always recommended doing the conversion on the TARGET system, if possible.
    The big advantage is that you can immediately test the result.
