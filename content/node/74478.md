body: Hey guys, first post here. I hope this is in the right forum. Anyway, I'm looking
  for font recommendations for a project, which is kinda of hard to explain. It's
  a bubbly type font that has an expressive blues feel to it. I know I've seen a cartoon
  where the character had a speech bubble slowly slur out of his mouth with the word
  "sigh." Perhaps the font you would imagine when you hear charlie brown's teacher's
  voice. I know I'm not giving much help here but oh well. Thanks for the input.
