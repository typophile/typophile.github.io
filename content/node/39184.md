body: "I'm really curious about this -- is there any way possible to access an opentype
  font's alternate 'a' or other characters (like swashes) using the Windows Character
  Map? I'm trying to see how far I can push using opentype with apps like Microsoft
  Word and CorelDraw. I can find small caps and such, but no luck on the alternate
  glyphs. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAddison"

  body: "Depends on the font. If the alternate characters have Unicode values, you
    may access them with the Windows/MacOS character map. Otherwise they are not accessible
    from outside the application. \r\n\r\n(In Corel apps you can only access the standard
    256 glyphs, or has this changed in the recent versions?)\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Looking in Font Explorer on the Mac, I don't see a Unicode value on the alternate
    characters, but I didn't see them on the small caps either (I can access those).
    The small caps were all under the \"Private Use Characters\" so I figured the
    alternates should be there, too. Font Explorer shows glyph IDs, but no Unicode
    values.\r\n\r\nCorelDraw supports Unicode as of version 12, but I still can't
    get to every character with their \"Insert Character\" palette. I'm curious about
    that, too."

  body: "Looking under \"Private Use Characters\" within Priva Pro, I find small caps,
    old style numerals, and small caps with accents (or whatever they're called).
    But if I look at the same within Bryant Pro, I get almost nothing. How are small
    caps and alternates stored within opentype fonts, or is that too much to go into?\r\n\r\nI'm
    on Windows Vista, by the way.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAddison"

  body: Wow -- when I check out Adobe Garamond Pro, I get everything. I guess it depends
    on where those characters are placed when the font is put together. I thought
    there was some sort of standard...

  body: If you don't see them under the Private Use Area or anywhere else, they are
    unencoded and only accessible via OpenType features. A developer can assign PUA
    codes, but there is no standard for them (by definition) so you may get a surprise
    if you change fonts. Even so, some developers do it to give users at least some
    access to non-standard characters with apps that lack full OT support.

  body: "Well, it really does me know good to understand this, but I'm curious. Looking
    at Adobe Garamond Pro with Font Explorer (on Mac), I see that the ffj ligature
    has a Glyph ID of 615, but no other value. On Vista within BabelMap it has a value
    of U+E088. Is there an easy way to explain what that means and why they're different?\r\n\r\nMark,
    that's why I'm glad you still provide a version of your fonts for non-opentype
    savvy apps. Thanks for the explanation."
