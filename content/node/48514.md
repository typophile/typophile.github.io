  one is the right one to use? Google returns the 1st one when searching for \"adobe
  glyph list\", but that seems the oldest! The last one, which confusingly is in the
  \"archives\", has a 2007 copyright but has the same version number as the fist,
  but the contents differs! Could Adobe remove the obsolete ones to prevent further
  confusion? \r\n\r\nThis really important for Romanian, because the U+016[23] are
  mapped to /[Tt]cedilla in the 1st list, but to /[Ttcommaaccent] in the other two.
  All TeX fonts pretty much use the first, while the Adobe fonts use and apps use
  the 2nd or 3rd. I'm inclined to email a bug report to the GUST foundry, which made
  most of the updated TeX fonts. But I need some authoritative source to back up my
  complaint.\r\n"

  body: "If you're *making fonts* you want the \"Unicode and Glyph Names\" document
    (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html) plus the AGLFN.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're a *consumer* of fonts (an application), you want to use the AGL.\r\n\r\nEither
    way, these docs are primarily about glyph names and Unicodes, rather than shapes.\r\n\r\nThe
    question of what to name the glyphs at U+016[23] and what shapes to use is particularly
    tricky, because of the history there; essentially, there was a mistake in Unicode
    in describing the characters as having cedillas. Because of stability guarantees
    in Unicode, the solution was to add new characters that are described as having
    comma accents (U+021[AB]).\r\n\r\nThe usage of these new codepoints by Windows
    and Mac OS has been pretty standardized for quite a few years now, so on those
    platforms the question of what to do with the old codepoints is of decreasing
    importance, mainly relating to old texts being imported or revised. I have no
    idea what the situation is with TeX and the various flavors of Unix, however.\r\n\r\nJohn
    Hudson, whose opinion most of us respect a great deal on font encoding and internationalization
    issues, has recently reverted to using the cedilla accent with U+016[23]: http://typophile.com/node/36473#comment-223302\r\n\r\nAt
    Adobe, we're not likely to change existing fonts, but we recently discussed what
    to do with new fonts moving forwards. One option is to put in default glyphs for
    U+016[23] which have the cedilla shape, but use the locale ('locl') feature to
    change them to comma shapes. Or we could follow John and Microsoft's argument
    and not bother with 'locl' and just leave the glyphs as cedillas. All TBD at this
    time.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    accent, and giving the S with cedilla glyphs the  <code>*cedilla</code> names
    and the T with cedilla glyphs <code>uniXXXX</code> names or <code>*cedilla</code>
    names. The notes that follow the glyph names are not the Unicode character names

  body: "Thank you both for the detailed replies. A couple more points will put this
    matter to rest:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The following two (AGL 2.0) files are thankfully
    identical except for the copyright notice:\r\nhttp://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/glyphlist.txt\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyphlist.txt\r\n</li>\r\n<li>The
    AGL 2.0 is a many-one mapping from names to code points, meaning that the same
    code point (sequence) can show up under multiple PostScript names. For instance
    U+0163 is mapped to both 'tcedilla' and 'tcommaaccent'. On the other hand, AGLFN
    1.3 is a one-one mapping, but it's not exactly a subset of AGL 2.0 -- it differs
    in the mapping of three glyphs 'Omega', 'mu', and 'Delta'. There's a comment in
    AGLFN 1.3 that documents this change. I grokked this stuff with a little script
    I wrote. Here's some output:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n$ ./groklist.py glyphlist.txt aglfn13.txt\r\nAnalysing
    glyphlist.txt:\r\n  Is the {(name, code)} relation right-unique? Yes. Is it left-unique?
    No.\r\n  Has non-unique names for 409 codes.\r\nAnalysing aglfn13.txt:\r\n  Is
    the {(name, code)} relation right-unique? Yes. Is it left-unique? Yes.\r\nIs glyphlist.txt
    a subset of aglfn13.txt? No.\r\n  There are 3449 tuples in glyphlist.txt that
    are not in aglfn13.txt.\r\nIs aglfn13.txt a subset of glyphlist.txt? No.\r\n  There
    are 3 tuples in aglfn13.txt that are not in glyphlist.txt.\r\n\r\n$ ./groklist.py
    -v glyphlist.txt | grep 0163\r\n    0163 -> ['tcedilla', 'tcommaaccent']\r\n\r\n$
    ./groklist.py -v glyphlist.txt aglfn13.txt | tail -4\r\n  There are 3 tuples in
    aglfn13.txt that are not in glyphlist.txt:\r\n  ('Omega', '03A9')\r\n  ('mu',
    '03BC')\r\n  ('Delta', '0394')\r\n</code>\r\nIf anybody is interested, I can upload
    it somewhere.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>The correspondence between Unicode code points and
    glyph shapes for Romanian has indeed been cleared up in 1999 when U+0218 -- U+210B
    range ([SsTt] with comma-below) was introduced in Unicode 3.0. That did not make
    the problem go away overnight though, but that's the topic of another thread.\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, this is the whole point. AGL maps all possible glyphnames that can
    be found in old and new fonts to Unicode codepoints, while AGLFN maps Unicode
    codepoint to preferred glyphnames (names that are not found in AGLFN should be
    formed using the algorithmic principles, i.e. using the uniXXXX or uXXXXX notation,
    or \"_\" for ligatures or \".\" for glyph alternates). \r\n\r\nHowever, in the
    most recent fonts Adobe made, they no longer use the \"*commaaccent\" and \"afii*\"
    glyphnames that are part of AGLFN. I have submitted a proposal to Adobe to revise
    the AGLFN so that it no longer lists \"*commaaccent\" and \"afii*\" names, which
    would be in sync with what Fontlab Ltd. is recommending. For those glyphs, you'd
    use the uniXXXX convention. \r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out the inconsistancy
    between AGL and AGLFN regarding \"Omega\", \"mu\", and \"Delta\". I'd argue that
    the updated AGLFN codepoints for those glyphnames should also be updated in AGL.
