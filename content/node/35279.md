    Here is one that comes close, Familian Son:\r\n\r\nhttp://com4t-fff.seesaa.net/article/16272147.html"

  body: "Sorry, I saw your favorite phrase was 'Dude' and I tried to work it into
    a sentence.\r\n; )\r\nAnyway, Freeware may be a weakness here. I have used a lot
    of freeware (it fits my non-profit budget nicely), and seen almost all the sites,
    but I suffer from CRS. But if I was looking for it, and the ID masters here were
    stumped, I think I'd start by going through the sans section at Dafont:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501"

    gotta concur with Dennis on this one. Not sansational IMHO."

  body: To clarify, the thing that makes me think it is freeware is the spacing/kerning
    is somewhat ill-considered. For starters look at the 'uic' and the 'ump'. And
    something else about the letters seems slightly askew to me. (Someone like hrant
    could probably tell me what is bothering me).

  body: "I went through my Sans Font ID Guide and there are very few fonts with a
    flat (stemless) a. Other than Skia which was already mentioned, there is a resemblance
    to Berthold <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/evo-bq/\">Evo</a>,
    but I am inclined to agree with the idea this is an amateur font.\r\n\r\n(edit:
    I should clarify that there are very few <em>non-square</em> sans fonts with a
    stemless a.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yes. This is most likely an amature font \u2013\_which is why I would like
    to find the source or inspiration. A client has used it and it's very problematic
    in spacing and what not. I am trying to replace it without much notice.\r\n\r\n
    All good. Dude."

  body: "Others have recommended Skia, and it has a much more professional look to
    it. It is a Mac font, but if you don't use Mac, you can get it at the link below.
    It was designed by Matthew Carter and someone named David Berlow, whose name rings
    a bell for some reason...oh yeah, he is one of the Typophile experts who can tell
    you more than you probably wanted to know about fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/MC10109\r\n\r\n>
    It reminds me of Existence although heavier.\r\n\r\nIf you check out the site
    of the author \"Yeah Noah\", you get a font editing program called Noah. \r\n\r\nhttp://mywebpage.netscape.com/yeahnoah/details.htm\r\n\r\nVery
    odd. I wouldn't be surprised if that isn't some other font (Skia?) that someone
    tweaked a little. But you're right, a faux bold of this would be very close, except
    maybe for the 'f'.\r\n\r\n"
