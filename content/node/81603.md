    it's a name of the company followed by some sort of \"Inc.\" or \"Corp.\" or \"LLC\"
    abbreviation.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the kerning - it seems OK, perhaps TA is
    a smudge too loose if I were to nitpick.\r\n\r\nLeading-wise I think the lines
    need to be spaced further apart. This is evident from the smaller scale shot,
    it looks somewhat cluttered. Also, I'd push the right edge of the second line
    a bit to the left, because right now 'u' appears to be sticking beyond L due to
    all that empty space in latter."

  body: "Thanks apankrat.\r\n\r\n.nl is the dutch equivalent to .com or .us whatever.
    That might clear somethings up. :-)\r\nI think  you are right on the TA. What
    do you think of the UR and NL? The might also seem a bit too loose to me.\r\nI
    agree with you on the leading. I wil increase it a bit. I will also deal with
    the optical illusion. I have the tendency to be too metric. :P\r\nRevision will
    be posted tonight.\r\n\r\nAnyone else got some feedback?"

    Went from Gotham to Proxima. Manually kerned.\r\n\r\nWhen the type treatment is
    ok I will design a visual element.\r\n\r\nFeedback very much appreciated! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_5620.jpg]"
