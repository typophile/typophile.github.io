  looking for a way to insert code (programme) into a type file (into a .otf or .ttf
  file).\r\nSome language I could use to write algorythm which could substitutes glyphs
  to others (based on complex rules, algorythmes)\r\n\r\nI can not use ligatures because
  the substitution rules are far too complex.\r\nIf I would like to define them one
  by one I'll have to do it for every words.\r\n\r\nWhich language (C, C++, Python...)
  ?\r\nWhich soft ?\r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\nPatrice"

  body: None of them. The closest things to programs in a font is the TrueType hinting/instructing
    code. Everything else is done with data tables compiled from a feature description
    language.

  body: "Anything more complicated than the glyph-to-glyph translations offered by
    OpenType is usually done in a text layout engine. Examples are: Uniscribe (Microsoft
    Windows), Core Text (Apple), Harfbuzz/Pango (open source), and LaTEX.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    software for special purposes such as equations (LaTEX again; MathType) and music
    (Guido) use additional routines, not linked to data available from font files
    only."

  body: You could write a program in the language of your choice to generate feature
    files (in AFDKO, VOLT or other syntax).
