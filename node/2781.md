  body: ups. sorry  <BR>It&#39;s about graphic design but it&#39;s open to larger
    public interested in urban culture. We try to make an experimental magazine &#40;strange
    papers and so on&#41;. <BR>It&#39;s name is NI CASO, a short phrase thats means
    &#34;don&#39;t pay attention to it&#34;

  body: Well . . . how about a proven face by famous Canadian type designer, Jim  Rimmer?
    Jim has cut many faces in hot metal for letterpress printing. One of the greatest
    living masters.  <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/JimRimmer.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/JimRimmer.html</a>

    <BR><a href="http://lanstontype.com/AlbertanInline.html" target="_blank">http://lanstontype.com/AlbertanInline.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>Rimmer&#39;s Albertan package comes with small caps, oldstyle and lining
    figures, and all the ligatures. <BR> <BR>Bookish, modern, yet traditional. The
    Inline gives the same pucker as eating Kefalograviera Metzovao Saganaki on a hot
    summer eve. Think about it? <BR> <BR>Shamelessly Zesty!

  body: For a magazine text. Albertan could be very nice. However, I think it needs
    a text weight. ;&#41; I tried it in a newsletter, but it seemed too sparkly at
    11 pt. ... &#40;Dreaming outloud for Gerald to hear&#41; ...  You updated it?
    Since I licensed it? ;&#41; <BR> <BR>What about Font Bureau&#39;s <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?fontname=Prensa"

    Which doesn&#39;t mean she shouldn&#39;t also ask us for the latter too!  :-&#41;

  body: '&#62;a font for the magazine name <BR> <BR>In that case, I really like your
    suggestion, as Panoptica looks very different and trendy - suitable for the purpose
    - but actually good. <BR> <BR>Another good option for a title is <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10747087233638044&amp;fontname=Amplitude"
    target="_blank">Amplitude</a>. The ultra all lowercase might look great, as the
    title is only 6 letters. It has &#39;edge&#39; and is very stylish. It is so bold
    you could also do an outline and stick pictures in it.   '

  body: Tiffany, <BR> <BR>If you mean sparkly as in light, Jim has digitized an even
    lighter version. There was a beautiful award winning Dutch Design magazine that
    used Albertan. It was printed on a light bees wing book paper. Truly beautiful.
    <BR> <BR>Sparkly can be a really good thing. <BR> <BR>When I  am completed with
    the project I will send everything along to you. The bold is in question, Jim
    has redrawn or refined the bold. I am not sure what Lanston&#39;s status will
    be with that? The naming will be more self explanatory throughout. We have dropped
    the Monotype operators codes. <BR> <BR>In otherwords, it will not be Albertan
    L, it will be Albertan Lining Figs. <BR> <BR>But I no longer have your e-mail
    address. We changed web hosters, naturally loosing many e-mails. If you drop me
    a note, I think the Metropolitan is finished. I could send it along. At least
    I will try before I move.  <BR> <BR> <BR>

    logotype. <BR> <BR>and this is totally off-topic but, I&#39;ve seen so many beautiful
    magazines start-up in the past year only to crash hard to lack of funding and
    or readership. Your going to need something &#42;very&#42; experimental about
    it, and a way better pitch - more then just different papers to corner any market
    in the design section.  <BR> <BR>tell us more.
