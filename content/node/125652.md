body: Does anyone know the legal implications of redrawing and potentially digitising
  elements of an old blackletter font found in a type specimen book? I have found
  an alphabet I would like to use elements of for a logo design.  The specimen is
  from an alphabet from 1579 in Lewis F. Day's book 'Alphabet's old and New' published
  in 1910 - the only details I can find about the alphabet is that it was Flemish
  and was taken from a rubbing of a memorial inscription.  But in general what are
  the rules about redrawing/digitising potentially out of copyright non digitised
  alphabets?  I am not looking to create a digital font file and sell it I just want
  to use elements of the font for a logo.  Any advice or feedback on this comment
  would be greatly received!
