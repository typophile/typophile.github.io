body: "So I was messing around in Illustrator today, and started going through some
  common fonts and writing down random phrases that I felt were in some way representative
  of each font\u2019s \u201Cpersonality\u201D. My subconscious was probably trying
  to weave the random phrases into a logical story, because they ended up loosely
  making sense. I thought it was kind of cool so I set each phrase in its respective
  font and took a screen shot to post. \r\n\r\nFeel free to add on and make a giant
  poem. Feel free to tell me that I should have better things to do. Feel free to
  say nothing. The only rule is that the phrase has to try to communicate something
  intangible about the font it wears.\r\n\r\nSorry about the bad kerning, I reached
  my limit for effort.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture4_4236.png]"
