  hand lettered, but could anyone provide any information about this? Is it based
  on an existing typeface? Has it been digitized? Images, anything... (sorry about
  the image quality)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DRESSING-ROOM_4865.jpg]"

  body: The Rs, Ss and Os are all different, so your initial assumption is doubtless
    correct. The lack of consistency in letterform treatment leads me to believe it's
    not based on any particular typeface, but rather lettering on a poster or ad of
    the period.
