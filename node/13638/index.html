The font I used is &lsquo;Century Gothic Regular&rsquo;</p>
<p>I know that a lot of work is ahead of me and I will appreciate your feedback.
-I&rsquo;ll also appreciate if you will let me know about logos that are resemble to this logo.</p>

<p>In reply to anticowboyism: No, my name is not sevex, its my nick.
for the removel of the &lsquo;er&rsquo; - you right, I&rsquo;ll fix that later on.</p>
<p>I decided to change the type completely and did somthing else.
I streached the type a lot, and the E&rsquo;s got kind of a Nine&rsquo;ish look, which I think turned out kind of uniqe.</p>
<p>The symbol also Changed. A circle frame was added and the connection to the &lsquo;X&rsquo; on the logo brought out more.
The &lsquo;V&rsquo; turned out like &lsquo;U&rsquo;, I tried to give her one cornery buttom but I think it ruined the whole image.</p>

<p>Check out a Sans with a slight curve to the end like Optima that might flow better with the X mark.</p>
<p>One last thing that stood out to me: Is your name Sevex? The tag line Freelance Graphic Designer leads me to believe that I need to speak with someone named Sevex. If that is not your intention, you may try a variant such as Freelance Graphic Design, without the er.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The non-rounded letters shouldn&rsquo;t exactly align with the rounded characters, reduce their height slightly, otherwise they burst out of the top (and bottom) of the logo. The top half of the E could be improved by increasing it, it looks as if it is leaning back, this will also address the kerning at EV. The V is definitely a problem since a potential viewer would not have any reference and would conclude it is a U I think you will have to abandon your skeleton and work with a more conventional form. Overall the construction has problems with an uneven colour especially dark at the centre of the X and Es and while EVEX are all monoline the S is light at the centre. The symbol is working best for me as per the left hand column.

<p>after awhile looking at it, I wasnt happy from the way my last logo was going. I wanted to preserve the circularity of the first concept, and to give him more of a younger look.
The color scheme also changed.</p>
<p>about the symbol - Im working on him right now. 
[I chose to include the letter &lsquo;X&rsquo; in the symbol mainly because of her weight on &lsquo;sevex&rsquo;. the &lsquo;x&rsquo; is also in association with unity, ways that cross each other,two lines that meets, and the &lsquo;x&rsquo; also draw more focus than the &rsquo;s'.]</p>

I am not too sure about that being very unique, or memorable, what about you.? This could be for everything.. You could have tried to, at least, slightly customize / modify the type.. But, I think you may want to return to sketching and scribbling various ideas on paper ( again ), instead of starting out with &lsquo;just&rsquo; setting type on screen..&rsquo; )</em></p>

I am wondering what you want a client to think Sevex is. That isn&rsquo;t clear to me yet. How do you want people to feel/think when they see your mark. I am a big fan of intentional design. So far I would assume your design is for a hair salon or a night club - or maybe some kind of sports food. It doesn&rsquo;t make me think illustrator too much yet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the &ldquo;Escher&rdquo; quality of the mark I prefer the gradient version without the stroke because that accentuates the three dimensional ribbon. The outline version looks rather light next to the type maybe just a case of increasing the weight (I say just but I suppose it would have implications on the stroke ends). You could also develop a black version of the mark with gradients. As Eben notes the apex of the V needs to be lowered a touch.

		<div class="commentbody">I think if you are going to reference 4 colour process in your logo you should include black as something more than a stroke. The stroke on D and E is weak compared to the type. C resembles a propeller to me rather than ink drops, maybe a highlight would make them seem more droplike. 
The stroke weight of your logotype is inconsistent, the centre bar of the S in particular is not working and the whole is a bit narrow, the X is too wide especially compared to the S, on the first E the final stroke could be extended to close up the space with the V and both Es seem to be lighter on the left.
As a final point the print and production is going to be expensive and the registration is going to be critical.

I don&rsquo;t really see a problem with the weight of the strokes in a printing context.
Also I like the mystery of the name I really don&rsquo;t see why the name, in this case, should mean anything as long as it is catchy and memorable; the X mark needn&rsquo;t have negative connotations as in vote cast, x marks the spot etc.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Eben - allthough you go through great lengths refining the design, which has it merits, the communicative value of the logo isn&rsquo;t up to par.</p>
<p>The icon tells me something about complexity and simplicity. This is good - making the complicated simple is a designer&rsquo;s core business. The friendly colours work as well; they warm up the hard lines.</p>
<p>The name and the type are something else, though. It might be my cultural background, but Sevex has a very harsh ring to me. It sounds latin to me, a word I would associate with a roman warrior or a very synthetic compound. The type doesn&rsquo;t soften this harshness - although it is somewhat rounded, the letters are too skinny to make this felt.</p>
<p>So if this were a choir, the different singers are very much out of tune.</p>
<p>In what you write I feel you are very attached to the name - for it&rsquo;s history as a nickname. But an Internetnick is very, very different from a graphic design business. I might sound a bit blunt, but I think a different name might make this a good logo in stead of a passable one.</p>
