  body: I have three Macs and this font isn't on any of them, so is it really a System
    font?

  body: "Nah, not \"Ouch\". \"Touch\xE9\" is more like it. ;^)\r\n\r\nYeah, I know
    -- that's the problem with speaking your mind on Typophile regarding your likes
    and dislikes of certain type designs. You're bound to run into the designers sooner
    or later and sometimes it's a totally unexpected person. :^P\r\n\r\nBut David
    knows I like (almost) all of his other designs, and he's always been a good sport
    in our previous \"run-ins\". I remember a hilarious response to a remark I made
    about how poorly Escrow was used in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=179\">the
    new De Standaard</a>."
