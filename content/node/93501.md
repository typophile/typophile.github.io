body: "I'm putting together an OpenType font with a lot of glyphs. Extended Latin,
  Small Caps, OS and Proportional Figures. I have the class kerning worked out to
  my satisfaction and my VFB file has 1,061 pairs. \r\n\r\nAfter I generate the OTF
  and open that back up in FL, the kerning pairs have ballooned to 22,445. And I see
  that several of my kerning classes have disappeared.\r\n\r\nIs this typical? I don't
  see anywhere in the options where I asked FL to expand or flatten the kerning.\r\n\r\nWhat
  is happening to my carefully organized classes?\r\n"

  body: "FontLab Studio 5.1 up to 5.1.2 build 4447 has a bug: it expands class kerning
    when opening an OpenType font. This problem has been fixed in build 4549: \r\nhttp://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio/fontlab-studio-5-1-2-pre-release-build-4549-for-mac-os-x/\r\n\r\nHowever,
    build 4549 has other problems of its own, so I'd recommend KEEPING your current
    FontLab Studio version installed (as described in step 2 of the installation instructions
    in the article linked above). Then, install build 4549, run it, open the OTF,
    save as VFB, and then continue working in your previously installed build. \r\n\r\n"
