  found myself sketching type all the time. I'd really like to find out how and where
  to learn type design properly. I've undertaken the task of designing a usable typeface.
  \r\n\r\nThe sample below was made from scratch and I tried not to look at other
  typefaces during the process. \r\nI would appreciate some guidance or direction
  on type design as I am very unexperienced!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_1_3624.jpg]"

  body: "Your basic design is solid, and pretty fresh for its category. The J particularly
    makes me happy.\r\n\r\nAll that remains, then, is to learn how to tweak your curves.
    There are a lot of visible bends where a curve meets a straight line. For example,
    look at the top of the P; you can tell exactly where the curve and the line meet.
    Check the joining node, and if the handles aren't lined up, straighten them out.
    If they are, but it still looks kind of pointy, then you'll want to use your eyes
    and make subtle changes to smooth it out. Pure geometry is often not in agreement
    with what you actually see. Study other fonts to see how they achieve this visual
    smoothness. If you're still working with one thick stroke, you'll need to convert
    it to outlines at some point so that you can adjust the inside and outside independently
    to really make it look right. You'll have to do that eventually anyway to make
    it into a font.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the top of your E accidentally got moved
    very slightly off level. In future, if you can get your stuff into a PDF to post,
    it will help you get better feedback here, because then people can examine the
    vectors more closely and be more sure of what they see."

  body: Thanks for your feedback. I'll put up a pdf. I wasn't sure if jpegs were ok.
    I'll expand the strokes to outlines for tweaking because at the moment it is even
    all over. In a typeface like this, do I still need to add contrast or will that
    throw off the geometric style I'm going for?

  body: "Contrast can still help something like this, as long as it is so minimal
    as to be imperceptible. Try making your pen proportions something like 97% high
    by 100% wide, more or less. If you get that proportion just right, it should look
    <em>more</em> even.\r\nBe sure to save your original strokes before you convert
    them to outlines; they may often come in handy later."

    Much appreciated.

    resembling an existing one. You'll learn a lot in the process anyway, like when
    you encounter a design problem and look at similar faces to find out how the designers
    solved this problem there.\r\n\r\nAnd besides in typedesign it's the small nuances
    that can make a big difference.\r\n\r\nJens"

    with the lowercase. I can always look at Chevin and steer away from the way its
    lowercase is designed in order to hopefully come out with a slightly more original
    typeface. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sorry Se\xE1n, I didn't mean to discourage you. Still, it's a good effort
    for a first typeface. As Jens says it's all part of the learning process, which
    is never a waste of time. That's the trouble with type design - producing something
    original requires as much thinking as actual drawing.\r\n\r\nNot looking at other
    typefaces while you're producing a design is a good idea. Looking at other typefaces
    then doing something different is also a good idea.\r\n\r\nKeep at it. It'll only
    take a lifetime, and you'll still be learning.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: "There is no rule that you have to release any typeface at all, and it's really
    quite a good idea to develop your first typeface(s) with the understanding that
    you never will release them. In 10 years time you will cringe when you see your
    earliest student work on packaging, movie titles, etc. and all the naive and inept
    flaws will stick out at you. Take this opportunity to learn from everything you
    see, including Nick's counter-example. Go hunting for all the typefaces that have
    these traits. see how they are different as well as similar. Look at your point
    structure and try to refine it. Be willing to redraw things to get a better shape.
    Set your typeface in 7 point and see if it works (being honest about that is one
    of the hardest lessons).\r\n\r\nHonestly I'm confused when you say you're sketching
    all the time, because this typeface looks completely made of straight lines and
    circle segments. Nothing about it looks handmade. It looks machine-routed. One
    thing about type is that even if things all look the same thickness, they probably
    aren't. Joins between rounds and straights, or several diagonals typically get
    thinner to avoid the clogs like you have in the bottom of G and middle of K. "
