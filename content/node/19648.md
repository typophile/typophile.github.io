body: "Heya all,\r\n\r\nI'de love all your criticism/advice on development of this
  logo.\r\n\r\n\"Eight Three Nine\" is a small DTP business that predominantly typesets
  display ads for Melbourne's \"The Age\" Newspaper.  At the minute, the website is
  horrible!  It looks like something from the dot com era.  It was set up over-night
  (as was the business, which was orignially 'something on the side').\r\n\r\nThe
  business is going well, and with a view to have it as my only income i'de like to
  overhaul the whole thing.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, i've kept it mono, colour to come
  later.  (colour will be really important in the end, but right now i'm looking at
  concept) \r\nText is Minion Bold Condensed (small caps).\r\n\r\nI'm trying to capture
  that 'old book' feel, you know, with the classic old text-faces and ornamentation
  etc.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that Minion is a good choice of face.  Maybe i need something
  a bit more rustic?  any suggestions?\r\n\r\nOrnaments 'can' look great, but I dont
  want it to be pretty or prissy.  Something is'nt right, it just looks a bit too
  nice/lovely/feminine(?).  Not really fitting for a business i dont think.\r\n\r\nNot
  sure exactly what direction to head next.  Stay with this concept, or perhaps a
  whole new direction?\r\n\r\nI could easily do the really clean website with the
  latest trendy typeface, but thats exactly what i'm trying to avoid.  I dont want
  to just copy the latest thing.  It would be great to see what i think is a good
  idea through to completion.  But right now i'm struggling!  Any help greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Cheers Jupiterboy - Pabst looks really good.  I think it will work well.
    \ Although it looks like i'll have to drop the small-caps, but thats okay, its
    probably a bit overdone anyway.  Pabst's lanky Caps and small x-height lower cases
    look really elegant.\r\n\r\nSome of the ornament style already comes from Lanston's
    Granjon Fleurons.  I like Lanston!\r\n\r\nI'm still a bit concerned its going
    to look a bit twee though.  might end up looking like a brass fitting on the outside
    of a Victorian cottage, which is not really what i'm looking for.\r\n\r\nThe rest
    of the design will become really important if this is to work.  At the moment,
    i'm thinking of the sort of style seen in old scientific journals, probably around
    the 40's and 50's in America.  \r\nMaybe i'd be better off cutting the ornaments
    down to just a few fleurons and using something bookier, maybe Lanston's Kennerley?
