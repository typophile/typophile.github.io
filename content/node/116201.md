    <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Letraset&ffam=Frankfurter%20LET%20-%20Plain&fid=7560ef426e58b8dd757d513a47a6353d&fsize=60&text=WATER%20TAXI&fit=1|Frankfurter]]</strong>
    and then manually filled and \"stencilized\".\r\n\r\n*Edit* I see that Ryuk found
    a proper match for \"WATER TAXI\" :)"
