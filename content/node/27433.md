  and Germany. Does anyone know good graphic design/typography bookshops in the the
  following cities : Brugge (B), Gent (B), Antwerpen (B), Rotterdam (NL), Aachen (D),
  K\xF6ln (D), Mainz (D), Frankfurt (D) ?\r\nTwo more infos : 1. I'm not looking for
  old/rare/collectible books ; 2. I've not mentioned Amsterdam, since I've already
  planned to pay a visit to the wonderful Nijhof & Lee Boekhandel.\r\nThank you very
  much."

    \r\n\r\nFrom the website:\r\n\r\nThe minotaurus bookshop started ten years ago
    as an outlet for \"drukkers in the marge\", the association of dutch private presses.\r\n\r\n\u2022Minotaurus
    Boekwinkel is a small bookshop in Amsterdam specializing in (mostly) new books
    about books. We sell books about bibliography, bookbinding, history of the book,
    typography, paper, marbling etc. We also have a small stock of Dutch and foreign
    private presses.\r\n\r\n\u2022The shop is located in the Sint Antoniesbreestraat
    3 D, in the oldest quarter of Amsterdam, only five minutes walk from the Central
    Station.\r\n\r\n"

    the old city is a design and architecture bookstore, too, but I can't recall the
    name at the moment.\r\n\r\nFrankfurt has a few bookstores that are nice as well.
    The first one that comes to mind is the one inside the Shirn museum. The store
    inside the St\xE4del museum is also interesting. \r\n\r\nI'll try to remember
    some more\u2026"
