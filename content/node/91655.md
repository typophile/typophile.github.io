  the results of a 22-year study into font choices used by political campaigns throughout
  the United States. Originally started by Monotype in 1990 in conjunction with the
  South Henrietta Institute of Technology, the exhaustive study analyzed the fonts
  used in more than 314,169 .U.S. municipal and state elections, with the goal of
  identifying fonts and typographic trends in the winning political campaigns. Visit
  Slideshare  presetation here: http://tinyurl.com/cjr3uxf\r\n\r\n\u201CWe were surprised
  not only by the wide choice of typographic styles used in campaigns across the country
  but also the clear advantage of certain fonts to help their candidates win elections,\u201D
  said Idee Claire, director of political graphic studies at the South Henrietta Institute
  of Technology. \u201CThis study debunks the myth that it\u2019s all about using
  red, white and blue colors \u2013 it\u2019s far more important to match the right
  font to the candidate\u2019s position they are seeking.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe study found
  these fonts resulted in a minimum 62.5 percent margin of victory when used in a
  campaign for the following offices:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rabenau_5215.png]\r\n\r\nMayoral
