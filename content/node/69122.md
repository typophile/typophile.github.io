body: I am quite hoping to identify the font from the 1961 poster for "The Frightened
  City." I am guessing the stencil variety was custom and is not available, however,
  I would be perfectly content knowing the basic font character set used here or any
  other information about these characters. I've been searching for a few years for
  this font, but with no luck. Proxima Nova condensed Black is somewhat close, but
  not exactly it. The Gs, Cs, and Rs are not right. Thanks much in advance!!

  body: It's close, but not quite the same. The Hs,Ts,Es and Is don't seem far off,
    but if you look at the C and G, the differences become more apparent. Thanks for
    the guess though! It's quite appreciated.

  body: "If you look at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-avant-garde-gothic/|Avant
    Garde Gothic Condensed]] in the heavier weights, it is pretty close, except the
    R would need a bit of work.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a faux-stencil, but in the
    60's such a thing may have been created from an existing Sans (of which there
    were literally hundreds of variations of weight, width, and design details).\r\n\r\n-
