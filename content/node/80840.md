    Garamond</a> is a digitization & expansion of the Garamond that Robert Hunter
    Middleton designed for Ludlow in 1929. Middleton based his design on the 1592
    Egenolff-Berner specimen.\r\n\r\nSo, I would classify FB Garamond under Garamont.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Trevor \u2014\_I think adding romans based on Granjon (handsome and deserving
    as they are) would be expanding the brief beyond what Thomas is attempting to
    do here, which is to divvy up the various romans typically called \u201CGaramond\u201Ds
    into those truly derived from Garamont\u2019s types and those derived from the
    Caract\xE8re de l\u2019Universit\xE9, which was originally mistakenly attributed
    to Garamont, but was in fact designed by Jannon.\r\n\r\nThomas \u2014 Both Garamond
    No. 4 and Garamond No. 5 seem to be digitized from the same source: Typoart Garamond,
    which looks to be derived from the Jannon lineage, not the Garamont.\r\n\r\nGaramond
    96 DT looks to be from the Garamont lineage. Whereas Garamond DT appears to be
    from the Jannon side of things.\r\n\r\nOriginal Garamond BT is based closely on
    Stempel Garamond and thus can claim to descend from Garamont.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d
    provided links to all your unclassified fonts, it would be easier to help you
    out."

  body: Kentlew, that's true, but I thought the purpose of this list was to help classify
    the myriad garaldes by their proper designer/influence.  If so, Granjon was the
    inspiration behind many seminal typefaces in this style.  Or maybe I'm just misunderstanding
    this thread. ;)

  body: "Trevor \u2014 I guess maybe the OP will have to clarify his intention. If
    the objective is really to sort all Garaldes, well, that is a much larger task.\r\n\r\nWith
    regard to italic styles, yes, many Garalde italics are based on Granjon\u2019s
    model(s). In terms of romans, however, I\u2019m not so certain that there are
    really all <em>that</em> many. \r\n\r\nFor one thing, Granjon didn\u2019t cut
    as many romans as he did other types. In the Plantin Folio Specimen c. 1585, for
    instance, I count that of the faces attributed to Granjon, 11 are italics, 9 are
    other (greek, b\xE2tarde, civilit\xE9, syriac, etc.), and only 5 are roman. \r\n\r\nThat
    was a quick count, so I could be off by one or two. And that one specimen is certainly
    not a thorough inventory of Granjon\u2019s work, but I would expect it to be more
    or less representative.\r\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019m just not thinking of all the ones
    you are. We could hijack the thread and count them up here anyway. ;-)\r\n\r\nI
