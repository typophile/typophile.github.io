    at the sun&#41; is about unemployed people, that&#39;s the reason of the title.
    Awesome movie, awesome Bardem, nice music. You must see it if you have the chance.

  body: Yes, I saw the movie &#40;I would&#39;t said that it is awesome if I hadn&#39;t
    see it&#41;, but Fernando... I just can&#39;t remember the opening titles, sorry,
    can you describe the typography a little, maybe so I&#39;ll remember... &#40;difficult
    thing&#41;. <BR>Anyway, I have a friend working in one of the production companies
    that made the movie, I&#39;ll call him tomorrow. I am almost sure he can find
    it out.

  body: Ok, thanks Ignacio. <BR>The font is a light sans serif, which letter &#34;a&#34;
    in lower case is similar to Meta but very light... <BR>thanks again!

  body: <a href="http://www.imagenline.es/" target=_top>Imagen Line</a> made the opening
    titles for the movie, but it seems that the designer that was in charge of the
    job is no longer working for them and they couldn&#39;t give any answer about
    the font. My friend now is trying other way , but meanwhile, curiosity killed
    the cat and I made these screenshots of the movie, could it be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/lucida-sans/"
    target=_top>Lucida Sans</a> ? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21596.jpg"
