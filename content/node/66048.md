    I haven't read the whole thing, but from what I remember it's a bit apologetic
    at least when it comes to his type design efforts, which would be a shame.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    my favorite quotes of his:\r\n- \"The poster is to art what rape is to love.\"\r\n-
    \"The quattrocento was the painter's century par excellence; our century is probably
    the sandwich man's.\"\r\n\r\n> he died the day you were born??\r\n\r\nIn fact
    potentially with an hour or two. What's extra spooky is that he was intent on
    reforming the Latin alphabet, as am I. An inconvenient difference however is that
    he was actually talented!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    quarter-length version in Spanish and English in issue #54 of Tipografica magazine:\r\nhttp://www.tipografica.com/54/?id=4\r\n\r\nThere
    is however a big caveat: Although the motivation and fundamental logic remain
    from that early effort, I have since realized something crucial that largely invalidates
    those results: letterform skeletons hold us away from optimal text face design;
    we must instead work \"liminally\" - designing the border between black and white.\r\n\r\nHanging:

    \r\n\r\nHey! It was awsome to read about you in that magazine! I used to buy it...
    I repeat: it is a very interesting and herculean work you've got there. I once
    read a book called \"Dise\xF1o.com\" by Nestor Sexe, I remember he mentioned the
    mutability and immutability of a sign. This is, as you said in the magazine's
    article, the letterforms do change but we will never notice maybe. The mutation
    of a form or the signification of a sign is a change that comes along with sociological
    changes (such as sumerian or egyptian script) or technological changes (such as
    the invention of the printing by Gutenberg).\r\n\r\nI think it's great that you
    lead and improve this changes to legibility and easy writing. I did an investigation
    on the characteristics of the typefaces and the aesthetics movements of the time
    they were created. It was very interesting to see how the form of the writing
    keeps changing according to the culture, art, technologies, and even religion.\r\n\r\nI
    would love to keep talking and learning about this, but I think we went off the
    topic of this thread... "

    Hi Nick,\r\n>>\r\n>> I'm writing a short article for Saturday's paper on the link
    between\r\n>> typefaces and personality types -- based on Pentagram's What Type

    John Allemang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Hi John,\r\n>\r\n> Pentagram has picked up on the
    \"social research app\" meme and larded it\r\n> with video and edutainment to
    create a viral promotion.\r\n>\r\n> There was a \"What font are you\" quiz on
    Facebook early last year which may\r\n> have given Pentagram the idea:\r\n> http://www.quibblo.com/quiz/87AyPEY/What-Font-Are-You\r\n>

    Or this:\r\n> http://blog.extensis.com/typecaster/\r\n> &c. &c.\r\n>\r\n> Trite
    amusement.\r\n>\r\n> **\r\n>\r\n> I don't believe in government by opinion poll.\r\n>
    I don't believe in product development by market research.\r\n> I don't believe
    in examination by multiple choice.\r\n> I don't believe in categorizing people,
    therefore I don't believe in\r\n> personality types. Only behaviour.\r\n> I believe
    in creating typefaces that resist categorization.\r\n>\r\n> A font is a tool that
    may be used to create many effects. The blackletter\r\n> style, for instance,
    is good for ecclesiastical work, alternatively hip\r\n> hop and heavy metal tattoos.\r\n>
    Fonts are like actors. Some can play many different parts, others always\r\n>
    play themselves.\r\n> Fonts are like musical instruments. Some, like the french
    horn, have\r\n> little range. Others, like the piano, huge.\r\n> Fonts are only
    superficially like anything else.\r\n>\r\n> If graphology is a pseudoscience,
    how much less meaningful that makes the\r\n> correspondence between typeface and
    personality type.\r\n>\r\n> Best Regards,\r\n>\r\n> Nick Shinn\r\n\r\n\r\n> I'm
    assuming the responses in the typophile link below are all deeply\r\n> tongue
    in cheek -- you're playing this game, however cleverly, just to\r\n> mock the
    stupidity of it?\r\n\r\n- John\r\n\r\n\r\nThat thread wasn't a multiple-choice
    \"what (personality/font) type are\r\nyou\" game.\r\nIt was more about physical
    appearance than personality.\r\n\r\nHumour, certainly, but not mockery. It was
    an invitation by David\r\nGoldstein to banter about which fonts one might find
    sexually attractive,\r\nif one caricatured oneself as a typeface.\r\n\r\nI suggested
    that I was the auto-erotic Thesis, a typeface with both serif\r\nand sans serif
    varieties--riffing on the previous poster's mention of Gill\r\nSans' attraction
    to Perpetua, which is to all intents and purposes \"Gill\r\nSerif\", both designed
    by the sexually notorious Eric Gill.\r\n\r\nWhen Andy Clymer said, \"I'm Akzidenz
    Grotesk, only more optimistic,\" well,\r\nthat wasn't about anything other than
    the horrific name of that particular\r\ntypeface.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think that
    thread addressed the issue of whether personality\r\ntype/typeface correspondence
    is stupid or not. There are no doubt other\r\nTypophile threads which do, but
    searching Typophile archives is difficult.\r\n\r\n_Nick\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI would
    imagine that Mr Allemang's article was also edited, and that a third party wrote
    the headline and deck.\r\n\r\nAlthough I think this stuff is trivial and the topic
    worthy of more than \"a few minutes to share your thoughts\", I feel obliged to
    participate from a business perspective, to keep myself in the public eye and
    on the usual suspects list when it comes to type design commissions. So I am slightly
    peeved that after spending quite a few minutes corresponding with Mr Allemang,
    I was mentioned as a \"designer\", not a type designer, and that the word \"designing\"
    was removed from my statement \"I believe in designing typefaces that defy categorization\",
    without, even, the substitution of an ellipsis."
