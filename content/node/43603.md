  typefaces). They bought it in 2000/2001. The disc contains TT and PS files and seems
  to work fine on all machines. We also have a ITC-officina sans/serif bought separately.\r\n\r\nOne
  minor problem is that the  ITC library does not contain any Euro-symbols.\r\n\r\nNow
  we have a unique offer to buy the Adobe Type Collection with a 1500 euro discount.
  \r\nMy question: should we buy the Adobe Type Collection?\r\n"

  body: Sounds like a good deal. It certainly wouldn't hurt to have some quality OpenType
    fonts and add some new faces to your current library.

  body: I purchased the Adobe OpenType Collection a couple of years ago. Even though
    I got a $1000 discount, as a designer, I'd prefer to buy select type families
    from various foundries, though I don't regret the versatility and classics that
    the collection provides. If your company deals with common typefaces with your
    clients, I'd recommend the purchase.

    monotype, etc. come with OSF (beside Tabular Numbers) and SC.

  body: "Poms, the OT fonts from Linotype in the Adobe Collection should be the same
    as (or really close to) the versions you'd get directly from Linotype. But the
    OT fonts from ITC and Monotype are not the same. If you buy them from Adobe, you
    get fonts with less features than if you buy them from ITC or Monotype. If you
    want Monotype or ITC OT fonts with features, etc., you need to go to one of their
    sites (ITCfonts.com, Fonts.com, Faces.co.uk, Linotype.com, etc\u2026)."

    the fonts.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if I read you correctly, Adobe aren't criminals.
    Anyone paying attention and doing a little research would realize their fonts
    do not have the OsF or small caps included. "

  body: "In a word, NO! As discussed on other threads, the Adobe OpenType collection
    contains a surprising number of text families that offer no more glyphs than their
    old type-one PS versions. This means, especially, there are no oldstyle figures
    where you would most expect/want them. \r\n\r\nAfter being razzed here for implying
    that all their new OTs now had full glyphs, Adobe made the bare minimal qualification
    in their sales copy for the OT collection: now \"many\" but not all families have
    full glyphs. You have the burden of researching 2,300 fonts! So, it pays to shop
    around and not spend such a bundle in one place. \r\n\r\nIf, for example, you
    like Galliard but want to use oldstyle figures with all its fonts, you must acquire
    the new ITC OT version, which gives you all that, instead of the Adobe OT version,
    which does not. Or Plantin, which comes with full glyphs only in the Monotype
    OT version, not the Adobe. When buying from Adobe, favor the families Adobe originated,
    like Arno, Warnock, Minion, etc. For these, their own children, Adobe made all
    the right moves. It's easy to get screwed buying the wrong version...caveat emptor!"

  body: "Haven't they always just been called STD (standard) ? I've always understood
    that those fonts, STD, weren't enhanced OT but only fonts re-packaged in an OT
    wrapper. \r\n\r\nYou are right and I was suggesting that they need to be researched.
    But, if someone is making an investment like that I'd assume (yes, yes I know
    what happens) that they'd want to research exactly what it is they are licensing."

  body: If you spot-check Adobe STD packages, you'll find that some have and some
    do not have more glyphs. With oldstyle figures, it mainly depends on whether Adobe
    offered expert sets in the old type-one PS version (that's where OSFs were parked);
    those would usually get folded into the OpenType version but the result would
    still be labelled STD as distinct from "Pro" which indicated more bells and whistles,
    like optical weights. So the purchaser must still research Adobe's glyph coverage
    symbols before he buys. I also like to e-mail customer service and get an unambiguous
    answer, because if the fonts lack what they promised, you can claim a refund...otherwise,
    goom-bye!!

  body: "In Adobe's fonts, the Standard vs Pro nomenclature is about language coverage,
    not typographic features. For example, Kepler, which has a boatload of typographic
    goodies, is a \"Standard\" family.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm a little confused by this
    reference to \"the Adobe Type Collection\" and \"the Adobe OpenType Collection\"
    and people then talking about Adobe's info/PR for same.\r\n\r\n<strong>Adobe</strong>
    has a product called Font Folio (or Adobe Font Folio), which has lots of OpenType
    fonts. The latest version is Font Folio 11, replacing the older Font Folio OpenType
    Edition (a.k.a. Font Folio 10).\r\n\r\n<strong>Monotype</strong> has created a
    product called \"the Adobe Type Collection, OpenType edition,\" which has lots
    of Adobe fonts which they are authorized to resell. Adobe did not create and does
    not sell this bundle of fonts, and is certainly not responsible for disseminating
    info about it.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks for all the responses. I have to deside within two
    days and I found out that the Adobe Font Folio 11 costs less then the Adobe Type
    Collection It also looks like the Folio 11 contains the same fonts, perhaps even
    more. Also the ITC library we already had, turns out to be outdated.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    The Adobe Open Type Collection will cost me 3200 euros (10 licenses) \r\n\u2022
    Folio 11 cost 5500 euros (also 10 licenses). \r\n\r\nWhat are the major differences
    between the two pakkage (except the huge amount of money)?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n"

  body: I'm also considering recommending purchasing Font Folio 11 for our clearing/Publishing
    house. One of the strongest reasons in its favour, in my opinion, is that Adobe
    seem to make embedding really uncomplicated in terms of the EULA. Thomas Phinney
    has claimed elsewhere that Adobe don't require any additional licensing fee for
    use of a font for an ebook or PDF publication. This will make a big difference
    to us. I hope I haven't misunderstood.

  body: "That is correct. Adobe's licensing does not charge anything extra for \"commercial
    PDF\" usage or the like. All the fonts that are entirely Adobe-owned are even
    set for \"editable\" embedding. The license even allows for user modifications,
    which hardly anybody else does any more (it used to be more common).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
