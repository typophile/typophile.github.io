  to see? <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to head up to the American Papermaking Museum in Atlanta,
  but I won&#39;t be able to.  bah.

  body: I&#39;ve always enjoyed walking down the Riverfront with a plastic cup of
    beer. Mostly because it&#39;s fun to drink in public with impunity. The Riverfront
    also used to have great breakdancing. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been
    there though. <BR> <BR>Valdosta, Georgia has the best all-you-can-eat fried catfish
    and hushpuppy dinner known to man. Unfortunately it&#39;s about 3 hours from Savannah.

  body: Thanks Brian, might check it out. <BR> <BR>Nathan, supposedly we are going
    to the Riverfront, though I don&#39;t drink alcohol so that part won&#39;t be
    for me, heh.  No Valdosta either, just Savannah this time.

  body: You know, the Riverfront can be pretty fun. There&#39;s a lot of crappy tourist-style
    souvenir stands, but there are also some pretty good reaturants &amp; shops &amp;
    such. Plus, having reloacted to the landlocked Midwest, the stink of ocean air
    makes me swoon. <BR> <BR>When I was wee, my parents used to drag me around to
    all the quasi-historical re-enactment stuff. Savannah has some of that, too -
    perhaps there&#39;s an old-timey letterpress shop somewhere.

  body: I&#39;d love to go see a letter press shop. <BR> <BR>I know we&#39;re probably
    going on a ghost tour or two. <BR> <BR>And most likely we will be eating at the
    riverfront at least once. <BR> <BR>Just over 24 hours and counting until we leave.

  body: Enjoy the South, Chris. No matter what you end up doing in Savannah, you&#39;ll
    have fun. It&#39;s actually one of my favorite cities down that way.

    now.
