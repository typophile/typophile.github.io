		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, looky here - it is Uli, our great Latin speaker and self-proclaimed legal expert :-) So now your a font technology expert, too? I&rsquo;m impressed.</p>
<p>So, this font is not crap. Let me ask a few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you know about font technology? (We are talking about the SOFTWARE here, you do realize, I hope? We are NOT, I repeat, NOT talking about the design, we are NOT talking about the typeface, which is great.)</li>
<li>How many fonts have you actually done yourself?</li>
<li>What is the status of your education concerning font programming?</li>
<li>On what do you base your assumption that these fonts are okay? (and please do not say that letters come up when you press keys, please, please, please&hellip;)</li>
<li>What do you know about the structure of Truetype fonts?</li>
<li>What do you know about unicode tables?</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh, and one more thing - &ldquo;But then, for Pike Werfer, most things are crap and abysmal.&rdquo; Please prove this by naming examples. As far as I know, we have not met, and I daresay I never tagged anything as crap before in this forum. I do believe the word abysmal popped up in our last conversation, though. However, &ldquo;ULI&rdquo; is not the equivalent of &ldquo;most things.&rdquo; :-)</p>
<p>Otherwise, I would be forced to categorize this as a stupid and untrue attempt to insult me, proclaim things about me which are untrue and simply act the troll. Which means I will once more stop taking you serious, laugh about you, and invoke &ldquo;The Silence Brigade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please allow me to be so bold as to state my opinion: you know next to nothing about font software programming. Sorry to say it.</p>
<p>This, however, is a conversation where people who DO know talk about how to improve a font which is not so good in order to honour the wonderful design which it visualises. Oh, and no shady lobbyists here. No money involved. Just enthusiastic type people. Sorry to disappoint you.</p>
<p>Should I be correct, and should you not be able to answer the questions (as you did the last time we had an argument, which was quite embarrassing for you, I daresay), then I would politely ask you to stay out of it. Okay? It is simply rude to interrupt people who have a conversation by spouting unproved insults. It is a nono, Uli. Your mother should have taught you that.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way - just to inform you, since I believe you are trying to get your fun out of annoying people (this is indeed an assumption, I have no proof of it :-), let me tell you that you do not annoy me. You entertain me. Therefore, stay with me and keep posting stuff like this - don&rsquo;t go away like last time. I do adore having arguments with people like you :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@fontplayer - thank you so much. I&rsquo;m really thankful!! Let&rsquo;s hope he answers back. Since I would never touch a font without the consent of the person who made it. Golden Rule :-)</p>
<p>@Miss Tiffany - sorry, but I guess I&rsquo;ve got no choice. I didn&rsquo;t start this, but since he asks for it, I&rsquo;ll gladly let &lsquo;em have it. :-)</p>
<p>@Uli - Hey Uli, since you are once again unable to answer a single question - could it be that you can&rsquo;t read? I do hope you&rsquo;re not blind :-)</p>
<p>Well, your answer proves my point. You don&rsquo;t know anything about fonts, do you? But you like to be important, and prove it by posting links you found in google. So very clever of you. Why this community, I once again ask myself. Why not motorcycles?</p>
<p>So, what would it help you if I told you that some of the table entries in the font are wrong? What would you say when I tell you that this font needs contextual features to really work? Would you understand when I tell you that the scaling is not always correct? What would you say if I pointed out that the hinting in some places could be improved?</p>
<p>I remember some guy named Uli telling me that he could prove his point, but that I should check for myself, hihi&hellip;. Do you want me to post the link of the topic where you said it? I could, you know :-) Oh, it is a bad thing when your own words come back to haunt you, is it not? Was it not you who claimed things without being able to prove them? (Want the link :-) And now you&rsquo;re blaming me for not doing it. Oh, you would be such a bad politician. Don&rsquo;t you realize everybody can see through it, and is laughing about you (well, apart from the people who get aggravated by you - luckily, I&rsquo;m not one of them)?</p>
<p>I did not prove them, because I simply wanted to talk to people who are able to get me into contact with the designer, so that I can talk to him, or get the permission to do a new version. So I am talking to people like fontplayer. This topic was not about dissing the typeface. It was not about dissing the designer. I thought it unnecessary to prove anything, because it was not my intention to attack anyone. Read the initial question. So there was nothing negative in this topic until you dropped in. Do you feel good now? Oh, and do you WANT me to prove them? If so, I might sit down and make a list. Just for you. To shut you up properly. Come on, ask me :-)</p>
<p>In case you want to learn something about fonts - and we are still talking about the SOFTWARE - then feel free to get a book. Oh, and the term &ldquo;crap&rdquo; simply states my opinion. Nothing else.</p>
<p>Oh, just to make you happy - I have ALL versions of Scriptina here, and the links you posted were known to me - I have access to google, too, you know.</p>
<p>Oh: &lsquo;The Dafont and Desktoppub font files have been tampered with by persons like Mr. Werfer who want “to improve the font quality”.&rsquo; So you think you have enough knowledge to state that</p>
<p>a. I tamper with fonts without the consent of the creator (why this thread, then?)
b. claim that I am not good enough to do it properly
c. you yourself have enough know-how to know when a font has been improved or not</p>
<p>Uli, go away. Please. This is hilarious. Claiming without proof - did you not, just a few lines ago, state that this is a bad thing? Come on, make up your mind. Or is it like: other people need to prove it, I, the great Uli, do not need to. You claim that &ldquo;people like me&rdquo; manipulate software without the consent of the creator. You are accusing me of a crime, you do realize that? Without proof, of course. :-)) You should be thankful I do not know any shady lawyers, hihi&hellip; Oh, what fun. Every forum should have someone like you. Well, need to get to work now. See you soon, Mr. Stiehl. Naw, let&rsquo;s drop the Mister, eh, shouldn&rsquo;t we, Uli? Doesn&rsquo;t sound good :-)</p>

<p>I wish there were other authors of computer programming books at Typophile, so that the false claim &ldquo;Fonts are software&rdquo; made by font sellers in order to deceive gullible font buyers could be discussed by experts instead of by laymen who have never written any books about computer programming.</p>

I don&rsquo;t care if you don&rsquo;t like to call fonts software - I do. But if it makes you happy, you could also call it script file, or executable (if its PS), or data. But what do you know about it? In other words: DO YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT A FONT REALLY IS? Oh, and what about those other questions? Don&rsquo;t you go and start picking raisins here! :-)</p>
<p>So you wrote some software. Great. But I don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s beside the point. I was talking to somebody about fonts, and you come barging in. Oh, and comparing yourself will old Billyboy is not really a good one.</p>
<p>So you wish there were other authors of computer programming books here, but there are none? Why don&rsquo;t you then go and look some place else? Leave people alone who do not want to talk to you, hmmm?</p>
<p>And no, I have NEVER written a book about computer programming. I&rsquo;ve been to busy doing it for the last 20 years. :-) And the last 10 years were mostly concerned with fonts.</p>
<p>Tell ya what:</p>
<p>You claim that, for me, most things are crap and abysmal - prove it!
You claim that I am one of those people tampering with fonts - prove it!
Oh yes, and how about proving that blind people cannot read :-))</p>
<p>If you do so, I will give you a lecture about fonts as such and Scriptina in particular. I promise!!</p>
<p>Otherwise - Silence Brigade for you once more :-) You do amuse me, but I do have things to do.</p>

<p>Sorry, but you are really a lunatic. ;-) Here I was, talking to a fellow typophile about a topic you do not fully grasp. You come barging in to annoy us, claiming stuff you cannot prove and which you probably even know to be wrong.</p>
<p>Then, when I point out your inconsistent and rather unintelligent behaviour, you start ranting about my name in order to discredit my valid arguments as well as myself as a person, and to camouflage your insulting behaviour. I have got news for you: it won&rsquo;t work. People on this forum are much too clever.</p>
<p>Go and look for me if ya like - come to Hamburg, I will give you a sightseeing tour. :-) And until then, stay out of the conversations of grown-up people. fontplayer and I are talking to each other. Oh, and by the way, you DO know that Pike is a male name, don&rsquo;t you? I am married with children :-)) Oh, and one more thing:</p>
<p><em>whisper</em>
I am NOT listed in the phonebook. I don&rsquo;t like it. My initial idea was to protect myself from annoying calls from people who want to sell something to me while I am preparing dinner; looks like it has other advantages, too :-)
<em>end of whisper</em></p>
<p>and now for the last secret:
<em>whisper again</em>
Werfer is not a real person - he is actually a little elf with pointy ears, taken from my favourite comic, Elfquest. Pike is the English version of his name, so I thought it would be a cool pseudonym. I&rsquo;ve used it since I don&rsquo;t know when. But thanks for checking the Hamburg telephone book. Now I at least know that there is no one living here who is REALLY called like that :-) Did you really, honestly believe that all these people here don&rsquo;t use nicknames? Ye flipping gargoyles, this is the internet. Did you check the Seattle telephone book for fontplayer? Is there a Miss Tiffany in New York? What about hrant? God, don&rsquo;t you at least feel a little bit stupid now?

		<div class="commentbody">I don&rsquo;t have an overall idea for a storyline &amp; I can&rsquo;t be bothered to think about one now just yet, sorry. I&rsquo;m been swamped in a lot of personal projects lately &amp; with every single thing I do, I get 3 new ideas. Workwise it&rsquo;s hell, but I just get such a great rush from these &ldquo;creative sprees&rdquo;. I can&rsquo;t sleep, I forget to eat, I drink &amp; smoke an awfull lot, but I feel fantastic! Mind you, I might have some ADHD symptons ;-p The idea of working together on a story really appeals to me though. My first font ever included a whole bunch of cute dingbats (<a href="http://typophile.com/node/27678">http://typophile.com/node/27678</a>) &amp; since I have a lot of sketches to make an extended family of it, I was thinking of &ldquo;promoting/showcasing&rdquo; it in a little comic book or illustrated storybook. So far, I&rsquo;ve only got one limerick (<a href="http://typophile.com/node/31766)">http://typophile.com/node/31766)</a>, but if you can think of a nice story that includes zombies, squirrels, batman, monkeys, spiderman, strawberries, the smurfs, hamburgers &amp; fries, Mickey Mouse, butterflies &amp; Mario Bros, it might be nice to work together ;-)</div>
