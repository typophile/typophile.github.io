  body: '&#34;Keyholes don&#39;t look like that anymore.&#34; <BR> <BR>True, but we
    all know that is a keyhole. And plenty of great older homes still have that trademark
    keyhole. <BR> <BR>#1 is too literal. <BR> <BR>#2 has potential. I agree with Soren.
    If not remove the bottom stroke, perhaps just shorten it to give it the &#39;hint&#39;
    of a bottom strok. <BR> <BR>#3 I like for some reason. The keyhole is obviously
    horizontal, which doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense, but I do like the form. <BR>
    <BR>But perhaps the concept of an actual &#39;key&#39; is maybe just too literal.
    To be fair, &#39;TurnKey&#39; is a pretty generic name to begin with, so you don&#39;t
    have a lot to work with.'

    you used a face that was a little less vertical, but left the keyhole-R, as is,
    then the attention given to the keyhole-R might overcome any other subtle associations

  body: I am not really into the R being a key hole. The shape doesn&#39;t really
    lend itself to maximum legibility. It feels like you are forcing an insignifigant
    relationship between the R and a keyhole. I am not getting a reward out of this
    logo &#34;yet&#34;.  I was under the assumtion that the website was rewarding
    it&#39;s users if they were to &#34;Turn the Key&#34;, turning the key I assume
    is a metaphor for the unlimited access to the real estate market the website provides.
    Write know the logo feels &#34;locked&#34;. Hope that makes since!

    Optima, it is called Zapf Humanist, but when comparing the two they are identical

  body: '&#34;the logo needs to communicate that with TurnKey, creating a website
    is easy and simple&#34; <BR> <BR>Sally, I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve
    achieved the goal you set for yourself. The logos you&#39;ve created thus far
    say &#39;real estate&#39; but more in the sense of a real estate agency, not a
    service for realitors. Is Turnkey a software program? A template to download?
    How will the logo be used? on packaging? on-line? The fonts you&#39;ve been using
    give the design a delicate look. Appropriate for an agency that specializes in
    million &#43; estates, but is it appropriate for this client and their product?
    If simple is the main concept you wish to communicate I think the logo is still
    too complex. The two-tone key hole is distracting and personally I don&#39;t think
    the shadow 3-d effect adds anything to your icon, and I do like the key hole.
    I know you are planning on wrapping this up soon. I&#39;m sorry if this sounds
    negative - it&#39;s not meant to be. Your designs look nice, and are leaning towards
    quite elegant. It&#39;s just that from your own description it seems like they
    aren&#39;t hitting the mark yet.'
