  modernist period, as they are particularly beautiful and abstract solutions for
  visualizing seemingly complicated philosophical, psychological, sociological, and
  business-related concepts. \r\nLooking at the credits, I came across an amazing
  one by the designer Harold Pattek. I looked further into this designer and it seems
  as if he has shared some exhibitions with designers such as Muller-Brockmann, Aicher,
  Neuburg, etc. Also, I found two of his works in the AIGA design archives. But, aside

  else. Does anyone know anything about him?\r\n\r\nw j f"
