<div class=commentbody>I think both Plantin and New Century Schoolbook have versions with infant a's and g's. A slab-serif I think would be nice for kids. How about italics? Have you considered using italics? Many typefaces have single-storey g's for their italics. I'm just thinking, PMN Caecilia italic might be good. Sassoon Primary is an italic sanserif type for teaching handwriting. If you don't want to use italics, ITC Officina Serif has a single-storey g. For Officina Serif, the g is essentially the same as the Sans counterpart, so there won't be a problem. What's wrong with showing kids a double-storey g anyway? I don't think they'd get confused at all.</div>

<div class=commentbody>About the single-storey "g", maybe Seagull? Keith suggested slab typefaces, and in fact, almost all of them (Lubalin, Beton, Egyptian 505, etc) have single-storey "g"s. <br> <br>About the "P", I think I never saw a connecting one. I'm currently developing a typeface for a primary school teacher; it's a typeface for teaching children to write. In the reference book she showed to me, the "P" is the only non-connected character. <br> <br>About teaching with sans/ living with serifs, I think it will just bring us to another legibility/readability discussion. I don't think it's a contradiction, I think it's natural.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Here are the Ps and gs for Bembo, New Century Schoolbook and Plantin. The Univers g is the type I am looking for. These are all Adobe versions. Do other versions exist with different lowercase Gs? <br> Italics would give me the g I'm looking for but I really need the normal roman style. (It's funny seeing that sans serif Gs change to double in the italic and serif Gs change to single in italics.) I also noticed that egyptian/slab serifs have the g. Initially I passed the idea up because I wanted something to contrast well with a sans serif . But you've made me think about it some more. What if I just used all slab? <br> I've shown an example with Chaparral MM. Even though I lose style contrast, I could just keep the point sizes far enough apart. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/12285.gif alt="Univers, Bembo, New Cent, Plantin, Chappy MM"> <br> <br>Seagull has a great g, but I need a more "classic" look rather that playful. It is for children, but I need more 'normal' letterforms. Something more playful could be fun though. Hmm.. <br> <br>Thanks for the input so far, it's been helpful! <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Ah, the Monotype schoolbook versions are great. I'll try the Bembo version since its P connects. The 'a' was another letter that concerned me but I had given up on that one. It's good to see that these schoolbook versions also have the 'basic' a. <br> I've been comparing the gs again for the last few minutes, and I have absolutely no idea what made me think that "sans serif Gs change to double in the italic" and even, for that matter, that "serif Gs change to single". I don't have the type book in front of me right now that I was using at the time of my earlier post so I can't go back just yet and look again to see what made me think that. It was probably just that I was comparing a ton of both serif and sans serif fonts in both their roman and italic forms all at once, and doing it quickly at that. <br>I just went looking with ATM for an example of either case of the g switching forms, and couldn't find one, so I must've just been going cross-eyed. <br>Hopefully I didn't cause you to lose too much sleep wondering what in the world I was talking about. <br>Again, thanks for the help. Too bad my mistakes are going to get archived, huh? <br>=) <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> serif Gs change to single <br> <br>That one's actually pretty common. <br> <br>BTW, another place you can find "kiddie" a/g glyphs (that don't slant) is in so-called "upright italics", which are however very rare (and they generally still incline, although by a minute amount). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>To me, single-storey a's and g's in 'traditional' seriffed type look a bit strange, especially for revivals like Bembo. They are just not compatible with these early designs. The double-storey a and g are more of a humanist roman thing, where things were written slowly and carefully; the single-storey ones, on the other hand, came from the italic hand which were written a bit faster, without lifting the pen so much. I guess that's what distinguishes written and printed forms. I wonder if showing traditional seriffed faces like Bembo to kids with single-storey (schoolbook) forms might confuse them? I don't know...</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's Monday, and I have my type book back now. I wasn't completely going crazy.. perhaps only partially.. <br>Here are serif faces that switch from double to single story g when going from roman to italic: <br>Bernhard Modern <br>Christiana <br>ITC Clearface <br>Corona <br>ITC Cushing <br>(but still no examples, as HHP wrote, for sans serifs) <br>There's probably more, but at the moment I don't have time to check them all. (Notice those are B-C.) <br>KT, good points. For example, "ea" is a common letter formation, and the two together are a bit forced. I'm not sure it would confuse them, but it does look awkward.</div>
