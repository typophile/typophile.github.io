  going to come through for me either, so this must be harder than it looks...\r\n
  \r\nLet's set good taste aside for a moment, and ask what's the headline font -
  the flowing script with the (cough) crystal treatment used for the headlines on
  http://www.releasethelather.co.uk/\r\n\r\n(the site, by the way, is TOTALLY safe
  for work, despite the possibly questionable url!)\r\n\r\nThe unusual cap 'a', the
  nonstandard dot over the 'i'... surely they'll give the game away to the connaisseur!\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance."

    version of the same font), however I notice that the sample on the site home page
    uses an 'r' that is not in either version. The L is also customized.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, that font does show up on <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg3.html\"

    -  of course - I should have *known* I'd overlooked it in the SFIDG :-)\r\n\r\nThanks,
    again - and for the incredible speed!"
