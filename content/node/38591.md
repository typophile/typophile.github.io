    rules might prevent a Canadian from working there, unless you have a grandparent
    from there. (Not sure if the Common market has changed things ... perhaps a grandparent
    from any other ECC country will do.)\r\n\r\nOthers may know better."

  body: "Hi Fantomas \r\n\r\nAny luck yet, we live in UK and Spain moving between
    the 2. We wanted to move to the States or Canada but for us it is very hard to
    move there due to all the red tape.. I would think it would be easier for you
    coming to the UK as as a whole the UK is a soft state country, let us know how
    you get on.\r\n\r\nRegards BS"
