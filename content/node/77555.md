  body: I and S look heavy compared to the rest. And the visual play is either too
    subtle or not subtle enough.

  body: The space between the L and A bothers me a little. You might try tightening
    the kerning there (or even overlapping) and adding a bit more space between the
    other characters.

  body: "If you are trying to achieve an effect of accentuating the negative space
    (around the OLPR), you may want to increase the weight of all the characters in
    the logotype. This will then allow for the figure-ground relationship to be better
    represented. There are many logos out there that illustrate this well, as I am
    sure you are aware, however only a few of them work really well. Take a look here
    to get a better idea on [[http://www.gr8lessons.com/EP/figureground.html|figure-ground
    theory]].\r\n\r\nThis is a great word-mark by the way, I love how it incorporates
    the idea of a star/poles into the letterforms! Great job."

  body: "@Riccaro0 - agree with the letters I,S. Can you explain the second part of
    your sentence please? I'm kind of confused about the sign being too/not subtle
    at the same time.\r\n\r\n@James - I tried to make the space between the letters
    according to the space between O&L and L&R (the star..). I'll try to see if it
    still looks ok when I ignore this consistency tempt? \r\n\r\n@Wesley - Thanks
    for the useful link. Question: if I increase the weight of all the characters
    - won't I end up with the same relations between the figure and the ground? I
    played a little bit with it, and couldn't see the difference. Any other tips on
    how i can accent the negative space?\r\n\r\nThanks guys. \r\n\r\nElsi\r\n\r\n"

  body: "> I tried to make the space between the \r\n> letters ...[consistent]\r\n\r\nJust
    to be clear, I was referring to the space which I've highlighted below in red,
    which is much larger than the space between any of the other letters. To me it
    almost looks like 2 words \u2014 POL and ARIS\r\n\r\nOf course it's unavoidable
    to some extent when you put those 2 letters together, but I'm just suggesting
    that you compensate a bit more.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spacing_5913.jpg]"

    flat-topped A.\r\nMaybe the arms of the starshine should be equal in thickness
    (at least the ones opposite each other--OL and PR)?"

    some -fast- solutions.(Eliason - did you mean to numbers 3,4?)\r\nTo me, each
    solution gives a different 'funny' space. \r\nMy thought is that I should keep
    the name Polaris as simple as possible without adding small changes that might
    draw the attention. This way, there will be a clear seperation between the two
    elements: letters and sign. \r\nI think number 5 or 7 (original) might do this
    work well. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Polaris03_4093.jpg]"

  body: "LamaKova, another approach to even out the spacing might be to add more space
    everywhere except between LA.\r\n\r\nBelow is just a quickie example; I didn't
    try to fine-tune the spacing exactly, but you can see  how the LA gap is less
    noticeable.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spaced_3819.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnother
    approach would be to use upper & lower case instead of all caps, although I guess
    you'd lose that star-shaped negative space between lines if you did that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    two R's were different before reading the replies; it just looked like there was
    a diamond, and it was like, ... huh?\r\n\r\nAlso, tightening the L-A kerning presents
    a dilemma: either the two words won't be centered anymore, or the OLPR star will
    have to go."

    it?\r\nDoes it feel like the P of Polaris is left out if taking it in relations
    to the word Press? (notice the relation of the letter S in the two words..)\r\n\r\nI
    did some changes. I assume there are hard to be noticed. I like the second version
