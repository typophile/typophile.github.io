body: i would like to improve upon my typesetting skills. I have never really come
  across any specific "drills" per say that aid one in understanding letterspacing
  properly, but I was curious if anyone has any suggestions. Overall, I can do it
  rather well, but I do struggle with some aspects spacing.

    to her book, <em>Thinking with Type</em>, that has plenty of good examples and
    comparisons of different settings to look at: the subjects covered under "Text"
    are kerning, tracking, line spacing, and alignment. They are not drills, but still
    a useful resource.'

  body: "Here's what I learned from the great John Langdon about kerning:\r\n1. Visually
    center each letter between its surrounding two letters.\r\n2. Make sure recurring
    negative spaces are spaced exactly the same.\r\nFor example in the word \"miniature\",
    the mi should have the same kerning as the ni, since the negative space between
    those pairs are identical."

    A note of warning, take  the "correct" answers with a grain of salt, some of them
    are WRONG. None the less it's a cool and interactive way to improve your kernin'

  body: There is a nifty online interactive kerning exercise and I'm sure it was mentioned
    on Typophile at some point. Stick around - someone has the link.

  body: "<em>Exercises</em> become more productive when you do them routinely in life.
    Refining your typographic skills and awareness is just like learning to play the
    piano (or other instrument)... if you don't practice, you simply will not get
    any better!\r\n\r\nLuckily, kerning is less difficult a skill to refine than learning
    to fine tune the color of text. Yes, learning to visually balance kern pairs in
    lines of copy goes hand-in-hand with text color, since imbalances in inter-letter
    spacing disrupts eveness of color.\r\n\r\nBut even when all the kerning is \"correct\"
    (visually balanced), the color of text blocks can still be off or can be improved.
    This is a skill more difficult to refine let alone be aware of.\r\n\r\nFor a while
    I have been reviewing graphic design and typography curriculum for assignments
    and exercises to improve type color awareness, and I haven't seen many at all.
    If anyone is aware of such useful programs, I would greatly appreciate hearing
    about them.\r\n\r\nSince I don't believe graphic design students take much time
    scrutinizing, proofing and adjusting typesetting output (high-res hardcopy), I
    don't feel they can develop a higher awareness of text color and the subtleties
    of texture, flow and weighting.\r\n\r\nI think I have come up with a short and
    simple series of exercises/assignments (three sequential activities that I hope
    to present at TypeCon) that would help bring text/type color sensitivities to
    students. I think they will definitely learn about color, but getting better at
    any skill is a matter of sustained practice."
