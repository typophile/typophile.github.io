  body: The font is a custom one developed by Disney Artists. You used to be able
    to download the font according to <a href="http://www.mouseplanet.com/sue/sk010607.htm"
    target="_blank">this article</a>, but the link didn&#39;t work any more. I suspect
    it&#39;s still around somewhere on the Disney site.

    that the font they were talking about is the one used for the movie title though,
    because there was also an Atlantean language and alphabet developed for the movie.
    It may be the font was the new <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/atlantean.htm"
    target="_blank">imagined alphabet</a> of the Atlanteans.  <BR> <BR>Something to
    amuse your friends with, I suppose. Sounds like the guy who invented Klingon,
    was the  one who came up with Atlantean for the film.

  body: Oops! I guess that first post worked after all. The Server is acting up again,
    because I got a message that my first attempt didn&#39;t make it, so I added more
    and re-posted.  I hope that&#39;s not too confusing.  <BR> <BR>I see Matt probably
    had the same problem.

    the same look.
