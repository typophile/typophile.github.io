body: This is the cover of a Field Guide book. What typeface is used for the "Tasmanian
  Produce" ? The top looks like Helvetica to me.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tas_book_hero_3750.gif]

  body: Reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-alias/harbour|Harbour]]. Still
    haven't able to spot a match at the moment but keep in mind it could be bespoke.
    Still searching...

  body: "Four leads:\r\n1. \"Harbour is a clash of Latin and Germanic typestyles\"
    might give some hint as to where to look further \"Roman Gothic\" \"Roman Blackletter\"
    etc. Also unusual features such as lazy S counter in _O_.\r\nA quick check at
    my fonts yields zip with these terms. \r\n\r\n2. This is a new book so it is probably
    a font, either bespoke for The Field Guide or from a less known font maker, perhaps
    Australian\r\nMore of the font at http://fieldinstitute.co/blog/the-field-guide-to-tasmanian-produce/\r\n\r\n3.
    Unicase as shown in this sample from the website [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TasmanianUnknown_4031.jpg]\r\n\r\n4.

  body: Unfortunately, nothing came up, a complete dead end. Your last chance may
    probably be to directly ask 'The Field Guide' and if they answer, drop the answer
    here.

  body: Looks very much like something from Gareth Hauge/Alias. Noah is also in the
    same vein.

  body: You're very right, Frode. Alias Type Gareth Hague with Harbour was apparently
    a decent lead but [[http://www.fontshop.com/families/noah-alias|Noah]] is definitely
    closer, your sample typeface being some sort of 'Noah Unicase' or 'Noah Display'
    and exclusive for 'The Field Guide'.

    seems to be.\r\nNoah is a mix of Harbour -- link already posted -- and Asperity
