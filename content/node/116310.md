  body: "That's fantastic thank you Ryuk. \"Demonized\" is spot on.\r\n \r\nI would
    like to buy the Helvetica Neue Font but it's expensive so I would prefer to buy
    it in a weight that I could use for other projects. Do you have any idea which
    would be a good beginners/all rounders weight that I could probably push to the
    weight on the tyre using illustrator without it looking too strange (I'm new to
    this)?\r\n\r\nThank you"

    which I believe are also considered by many as the most iconic and well designed
    styles of Helvetica Neue.\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica-neue|Adobe
    version]] is cheaper too. You could also have a look to Helvetica clones: URW++
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans|Nimbus Sans]], Paratype [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/pragmatica|Pragmatica]],
    Scangraphic [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/europa-grotesk-no-2-sh|Europa
    Grotesk]], Bitstream [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/swiss-721|Swiss
    721]]\r\nAnd finally, if you couldn't afford any of them, you could fall to the
    lure of the Dark Side of the Force and go with Arial (Bold or Black) which comes
    free with Windows, mainly reworking terminals and making them horizontal. "

  body: "Hi Ryuk, \r\n\r\nThanks so much for the help, I wouldn't have even known
    where to begin to start looking! I bought the Helvetica Neue Bold so I'm sure
    that will get some use in the future. As for the Champiro font I didn't fancy
    buying one as I doubt I will use it much and will probably be just as hard to
    manipulate as a free one. Am going with Vandiana as hopefully that will get me
    most of the way :-)"
