body: "Hi everyone my name is Neil, Graphic designer in Australia. I have been reading
  the forum for a while and it is nice to meet you all\r\n\r\nI am doing some research
  for a design blog. \"Oh not another one!\" you say. Well it won't be, it will not
  be covering the same rehashed crap that is on a lot of design blogs at the moment.
  I can't stress this enough.\r\n\r\nI would like to find out what YOU would like
  to read on a design blog. What would benefit you?\r\n\r\nHere are some of my ideas
  so far . . .\r\n\r\n    * Interviews with real world designers\r\n    * Reviews
  on hardware from a designer's perspective\r\n    * Reviews on games/software from
  a designer's perspective\r\n    * Design Process of my work and others\r\n    *
  In-depth articles with good examples\r\n    * A source for upcoming design events/conferences
  around the world\r\n    * Humour added into articles, e.g. funny captions, comics\r\n
  \   * Design related tutorials e.g. getting a design job to software (video, audio,
  article)\r\n    * Writing about a topic from a different angle (if beneficial)\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  want quality over quantity, articles that will truly benefit the design community.\r\nLet
  me know what you like, what you don't like and any other ideas you were hoping to
  read.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: not at all, try it out. Blogs are a great source for inspiration and education.
    What design material do you like to read?

  body: "> I don\u2019t read blogs\r\n\r\nI was going to say 'me too\", until I realized
    that I do. But only blogs from people I really respect. I read T. Phinney's, for
    example. I would read a Nick Shinn blog, if there was one."

  body: 'Unless you have a specific focus, or an authoritative voice, your blog is
    going to suck. There are more than enough boring new design blogs, I assume most
    of the started with a very similar list. You should target one of the empty design
    corners of the internet echo chamber and focus on that. '

    can help uncover a niche.

    have opened my eyes to how specific you mean.\r\nI was thinking of a blog that
    focuses on the design process of designers?"
