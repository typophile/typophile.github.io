  in Toronto, Canada, and I'm trying to start up a typeface foundry at our school
  called Xheight. \r\n\r\nThe foundry will promote, nurture and distribute student
  typeface design through the web. There's also a printed annual component. \r\n\r\nPlease
  help my research out by doing the survey at www.xheight.org ! Suggestions are much
  appreciated as well :D Thanks! "

    project. I wish such a foundry would have been available when I was a student
    in college. What kinds of material are you going to put out if it gets off the
    ground? '

  body: "The main content  will be typefaces that students have designed for the school's
    type design courses, other design courses and on their own time. As the site grows,
    other content may include visual typographic experimentations (such as typographic
    illustrations or novel use of typefaces)  and writings on the subject of typography.\r\n\r\nThe
    community will be centered around helping improve each other's typefaces through
    critical feedback, ratings, and advise. Students can recognition by having an
    outlet to distribute their typefaces for use by the public.\r\n\r\nWe are also
    looking to get the school faculty involved in curating feature typefaces, as to
    add a layer of credibility to that process."
