body: "Does anyone know how the term \"justified\" came to describe text set with
  both a left and right flush margin?\r\n\r\nCurious after reading the 100th email
  from a colleague refering to \"center justified text.\"\r\n\r\nUh.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance to any combination language and type history buffs."

  body: Justify &gt; Adjust &gt; Align are all closely related, so that justification
    CAN mean alignment to left, right or center, or alignment of both margins. "Justify
    to center" is perhaps a little archaic (or at least arcane, since "justified"
    has come to mean type with both left and right margins aligned.
