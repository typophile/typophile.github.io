  here a few times before and it seems like a good place to ask.\r\n\r\nWhat's a good
  SOHO laser printer for high quality B&W text printing?  I'm not a pro, but I do
  a fair bit of DTP-like stuff and low-volume document printing would benefit from
  better-than-inkjet quality output.\r\n\r\nI have been looking at 1200dpi printers
  in the $300-$400 price bracket but print quality leaves much to be desired.  For
  example, sample prints done on a Brother HL 5240N show that the printer rasterizes
  text at around 200dpi.  The result is unacceptably jagged output that looks awful
  compared to something done on a nine year old 600dpi laser.  I don't know where
  to look from here as the 5240 got top marks for text quality from various review
  outfits, even in competition with higher end printers.\r\n\r\nWhat are people around
  here using for low volume B&W text output that doesn't look like sandpaper?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Yeah, I'm looking too, but only need 8-1/2 x 11 black only becuase I already
    have a larger format color. Hard to find one that is True Postscript.  I have
    an ancient HP Laserjet that has been great, but all the new HPs don't look like
    they are true Postscript.  The Ricoh Aficio SP 4100 looks promising, but is still
    around $700.  Was hoping to keep it under $500. Maybe I'll keep plugging with
    the old HP until it dies.

    I haven't yet got 10.5.2 to print properly, but I mainly use 10.4.11.) If there
    is an issue with these printers then I'd be interested to know what it is. When
    I first got the HP I was a little disappointed by the look of the letter forms
    which did not look the same as the Apple laser printer that I'd been used to.
    I put this down to the fake postscript."

  body: "Hello--I was silly and started my own laser printer thread and was kindly
    directed here by pattyfab. :)  I hope my joining the discussion won't be a hijack...\r\n\r\nI'm
    very interested in the Ricoh Aficio BP20 or BP20N--they're more within my price
    range than the AP or SP series they have. On the specs, however, the BPs say \"PCL
    6\" under \"Printer Languages.\" The AP series lists: Adobe PostScript 3: 136
    Type 1 fonts; PCL: 35 Intellifonts, 10 TrueType fonts, 1 bitmap font. Does this
    mean that the BP models are not PostScript? I'm not very fluent in this PostScript/printing
    language so all I gathered from wiki-ing PCL 6 is that PCL competes with PostScript.
    Does that mean that the BP models are emulators like the HPs you're discussing?\r\n\r\nI
    appreciate your help! Thank you!\r\n\r\n(I'm on OSX Leopard, MBP, running CS3--if
    this matters.)"

  body: "Metalfoot -- For proofing typeface designs, it's very useful to use a printer
    with true Adobe Postscript. Postscript clones may possibly interpret code slightly
    differently -- for example, hinting instructions. Since commercial output for
    print will be processed and rasterized through a true Postscript interpreter,
    it's most useful to be reviewing your work in a workflow as close as possible
    to the likely result. \r\n\r\nFor general design work, there are similar advantages
    -- things like color interpretation, layout features, etc. True Adobe Postscript
    will always be guaranteed of giving you a consistent industry-standard interpretation
    of the code. (There will of course be other limitations, based on the mechanics
    of a desktop laser; postscript rasterization is only one part of the puzzle.)\r\n\r\nThat
    doesn't mean that all PS clones are all rubbish. But you need to investigate to
    know whether a given rasterizer will perform according to your needs and expectations.\r\n\r\n"

  body: How things change. My first PS laser printer, a GCC, cost me GBP 2500 in 1990.
    I got distracted into writing my own PS imposition program but I couldn't afford
    a PS interpreter for the PC (I had no Mac! still don't) to test it on. But the
    printer had a bi-directional serial port. I was able to send my generated PS code
    to it and read back the imposed output (which incorporated page creep allowing
    for folds in both axes, and what-not, and spot ink-trapping) to test on imagesetters.
    Pretty cool solution I thought at the time. As for the program ("Reproshop"),
    as it was on PC I couldn't even give it away. But it's how I learnt programming.
