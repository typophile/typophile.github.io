    1900, when it appeared in Stephenson, Blake & Co. catalog. '

  body: "It's shown as \"Chantry\" in the Solotype Catalog published by Dover Books,
    which only means it was a film type, or something older. Many of these designs
    have been digitized, and I usually note them in my copy of the book, but I have
    no names by that sample, alas.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has digitized it, Dan Solo, David
    Nalle (Scriptorium), or Dieter Steffmann would be the first places I would look.
    Then HiH fonts, who also does revivals of old designs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Tal, to save you some time I looked at Solotype's fonts, HiH's fonts, and
    Scriptorium. This was not in any of those. Dieter Steffman's collection is a little
    hardr to scan, so I put that off. I will also check the Retro fonts at Dafont,
    since some of Dieter's fonts go there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    but these remind me of Chantrey/Chantry. The font is from Letterhead Fonts.\r\n\r\n-
