  (TNS).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typenerd_4076.jpg]\r\n\r\nME:
  \ \r\n\r\nHerewith please find attached evidence of Type Nerd Syndrome.  Last Friday
  Jen McNight, visiting artist, assistant professor at University of Missouri-Saint
  Louis, Daniela Marx, tenured professor of graphic design at Loyola University New
  Orleans and I gamboled and frolicked in this field of type like three kittens playing
  with a ball of string.\r\n\r\nWe each found ourselfs nearly prostrate photographing
  the architectural type being installed in the Loyola library; we photographed each
  other photographing the type, videoed and laughed, we are hoping to make a presentation
  with the captures for TypeCon 2009.  (I began to wonder if this was some symptom
  of a serious illness of which we should be aware.)\r\n\r\nSTEVE MATTESON:      \r\n\r\nType
  Nerd Syndrome (TNS) is a condition which usually starts with a sharp blow to the
  head - physical or chemical - during adolescence.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms are usually
  mistaken for OCD in non-creative people. In professionals it often earns the afflicted
  nicknames like 'Font Police', 'Font Cop', 'Font Nazi' or even.... shudder.... 'Type
  Director'.\r\n\r\nME:\r\n\r\nNow this all makes sense.  When I was young I used
  to climb all over the gym sets in our collective back yards, there were three families
  sharing this strip of land that the dad's made into a playground replete with sand
  and a big \"jungle gym\" made out of that heavy steel piping, as well as some store
  bought swing sets and various other climb-upon things that I don't see much anymore
  (probably because of insurance issues.)\r\n\r\nI used to climb up to the top of
  the big, pipe-metal one and hang upside down from it off of my knees. One day i
  do recall landing on my head rather than swinging, guess my knees decided to play
  a funny trick on me resulting in a sharp blow to the head.  Guess it all started
  for me there.\r\n\r\nSTEVE MATTESON:\r\n\r\nheh - yeah that'd do it for sure. For
  me it was hearing the phone ring upstairs while practicing my drums. Thinking it
  could be 'for me', and quite possibly an 'adoring fan' - I dropped the sticks, jumped
  over a box, leapt for the 3rd stair only to be stopped cold in my tracks by a low
  hanging radiator pipe to the head. The phone kept ringing - at least I think it
  was the phone - as I crumpled to the floor. All the people I've asked, who are 'into
  type', have related similar stories.... Even Chuck Bigelow whose experiences were
  less traumatic and suffered over a period of time in art college."

    he says \"incurable if not mortal disease.\"]] As he thinks it's very clever--and
    he's right!--he has repeated it in different ways on different occasions. That's
    probably the best as it is shortest. "
