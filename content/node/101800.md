    could you explain your logo a bit more? What do the elements represent?\r\n"

  body: "It is a guy on a lightning bolt.. which portrays.. the exponential growth
    of the even in the last few years.. i have to actually revamp the logo for this
    years event.. and it will be \"Footprints X4\" It is the fourteenth consecutive
    year of the event and hence X4.. \r\n\r\nP.S. The tagline of the event is \"Think
    Beyond\""

  body: ">  the exponential growth\r\n\r\nIf you keep that general look, you might
    consider reversing it so the lightening bolt is pointed to the right. Two reasons
    \u2014 since we read from left to right, objects that point to the left can seem
    to be pointing backwards, and also if the lightening bolt represents growth in
    the sense of a graph, you want the graph going up.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-flopped_4785.jpg]"

      like to see it first to make sure.
