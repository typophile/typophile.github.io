body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nafter playing around on Illustrator for a while, I seem to have
  fallen into creating my first typeface. Initially based around impossible shapes
  inspired by Escher etc the typeface soon evolved rather naturally to what you see
  now. Built up by a strict grid all characters are the same width except for the
  m w and i and the numbers are slightly thinner.\r\n\r\nI am looking to open up fontlab
  for the first time and hopefully cement this as a working font. If you guys could
  provide me with your thoughts that would be great, I feel like this is a whole new
  world I have uncovered!\r\n\r\nAlso so far I have created just letters and numbers,
  how many other characters would you advise designing for a display font?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks"

  body: "An Escherian font is a nice idea, and I really like your curvy terminals.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>all
    characters are the same width except for the m w and i</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI can't
    think of a good reason to do that... Either all the characters should be the same
    width (AKA monospace font) which can be a useful feature, or let each character
    be the width it needs.\r\n\r\nBTW, call it Maurits.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Working well: I, K, N, 4 (though the triangular counter is too small), 8\r\nNot
    working: B, 3\r\nQ would be more legible if the tail went rightward instead. \r\nThe
    grid has served its purpose, now be ready to depart from it where useful. "

  body: "Thanks for the replies. My initial plan was to have it monospaced but after
    developing it some letters didnt suit being the same width such as the i. Departing
    from the grid definately seems like a good idea. \r\n\r\nThe terminals were originally
    set as straight 45 degreed lines but I ended up going with the curves to make
    it a bit different. In the end I would quite like to have the curved and straight
    options available.\r\n\r\nI had considered Maurits as the name. I put down Riley
    after Bridget Riley but its all still in consideration and open to offers."

  body: 'Fun idea! Some nice execution, some problems as Craig notes. If you can get
    more depth illusions into some characters, like the C, it would make it more consistent
    and stronger. '

  body: Thanks, I did seem a bit unsure of referring it to Escher when not all the
    letters were impossible shapes! I'll see what I can add to the rest of them

  body: Visual coherence is much more important than relationship to the grid, in
    my opinion, but then I've never tried to stick to a grid. If you have the marked
    depth illusion on all the characters, then those that are impossible will have
    even more punch, I think. Remember they will be in words, so the conflict between
    possible and impossible will have its own play. I think having the terminal curves
    and width more consistent will help a lot. This part needs to be a bit more uniform,
    I think. Eg the C terminals are different.

    a font editor, set some words, and make your decision based on that."

  body: "But David, wouldn't the \"G\" for example benefit from being allowed to be
    wider? As long as even just one letter is breaking the monospace mold (thus making
    the font generally unusable for making everything line up) why not just fugetaboutit?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hrant, I think monospace and modular, are two different things.
