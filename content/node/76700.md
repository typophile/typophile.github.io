  be, for superiors, align them with the top of the body text ascender, then align
  the bottom of the superior with top of the x-height. For subscript, align the top
  of the superior with say half the height of the x-height, then align the bottom
  of the subscript with the descender?\r\n\r\n3. What is the best way to set numbers
  in tables? Should they always be set right aligned and the numbers should not be
  old style, so they align up, and does this really help readers? \r\n"

  body: "1. I think the equation is clearer when you use regular caps.\r\n2. Use a
    font that looks like the one you want to give superiors/subscript which has them
    build in and use it as a guideline. Best is to simply go for a font that has it
    already built in.\r\nUse tabular lining figures, if your font doesn't have that,
    make sure they're all the same width (including spacing+kerning) It doesn't really
    help readers, but it's more comfortable to read, i guess."

  body: "<strong>1</strong>. Good question. I don't see a problem to use small caps
    if they result clearly identified as caps in the formula. But most fonts have
    small caps with the same height of lowercases. This produces rather small characters,
    probably so much small to replace a uppercase in a formula. In other hand, there
    are many new fonts with bigger small caps and this seems to be the best choice.
    Of course, you must do tests to evaluate it better.\r\n\r\n<strong>2</strong>.
    Traditional superscript setting is size reduced to 58% of normal one and position
    with +33% of baseline shift. Nowadays, many designers consider this somewhat small
    and you can find larger superiors in recent fonts (Guardian, Meta, Vesper). Additional
    information [[http://typophile.com/node/16879|here]].\r\n\r\n<strong>3</strong>.
    Numbers in last column at right must be aligned right. To other columns, this
    will depend on your data. If you are handling many columns with numbers, overall
    alignment at right seems better. With decimals, the decimal dot alignment is preferable.
    When mixing text and numbers, I prefer to use left or justified alignment.\r\n\r\nTabular
    numbers makes sense if exact vertical alignment means something to your table.
    For example: accounting data, where reader would compare numbers between different
    lines, is a typical scenario for tabular numbers. But for tables with few numbers,
    menus, timelines or TOCs (for example), tabular figures are not necessary and
    may be even distracting."

  body: "Part of your question is, who are you designing for? If you're entering book
    shows, and your audience is other designers, use small caps everywhere -- Well,
    maybe not to begin a sentence. But I've seen the word \"TiVo\" with small caps
    used for the \"T\" and \"V\". Just because it is hard to read doesn't mean it
    isn't really cool.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the text is suppose to be read
    by people in a particular field, like mathematicians, take a look and see what
    they do. (Hint: I've never seen small caps substituted for full caps in an equation).\r\n\r\nThe
    same would apply for old style versus lining figures in a table. A series of dates
    and dollar amounts, for example, reads quite well when set in os figs, particularly
    in a book dealing with the 19th or earlier centuries. Did you think they didn't
    set tables before Victorian times? Once again, what would the audience be comfortable
    with, on the assumption that audience isn't graphic designers.\r\n\r\nGo to the
    library. Take a look at the first-line journals in the field. When you feel you
    want to challenge their ways of presenting information, write your own book. Keeps
    everybody honest."

  body: "Just one more instance of \"If it's Tuesday, it must be Belgium\" kind of
    thinking. Typically, the widest element in the last column is \"aligned right\"
    i.e., goes to the right edge of the table, but even that is full of assumptions.
    The data may well be decimal aligned, and one element may have more numbers to
    the right of the decimal. The column head too is a factor -- sometimes the shortest
    element in the column head is longer than any entry in the column. If the general
    style of a table is for the data to center under the column heads, a long word
    in the column head may set the right margin. Even more so when the style is for
    the data to be left on the column head.\r\n\r\nThen, not all tables are full measure,
    nor is all placement of tables less than full measure \"right\" or \"left\" on
    the text page.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are the rules -- top, middle, bottom -- that
    can be used to give the table a desired width. Often they are just the width of
    the elements in the table, but they can be extended. Just the ticked when you're
    setting a table on a 26-pica page, but the data, with reasonable gutters, only
    reaches 24 picas. You can ether add space to the gutters, or extend the rules
    to reach 26 picas. If you extend the rules, in effect you have a dummy column
    on both the far left and right of the table. Alternatively, you can set the table
    short, but as it approaches the full measure of the text, that usually looks odd.\r\n\r\nThe
    most common approach with the \"almost\" table above is to just add space to the
    gutters. For those of you who actually read tables, you know that too much gutter
    space can make it hard to follow the alignment of the data in a row. Using a dummy
    left & right column can be a good solution.\r\n\r\nDesigning good tables can be
    as involved as designing a text interior."

    It's completely incorrect to compare my answer, valid for general and most common
    situations, and a nonsense statement as \"If it's Tuesday, it must be Belgium\".
    You don't need to distort my advice to add your own, especially when you are handling
    exceptions to general rules considering other graphic elements and particular
    situations.\r\n\r\n.\r\n<cite>Why must they always be aligned right, out of curiosity?
    I can understand from an aesthetic point of view, but I would think that the readability
    of the column is better when the figures are left-aligned, no?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe
    aesthetic question is relevant. But there is also the readability of numbers.
    If you have just numeric data, right aligment is more adequate because our number
    system is based on RTL position. So, to quickly identify and compare different
    quantities, a right aligment is better because it preserves the position of units,
    tens of units, hundreds etc. The same justifies use of decimal aligment when there
    are numbers with decimals."

  body: "Mr. Freiberger:\r\n\r\nI think the term you want is simply \"decimal aligned.\"
    This applies whether there is an actual decimal or not. It says simply that within
    the column, 1s, 10s, 100s, etc, all share a common vertical position.\r\n\r\nIt
    says nothing about where things are located within the column. That's where the
    miscommunication arises. For example, numbers can first be decimal aligned, then
    centered, flush right, or left.\r\n\r\nWhat does bother me is \r\n\r\n<cite>especially
    when you are handling exceptions to general rules considering other graphic elements
    and particular situations.</cite>\r\n\r\nAh, but who's rules? Readers? Editors?
    Typographers and graphic designers who've done little of either? Or typographers
    and graphic designers who who work a lot with both?"

  body: "Sorry if \"unfair.\" How about this? You're wrong.\r\n\r\nAs a general practice,
    rule or not: with the exception of the stub, the most common arrangement of numerical
    data in a column is decimal aligned, and centered under the column head. The far
    right column should be no exception. In the cases where the column head is shorter
    than the data, the data will perforce be flush right. In my experience, IN GENERAL,
    column heads are wider than the data in their column.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nAnd
    as long as we're going to fight, using small caps in equations goes against all
    established conventions. You might as well say that sentences can begin with small
    caps, except for c, o, u, v, w, x, and z. Get that one by an editor.\r\n\r\nIn
    passing, variables expressed with letters in math are usually set italic. The
    number of fonts with italic small caps is growing, but far from universal.\r\n\r\nIn
    short, your advice sounds uncritical to me; a knee-jerk reaction -- so we're back
    to the old cartoon of Tuesday and Belgium. "
