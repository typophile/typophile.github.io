  the font used on their front covers, the one for the main text of the book).  It
  looks like something from the 1960's, and has nice old style numerals and small
  caps.  I've tried Identifont et al. and they suggest faces that are close, but not
  quite correct (Bodoni Condensed, Century Oldstyle etc.)\r\n\r\nI've attached a small
  excerpt from one of their books (sorry for the quality, it's a scan)."

  body: "In your sample the word CONTENTS at the top is a different font (the C has
    2 serifs). The main text does look like one of the Century's (there are many if
    you use Bitstream's naming).  I cannot see the details clearly enough to use the
    [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif Font ID Guide]],
    but with the original maybe you can try it and see what comes up.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "It's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/monotype-modern/\">Monotype
    Modern</a>, the favored font for math and math-heavy books at the time. It's been
    largely supplanted by <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/monotype-modern/\">Computer
    Modern</a>, the TeX adaptation of the font. Note that the official Monotype digitization
    is not optically scaled, but the Computer Modern version is.\r\n\r\nThis <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=6wSVuWH1PrsC\">book</a>
    is about calculus of variations, which I reference extensively in my <a href=\"http://levien.com/phd/phd.html\">thesis</a>
    on interpolating splines. I looked at a bunch of references and decided on <a
    href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Differential-Equations-Calculus-Variations-Elsgolts/dp/1410210677\">Elsgolts
    </a> instead, largely because his presentation of the Euler-Poisson equation was
    much more direct than most. Note also that this is a republication of the original
    1952 edition, and Dover, as is typical, reproduced page images rather than retypesetting
    the text.\r\n\r\n@bowfinpw: And yes, the \"CONTENTS\" is a different font, possibly
    Baskerville. Also note that the boldface is a not-quite matching font, I think
    it's one of the numbered \"Monotype Old Style\" ones, but I'm not 100% sure."

  body: Ah, cool.  Thanks for that, Monotype Modern looks to be the correct font!  I'm
    actually wanting to use this font in LaTeX to typeset my thesis in, as I prefer
    this font to CM.  Is the lack of scaling in the Monotype official going to be
    a killer?

  body: "Heh, interesting. Yes, the Monotype digital will be impossibly high-contrast
    (hairline serifs way too thin) at normal text sizes. However, you may not be entirely
    out of luck. There's a <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/modern-extended/\">second
    digitization</a> that's quite a bit more robust. You could use this for text and
    the Monotype for larger settings, and get fake scaling. However, if you have lots
    of subscripts or other small type mixed in with the main text, I'd personally
    find the lack of scaling to be disappointing. I expect it from Times, but not
    from this font.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!"

    so it looks like using MM is out (I'd rather stick with CM in that case).\r\n\r\nStephen
    Coles, thanks for the link.  I'll take a look at those!"
