  really driving me crazy! Can anyone help to identify it, please?\r\n\r\nI found
  some somilar in Proxima, Packenham, Mostra Nuova.  but nothing match this profile
  correctly (take a look at the low \"A\" and \"E\" bars, the perfect round \"O\",
  the shape of \"S\" and the proportions of the \"P\" and \"R\").\r\n\r\ni will be
  really grateful to anyone can suggest the right font.\r\nthanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/man_5194.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks, Jan.\r\n\r\nbut Market deco, has different edges for \"Z\", the \"S\"
    in the image has not the same proportions in  lower and upper side. The \"T\"
    has a shorter bar than Maket deco.\r\n\r\nmoreover, i found other prints (how
    I can insert it in this post?). \r\n\r\nthere are differences in the \"Q\", and
    in the \"G\".\r\n\r\nBut the deco is great! if I don't find the real one, i will
    use it...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
