body: " Houschka Rounded is released this week.\r\n\r\nIt is very comprehensive with
  multi-lingual coverage, featuring a standard character set, contextual and stylistic
  alternates, lining and old-style numbers, both proportional and tabular, small caps,
  and 3 extra stylistic sets (as shown on the pdf). \r\n\r\n Houschka Rounded has
  six weights ranging from a very thin Thin to Extra Bold.\r\n\r\nThe Thin style may
  be the thinnest rounded (terminals) font ever! Magnify the 5-spread pdf and have
  a look.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.type.co.uk/pdfpreview/F007329.pdf\">Houschka
  Rounded</a>\r\n"
