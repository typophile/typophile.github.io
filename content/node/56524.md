  body: "Nick: <em>Ergo, all award winners are crap.</em>\r\n\r\nAward competitions
    are judged on the basis of looking at type, not reading it.\r\n\r\nBut John Berry
    has made the now common error of saying 'invisible' when he should say 'transparent'.
    A crystal goblet, to use Beatrice Warde's famous metaphor, isn't invisible, only
    transparant. Like good typography, it doesn't obscure the contents, but it can
    also delight with its own shape."

  body: "John, thanks for that analogy. Although I understood the concept of <em>good
    typography should be invisible</em>, I never agreed with it 100 percent, for the
    obvious reasons. Your analogy has made the concept crystal clear.\r\n\r\nUh oh.
    And the puns begin..."

  body: "I have sometimes used the 'Belgian beer glass' explanation of typography:
    it's transparent, but the shape of the glass tells you what kind of beer is in
    it.\r\n\r\nThis is also, of course, true of wine glasses if one takes the care
    to serve wine in an appropriately shaped glass. In this case, the shape not only
    tells you what kind of wine you are about the drink, but also affects the bouquet
    and flavour."

  body: So there is a twist to the crystal goblet. Nice analogy. I don't drink so
    this wouldn't have occurred to me, but I really like that.
