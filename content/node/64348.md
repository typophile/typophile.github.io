  I'm not decided on the Latin type yet. I may design something myself. However, it
  will be similar to the Plato I have used here. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think of pairing
  it with Avant Garde? Any other suggestions?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_3692.gif]"

    of a Latin font (albeit a rustic, eclectic one) together with the clean, artsy
    look of the Avant Garde.\r\n\r\nOpinions of lower case versus all-caps? I realize
    the actual company name will make a difference on that. But overall, what do you
    think?\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the business currently uses Avant Garde in its logo,
    with no other type. That's why I continued using it. Does it work? If not, do
    you have suggestions?\r\n\r\nOr, do you have another Latin type suggestion?"

  body: "I think the Latin part should be all-caps. If there's a \"U\" in there you
    might even show it as a \"V\". :-)  The subtext could be lc (maybe all-lc) but
    with a nicely contrasting font it doesn't have to be. In any case I'd avoid Avant
    Garde. It smells moldy. You don't want moldy furniture.\r\n\r\nAlso, the weathered
    idea make me uneasy. But it depends on what kind of customers the client wants.
    And that central question should guide the choice of an Avant Garde replacement.\r\n\r\nNick,
    that's more Greek than Latin.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, my point is that there are two ways to approach Latin-ness.\r\nEither
    through authenticity (Trajan) or through popular (mis)perception (Caesar's Palace).\r\n\r\nIMO,
    some of the Shaw/Boge types would be good for \"Latin\", e.g. Donatello, Ghiberti,
    Beata.\r\nBased on Italian Renaissance inscriptions, they combine the authentic
    classic proportions of Latin antiquity with a slightly hewn effect, to satisfy
    the popular conception of something a bit rustic. A clean sans to complement such
    faces could be Futura, with its Classically proportioned capitals."
