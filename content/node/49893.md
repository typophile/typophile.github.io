  simple pixel font. I posted earlier another design - a helvetica-like sans  (http://typophile.com/node/49228)
  and the pixel font here is the equivalent of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used the free font
  editor Fony. The font was set at 9 points (12 depending on dpi).\r\n\r\nPlease let
  me know what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Test_Carpathica_Px4_5204.PNG]"

  body: Well, somehow you ended up with a short H, but otherwise it looks like you
    did all right. Maybe the space is a little wide. There are a few strange choices
    among the symbols, such as how the colon and semicolon don't match, and the very
    low-seated equal sign.

  body: The space is much too wide, actually. You should probably decrease it by at
    least half. :)

  body: Actually, when you make a pixel font you have two choices, two pixel breaks
    or one. If you two as we see here it looks too wide. If yo go one then then it
    seems too tight. The main culprit in the over wide look is the r. r c ra r anything
    looks too wide. It's not a monospace so loose a pixel next to the r and you should
    have a better look.

  body: We were talking about the space (that goes between words), not the letterspacing.
    But that's a good point about the right sidebearing of the r, and I'd say the
    same of the f. In fact, for f, it could even go down to negative one.
