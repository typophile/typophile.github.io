  body: "It looks like a cleaned-up version of [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg14.html|\"Spoleto\"]]
    (a.k.a. Opti Sport Script), which has come up often here. The original had uneven
    strokes and this looks smoother, but the feel is similar. The popularity of this
    design has led to a number of imitations, but I couldn't find an exact match for
    this sample. Search on sports or baseball script for other similar styles.\r\n\r\n-
