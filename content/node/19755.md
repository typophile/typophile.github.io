  by [[FontFont]]\r\nDesigned by [[Verena Gerlach]], [[Ole Sch\xE4fer]], 2000\r\n\r\nFor
  decades two different signage systems divided East and West Berlin. The West used
  a sans serif dating back to the 30s, while the East preferred a technically-tinted
  sans face from the 50s. Ole Sch\xE4fer and Verena Gerlach based their designs on
  the street signs themselves rather than the sketches from which the signs were made.
  This resulted in there being two versions for the East and a single version for
  the West. The FontFont character set includes many characters that would never be
  found on a street sign so Sch\xE4fer and Gerlach designed the missing letters, punctuation
  and symbols. They also designed special headline fonts for both East and West available
  in three weights: Regular, Medium and Bold. In addition, they created lining figures
  and, for the expert sets, a series of arrows and other useful symbols.\r\n\r\n<strong>External
