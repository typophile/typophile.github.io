  help in analysing the current company logo, it's colours, the impression it gives,
  its design and what could be done to improve it, to make it stronger. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/epitiro-strap-neg-50mm-hr_5330.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  company test and measure fixed and mobile broadband network performance for broadband
  providers and regulators from across the world so they know how their customers
  experience across their network and where there is a need to invest in order to
  improve the performance of their mobile or fixed network and thus allowing to leverage
  customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\nEpitiro is a latin name meaning \"to watch over\".\r\n\r\nI
  look forward to read your comments.\r\n\r\nThanks to all."

  body: Rather than fixing up this, they should hire a designer (or are you the designer?).
    The concept and execution is weak.

  body: "The logo is poorly drawn, where shapes 'break' other shapes make sure they
    follow the same line smoothly without sharp edges. \r\nMaybe consider a stronger
    use of a highlight colour? Looks a bit weak. \r\nTypography wyse I have no issues
    with the typeface but maybe try a different weight for the bullets underneath?
    Consider this in full upper case? Maybe lighter? \r\nWork on kerning of letters
    especially in Epitiro as it stands out awkwardly. "

  body: thanks Twiggy, very useful comments. What about the strapline, isn't it too
    long or is it acceptable?

  body: "Valerie: What Twiggy said. The Nike-ish swashes are very clich\xE9. Are they
    supposed to picture a satellite in orbit? Also, Optima does not really say \u201Ctech\u201D
    in any way. It would be better to start from scratch, IMO. "

  body: I am a technical person and happen to be very familiar with the area your
    company operates in. I think the visual aspect of the branding is off - the colors,
    the mark and the typeface. Especially, the typeface. It is overly delicate for
    a technical company. It would be a better fit for an arts supply company or some
    such. A simpler straight-forward sans serif would IMO work here better. Look at
    what Agilent, Keynote or Webmetrics use. Or Akamai.

  body: "The mark looks like it could be for Nytol, something to do with the moon,
    being wrapped up in a nice warm duvet cuddling a pillow. Not very tech, secure
    but more maternal than robust. The font too does not convey tech and whilst the
    strapline is not long, for me it looks odd aligned to the descender of the p.\r\nBut
    as nothing of the mark reflects the meaning of Epitiro and the mark and the font
    selection do not communicate a technological company, the least of the concerns
    is the spacing of a strapline."

  body: "Someone's sure to cock a snook at me for this, since I'm not a designer,
    let alone a schooled designer, but here's a logo idea...\r\n\r\nTake a sky blue
    background and add three horizontal lines converging to parallel (like the Atari
    logo), with the top line being the tail of a lower-case 'e'. Let the lines end
    at the right in an arrow formation as if they were contrails of a Red Arrows fly-by.\r\n\r\nSet
    'pitiro' all-upper in an extended Microgramma/Eurostile/Square 721 following the
    'e'. Set your strapline in a fat small-caps sans (I'm thinking a mixed heavy/black
    extended Helvetica (Neue)/Swiss 721) with triangular bullets pointing rightwards.\r\n\r\nLooks
    quite punchy and more tech-savvy in my mind than the current 'child healthcare'
    logo."
