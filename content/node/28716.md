  had an inquiry since we made the Puma shirt numbers but don't know who made the
  France shirt numbers for Adidas. It is similar to the Mexico Olympic logo and the
  designer of that wants to know if Adidas nicked it."

    the wrong angle.  The trouble with geometric figures is that it is too easy to
    come up with the same solution as someone else without even trying.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Adidas and some teams like Ajax and Real Madrid. As far as I could discover the
    companies that produce the transfers play an important role. There are some big
    companies in this area like Chris Kay and Metro Sport, but they didn''t give information
    about the designers of the shirt numbers. '

    by TypeType. Similar shapes, less lines. Maybe as a basis for the customization?
    \r\n\r\nEDIT: Naw, not really. Too many differences. "
