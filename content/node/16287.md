body: "I am currently working on designing a book of poetry and photographs. The author
  and I have been discussing using a small illustration or ornament to mark the end
  of each poem and we would like it to reflect the central theme of the work: time.
  The text will be set in Hoefler Text, so I'd like the illustration to work well
  in conjunction with this typeface. I've attached two PDF's (page view and detail)
  of my idea and would appreciate your comments/suggestions. I'm not a type designer,
  so I feel like I'm a bit over my head on this one...\r\n\r\nIn addition to any comments
  on this particular ornament I'm designing, I would love to hear more about how (or
  even why!) type designers go about designing ornaments for their typefaces? I've
  had a look at some of the Hoefler Text ornaments, but I don't really understand
  their unifying characteristics. Is there anything in particular that I should be
  looking out for?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nScott"

  body: "The ornament seems ambiguous to me, it could be half an orange, a moon, etc.
    The weight of the strokes could also be a problem, they seem too varied to work
    with the text at twelve point, I also think that the execution of the clock face
    needs to be refined. \r\nI think you should investigate other methods to represent
    time, maybe with a less three dimensional appearance, hourglasses (there is one
    in Hoefler Ornaments) and sundials come to mind or a more conventional representation
    of a clock face. Hoefler Ornaments contain traditional items and styles, hedera
    \u2013 the ivy and plant-based ones, the printer's fist \u2013 pointing hand,
    sun and moon and fleur de lys.\r\nTim"

    body: "Thanks for your comments Tim. The ambiguity in the ornament was intentional;
      we were trying to suggest a few different ideas of time, so I don't mind if
      the ornament takes on a few different meanings, as long as they are related
      to the overall theme. I would really appreciate it if you could elaborate on
      why the variation in the strokes doesn't work with the type. The existing Hoefler
      text ornaments seem to vary quite a bit when it comes to stroke width, overall
      colour, etc. That's what I find confusing about the design of ornaments. How
      closely should they reflect the characteristics of the typeface?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nScott"

  body: "Scott,\r\nI was trying  to say that the variation of the strokes in the ornament
    might not represent too well at twelve points high, some being so fine they will
    be difficult to print/see at a small size, some of the clock face details will
    also be difficult to print. So it was a more technical criticism in that respect.
    \r\nLooking at the Hoefler Text Ornaments, I would suggest that you wouldn't use
    the more detailed ornaments (sun, moon, ship etc.) or the incised uppercase hedera
    at the same point size as the lowercase flourishes and hedera. Whereas the incised
    flourishes could be used at the same point size as the lowercase flourishes. Of
    course, the option for using that many ornaments will not come along often.\r\nAs
    to how closely they should reflect characteristics of the text, I think that is
    a question that you can only answer by trying different sorts, sizes, position
    and proximity of ornament in conjunction with a piece of text, experiment, bearing
    in mind the effects of printing will have on text and ornament. However, I wish
    in the case of Hoefler's ornaments, that those flourishes weren't simply reflected,
    but that the emphasis of thick and thins were kept in the style of the text face.\r\nGetting
    back to your design, bearing in mind that the present lack of images means I am
    relying on my memory, my first reaction was that it was an orange, which I take
    it wasn't the intention, it seems to me that a clearer representation of time
    would achieve your ends better than any ambiguity.\r\nTim"
