body: "Hi,\r\nI'm looking for examples of rounded contemporary typefaces in use, either
  from the web, printed matter, signage, your holiday photos, whatever (e.g. General
  Electric identity, Thisnext.com website, Telewest identity (rip), images of Bryant
  in use from Process).\r\nTypefaces suggestions are welcomed but not really necessary
  since I already made a good list of them. Now I'm looking for images to support
  my font researches with something real and concrete.\r\nYou know, a pdf specimen
  is rarely enough to persuade a client of a good typeface!\r\nThank you all!"
