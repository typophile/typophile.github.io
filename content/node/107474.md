body: "I am trying to build fontforge from source on Mac OS X Snow Leopard. I got
  the latest source from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/fontforge/files/fontforge-source/
  I DO NOT want to use homebrew! I repeat DO NOT! cuz I want to have fontforge install
  to a different location than /usr/local/Cellar/fontforge/20120731/ i want it to
  install to /fontforge/ and I can do this when I compile like this:\r\n\r\nIn Terminal
  under the fontforge src directory \"fontforge-20120731-b\" I type:\r\n\r\n./configure
  --prefix=/fontforge --with-freetype-src=/freetype\r\n\r\nfollowed by:\r\n\r\nmake\r\n\r\nand
  finally:\r\n\r\nmake install\r\n\r\nAND THAT ALL WORKS! BUT HERE'S MY PROBLEM!\r\n\r\nwhen
  I run fontforge and try to open a woff file, it says \r\n\"This version of fontforge
  cannot handle WOFF files. You need to recompile it with libpng and zlib\"\r\n\r\nnow
  what the heck does that mean EXACTLY?? like I downloaded the sources for libpng-1.6.7
  and zlib-1.2.8, unzipped them and placed the folders in the fontforge source folder
  and tried to recompile fontforge using the same commands above but it didnt create
  the necessary libraries (libpng.dylib, etc) so im guessing I have to add something
  to the configure command to tell it where the libpng and zlib sources are located?
  am i right? something like this (except this doesnt work, it was just a guess):\r\n\r\n./configure
  --prefix=/fontforge --with-freetype-src=/freetype --with-libpng-src=/libpng\r\n\r\nso
  how exactly am i supposed to do this?\r\n\r\nyour help is much appreciated thank
  you!\r\n"
