body: "Ok, so I was bored on my train ride this weekend and so I took out my sketchbook
  and started drawing. I digitized it a work today. I've never really ventured into
  drawing a 'custom' script so I tried it with my name. Thoughts? I know it still
  needs refining but general ideas about it would be awesome! Critiques, opinions,
  thoughts, comments etc are all welcome!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/davebaileyscript2ok.gif]"

  body: First thing I think you should work on is the consistancy of the thicks and
    thins. The D seems fat and the y skinny. It has a fun lively feel, good start.

  body: Agreed, the D did seem a little too wide and the strokes seemed a little too
    thick. I see your comment about the y now too!

    body: "I've been lurking around for a while, and finally decided to get in on
      the action. This caught my eye, and begged me to post my thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe
      first thing I noticed was that the \"ave\" and the \"iley\" look like separate
      designs. The \"ave\" has a twisted, unconventional feel to it, while \"iley\"
      looks like more of a traditional script. Also, the curly piece at the top of
      the \"D\" looks a bit forced, I like how the \"B\" looks and would try and model
      the \"D\" after it. The dot on the \"i\" is awesome, make sure you keep it as
      this progresses. I would love to see this deveop into a finished piece, please
      continue posting your updates.\r\n\r\nTravis"

  body: "David, I think you're on to something really unique with the a, and v in
    Dave. The other characters look more like traditional sign painter script. So,
    I agree with Travis that the characters don't really flow well together yet, but
    it's a good start.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I've doodled a lot of script letters
    myself for fun, and they are deceptively hard to do."

  body: "Thanks guys for your posts, this is encouraging me to go back to this! I
    don't have a desk at my apartment so I'll have to get to this inbetween projects
    at my internship. I put it on the backburner after there seemed to be no interest
    in it...\r\n\r\nTravis: I'll get rid of the curly bit at the top of the D, because
    I've had thoughts about it feeling forced but your response confirms it. I fell
    in love with the dot over the \"i\" too...probably my favorite part of the design.
    It's funny how the smallest things can become the most exciting!\r\n\r\nChris:
    So it seems as if I should try to rethink this based on the \"a\" and \"v\"?"

  body: "The internship is going great! I love the Art Directors at RCA, they're both
    really fun, knowledgable and talented. My boss who oversees all the creative work,
    both print and video is awesome as well. I often find myself staying late even
    though I'm not getting paid. I don't know how I'm going to be able to go back
    to school in the spring. :-/ The lack of monetary income is the only downside.
    Manhattan has been a great expereience, beside the fact that I can't freakin find
    another part time job....so many r\xE9sum\xE9s and interviews but still nothing.
    It's a good thing I had a decent savings before I got here.\r\n\r\nI hope to make
    a good judgement on this city by the time I leave and then after school spend
    some time on the west coast (San Francisco area) since a good portion of the design
    industry seems to be happening out there now. That is all dependednt on me finding
    a job etc, still too far away to really plan for though! Thanks for asking!"

  body: Well, I just thought the a and e looked particularly unique. The way the letters
    narrowed down to a line where the a and e connect. I just don't recall having
    seen something like that. So it almost seems like there are 2 different ideas
    happening there. Good luck with it, it's a good start.

    on this fun little exercise, David. I wish I had the time and ambition for stuff
    like this! :)\r\n\r\nLovin' the '<em>ave</em>' even more now ... but the '<em>D</em>'
    still seems divorced from the word somehow to me. Sharp pointy stroke ends, maybe?
    Verticals too swooping to the left? I can't quite put a finger on  it. "

  body: I looked at the dot over the i, and after falling in love with it's form I
    developed the other characters based upon it. I'll keep posting progress throughout
    the day, I agree with the pointiness becoming a contrasting problem in the design.

  body: "While I like the basic shape of the characters, the joins seem forced, especially
    between ave. The a needs some form of stress on the righthand vertical.\r\nI wonder
    if the characters are too close together for the joins to lose the forced, cramped
    feel.\r\nTim"

  body: "To me the stress needs to go on the top right corner of the a on the inside
    of the open counter. The joins still need something to raise them, maybe you could
    investigate how they change if you try painting this up with a brush and ink.
    Load up the brush and try repeating one group of letters at a time (ave & ailey)
    until you get a really smooth fast movement, I suspect the joins on ave are too
    contrived, because those of ailey work better and that the painting exercise will
    give you more modulation of stroke.\r\nTim"
