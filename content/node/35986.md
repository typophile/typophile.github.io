  to substitute the glyphs of one group by those of another. However, it doesn't replace,
  let's say, the nth glyph of one with the nth glyph of the other, although the order
  of the glyph groups is right. Everything gets scrambled when it gets through this
  particular lookup. Any ideas?"

  body: "When you're substituting one group for another, the glyphs of both groups
    must be in the same relative order within the font's <em>glyph palette</em>, <strong>not</strong>
    just the group definition*.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you want to substitute
    superiors for lining digits. Your lining digits 'zero' through 'nine' occupy glyphs
    24 through 33. Your superiors must be at glyph <em>n</em> through <em>n + 9</em>.
    So if the 'zerosuperior' is at glyph 140, 'ninesuperior' should be at glyph 149
    and the other superiors in sequence between the two. If there are gaps or inconsistent
    ordering in either the \"to\" or \"from\" groups, you will get strange results
    as you describe (for example if you have 'onesuperior' at glyph 141, 'twosuperior'
    at glyph 150, etc.).\r\n\r\n[[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT%20Release%20Notes/gsub.mspx#groups|*
