body: In the spirit of dusting off work in progress, here&#39;s a specimen of a face
  I&#39;m working on. This is an early port I made to the Mac several months ago to
  see how it looks on screen- The actual font is being designed on my Palm Vx, and
  I can already notice changes from this specimen.  <BR> <BR>How small can you go
  and maintain legibility? By allowing the ascenders and descenders to define the
  word shape, the 4px x-height is surprisingly readable. I&#39;m curious to hear your
  thoughts. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/227.gif"

    normally use caps, but you never know what could be useful, so... <BR> <BR>Very
    smart to sacrifice some x-height discrimination in favor of boumas &#40;word shapes&#41;.
    But the clogging in &#34;e&#34; and &#34;g&#34; &#40;and in &#34;a&#34;, &#34;s&#34;
    and &#34;z&#34; to a lesser extent&#41; is a problem. <BR> <BR>Even in a 4pix
    x-height there are ways to avoid clogging, although it leads to some unconventional
    forms. For example, a 4pix bicameral &#34;a&#34; is one where the bottom row of
    a conventional 5-pix bicameral &#34;a&#34; is dumped &#40;and the same could be
    done for the &#34;e&#34;, but at the top&#41;. For the &#34;g&#34;, I&#39;d go
    with the Koch form &#40;again&#41;. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s tempting to fall back on
    mono forms for &#34;a&#34; and &#34;g&#34;, but the bi forms are what would make
    Benson Linear unique, and I&#39;m glad to see you going for them. <BR> <BR>As
    for the caps, I think there are some legibility issues &#40;like the &#34;B&#34;&#41;.
    BTW, since you have 2 pixels of descender, have you considered taking the caps
    one pixel lower than the lc baseline? I think they can afford to be bigger anyway.
    <BR> <BR>Anyways, keep it up! <BR> <BR>hhp '

    tempting to align the excalamation &#40;and question&#41; marks with the UC and/or
    ascender height, but in actual text setting, where does the mark usually end up?
    After a string of mostly x-height glyphs. In text setting apparent size is much
    more important than alignment &#40;which I feel is generally a very superficial
    merit in a text face&#41;. Since the question mark has a much stronger top than
    the exclamation, it only makes sense for the latter to go taller. <BR> <BR>Note:
    Thanks to OpenType you can now make exclamation marks of varying height, and specify
    which one to use when. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    should that be 20-40?&#41;, and I have difficulty with it on screen. I think that
    has nothing to do with the traditional reasons that a font is not legible, but
    to do with the normal tendency of the brain to seek out familiar pattern - and
    the fact that at this size that just isn&#39;t happening. At least not for my
