body: A question I've never directly posed, waiting for the answer to become apparent
  over time (still a relative newcomer), is whether there are conventions regarding
  body text sizing in whole or perhaps half point size increments? In book layouts,
  I often find myself using the work of others as a template, and the point size of
  the body sometimes appears to be in half increments or even something odder than
  quarter point size increments. Do my eyes deceive, and do most designers/typsetters
  adhere to standardized sizings for body text (10, 11, 12 pt)? At present, I'm tempted
  to set something in 11.25 Dante MT.

    the best choice to keep readability up and paper usage down, go for it.

  body: It is true that computers can ask a laser printer to produce type in odd point
    sizes. However, if type in a document does not seem to have an even point size,
    another possible cause is that it was set to an exact size... of Didot points.

      (4, 9, 16, 25), modular...</cite>\r\n\r\nIt is true that before the point size
      system we now use was adopted, other schemes were tried based on different principles.\r\n\r\nIn
      1822, George Bruce proposed a system in which every size of type would be related
      to the next one smaller by a constant ratio, the sixth root of two:\r\n\r\nPica:
      12 points\r\nSmall Pica: 10.69 points\r\nLong Primer: 9.52 points\r\nBourgeois:
      8.49 points\r\nBrevier: 7.56 points\r\nMinion: 6.73 points\r\n\r\nIn 1824, James
      Fergusson proposed a system in which 14 lines of Nonpareil type was the fundamental
      unit, and all the other sizes of type were aliquot parts of that unit:\r\n\r\nPica:
      12 points\r\nSmall Pica: 10 1/2 points\r\nLong Primer: 9 1/3 points\r\nBourgeois:
      8 2/5 points\r\nBrevier: 7 7/11 points\r\nMinion: 7 points\r\n\r\nSo it is indeed
      true that other mathematical relationships between the different sizes of type
      were considered before the simplest system, multiples of a basic unit, was accepted.
      Of course, that system was the most convenient for allowing a limited number
      of thicknesses of leading to be used to align different type sizes.\r\n\r\nJohn

  body: "I agree with the others that it doesn't matter. \r\n\r\nThe only argument
    I can think of against it is that odd sizes may make it harder to notice a sizing
    mistake when you glance at the character palette. If you're setting 10/12, a quick
    glance at the palette will confirm if you're using the right size, but if you're
    setting 10.25/11.75, those extra digits may make it easier to overlook a sizing
    mistake when you're tired or in a hurry.  But I don't think that's anything to
    really worry about, especially since you'll probably be using style sheets anyway."

  body: "When I served my time as a comp. in the 1960s, my boss was an old guy aged
    63. He knew the old point sizes and would often refer to primer (he pronounced
    it primma), long primer and minion.\r\n\r\nLarge woodletter type, above 72 pt
    was referred to as, for example, 12 line. This would be 144 pt or 12 picas.\r\n\r\nOur
    standard range of point sizes for most faces went 6\u20148\u201410\u201412\u201414\u201418\u201424\u201430\u201436\u201448\u201460\u201472.
    For a few faces we also had intermediate sizes, usually 9 and 11 pt. Mostly, the
    size range was dictated by the foundry, for founders' type and, of course, the
    needs of the work in hand.\r\n\r\nOdd but somehow I still feel very slightly uncomfortable
    using a size outside of this range. I think it's because I became so familiar
    with these sizes that I know exactly what I'm getting so to speak and going outside
    this feels slightly anarchic. Weird."

    recall how that same boss would sometimes hand me a piece of type he was working
    with and say "What's this?" I would identify the character as, maybe, "A 6pt Bodoni
    Bold lowercase i", meanwhile thinking "You mean you can't see that? Isn't it obvious?"
    Now that I am the age he was then, I know how he felt.

    delta hints are hints that trigger adjustments at certain sizes, are there ramifications
    for delta-hinted fonts of using fractional point sizes?\"\r\n\r\nDelta hints trigger
    adjustments at certain pixel per em sizes, not at point sizes, so no, fractional
    point sizes don't ramify, as such a size is rounded to a whole pixel value by
    the time deltas strike.\r\n\r\nAnd, when you're dealing with screen fonts, unless
    the per inch resolution of the device is a multiple of 72, almost none of the
    sizes one sees or selects actually are whole numbers if considered in points.
    E.g. a 10 point font on a 72 dpi device is 10 pixels. One point is one pixel.
    But a 96 dpi device has 1.333 points per pixel. So at 10 point, 10 x 1.333 = 13.33.
    Since this rounds to 13 pixels, what you see is really 9.7 point, or whatever."
