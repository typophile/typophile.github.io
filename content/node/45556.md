body: "Hi again everyone,\r\n\r\ni am looking at the way old typefaces have been tweaked
  to form new, revised versions of themselves, by either varying their x-heights or
  contrasts etc. I am also interested to find out what typefaces have been influenced
  by older typefaces in that they look very similiar to the old one but are not part
  of it. \r\n\r\nCan anyone share some examples of type that has been tweaked?\r\nmany
  thanx !"

    and Optima Nova is an example of a 50+ year revisit, augmentation, expansion and
    adjustment for technology. And OH what a revision! He added titling as well as
    condensed faces. In the calligraphic field we would refer to it as a master stroke
    of genius.\r\nMichael"

  body: "Stephen, you are too kind. Sentico is so obviously appropriated from Klavika.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the DTP types are another matter entirely, as they combine shapes and letters
    from a variety of existing faces, seemingly to mask their derivative basis. At
    best, these might be called collages. \r\n\r\nYour question opens a [[http://typophile.com/node/45435|familiar
