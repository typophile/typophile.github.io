  body: "Print it out and look at it. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that that it is too much
    text on the back, not only from a graphic design standpoint, but from a more general
    communications standpoint. It's basically five taglines, while it's normal to
    present one, or at most two, taglines.  This gives the feeling that the company
    is just throwing out slogans w/o focus.\r\n\r\nDon't use underlining to emphasize
    text - it interferes with the letters. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the front, having that
    dark bar in the middle splits the card up too much.  if you really want the dark
    bar, have it behind just the uppermost info (the company name) so it's at the
    edge of the card. But I don't think it helps at all.\r\n\r\nAlso, on the front
    the darker text stands out more, so I think you should use darker text for the
    important content (such as the email address) and lighter colored text for the
    generic phrases such as \"Email.\""

  body: "Thanks for the feedback. Here's another image of the front. I darkened the
    text, inverse the bolding and removed the blue bar.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Front3b-vin_6126.png]\r\n\r\nI'll
    work on the back now. How is this for the front?"

  body: "I agree with @hola. All your text seems to be tracked very tight... And if
    you want to make it interesting, maybe you should play with the shape of the bar,
    since your logo symbol has organic shapes. Take the bottom line of your logo symbol
    and enlarge it to a bar and enclose text into it. That will work much better than
    static horizontal bar.\r\n\r\n"
