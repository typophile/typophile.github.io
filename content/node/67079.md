body: "Hey there guys. I'm having a problem with fontlab studio here at the office
  in which I can't seem to properly activate the tools in edit mode, they don't appear.
  What can I do? This should be so simple, but really I have no idea why the only
  mode where I can do anything at all is in sketch mode. If someone, please, I can't
  do anything at all like this, and since I've never worked with this tool, I'm getting
  completely frustrated!\r\nThanks in advance."
