  body: "Thank you Don and Ryuk, \r\nI agree with you both that is doesnt look exactly
    like Helvetica Inserat, so the case is still mysterious, but thanks a lot Ryuk
    for suggesting Chalet Comprim\xE9. \"Hong Kong 1960\" works absolutely right for
    me. "

    and even if it looks a bit different to me and I'm not talking about the collateral
    damage of the all-around blur. \r\nDepending on what you need, I'd probably suggest
    to switch for [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chaletcomprime|Chalet Comprim\xE9]]."
