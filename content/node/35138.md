body: "Over <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/9913\">here</a> Paul Hunt was asking
  about how to deal with the Unicode unification of the hooked f and florin as a single
  character. This strikes me as a build issue, so I'm posting comments here.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn
  the general case of two possible forms for a single Unicode character you usually
  need to decide two things:\r\n\r\n1. Which form will be the default, i.e. which
  glyph will be mapped to the Unicode character directly in the cmap table.\r\n\r\n2.
  What method will be used access the second form, i.e. in what layout feature is
  it appropriate to map the non-default glyph to the default glyph?\r\n\r\nThe fhook
  / florin case is a troubling one, though, because there isn't an obvious answer
  to the second question. Personally, I think it was a really bad unification in Unicode:
  the florin should have been encoded separately in the currency symbol block. But
  it is much too late to do anything about that.\r\n\r\nI usually make a font-level
  distinction about this character. If a font has limited language support, e.g. it
  only supports the Latin 1 character set or one of its derivatives (Mac Roman, MS
  codepage 1252, etc.) I'll encode a florin symbol glyph a U+0192. If a font supports
  a wider range of languages, including languages that use the hooked f as a letter,
  then I'll encode a normal lowercase hooked f glyph at U+0192. The choice can be
  simplified like this: Does the font contain an uppercase hooked F (U+0191)? If so,
  then the U+0192 should be the letter not the currency symbol.\r\n\r\nIt would be
  possible, in the latter case, to include a special florin currency symbol glyph
  simply as a stylistic variant, but my inclination would be not to. The straight,
  lowercase hooked f is recognisable as a florin sign, and there is a risk of ending
  up with the wrong glyph in text where the hooked f letter is desired, which would
  be very bad.\r\n\r\nA more troubling aspect of the hooked f is that a regular italic
  f very often has a hooked descender, and is confuseable with the hooked f: <em>f
  \u0192.</em> So in font families that support languages that use the hooked f as
  a letter, you need to make a decision about how to design the normal italic f? Do
  you draw it without a descender? Do you draw it with a straight descender? Do you
  draw it with a reduced lower terminal? Or do you draw it with the hooked terminal
  but provide one of the other forms as a stylistic variant for use by people who
  need to make a distinction with the hooked f?"

    a separate thread, &c, but thank you for giving your take, John.\r\n\r\n<em>Personally,

    encoded separately in the currency symbol block. But it is much too late to do

    Your solution is very straightforward, I had decided to make the hooked-f the
    default in a project i'm working on and was mostly wondering how to handle the
    florin, but i think the florin consideration is not that important."

    problem with many of the hooked letters for African languages, especially in italic
    fonts where the hook could be confused as just a chancery swash."

  body: "<em>What about using the \u2019locl\u2019 (locale) OT feature to help the
    distinction between the two forms?</em>\r\n\r\nYou mean for distinction to distinguish
    a variant italic f from the italic hooked f? Yes, this would be possible, although
    I'm not sure exactly for what languages it would be appropriate. I'll see if I
    can draw up at least a partial list and post it here.\r\n\r\nOne of the fonts
    for which I've been asked to include support for U+0192 as a letter uses it in
    a romanisation scheme for ancient semitic scripts. So one might end up with a
    'latn' script tag and e.g. a 'HEB' language system tag, i.e. Hebrew written in
    the Latin script. This is certainly possible in the context of OpenType Layout
    architecture, but I wonder into what application support issues this might run?"

    of the languages that use/will be using the hooked f are still developing standard
    orthographies, or they have not been recorded yet. Is that correctly stated, John?
    I guess you could always use a stylistic set, but that's a bit inelegant isn't
    it?"

  body: "The relative instability and/or lack of record for developing orthographies
    may be an issue, but it isn't necessarily a major problem. It can become a problem
    if application developers assume a relationship between the misnamed OpenType
    'language system' tags and natural language tags for e.g. spellchecking, hyphenation,
    etc. But if it is possible to access the OT Layout tags independently, then users
    have a mechanism to select the typographic conventions that they want, and the
    association to particular languages is simply a convenience.\r\n\r\n<em>I guess
    you could always use a stylistic set, but that\u2019s a bit inelegant isn\u2019t
    it?</em>\r\n\r\nEven if I were using the language system tags for this sort of
    thing, I would still also provide access via a stylistic set. I don't think this
    is 'inelegant': there is a variant form of the f in an italic font, and some users
    may wish to deploy it. There is an orthographic reason for the variant to exist,
    and some users may require it to make an orthographic distinction, but others
    may simply like that form."

    History is real too. :)
