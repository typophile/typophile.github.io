body: What is the easiest way to kern non-Latin characters in FontLab? I&#39;m doing
  some cyrillic stuff right now and am wondering do i hafta type in /afii100XX for
  every character? or is there an easier way? What would happen if i renamed all the
  cyrillic characters to something like A.cyr, BE.cyr, VE.cyr, etc.? Are there any
  problems with doing this that I&#39;m not aware of? Any advice would be much appreciated.
  Thnx!

  body: 'I use three different naming conventions for Cyrillic glyphs, depending on
    what I&#39;m trying to do, and employ Adam Twardoch&#39;s <a href="http://steroids.fontlab.net/">rename
    glyph Python script</a> to switch between them. The glyph names in the final font
    should either be afii names or uniXXXX form names, so that these can be parsed
    by Acrobat. [If you don&#39;t care about Acrobat you can use whatever names you
    want in the final font; if it&#39;s a TTF, you can also save space by using a
    format 3 post table, which contains no names &#40;but I&#39;m not aware of any
    generally available tools that have this option&#41;.] <BR> <BR>If you want to
    use mnemonic production names for things like kerning, you certainly can. I use
    this particular convention for Cyrillic: /c.A/ /c.Be/... &#40;I like to put the
    script identifier before the letter name&#41; <BR> <BR>I am attaching a couple
    of files that you may find useful. The first is a set of Cyrillic kerning word
    lists using my production names. The second is a set of renaming files that can
    be used with Adam&#39;s script to jump from my production names to either afii
    or uniXXXX form names. <BR> <BR>Note that the kerning words are Russian-specific.
    I don&#39;t have extended Cyrillic kerning lists yet, so you won&#39;t get perfect
    kerning for all languages if you rely solely on these lists, but they&#39;re good
    for establishing that basic values and relationships. <BR> <BR>The .ren files
    cover all Cyrillic glyphs in Unicode, including the recently added extension block.
    Note that I&#39;ve not included smallcaps in either the kerning or .ren files,
    but they could be added easily enough. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: TiroCyrKerning-49062.zip*mime_zip.gif*application/x-zip-compressed*22.8*Tiro+Cyrillic+word+lists*TiroCyrKerning%2ezip

  body: MacOS 9 is quite careless about glyph names, but Mac OS X is quite the opposite.
    You can expect most unpredictable results unless the glyphs are named properly.
    One approach that does work for sure is working in &#34;Codepages&#34; view and
    applying Glyph&#62;Glyph Names&#62;Reencode glyphs&#62;MacOS Cyrillic, and properly
    setting all values to &#34;Cyrillic&#34; in &#34;Encoding and Unicode&#34; sections
    of Font Info. So beware of custom names, only the afii ones do work in all cases,
    including Windows-destined fonts. Note that Cyrillic Type 1 fonts generated from
    FL4.5 don&#39;t print from QuarkXPress 6; this was fixed in 4.6

  body: For the record, I wasn&#39;t talking about Type 1 fonts. I&#39;m presuming
    the font has a cmap table and that glyphs are mapped to character codes internally.
    In which case glyph names are largely irrelevant for modern software. Still, if
    you&#39;re going to include glyph names in the final font, then it makes sense
    for them to follow a standard naming system that is parseable, such as the afii
    names in the Adobe Glyph List.

  body: John, <BR>You&#39;re a wealth of information. So glad to have you on these
    boards. Is the renaming script pretty easy/self explanitory to use? Or are there
    instructions included in your zip files &#40;I&#39;m at work now, I&#39;ll hafta
    download later&#41;

  body: The renaming script is pretty easy to use. Download it from Adam&#39;s &#39;steroid&#39;
    site, install it, and run it from the FL macro menu &#40;obviously you&#39;ll
    need to have Python installed too&#41;. I should note that the script download
    includes some Tiro renaming files, but the Cyrillic versions I&#39;ve posted here
    are more recent versions with new Unicode characters.

  body: very cool. i had downloaded FL on steroids and tried running it last night.
    Adam T. is a genius! So for these newer renaming files i just hafta make sure
    i stick them in the right folder, and that&#39;s it?
