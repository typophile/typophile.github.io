  up soon. Most of you probably don't need it (it's super basic), but anyone who's
  interested is welcome.\r\n\r\nAll that entry requires is enrolling at <a href=\"http://www.ccsf.edu/Offices/Matriculation/step1.htm\">City
  College</a> and having some demonstrable command of B\xE9zier curves (like in Illustrator).\r\n\r\nEverything
  else we can take care of on the first day of class.\r\n\r\nGRPH 152 Digital Font
  Creation \r\nWednesdays: 6:00\u201310:00pm, Visual Arts 143\r\nCCSF Ocean Campus:
  50 Phelan Ave.\r\n8-week course: October 26\u2013December 14, 2005\r\nCRN 76938\r\n\r\nBTW,
