  esp. the built-in support in most for oldstyle numerals. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m doing
  up print collateral &#40;with mailing addresses, of course&#41; using oldstyle numerals.
  Zip&#43;4 codes look great with them; however, because a Street Address line usually
  starts with numbers, having the line start with characters &#40;34&#41; that hang
  below the baseline looks uneven. <BR> <BR>Is it acceptable to mix the two styles
  within a text block. I&#39;d love to be able to use lining numerals in the Street
  Address line and oldstyle characters in the City-State-Zip line, but I want to make
  sure I&#39;m not committing a typographic faux pas. <BR> <BR>Also, any great style
  guide books out there there that discuss typographic minutiae such as the above? '
