    the work of typedesigners. Asking here for a a free version of some font is like
    asking on Lady Gagas guestbook where you\u2019ll get her new album for free. \r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, it is always good to show a sample for what you are looking for. If
    you are looking for a font called \xBB<a href=\"http://www.acuplusembroidery.com/catalogs/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=4180&category_id=685&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=1\">AR
