Indeed, my comment shows my ignorance of the German terminology, which I find most interesting. <BR> <BR>Stephen: There are also probably 50&#43; Adobe type families with tabular oldstyle figures. Essentially any family that has oldstyle figures generally comes with both proportional and tabular ones. Most of the same families also have both proportional and tabular lining figures. <BR> <BR>Stephen again: You&#39;re right, &#34;ranging figures&#34; really is a synonym for &#34;oldstyle figures&#34; or &#34;text figures.&#34; <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Old style figures were the norm until around 1800, when they were almost wholly replaced by lining figures. <BR> <BR>When the historical revival occurred around 1900, old style figures again became available, but as a little used option, mainly for quality book publishing.  <BR> <BR>The &#34;definitive&#34; digital face, Licko&#39;s Matrix &#40;1985&#41; featured OSF as standard. This set the tone. <BR> <BR>Two FontFont faces, Scala and Meta, can also be credited with popularizing OSF again. <BR> <BR>When these faces were introduced c.1990, they had OSF as the standard figures, and Lining figures as the alternates.  <BR> <BR>This was a radical idea at the time &#40;for instance, Adobe and Monotype followed the standard practice of creating &#34;Expert&#34; fonts, which grouped Small Caps and Old Style Figures on an alternate font, often named &#34;SC/OSF&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>However, Matrix, Scala and Meta did not take the next step, which was to also make the OS figures tabular. <BR> <BR>I reason that if one is designing a typeface from scratch today, it makes sense to have the standard figures as tabular, and oldstyle. This is what I have done with many of my designs -- Oneleigh, Merlin, Fontesque Sans, Bodoni Egyptian, Preface.  <BR> <BR>An exception to the trend towards OSF seems to be for newspaper fonts, where OSF tends to look too &#34;bookish&#34;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Old style figures were the norm until around 1800, when they were almost wholly replaced by lining figures. <BR> <BR>Nick, would you say that&#39;s true generally, or are you mainly speaking of the US &amp; Canada? <BR>I have no study or research to go on, but my impression was that OSFs were popular right through the C19, going out of fashion slowly over thre first few decades of the C20. This impression was formed largely through UK material, so it could be a &#39;local&#39; thing. &#40;It could just as easily be a false impression, though a quick - and unrepresentative - look around the stuff in my house shows hardly any lining figs on C19 items, becoming more frequent up to the 40s, then hardly any OSF in the 50s, and none after that until recent years&#41;. <BR> <BR>The exception to this is documentation &#40;as opposed to books,adverts etc&#41; - lining figures throughout.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Steve, I hope I haven&#39;t got this backwards. It&#39;s my understanding that text faces of the 19th century in most western countries were mainly moderns, which had lining figures. <BR> <BR>However, there&#39;s no way to prove this without statistical analysis!  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m assuming that the popularity of OSF is related to the popularity of old style faces. <BR> <BR>So when the moderns, scotches, and romans of the 19th century held sway, this drastically reduced the amount of OSF in use. <BR> <BR>For the 20th century, Linotype setups that were &#34;Typeface &#43; Italic &#43; small caps&#34; only occasionally had OSF &#40;even for old style faces&#41;, so I believe that this resulted in a lack of OSF during the Linotype era.  <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gerald, <BR> <BR>Yes, it&#39;s OK now, but back in the early 1990s, when one bought a typeface like Adobe Garamond or Palatino, the Regular Roman had lining figures, and there was also an &#34;Expert&#34; font that had a &#34;standard&#34; of Uppercase, Small Caps, Old Style Figures.  <BR> <BR>So, if one had a long piece of text in those problem typefaces, where one wanted to use OSF, one had to change fonts every time a figure was used.  <BR> <BR>Also, if one wanted to set &#34;Caps with Small Caps&#34; in Adobe Garamond, one had to change fonts for every Cap! <BR> <BR>So obviously Emigre and FontFont had a much better idea, first by making the OSF the standard figures for the roman U&amp;lc font. <BR> <BR>However, there were also introduced in the early nineties Linotype fonts such as Electra, that had alternate U&amp;lc fonts, both &#34;Regular&#34; &#40;with lining figures&#41; and &#34;OSF&#34;. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, I was annoyed to find recently that the majority of people use ranging as a synonym for lining, when I&#39;d been using it as a synonym for &#39;oldstyle&#39; figures. I still think the latter makes much more sense: the figures don&#39;t stay coralled in a fixed height, they range like cattle on the wide open prairie of the extender length. <BR> <BR>Another term for oldstyle figures is &#39;hanging&#39;, although this isn&#39;t very satisfactory as only some of them typically hang &#40;3 4 5 7 9&#41;, others sit &#40;0 1 2&#41;, and others stand &#40;6 8&#41; -- ignoring for now that fact that some French figures are more upstanding than their cousins in other nations. <BR> <BR>How about &#39;extending figures&#39;?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rodolfo, Grazia Bodoni is shown in Allan Haley&#39;s <i>Hot Designers Make Cool Fonts.</i> The numerals follow the traditional OsF pattern. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if Bodoni was consistent with the standing 3 and 5 in all of his fonts. The <i>Manuale Tipografico</i> does not generally show figures with the specimens for each size. Also, I have not done an exhaustive search of the work. But the numerals within the introduction are all &#34;French style.&#34; Same with the page numbers and the index and the numbers identifying his catalog of ornaments. And there are two pages toward the end which show large numerals &#40;I can&#39;t tell what size, but display sizes&#41; which have a standing 3, 5, <i>and</i> 7, but short 0, 1, and 2, and a hanging 9. <BR> <BR>Looking quickly through Updike, I notice that the Romain du Roi &#40;as cut by Grandjean, c. 1700&#41; appears to have had the standard pattern of OsF. Same with Luce&#39;s fonts &#40;c. 1770s&#41;. The standing 3 and 5 show up with the Didots &#40;c. 1780s&#41;. <BR> <BR>However, I notice at least one instance of Baskerville cutting a standing 3 and 5! In figure 272 &#40;Vol. II, opposite pg. 115&#41;, a notice of sale of some of Baskerville&#39;s types in Paris, c. 1789, &#40;set, of course, in one of Baskerville&#39;s fonts&#41; shows a standing 3 and 5.  <BR> <BR>The standing 3 is also seen in figure 165 &#40;Vol I&#41;, which is an example of Voltaire&#39;s <i>La Pucelle</i> printed in France in 1789 using one of Baskerville&#39;s types.    <BR> <BR>Baskerville died in 1775. So, it seems conceivable to me that the &#34;French style&#34; of OsF may, in fact, have originated in a Baskerville experiment. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR></div>
