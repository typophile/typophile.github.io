body: OK, I will post this in a new thread. <BR>What is the font that they use for
  the actual words &#34;New York Times&#34; and &#34;Los Angeles Times.&#34;  It is
  a very ornate font with lots of extra lines that appears on every page in a smaller
  version.  Is there even a font like that? <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: It&#39;s a style called blackletter. As discussed in a <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12667.html?1057969179">previous
    thread</a>, the New York Times nameplate appears to be a custom job &#40;or at
    least a blackletter variation that never made it into digital that we could find&#41;,
    and so does the Los Angeles Times nameplate. Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=blackletter">a
    list of various blackletter faces available on MyFonts</a>.

    was less than two weeks ago...  <BR> <BR>I would assume the L.A. Times is hand
    drawn as well.
