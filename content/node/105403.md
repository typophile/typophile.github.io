  body: "Looks too consistent for hand engraving.\r\nBracelets, rings etc are usually
    engraved with a milling machine that uses fonts in a special format.\r\nSome of
    these have the same names as regular fonts.\r\nOthers do not.\r\nI believe this
    one is in the latter category and is usually sold as \"Roman.\"\r\nHere is a link
    to a typical list of engraving fonts:\r\nhttp://www.jewelryimpressions.com/fonts.html\r\nThere
    are a few variations in \"Roman\" among engravers, but they usually are pretty
    close to your bracelet.\r\nDon"

  body: "\"Roman\" is a works well for engraving because it usually uses hairline
    terminations rather than ball terminals. Plus it has wide curves -- note for example
    the open J.\r\nDon"
