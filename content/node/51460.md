  body: "This is Trajan - it's just been 'modified' by the 'designer' who thought
    the S would look better wider. It doesn't of course, because it now looks bolder
    than the other characters due to the horizontal scaling. Same goes for the F.
    It also seems to be emboldened with the arms of the E's extended.\r\n\r\nNot a
    great 'improvement'.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: Thank you! I didn't spot the modification, sort of hoped to find it as a font.
    On the other hand, the company's official font is Arial, so I shouldn't be surprised.
