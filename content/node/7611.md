  however, here goes: can anyone positively identify the typeface Saul Bass used for
  the title sequence for <i>Psycho</i>? Here are a <a href="http://www.mattsoar.org/psycho/Psycho.jpg">couple
  of samples</a>. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance to one and all, <BR> <BR>Matt S.'

    target="_blank">News Gothic</a> is a bit closer for the top one. Compare the C
    and S.

    target="_blank">Nimbus Sans</a> Bold Extended be a better match for the bottom
    sample? Strangely, Nimbus&#39;s daddy, Helvetica, is much farther away.

  body: 'From the book <a href="http://www.marionboyars.co.uk/Specific%20title%20pages/hitch.html"
    target=_top>Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho</a>, by Stephen Rebello.
    <BR> <BR><i>Postproduction <BR>Adler, who previously had worked with Bass on the
    title sequences of Vertigo and North by Northwest before tackling Psycho, explained
    how it was done: .... I did the title, Psycho, in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=SG.102143.0.4&amp;charSize=14&amp;sampleText=PSYCHO&amp;sampleSize=48"
    target=_top>Venus Bold Extended</a> and got two reverse photostats made....  For
    the other big titles, like &#39;Directed by Alfred Hitchcock&#39;, I used News
    Gothic Bold typeface and we did the same three-cut technique as for the title
    of the movie.</i> <BR> <BR>The thing is that the S and the C of PSYCHO don&#39;t
    match with the Venus Bold Extended, they are closer in the shapes to the Extrabold
    weight though. <BR>Did they modify the S and C they had? <BR>Different cut of
    Venus from another foundry? <BR>A little lack of memory by Adler? <BR>Is it the
    Psycho Week?'
