    this evening before it was answered here. I found a font called Stymie Black Italic
    Flair that matches in some ways but not others. I concluded that it was probably
    a knock-off of something by P-L when I saw West Behemoth Ital in one of my P-L
    books. Then I check here and see that Grant&#39;s got the exact thing in one of
    his books &#40;none of mine have it&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Well done, Grant.

    <BR>That&#39;s a typical Photo-Lettering name. The names they assigned were almost
    like the Latin names for plants and animals. They often tell the name of the designer
    and other facts. &#34;West&#34; actually refers to the designer in this case.
