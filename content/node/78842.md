body: "Hey guys. I'm trying to find a great industrial-looking sans-serif font, much
  to the feel of Futura when done in all/small caps.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe problem
  is my version of Futura adds quite a bit of weight to the caps compared to the small
  caps, and throws off the delicate balance I'm looking for. I'd love something with
  a bit more consistency between the weight of the full caps and the small caps, and
  that looks great tracked out pretty openly, but still reads well at small sizes.
  It will be used surrounding the outer edge of a circle logo element in what looks
  very much like an old service logo from the 50s.\r\n\r\nThanks ahead of time."

    caps, for good reasons, but Underground comes with an extra set of them. There
    might be a cut of Futura out there tuned more towards German with lighter capitals.
    I\u2019m sure someone with more knowledge will chime in."
