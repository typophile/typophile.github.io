body: I need to re-create this old logo and need to know the fonts used. Is the &#34;E&#34;
  a custom design? Is the whole word &#34;Essolub&#34; custom? If someone happens
  to have a better photo/scan of the logo I would be very interested... <BR> <BR><img

  body: It&#39;s probably a custom type design, but I think you can simulate it easily
    by using a backwards 3 for the E. I did this sample with Quay Sans Black, which
    is maybe not the best font match for the s and u, but it gives the idea &#40;the
    3 was the right sort of shape&#41;.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22398.gif"

  body: 'I am continually surprised at how often people assume that some old piece
    of lettering is type. Old advertising art like that is most likely not type, even
    if it was mass-produced, and even when it looks like it could be type &#40;i.e.,
    nothing particularly irregular about the letterforms or their treatment&#41;.
    Doing it by hand was the only way back then to have the kind of flexibility and
    control over the design that we take for granted today. '

    enough &#40;my bad english!&#41;. I was thinking that the logo was handpainted,
    but because I need reproduce the logo a typeface as close as possible would be
    a good starting point. It&#39;s also a personal project just for fun, so the result
    don&#39;t have to be 100% exact. <BR> <BR>Mike, I have found many typefaces with
    the right &#34;3&#34;, but not yet found a match where both the &#34;3&#34; and
    the rest match. I&#39;ll propably have to use two typefaces. Any good suggestions
    for the &#34;ssolub&#34;-part?'

  body: Of course Mark is right, and so I assumed that what you wanted to do was match
    the lettering, not find the &#39;font&#39;.  I looked at a number of sans serif
    fonts, and had trouble finding one that had everything. Futura has the right &#39;s&#39;,
    but its &#39;u&#39; has no stem; the &#39;b&#39; from Quay Sans Black was fine,
    but the &#39;u&#39; isn&#39;t quite right.  If I were going to replicate this
    I would use the 3, o, l and b from Quay Sans Black &#40;above&#41;, and use the
    s from Futura Heavy and modify the Futura u by adding a stem.  &#40;see attached
    version done that way, with some adjustments to size, tracking, and using the
    Futura&#39;l&#39; for the l and stem of the &#39;b&#39;.&#41; If that&#39;s too
    much work I&#39;d stay with the Quay Sans version I did above. It would probably
    be close enough if you weren&#39;t comparing them side-by-side. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22486.gif"

  body: Mike, the combination Quay Sans Black and Futura Heavy looks close enough.
    Thank you very much for your efforts!

  body: Good idea Yves. By the way, Jan, I think I ended up using Futura Bold, rather
    than Heavy. You will need do do some tweaking, as I said, but my re-creation took
    about 15 - 20 minutes to do. I could have played with outlines to make some things
    closer, and it would have been more efficient to flip the n to make the u.
