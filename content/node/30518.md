  a book which will be set with the new type. Not exactly an ideal situation for everyone,
  but I find it a good excuse to finish the type face I've been working on for quite
  some time. Anyway, I have a couple of questions (more will follow in later posts).\r\nThe
  book includes ONE Greek word, and this will sound pretty lame, but could anyone
  identify the actual letters? The only version the publisher have is of an earlier
  printed edition. If You yourselves have a copy of J\xFCngers <em>Ann\xE4herungen:
  Drogen und Rausch</em> You could perhaps have a better version.\r\n\r\nMy guess
  is an italic version of <em> Nu, Alpha, Rho, Chi, Sigma</em> and<em> Omega</em>.
  But that's the ultimate amateur's guess I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n\u0192\r\n\r\n"

    word as\r\n\u2018\u03BD\u03B1\u03C1\u03C7\u03C3\u03C9\u2019 in classical Greek.
    I think You should type \u2018\u03BD\u03B1\u03C1\u03BA\u03CC\u03C9\u2019\r\ninstead.
    That would mean \u2018jag bed\xF6var\u2019 or \u2018benumb\u2019, \u2018deaden\u2019\r\nin
    English.\r\nThe false (top) and correct (below) forms have been presented\r\nin
    an attached image.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nPetri L.\r\n\r\nP. S.\r\nThe typeface
    used here is the original \u2018Monotype Porson\u2019.\r\nA free version, named
    \u2018GSF Olga\u2019, can be obtained here:\r\nhttp://www.greekfontsociety.org/pages/en_typefaces.html\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/benumb_6109.jpg]"

    original (released in the '70s) Swedish edition. Oh, well... \r\n\r\nI'll be back
    when I have further questions regarding my own version. I hope You can set me
