  intolerable, please head to another thread. Thank you, kindly. <BR> <BR>For those
  who&#39;ve stayed, some virtual latte and croissants are on the sideboard for your
  enjoyment. <BR> <BR>Gigantacorp has just made the leap to both Quark 6 and OX 10
  &#40;from Quark 4.4 and OS 9&#41; and we are experiencing a frightening amount of
  glitches. <BR> <BR>The main one is disappearing type when updating Quark 4 files
  to Quark 6.  <BR> <BR>Before I bore you with details, I&#39;m curious whether anyone
  else has had this problem. All the type in text boxes will jump as if it overflows
  &#40;with little red warning box&#41; and thereafter be completely inaccessible.
  <BR> <BR>We have a work-around for this, but I was hoping some type wonk could tell
  me what the heck is causing this and/or their own work arounds. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: Kristin, the problem is you are still using that disaster &#40;Quark&#41;.
    Save yourself and switch to InDesign CS, your Quark 4 files will translate and
    you&#39;ll discover something called typography.

    sorry for the users who are stuck with it, particularly when it wasn&#39;t their
    decision. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I&#39;m still jazzed from hearing about
    the recent InDesign switch party thrown by a major NYC publisher -- they were
    so excited about it that they rented Madison Square Gardens. Really. We didn&#39;t
    even put them up to it or anything, although I gather they invited some Adobe
    folks. <BR> <BR>Good luck with it, Kristen. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Kristen, <BR>Once upon a time, I was the greatest Quark zealot ever known.  After
    being shafted by them over many years, I have come to the opinion that their corporate
    stupidity is so ingrained that they can never change.  I would be willing to bet
    that they will vanish as a company within 2 years.  Maybe a developer who cares
    might buy XPress from them and make it good again but don&#39;t hold your breath.  Your
    client will have to switch sooner or later.  Until then, throw away 6 and go back
    to 4.11.  You can ride 4.11 through Quark&#39;s stay in the Hospice.  I bought
    the upgrade to 6 &#40;like a fool&#41; and have since dumped it in favor of InDesign
    when I can and Xpress 4.11 when I must. <BR> <BR>My condolences, <BR> <BR>Chris

  body: 'Hi Tiffany! Good to see you and thanks for the links. <BR> <BR>Thanks to
    the rest for your sympathy &#40;and your use of the idiom is correct, Yves!&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>The corp did consider InDesign and got lots of pressure from below to make
    the switch. Oddly enough, and as a huge surprise to our tech team, Quark actually
    sent a rep to headquarters to answer questions and push the upgrade.  <BR> <BR>The
    work around for the type problem is to work off-network, open the Quark 4 file
    and view each and every page &#40;including master pages&#41;, THEN save the file,
    thus transforming the document to a Quark 6 file. Anything else will force the
    type outside the text boxes and into some kind of Twilight Zone. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    fascinated that the act of viewing a page will save the type. It&#39;s as if each
    Quark 4 page wants me to say a personal goodbye before it gets absorbed into the
    Quark 6 &#40;aka Borg&#41; universe. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s the kind of problem that
    would be fun to track down if I had tons of time and didn&#39;t have circulars
    and print ads and posters and brochures to produce on a deadline. <BR> <BR>I just
    can&#39;t imagine why displaying a document page on a computer screen somehow
    prevents the bug. For ex: we tried viewing different pages of a multiple page
    document and saving it in Quark 6. Each time, whichever page or pages we had not
    displayed was/were corrupted.  <BR> <BR>Does that stir any ideas among the more
    technically inclined typophiles? I&#39;m mystified. <BR> <BR>'

  body: I&#39;m using Quark 6 on Jaguar, and I haven&#39;t run into any bugs. I have
    come to the conclusion that the only reason there&#39;s such a thing as 6 is that
    they needed something to run on OSX... I haven&#39;t noticed any interesting differences.
    But then, I&#39;m more of an Illustrator man.

    was solved by increasing the font cache size. <BR> <BR>BTW, I have been using
    InDesign for a couple of years, and still have not reached the level of skill
    which I have with Quark. Maybe I&#39;m just hopelessly &#34;hard-wired&#34; to
    Quark, but I still have to look hard at the Character and Paragraph palettes in
    InDesign and think about what the little icons mean. <BR> <BR>I have the same
    problem with all the pretty &#34;icons&#34; in OS X, which all look the same,
    particularly so for Adobe CS. <BR> <BR>It drives me up the &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;

    and John B. says that he runs it fine in Jaguar as well. <BR> <BR>I wonder whether
    it&#39;s related to the OS, or QX 6&#39;s relationship to the OS. We&#39;re considering
    moving to QX 6 from QX 4 in a now-Jaguar, soon-to-be-Panther environment. <BR>
    <BR>Personally, I&#39;d rather have Panther than QX 6...

    He found that the ironic workaround was to convert his documents from Quark 4
    to InDesign and then back to Quark 6 via a 3rd party plugin. Sad and laughable.
    If I remember the name of the plugin I&#39;ll post it.
