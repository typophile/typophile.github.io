  Hire. They are wanting the brand to be stylish and classy. I am looking for a font
  that would capture this idea, and was hoping to get some suggestions, the client
  has a small budget so I wont be able to spend big mony on fonts.\r\n\r\nBelow is
  some added info of the services the company offers\r\n \r\nSo basically the business
  offers 3 services:\r\n \r\n1: Promotional services - The best promotional models
  available to promote maximum impact for any event.\r\n2: Luxury Vehicle Hire - Top
  of the range vehicles to transport you in true star style to any event. \r\n3. Party
  Vehicle Hire - The most beautiful models available to host you and your party in

    what does big money mean in this context? You don\u2019t need a big type system
    for a logo, but just one or two font styles.\r\n\r\nIt is contradictory to provide
    a luxury service, but not to have a few Dollars for one or two font styles."

    not mine, any suggestions?
