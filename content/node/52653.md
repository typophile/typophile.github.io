  for an upcoming book project (my first 'serious' book actually!), and got pretty
  excited about them offering different <em>grades</em> to offset differences between
  paper / printing circumstances. \r\n\r\nNow to my uninformed eye, <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_features.php?featureID=1&productLineID=100017\">the
  difference between the grades</a> looks very similar to the difference between optical
  sizes in other typefaces, except that the different grades all share common widths
  / metrics so as to be interchangeable at any time. \u2013 Also, on <a href=\"http://typography.com/ask/recentTopic.php?rtID=89\">the
  H&FJ page that helps in choosing a grade</a>, under the <em>Book</em> section it
  says, <em>\"Book designers who use uncoated stock (and can rely on good inking)
  typically select Grade Two. Those who routinely run very small type, such as footnotes
  or captions, should consider adding Grade Three.\"</em>\r\n\r\nNow \u2013 wouldn't
  that effectively mean using the heavier grade in the function of a smaller optical
  size?\r\n\r\nSo, can 'grades' indeed be seen as sort of an elegant digital adaptation,
  or expansion, of the concept of optical sizes \u2013 as in, you need a smaller size,
  you choose a heavier grade (& most likely track it more loosely) \u2013 but also,
  if you need the same size but the print comes out too light, you can choose a heavier
  grade as well without the layout changing?\r\nOr am I mixing up apples and oranges?\r\n\r\n(If
  this sounds confused, it's probably because I am. :) )"

  body: '"Grade" probably means something a little different to each foundry, so I''ll
    let H&FJ respond for their fonts specifically, but my understanding is that each
    <em>grade</em> differs more or less only in weight, whereas each <em>[[optical
    size]]</em> is a comprehensive redesign of each letterform, from x-height and
    width to contrast, serif size, and other details.'

  body: "Thanks for the reply Stephen. I didn't realize the 'grades' don't have a
    universally accepted definition \u2026 interesting.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm seeing stuff
    that's not there, but the reason for my confusion is that with Mercury, the heavier
    grades seem to look 'sturdier' in much the same way as smaller optical sizes sometimes
    do (bigger serifs, less detail, less contrast); this is a direct comparison between
    grade 1 and 4 (taken from their <a href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_features.php?featureID=1&productLineID=100017\">overview
    image</a>):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mercury1_4_6208.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    will contact H&FJ with this question directly, I wonder what they will say. I'm
    pretty thrilled about the concept :)"

  body: Please do ask, and bring post their answer here. My guess is still that varying
    grades generally represent a change in weight without a change in width or height.

  body: "I think you had it perfectly right in your first post, no confusion at all
    ;)\r\n\r\nRe. the changes in contrast and robustness: You can think of grade four
    in your example as grade one plus \"built-in\" ink spread. Because ink spread
    adds a fixed amount of weight to every line (hairlines and stems alike), the consequence
    is, as you noted, lowered contrast and a sturdier look.\r\n\r\nFor example, if
    your hairlines are 40 units wide and the stems 120 units, you've got a contrast
    ratio of 1:3. If you add an ink spread of 10 units to each contour, hairlines
    are then 60 units wide (10 + 40 + 10) and stems are 140 units wide, thus the contrast
    ratio has been lowered to 1:2.33.\r\n\r\nThis change in weight is different from
    the way you usually change a letter's weight when making a bold weight from a
    regular one, where you would change the letter's proportions (baseline, cap height
    and x-height (mostly) stay the same), and change the contrast in the other direction
    (keep hairline width, make stems wider so the contrast is effectively raised)."

  body: "Thanks for the input Jens \u2013 this clears up a lot.\r\n\r\nI think I'm
    finally getting the idea now, ha. So if I use uncoated paper, and a lighter grade,
    that plus the ink spread that happens from the paper is going to look approximately
    the same as using a heavier grade on a coated (or less rough) paper? :) \r\nNeat.
    I'll still drop H&FJ an email to ask about the overlap with optical sizes, though.
    This might be an exciting 'double function' \u2026"

    to weight exclusively, and predominantly to deal with issues at the press, or
    today, on screens. This was initially accomplished for Playboy in 1990 to account
    for the difference between offset and gravure printing and then was applied more
    generally to similar issues in the printing of newspapers by 1995.\r\n\r\n\"...you
    need a smaller size, you choose a heavier grade (& most likely track it more loosely)\"\r\nYou
    can use them this way assuming you do not have a complex typographical hierarchy
    depending on matching metrics across grades, and you can find suitably graded
    bold and italics for your use. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    definitely keep my eyes peeled for this. The concept sure is enticing!
