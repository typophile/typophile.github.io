  I've decided to rehabilitate it by kerning therapy, which is something I needed
  practice in anyway. I'm quite pleased with the results, although I don't plan on
  doing it old-school (2054 individual pairs IIRC) ever again.\r\n\r\nI'm sure it
  isn't legitimate to post the resulting font, but (assuming interest) is it OK to
  post the AFM?\r\n"

    that went to different locations in a laserdisc without the permission of the
    copyright holder of the movie therein.

    font is probably entirely fine. But I'm not a lawyer. Which is fine by me because
    they make boring fonts.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Leaving aside the issue of how something can be both new and improved at
    the same time, I can verify that this kerning is \"new,\" but \"improved\" is
    open to debate. ;^)\r\n\r\nThe shapes and spirits of the letters (err, the letter
    and spirit of the shapes?) lend themselves to some unusual kerning possibilities.
    For example, the rightmost legs of R and K dip well below the baseline, whimsically
    inviting letters to perch above them. A touch of whimsy suits the face -- and
    really, it's no different in theory from tucking letters beneath the eaves of
    a T.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll contact Microsoft to get official word on what I can
    do. With lawyers, permission is generally easier (and cheaper!) than forgiveness.\r\n"

    touching the font."

  body: "As far as I can tell, distributing a kerning file doesn't violate the license,
    so I'm releasing the AFM file, which FontLab and IIRC FontForge allow you to use
    directly, even though the font is TT. (Cool, hunh?) The font itself only says
    it's from Microsoft, whose typography group pointed me to Monotype, who haven't
    bothered to get back to me. I make no claim to ownership of the font, use at your
    own risk, yadda yadda, I'm not responsible for anything you may do with this,
    up to and including imploding the Solar System by using it.\r\n\r\nMy understanding
    is that it's legal to distribute the kerning file, and I'll cease, desist, halt,
    all that good stuff if this is unethical or illegal.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you
    agree to all of the above terms, here's the link: http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?ye26f6zix8uxm8u\r\n\r\nI
    chose to expand the kerning to individual kerning to ensure maximal compatibility
    across platforms; and there are a godawful lot of unlikely pairs, just in case
    any Martians want to use it."
