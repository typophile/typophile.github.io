body: "Hi\r\nI'm looking for a serif typeface suitable for logo use. Typefaces like
  bembo and garamond don't look good for this purpose. when they are set too big,
  they loose their beauty. I've played around with palatino for a while, and i really
  like its \"sculptural\" qualities. The only thing is, it's a bit overused. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nAnd
  by the way, the logo is for a industrial design company.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nalex"

  body: If you want something that looks elegant when large, you should consider something
    with a Display variation (characterized by high contrast, and delicate features),
    but this isn't always best for a logo, which is often seen at under an inch. Is
    that true for this logo?

  body: "Stephen,\r\nthis logo will be seen at sizes up to 20x10 cm, i think, but
    it should work larger as well. You never know when they'll invest in proper signage:-)
    What i experienced when using body text fonts on this, is that  from a certain
    size, they just look like body text fonts set too big.\r\n\r\nalex\r\n.........................................................\r\n<a
