  the word \"weights\" in the strict sense of differing stroke thickness with the

  to using the term \"weights\" to mean what I would call \"styles\" or \"fonts.\"
  Italics or a separate small caps font do not comprise additional weights!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "This relates to a discussion on the W3C \"style\" list (CSS discussions,
    including web fonts). I'm watching quite a few things, trying to make sure that
    specifying fonts in CSS works as well as possible, with an eye to the day when
    one might be able to use a much wider variety of fonts (web fonts).\r\n\r\nBasically
    CSS only allows a font family to have nine distinct weights (like the original
    Apple TrueType spec, I think). Folks at the W3C are questioning the need for allowing
    more than nine weights in a font family.\r\n\r\nBut Microsoft changed that scale
    (pre-OpenType, in their TrueType spec, in the OS/2 table) by multiplying it by
    100, and the only plausible reason for that would seem to be to allow finer gradations
    of weight.\r\n\r\nI think I'm coming to the realization that this is just another
    of the many compromises made in CSS font handling. Only a few families would be
    affected by this one. I suspect it would have to be much more badly broken for
    the W3C to consider changing it... I'll probably go find some other CSS fonts

    avoid making the same mistakes again. It woud have been possible to keep multiple
    master tech in OpenType, but it would essentially have doubled the evangelism
    required, and made success that much less sure.\r\n\r\nI don't know that it multiple
    master tech was too complicated for graphic designers to understand, but it was
    certainly complicated, and it would have required a major effort to educate and
    evangelize. The relevant people didn't realize that, or chose not to do it. Instead,
    MM fonts just had their prices reduced in an effort to boost sales. All that happened
    was that lots of people bought MMs but didn't even know they had them, or what
    was special about them.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, folks at Adobe learned from what
    happened and worked pretty hard to evangelize OpenType, both internally and externally.
    Arguably some of the problems solved by OpenType were more important, but I'm
    pretty sure that the difference in evangelism efforts made a huge difference in
