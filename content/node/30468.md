  uses Neuzeit S in their logos and titles. I need to pair it with a pertinent body
  text font. The previous design firm chose Times New Roman due to accessibility and
  availability in word documents, website default, etc. I want to change it, so I'm
  just wondering what you guys think about the use of a serif VS a san serif font.
  Also, any suggestions on what might go well with Neuzeit S.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    it is good.\u201D You need enough difference between the grotesques and it\u2019s
    all good.\r\n\r\nFor serif, almost anything goes. Since it\u2019s a book, I don\u2019t
    think the geometry of Neuzeit is very good (for body text I mean). But whatever
    you choose, please no ITC Garamond, Stone or Rotis. I\u2019ve had enough of those
    in marketing books. ;^)"

    companions for geometric sans-serifs. Many designers find these to be straining
    on the eye when used in long texts, however.\r\n\r\nNeuzeit S has the small aperture
    and similar body structure to Realist types like Clarendon, Century, Century Schoolbook,
    and the like, so these might be possibilities as well.\r\n\r\nDavid Thometz"

  body: thanks for the help guys. i'm going to look through these font suggestions.
    i want to find an ideal balance between how the font signifies the company ideals
    (they want to spin themselves as the "new" architects, progressive) and its utility.
