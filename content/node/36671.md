body: "There's a boutique at the mall that carries frightfully expensive clothes but
  has a sign with a tiger-man and \"MATT LEINES\" printed on it in a gorgeous typeface.
  I can't find my original drawing of the typeface, but the drawing I've included
  comes pretty close, it captures the essence of it anyway. Tell me if you've got
  an idea what the face may be, or if there's something similar that is equally gorgeous.
  By the way, Matt Leines is the the artist that drew the tiger-man, and he's quite
  good. http://swindlemagazine.com/issue11/matt-leines/\r\nSincelery,\r\nRyan\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mat_3605.jpg]"

  body: Those are some pretty faces, thank you, sir. In fact, those precise faces
    have been suggested to me in my blog as examples of Victorian era types. However,
    they aren't a match, I'm looking for something that's almost the same as my drawing.

  body: By Joe, Nick! I think you must be right! That's a terrific typeface. But I
    did see one that was really skinny like my drawing in Tabula Rasa one time,(another
    store that is egregiously priced, but o so pretty) and I think I may have translated
    that into my drawing. I will take a picture of it the next time I'm in there and
    show you, because it's lovely too.

  body: "Quite nice these faces.\r\nIn fact your design is more beautiful than the
    typeface below.\r\nMaybe also because its more irregular. And maybe it has less
    contrast in lines.\r\nSo why not design by yourself?\r\nNice.\r\n\r\nStefan\r\n\r\nPS
    I am a lover of Bodoni \r\nYou\u2019d have to see the origninals that he casted
    as ornament charcters in Bodoni museum, Parma.\r\nImportant to visit anyhow"
