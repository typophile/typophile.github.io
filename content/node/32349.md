    Pro Opticals</a>?

  body: Cheap? Cronos? Perhaps you just like rigidity over fluidity?

  body: Perhaps... I'm not sure about the softer edge to it. My version is Cronos
    Pro - no opticals after it. Is is the same?

    it is a clean look with nice contrasts, and since both fonts have many weights,
    it is very flexible.\r\n\r\n-M"

  body: "Hi Douglas,\r\n\r\nI see you have posted your message on a number of threads
    related to the pairing of typefaces now.\r\nAll of these threads are years old,
    hence your comment probably won\u2019t help the original posters. Bumping such
    old threads with the same old self-promotion can be perceived as spamming. My
    advice for you: start a new thread where you can explain your app and have it
    discussed by others, and then give it a rest.\r\n\r\nFlorian"

  body: "Wow. I had no idea the threads would be bumped like that. I thought the original
    posters would get a message, but that's it. Sorry! Intentionally bumping is always
    bad manners. Thanks for the heads up - won't happen again!\r\n\r\nI guess it's
    a credit to typophile.com that the forum sub-pages look like blog entries and
    not like a forum at all - not even remotely. Since I came in through google directly
    to these pages, I never saw the forum listing."
