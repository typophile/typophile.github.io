  the shoulder of the first, and there\u2019s a tiny bit of a curve there? In most
  faces this would be straight all the way up but I can\u2019t really do that here.
  I can\u2019t decide if it looks hideous and amateurish or if it\u2019s a cute little
  quirk.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/m_4074.png]"

  body: "I had a similar 'problem' a while back. I didn't like how my second 'hump'
    joined the first one. So I decided to take this route:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mmmm_5563.png]\r\n\r\ni.e.
    making the first 'hump' without a smooth curve like the right one, so that it
    joins more naturally. Maybe you can try something similar?"

  body: "I wonder if just giving a little more curve to the \"straight\" parts of
    the hump might help. As it is, with the way it intersects with the first hump,
    optically the curve almost turns inside out and looks like an S-curve coming out
    of the top of the first hump. \r\n\r\nOf course, what the other letters look like
    will establish how much this will stick out. Your h and m humps look (for lack
    of a better term) a bit architectural (like [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=tekton&x=0&y=0|Tekton]]
    etc.), but your a has round curves that are quite different. If the smoother and
    more symmetrical curve at the top of the a is part of this font's aesthetic, one
    might be left wondering why the same curve wasn't used to make more conformist
    humps in the other letters."

  body: Craig, I think it does come down to why the n looks like that in the first
    place. And now that I think about it, the letters I have that really work are
    the ones with the soft curves. Back to the drawing board, I guess!

    letters? Thw \"a\" for example looks foreign to it. Work with both the top of
    the a and n until you find a solution that can be used for all similar cases.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
