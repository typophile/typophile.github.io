  has been asked a million times... but let's try again.\r\n.\r\nI want to acquire
  a version of this font that is as clean as this example. I have Aktuelle, but it
  is not clean like this.\r\n.\r\nHow about Opti Sport or Spoleto? Are either of those
  as clean as this example?"

    above example is from Aktuelle, and I think there are some clear differences in
    the quality, when compared to the example in my first post.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I'm
    just trippin. But to me, this Aktuelle looks like a scan of a scan of a live trace
    of a scan of a xerox copy of a... well, you get the idea."

    I must admit to being very particular about the style I want. For my taste, Fenway
    Park has too many parallel lines and a bit much contrast. And many of the caps
    don't work for me.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's time to get busy in FontLab."

    and narrowed version of Opti Sport.\r\n\r\nAnd so this raises the question of
    whether Opti Sport would also leave me disappointed."

    Novel Fonts that was used for the sample that Jan posted. I don't know that I
    can re-create the forensic view done by Bob. If you have limited typesetting you
    need, I would be glad to set some for you as a courtesy. E-mail me what you need
