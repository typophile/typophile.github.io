  body: "I can tell you, ever since I discovered [[Psy/Ops]] it has become one of
    my favourite \"boutique\" foundries, as it boasts an excellent and coherent collection
    of designs -- very high-class type, very modern without it being too \"in your
    face\", and very reasonably priced. Purr-fect.\r\n\r\nSo far I've licensed --
    in chronological order -- Oxtail, the Sophisto Superset, Armchair Modern and Eidetic
    Neo, and they're just too good to be true. Plus you get a free font for every
    US$ 100 you purchase, now <em>that</em> is a sweet deal! :-)"
