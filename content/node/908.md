body: So, just this past weekend I was able to go through my TypeCon2003 goodie bag
  and came upon Interrobang. Left me longing for a bit more of it... what&#39;s the
  deal SoTAphyles? Are we gonna see more of it? Bigger and badder? Leaner and cleaner?
  <BR> <BR>I like what you have done with it so far. I would love to hear all the
  perils of getting it published.

  body: 'google gave me this, I am not sure if it&#39;s what this is about, but thought
    it was interesting enough to post. <BR> <BR> <BR>The INTERROBANG: A twentieth
    century punctuation mark. <BR> <BR> <BR>The INTERROBANG has been described as
    &#34;an obscure punctuation mark.&#34; The purpose of this page is to move the
    INTERROBANG from the obscure to the ubiquitous.  <BR> <BR>A SHORT HISTORY <BR>
    <BR>As an advocate of precision in communication, the concept of the INTERROBANG
    was introduced by Martin K. Speckter in 1962 in an article written for TYPEtalks
    Magazine.&#42;  <BR> <BR>The INTERROBANG was created to fill a gap in our punctuation
    system where writers often used typographically cumbersome and unattractive combinations
    of the question mark and exclamation mark to punctuate rhetorical statements where
    neither the question nor an exclamation alone exactly served the writer. &#40;HOW
    ABOUT THAT?!&#41;  <BR> <BR>Mr. Speckter called his mark INTERROBANG from the
    Latin for query and the proofreader&#39;s term for exclamation. Most dictionaries
    have spelled the word correctly, although several other spellings with no logical
    genesis have appeared.  <BR> <BR>At the time the INTERROBANG was introduced in
    1962, a number of graphic designs were sent to the magazine from many sources.
    An example from this outpouring is shown above. Many newspapers and magazines
    and talk shows reported on the new mark. In an April, 1962 editorial, The Wall
    Street Journal deemed this punctuation exactly right for &#34;&#39;Who forgot
    to put gas in the car?&#39; where the question mark alone just isn&#39;t adequate.&#34;
    The INTERROBANG can convey in print an attitude, curiosity, and wonder.  <BR>
    <BR>American Type Founders issued a metal typeface in 1966 called Americana which
    included the INTERROBANG. Remington Rand included the key as an option on its
    1968 typewriters, commenting that the INTERROBANG &#34;expresses Modern Life&#39;s
    Incredibility.&#34; In 1996, a New York art studio designed variations of the
    mark for each of the fonts in its computer library.  <BR> <BR>You can find an
    interrobang in Microsoft Word&#39;s Fonts. Go to Format, choose Fonts, then Wingdings
    2. You&#39;ll find 4 different versions of the interrobang. Hit the ` ~ key, the
    ] } key, the 6 ^ key, or the - _ key.  <BR> <BR>  <BR>'

  body: THX Jim, but you must have misunderstood me. I know  <BR>what an interrobang
    is, but not what the one in the  <BR>TypeCon2003 goodie bag was. I presume it&#39;s
    some kind  <BR>of SoTa publication or whatever.

    at the very least, the publication&#39;s designer: Stephen Coles. <BR> <BR>So
    yeah, Interrobang is a little 2-color newslettery type of thing. My scanner is
    broken and I can&#39;t find my digital camera, otherwise I would post some pictures.
    It has an article by Nick Shinn, another by Coles and it features some typefaces
    like Jared&#39;s own... um, yeah, Yakuza. Looks like a pretty cool project.  <BR>
    <BR>And I did not know what interrobang stood for.'

  body: '&#34;Interrobang&#34; is a modest little something &#40;32 pages,  8 1/2&#34;
    x 5 1/2&#34;, black &#43; 1 spot color&#41; for members of SoTA, and for us to
    put in the goody bag at TypeCon...and perhaps the ATypI conference. <BR> <BR>Contents:
    articles &#40;2&#41;, member news items &#40;1&#41;, new typeface designs &#40;5&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I wrote an article for it, so did Stephen Coles. He designed it, using
    several of my typefaces for the editorial matter. Next time &#40;Winter&#41; the
    content and font sources will be different. Bigger and Badder? Leaner and Cleaner?
    -- It remains to be seen, but the kind of content will be similar. <BR> <BR>There
    are 6 new typefaces profiled, from 6 different sources. It&#39;s nice to see a
    variety of new work in print -- there&#39;s not much out there &#40;that isn&#39;t
    a foundry self-promotion&#41; since the demise of Druk. Sure, you get a good perspective
    in the Veer catalog, but there&#39;s no depth on individual typefaces, which &#34;Interrobang&#34;
    provides.'
