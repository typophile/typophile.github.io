  body: 'i''m sorry Zara, you have brought to my attention that this is, in fact,
    a pretty closed-minded site, whereas i clearly got lost in the idea that designers
    are open to all forms of art.  though i understand the pictures i posted, as well
    as many others, are not at all focused on type alone, i hope i never offended
    anyone with my selection of blog postings. but seeing as there is an entire forum
    section for "Design: A-Z, and everything in between," i''m sure you Typohiles
    can handle something with an x-height greater than  12.'
