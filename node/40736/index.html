<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hey there,
Can anyone recommend a good printer in nyc. I have a pretty complicated job to print and would like to work with a printer who has experience workin with small design studios on shorter run high detail projects.
Any recommendations would be really helpful.
thanks a lot in advance!</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Yes I do have two
Both are use to working with small design studios and small design budgets.
Both tend to work well and you can talk to humans.
One is (I've used for 2-color jobs)
Patane Press
228 E 125th St
New York, NY 10035-1738
Phone: (212) 289-1440
(I don't think they have a website - but they do have an FTP site)
The other is (I've used for 4/c Rack Cards, 4/c Biz Cards, etc. -- and yes, nice job, short runs!)
Popular Printing
224 West 35th Street (Between 7th & 8th Ave)
New York, NY, 10001
http://popularprinting.com
P:(212)560.9529
F:(212)560.9528
I've used both in the past 2 years.
Years ago, for quality print runs - I used Peter Malone in Astoria - but they may have gone out of business a few years back. </div>

<div class=commentbody><a href=http://www.greendotprint.com/>Greendot/Produktion</a> has done some great work for me and are very responsive and friendly. I use them regularly for all kinds of work. They are a broker, rather than a printer themselves, but that's worked to my benefit. They also have a very environmentally friendly bent, but will not force it on you at all.
If you call them, ask for Mike DiBugnara and tell him I sent you.</div>

<div class=commentbody>great. I was thinking a broker might be better as the job entails foils, varnishes and embossing they will probably know who can best handle these techniques.</div>

has been doing all sorts of jobs for me since 1980, mostly for non-profit clients. Good for fussy, short-run jobs. They also broker and have different presses at their disposal, including big corporate plants in New Jersey. Mention John S.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I would like to second Jackie T's suggestion for using
PATANE PRESS INC.
We've been using them for quite sometime. They can handle as Jackie says two color printing and short runs with outstanding quality and consistancy. Foil stamping, embossing, die cutting...etc. I have HIGH end FUSSY clients and these guys know what it takes to make them happy.
They also do outstanding 4 color and large runs.
You can always get the owner on the phone to help you plan the job and stay within your clients budgets.
I have just recieved an email stating the launch of their website by the end of April patanepress.com but for now I still contact them below.
Patane Press
228 E 125th St
New York, NY 10035-1738
Phone: (212) 289-1440
Hope this was usefull :)
