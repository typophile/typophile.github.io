  body: Well done, what a nice font.  Sorry we couldn&#39;t have been more help to
    you!  Mike, does this belong in the guide somewhere?

  body: Yes, it does, and I just recently wrote to Joe Treacy about seeing if I can
    get a sample for the Script Font ID Guide. He has helped me that way in the past.
    Of course, if anyone else has it and would like to make a sample, that would be
    great.
