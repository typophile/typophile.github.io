body: "Hey, guys. In need of a specific font.\r\n\r\nI can't seem to find it anywhere,
  or one close enough to it. I know I've seen it many times before and the particular
  instance I've attached is from the video game \"Mega Man X4\". It looks like a serif-style
  font to me. I'm going to be making a similar mock-up selection screen for a website
  and I'd like to emulate the look as close as possible. \r\n\r\nThanks, everyone!"

  body: Hey, that's pretty close! In fact, it looks about the same, just the characters
    being a bit thicker. Thanks, I might end up using it!
