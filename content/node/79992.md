  body: I have done one of these tests using a physical set of colour tabs, and they
    are so finely calibrated that the test results can be thrown off if you accidentally
    touch the surface of one of the tabs, since the oil in your fingertips will affect
    the colour. All of which is to say that I don't think an online version of this
    test, given all the variables of system, gamma, monitor brightness, etc., should
    be taken as anything but a very crude indication of your colour vision acuity.

    don't know about you but I'm loving the way that people are blaming their monitors!
    (If your monitor is badly calibrated, then it's surely badly calibrated throughout
    and not just at the point where one couldn't distinguish between the colours.
    The individual colours being emitted by a badly calibrated monitor are still different,
    surely?\r\n\r\nThe question for me is not, \"Mark and Craig, where did you get
    your fantastic monitors?\" but rather, \"Mark and Craig, what is the secret to
    perfect colour vision, oily fish in your diets?\" Having said that, if you're
    colour blind, you're probably colour blind.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on each
    of the 80 blocks having a maximum mark of 19. I'm guessing points are awarded
    for how close each block is away from the one(s) it's supposed to be next to (or
    something similar).\r\n\r\nHere's a bit of the maths, I think:\r\n1520 = 80 x
    19 (or 4 x 2 x (19+18+17+16+15+14+13+12+11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1)\r\nI guess it's
    hard to explain so they didn't bother trying. \r\n\r\nSuffice it to say, if you
    get 1520 your not as blind as you think as that would involve careful calculation
    to actually keep like colours apart!\r\n\r\nN\r\n"

    - close one eye, look at the white wall and it looks red-ish, look at the wall
    with another eye - green-ish. Then the brain warms up and the perception difference
    goes away, the wall looks white with either eye. The weirdest part though is that
    sometimes it's the left eye that gets red tint and sometimes it's the right one.

    and then close the other in succession. It's like one eye has a cool filter on

    noticed this in myself also. I can\u2019t recall now if the variation transfers
    between eyes. I think in my case it\u2019s consistent (but now, I can\u2019t recall
    which eye carries which cast \u2014 it\u2019s been a while since I paid any attention).
    It does only seem to happen upon waking, as I don\u2019t experience this differential
    by the time I\u2019m up and working.\r\n\r\nI suspect that this phenomenon is
    more prevalent in males and would be related to whatever factors contribute to
    the higher percentage of red-green colorblindness in men.\r\n\r\n"

    this on sunny mornings it might also be a correct one too.\r\n\r\nNick, it sounds
    like your B sensitivity fluctuates, while in my case R and G do. But there's definitely
    a warm/cool effect of perception. This has a weird effect of how waking up and
    looking around with a warm-tinted eye makes the morning seem <em>better</em> and
    more pleasant. It's a fleeting feeling, but it is a noticeable one nonetheless.\r\n\r\nKent,
    next time it happens try remembering if it is R-ed for R-ight or if it's g-R-een
    for R-ight, i.e. 1 or 2. That's how I ended up tracking which one had which tint
    the last time, and it helped noticing the flipping.\r\n"
