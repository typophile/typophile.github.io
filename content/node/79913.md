body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI'm hoping for some help from the experts (that's you).\r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to create copy guidelines (specifically max character counts) for fixed width
  text boxes in a Flash application.\r\n\r\nThings I know:\r\n\r\n\u2022 I am using
  one font, size, weight in a single text box\r\n\u2022 Each text box is different,
  but a fixed pixel width\r\n\u2022 Each text box is populated with dynamic text\r\n\r\nI've
  been recommended TypeBook Creator to get a character count per pica (1.25), then
  I've read that 1 pica = 12 pixels. From that I used a couple of examples of text
  box widths (120px and 240px) to work out a character count (12.5 and 25). But when
  I mock this up in Photoshop, the total characters can be a 15% variance from that
  calculation.\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed some light on this? Is there a known method
  to calculate the character count (max/average/range) for each text box?\r\n\r\nHoping
  someone can help.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatt.\r\n"

    count is always going to be an estimate of some average (whatever that happens
    to mean).\r\n\r\nIf you get a line of content with a lot of capitals or \u2018m\u2019s
    and \u2018w\u2019s, then your character count is going to go way down. If you
    have a line with lots of \u2018i\u2019s \u2018l\u2019s \u2018t\u2019s and a bunch
    of punctuation, then your count can go way up. A 15% variance sounds pretty likely
    to me, if not more."

  body: "Thanks for the reply.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'm making sense myself, but it's
    good to know that the 15% + variance is expected. I guess I was hoping for a tighter
    method.\r\n\r\n"

    fixed and character count becomes very easy to calculate. That\u2019s one of the
    primary advantages of a monospaced font.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll still have variance
    based on the length of any word in proximity to the end, especially if you don\u2019t
    implement any hyphenation. But it will be considerably less.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks again.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I'm not in a position to use a monospaced
    font. \r\n\r\nSo, if the method I'm using is relatively sound, I'll work with
    that and give guidelines to the client with expected variances of character counts.\r\n\r\nThere's
    only so much you can do, right?\r\n\r\n"
