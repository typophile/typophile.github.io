  have reason to believe that the fonts were not custom-made for the bands. These
  guys are not too popular, so I doubt they would hire someone to give them their
  own unique font."

  body: The font used in the first picture is Rudolf Koch's "Wilhelm Klingspor Schrift"
    (or "Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch", as it is usually referred to nowadays), possibly
    one of the finest blackletters ever designed. I have no idea of the fonts used
    in the video and the second picture, although IMHO they do not deserve much attention.

    You might also have a look at G. Helzel's [[http://www.fraktur.biz/|fraktur.biz]]
    (tons of blackletters, although especially intended for writing in German). And
    perhaps you might find something interesting in my own [[http://www.alterlittera.com/|site]].\r\n\r\nCheers."
