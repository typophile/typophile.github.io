  wants me as freelance a designer to use a font that is not a free font or a system
  font, do they need to purchase one license or two (two being one for them, one for
  me)? \r\n\r\nAnd if I own a font, does the organization still need to purchase it
  in order for them to use my design?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It depends on the number of machines that you install it on, usually. MyFonts.com
    lets you select the number and the price varies accordingly. For example, I recently
    had to license Myriad Pro and by fiddling with the number of licences required
    I discovered that the fees go up after five licences, so I got five for the same
    price I would have paid for one.\r\nIn answer to your question, it depends if
    the organisation is going to install it in their office, and if so, how many times.\r\nThis
    answers your second question too. You can license a font and use it in design
    work for your client without them needing to install it on their machines."
