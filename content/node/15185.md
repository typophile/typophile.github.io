body: "Hi all,\r\nI am looking for a Sans that is not Futura, Helvetica, or Gill (paying
  for it is fine).  I would like something that would work well with a circus-themed
  yearbook, and would work well with these fonts: Cast Iron (http://www.abstractfonts.com/fonts/static_Circus_1.html),
  Circus (http://members.fortunecity.com/jlindgren/page07ccircus.html near the end),
  and Big Top (http://www.shamrocking.com/fonts.html under \"Free\" and half-way down
  the list; it is sort of hard to see).\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Will"

    does not have to be a circus font, but should work with the others or have some
    flair.\r\n\r\n-Will"
