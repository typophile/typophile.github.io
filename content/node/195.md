body: My company has a TrueType font for our company logos and unfortunately a couple
  years ago when someone created it, they forgot to check the box marked FREELY REDISTRIBUTABLE.  So
  now when we just bought Acrobat 5, it won&#39;t let us export our own font! <BR>
  <BR>We have since lost our old version of Fontographer and I am looking for a way
  to change this single setting.  Although I would love to do type design one day,
  I don&#39;t have time for that right now.  Are there any utilities or demos I could
  download that would get the job done without having to spend $300?  Thanks! <BR>

  body: I bet there&#39;s someone in our audience that would do it for less than the
    cost of Fontographer. <BR> <BR>Just a thought... I mean you&#39;re talking about
    opening a font, changing a setting and dumping it out again, right? <BR> <BR>//joe
