  a comedic element, it doesn't have to be funny. The most examples I've seen show
  letters expressing the word they build with their shape, rotation or color. It can
  be anything like an album cover or the intro to a movie. The Disney movie Alice
  In Wonderland has a good example:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=1QcVd3r1lWhgtMP9VTp5iRLOrr1lVQ\r\n\r\nThe

  body: Children's books (Shel Silverstein's poetry collections for example) might
    have some ideas. There's one called <em>[[http://www.amazon.com/Chicka-Boom-Bill-Martin-Jr/dp/068983568X|Chicka
    Chicka Boom Boom]]</em> that might work, too.

  body: "the old batman TV show used to use typography to replace violence in the
    show, when they'd crack a guy over the head with a chair, the word \"SMASH\" would
    show on the screen instead of the violence itself.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this
    is what you're going for, but it's a very well-known trick and I think it's genius."
