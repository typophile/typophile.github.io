    target="_blank">http://www.fashion.net</a> <BR> <BR>They seem very similiar to
    bauhaus, the lowercase &#39;a&#39; it appears different from the bauhaus bitmaps
    that I&#39;ve found. <BR> <BR>Would anyone know where I can download this font?

    you find this.  This is a pretty cool pixel typeface.

    site? They might be able to tell you what fonts were used in the design. <BR>

  body: FontsForFlash&#39;s newest, FFF Spacedust, is pretty close to that bold sample.
    <BR> <BR>And I don&#39;t believe the top font is a just bold version of the bottom...
    far too thick.
