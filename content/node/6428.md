    Medium</a> could provide most of those letters, but you would need to modify the
    &#39;g&#39; and perhaps use the &#39;e&#39; from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/vag-rounded/"
    target="_blank">VAG Rounded</a>.  <BR> <BR>If you just want something similar,
    then either of those fonts might work. Frankfurter has the rounded m &amp; n,
    if that is what you liked.
