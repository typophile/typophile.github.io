  body: I took a typography class taught by Joe Kral of <A HREF="www.testpilotcollective.com"
    TARGET="_top">Test Pilot Collective</A>. I had already started to build my own
    fonts, but they all sucked. &#40;For instance, I took the Apple font &#34;Techno&#34;
    and added bumps to it.&#41; <BR> <BR>I was very inspired by this class and redoubled
    my efforts.

    in type. <BR>I for one find it very exciting and know dozen of designers that
    feel the same way without formal education in design. Hey how about David Carson,
    and Tim Girvin, both with no formal education in design. Typography is for everyone
    willing to explore it formally educated in design or not. '

    of Advertising</A>, which I attended. I&#39;m not sure if he has taught since
    moving to San Francisco. <BR> <BR>But he was definitely very knowledgable, very
    passionate about type. TPC hasn&#39;t done much new stuff lately so I hope he
    hasn&#39;t burned out on it.

    may find it significant that Jonathan Hoefler has no formal design education.

  body: ' I agree. It&#39;s really a factor of what passion your pour into it. Although
    I have a formal graphic design education, I formed this board to better my understanding
    of type design, which &#40;besides an emphasis on classic Typography&#41; was
    not covered at the university.  <BR> <BR>I figure we all have things we can share,
    and we all can stand to learn more, even if it is only another person&#39;s methodology
    or point of view. '

  body: ' thank you all for the insight. i was simply curious about this, as it was
    hard for me to imagine people coming in contact with typography without being
    a design student at one time.  i, myself, used to practice my handwriting skills  to
    the point of abusurdity as a child ... i think that i was always obsessed with
    the perfection of letterforms. <BR> <BR>i have not yet taken on the task of creating
    my own typeface, but it is my dream to do so. i appreciate the positive environment
    that this board/site provides for seasoned and novice typophiles, and look forward
    to presenting my work here for you as well. '
