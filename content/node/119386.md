    of the major type databases.\r\n\r\nThe only commercial font I found that is vaguely
    close is Snake Whiskey:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hydro74/h74-snake-whiskey/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Hydro74/\r\n\r\nBraingelt

    a bit dismissive (the animals featured on the Wilson Farms website will sell for
    upwards of $1500 each).\r\n\r\nCreston, Iowa, is also quite close to Des Moines,
    which is the hub of the local chapter of AIGA: http://iowa.aiga.org/\r\n\r\nThey
    may have found a free font, but having a designer do the work is not beyond the
    realm of possibility--nor beyond their means.\r\n\r\n"

    more likely than not they used a free font. I note that the farm didn't go overboard

  body: I'm not suggesting that they hired Pentagram to do a complete branding, but
    having the in-house designer at the local printer or a friend-of-a-friend in Des
    Moines do the work is not as far fetched as some might assume....

    might consider making the letters from scratch or adapting one of the fonts suggested.\r\nIf
    the latter, my first choice would be Insurance Maps. It has the right kind of
    spurs/thorns/mini serifs and the proportions of it's boxy letters can easily be
    adjusted. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/InsuranceMapsSM_6118.jpg]\r\nDon"
