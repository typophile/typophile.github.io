  all the while 70% of all browsers already support a form of embedded fonts, EOT.\r\n\r\nBut
  creating EOT fonts is a pain in the buttocks because you have to use the WEFT thing
  on a PC, and it's not as straight forward as you would think it should be.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know of an *easier* solution? Is there any other way to create an EOT font
  at this time?"

    haven't yet read it carefully enough to know whether it applies to this conversation,
    but it's speaking the right language! Plus, if you aren't following Jon Tan's
    work, I highly recommend that you do.\r\n\r\n:)"
