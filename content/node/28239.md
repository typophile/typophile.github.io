  Anyway, I'm expecting critiques about this one. \r\n\r\nPalmStar is an independent
  movie company founded by Stephen Paternot...what more? Well, visit www.palm-star.com
  for more information. \r\n\r\nAnd here's my treatment for their logo:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/palmstar_5647.gif]\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback & thoughts appreciated. My faves are the first and the last one.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: I like the bottom-most version. The fact that the star is there because of
    white space is really nice. I know the top one does that, but I think the bottom-most
    is more subtle. I might consider moving it up farther away from the type. The
    color of the top-most is more gold, maybe I like that one more. It might be nice
    to see the type attached to that one, the last, from the 4th. :^)

  body: "I do agree with Miss Tiffany. In my opinion on the bottom one as it is now,
    the type is too overwhelming. Its stealing protagonism from the symbol itself.
    \r\nTry it out with the face you've used on the 3rd & 4th. I believe it'll work
    better as a whole."

    you go with #1, I'd  maybe try a 5 or 7 point star."

  body: "Thanks for your very constructive feedback, fellas. Unfortunately, there
    was a huge misunderstanding with the client - in fact he said:\r\n\r\n\"It was
    based on my partner's mother who's palm happens to form creases in the form of
    a star.\"\r\n\r\nSo it's not a palm tree, but rather a palm of a hand...\r\n\r\nNow
    I shall start all over again."
