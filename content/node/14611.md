body: "Some of you may know (or know of) David Weiss, proofreader for The New York
  Times, and documentary filmmaker. I heard today that he died peacefully last Thursday.
  Here is a copy of the notice I received today written by his companion:\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nDavid
  \ Weiss (1911? 1912?- 2005)\r\n\r\n\tDavid Weiss\u2014he would have insisted\u2014\u201CDon\u2019t
  leave out the Loeb. I\u2019m David Loeb Weiss\u201D, died peacefully and painlessly
  at home Thursday, August 11 at 11:12 A.M. Just stopped breathing as I held his hand,
  hospice nurses around us.\r\n\r\n\tHe had been dying for weeks perhaps, still joking,
  not eating, stopped drinking, accepting only a small ice cube in his mouth, not
  talking the last two days, a big change for such a voluble man. It is not his death
  I wish to speak of, rather his life, which I shared for the last eight years.\r\n\r\n\tHe
  was an imperfect man fighting a very imperfect, cruel society. Frequently polemical,
  domineeringly outspoken, and angry at the dehumanization of a class war against
  all of us. He inherited his struggle from birth, remembering his mother climbing
  six flights of tenement stairs after work to sell the Daily Worker.\r\n\r\n\tWhen
  he and his brother Murray split from the Communist Party, they would answer their
  parents\u2019 objections to talking politics at the dinner table, with their ditty,
  \u201CMama don\u2019 want no politicking around\u2019 here.\u201D They\u2019d kid
  her, but he responded to his younger sister\u2019s request and wrote a love letter
  for her to Joseph Starobin, the Communist leader, whom she tried to woo but felt
  inarticulate in aproaching.\r\n\r\n\tHe left public school early, without graduating
  from anything, but finished and earned his B.A. at NYU and M.A. in Political Science
  at the New School for Social Research. Credit to the G.I. Bill that paid for veterans
  to go back to school after World War II.\r\n\r\n\tHe worked and did almost everything.
  Dishwasher, hobo riding the freights across country, busboy, waiter, organizer during
  the hotel and restaurant workers strike in New York, organizer at the Dura-Steel
  strike in Los Angeles, radar technician in the U.S. Army, assistant electrician
  as a merchant seaman, proofreader at the New York Times for eighteen years, documentary
  filmmaker and teacher.\r\n\r\n\tHe was proudest of his films, echoing Muhammed Ali\u2019s
  word when Ali refused to be drafted for the Vietnam war, \u201CNo Vietnamese Ever
  Called me Nigger.\u201D Again in \u201CProfile of a Peace Parade\u201D he raised
  the bar in talking of struggles against imperial wars.\r\n\r\n\tProving his adaptability,
  he wrote, directed, and produced a technical film, \u201CFarewell, Etaoin Shrudlu\u201D
  for the New York Times when they changed over from the old linotype printing to
  the new technology. He later said some fourteen hundred printers might have been
  laid off, but the newspaper fired noone. He was a proofreader, and the newspaper
  gave him carte blanche to go through the plant, talk, film, and produce a prize-winning
  documentary. David loved displaying all his awards and was not modest about them.\r\n\r\n\tHe
  was feisty, contentious, loud, insistent on being heard, intolerant of opposing
  views, and he was frequently correct. As he grew older, his last illness, dementia,
  set in. He\u2019d ask about a pair of twelve-year olds, \u201CWhat are their politics?\u201D
  We\u2019d laugh, because David could not understand he was talking to them in a
  foreign tongue. He had been weaned on \u201CJoe Hill\u201D and \u201CThe Comintern.\u201D
  And like Joe Hill will live \u201Cwhere workers strike and organize\u201D. He\u2019ll
  be there still.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI met David in the 1980s when he came to the
  Twin Cities to show his films. \"Farewell, Etaoin Shrudlu\" is a fascinating film
  about people who work in the field of typesetting and printing and the transitions
  from hot metal to cold type at the Grey Lady. \r\n\r\nDavid was opinionated and
  feisty and a real delight to talk to and even disagree with! The last time I talked
  to him was toward the end of the 1980s when he was setting off to the Soviet Union
  with his camera to work on a new film project. I lost track of him after that but
  I remember him fondly and imagine he's still fighting the good fight wherever he
  is now.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
