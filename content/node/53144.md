  it seems, my most viable source of freelance work is going to dry up. In spite of
  my best efforts, I haven't been able to find anything full-time in graphic design
  \u2014 it's probably a case of many people applying to a few jobs advertised through
  a few channels. \r\n\r\nBefore I start looking to change professions, I thought
  I'd put the problem to typophile. I'm a graphic designer, print and web, of <5 years,
  with an emphasis on books and Flash. I wouldn't be so forthright about this, but,
  well, we have a baby. \r\n\r\nMy e-mail is erichague@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n "
