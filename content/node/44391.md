  invitation. The invite will feature an illustration of a muscle car (Valiant Charger)
  and a cliched hot girl (think Daisy Duke).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on a typeface
  that might complement this illustration?\r\n\r\nCheers "

    to go kitsch so I used Eurostile and Century Old Style.\r\n\r\nHouse Industries
    definitely had some fun ones, particularly Global. I also looked at Magneto."
