  In September, I upgraded from an old edition to the latest (the 11th), and just
  today I noticed a little typographical feature they\u2019ve introduced in this edition.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nEach
  of the 26 large headings that introduce each letter is set in a font whose name
  begins with that letter; then the entire lowercase for that font is shown, and a
  brief note about that font. So, for example, at the start of the \u201CX\u201D pages,
  we have:\r\n\r\n<strong>Xx</strong>\r\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u
  v w x y z\r\n<strong>Xtasy Sans</strong> Designed by Steve Jackaman in 1997. UK.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I spotted this, I was near the back of the dictionary, so naturally I flicked backwards
  through it, looking at each letter heading in turn. After a moment, I started covering
  up the description before I could read it, to see if I could recognise the font.
  Some were easy: \u201CU\u201D was Univers, \u201CS\u201D was Sabon, and so on. Others
  I wasn\u2019t familiar with: Quorum, Isbell.\r\n\r\nAs I got back past Courier and
  Baskerville, I naturally thought, <em>I wonder what \u201CA\u201D is going to be?
  Surely not</em> Arial<em>?</em>\r\n\r\nTurning the page, I found that it did indeed
  say:\r\n\r\n<strong>Aa</strong>\r\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w
  x y z\r\n<strong>Arial</strong> Designed by Robin Nicholas and Patricia Saunders
  in 1982. UK.\r\n\r\nBut, and this is the reason I bring up the whole dreary story,
  this heading was <em>not</em> set in Arial. It was set in ... Helvetica! I probably
  wouldn\u2019t have noticed if they\u2019d done it the other way round and set the
  \u201CHh\u201D of Helvetica in Arial, but the difference between the two fonts\u2019
  <em>a</em>s is so eye-jabbingly obvious that it made me laugh all the way to my
  laptop, to tell someone...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dictionary_3606.png]\r\n\r\nAdded
  irony comes from the fact that the actual body text of the definitions themselves
  uses Optima <strong><em>and Arial!</em></strong>"

    substitution? Could be. They could have bypassed the whole issue by using Akzidenz
    Grotesk.\r\n\r\nThough I've just made myself chuckle some more by looking at the
    imprint page to see who the typesetters were... and finding it's the same people
    I have to deal with every day setting our journals. Should've known!"
