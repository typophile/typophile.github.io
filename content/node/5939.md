body: I&#39;m new to Fontlab. <BR>I&#39;m curious about you&#39;re way to bring you&#39;re
  Illustrator design characters to Fontlab 4.5. <BR> <BR>The only way I found is blowing
  the characters&#40;corresponding to 12pt&#41; at around 4000%. <BR>Previously, in
  FOG, I only have to cut/paste&#40;yeah with alt down, of course!&#41; with a maximum
  scale rectangle. <BR> <BR>And you? <BR>
