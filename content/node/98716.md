body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nSo I have been working the last year or two on a Grotesk
  sans-serif, and have recently started on my italics.\r\n\r\nAfter referencing a
  few other grotesks, I've noticed that the slant angle is always about 2-3 degrees
  less on round characters like C, O, e, etc...\r\n\r\nSo for instance, say on a roman
  weight of a sans the characters like I, L, H, N, etc.. have a slant of 12 degrees,
  it seems like 9 times out of 10, characters like C and O are only at a 9 degree
  slant.\r\n\r\nMy question is, what is the reason for this, and is it a discretionary
  thing for the designer or something that is pretty well known as needing to be done
  in the type design world.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJosh"

  body: "When you slant a circle, what you get is a perfect ellipse, but the visual
    impression of the shape's tilt mostly comes from the focal axis of that ellipse
    (the line that corresponds to the 45\xB0 diagonal of the circle), making it seem
    more severely slanted than rectilinear glyphs at the same slant. Also, perpendicular
    to that axis is what we see as the ellipse's width, which makes it look too condensed.
    You'll also notice that the left extreme is very low and the right extreme is
    very high.\r\n\r\nA reduced slant may do the job, but ideally what you want to
    do is edit the shape, raising the left side and lowering the right side, to make
    a thing that is geometrically more complex but subjectively reads as a \"leaning
    circle\" as round as the original."

    it to someone else in the course of my work (to show that I would actually be
    doing something beyond "pushing the magic button" to make italics).

  body: "cerulean and PabloImpallari, thanks for sharing your observations!  I had
    not thought about how slanting a circle results in an ellipse that is even steeper
    inclined.  I'm trying to work out some of the calculations behind the resulting
    slant, and had some questions:\r\n\r\nWhen you do the correction, do you always
    split the desired slant equally between a slant and a rotation?  For instance,
    Briem gives an example where a desired slant of 12.5 degrees is achieved through
    combining a slant of 6.25 degrees and a rotation of 6.25 degrees.\r\n\r\nWhen
    combining the slant and the rotation, where are the origins of those transformations?
    \ Are they in the same place?  At the bottom left of the shape, or in the center?
    \ Or do none of these things matter?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nStephen\r\n"

  body: I haven't had too much luck with PabloImpallari's link... I'm dealing with
    a pretty straight forward sans at a 10 degree slant, and I can't seem to get the
    results the tutorial seems to be so pleased with. I even tried doing a bit of
    a quick test with another font to see if it matched up with the actual italic
    weight but no luck.

  body: "The closest trick i've seen to find is by rotating half the desired italic
    amount (so 6 if you want a 12 degree italic), then slant by the same amount (6
    again), fix extrema, and the do little bits of weight tweaking. Not sure if that
    is proper or not, haha, but it seems to slightly do the trick. \r\n\r\nItalics
    can be hard for a newbie!"
