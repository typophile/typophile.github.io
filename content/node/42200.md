body: From my thesis research I am getting the impression that FFMeta represents the
  first time an organization commissioned a typeface intended to become its typographic
  identity on all printed output (at least in the context of organizational systems,
  obviously newspaper and magazines commissions predate it). Is this correct, or is
  the popularity of FFMeta overshadowing another important design?

    University of California, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if this goes back to the
    19th century...

    typeface that was meant to be used for <em>everything</em>, not just running copy
    or advertising or a signage system. I am looking for the commission that said
    \u201Dwe want to stop printing everything from business cards to our truck lettering
    in Helvetica and print everything in our own typeface\u201D and I think that the
    Meta commission might be that moment. "

    that corporations, or at least a few publicly funded ones, in Germany in the 1930s

  body: "It's a question of feasibility.\r\nHow would a large corporation have handled
    its everyday media at diverse locations, in the past, at various times in history?\r\nAnd
    what kind of media would they have been?\r\n\r\nFor instance, a corporation would
    have had many suppliers: a design firm for its identity, perhaps another for packaging,
    an ad agency to handle national media, but local offices, outlets and distributors
    would have used local suppliers and marketing firms for things like co-op ads,
    flyers, point of purchase material, brochures and signage, as well as in-house
    material, as few branch offices/plants would have had their own print shops.\r\n\r\nIn
    the past, where would local suppliers have got custom fonts from? The cost would
    have been prohibitive to outfit provincial type and signage shops with a custom
    face.\r\nThat is why in the early years of corporate identity, there was a nice
    dove-tail with modernist simplicity by using Futura, Univers and Helvetica as
    the text font component of an ID, because they were readily available everywhere.
    These faces were often used indiscriminately and interchangeably--if for no other
    reason than it made life more interesting for local designers.\r\n\r\nSo pre-digital
    it was quite feasible for a consumer product corporation to have a custom face
    for a national advertising campaign (and that was happening in the 1950s in the
    US, using relatively inexpensive phototypositor technology), or for a publication
    or publisher to have a custom face (they controlled printing centrally), but for
    companies with more generic or diverse requirements, not so easy. \r\n\r\nCorporations
    that are more centralized and vertically integrated, such as a national post office,
    and are not so reliant on local print suppliers, producing more of their literature
    in one place, so would have been better able to implement a custom face.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    too much for me. On the upside, this thread and the related writing and research
    have made me realize that Meta, on of the typefaces that spurred much of my research,
    isn\u2019t particularly relevant to my thesis. \r\n\r\nAs Dan noted, Bayer\u2019s
    Universal Alphabet was not a typeface. It was an attempt at total reform of the
    alphabet, and Bayer developed it on his own, not as a commission. New alphabets
    and orthographies were a really hot topic at the time, and the new alphabet was
    one of many\u2014often very good\u2014such ideas that came out of Weimar Germany."
