  off your knowledge by casually mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it,

  fellow Typophiles with.</li>\r\n<li>The winner produces a new challenge -- a portion

  a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.</li>\r\n<li>The person who posts a challenge can't

  body: Stempel Schneidler Light Upper Case Q. Designed by F.H.Ernst Schneidler in
    1936 for the Bauer type foundry. I've used it often in ads and brochures. The
    only letter I've never understood in the Light font is the upper case O, which
    has almost no thicks or thins, and looks wrong to my eye due to that.

    one is base on the O."
