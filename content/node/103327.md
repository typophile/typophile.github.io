  LINK TO IMGUR</a>\r\n\r\nI've provided two because the information is not identical
  and I'm hoping the additional letters will be helpful.\r\n\r\nI was able to identify
  the following:\r\nMarie Andersen and Rachelle/Justin - Aller\r\n5 pounds - Lobster\r\n\r\nHowever
  the rest are a little bit harder to find.\r\n\r\nNatasha/Julie appears slightly
  rounded at the corners.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 29th; Oklahoma City, OK; and the length (19
  inches/17.75 inches) appear to be the same font with different weights but I am
  not positive.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the fonts seem to be all different. In summary,
  I need help finding the following:\r\nFirst name:\r\nDate/City/length:\r\nYear:\r\nWeight/ounces:\r\nTime:\r\n\"loving
  parents\":\r\n\r\nThank you and I hope I was specific enough!"

  body: "Thank you both so much! Those are spot on. It seems like a good number of
    the fonts came from that fontsquirrel so I'm combing through the fonts right now
    to find more matches.\r\n\r\n\"ounces\" \"inches\" and \"AUGUST 29TH\"  are also
    quicksand.\r\n\r\nThe font used for the time also seems to be a condensed Sansumi.\r\n\r\nNatasha
    and Julia appear to be <a href=\"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas-neue\">Bebas
