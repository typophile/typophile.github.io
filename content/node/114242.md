body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nI have a client wanting to redesign a magazine, including
  fonts for body text as well as headers, callouts, etc. What is the best way to compile
  and show, on paper, what different fonts look like in print? I'm finding that some
  foundries have PDF samples of text, but others and MyFonts don't, so not sure what
  the best strategy would be. Any resources you recommend?\r\n\r\nThanks so much for
  your help.\r\n\r\n-Ella"
