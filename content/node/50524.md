    As long as there is "Branding" there will be custom type design. '

  body: "Like much of the type market, information is mainly anecdotal.\r\nI'm sure
    my experience is very different from James'--although I agree with his theory
    of the brand-driven impetus.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested about this sort of thing
    Jon, you could commission a survey now, and follow up later to see if there has
    been a change. It would involve analyzing a list of foundries and seeing what
    they reveal about their custom work. However, they might not reveal all their
    custom work (I don't get around to posting everything I do, whether or not I am
    happy with the results), and just scanning foundries might not pick up all active
    work. For instance, some lettering artists also do custom type design, such as
    Ian Brignell's new font for <a href=\"http://www.ianbrignell.com/\">Bell</a>.\r\n\r\nCustom
    type varies by country. I get the impression there is more corporate work in the
    UK, more periodical work in North America.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Hrant's concern,
    I would say that declining news sales in the US, coupled with consolidation (both
    economic and technological), might lead to a reduced demand for custom news fonts.
    On the other hand, technology can open up new markets (on the internet perhaps?)
    \r\n\r\nWhile it might seem that an economic downturn would reduce the budget
    for custom type, on the other hand, a dramatic change in the zeitgeist could rapidly
    obselesce exisiting identities, leading to a demand for rebranding. And then of
    course, with bankruptcies and takovers, new corporate identites emerge which will
    require expression. Recession as opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    of saturating a market still applies, imo. How many typefaces do you use? How
    many do you need? How much new stuff is exciting enough?\r\n\r\nSomething to think
    about: the implementation of OpenType is probably an impetus for continuing growth
    is type sales, but the time will come where this technology has matured with the

  body: "Like a lot of other products/services there will be a high end part of the
    business where snobbish people/firms will want to display their uniqueness by
    commissioning custom typefaces (example: David Berlow did a fontfamily for some
    billionaire who wanted the digital interfaces for his multimillion dollar ship
    to reflect the excellence he aimed for in every aspect of its design and build
    \u2014 David presented that during Type 2008). [Fashion: haute couture like John
    Galliano).\r\n\r\nA larger, but still small group of companies/individuals will
    buy the more exclusive and pricy fonts that might for instance trickle down to
    the market after their exclusive rights have ended. Some designers may cater to
    this group. (Fashion: like Dries van Noten).\r\n\r\nA greater part of the market
    will just follow the trends that smart marketeers will initiate. As happens in
    a lot of other fashionlike industries (cars, clothes, shoes, etc.). Fast-and-furious
    typedesigners could make a bundle here (Kris is fast!), but they need marketing
    prowess and power. (Fashion: Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren).\r\n\r\nThe masses will
    just use what comes along, preferably free, maybe with some likeness to what is
    hip. But most of all: cheap. Think of thousands of name\u2013 and faceless type-engineers
    in sweatshops in China or Vietnam, drawing/building quick and dirty knockoffs
    of bestselling typefaces, marketing them through the internet, or by including
    10 cent coupons in breakfast cereals. (Fashion: Hennes & Mauritz, GAP).\r\n\r\nA
    pretty bleak future, I realise now. : )\r\n\r\n\r\nHrant: leaders of government
    have seldom shown any degree of good taste. That is not going to change soon,
    I think. In the Netherlands the powers that be have decided that all of the different
    identities of governmental departments and organisations have to go and in future
    one Identity Program for All will be used. If they had done that 15 years ago,
    some very fine typefaces (like Lud[as] de Groots Corpid) would not exist. \r\nEuro
    money looks awful, esp for us Dutch who had arguably the most beautiful paper
    money in the world \u2014 Roger Pfunds Swiss stuff is also okay, I give them that
    \u2014, and that was the result of a decision by a handful of so called leaders
    and civil servants, who apparantly had no taste as well. More of this is going
    to happens as institutions become larger and larger and less democratic.\r\n\r\nShit,
    reading what I wrote, the future looks even bleaker now. My plans to do some typedesigning
    probably will have to wait another twenty years, when I can do it as a hobby\u2026\r\n\r\n.

    is one way of looking at it. Another way could be that when the deck is rolling,
    the rain is coming down in sheets, and the salt is stinging your eyes, why would
    you also want to read 60% horizontally scaled 8.2 point Bank Gothic on a 14 mm
    square button, or a MS \"Cleartype font\" with CAD operator-quality typography?
    Additionally, fashion, to a great extent, depends on people seeing the fashion,
    which is also hardly the case in the plucked instance. I am not saying I've never
    done custom type design for the sake of fashion, but the boat fonts were not one
    such instance. \r\n\r\nI believe the market is growing. The reason I say so, is
    because we've  always been busy with it for 20 years now, and though we used to
    'own' a 100% market share, there are now hundreds of custom font designers, and
    we only have a 1% market share for the same amount of work being done by us. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    separate from the question of formats, though, I think there are plenty of unexplored
