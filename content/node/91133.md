  503c\r\nGB D6B5\r\nCJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-503c\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me find this

  body: "The trouble with using a Japanese font for setting Chinese is that despite
    a great many shared characters the two languages are different.  The [[http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=503C&useutf8=true|Unicode
    look-up for \u503C]] doesn't give a Japanese mapping for the character, nor a
    listing in major Japanese dictionaries, so you'll probably need a Chinese font.
    \ The fact that the character has both GB and Big-5 encoding suggests it is available
    in most Chinese fonts, and perhaps you already know that \"Mincho\" is \"Ming\"
    in Chinese. \r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "If you can sort your glyphs by Unicode (such is possible, for instance, with
    InDesign) or you can <em>type in</em> the Unicode for this character (OS X allows
    that; rumour has it that Windows also can, I don't know how) you don't have to
    \"find\" it -- it's there in the font or it is not.\r\n\r\nIf it is, you'll see
    it. If it is not, then you'll see the default \"Not available\" character for
    the font (usually just an empty square). If it's not in the font, you have to
    find another one that comes close, design-wise, and either use that font for all
    of your text (recommended), or use it for just this single character (not recommeded,
    unless you are highly skilled in spotting the design differences between the two.
    Compare this to using an Arial \"A\" inside a Times Roman Text.).\r\n\r\nYou can
    try \"Fonts that support...\" on <a href=\"http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/503c/index.htm\">Fileformat.info</a>
    -- I have had mixed experience with these, good and bad.\r\n"

  body: "The corresponding Japanese character is encoded at U+5024 (\u5024). If you
    absolutely must use the Chinese form, then the closest (design-wise) Chinese font
    on Mac OS X that includes a glyph for U+503C is \u534E\u6587\u5B8B\u4F53.ttf (STSong)."

  body: "The OP reports he is setting Chinese, and my point is that in such work it
    is generally wise to start with a Chinese font and look farther afield only when
    necessary.  \u503C versus \u5024 both illustrates and complicates the issue.  Lin
    Yutang's 1972 Chinese-English dictionary uses \u503C for the headword, but says
    (91A.30-1) \u5024 is the form usually used in print; DeFrancis' 1996 Alphabetically-Based
    Computerized C-E dictionary uses \u503C and ignores \u5024.  The Unicode look-up
    gives the same reference for both forms in the 1931 Mathews C-E dictionary, #975;
    however, Mathews -- which frequently shows variants -- in this instance gives
    only \u5024. \r\n\r\nOut in the world of fonts, Arphic's Big-5 font \"AR Mingti
    Light Big5\" uses the glyph \u5024 at the codepoints where Big-5 and Unicode have
    \u503C, supporting the notion the two forms are interchangeable; not surprisingly,
    the same foundry's Unicode 3 font \"AR MingU30\" has both forms at their proper
    Unicode locations.  The Kozuko Mincho and Gothic fonts that Adobe bundles with
    InDesign do not include \u503C, but they do offer a variant glyph for \u5024 at
    the same code-point (i.e., <em>not</em> \u503C -- though many other Kozuko variants
    point to alternates with separate code-points).\r\n\r\nSo it's probably okay to
    swap \u503C for \u5024 in Chinese text, though the former may seem more \"modern.\"
    \  But how about \u5167/\u5185 and \u8AAA/\u8AAC?  If you know which one you want,
    InDesign can use Kozuko Mincho's alternate forms feature to swap the underlying
    codes.  The trick, of course, in knowing what the author or editor intends, even
    if they don't always know themselves.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "The bottom line is that if you are intending to typeset some text in Simplified
    Chinese, you should be using a Simplified Chinese font, not a Japanese one. In
    terms of fonts that are bundled with Mac OS X, the \u534E\u6587\u5B8B\u4F53.ttf
    (STSong) font is the closest to Hiragino Mincho ProN W3, design-wise."
