body: "I am not a professional typeface designer. Still, in our modern world, one
  simply cannot avoid typefaces, and I have some observations about what I commonly
  see about the numerals in typefaces.\r\n\r\nBriefly, it seems to me that numerals
  are generally designed as though they were just ten more characters to take care
  of, like thorn and eth to non-Icelanders, rather than <em>numerals.</em>\r\n\r\nThe
  main reason I feel this way is the width and spacing of numerals. To me, it should
  be <em>immediately</em> apparent which is the units, tens, hundreds, etc., digit
  of a number. This is why I strongly prefer monospaced numerals in almost all contexts.
  I am guessing that commas for large numbers are useful mainly because proportional
  digits make it hard to see at once exactly how many digits a number has, and which
  place each digit occupies.\r\n\r\nAnother reason has to do with lowercase numerals
  and the \"flow of text\". First of all, one's eye probably <em>should</em> slow
  down when reading numerals: after all, they are more information-dense than words.
  So what reason is there to be concerned that the numerals are too distracting? Sure,
  I can see why some people do not like European numerals in Devanagari text, but
  that is not what I mean. Devanagari numerals do not try to camouflage themselves
  as letters: the lack of the upper bar makes them stand out. But European numerals
  in Latin text do not have some automatic \"I'm not a word\" feature, unless you
  give them one.\r\n\r\nThird, numerals are often not designed to look distinct. For
  example, the \"6\" and \"9\" in many typefaces can look too much like an \"8\".
  An example of apparent awareness of, and solution to, this problem can be found
  in Futura. Perhaps the hardest digit to design is \"3\", because it looks too much
  like three other digits: \"5\", \"8\", and \"9\".\r\n\r\nI will end with a link
  to something beautiful. (Would it be nearly as beautiful with proportional digits?)\r\n[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsCx8wUF3bg&feature=related]]"

  body: "You also objected vehemently to proportionally spaced as well as \"oldstyle\"
    (lowercase) figures when designing a calendar in another thread. (Note that proportional
    spacing and lowercase appearance are two different things, and numerals can be
    neither, either, or both.)\r\n\r\nI don't see anything particularly beautiful
    in your YouTube link, but I do notice that every example you've given of lining
    numerals is from video game typography, which is hugely different from print typography.
    You may be right that in video games, monospaced lining figures are best, for
    a variety of reasons including comparison of different scores, as well as users'
    expectations of a certain figure style. However, how often do numbers with four
    or more digits appear in, say, a novel? In situations where it is imperative to
    quickly read many places of digits, such as math texts, you'll notice that monospaced
    lining figures are, in fact, the norm. (Whether this is actually beneficial, though,
    I'm not sure.)\r\n\r\nI don't agree that in the context of running text numbers
    should be clearly different from words. In this context, numbers <em>are</em>
    words. They are just a shorthand form for writing, for instance, \"seventeen seventy-six\"
    with only four characters.\r\n\r\nYour other point about making similar figures
    clearly distinct is actually helped by using oldstyle figures. You can't confuse
    a 9 and a 6 when one drops below the line and the other doesn't. Same with with
    a 3 and an 8. Oldstyle figures, I would conclude, are much easier to scan, and
    I've always thought it would be worth reviving them even in very math-heavy texts,
    if only as an experiment."

    do not like numbers as words. But then again, I am the kind of person who gets
    confused if you say \"quarter to six\" rather than \"five forty-five\". Personally,
    I feel that English number words, especially for large numbers, sound overly formal
    and long-winded, and the digits are often recited out of order. (For something
    better on both counts, see Turkish number words, or Hungarian.) And I don't think
    any of these languages can handle, for example, \"4,000,750\" without tripping
    up the listener. "

  body: "In a scoreboard-type situation (like the score in a video game) it makes
    sense to use lining numerals. Makes it quick and easy to read the number and compare
    scores.\r\n\r\nBut numbers appearing in a sentence are a different situation and
    the rules can vary depending on which style guide the writer is using. The often-used
    Chicago Manual of Style, for example, says that in non-technical writing any number
    smaller than one hundred should be spelled out, such as \"My daughter is two years
    old.\". Larger numbers are written as numerals, such as \"It's 237 miles to New
    York.\". \r\n\r\nThere are a number of exceptions for special circumstances. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    have a feeling that the root of the problem is this: Most, if not all, of these
    typefaces were designed for print, and for contexts in which numerals would be
    used only sparingly. For contexts which use a great many numerals, monospaced
    digits might be more preferable. Contexts in which numerals are animated, such
    as a digital clock, or a real-time display of a stock market index, practically
    cry out for monospaced digits.\r\n\r\nJust as I can easily select \"bold\" or
    \"italic\" for a font, I would like to be able to select \"monospace\" for digits.
    For fonts with proportional digits, the last-resort implementation of this could
    be simply to expand the space around thinner digits to make all digits the same
    width as the widest digit."

  body: "Dates and times look perfectly fine to me set in proportional figures.\r\n\r\nYour
    example of a bus-schedule is one where the dates and times occur <em> in a table
    </em>. Of course you will want tabular figures in this context (after all, that's
    what they're designed for), but that certainly doesn't imply that tabular figures
    are preferable in <em>non</em>-tabular contexts.\r\n\r\nIn running text tabular
    figures are awkward because they don't space well -- the digit one is inevitably
    going to create problems.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely why many faces include both
    proportional and tabular figures. The proportional figures generally look better
    <em>except</em> in those contexts where a tabular arrangement is needed.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Decimal fractions in a proportional font look particularly horrible. Once
    I read a book on calendars which contained many decimal fractions, each and every
    one in proportional figures, and these were oldstyle figures at that. This was
    just about the worst choice of type imaginable. Even when not in tables, reading
    decimal fractions in this type was like trying to use a funhouse mirror to aid
    in grooming oneself.\r\n\r\nSure, if you show the digit 1 as a simple vertical
    stroke, then you get spacing problems. Another way you end up with problems is
    with a small, oldstyle digit 1 that looks like a scared child trying to hide.\r\n\r\nTo
    me, the space around the digit 1 is almost part of the character. Maybe I just
    have different ideas about kerning. Once I saw the sequence \"r.\" kerned so that
    the arm of the \"r\" was directly above the full stop, as though trying to conceal
    it. I thought that was just plain wrong, like going swirnrning in the surnrner."

    the serif on the \"1\". (Well, it <em>is</em> Eurostile, after all, and how do

    the designer does things: probably first design the digits, then worry about how
    much or how little space they use up. Hence, proportional digits. Not: decide
    how much space you want each digit to gobble up, then design accordingly."

    is for all software that prepares formatted text (i.e. it lets you use proportionally-spaced

    that any font might have.\r\n\r\nThis might be achieved, for example, by changing

    the variations in their fonts accessible on all software, for example by including
    multiple fonts in the package, so that people can select the font with small capitals
    or old-style numerals from software that does not have OpenType support yet.\r\n\r\nFonts
