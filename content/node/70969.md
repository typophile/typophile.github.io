  to identify who it was designed by and when, but it's proving rather elusive.\r\n\r\nOnly
  thing I've managed to find out it is owned and released by Scangraphic \r\n(or possibly
  Elsner+Flake, depending on where you look), but can't verify whether\r\nthe design
  can be credited to them also.\r\n\r\nAnyone know any more than that?\r\n\r\nThanks,

  body: It appears to be a knock-off of some flavor of Century, which was designed
    by Morris Fuller Benton.

  body: Actually, I think it's Scangraphic's version of <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/excelsior/">Excelsior</a>,
    designed by Chauncey Griffith in 1931.
