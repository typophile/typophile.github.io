  the decomposed form instead (U+0061 + U+0301).</li>\r\n<li>Is there some way to

  diacritics (like the combining solidus) supposed to be used? I think these don't
  appear in decomposition.</li>\r\n<li>In cases where one changes the shape of the
  diacritic of the precomposed form due to mistakes in the encoding (like the cedilla
  for a comma for the Latvian characters), what can I do if someone really wants to

  algorithms?.</li>\r\n<li>Is there some font that provides support for the combining

  body: "In order:\r\n\r\n1) Technically yes, but it depends on your software, which
    at least between InDesign and the various Apple apps on my machine, is a no in
    practice.  Oddly enough it seems software is hell-bent on recomposing characters
    before displaying them, when I'm quite sure the composed codepoints are legacy
    and they should actually be DEcomposing these before displaying.\r\n2) Yes, contextual
    alternatives.\r\n3) I asked about this a while back (I'll look for the link in
    a bit), and the answer is no, they're not used, but might as well put it.\r\n4)
    I'll let someone else answer that more assuredly, but I'd guess since the languages
    that change them are finite (and more importantly, known in advance), you could
    make the unchanged form the default, and then set the changed forms as a language-based
    alternate.\r\n5) My Coru\xF1a does, but it's still a good ways from seeing release. "
