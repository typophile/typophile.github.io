  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Proxy  Magazine  — Adobe vol.1 no.4:</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a paradox, but Lucille Tenazas doesn’t see it that way. As the principal of San Francisco’s Tenazas Design and founding chair of the graduate program in design at the California College of the Arts (formerly CCAC), she has long been known for her innovative typography. But rarely does she reach for anything but the most common classical typefaces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that the less expressive a typeface is, the more creative a designer can be with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“ If you have a strong image you can use it to recontextualize the type and give it a character all its own.&quot;</p>
<p>Tenazas’s award-winning work tends to do just that: juxtapose a powerful image with a meaningful arrangement 
of type. By using subtle contrasts between serif and sans serif, as well as weight, she turns what’s sometimes considered bland type into powerful statements.</p>
<p>I believe that the test of a good designer is how well he or she deals with type,” she says. 
“ Good typography should be intuitive and structural at the same time.”</p>

<p>Or express himself at all, through type or anything else. But that&rsquo;s a different issue. No matter how talented/skilled a designer is in a certain niche (often merely a result of arbitrary self-imposed limitations) we cannot ignore the negative implications of shunning fonts beyond a small &ldquo;classic&rdquo; set. Furthermore, type is the point of Typophile, so that issue is what needs the most focus here.</p>

<p>True William. Part of a good designers job is to help the client &ldquo;see the problem&rdquo; and articulate it with delineation of audience, purpose, message, and desired action.  (Paul Rand was a master at this.) Design is about problem solving. This includes far more non-visual work than people not in the design field understand. It is hard sometimes to convince a client that comes to you holding something and says, &ldquo;Make me one of these&rdquo; that &ldquo;one of those&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t solve his problem.  The easiest part of being a designer is when you are just doing the design. The rest is the real work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My readng of that quote is: A) a cautionary statement to budding designers, and B) an articulation of <em>focus</em> in a design piece: if the type calls for less attention, the other elements will receive that attention (or have to pick up the slack), and therefore the  &ldquo;more creative&rdquo; the designer can be/has to be with other elements.</p>
<p>Also, she&rsquo;s expressing her own take on the design process. I don&rsquo;t think one or the other is &lsquo;better&rsquo; because I&rsquo;ve seen and appreciated examples of both. It&rsquo;s the <em>knowing</em> about these visual balances and trade-offs that seems most important to me.</p>
<p>Just becuase I have a deep appreciation for variety in type design doesn&rsquo;t mean I won&rsquo;t use Helvetica or Garamond to keep the type toned down next to an image that does the job. This is, of course, coming from a graphic designer, not a type designer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Basic typography courses often start students off with exercises that force them to do a lot of things with one or two boring typefaces (stilted Bodonis, Times, Helvetica). At that stage, it&rsquo;s useful for them to learn how to use type. Later, after one has presumably learned how to use it and has control over the type, the designer can indeed do a lot of things with type that even the type designer might not have imagined, and not all bad, either.</p>
<p>Still, one arrives at a threshold with a certain typeface where there isn&rsquo;t anything else you can get out of it. Certain Bodoni cuts dry up and fade off the page with a certain amount of use. They look empty, weak, or at best, like throwbacks or imitations of 70&rsquo;s ads. At that point I would indeed urge a conservative designer to crack open the internet and discover the world of new powerful typefaces. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s categorically weak or unimaginative for a designer to want to see how much they can get out of a certain established face. I just hope that they don&rsquo;t hobble themselves by being dogmatic about it and refusing to look around. The internet itself is the most obvious example.</p>

<p>James, you&rsquo;re so right that expression is unavoidable (which is certainly great, although only if it&rsquo;s not made a fetish). Warde/Morison were full of it.

<p>Norbert makes good points. It is the limitations an artist chooses that define the artist. Recently I was at a Dan Flavin show where the progress of his art could be seen in the refinement of his limitations. No one claims that Flavin is better because he uses ready made materials.</p>
<p>We are reacting to the idea that the design is better for limiting itself to classic faces, when the point is that good design can be built with classic and/or contemparary faces.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think I&rsquo;m allowing for the possibility that Tenazas is a conservative designer, who chooses a minimal palette. She seems fully in control of the type she&rsquo;s using, and a separate issue for any designer is which typefaces they choose. A really good designer can get mediocre and poorly-made typefaces to look better than they are. A good designer can get more freshness out of stale type. But I think the designer who masters typography and then ignores all but 4 type designs is not really making the most of type.</p>
<p>In the best of worlds, the designer uses expression to enhance the editorial message (not their own ego), and I don&rsquo;t think this can be fully realized using only Bodoni and News Gothic. But it&rsquo;s important to discern between skilled typography that seems boring, and inept typography.</p>
<p>I think Tenazas is skilled but dogmatic. There&rsquo;s a passive-aggressive voice in her work that refuses to really let go of the &ldquo;expressiveness&rdquo; of seemingly inexpressive type. It&rsquo;s maybe not paradoxical but dishonest.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I recall a period in the 60s when there was a hot new type that became &ldquo;in&rdquo; every few months. There was a time when every head was set in Cooper Black. That ad had to be great because it was set in Cooper.  This is what I used to call the &ldquo;Typeface of the Month Club&rdquo; period. Everyone was &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; the in face and all the ad agency account reps were throwing type names around like they would save the world from nuclear holocaust.  About 75% of the ads were pure crap because all they did was use the &ldquo;cool font&rdquo;.
You can fail at design both by excluding all but the same blessed few types or you can fail by using a new one every month. It is about the skill, knowledge, and talent of the designer, not how big or small his toolbox is.  The world is a big place, there is room for everyones way of working.  There is no need to point and chastise those who don&rsquo;t do it your way.  Do your own work and do it well. Discussing differences in work habits is fine but putting down others for not doing it your way is more dogmatic than confining yourself to a few trusted types. So, how many types did Garamond, Caslon, and Gutenburg use?

<p>So true, Chris.
But aahhhh&hellip; it was great &ldquo;type marketing&rdquo; which really hit it&rsquo;s zenith between the mid-seventies to mid-eighties. [[Aaron Burns]] of ITC and [[Mike Parker]] of Linotype were two maestros of making fonts fashionable. This has less to do with the current topic thread, but stimulating markets to purchase fonts and building huge libraries of typeface went hand-in-hand with the <em>Hardware Wars</em> between Linotype, Monotype, Berthold and Compugraphic.</p>
<p>The metal that had to be sold was in the form of high-end proprietary typesetting equipment, and if it couldn&rsquo;t output the hottest and biggest selection of type then sales suffered badly.</p>
<p>Another topic for another day.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant is also right that not managing to choose type in a sensitive way is disfuctional. It just is.</p>
<p>But it is also true that alot of graphic design tries to ride on the font choice to a degree which is excessive. Even if the the example is extreme it is getting at a reasonable point. The idea of showing that you can do strong work with a more limited set of fonts is a good one. Limiting choices in graphic design is sometimes a good way of getting focus on a problem.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I see with the text is the idea that certain fonts are &lsquo;classic&rsquo;. Our society is all too ready to create &lsquo;classics&rsquo;. The idea of Classic Rock &amp; Classic Fonts are both ideas borne of an impetus to bland insensitive lazy reductivism. It will be &lsquo;classic punk&rsquo; &amp; eventually &lsquo;classic vegis&rsquo; next. I think I&rsquo;ll choose my own &lsquo;classics&rsquo; if at all.</p>

<p>Yes, romance is bad, bad - it does lead straight to hell.
Much better to wear a straightjacket and put on blinders.
Both black of course: having to choose an actual color
when getting dressed is way too stressful.</p>
<p>What leads straight to hell (in fact it&rsquo;s doing
it right now, globally) is the lust for Control.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It depends why you limit it (and noting here that the parallel between painting and typography can&rsquo;t be taken very far). The evidence is that Tenazas, Vignelli and their ilk probably mostly do it for one reason: they simply can&rsquo;t handle more.</p>
