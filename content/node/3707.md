    also one of the few books that I&#39;ve bought multiple copies of, just to have
    extras to loan out. &#40;The others being Watchmen, Why I Hate Saturn, and Information
    Rules.&#41; <BR> <BR>T

    been skimming through it and already picked up a few things. <BR> <BR>It looks
    like such a nicely designed book as well. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m full of warm fuzzies
    right now just thinking about it. <BR> <BR>Now to figure out my next book purchase...

  body: 'I have been referring to Mr Bringhurst&#39;s book for some time &#40;the
    first edition: should one upgrade, as with software?&#41; It is very useful, but
    occasionally gets me into trouble. <BR> <BR>His advice to &#34;omit unnecessary
    punctuation&#34; is at odds &#40;as he admits&#41; with standard practice in North
    America for &#34;Mr., Mrs., and Ms.&#34; My attempts at reform have, without exception,
    been met with derision from editors and clients. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the practice
    for periods after Mr, Ms and Mrs in other English-speaking parts of the world?'

  body: BBC style is to eliminate punctuation after abbreviated titles and to turn
    &#34;pronounced&#34; acronyms &#40;Nasa, Aids&#41; into intial-cap nouns. It seems
    very clean to me.

    I&#39;ve converted multiple people to comic reading with that book &#40;I assume
    we&#39;re both talking about <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=1BMKGJRZ6V&amp;isbn=0930289234&amp;itm=1">Alan
    Moore and Dave Gibbons&#39;</a> graphic novel.&#41; <BR> <BR>I too have <i>Elements</i>
    at my desk at all times, but it&#39;s the earlier version. I&#39;d also like to
    know if an upgrade is worth it.'

  body: Yup, that&#39;s the same Watchmen. BTW, there&#39;s a movie of it in the works.
    See <a href="http://www.efavata.com/CBM/Watchmen.htm" target="_blank">http://www.efavata.com/CBM/Watchmen.htm</a>
    <BR> <BR>I think the second edition of Elements has plenty of nice improvements
    &#40;and a few corrections&#41;, but at this point I&#39;d probably hold out for
    the next version. Two weeks ago Bringhurst told me he was &#34;finishing up&#34;
    the third edition, so I&#39;m thinking it will be just a few months. <BR> <BR>On
    a side note, of all the business/technology books I&#39;ve read, <i>Information
    Rules</i> is the most interesting, readable, solidly thought out and well-grounded.
    It is to the business strategy and economics of high tech and software what <i>Elements</i>
    is to typography. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    a typeface, and even a big book on caligraphy. now if can just find a good pen
    set to start experimenting with... i love elements. i&#39;m about trough with

    a model that combines a good balance of affordability / features?&#41; Ditto sigh...
    <BR> <BR>&#34;Alyce you should add your reviews to the library.&#34; Thanks for
    the suggestion, Tiffany. Let me spend some time with the books and CDs and I&#39;ll
    come up with something better than &#34;much fonty goodness&#34;. Being a realist,
    however, I don&#39;t expect to match the eloquence of the existing <a href="http://www.typophile.com/books/archives/1%20Type%20Specimens.html#000055"

  body: The Canon Digital Rebels are looking VERY good. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a prosumer
    SLR for just under 1000 dollars.  6 megapixels; very good quality images.  I&#39;ve
    heard nothing but raves about them, and know someone who has one who loves it.
    <BR> <BR>If I had the money to buy one right now I&#39;d go for it.
