    worked with Henry Van de Velde. He was born in 1865 in Schaerbeek, and worked
    as a painter and designer. He died in 1916 in Ukkel. Creator of Argos (1908, W.
    Drugulin, an art nouveau alphabet).\r\n\r\nFor a free digital version, see [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/mueller/a_f.htm|Rick
    Mueller's Argos]]. For a commercial digital version, see David Nalle's [[http://luc.devroye.org/DavidNalle-Bucephalus-1993.gif|Bucephalus]]
    (1993). Dan Solo calls it Argos George. Berthold AG's phototype collection has
    it as Georges Lemon. However, the original name, according to Klingspor, is George-Lemmen-Schrift.

    I had to Google \"Argos\" to get a free version, because the one on that page
    you linked to wasn't any good, but it is almost exactly the same.\r\n\r\nThank
    you :)"
