body: "I've been looking for a new standard issue font to compliment my title fonts
  in presentations and I chanced upon Andalus.  I looked at the sample, loved it,
  and switched my default to it immediately.  Then, I looked it up on the Microsoft
  site for some information on it and discovered that it SHOULD display as an Arabic
  font.  So, now the question is:  on my computer it displays as western characters.
  \ Am I looking at the western character version of Andalus?  Or am I looking at
  a font that my computer defaults to when I write with Andalus because I don't have
  the language package installed?  How do I determine what it's defaulting to, if
  this is the case?  I've attached a screen capture here in hopes of figuring this
  out.\r\n\r\nNew to this..any help is much appreciated![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Andalus_5477.gif]"
