body: What are your opinions on using kerning of tabular figures instead of adding
  proportional figures? That way the user could easily make figures tabular by turning
  kerning off, or proportional by turning it on.

    than just applying a feature (or changing font style)?\r\n\r\nIMO, good tabular
    figures are more than just proportional figures with the same set width."

    just tabular figures with different set widths?\r\nIn fonts I've examined, the
    outlines of tabular and proportional figures (both lining and oldstyle) are exactly
    the same, with the exception of the 1 (sometimes!). Seems to me that it makes
    more sense to add kerning to tabular figures rather than duplicate 10 or 20 glyphs,
    when I feel like my tabular figure outlines will also work adequately in a proportional
    setting.\r\nWould it be possible to put a proportional figure 1 only into the
    proportional figures feature, along with the kerning? can you even put kerning
    into a feature other than the kern feature?"

    and only \u201Cone\u201D and \u201Cseven\u201D (and sometimes \u201Czero\u201D
    in oldstyle) glyphs in the proportional features, kerned. (Kerning occurs between
    glyphs, irrespective of whatever feature they are in.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I\u2019ve
    done several typefaces where most, if not all, of the tabular and proportional
    figures have different glyphs.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t work to rely
    on users to turn kerning off/on\u2014nobody reads the manual!\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThe
    worst thing is, many users\u2014I hesitate to call them typographers\u2014apply
    Optical Kerning as their default. Aaaaagh!!!!"

  body: "In addition to what Kent wrote: Keep in mind that tabular figures are rarely
    activated on an inline level, but typically are applied to the whole document,
    or at least to whole blocks like tables (manually or via paragraph styles). These
    blocks also include characters other than figures. You don\u2019t want to lose
    the kerning for those other strings. Granted, in sophisticated applications, savvy
    users could tinker with GREP styles to address the figures only. Still, it is
    not easier, but harder."

  body: "How do you think we did it back in the old days with photocomp? It was a
    pain in the posterior then, and it still would be.\r\n\r\n& by the way, when I
    go into fonts and set them up for actual use, most proportional figures do not
    keep the same width as the tabular. As Nick says, there are exceptions, depending
    on the original design.\r\n\r\nAll you're seeing is laziness. Fonts used for setting
    text should have both tabular and proportional figures, & probably in each of
    old style and lining. Fonts for setting display don't need tabular at all, right?"
