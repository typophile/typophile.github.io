  body: 'Nonono, not a cheap Clarendon copy, please don&#39;t say that! <BR> <BR>Egiziano
    is the digital version of an 1815 &#40;!&#41; typeface  <BR>by <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/person/figgins/vincent/"
    target="_blank"> Vincent Figgins</a> &#40;b. 1766, d. 29|2|1844&#41;, an English  <BR>type
    founder. He trained at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/person/jackson/joseph/"
    target="_blank"> Joseph Jackson</a>&#39;s type foundry  <BR>in London, and founded
    in 1972 a type foundry which existed  <BR>until 1908. It&#39;s in 1815 that he
    published a book of type  <BR>specimens, <i>the first</i> to depict typefaces
    &#40;labeled &#34;Antiques&#34;&#41; <BR>which later became known as slab-serif
    typefaces. <BR> <BR>So you could argue it actually is the other way around, as  <BR>Egiziano
    predates Clarendon by <i>138 years!</i> <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re planning to use
    Egiziano: the best digital  <BR>reinterpretation of a Figgins slab-serif is <a

    opinion you should never apologize for  <BR>something you simply don&#39;t know.
    Sorry if I came  <BR>across all patronizing. Glad I could help you out! <BR><IMG

  body: The Craw Clarendon family of types was a huge success when made available
    to North American printers in the mid fifties. I loved it dearly, particulary
    in the bold weight.   <BR> <BR>It was a revelation to me years later to see that
    this type of letter was common in the newspaper file copies of The Columbian.
    &#40;This paper was begun in New Westminster just prior to the start of the American
    Civil War&#41;. The Clarendon-type faces were available it seems in quite a few
    variants of weight and width, in both metal and woodtype.  <BR> <BR>Egizio is
    was another inspiration, made in metal after WW2 by the Nebiolo of Italy, and
    was also available in medium and bold with accompanying italic. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer
