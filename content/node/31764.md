  to have embossed at the printer, do i need to make it slightly bigger than the original
  shape on screen?\r\n\r\nI'm asking because this is going to get embossed OUTward
  and the shape has a cover, will this not effect on screen shape a bit? knowing that
  its going to nudge it outwards "

  body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nStrange that you have to supply a seperate file with the
    embossing, I usually just set the embossing area in a certain colour and then
    include a little 'Read me' file with the doc, explaining that this colour represents
    the embossing. \r\n\r\nAnyway, back to your question. WHen you say embossing outwards,
    its call de-bossing, just for future reference. You shouldnt have to make the
    embossing area bigger. With embossing it is a case of getting wet proofs done,
    each type of paper has different quilities, different embossing qualitites and
    so only viewing the actual print will be the only real way of certifying this.
    \r\n\r\nYou can always talk to your printer, and explain your situation, I am
    sure they can adcise you on what is best, they should know what to do. \r\n\r\nMatt"

    in your job and the printer will get what he needs in separation.  The best advice
    when working with your printer is to talk to him though.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
