  the symptoms of typoholics.\r\n\r\nit's actually a twitter app that searches for
  the hashtag #typoholism and posts it on the site. just post a tweet with that hashtag
  and it will appear on the site\r\n\r\nsome examples:\r\ntaking pictures of comic
  sans menus in fancy restaurants\r\nif you plan on picking your child's name based
  on how easy it is to kern\r\nObsessive use of the Baskerville ampersand\r\n\r\nAnyways,
  I thought everyone here might enjoy this little app"

    on, fix the audio issues, and hopefully continue expand our design and type knowledge
    so we can have more interesting conversations.
