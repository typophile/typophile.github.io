    I guess when you have a sure sell item, you don't need to hire a designer--just
    have your clerk type it out in Word (with kerning turned by default off of course)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    town is full of ugly dust jackets that would make a designer weep, because the
    publishers know that these books only sell to policy wonks and political junkies
    who really couldn't care less about the jackets anyway. Bob Woodward certainly
    deserves better, but for yet another political book in the endless stream that
    the current political climate engenders, it's really not all that bad."

  body: I believe it's bad by any standard. Kerning is to typography what grammar
    is to writing. A certain minimal standard in non-negotiable. Again, this may not
    be the real cover - may be a hastily done gif.

  body: "James,\r\nThere is a far broader market than our DC beltway Blackberry addicts
    for that kind of book and the publisher knows it is not a point-of-purchase sale
    issue.  It will sell purely on title and author.  The publisher probably thinks
    this might be the next \"All the Presidents Men\" best seller. Therefore, no need
    to throw money away on a cover design worthy of print. It is just a cheap way
    out and they don't care about the small number of type-savvy readers who probably
    would never buy it anyway.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Schlock in schlock out. To me the galling thing is that people who ought
    to know better, look the other way, this is not just in books, but in a lot of
    printed material. The fact that more people buy and use type than any other time
    does not mean any more are doing it better than earlier periods. To me there will
    always be a highend market that will use type amazingly well, but then there is
    now a separation where there used to be a middle ground of designers who used
    type well enough, if not  a little dull. It used to be easy, they looked at the
    galley of type and then they either politely called or screamed for changes to
    their liking. When the responsibilty changed to them doing the grunt work, well
    the common thinking seems to be \"good enough from my house.\" This is where we
    are at and why book covers like this look like, well, schlock.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    Truth shall set you free"

    poorly but forget how to punctuate too.  :-P\r\n\r\nRodrigue:  You make a good
    point, and one that I'm sure many of us have raised with our clients (and in some
    cases, former clients!).  \r\n\r\nFor example, our local transit authority has
    an on-going campaign about what is kewl on the system (i.e., don't crowd doorways,
    use earphones for your iPod, etc.) -- one of the posters deals with \"Appropriate
    Behavior.\"  However, they have used the word \"behaviour\" three times in it
    -- once spelled with the \"u\", the other two without.\r\n\r\nNow given that the
    City standard is British spelling (we are in Canada, after all), and the illustration
    has \"City Center\" in it (and the signage on the train platforms is \"City Centre\"),
    one has to wonder who designed this project and who approved it up the line. \r\n\r\nI
    emailed them a note about this just before Christmas last year, and while I notice
    there are a few new ones up with proper (and consistent) spellings, you still
    see a lot of the \"wrong\" ones around.\r\n\r\nEvery time I see one, I want to
    have a \"Billy Jack\" moment.....\r\n\r\nLinda"
