  (SECAC). These craft and trades folk range in age from 21 to 96 and live in south
  Louisiana in an area flanked by Pineville to the north, Thibodaux to the south west
  and Covington to the east including Baton Rouge and New Orleans. \r\n\r\nThis is

  body: "hi james,\r\n\r\nwas cracking-up a good thing?  it really is in the introduction
    to the book and was confirmed at the SECAC conference where it was aired.\r\n\r\nits
    interesting to try to figure out who includes and excludes what and on what criteria.\r\n\r\nthanks
    for looking."
