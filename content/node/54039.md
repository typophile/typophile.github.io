    is now my primary source of type design discussion, and it is usually the first
    place that I hear any new information or gossip.\r\n\r\nBut I still love Typophile,
    and my time here on the site hasn't let up despite my Twitter upkick."

  body: yeah i think it's a mix... for me twitter/FB are great for news and quick
    stuff, or sharing links etc, but typophile still wins for proper discussion.
