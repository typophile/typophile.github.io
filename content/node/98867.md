body: I come across typefaces such as Trade Gothic yet it is a sans-serif. There's
  obviously a difference between that and blackletter so what am I misunderstanding?

  body: "Gothic is an older term for sans-serif that is still commonly used in East
    Asian typography. More information can be found on the Wikipedia pages:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_gothic_typeface\r\n\r\nApparently,
    <cite>\"In English, Gothic is an outmoded typographic term for sans-serif. It
    was so named because the type color of early sans serif typefaces was thought
    to be similar to that of the blackletter or \u201Cgothic\u201D script. The term
    \u201Cgothic\u201D is now rare in English, having been largely replaced by \"sans-serif\"
    except in the names of some typefaces such as \"Century Gothic\".\"</cite>"

    Gothic, News Gothic, Trade Gothic, Century Gothic and more recently my Brown Gothic
    \u2026 and Gotham.\r\n\r\nHowever, perhaps due to the international nature of
    the present day font market, we now mostly refer to \u201Csans serif\u201D types,
    if not those that are speci\uFB01cally \u201Cgrotesque\u201D."

    the name for Batman's city, or 130 years earlier when Washington Irving used it
    as a nickname for NYC.

    it was associated with New York, and the style of the typeface was based on lettering
    commonly found on the city's buildings. So if there was a pun involved, it wasn't
    intended.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_history.php?historyItemID=1&productLineID=100008|H&FJ's

    \r\nJonathan and Tobias are quite eloquent chaps y\u2019know.\r\nI wouldn\u2019t
    put it past them to come up with a multi-meaninged typeface name. \r\nJonathan
    has written some quite erudite essays, for instance \u201COn Classifying Type\u201D
    for<em> Emigre</em> magazine, and Tobias wrote many of the very witty specimen
    texts for the Font Bureau when he was there, if I\u2019m not mistaken."
