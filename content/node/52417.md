  my girlfriend thought was wierd and it's exactly these I wanted to show you. As
  you can guess, they are type-related.\r\n\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/goransoderstrom/sets/72157610802315634/\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: Nice! Thanks for sharing these. I was in Kolkata, India, myself in 2002 and
    only wish I had the affinity for type the way I do now. The very limited signage
    I did photograph is so beautiful; so much is done so well by hand. I hope you
    enjoyed your trip. India is an amazing experience.
