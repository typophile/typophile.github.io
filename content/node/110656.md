body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nthis logo is meant for a small consultancy that does intercultural
  trainings, for example for Indian businessmen who come to Germany and want to understand
  people and culture. \r\n\r\nThe claim means \"Global Mediators\" and the logo consists
  of the first names of the two consultants. The visual idea is that of \"connecting\"
  cultures. However I already got the feedback that this metaphor is 1, recognized
  very hard and late visually and 2, that it is too abstract and theoretical.\r\n\r\nThe
  logo is based on an \"Aller\" but heavily modified. The claim is a \"Andada\".\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?\r\nThanks for your feedback!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bildschirmfoto

    I would have expected! To me it's the right degree of subtle. It just needs polish.\r\n\r\nBTW
    I would avoid that Italic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "> it is too abstract and theoretical\r\n\r\nThe image of two people shaking
    hands was immediately obvious to me.  Letters have been used to represent people
    in logos for a long time.  The \"Families\" logo below was designed over 30 years
    ago, and we still see the concept used a lot today. \r\n\r\nIf you're worried
    about people not recognizing it, one thought would be to use photos of shaking
    hands in some of the company's literature (although that image is a bit of a cliche).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/families_6573.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks for your feedback! It's such a delight that the concept seems to work.\r\n\r\n@hrant:
    Yes, the italic looks weird. I wonder what your ideas for polishing the logo would
    be. I would be thankful for any hint in this direction!\r\n\r\n@JamesM: Thanks
    for the reference and the good idea to support the idea with other visuals."

  body: "I have to admit I didn't see the two men shaking hands at first, but then
    I can be rather naive about these things. Now I've seen it I can't unsee it, and
    it's very clever. I find the icon to be aesthetically pleasing as well, and so
    is the color.\r\n\r\nI'm personally still concerned that the concept is too subtle,
    but then I also wonder if the concept even has to be obvious. The icon is pleasant
    to look at. I guess I agree it just needs some polishing."
