  and can get along with some script font type. Also, it can get along with photography/cc
  cover design (this is magazine spread project) \r\n\r\nI am quite bored using helvetica
  and universe :( \r\n\r\n"

  body: How modern should it be? When I hear modern, big and blocky I think of something
    like [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=18|Morgan Big]]. Too
    modern?

  body: "Thanks Florian :) thats really useful \r\n\r\nhn20, yeah tht's a bit too
    modern and a bit too urban fr me because the photographs are mostly fashion and
    the style is retro-modern photographs. \r\n ig its helping, most of the photographs
    style is like this site \r\nhttp://www.inqmnd.ca/ \r\nonly more fashion class
    and more clean-dramatic look.\r\n\r\nif you guys can suggest some script it will
    be awesome too because I only basic script on my computer and currently looking
    to buy some of good script. \r\n\r\n"
