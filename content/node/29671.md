body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm researching to find a nice modern ultra-condensed sans-serif
  to buy. Can you make any recommendations?\r\n\r\nI liked very much the face that
  was used in the old National Post magazine, Saturday Night. I have Univers, Helvetica,
  and Franklin Gothic, but they look quite old to me. I prefer something that is modern,
  elegant and has a consistent voice across the family.\r\n\r\nThank-you for your
  help!\r\n\r\n---"

  body: It would be nice if the font was readable at text weight for special uses,
    but I am mostly looking for a display face.
