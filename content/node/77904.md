  COVINGTON, LA--\r\n\r\nLast Thursday, January 6, in Jennifer Rice's Innisfree office
  at 729 East Boston Street in Covington, the inaugural meeting of the Louisiana Engravers
  Society met. This is a landmark event because engraving for print is almost a dead
  art. Nancy Sharon Collins of Covington and Yvette Rutledge of New Orleans have banded
  together to formalize the growing group of engraving enthusiasts whom they meet
  and who practice here in south Louisiana. Together, they have made it their mission
  to not only keep this venerable, exquisite art form alive but also encourage its
  growth by introducing it to younger generations. Highlights were meeting and networking,
  learning and sharing information and resources, especially sharing technical innovations.
  Sam Alfano demonstrated the work he has been doing creating digital translations
  of ornate engraved scroll designs, a process that took him three years to perfect
  (you can see some on his website.)\r\n\r\nEngraving is the most beautiful form of
  printing known; think of Old Masters prints, those portraits and landscapes made-up
  of thousands of tiny lines, that's engraving. Albrecht D\xFCrer was a master engraver,
  Raphael and Rubens allowed master engravers to copy their work thus increasing the
  market for their famous paintings. While etching has come to be the prevalent form
  of intaglio printing practiced in the fine art, printmaking world, engraving has
  fallen out of favor because it takes 6-10 years to become a master! (The difference
  between etching and engraving is that in etching, acid is used to make the \u201Ccut\u201D
  while engravers literally cut into the surface of the metal to form designs. The
  similarity is that the printing process is then the same; ink is worked into the
  \u201Ccuts\u201D. the excess wiped clean, and a print then pulled. Several etching
  artists are represented at the St. Tammany Art Association where their work can
  be seen). These days, engraving is best known on the currency carried in our wallets,
  all our postage stamps used to be engraved, and fancy social stationery and wedding
  invitations are still engraved. However, we have master engravers right here in
  our community and several students locally who want to learn. \r\n\r\nParticipants
  included Yvette Rutledge and Vince Mitchell, co-directors of the New Orleans Center
  for Lettering Arts and Mystic Blue Signs (Rutledge is herself a master letter and
  engraver), Nancy Sharon Collins, bespoke hand engraved social stationer (who also
  teaches graphic design at SELU), the Alfonos (Sam is a master gun and jewelry engraver),
  Cordelle Louvier, master printer, Emily DeLorge (graphic designer and engraving
  apprentice) and Skye Jenkins and Alex Babbit (enthusiastic students wanting to learn.)
  Noel Martin, local master stationery engraver, was unable to attend at the last
  minute but was present in spirit. Alfono offers engraving classes for jewelry engraving
  and Rutledge will be offering an engraving class for print, jewelry and metal work
  this coming fall.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nancysharoncollinsstationer.com/\r\nwww.mysticbluesigns.com\r\nhttp://www.masterengraver.com/\r\nhttp://www.jenniferrice.net/\r\nphoto:
