    want it reversed?\r\nMaybe something more round - like Clarendon."

    What you've got in your sample is a single left quote mark, not an apostrophe.
    An apostrophe is the same as a single right quote mark. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    we see this mistake frequently due to the simplemindedness of desktop publishing
    software, which can't tell the difference between the beginning of a quoted passage
    and a contraction. So much for \"smart\" quotes."

  body: Traditionally, what you want is a "turned comma." An apostrophe is a "raised
    comma." The "reversed apostrophe" or "reversed quote" is yet a different character
    -- see the Unicode General punctuation range, I forget the Unicode number. The
    Lakeside Press use to use reversed quotes & double quotes in a series they published
    -- <cite>Tom Horn</cite> used them for sure.

  body: No, Mark, for publications in North America you are correct, not only in your
    assessment of what is the current state and what the appropriate replacement should
    be, but also in how it got there.

  body: "\"is the regular apostrophe the correct usage in this case?\"\r\n\r\nYes,
    and here's why: because in this case, the apostrophe indicates <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Apostrophe_showing_omission\">an
    omission</a>. Which is why the apostrophe is in \"here's\", which is a truncated
    version of \"here is\" which omits the space and i.\r\n\r\nIn your case, the apostrophe
    indicates the omitted 20.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Mark, you're right. I got so caught up in the naming convention, I forgot
    the original problem.\r\n\r\nI do think the naming conventions have some importance,
    perhaps less so  in this instance, but rather more when the marks are used in
    phonetics . . .esp. since some web sites use the 'straight-up-and-down\" mark
    for an 'apostrophe,' which leads to yet more confusion. "
