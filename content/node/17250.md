body: "I am working on a textbook which had a few mathematical fractions and equations
  in it - such as a bracketed fraction multiplied by another fraction etc. I am finding
  this quite difficult.. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone had any advice on creating
  nut fractions in particular and any general tips in Indesign CS.  I don't have Indesign
  CS 2, apparently it makes things easier for numerical data.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n-Cheryl

    good bit of tweaking (baselines, etc.)... Especially if you don't want to use
    Times.\r\n\r\nI've been longing for a sans version of Symbol for ages now, I might
    just have to make it myself.\r\n\r\n--Michael.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n//
