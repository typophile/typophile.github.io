body: Hey all, I'm curious to see the differing opinions on what you think are the
  best typefaces for wayfinding/information signage. Also, why is it (or why are they)
  the best? Flaring? Immediate character recognition? Open characters? Let's hear
  some viewpoints.

  body: "For people on foot, or bicycle, you can use just about any typeface, sans
    or serif, upper and lower case or all caps. A good designer will make it work,
    choosing the right weight, size, spacing, leading, colour, layout, etc.\r\n\r\nOnly
    cars and the absurd speed at which they travel make \"optimum\" typefaces a necessity
    for certain kinds of highway sign.\r\n\r\nIt's important to have a bit of local
    personality, rather than just use a generic utilitarian sans, because these give
    an impersonal quality to public space, which makes it unloved and unsafe."

    for the next SxSW show?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the same principles apply to readability
    for signage as they do for fine print. The principles are largely the same, but
    the execution (how they're implemented) will vary."

  body: "I agree with Nick that most typefaces can be used for wayfinding signage,
    and that as he said it`s important to avoid arbitrarily using a generic utilitarian
    sans.\r\n\r\nI just would that that altough most typefaces can be used, not all
    will be appropriate for the specific needs of each project. Some of this factors
    could be important enough to be accounted in the type selection of a project:
    the visual and perceptual characteristics of your audience, the environmental
    noise, visualization distances and conditions, the material and production technique
    of the signals among others.\r\n\r\nI personally find hard to read signs set in
    sans serif faces with very enclosed counters such as Helv\xE9tica at certain lenght
    of distance (bad eyesight), also all caps I find more difficult at the distance.\r\n\r\nI
    have found ITC Garamond as well as other roman faces with lower contrast and large
    x height to work fine in signage because faces like Times with too much contast
    tend to get fuzzier from far.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: "Nick has said it already, but I'll go ahead and put a fine point on it: To
    be effective, a wayfinding system depends on consistency, sign location, distinctiveness
    of color, contrast, layout, etc. and on expert spacing of type and other typographic
    details. The typeface choice will only go so far to bring cohesion; without attention
    to the arrangement and application of the typeface, it can't do the whole job.
    In fact, the usefulness of a typeface can be destroyed or minimized by bad application.
    Develop a strong system, and you'll find that almost any typeface can be plugged
    into it.\r\n\r\nIf you are lucky, there will be an excellent typeface waiting
    for you:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.yale.edu/printer/typeface/typeface.html"

    presents some intelligent insight into wayfinding signage. From Ralf Herrmann.

  body: "Ralf's blurry tool is interesting, but until you bring it all outside and
    take a look at it from down the road under real-world conditions, you cannot predict
    how the any of it will perform. \r\n\r\nWhat type and grad of retro-reflective
    material is the simulation based on?\r\n\r\nBelieve me there is a big difference
    between computer simulations and a real sign mounted at the proper height with
    headlights shining on it from 600+ feet.\r\n\r\n"
