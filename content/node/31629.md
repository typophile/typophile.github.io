body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nThis is a display typeface I did while attending the
  Icograda International Design Workshop for Students held at IDC, Mumbai. The workshop
  theme was \"Design Local\". It was not complete but now I really want to move further
  on this. Your feedback would be really helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\nInspiration: A Window
  from the ticket counter at Mumbai Railway Station.\r\n\\\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Inspiration_4952.jpg]\r\n\\\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1

  body: "I like this very much.  Some things I would change:\r\n\r\nThe E looks too
    much like Greek capital Sigma (\u03A3).  I would try matching the middle horizontals
    in the E and F with the horizontal in the H instead.  Similarly, I would make
    the left-hand vertical of the K match the left-hand vertical of the H.\r\n\r\nI
    also think the bottom of the U is very unsettling.  Why can't it look like the
    bottom of the O? \r\n\r\n-m"
