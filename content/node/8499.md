  body: If you&#39;re talking about templates for common document types  <BR>&#40;CD
    jackets, business cards, etc.&#41; then Illustrator comes with a <BR>good set.
    <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re talking about templates that show you margins,  <BR>columns,
    gutters, etc. then you may have better luck using them  <BR>as guidelines or principles
    to follow, and not rigid formulas or  <BR>templates.

  body: I would recomend reading Muller-Brockmann&#39;s book &#34;Grid Systems Raster
    Systems&#34; for info on the highly structured end of grids.  Then I would just
    move some block shapes around on a blank piece of paper to try to learn visual
    relationships with no grid at all.  The two experiences together will give you
    a basis for getting something to use in comparison. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    magazine to &#34;try <BR>them out&#34;. just a quick way to put in the same <BR>content
    into different grids and see for myself which direction to go.
