  body: "No, this certainly is from <a href=\"http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/\">S\xFCddeutsche
    Zeitung Magazin</a>, right?\r\n(Always mention your source, David! :\xB0)\r\nThis
    Munich based newspaper has had this distinctive nameplate (<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/31857\">discussed
    </a> here <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/33764\">previously</a>) for
    more than 60 years now.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sz_6663.png]\r\nA
    few years ago, the letterforms of that lettered nameplate were turned into a font,
    missing characters were added. I once read about that, but unfortunately forgot
    who had done it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/\">SZM</a>
    is a weekly supplement to the paper. <a href=\"http://www.mirkoborsche.com/\">Mirko
    Borsche</a> used to be its art director for the last three years \u2026 I don\u2019t
    know if he was involved.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typeforum.de/modules.php?op=modload&name=XForum&file=viewthread&tid=451\">Typeforum.de</a>
    doesn\u2019t know either \u2026 guess it\u2019s time to ask directly."

    could be the sueddeutsche type.\r\n\r\nI think it's part of a redesign of the
    jetzt magazin (found it on the portfolio website of mirko borsche (http://www.mirkoborsche.com/
    -> work, jetzt II)"
