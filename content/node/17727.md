body: "This new screen-based keyboard is ingenius. It's fully contextual for each
  application, but more importantly allows the user to set the language on the fly,
  as there is a small screen behind every key. Curious what you multi-lingual designers
  think of this. It doesn't hurt that it's beautiful.\r\n\r\nAs an observation, it's
  interesting that this came from a Russian firm where they're probably tired of a
  Latin-centric QWERTY world.\r\n\r\nI wonder what the possibilities are for languages
  like Chinese with enormous character sets.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.artlebedev.com/portfolio/optimus/\r\n\r\nThanks
  Jen Panasik for the link."

    in the initial stage of production.\r\nWe hope it will be released in 2006.\r\nIt
    will cost less than a good mobile phone.\r\nIt will be real.\r\nIt will be OS-independent
    (at least it\u2019s going to be able to work in some default state with any OS).\r\nIt
    will support any language or layout.\r\nMoscow is the capital of Russia.\r\nEach
    key could be programmed to produce any sequence.\r\nIt will be an open-source
    keyboard, SDK will be available.\r\nSome day it will be split (and made \u201Cergonomic\u201D).\r\nIt
    will most likely use the OLED technology (e-paper is sooo slow).\r\nOur studio
    is located two blocks from the Kremlin.\r\nIt will feature a key-saver.\r\nKeys
    could be animated when needed.\r\nIt has a numeric keypad because we love it.\r\nThere\u2019s
    no snow in Moscow in summer.\r\nIt will be available worldwide (why not?) \"\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"
