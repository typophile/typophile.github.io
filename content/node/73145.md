  for the use in the logo (all caps) they look pretty similar. Aside from very slight
  stylistic things, the main differences I can see is that Gotham has 8 weights instead
  of 7, and Proxima comes with small caps.\r\n\r\nBeen thinking about this for a while
  (I don't buy big font familiess that often) and I am having a really hard time deciding.\r\n\r\nHelp!"

    becoming a favorite of hacks who just slap together low-budget work with templates
    and popular fonts. I\u2019m seeing a lot of it in drug store signage and store-brand
    products. Not something clients are going to want to be associated with."

    noticed that they've got different uppercase \"M\"s as well... I think I prefer
    Gotham's... but it's hard to make a choice like this based on one letter.\r\n\r\nWhen
    will H&FJ fonts be web-friendly?  Seems like they're the last to get on board."

    gettin\u2019 there on that one. Another contemporary geometric (although not so
    strict) is [[http://www.vllg.com/Village/Galaxie_Polaris#panel=poster|Galaxie
    Polaris]], and a typeface I find very interesting is the grotesque-geometric gap
    bridging in [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik|Graphik]]."

  body: "I know I'm late to this party -- and the votes have been unanimous -- but
    the other positive thing I would say about Proxima Nova is that it has more sparkle
    and detail at display sizes. Gotham is so even that at larger sizes it looks a
    bit dull and monotonous. (I've seen companies adopt Gotham for their identity,
    and suddenly things are looking bland, bland, bland.)\r\n\r\nI think Proxima is
    a font for a lifetime. Like all H+FJ retail products (with the possible exception
    of \"Fetish No. 338\"), Gotham was built to stick around, too. But I suspect designers
    will find objections to it based on how it's being (over)used, like those James
    \"Dunwich Type\" Puckett mentions above. Perhaps Gotham is Tobias Frere-Jones's
    second Interstate, a great face that's used too much and poorly.\r\n\r\nJames
    didn't make a plug for himself, so I'll do it. His family Armitage shares similar
    source material with Gotham (vernacular, non-typographic lettering from buildings),
    has a lot of nice detailing, and it's available for print and web licensing."
