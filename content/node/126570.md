body: I'm desperate to find this font, which is perfect for a client branding project
  and I'm having no luck finding it. Are there any font wizards in here that recognise
  what it is? I've found plenty of similar serif stencil fonts but nothing quite as
  lovely - I'm particularly in love with the flow of the N. Thanks in advance for
  any help!

    body: Thank you for trying! What I'm struggling with is finding a similar N, where
      it curves. I could create it in illustrator but I was hoping my client could
      use it as a font. Thanks again, I'll keep looking through the font list you
      send :)
