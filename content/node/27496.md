    a vector file and has made this in paintshop. the N and Y are too close to each
    other and the first triangle does not connect to the second one again\r\noverall
    it seems to be the design that i think i am going with and i gave him a partial
    payment for the use of the idea and the design. i do not think that i have lost
    too much since i have found a design that can work for me.now i guess i have to
    try to get this in a vector format i downloaded a copy of inkscape so i just have
    to learn a little or maybe get someone to do it \r\nby the way before i lost the
    last topic someone suggested this. it looks nice but i think is too heavy for
    the site what do you think [img:sites/default/files/old-images/horizontal_5438_6357.jpg]\r\nthank
    you very much for all the help"

    solution than the other's were. IMHO, of course.\r\n"

  body: "I really did not want to get into the experiments that I did with the two
    colors but here we go.\r\nI also noticed the extensive use of these colors by
    other big retailers like sears \r\nI started experimenting in my own store I painted
    one of the walls in the light green and noticed that people generally stayed longer
    in my store specially women. I added a large orange design on one of the walls.
    I had a 5% increase in sales in that section it seems that the green makes the
    people more relaxed and orange helps them to make decision easier\r\nnow i am
    not a college grad but I had been in sales for 20 years and have learned that
    a lot of small things add up to big success for example we used to cover the floor
    of the store with shredded newspaper to look busier.Color has more benefit than
    just design. \r\nSo when I started with this concept I decided to use these colors\r\nnow
    if some one can point to a couple of fonts that i can use for my logo to get a
    nice clean fresh design please point me to it \r\nalso what do you think about
    the little ilustration rather than stock photo"

    was on Boingboing, sneaky retailers, the tiles trick is particularly creative.\r\n\r\nHasn't
    your logo changed since you first posted that revision? I thought I saw it with
    the crown on the left and without the mysterious (read superfluous and ambiguous)
    swoosh under it. The illustration isn't bad, although the hand (always a difficult
    thing to draw) is not very well rendered and the pizza looks as though it has
    green and yellow jellybeans on it and the salami seems more detailed than the
    rest of the illustration, if it possible to tone down those areas it might improve
    it, however if you can't it is serviceable. I really wouldn't use the earlier
    iteration of the logo in the find restaurant column.\r\n\r\nAs you know from the
    first thread I think the decision over avoiding the obvious colours was correct.
    What are you looking for from a new font, which areas do you want to use it \u2013
    the sans and serif you are using are fairly well matched although the weights
    and sizes in the welcome section need some rationalisation.\r\nTim"

  body: "And there goes the logo again:)\r\nIt is kind of tricky to keep track of
    your logo iterations, the crown in the current one is not working as a unit with
    the lettering, either centre on the stem of P or centre on the width of P. Toning
    down the colours of the illustration have improved it and the icons are far better
    than the recycled logo. On the copy in your site I recommend you look at the periods
    a lot of them have spaces before and not every abbreviation of Ave or St has one.\r\nTim"

    the green a little more silvery, and the orange a bit more burnt. The new logo

    I'd align the centre spike with the centre of the counter of the 'P' (a little
    to the left of where it is now). The vertical placement in version 3 looks the
