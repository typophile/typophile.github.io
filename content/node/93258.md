  both since the other one is P22 Sweepy and both of them are featured in the book
  Typosphere, however the book only talks about Sweepy and does not say anything about
  the other one.\r\n\r\nIn case it helps, the designer for Sweepy was Michael Clark."

    sample is calligraphy, not a font.\r\nBy the way, you should post on the main
    Type ID Board, not in the Solved IDs section."
