body: "I realized a few weeks ago that I like to display quantitative information
  visually more than I like finding the quantitative information to display.\r\n\r\nFortunately,
  I have access to decades of theses from a large research university from which I
  can take interesting information. I'll probably start presenting the findings of
  some of these in a monthly student art magazine.\r\n\r\nBut, considering that I'm
  at a large research university, I figure that some current research units here could
  use me. Most could probably use help with cleaning up details of the generic types
  of graphs and tables, but I'm really interested in more complicated, unconventional
  information, and groups with simpler information probably wouldn't want my help
  anyway if the changes would be so small.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have ideas about how
  I may find groups that regularly have trouble presenting quantitative data visually
  or whether such groups even exist? I suspect certain disciplines may be more prone
  to this trouble than others."

  body: "I'm looking for specific groups at my school whose offices I could walk into
    and whom I could convince that they need me to display their data. I was looking
    for larger trends that might help me find specific groups at school.\r\n\r\nTufte
    looks takes specific examples from all over the world and then some (http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/graphics/poster_cyclogram_big.gif).
    I don't think very explicitly mentions which fields tend to have more trouble
    than others.\r\n\r\nBut I'll check again, and even if he doesn't generalize as
    to which fields have trouble, I can probably get a good idea from what he chooses
    to present."
