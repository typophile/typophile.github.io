  and I am preparing to write a report on typography. It is an open brief and so I
  can choose to write about anything within typography which I feel makes it all the
  harder to decide with such an interesting and wide variety of options. \r\n\r\nI
  am relatively new to typography and have spent the last few weeks looking into its
  general history. Now I feel I have a better understanding about what typography
  is and where it all began, I am ready to put an angle on my report and was looking
  at perhaps incorporating brands and how typography can affect a brand image - This
  is just one idea I have had and have found myself so overwhelmed that I am struggling
  to nail an actual idea. It seems the more I read the less able I feel to write a
  successful report! \r\n\r\nBest wishes \r\n\r\nKim \r\n"

- body: "Your head will explode if you try to narrow down one typeface and examine
    its usage in several brands. The opposite approach might be more effective. \r\n\r\nMight
    I suggest the topic of political candidates?  You might find the research easier
    if the branding is just for one person with clearly stated positions, rather than
    products with more nuanced messages. Plus, with politicians, you can definitively
    show which typeface \"won.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a wealth of information analyzing
    Barack Obama's smart choice of Gotham for his political campaign. McCain chose
    more safe, traditional (dull!) branding with a somewhat military-looking logo.
    \r\n\r\nJust a thought!\r\n\r\n"
