body: "I need some guidance on the Avenir typeface and I guess the Frutiger System:\r\n\r\nAn
  agency have mocked up some web designs for us using a non system standard font as
  a headline: Avenir Book 45.\r\n\r\nNot withstanding the issues of not being able
  to use it as live text, can I use '45' at variable sizes for print and if so is
  it a case of the layout package resizing it as obviously '45' should be of a fixed
  size and weight?\r\n\r\nThere's no way my company will shell out for the updated
  whole family (Avenir Next is \xA3850) If resizing Book 45 to big sizes for exhibition
  stands etc is not going to work, can anyone suggest a decent system font (apart
  from Helvetica and it's Knock-off Arial) that I could use instead and thus avoid
  all of these issues?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\n\r\nOwen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Relax! You can use 45 for what ever size you want. The number used in a font
    is a concatenation of two numbers. The first set defines weight, while the second
    defines width and position. The 45 refers to it's weight, width and style. 4 means
    it's light (or book), and 5 that it is of normal width, and 5 being an odd number
    that it is an upright (roman) design. If the second number is even, it's a oblique
    style.\r\n\r\nMore here: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univers]]"

  body: 'Thanks very much, got a bit bent up thinking that my layout packages were
    resizing it poorly like the bold feature in quark would do for some typefaces
    - what a muppet - unfortunately no-one here could tell me any different so thanks
    again. '

  body: 850 can seem like a lot for a full typeface family, but surely that's just
    a fraction of the cost of the entire trade shoe exhibit budget, no?
