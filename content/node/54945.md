    but helvetica?\r\nI'm very sorry if I\u2019m being dumb, or even offending anyone,
    but I never been able to get on with the font. It is beautifully simple, and it
    is probably this same reason that many people like it. But too me this attribute
    makes it is just a bit cold.\r\n\r\nStef\r\n"

    just doesn't do it for me. \r\n\r\nI do think there's a bit too much helvetica
    hoopla at the moment, but I basically still love it. "

  body: "Helvetica is someday going to incite war. First, Helvetica will become a
    religion, Helvetao, whose worshipers will spread the gospel of their messiah,
    Massimo Vignelli. The pinnacle of their belief system will be that only two typefaces
    be used in all communications materials: Helvetica and Bodoni. Their symbol will
    be the Helvetaoist H & Crossbones:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Symbol_h_5144.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey
    will insist that all other typefaces are unnecessary. \"There are too many typefaces,\"
    they will say. They may even quote Eric Gill, \"There are now about as many different
    varieties of letters as there are different kinds of fools.\" And they will do
    this all the while designing and producing new kinds of chairs, tea kettles, plates,
    saucers, flatware, etc. Yes, those items of which we so desperately need variety.\r\n\r\nThis
    reductive typographic ideology will spread rapidly until threee key figures launch
    an insurgency. David Carson, Marian Bantjes, and a small town hero, Joe the sign
    painter. Business signage set in Helvetica will be ripped down and retrofitted
    with Marian's custom flourishing letter forms. David will design recruitment posters
    set in Zapf Dingbats. \r\n\r\nHey, don't kill the messenger. Things are going
    to get heated. Websites like BanComicSans.com and BanPapyrus are just the beginning."

    We shall have to show the Helvetao that there is glory in un-conformity, that
    there is power in diversity and that there is no sin in serif. '
