body: "I have fallen in love with typefaces with the scribally influenced miniscule
  a's. They're not wimpy or weak at all, and the way they're squared off makes them
  seem rugged and virile to my eyes.\r\n\r\nThese types of lc a's seem to be prevalent
  particularly in [[garalde]] and [[venetian]] [[oldstyle]] typefaces, but  a few
  modern serifed fonts have used them as well. This seems to be a particular favorite
  form of [[Robert Slimbach]], as quite a few of his typefaces have this particular
  style of a.\r\n\r\n<strong>[[Nicholas Jenson]] types</strong>\r\nLTC Metropolitan

    I think. Then there''s Xavier Dupre''s Absara. Maybe even Weiss would qualify. '

  body: "One of the major book romans with that style <strong>a</strong> is Bembo,
    based on the type cut by Francesco Griffo for Aldus Manutius\u2019 1495 edition
    of De Aetna by Pietro Bembo in Venice. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bembo/\"
    target=\"_new\">Adobe make a good Bembo</a>\r\n\r\nHere's a picture:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/anotherbembo_5390.gif]\r\n\r\nCompare
    it to Adobe's and it becomes obvious the one I used here lacks authenticity, the
    bowl being too tall and not square enuff.\r\n\r\nAlso look at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/poliphilus/\"
    target=\"_new\">Monotype's Poliphilus</a>, used by Manutius to print the infamous
    Hypnerotomachia Polyphilus book of fantastic nonsense.\r\n\r\n<em>...the way they\u2019re
    squared off makes them seem rugged and virile to my eyes.</em>\r\n\r\nRigor, robustness,
    tension. The easiest way to get it is to make the curves and letter form squarish.
    Presently in some guises I guess it also goes by the name of \"hyperellipse\".\r\n\r\nj

  body: "That one is totally missing what I'm talking about. It's missing any evidence
    of a broad-nibbed pen or quill like the earlier examples. You can't see any evidence
    of the \"pulling\" of the nib toward the baseline, and the cross strokes being
    one straight movement of the pen.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I've seen quite a few
    sans-serif designs that I really love that have this same sort of feeling."

  body: I dunno. Minion has the lachrymal thing going on as well. Does anyone know
    how or where that fits into the evolution of type from the obviously broad-nib
    formed to what we have now.
