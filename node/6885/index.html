  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><b>Dear all</b>, <BR> <BR>I'm doing some research on newspaper typography, and right now I'm looking for what has been written on the subject. So far (only just started) I've found some very good articles written by <a href="http://www.linotype.com/7-411-7/andreacuteguumlrtler.html" target="_blank">Andr</div>

  
   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">Mr Lo-Fi at your service. <BR>I see you've already found the Gurtler stuff - that's primo. I didn't know about DTP though - could you tell me more about it? And how can I get a copy of the article in the second picture on that page? <BR> <BR>A major author to track down is Allen Hut: he's written 2 or 3 books on the topic as well as a number of articles in magazines. One of the articles was about Walter Tracy, who was also a newspaper man of sorts. Besides his book &quot;The Typographic Scene&quot;, he's written some articles, including one in Typographica and another in Interpressgrafic, which had an issue in 1971 with a couple of news type articles, the other being by Matthew Carter: a superb elaboration on the design of Olympian (which was a pretty groundbreaking design). The most recent work you should check out is John Berry's &quot;Contemporary Newspaper Typography&quot;. <BR> <BR>BTW, something important: as you seem to suspect, the separation of typography and overall design is dangerous. Although the more you broaden away from the type itself the less relevant things are to the type*, even things like the paper being tabloid or broadsheet** do affect the type. Basically, everything matters, even company politics - Roger Black's article in Berry's book about the LA Times is a prime example of that. <BR> <BR>* What I mean for example is that the column width is more relevant than the page size. <BR> <BR>** BTW, I have this Russian newspaper that actually mixes the formats: most of it is tabloid, but the innermost spread is made into a single broadsheet page! I was thinking that you could even make multiple inside pages that open the other direction. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
