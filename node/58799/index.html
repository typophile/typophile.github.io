Craigslist is also full of ads requesting logos for little or no money... I think that instead of concentrating on those kinds of ads, it's better to promote yourself and go after the kinds of clients that would be willing to pay for a well-made logo... or poster, or brochure, for that matter.</div>

I don't know anyone willing to work for free...even for student. Whether you like it or not they are real clients who are too cheap to pay for professional works. At the end of day they get what they pay for...which is amateurish works. If that is how much they value their companies so be it. Bottom line, the student who did work for them gained real life experience.</div>
