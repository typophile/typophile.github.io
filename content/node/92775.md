  body: "I was commenting on the ad, but I think the type is great too.\r\nI like
    the way it\u2019s conceived as tight-but-not-touching.\r\nOne nice thing about
    your work in general is that the glyphs are always very clear with regard to the
    characters they are representing. (Not always the case with new scripts, both
    new and old.) "
