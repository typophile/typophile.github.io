  Gentium font.\r\nFor copyright reasons, it is called GsmCaps for now.\r\n\r\nI also
  made a semi-sans serif version of Gentium, called GsemiSans.\r\n\r\nBoth were really
  learning processes for me, and I plan to use them for an upcoming project. I may
  submit them to SIL, I don't know yet.\r\n\r\nThanks for any comments and critisisms;
  I am a complete beginner, with no formal training.  But I just love typography!\r\n\r\nGentium

  me if the PDFs don't work for you, and I know one of the fonts is not serif, but
  I had to pick a forum.)"

  body: I think the pdf doesn't work. they both contain one page. On the upper part
    there are a few letters randomly spread.

  body: "Unfortunately, I believe I have lost the original semi sans font. The pdf
    is all that remains. I don't know if anything can be done with the pdf but I will
    keep looking for the original.\r\n\r\nA copy of the smallcaps font is <a href=\"http://samcooler.com/files/GsmCaps.ttf\">available</a>,
    probably with some bad kerning errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSam"

    the kerning though. \r\n\r\nHere I go reviving a thread, but if it helps . . . "

  body: There are 41 glyphs in GsemiSans.pdf (only a subset of your font). Let me
    know if you want to restore them. (I believe the font is Open and I can do it)
