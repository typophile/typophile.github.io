  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello All, <BR> <BR>I was just hired to redesign some forms for a healthcare group. Is there anywhere on the web I can look for some well-designed paper forms (they need not be healthcare related). I need some fresh inspiration or else these forms will turn out to be little more than new revisions of their dull predecesors. Also, if you'd like to throw some form-design advice my way, it will find its way between my ears. Cheers!</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">My advice would be to fill out your own form. I've seen way to many forms designed but clearly not actually USED by the designer to see if they could even be filled out. ;o)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd agree with Darrel. A good first step would be to take the forms which they currently use and fill them out to see where they fall short. After all, the information is the same, isn't it? Aside from that, I'm sure if you google for design + health care you've got to come up with something.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I can't give you any specifics, but I've always been attracted to forms that take into account visual entry and information grouping. This also creates opportunities to go beyond type and rules. <BR> <BR>Visual entry, how the person sees the form within the first second or two and sorts the visual data into information about how to use the form, is something that often gets overlooked. What's the at-a-glance impression? Then, start examining each bit individually and ask yourself what's really needed. Also, use a clear, open, and high-legibility font so you can use smaller type without fear. I agree with Darrel as well. <BR> <BR>And semi-related, check out <a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/005675.php">Airbag's redesign of an intellgence brief</a> to see how strong, simple, and <i>purposeful</i> visual hierarchy can inject a lot into a document that doesn't have much to begin with.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Darrell, I've already filled out the form, in fact my clients did as well but this was a great idea. Obviously great minds think alike. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> After doing that, we were able to make some choices about what can be eliminated and what should be added and better ways to organize the form. Chris, that's exactly the sort of thing I need. Fresh ideas on how to appproach data that has to be presented. I like the simple, but obviously well-designed form in the link. Do you have any more links like that? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">James, not only do forms need to work in the collection of data, but they also need to work in the extraction and entry of the data into some kind of database (presumabaly) or other persistent record. <BR> <BR>So part of your considerations should also be the workflow of the clerical task: what order does the software require the information in? Is the interface something that requires mouse clicks or is tabbing/shift-tabbing possible? Is the software changeable by you or a developer to improve this work? And if it's not going into a database in a computer perhaps the record book or file could benefit from your typographical design expertise as well. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jon,  <BR> <BR>The forms I'm designing are paper forms used to note patient data such as performance on an exercise stress test in order to aid a doctor in a diagnosis. When they're filled out, they will be added to the patient's chart. Unfortunately or (fortunately), most doctor's office haven't switched to digital charts yet. However, your suggestions are nonetheless good ones and will be taken into consideration. Thank you.  <BR> <BR>Fonts will be an important consideration so that the technician, or the patient or whoever is using the forms fills them out reliably and quickly. Also if the chart is copied or faxed, the type needs to remain legible even if the reproduction isn't pefect. Currently I'm considering Officina, which was designed precisely for this task, but I think I may ultimately go another font because Officina Sans reminds me too much of the 1990s. Any suggestions are, of course, welcome.</div>
