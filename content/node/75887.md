  body: "My, but that is cute. Of course, though, I find it hard to relate. I can
    imagine people falling in love with a Monotype machine, but Linotype is just too
    limited!\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, a Monotype caster is big and bulky and pretty
    indulgent too. And the fumes!\r\n\r\nBut if only the Selectric Composer had been
    just a bit more versatile. The Electronic Composer started in the right direction
    - you could tell it to use a different unit system for a Copperplate Gothic element
    or a Cyrillic element - but with a daisywheel instead of a typeball, and just
    a bit more versatility (the tabs were at 1/6 of an inch intervals, so they could
    have had an extra set of intermediate unit sizes - in addition to 1/72\", 1/84\"
    and 1/96\", they could have had 1/78\" and 1/90\")... they could have had a machine
    just about as flexible as a Monotype caster.\r\n\r\nWhile the Selectric Composer's
    widest characters were 9 units in width, the fit of characters wasn't as crude
    as that might imply. The widest letters, like M, were not as wide as they should
    have been in proportion to others, so most letters were assigned the widths that
    would have been appropriate in a system of 11 units to the em. A daisywheel element
    could have allowed avoiding that compromise. Just as no one is bothered by the
    18-unit quantization of Monotype, I think that the Selectric Composer was good
    enough in this respect.\r\n\r\nSadly, that's a toy that never existed, and thus
    one no one can collect. But our laser printers can do more in any event. (I pine
    for what it could have been on my web site [[http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/propint.htm|here]]."
