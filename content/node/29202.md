body: I used to be able to make the grids print or appear in a PDF using the non-printing
  objects and show grids in print dialogue. For some reason they do not show up now.
  What am I doing wrong?

  body: "James, the headline asks about Indesign, which is only available for OS X
    I believe. Is it CS or CS2? Unfortunately I'm a bit of a newbie in Indesign but
    i have a book right here that shows the General Panel (under Export PDF) - under
    \"Include\" you check \"VIsible Guides and Baseline Grids\"\r\n\r\nIs this what
    you tried that didn't work?"

  body: Patty's advice works for me, but I notice that it is a page-specific feature;
    you can have different grids and guides across a number of pages in ID. So perhaps
    check the page range in the .pdf dialogue? It's my usual mistake...

    before with no problems. CS for the record, OSX.\r\n\r\nI did change the color
    of the grid. I was wondering if anyone else had encountered the issue."

    but no luck. Must be a system quirt or font problem (possibly).\r\n\r\nThe only
    thing I've done differently this time through is to change the color of the grid."
