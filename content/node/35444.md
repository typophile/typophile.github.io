  body: "Nice typeface, the only comment I would have is the \"T\" should NOT be seperated
    by a line, as all other text is clearly joined without any interruption. Other
    then that it is a unique engraved looking style of text. I most definitely could
    see that being used for a Texan Bar or restaurant, or as a branding iron. It is
    reminiscent of the old days.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Joyce.T.~\r\n\r\n"

    for the comment. You are right about the T. Am sure I had experimented with closing
    the right base serif of the T with the E, but didn't do it. The logo was done
    on spec, so it was a rush to get the thing done. What a nightmare to balance feinschmecking
    detail with the overall look! You have a great eye. After twenty years, I wouldn't
    have made that observation. And even now I don't remember the type this hand lettering
    was based on."
