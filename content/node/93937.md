  suggestions would be great. As an aside, should the body serif also be condensed,
  or is it fine to pair a condensed sans headline with a non-condensed body serif.
  \r\n\r\nThankyou"

  body: Sure you can combine them with a normal-width serif, too. News Gothic works
    well with almost all styles of serif typefaces. If you are looking for a rather
    economic text face, Ehrhardt or <a href="http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/?page_id=3047">Equity</a>
    comes to my mind. Or other Transitionals or Scotches, e.g. I like <a href="http://www.theharrietseries.com/">Harriet</a>
    a lot.
