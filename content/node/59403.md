body: "My next big project is assisting with a design overhaul for a city magazine.
  Their current stock of typefaces are difficult to work with and, not to mention,
  to read.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for type for the following elements:\r\n\u2022 Body
  copy: I've been attracted to Hoeffler's Chronicle Text and Sentinel\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Headlines: I would like to narrow down two faces: a serif and sans-serif\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Infobox copy/Captions/Photo Credits: I would like to use a sans serif condensed
  font. Topping my list: Frutiger, Myriad, Gill Sans\r\n\r\nI'd love some feedback.
  If anyone has any resources, books, advice, tips or tricks, please send them my
  way! You can e-mail me at heather@braggmedia.com."
