  body: "This is hand-painted lettering. Similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/ortem/|Ortem]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/seagull/|Seagull]]. This style is usually
    considered Art Nouveau, and if you use that as the search term you will find a
    number of similar styles. I searched at MyFonts, Dafont and Abstract Fonts before
    realizing that this is not a font. You can see that the letters, while very similar,
    are not identical when they should be the same.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Legrand, which is also in the same range."

  body: "I would say it is not hand-painted but stencilled. There is a slight difference
    between \xC9 and E, probably due to stretching of the cutout material. The Ls
    in VILLA look identical. This is a familiar sort of white-on-blue metal plaque
    that was made by an enameling process; many cities have civic street numbers that
    were done the same way in the first half of the 20th c."
