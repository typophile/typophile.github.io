  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm finishing the text of my PhD dissertation in computer science.  As the process wears on, I have the increasingly nagging feeling that I could have picked better faces, so I am interested in getting some advice.  Here are the constraints for my project:

<ul>
<li>I'm using pdfLaTeX and can employ OpenType fonts.</li>
<li>I have licensed the Adobe Font Folio Education Essentials, the Adobe Type Classics for Learning, the faces that come with CS3, and several other (mostly sans) faces including Proxima Nova and Expo Sans.  I am open to licensing other faces if necessary, but am operating under quite a limited budget.</li>
<li>I need a decent serif for text, and am partial to humanist and garalde styles. I also need a decent sans (or something) for things like programming-language keywords and names of relations; a good set of symbols for math; and a typewriter face for source code and command names (most of which are in figures but some of which have to appear inline).  I am open to suggestions for how to handle contrasting text that would obviate a sans, but the symbol and typewriter faces are necessary.</li>
<li>I will be producing two versions of the document, with (hopefully minor) differences:  the first will conform to all of the typewriter-and-whiteout-era restrictions that universities impose on "official" copies of dissertations; the second will be unfettered by these constraints (thus, hopefully more attractive) and designed for screen viewing or low-resolution print.</li>
</ul>

Right now, I'm using Arno Pro, Cronos Pro, and AMS Euler.  I like Arno pretty well but am not really that happy with the Arno/Cronos pairing (the x-height of Cronos is just a little too high), and Euler seems to me to be merely the least bad choice for math.

I have considered just going with Computer Modern, which has delightful nostalgia value for young computer scientists (since nearly all of our textbooks were set in it) but is unattractive.  I have also considered Myriad and Minion, which is a safe but generic pairing, and Warnock and Cronos, which looks good in several books and dissertations that I've enjoyed reading lately.

I've attached a page from an older draft of my dissertation that is notable for containing math, sans and serif text, and monospace.  (It also contains some typos, sorry!)



Thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">If you like Garalde you should try Garamond Premier Pro. And I think Cronos would work well with that too. On the other hand Warnock is still fresh for me and I still enjoy seeing it used in longer text settings.</div>
