  a forum thread that is never ending where rather than talking about a certain topic
  or design, which i do enjoy, but i have something that is more like a club. I hope
  to meet make new friends and each week/month we would communicate on the thread
  creating a target audience and  client( simular to attending class). After completion
  of the task ou would post what u have and we would critique the pieces helping each
  others weaknesses and futher developing you our artistic styles learning a few things
  on the way *** i would like all \"task\" to be Print media.**\r\nsuch as editiorial

    professionals and enthusiasts with very high standards, and your proposition does
    not fit in with what we generally do here.\r\n\r\nYou're at liberty to start your
