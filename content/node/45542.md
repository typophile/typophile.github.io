  body: "Well it's not an error message. For some reason after shuffling my font files
    around, Illustrator doesn't like Avenir Book Oblique. It's fine with every other
    weight in the family, but it tells me that Avenir Book Oblique isn't licensed
    and then it won't create outlines. It literally disappears from the menu, and
    of course it gives me the standard thing about not saving it.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty
    weird.\r\n\r\nUp until just now it was doing it also with Avenir Heavy too....\r\n\r\nBut
    then it let me choose create outlines from the menu.\r\n\r\nKinda driving me nuts
    today!"

    where the font used to be but the cached font has no home to point to.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    OT (thank you), and I moved the job along with outlines for all text. I have not
    been able to completely get it to work right though. Whitman SC Osf was the offender
    for me. '

    Maybe that\u2019s the case here too? If Indy can\u2019t find a proper printer(outline)fontfile
    it will give you an error, I guess.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
