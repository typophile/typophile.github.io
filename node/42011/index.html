  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi folks, I wanted to know what your thoughts are on using Helvetica Rounded for headings, Eurostile Bold for sub headings and Eurostile Standard for body text. Does this sound like a reasonable combination to you? I personally think they are definetly 2 contrasting styles, but any suggestions would be nice!</p>
<p>Thanks Craig</p>
<p>EDIT - erm 1st post, just read forum suggestions - so to add this is for a website, my flash portfolio website. Thanks again for any help.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There is little correlation between the appearance of a type in print and online, especially at text size.</p>
<p>If one is familiar with a face in print, it would be foolish to assume that knowledge is worth anything on screen. You have to see it.
There are also many ways to &ldquo;process&rdquo; a type for screen display.</p>
<p>So &ldquo;use Arial/Georgia&rdquo; is safe, but I&rsquo;d say, try your idea and see if it works for your readership on their preferred browsers/OS.</p>
<p>[update]</p>
<p>OK, there is some correlation!
Looks fine to me.</p>

<p>Finally, while I am a fan of Flash, it is only for its correct use. Now that sample may not represent the entire site, but there is nothing there that cannot be done better in HTML. If there is no reason to use Flash, don&rsquo;t use it. (And I don&rsquo;t consider things moving around mindlessly to be a reason.) Work hard to achieve your goals with HTML and CSS, and then, only if needed, move to Flash.</p>
<p>Reasons not to use Flash include the impossibilty of someone bookmarking a portion of your site, and the probability that your site will be completely ignored by search engines.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;What is it about young designers that makes them want to have black/dark backgrounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On screen, i find it&rsquo;s almost the opposite of print. the darker the screen, the less light your eyes are bombarded with. This is especially true when it&rsquo;s projected (although a rarer occurrence) A lot of times, flash sites are designed with this in mind. I find using black just as legible in this case, maybe not the pattern.</p>
<p>As to the Helvetica rounded, it seems to be okay on-screen in this instance, although its not my favorite typeface, it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be doing anything visually weird. I would definitely get rid of the euorstile</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As for white text on black, at least for me, it is virtually illegible on my malfunctioning monitor. I can&rsquo;t really do anything about it as I am located near a strong radio interference source, and any monitor would be doing the same thing here, and moving is impractical. Oddly enough, orange text on a dark gray background suppresses the appearance of these distortions.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s just my special case. In general, if you <em>must</em> use reversed out text, it&rsquo;s a good idea so step up the weight a notch, i.e.: change your text weight from Regular to Medium and Bold to Heavy (if you&rsquo;re using the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile/|URW++ version of Eurostile]]).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks for your thoughts folks - Eurostile is now gone, replaced with Helvetica Neue and i&rsquo;ve upped the weight.</p>
<p>Regarding the dark background I also prefer dark to white because of the screen glare, but this is a debate which seems to rage on!</p>
<p>The site is just a one page site, with the main emphasis on my work, which constantly scrolls slowly above the text in the sample. I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it nice, simple and intuitive.</p>
