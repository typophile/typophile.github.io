body: Does anyone know what caused the typophile forums to be down for almost two
  days? &#40;reading would partially work&#41; but posting would give out MySQL errors.
  <BR> <BR>just wondering...

  body: Do you think hrant went to the typophile detox center for a withdrawl. I mean
    he couldn&#39;t post at least 50 posts when the forms were down.

  body: Clearly, it&#39;s someone fixing the office pool as to when Hrant hits 8000
    posts. That&#39;s the only logical explanation. ;&#41;
