body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have made a resolution to create a font.  I am a long time
  graphic designer.  I would like information on:\r\n\r\nWhat font creation program
  to use?\r\nWhat file formats (or type of font) to generate?\r\nAny web sites that
  describe the process in detail?\r\nAny books that are a must read for font creation?\r\nWhat
  problems will I expect to encounter,  and how can I avoid these common pitfalls.\r\n\r\n\r\nA
  basic breakdown of the process,  i.e. draw it on paper first, or start with another
  font first and edit it...  \r\n\r\nI also need to know how to document my process
  so I can establish my intellectual property and not have issues with claims of ownership.
  \ \r\n\r\nI really appreciate in advance anyone who takes the time to answer these
  questions and even suggest other questions I should be asking. If answering,  assume
  I know nothing,  to please be detailed.  I would like to do a complete font set. "

    <em>Any web sites that describe the process in detail?</em>\r\nNot really, since
    there are too many details to describe. There are websites that show the basics;
    see Miss Tiffany's post.\r\n\r\n> <em>Any books that are a must read for font
    creation?</em>\r\nNot must reads, but can be useful: [[http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509|Designing
    Type by Karen Cheng]] and [[http://www.amazon.com/Learn-FontLab-Fast-Leslie-Cabarga/dp/0965762858|Learn
    FontLab Fast by Leslie Cabarga]] and I found [[http://www.amazon.com/Stroke-Theory-Writing-Gerrit-Noordzij/dp/0907259308|The
    Stroke by Gerrit Noordzij]] an interesting read.\r\n\r\n> <em>What problems will

    many to even start. :)\r\n\r\n> <em>A basic breakdown of the process, i.e. draw

    you find that works the best. Personally I prefer drawing on paper first, then
    scan these and digitize them; but only as a starting point. I never draw perfect
    glyphs. I would avoid the editing of existing fonts.\r\n\r\n> <em>I also need
    to know how to document my process so I can establish my intellectual property
