body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nHere are some tests for my little company.\r\nWe mainly imports
  products (most of them from italy). We do not sell directly to the final customer.\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see, I'm not especially a master designer (far away from that, I'm web developer)
  but this is going to passionate me more everyday. So I certainly made evident big
  mistakes but I don't know them : every constructive critics are welcome !\r\n\r\nSo
  here is how I though: \r\n- D L V letters can be the same character with 45\xB0
  rotation if you delete the vertical bar from the 'D'. \r\n- The 2.5D box made with
  these letters could represent the boxes we deal everyday with (not really inspired)\r\n-
  The circle in the middle represent the company, which buy goods (vertical simple
  line) to supply its retailers (multiple dispersing lines)\r\n- 1, 3 & 4 could represent
  an UP arrow, synonym of prosperity\r\n\r\nThe typo used is a classic Gill sans MS,
  at this stage I give priority to the logo itself.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    am web developer too!)\r\n\r\nMaybe you are having too many thoughts about what
    the logo should represent. I think it's best to pick one of the ideas/bullet points
    above and then develop it further. At the moment, I like logo #1 the most. The
    other ones may not scale down well, due to the many thin white lines.\r\n\r\nIf
    you say, you are mostly selling Italian products you might also want to consider
    using a colour scheme that feels more Italian, e.g. terracotta or light brown.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign Portfolio]]"

  body: "Thanx tintin for the comment.\r\n\r\nI will consider your colour scheme idea,
    nice ! \r\n\r\nThe main idea was the third bullet, so I maybe should try something
    else with that idea in mind. To be honest, I noticed the \"UP arrow\" thing when
    completed so it can be forgotten.\r\n\r\nI got loslogos yesterday, I may find
    a revelation who knows :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Wow! I think it's awesome work! The only thing I'd change, in the first logo,
    make the inside of the box darker, rather than the left side of it. Maybe put
    one line to define the inner corner. But pretty good mate!

  body: "What's more italian than Ferrari Red? I see nothing wrong with the color
    (especially if it's related to speed/vehicles.) Red cars get pulled over most
    than any other color. Ducatti and Ferrari are both read. OK, enough about color.\r\n\r\nHere's
    what I'd do :\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pic1_4478.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    way I think you get to keep the whole one line/three lines thing. Maybe play around
    with the white lines (thicker), so it works on small sizes and when printed on
    boxes.\r\n\r\nAbout Gill Sans\u2026 not too sure. Maybe try an Italian typeface?
    One more dynamic?\r\n\r\nThat's my two cents.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "I think TypoJunkie is right actually. Red may be a very \"Italian\" colour
    after all! \r\n\r\nIn fact I think your concept is so good that colour becomes
    a secondary issue here. Maybe you should carry on designing your logo in black
    and white and then add colour only at the very last stage. Sorry for confusing
    you in my first post :-)\r\n\r\nMy favourites are versions 1 and 3. Version 2
    looks great too. Versions 4, 6 and 7 don't tell me anything. I can't see the letters
    D, L and V in there.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign]]"

  body: "TypoJunkie, you are not wrong. That red is quite dynamic and that's good
    for the company. The simple line instead of the confusing 3 lines is a good compromise
    too. \r\n\r\nI just understood what you wanted to say by \"inside of the box darker\".
    In fact I don't see the cube as you do : for me it's a 3D cube standing on a peak.
    You seem to see it from the inside, right ?\r\n\r\nBy the way I have been accommodated
    to the last one (brown-yellow). \r\n\r\nSo now I'm facing a dilemma : \r\n<ul>\r\n<ol>background
    or two-colors letters without background</ol>\r\n<ol>splitted \"V\" or not</ol>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<a

    is a quick mock-up, no major changes.\r\nNotice the bridge between to P & O :
    glasses & motorcycle related. Too much ?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dlv-test_3985.gif]"

    advice. Keep it simple. Although the bridge does reference to motorcycles, you
    now have too many ideas floating around. I'd lose the bridge and concentrate on
    the strong mark. You're almost there.\r\n"

    body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nHere is the last update. I had different critics about the
      typo :\r\n\r\n1. eurostile & neuropol extended : \"L\" can be read as a \"I\"
      \r\n2. microgramma : idem, weight too heavy\r\n3. solaris : \"V\" can be read
      as a \"U\", I had to make the font a little bolder\r\n\r\nWhat I think about
      that:\r\n1. .. not sure, all letters are small case. But I'm not sure it's a
      good idea to mix 2 different fonts. Maybe play with letter-spacing, etc.\r\n2.
      For me it's the more motorcycle related font of the three.\r\n3. Not false,
      but there is something that I like in this font. \"L\" is readable.\r\n\r\nI'm
      satisfied with all fonts but I needed to show it to non designer people, to
      hear what they see.\r\nYour designer point of view interest me much. What do
      you think ?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-dlv_5112.gif]"
