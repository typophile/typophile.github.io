  want to bring in a clean, crisp and simple sans to pair with warnock. I was thinking
  in an direction of berthold akzidenz, ff meta or franklin gothic. Am i way off?
  Still don`t feel i have found \"the one\".\r\n\r\nI was wondering what guidelines
  to follow when paring sans and serifs. What should I be aware of, and what to avoid?\r\n\r\n"

    I am not familiar with warnock before I startet with the magazine. Would you recommend
    warnock pro for best legibility?"

  body: "It all boils down to preference, in the end. And it depends on how the text
    is set, how it's printed, etc.\r\nOptical weights are useful for the added flexibility
    they offer in setting the same typeface at noticeable different sizes maintaining
    an harmonious colour.\r\n"
