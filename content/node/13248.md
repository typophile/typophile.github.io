body: I remember my mother using a symbol in handwritten correspondence that looked
  like a lower case c with a horizontal line over it that I understood to mean "with".
  Is this a fanciful reconstruction on my part? Is it part of any standard character
  set? Here's some <a href="http://tfisf.com/extra/with.png">context</a>.

  body: "It's medical shorthand. Actually it could be general shorthand too. But I
    know it's medical shorthand. I found my wife using it in a card to her mother.
    I had to tell her - 'look, your mom isn't going to know what that means'. So no,
    you are not making it all up.\r\n\r\n"

  body: For what it's worth, the medical shorthand refers to the Latin word <em>cum</em>,
    which means <strong>with</strong> (as in <em>Magna cum Laude</em>, with High Honors).

  body: 'We still haven''t answered one of Toothfish''s questions. Anybody ever seen
    this glyph as part of a standard charcter set? For instance, I know there were
    stenographer machines once ( now? ) - did/do they use this symbol? Is it a part
    of Unicode fonts?  '

  body: "I can't speak to its availability as a glyph (although I suppose you could
    make one with a \"c\" and a macron), but I do know that it comes from the Latin
    <em>cum</em>.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you sometimes see in the medical field s-macron,
    meaning \"without,\" from the Latin <em>sin</em>. There's a whole world of interesting
    medical shorthand, including <em>OS</em> (\"left eye\") and <em>NPO</em> (\"nothing
    by mouth\").\r\n\r\nvv\r\nJ.O.\r\n\r\n\r\nNai tiruvantel ar varyuvantel i Valar
