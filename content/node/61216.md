body: "Hi,\r\nI are finalizing our logo which has been created based on the Bauer
  Bodoni Italic font. The closest match to this font which all users have by default
  is Georgia.\r\n\r\nI am a little stuck on a few things for the website and e-book
  PDF (all digital/on-screen and not print):\r\n\r\n1) For the website, if I use Georgia
  for headings, would Verdana be the ideal choice for body content? If not, what other
  combinations would go well?\r\n\r\n2) For the e-book PDF, I have used Georgia for
  headings and Myriad Pro for body content (Verdana did not flow well for the PDF
  compared to how it looks on the web), but I'm still not sure Georgia and Myriad
  Pro are the best for the e-book. Any suggestions please?\r\n\r\n\r\nMy main problem
  is that I want the logo, e-book PDF and website, to all flow consistently with little
  variation in their presentation. This may sound silly, but I don't want to use \"generic\"
  fonts in the e-book PDF (Georgia, Verdana, etc.) as I have always felt that a professional
  e-book would use \"better\" fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your help,\r\n\r\nBec"

  body: "Not sure why you're concerned about the eBook as fonts can easily be embedded
    and will display correct on any machine. The web is a tough one but I use 'Georgia'
    for headlines and 'Arial' for body and it looks good.\r\n\r\nHave you ever tried
    <a href=\"http://www.typetester.org/\">Typetester</a> for comparing online screen
    fonts? Pretty sweet and it will even generate your CSS. :)\r\n\r\nYou might also
    want to check out <a href=\"http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/\">SifR</a>.
    It is an option for getting an expanded set of fonts on your site. Another group
    is also working on <a href=\"http://typekit.com/\">TypeKit</a>.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi CreativeNRG,\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nMy concern with the eBook
    fonts is that I have always thought \"better\" fonts (not default safe list fonts)
    should be used. If you are going to go to the effort of making a professional
    look ebook and not just simply converting a word document to PDF, then I believe
    \"better\" fonts should be used.\r\n\r\nWhat other fonts are good on the eyes
    for a 2-column e-book, 6-8 lines per paragraph and about 25 pages? There are images
    scattered throughout also.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "@ rebeccas:\r\n\r\nAs far as the eBook is concerned use 'Bauer Bodoni Italic'
    in your professional layout. Once complete print to 'Postscript' and use Adobe
    Distiller to create a PDF with the setting of 'Standard'. If you click on the
    'Settings' menu, pick 'Edit Adobe PDF Settings' and click on the 'Fonts' tab you'll
    discover that it is set to embed and create a subset of any font used. Everything
    will display and print perfectly when anyone opens it because their machine will
    pull the embedded fonts from the PDF file. For added security you can 'lock' the
    eBook from being modified, printed, etc."

  body: "Hi CreativeNRG,\r\nThanks again for your help with this.\r\n\r\nI think Bauer
    Bodoni for the eBook headings and Georgia for the website headings will go perfectly.
    Verdana for the website body content will go well with Georgia, but what would
    you suggest for the Verdana alternative for the eBook body content?\r\n\r\nBauer
    Bodoni > Georgia and vice versa, but not sure for Verdana > ???? (something that
    is very similar to Verdana)?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"
