body: "The history of the Latin alphabet and the history of Christianity are inextricably
  intertwined. It is impossible to overstate the importance of Christianity to the
  development of type in Europe, and by extension most of the Western Hemisphere.
  [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s efforts in developing [[movable type]] were in large part
  driven by his efforts to more economically and rapidly print the Catholic Bible.\r\n\r\nThe
  letter forms used in texts written in the Latin script were modeled on scribal handwriting,
  and many modern adaptations to Latinate scripts of spoken languages in the Americas
  were done by Christian missionaries. Christianity was also integral to the preservation
  of [[Greek]] in Europe (as well as the development of [[polytonic Greek]]). Orthodox
  Christian monks also designed the [[Cyrillic]] alphabet as part of their efforts
  to bring Christianity to ancient Rus.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Christianity of many
  of the most well-known type designers did much to shape their conception of scripts
  and type. [[Eric Gill]] is the designer whose Christianity is widely known to have
  affected his approach to letters, but many designers of [[blackletter]] and [[uncial]]
  alphabets (such as [[Rudolf Koch]] and [[Victor Hammer]]) also conceived of typecraft
  as a fundamentally religious activity.\r\n\r\n<cite>[This is a stub entry. Please
