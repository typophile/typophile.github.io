body: "Am currently doing the Channel X ISTD Brief, where we have to come up with
  an identity for the channel (name, logo etc.)\r\n\r\nI came up with the name VIRUS.
  I am however struggling with the logo at the moment. I have lots of ideas of what
  to do with the identity visually, but need to come up with my logo first to do these.
  \r\n\r\nThis is what I have so far -\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_ideas_5629.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  top typeface is Neutraface, with the second being Avant Garde. \r\n\r\nI have converted
  the V in both typefaces to triangles, by copying the 'I' and forming a line at the
  top of the V to create the shape. \r\n\r\nThis triangle is the 'virus', and will
  be used in TV indents and so forth. \r\n\r\nI personally prefer the Neutraface typeface,
  as I like the R within it. But the V is the most important character, and it is
  not very geometrical, as it has slight curves within it. My tutor also pointed out
  that the V seemed quite thin compared to the letters R, U and S, where as it should
  be the most prominent letter within the word.\r\n\r\nWhen I have tried to make the
  currently flat bottom of the V into a point I have found that both typefaces are
  not symmetrical. Do any of you have any ideas?"

  body: "Typically, in typography, horizontal forms are less high than the vertical
    forms are large. Have a look at the horizontal part at the top of the R and try
    to emulate that height. That is one of the issues.\r\nSecondly, if you close a
    V, you typically have to enlarge it at the top to give it the same optical weight
    as the other letters. Check the difference in width between V and A to understand
    that. Also take an A, put it upside down and make the bar slide up towards the
    opening, you'll see that you want to open the A to keep the correct weight.\r\nThirdly,
    the diagonals always darken upon meeting the horizontals. You need to cheat a
    bit. As you cannot create inkgaps, you would need to work on the shape of the
    diagonals so they narrow down slightly when they meet the horizontal. (Think about
    your lines as a sausage: if you cut perpendicular, you have a slice the width
    of the sausage; if you cut diagonally, you have a slice larger than the sausage,
    right? Hence why the joint looks darker.\r\nLastly, to make the V more prominent,
    you can use a V from a larger font size but then you will have to thin it down
    in order to give it the right optical weight!\r\n\r\nIMVHO all of this should
    explain why letters are not purely geometrical! \r\n\r\nPS. Remember TV screens
    are v low resolution and that everything done for TV must be checked on a TV!\r\n"

    this particular channel.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing anything about the channel, I
    wonder if either of these fonts is a good match.\r\n\r\nBut the enclosing of the
    \"V\" seems not a good idea on the surface. If you need a purely typographic/glyphic
    icon, consider alternatives."

  body: "Neutra is always nice, but does it fit?\r\nAnd yes, you need to widen the
    \"V\" if you want to close it. But I'd agree with Eric that it's not necessarily
    a good idea. For one thing, it can easily be read as an arrow pointing downwards.
    And as for \"this is the virus\", how so? When I search for pictures of viruses,
    I get no triangles, but mostly nicely complex shapes that look like balls with
    points protruding from them in all directions \u2013 kinda like 3D stars. Those
    might be interesting to work with/from.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"I have lots of ideas of
    what to do with the identity visually\"</cite>\r\nLike what? Maybe you can work
    towards a logo solution from there."

  body: "\r\n\r\nI don't know if you have made a profile of the channel, like who's
    the audience, what kind of programs they will show, etc? This could be useful
    as I have the feeling that both the choice of the word virus as well as the typeface
    choice seem a bit, um, arbitrary. Try to make a coherent picture of the how and
    why, with words and images you would associate with your ideas, and then come
    back to creating a logo and all the rest. I think this will give you more direction.\r\n\r\nTo
    come back to what you've shown: I agree with the others here: though I like Neutraface,
    I feel like there is no particular connection with the word virus. Not that you
    have to visually translate the word, but I think a virus is more complex and also
    more 'dirty' ;) I would look at typefaces that are more irregular. Or alternatively,
    I would try to establish more contrast between the cleanness of the typeface to
    the logomark.\r\n\r\nI also think that the triangle as logo used seperately is
    not distinguishable enough. It's good to keep a certain simplicity when working
    for the screen, but try finding something a bit more 'dangerous' or 'infecting',
    if you catch my drift. Something more memorable too.\r\n\r\ngreetings Jeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

    paradoxically the tricky way\r\nb. you slide down the V and lengthen the two sides
    (arms) - easier, but you need to shift slightly the optical corrections so your
    arms don't look too bent or too dark! With the 'arrow' of the V further below
    baseline, it will take prominence, too.\r\n\r\nLet us know how you get on."

    an international TV Brand. We love our drama, reality TV, films, soaps and niche
    programmes. We commission gutsy programmes and blend cool drama with our own lifestyles.
    We segue effortlessly from escapist, to gritty, to humanitarian, to sensationalist.\r\n\r\nThe
    picture is fantastic. What\u2019s missing is the frame. We\u2019ve lost our mojo.
    We are too passive \u2013 lost in the avalanche of brands (movies, adverts, sponsors,
    TV shows) screaming for attention. \r\n\r\nWe need to build a big, bold brand
    \u2013 to forge emotional connections with our audiences \u2013 to be open and
    compelling \u2013 rooted in truth and effect. We want to carve out a place in
    people\u2019s hearts \u2013 be a challenger and express a clear point of view.
    We need to be more than expected \u2013 not just any other channel.\r\n\r\nThe
    Brief\r\nWe want you to develop the identity/look and creative direction of the
    channel.\r\n\r\nName\r\nChannel X is only a working title \u2013 we want you to
    come up with a name that reflects the personality and values of the channel.\r\n\r\nLogo\r\nCreate
    a logo that represents the channel. It can be live action, animation-based and
    it needs to have a strong, bold attitude that feels alive while being essentially
    typographic. This needs to be applied for on screen use and for a range of channel
    marketing materials and merchandise.\r\n\r\ndo\r\n\u2013 create a distinct, expressive,
    cohesive, entertaining, exciting channel look.\r\n\u2013 have a strategy that
    is driven by the proposition \u2018stimulation for the masses\u2019.\r\n\u2013
    relate the look to channel content.\r\n\r\ndon\u2019t\r\n\u2013 create typical

    but have sophisticated spending and tastes.\r\n\u2013 are articulate but not necessarily
    university educated.\r\n\u2013 are 16\u201345 with a slight male bias.\r\n\u2013
    are a cultural mix.\r\n\u2013 includes young parents.\r\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI
    feel the channel is trying to be like a mix of Channel 4 and MTV. I had a bit
    of the trouble with the name, but in the end came up with virus. The reasons being
    - I thought it was a bit out there, going to cause some debate (as it is in whole
    a negative word), and I thought there would be a lot of visuals I could play around
    with. \r\n\r\nMy idea of visuals is -\r\n- the virus (a shape) spreading over
    the screen for indents.\r\n- a launch (viral) campaign stating there is a international
    epidemic coming (in a tasteful way)\r\n- campaigns such as - I've got the virus,
    the virus is contagious etc. \r\n\r\nI chose the triangle, as a lot of the virus'
    that I researched had pointy bits to them (to infect). The first thing that jumped
    into my head was the triangle - which I thought was convenient as the V was almost
    a triangle itself. \r\n\r\nI've had real problems with this brief, so any advice,
    help, ideas, pointers would be a really big help :)\r\n\r\nIf you think the name
    is completely wrong, give me some suggestions - however I'm quite far into this
    brief now, so not sure if a name change would be good.\r\n\r\nBut any ideas for
    a logo would be much appreciated :)"

  body: "Well, reading the brief (which was really enlightening) I can understand
    the name a bit better, as it is kind of dangerous and spreading...\r\n\r\nI'm
    just gonna give you my verdict on what you have in combination the brief, I hope
    this will help you:\r\n\r\nI think it's all way to generic and, frankly, boring.
    In the brief they're talking about being 'gutsy', 'escapist' and 'gritty'. I see
    none of that in the stuff you presented. TV is a very competitive market, and
    the channel has to really stand out, this just doesn't. I think the idea you sketched
    is still short of 'meat'. It's just one idea with vague notions of what you want
    to do. I think you have to come up with a far more elaborate 'story'. It needs
    to be coherent and it needs to stick. As I said before I would work on this first,
    look for, or make images that fit with the story, and try to find out why. A logo
    is just a logo, to have an on screen identity a wholly different thing. I would
    advise you to develop the logo as part of the identity, not as a seperate part.
    I also would advise you to drop what you've made until now, as it limits your
    research and explorations. Try to sketch more and be much bolder and crazy before
    you start fiddling with the details, like the point of the V. And try to surprise
    yourself, it has to excite you at least, otherwise no one else is gonna get excited
    over it.\r\n\r\nGood luck and I hope you show us your new stuff here!\r\n\r\ngreetings
