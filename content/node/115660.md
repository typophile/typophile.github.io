  images.\r\n\r\nThe're from film noir films in the 1940s/1950's. \r\n\r\nAre these
  fonts still available? \r\n\r\nOr what would alternatives be?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot
  for any help!\r\n\r\n(Sorry if I've posted in the wrong forum. I wasn't sure where
  this question belongs :)"

    \"kitschy\", unfortunately.\r\n\r\nAre there any film noir typefaces available
    which are authentic and genuinely original, ie. from the 1940's/1950's?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
