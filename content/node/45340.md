body: "Hello All,\r\n\r\nI've tried this on Adobe's InDesign discussion group but
  to no avail. We're in InDesign CS3, in Windows XP.\r\n\r\nWe have a font that InDesign
  CS3 is seeing as a different name on just one of four computers. In other words,
  3 computers see the name as \"My TNTFont\" but that one computer is seeing it as
  \"My TNT Font\" (an extra space btween \"TNT\" and \"Font\").\r\n\r\nThis is a font
  we created (in an older version of Fontographer) and I'm nearly sure the name was
  changed recently, likely since it was used on the troublesome computer (still no
  other computers have the problem). I tried deleting all those silly .lst files that
  Adobe puts all over the place but to no avail. All the computers are pointing at
  the same font files on a network drive.\r\n\r\nDoes any one know of any other places
  where a list of fonts might be kept or some other thing that InD is reading? We
  are using ATM to load fonts and there are other .lst files in the fonts folder but
  I'm leary of deleting those.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch in advance for any help offered,
  \r\n\r\nYours in the font quagmire,\r\nKen"

    Are all computers displaying the same path?\r\n\r\nI suspect the one computer
    showing a different name has the old font installed somewhere.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FindFont_4474.png]"

  body: "Well, I found a work around but, alas, Adobe has defeated/deflated my by
    hiding something, somewhere in which a font name is associated with a font FILEname.\r\n\r\nMiguel:
    The font find dialog shows it as missing, no path was shown.\r\n\r\nI decided
    to rename ANOTHER font and had the same issues. I was UNABLE to get InDesign to
    display the new font names (it was a family). I deleted every adobefnt*.lst file
    I could find as well as the c:\\Windows\\system32\\FNTCACHE.DAT (hoping against
    hope) but to no avail. InDesign was still showing the old font names.\r\n\r\nWondering
    WHAT InD could be looking at, I renamed the font FILE and reloaded the new fonts,
    opened InDesign, used those fonts (which now showed the correct names!!!) and
    closed InDesign. Loading the fonts from a different location did NOT do it, I
    had to rename the font file. After closing InD, unloading the renamed font files
    and reloading the original font files, from the original locations, InD displayed
    the names correctly.\r\n\r\nSo, somewhere, somehow InD associates font names,
    with font FILEnames.\r\n\r\nJust rediculous.\r\n\r\nAll the best and thanks for
    the help.\r\nKen"

  body: Glad you found a solution. I've never heard of such problem. But then again
    you say that this is a custom font generated with an old version of Fontographer.
