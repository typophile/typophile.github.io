  \"Access denied\r\nYou are not authorized to access this page. \"\r\n\r\nI feel
  that it's just a timing issue, with the subject being listed under 'Recent Posts'
  before the post has been completely finished by the author or processed by the system.
  It's trying to access the appropriate node #, and instead of \"page not found\"
  for a non-existent node, it gives the access denied msg\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    posts in the moderation queue for 4 days now, and I'd just like to know the average
    moderation time. Indeed if moderation takes place at all.\r\n\r\n* Identical posts,
    because the feedback for a spam-suspicious post was a non-descript easily misunderstandable
    error page."
