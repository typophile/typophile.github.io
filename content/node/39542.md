  it proportional to its original intent. I makes me feel so dirty and sinful even
  thought I don't believe in God. Well I believe God is made up of ligatures, yeah
  that\u2019s it. I told them that squeezing type is wrong, If you designed a typeface
  would you want to see it squeezed to fit on some huge billboard? I think not. One
  wouldn't skew a painting, One shouldn't skew type. If its too small to size it correctly
  then you should work larger. If fact work as large as you can. Working large is
  fun, really it is. The 'center' tool is the Devil."

    into 20 lines or 40 lines into 20?\r\n\r\nCan you go down a point size or two?
    Is there a condensed version? Can the text be edited? Can you fiddle with the
    H&Js?\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "I feel your pain, Chasography. I don't know where it starts or how it happens,
    but irreverence towards typography is a common problem here, too. I really cannot
    believe it when I open a file and find type condensed as much as 85%...sometimes
    even more. I've made similar statements to yours in front of the group, and they
    nod in agreement, then go on offending. It's as if they are insisting that I don't
    know what I'm talking about just because I talk like I know what I'm talking about.\r\n\r\nI
    have learned to do things correctly without asking permission. I no longer mention
    that I've found condensed type in a file, I just correct it, reduce the point
    size to fit and save over. I'm a vigilante, for cryin' out loud! I'm pretty sure
    my supervisors appreciate my efforts even though they might be totally unaware
    that it is happening.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot get my hands on every file.\r\n\r\nAgreed
    regarding centering, and I'm going to add exaggerated drop shadows to your rant.\r\n\r\nI've
    gotten the impression that most of the people using this site are professionals...art
    directors and junk...pretty sure they all completely understand, only they have
    the good fortune of being in charge!\r\n"

  body: "I don't know if you will even get this since its down on the newest board
    but, sometimes its not that bad, but for me...99% condensed is bad. We only have
    condensed Bodoni, Helvetica condensed and Runic or something condensed.... Work
    computers doesn't have that many good typefaces since they mostly download them
    for free. I'm thinking of putting some of mine on cd\u2019s and uploading or just
    buying some. It kinda sucks buying for a wealthy company out of pocket but then
    again I've got my designer side to me. \r\nSee last night I was engraving three
    glass plaques, they were curved into a crescent which is something that is usually
    sandblasted. If it goes too far right or left then the laser will not engrave
    since It thinks its flat and all the same thickness as the center most point.
    In order to have all the type to a point to where it stays in the engraving zone
    it has to be pretty small. I made it that way. I personally like lots of white
    space but they don't. They want a maximum of a half inch border and centered.
    They said it was too small, that I didn't have to make it ALL smaller, I said
    that if the logo and the 'presented to' and the year was the same size then the
    name and the body copy would be insignificant. They said just squeeze it, I did.
    they said \"not that much\" I said it would have to if it is engraved. It was
    condensed about 50%. ugh\r\n\r\nChase Langdon"
