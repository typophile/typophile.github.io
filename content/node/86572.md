body: "I'm looking for a good font to pair with DIN Condensed Bold, preferrably something
  with a large X-Height that's a slab serif or sans-serif but I'm open to the idea
  of a serif font as well. It'll be used for body copy.\r\n\r\nI've tried Bembo (yuck)
  and Gotham (meh) and just sort of went down the list of system fonts on my mac but
  everything seems just sort of blah. Anyone have any suggestions? I'd really like
  to keep DIN because I love the forms of the letters as a headline typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I think it\u2019s easier to pair DIN with a slab or serif than another sans.
    Bembo is a bit too humanist maybe and Gotham not a good match, no. Try more squarish,
    rational typefaces. Republic, Ibis, Adelle, Marconi or Melior come to my mind.\r\n<a
