  body: "Thanks for that Mark, I also came across your faces Mostra and Goldenbook
    while I was searching for fonts from this period...stunning! I thought it was
    Bernhard Gothic but the 'E' threw me off, didn't realise it had alternates!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nRob"

  body: Not all versions of Bernhard Gothic include the alternates, I think just the
    version Jim Spiece did for FontHaus (and the original metal ATF version).
