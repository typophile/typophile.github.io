  Trade Gothic for headings and having the rest of the text in Mrs. Eaves. It looks
  good to my relatively untrained eye but I've noticed that usually it is suggested
  that Mrs. Eaves be paired with a geometrical sans serif. Is this a blasphemous combination
  or is it ok? Any suggestions and advice welcome!"
