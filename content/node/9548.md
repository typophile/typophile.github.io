body: Has anyone yet had a chance to use the new Freehand MX on MacOS X yet? I am
  finding that Freehand 10 on a 500mhz g3 processor a little slow &#40;despite having
  a garden shedfull of RAM&#41;, sufficiently so to be using FontLab&#39;s own outline
  editing tools instead. Is MX faster?

  body: 'David, <BR>FreeHand 10 is, quite frankly, crap. And this is coming from someone
    who has been using the software for 13-odd years. Back when it was still Aldus
    FreeHand. I have kept up to date with the software, and use it quite a bit. The
    10 version was the furthest step back I have ever seen in a software program.
    <BR> <BR>But, joy and gladness, FreeHand 11 is a dream. It does just what it should
    in ways that are smarter than previous versions of the software. I&#39;ve been
    using it extensively in the psat two days for - what else? - drawing letters,
    so have not had a chace to set type in it, or place any images or anything, but
    one thing I can tell you is this: Exported Generic EPS files import into FontLab
    4.5.2 like a dream come true. <BR> <BR>So. FreeHand 11 = thumb&#39;s up from me.
    <BR> <BR>I will be curious to see everyone else&#39;s feelings. <BR> <BR>Best,
    <BR>c'

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always wanted that for Illustrator but haven&#39;t seen any
    plug in&#39;s that do that. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

    MX?

  body: 'Stuart, <BR>a quick pokeabout in the program does not reveal an extrema function.
    Simplify is there with just one parameter: how much. There are no other choices.
    <BR>Of course, lovely and delicious FontLab 4.5 does have the nodes at extremes
    function, as you would expect from such an application. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>c'

  body: 'David, <BR>speed difference. Forgot to address that issue. YES! Freehand
    11 works in real-time, unlike 10, which had some kind of 7-second delay, like
    radio. <BR> <BR>So, yes. And I&#39;m running it on a 500Mhz G4 - yes, I know,
    it&#39;s prehistoric - with 768MB RAM, OS X 10.2.4. <BR> <BR>Recap: Speed = yes.
    <BR> <BR>As for FontLab&#39;s drawing tools... I like them. Once you get used
    to the way that selected nodes and highlighted nodes act differently, and remember
    that the Control key reveals a million fun commands... <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>c'

    its paces. That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. If I still like it after 30 days I&#39;ll
    kick Macromedia some cash. <BR> <BR>c

  body: 'FreeHand 10 works best under Os9 &#40;paradoxical, isn&#39;t it&#41; and
    as you both pointed out it&#39;s messy under X. <BR> <BR>FreeHand MX seems to
    have been pretty rewritten, it&#39;s less buggy and works at lightspeed &#40;and
    I do mean lightspeed&#41;. <BR>I&#39;m using it under Jaguar &#40;10.2.3&#41;
    with a double-processor new G4 and 512Mb of RAM. <BR> <BR>Save often, because
    it easily quits without notice &#40;maybe a bug fix is on the way&#41;. <BR> <BR>For
    the extrema points problem you&#39;ll need a short trip to Fontographer &#40;you
    may use it under OsX installing the non-FPU version&#41;. <BR>Then re-open the
    face in FontLab. <BR>Perhaps FontLab&#39;s FontAudit function will underline the
    need of extrema points but you&#39;ll have to insert them semi-manually &#40;with
    FontAudit bookmarks, that&#39;s all&#41;. <BR> <BR>As for FreeHand: it&#39;s my
    favorite frogram. I started using version 2.02 in 1989 and I can tell you the
    real solid and good versions &#40;if you need to use an old Mac&#41; are: <BR>
    <BR>1&#41; Aldus FreeHand 3.1 <BR>2&#41; Macromedia FreeHand 5.5 <BR>3&#41; Macromedia
    FreeHand 8 <BR>4&#41; Mcromedia FreeHand MX 11 &#40;bug fixes appreciated&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Worst, crappy versions: <BR>1&#41; Aldus FreeHand 4 &#40;the Worst!!!&#41;
    <BR>2&#41; Macromedia FreeHand 7 &#40;Sucks Big Time!&#41; <BR>3&#41; Macromedia
    FreeHand 10 &#40;mostly under X&#41; <BR>At home I still have FreeHand 5.5 and
    8. <BR> <BR>At work I have all versions upgraded from v3.1 to v10. We&#39;ll soon
    buy MX upgrade as it&#39;s available in Italian. <BR> <BR>BTW many OsX programs
    have printing problems due to the lack of printers&#39; drivers. Not a lack of
    the programs, but just to let you know.'

  body: I bought the upgrade to Freehand MX this week and it seems to be far far far
    better - thanks for everyone&#39;s input <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Interestingly, there is a different upgrade cost
    from 10 to MX than other versions - perhaps as an apology for v10&#39;s problems?

  body: 'Oh Jesus... just got the German version of FHMX. Wow. Just.. wow. I sure
    didn&#39;t think Macromedia still had that in &#39;em. The Extrusion Tool is different
    than, say, Dimension, and in these times of Maya and Cinema4D and 3DsMax a bit
    retro, but great fun nevertheless and I still LOVE these weird clunky vector-3D-objects.

  body: '&#62; [Hi, HD. Actually FreeHand MX and 10 are produced without too much
    worry about printed production, since Macromedia is worried mostly by the use
    of FreeHand for web graphics. So, beside the lack of Opentype support, the application
    is quite solid but still have got quite big problems in dealing with complex documents
    for print, using various typefaces, and different encodings. This is a thing they
    probably have no interest in, but along with the lack of driver upgrades for many
    printers, undermines the use you could have made of Freehand under OsX. And I&#39;m
    really sorry about that. I was designing simple logos in MX a few days ago and
    the program quitted unexpectedly some 20-30 times during the morning. Macromedia
    never provided a bug fix for version 10.0 and this speaks a lot about their policy.
    Sad.]'
