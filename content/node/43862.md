  body: "_What is the band like?_\r\n\r\nIt's an a capella band that does a little
    bit of everything, from jazz to barbershop to gospel. They've been around for
    18 years and have performed for U.S. Presidents, etc., and even sang the national
    anthem for one of the Final Four games last year.\r\n\r\nI've already started
    setting type for the project, using Helvetica Neue Ultra Light for the headlines
    and Helvetica Light for the body, but I'm still open to suggestions. My boss hasn't
    seen it yet. ;-)"
