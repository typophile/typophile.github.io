    target="_blank">Goudy Heavyface Condensed</a>, with swashes added. I&#39;ll check
    and see if it&#39;s in any of my old specimen books.

  body: Thanks! I&#39;ve been looking through everything I can think of and the closest
    I&#39;ve come is the Berthold or Goudy family.. didn&#39;t know if there was something
    even closer.. but I think you may be right.

  body: Hmm. You second sample appears to be a different typeface with a similar feel.
    It looks very familiar, but maybe I just remember it from the old Buick ads. Could
    be a custom display font. That was done sometimes, especially with large companies.

  body: Yeah, you&#39;re probably right.  <BR>I&#39;m just going to mock it up for
    some titleing so I&#39;ll just use Goudy Heavyface for a base. <BR>Thanks.
