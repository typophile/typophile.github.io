  target="_blank"> this ID request</a> from 2 weeks ago?  <BR>  <BR>It&#39;s Gaffe
  by Rodney Shelden Fehsenfeld, a typeface   <BR>designed in 1993 that was originally
  published   <BR>through <a href="http://www.garagefonts.com/" target="_blank"> Garage
  Fonts</a>, but that&#39;s nowhere to be   <BR>found on their website these days.

  body: Rodney pulled all his fonts from GF and all other foundries... no distribution,
    but he might sell some of his fonts on a case-by-case basis. If anyone needs to
    contact him, email me privately and I will put you in touch with him. <BR> <BR>

  body: Yeah, so? There is another type family called Gaffe.  <BR>I came across it
    when looking for the Fehsenfeld&#39;s  <BR>Gaffe online, but it doesn&#39;t look
    one bit like  <BR>Rodney&#39;s.
