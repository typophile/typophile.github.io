  Chicken by Pentagram.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.pentagram.com/work/#/all/all/newest/2660/|Lucy's
  Fried Chicken]].\r\n\r\nClearly may well be a custom job, or at least a customised
  version of an existing typeface, but I have been looking for something similar as
  a starting point to my own hand-lettered logo job. For inspiration purposes really!\r\n\r\nThank
  you."
