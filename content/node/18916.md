body: "A pretty standard yet unusual sansserif font was used on Spielberg's movie
  about the aftermath of the 1972 Olympic games.\r\nAnyone knows what it is? I am
  looking for the font actually used in the film's title's, not on the poster.\r\n-
  I have tried attaching a small gif or jpg many times but it doesn't work. Anyone
  interested, please have a look at the trailers here, the font is shown at the end:

    to have flat terminals, maybe it's just the pixel fairies.

  body: "Sorry guys,\r\nI'm sorry about not being able to upload the file; I have
    tried a great many number of times, it just wouldn't work this time for some reason.
    This morning, however, it works fine.\r\nAnyway- in response to all above:\r\nThe
    first sample of M\xDCNCHEN as posted above is not original, it looks different
    in the original english version of MUNICH. So if that posted sample is the abominable
    Arial, it certainly is not what MUNICH used, and NOT what I am looking for.\r\nIt
    certainly is not Akzidenz Grotesk, but you might be right with Chalet - and I
    am surprised, as the lower cases of this font are very ugly. Uppercase seems to
    work really well:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/munich.gif]"
