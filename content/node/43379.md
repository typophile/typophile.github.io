  : [[Writing Systems]] : [[Hebrew]] : Meteg</strong>\r\n\r\nThe meteg (ga'ya) is
  one of the most common accents in the Hebrew Bible, and it  serves two functions:
  phonetical & musical.\r\nIt indicates a secondary accent. We said 'accent',  but
  it is not really  an accent. \r\n\r\nThe meteg is  marked by  a short vertical stroke
  under the word, and generally before the stress syllable. It  resembles  the siluk,
  but has different functions (both are uni05BD).\r\n \r\nGrammatically(1)  there
  are ten different kinds of metegs.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1). If the phonetical & musical  functions
  \  are under one umbrella. "
