  body: The service mark symbol is generally not included in a standard Latin-1 character
    set - Mac or Windows. Some foundries will include this character in a slot reserved
    for some other seldom used character - but not all of them. Depending on the typeface
    you are using, you can approximate the look of an &#39;SM&#39; using superscript
    caps. <BR> <BR>However, the Lucida Grande and Apple Symbols fonts included with
    OS X contain the service mark character. It can be viewed and inserted using the
    Character Palette function.
