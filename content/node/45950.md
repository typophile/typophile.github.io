body: "We need a serious text face for a German translation of <em>Vedanta: A Simple
  Introduction</em>. Not Palatino. Should probably be by a German (or German-speaking)
  designer though. Classic is safe. The book introduces the reader to the Vedanta
  philosophy in clear, straightforward language. It is not heavy reading. Your suggestions
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nAny tips on composing a German text for someone who has experience
  only with English would also be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nD."

    \u2013 but designed by [[Jan Tschichold]]. Plus the typeface is very common in

    tips on composing a German text</cite>\r\n\r\nDo you have something special in
    mind? Some random thoughts: German language can have quite a lot of <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/21117\">long
    compound words</a>. That may affect your decisions on line length and H&J. The
    fact that all nouns start with capital letters \u2013 plus some umlauts here and
    there \u2013 will give you a slightly different colour on the page.\r\n\r\nHave
    a look at the treatment of quotes: <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Anf\xFChrungszeichen\">
    Anf\xFChrungszeichen explained at typografie.info</a>. The standard is \u201Equotes\u201C.
    You can also use \xBBquotes\xAB, which might be nicer, depending on the typeface.
    \xABQuotes\xBB are allowed, too, but those are rather rare.\r\n\r\nThere are certainly
    a lot more details to consider. I don\u2019t know how deep you wanna dive into
    it. There\u2019s a book that covers all of the German typographic rules, and even
    more: <a href=\"http://www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Detailtypografie_(Buch)\">Detailtypographie</a>
    by [[Friedrich Forssman]] and [[Ralf de Jong]]. Purchasing this \u2018bible\u2019
    might be overkill, though.\r\n\r\nF\r\n\r\n\r\n"
