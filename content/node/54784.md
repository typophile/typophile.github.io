  have done some before, but this may be my last one before a real job.  I'm torn
  between choosing places that I would have fun at and like the idea of it but fear
  it might be just easy and not push me as much to think differently, verse serious
  places who I respect and are super sophisticated.\r\n\r\nDo you think its better
  to intern at a place where you think you'd like to work in 10 years or intern someplace
  fun and good, but less serious?"

  body: I'm interning in school, too. I'd say there are pros and cons to both - if
    you intern at a place you want to work for 10 years, you have a greater chance
    of being able to get a job there when you graduate. On the other hand, this might
    be your last chance to try out that crazy place with the expectation that you
    aren't staying long. Although I have a question - why is "not serious" unacceptable
    if it is "good" at the same time? What do they do there? Why do you think it will
    be so easy?

  body: I would go for fun. But I don't think that has to exclude quality?

  body: Fun in my case is quality, just thinking in terms of if I'm still doing that
    when I'm 30, thats a waste.
