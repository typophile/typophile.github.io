  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey guys, I'm currently working up some mock-ups for a "higher end" kitchen store. They currently have a logo but are seeking to become more modernized as the area around them picked up and is starting to get "hip". I've tried all kinds of things and cant really come up with anything I like. I do think the words themselves are more important than any mark. The name just doesn't feel like it requires a mark. Please take a look and give me some feedback!

Sure it can work as a logotype. But why Helvetica? Why not something with more character?

perhaps even custom type?

get a sketch happening.

In the icon version your stove looks like a mobile phone.

type-wise it really depends on what you're going.
underware have "bello" and "sauna" which i think are very friendly/playful.

if thats not what you're after, then finding a good substitute for helvetica shouldn't be too hard. there's so much great type happening all over the world at the moment, your biggest challenge would be trying to chose the one you like the best.

also custom type as suggested by Ratbaggy is a great idea but thats if you know what you're doing and what you want to achieve.

And yes, Ratbaggy's absolutely right, the best way to start is by sketching your ideas on paper without the computer. It hurts me to see a lot of designers avoiding that stage and going directly to the machine.

Best of luck,

Victor

some strong feedback... well maybe that's a good thing ;)

The name is so straight forward that I reckon that this could work very well without a mark.
I do like your Helvetica sketch, but agree that you should find a nice/fresher alternative -
maybe have a look at this [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica/|list that Stephen compiled]].

As for the treatment: I think American Apparel already took your intellectual space with this one.

Also, I remember the old packaging design from the Pathmark supermarkets from growing up in New Jersey. The store brand items were in white boxes, and the name of the product was in black Helvetica. At the bottom of the box were the trademark red and blue stripes of the Pathmark brand, and then in black Helvetica the phrase "no frills."

Unfortunately, there's nothing very epicurean about that.

People who like to cook are passionate about sensory experience. I should know; I like to cook. Helvetica doesn't exactly communicate gustatory passion.

That said, the oven is cute. Overall, I'm not feeling this direction, though.

As for the treatment - be careful of immediate

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_crateandbarrel_4010.gif]

comparisons. That was the first thing I thought of.

And the stove reference is vague.

That said the neutralness of a typeface such as Helvetica may convey the modern feel you want - then it would all come down to the application. I would research the alternates first though.</div>
