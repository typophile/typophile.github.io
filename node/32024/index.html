<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I have been excited to see the release of Softmachine ever since Nick was kind enough to show it to me a year or so ago. I really like the face's personality which is much warmer than VAG rounded or Gotham. Plus It has a <cite>ton</cite> of great features including a really great use of one I have advocated for here on Typophile - Contextual Alternatives - made not to connect letters in a way that better simulates writting ( Nick has done that too in Handsome Pro ) but instead to do something even more essential, to get a better fit - or dare I say it? ...A more ideal 'Notan'*! This may be the ultimate logo font for Web 2.0!

The face itself is adapted from an all-cap design with uniform fit, Monkey, that I did for FontHaus in the mid-90s, with the application of the outlining idea that I started to experiment with in Alphaville Outline. I don't recall being directly influenced by that "Five" album cover in the design of the face, but it certainly pointed me to an appropriate name.

"5" is the rare one—pretty jazzy. Yeh, I didn't want to notify Bill, but a cup of tea with Robert would be a dream come true. His solo work I much prefer to the softies or Matching Mole ; ) Anyway, nice work Mr. Nick Shinn.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, the old "tight but not touching" typositor setting, but touching (!)
Here's a classic example of a tight-setting type design, and the way it relates to layout; from 1969, art director Woody Woodward.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ventures_fivef_6370.jpg]
Faces like this and Advert are spaced tightly, and may be designed for tight setting, but aren't designed specifically for outlining -- note how the angle of A and W are different, and the splayed legs of Advert's M.
Round edges definitely help.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I don't think tight/touching per se is what's interesting here. Advert isn't meant for algorithmic outlining, but apparently it is meant to be layered, which is closely related, as can be seen in that illustration; and most significantly here, it's <cite>spaced</cite> to that end. One might even think that if they had OT back then it would have had contextual spacing as well. We <cite>are</cite> talking about Letterror - well, half of it, but that's still plenty. :-)

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Your point on the affinity of layering and outlining is well made.
Advert wasn't initially designed for layering, the Rough is a "product extension". It takes the basic letterforms, grunges them, and revises the metrics. But the process doesn't go the next step and revise the letter forms, which could have been done without OT. In fact, the combination r_t in the word "Advert" is a prime candidate for changing to look more consistgently "outlined" in layering.
I had thought about a family for Softmachine, but decided that it's OK to be single, like Impact.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> the process doesn’t go the next step and revise the letter forms
Isn't that something any good type designer always does, even for basic designs? I would expect JvR to have done that (which of course is not to say it's not possible to disagree with his particular decisions). The interesting thing about Softmachine is that it makes this basic design principle contextual (which does require OT). This is something Eben has been talking about, although it's always nicer to see it actually hit the ground.
> it’s OK to be single
Fonts without italics, I actually admire - but a gradation of weights is quite useful in my mind - although to some extent Softmachine has that "built-in" (even though I worry about the effects of "blind" tracking to compensate for any weight gain via outlining). BTW, a really nice font with weights only is Stone's Silica:
