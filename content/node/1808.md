body: Does anyone here get How Magazine, and can you name the font they use for their
  heads &#40;at least for the December issue&#41;? It&#39;s a nice sans serif font
  that I&#39;d like to use for my Flash project. In the meantime, I&#39;ll figure
  out how to scan the type &#40;I can scan&#41; and attach it to a post &#40;I&#39;ll
  figure it out--shouldn&#39;t be too difficult, if I need to&#41;. <BR> <BR>Theresa
