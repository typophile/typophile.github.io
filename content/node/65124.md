  but I am not really happy with it at small sizes as a body copy typeface.\r\n\r\nIf
  nothing comes to mind right away, another alternative I would be interested in pursuing
  is a typeface from FontFont that is a good match for my wordmark as well as works
  in both large and small sizes.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n- corey"
