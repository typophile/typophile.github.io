  does not mean you can use it anyway you desire. People and companies have bought
  font license assuming they own it and can use it for websites. Their license did
  not include web usage and they have run into legal issues or can potentially run
  into legal issues in the future. \r\n\r\n(As far as I know) The standard fonts that
  come with Mac and Windows computer come with a license for printed material. Purchasing
  fonts as well comes with a license for printer material. Does that include silk
  screening on clothes or does that require purchasing a separate license? \r\n\r\nThank
  you"

    forum rather than the seldom viewed education forum.

    specific uses.

    printing method: if a foundry's EULA prohibits use in silkscreening, buy your
    fonts from someone else."

    any object, without additional fees. A few such as House Industries have some
    additional clauses that you need to watch out for, however!"
