  body: bespoke   <BR>A adjective  <BR> 1  bespoke, bespoken, made-to-order, tailored,
    tailor-made <BR>    of clothing   <BR> <BR>So yes, most of the American type foundry&#39;s
    and independent designers would fall under this definition - who&#39;s going to
    turn down custom work? <BR> <BR>Or did you have a different meaning in mind? <BR>
    <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: Si I wanted a yank to answer it. So since it sat on the server through a monday

  body: Sorry about that -  now you mention it I don&#39;t recall anyone using &#39;bespoke&#39;
    over here, although it&#39;s horribly common back in the old country. <BR> <BR>Cheers,

  body: In England bespoke is used for taylors and designers... in speach or on the
    windows of the Laundry Taylors. Very common. Bespoke shoes, bespoke taylors, bespoke
    type, bespoke furniture.  <BR> <BR>What a kerfuffle!
