  body: I just opened a keylayout file that I created some years ago with Ukelele.
    It prompted me to add some missing keys  and I said yes and opened it. Looked
    fine. I saved the new file and re-opened it with Ukelele 2.1.4. Looked fine as
    far as I can tell. What was the mess you encountered?

  body: "Well, I opened a system keyboard and began to customize it. Then I closed
    it, changed something with the font to be used and wanted to re-open the ukelele-file.
    \u201CError message\u201D, not to open.\r\nThere are some PUA codes in it. Could
    this be the problem? I hardly believe."

  body: I'm not sure but I think it's because you modified an existing system keyboard.
    Did you give it a new name and new identifier number? That's what I usually do.
    If I'm not mistaken, that was a MUST in Ukelele guide. I have used PUA in the
    past without any problem.

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions! However, while it seemed to have worked this
    afternoon (yes: new name, new number, saved as \u2026) this evening it fails again
    to re-open. Three hours work \u2013 trashed? \r\nInstead of opening the file (not
    even with manually adding \"\u2026keylayout\" to the file name) I get this kind
    information:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ulele_6060.jpg]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    I lack humor for that sort of notification \u2026\r\nWhat the devil is going on?\r\n\r\nOr,
    to ask otherwise: is there an alternative to Ukelele?!"

    marked line must be n\xBA 549. The little square is a musical character. Code:
    F831 (PUA) or 1D147 (SMP 1).\r\n\r\nI tried this: I changed the little black squares
    into an ordinary ASCII char. and saved the file. Whooops \u2013 Ukelele does open
    it! But I wonder: there are many other F8xx or 1Dxxx characters which now seem
    to cause no problem. At the moment (no further alterations made) the file closed
    re-opens normally. \r\n\r\nStill don\u2019t quite understand that syntax of the
    xml file completely."
