body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m look for a single letter to match a logo. I\u2019m a
  designer but have never understood the nuances of typography. I\u2019ve also a bit
  of a passion for cars. My perennial project car is a 99 Porsche Boxster.\r\n\r\nI
  would like to personalize my Porsche Boxster \u201CS\u201D to a Boxster \u201CK\u201D.
  \ All Porsches of late (Including mine) have the same distinctive type face for
  there product name/logo. The type face is incomplete alphabetically. Of all the
  model names currently available, none have a  letter \u201CK\u201D.\r\n\r\nAll I\u2019m
  looking for is the letter \u201CK\u201D in the same vein as the Porches script logos.
  I can provide 5 or 6 of these logos for reference.  I\u2019ve really little to pay
  for this indulgence, but I do 3d graphics\u2019 and 3d modeling and more (krokodesign.com)
  and could trade time for time\u2026dunno\u2026\r\n\r\nBelow is the type face as
  used for my car.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you can help, Thanks \r\n\r\nPK\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/porsche-boxster_emblem_5044.jpg]"

  body: "Not sure how to be more clear\u2026Um\u2026I would like to replace that \u201CS\u201D
    above with a \u201CK\u201D designed to share traits of the  typeface used to spell
    \u201CBoxster  S\u201D. In other word, a \u201CK\u201D which appears to come from
    the same font family. \r\n\r\n A complete font family is not available and probably
    doesn\u2019t exist\r\n\r\nRegards, PK\r\n"
