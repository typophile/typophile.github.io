    namesake sans.\r\n\r\nBut how about one of the more modern takes on the the British
    sans, like Agenda (Font Bureau), Today Sans (Scangraphic), Bliss (Jeremy Tankard),
    or Foundry Sterling? Or the sans that inspired Eric Gill in the first place: Johnston's
    Underground signage face?\r\n\r\nhttp://fontbureau.com/fonts/Agenda\r\n\r\nhttp://typography.net/type/bliss.htm\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/today-sans/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/products/london.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=415078&grab_id=0&page_id=35530&query=itc%20johnston&SCOPE=Fonts\r\n\r\nhttp://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/"
