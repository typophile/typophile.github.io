  body: What do you mean by install? <BR> <BR>You can &#39;store&#39; the fonts on
    a server. <BR>But in order for a font to be recognized, it must be installed on
    the workstation.

  body: Sure you can install fonts on a server and also use them from there. At work
    we do it all the time and don&#39;t want duplicates flying around. &#40;w2k server
    and various work stations&#41; <BR> <BR>All you must put in the back of your mind
    is that you map the drive to for example &#39;F:&#39; and links come from there.
    So if you need to map the drive again, choose &#39;F:&#39; again, else there is
    no link to the font files and you must re-install them.

  body: 'Rolf:  <BR> <BR>Thats not &#34;installing&#34; on the server, like I said,
    that is &#34;storing&#34;, then referencing your workstation to that mapped drive.
    <BR> <BR>It has to be then installed on the workstation in order to function.
    Wether you install from a local drive, or a mapped network drive, does not really
    matter.'
