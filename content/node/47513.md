  back in 2002. It's had about 20,000 downloads since then. Recently, a person emailed
  me about using it for a product of 600 units. I have no idea how to price such things
  or go about allowing as such for this kind of permission. I have used the Search
  function on this site to help find an answer but didnt have any luck. Can anyone
  point me in the right direction, or provide an answer to such a request? thanks!"

  body: "wesmo,\r\n\r\nI think you should browse for existing fonts, compare their
    prices, etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, your font is unique, and if someone wants to use it
    in a product, it's probably well worth it, then they should pay a reasonable price
    for it.\r\n\r\nWhat's a reasonable price?  I would say anything between $10 and
    $30 is reasonable for a unique font.\r\n\r\nI hope my comment helps  =)\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nAriel\r\n\r\n---\r\n<a

  body: "are you looking for a single price for unlimited use, Or a price per unit
    (meaning customer's units).\r\nI know you said there will be 600 units, but is
    that the max they are going to be allowed to sell, or an estimate? You'd need
    to set that out in the agreement. "

    are you saying 10-$30 total to just buy the font and use it?\r\n\r\nJasonc:\r\nyou
    bring up a good point about aligning an agreement of total usages. As far as pricing
    per unit or unlimited, what would you advise?\r\nthanks"

    therein lies the problem asking about pricing on the internet. You're not going
    to get any specific numbers that will really apply to your locale and the context
    of the particular business arrangement.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "How are they going to use it on the \"products\"? If it is going to add a
    lot of value to that product then you should charge a reasonable licensing fee.
    You could calculate that as a price per unit, or a price for use on up to a certain
    amount of units. Or, you could charge them a yearly fee to license the font software.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    by initially releasing the work as freeware, you have put yourself in a difficult
    position to now attach any real value to the work."

    details, but I'm just looking for loose direction and I can try to wing it from
    there, especially since it was freeware to begin with."

  body: "\"what would be a reasonable licensing fee if it were a more front-facing
    use?\"\r\n\r\nWe can not give you a specific number that will mean anything. I
    could say $10 and it would be as valid as suggesting $10000.\r\n\r\nWhat, specifically,
    are the products they are going to use the font on? How are they using the font
    on them? Is it 600 units total for ever more? How much are they selling each unit
    for? How big is the company that wants to use it? Who are they selling to? What
    does your current font license state in terms of using it for products? Have they
    made an offer? Do they want exclusivity? These are all questions (and there are
    more) that would need to be addressed before any real numbers could be given that
    would be of any use.\r\n"

    price fixing, those sorts of things. Aluminum's list of questions are right on
    target. Without that information you have nothing to go on.

    SII, no jokes. On the other paw, wesmo, you are asking pretty ugly basic IP questions
    about a font that's been free-wared to the tune of 20,000-1,000,000 free copies.
    Why not familiarize yourself, yourself with font pricing. Everybody who takes
    the time to value and license their IP does this as part of the cost of doing
    business and a real answer to your question would come from a depth of understanding,
    not the superficial places it's coming from here. Go price some other font as
    your client has asked for, See what that price is. Price another. Price until
    you have a Grip, then face the Client with numbers. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    absorbed that. Don't get too testy about jokes; they aren't going to stop. Notice
    that not all of the jokes are at your expense. We like to have fun. \r\n\r\nIf
    you place no value on the font, you might just reply with \"Oh gosh it's freeware,
    thanks for thinking of me but just go ahead and use it\". Or, if you want it to
    take on a new life as a retail product, revise it with more glyphs and better
    kerning, or other weights, or other added value, and launch that as a pay product
    with an explicit license. And the license/pricing for that is also completely
    up to you. Even after asking all the questions mentioned above, there are decisions
    only you can make. "

  body: I've actually been in this situation. I've released a few fonts as freeware
    several years ago, and every once in a while I'll get an inquiry of one sort or
    another regarding this sort of use. I didn't include a detailed EULA, but rather
    a simple read me file suggesting that they were free for commercial and personal
    use. I did include a recommendation, but not a requirement, that if the fonts
    are used in a commercial project that I should be sent a copy of the finished
    product, which I have received from time to time. Not much, mind you. I got a
    Hungarian video game, a badge made by a Finnish language teacher in Russia, a
    French Jazz CD, and a ghastly church newsletter. Only once did I get a payment,
    which I think was insisted upon by the legal department on their end, for a token
    sum of $80 for embedding in another video game which I've never heard about since.
    At least I got the check. If I'd really been thinking about it at the time I could
    have easily charged them more, but yeah, I had already declared it a free product,
    so they weren't obligated to offer me anything, at least that's how I felt at
    the time.
