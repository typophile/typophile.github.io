  body: The white space might get a little too fiddly in the center. The join of the
    /r/ looks too thin. Try to get some more weight on the E's serifs on the right.

  body: "The idea of the lowercase <strong>r</strong> replacing the middle bar of
    the <strong>E</strong> works, but a few details don't look right to me. \r\n\r\nFirst,
    the top of the <strong>r</strong> sits a little below where the middle stroke
    of the <strong>E</strong> would normally be. I'd move it up very slightly.\r\n\r\nSecond,
    the slight concavity of the terminal at the top of the <strong>r</strong> is dissonant
    (to my eye) with the flat outer edges of the serifs on the right-hand side of
    the <strong>E</strong>. I'd make the terminal at the top of the <strong>r</strong>
    (and its flipped image) just a bit less concave.\r\n\r\nFinally, the flipped image
    isn't just a flipped image. The rotated terminal above the <strong>r</strong>
    is visibly wider than the one on the <strong>r</strong> itself. I would make them
    match."

  body: "I might go a little bit more extreme with the serifs. And the beak of the
    \"r\" might be nice as a Gill/Kindersley style* (which would further better replace
    the missing bar/serifs of the \"E\"). Also, I might actually try dumping the stem
    above the \"r\".\r\n\r\n* http://media.mutualart.com/Images/2009_07/08/0013/223991/703c4059-b121-4381-83d1-f2e0dbc8cdf1_g_273.Jpeg\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
