  body: "Thanks Fivos & Kevin for the good suggestions.\r\nI was going through them
    from the top, and the thought occurred to me that Coffee Service might be loosely
    based on Tim Hortons, which is in the business of serving coffee -- mostly to
    the blue collar/sports fan crowd rather than the yuppies of Starbucks.\r\nNow,
    on to the next suggestion...\r\nDon"

  body: "Suzee, Coco and Signalist are interesting as being close on _m_ and _n_ but
    more angular than the other lower case letters in Tim Hortons. All of the suggestions
    are useful for their insights as to how a Tim Hortons font could be constructed.
    An interesting possible alternative to the endless assortment of bulgy irregular
    doodlings and creamy packaging letters  that pass for modern thick scripts.\r\nDon"
