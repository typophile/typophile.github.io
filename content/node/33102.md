  will take place in Prague in the fall. It is called London In Prague (alternatives
  to traditional marketing research). How some of the new marketing techniques that
  are already being used in London (or UK) could be implemented to the Prague (or
  Czech) environment. My initial point was \"take something British and make it Czech\".
  My main question is\u2014is the symbol recognizable enough as a British flag turned
  into a Czech flag? For the typeface I chose Sebastian Text by Frantisek Storm. It
  is slightly reminiscent of Johnston Sans or Gill, but still uniqly Czech (or at
  least I hope). Thanks for your comments."

  body: "I think the typeface choice is great.\r\n\r\nAs for the flag, I got it, but
    it took me a little while. To me, the Union Jack is not just areas of blue and
    red and white, but how they interact. Maybe rather than separating the sections
    completely, take slices out of the British flag that are <strong>mostly</strong>
    one colour, but with a little bit of the others too.\r\n\r\nNot sure if my idea
    would work or look good. As it stands, it's very nice.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "With the red sections positioned like that it resembles a stars and stripes,
    partly because the white portion is hinted at, rather than defined, I am not sure
    that I have a solution, you could try taking the union flag and recolouring the
    sections to resemble the Czech, possibly making a stroke on the white areas. That
    said I like the haphazard image you have created, it is worth pursuing, the type
    choice has the qualities you mention from a British perspective I don\u2019t know
    that I get a Czech flavour (not that I can define that).\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Tim,\r\nthank you so much for your comments. Placing the type above the logo
    would work (it might actually be bilingual, so I could put the english version
    there), but it should also work without the type, se we'd loose the edge again....
    Another problem with this logo was scaling it (making it smaller) the type might
    be hard to read. I'll try to do something with the type. Thanks"

  body: Wow! If I got it, anyone would. haha :D I recognised that the British flag
    was used but as I have no knowledge of Prague, I obviously have no clue on their
    flag but well done! I'm liking it and the typeface is really clean.

  body: I changed the type, it defined the edge and will work better when scaling
    down. The Czech flag is now even more obvious, and I have to trust you ,missgiggles,
    that anyone will (eventualy?) see the British flag :-) [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_3600.gif]

  body: "The basic idea is really good I think.\r\n\r\n> I obviously have no clue
    on their flag\r\n\r\nThat's probably why you saw the British flag so easily...
    This being something to be shown to people who are definitely familiar with the
    Czech flag, I think it is indeed a problem. I think a good way to make it sufficiently
    more British is to work on making the <cite>white</cite> play a much more obvious
    role, instead of making it effectively merely the background of the blue and red
    shards.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I think this is a good solution. Both flags are pretty even. I lost the "messyness"
    of the first image, but it is the interaction of all the elements that create
    the flag, as Lex rightly pointed out, so I guess it had to go. What do you guys
    think? Thanks again for all your help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/London_In_Prague_3_3948.gif]
