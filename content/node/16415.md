body: "I get asked this once in a while and thought I would share. I'd like to know
  what the other experts here use, too.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite resources is \"American
  Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century\" by Mac McGrew. It's very comprehensive
  and easy to use. Another one is the \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" by Jaspert,
  Berry and Johnson. It's not as comprehensive or information packed, but it does
  give release dates and (more importantly) includes most European foundries. These
  are the two best resources I know of for identifying and getting information about
  metal typefaces.\r\n\r\nFor typefaces before the nineteenth century, John Berkely
  Updikes \"Printing Types: Their History and Use\" is useful. There seems to be a
  lack of good reference materials for type in the nineteenth century, except perhaps
  in printing museums and such. Rob Roy Kelly's \"American Wood Type: 1828-1900\"
  is good, but only covers (obviously) wood types.\r\n\r\nFor more recent typefaces
  (post-metal), FontShop's \"FontBook\" is good. It lists all the fonts they carry
  (thousands and thousands) and includes release dates (original and digital, in the
  case of revivals). Unfortunately, this is out of print right now. They are working
  on a new edition which should be out in the near future.\r\n\r\nAnother one I like
  is \"The Solotype Catalog\" by Dan X. Solo. This is especially good for identifying
  phototypesetting and film fonts from the sixties through the eighties.\r\n\r\nFinally,
  there are some online resources that may be of some help, especially for more recent
  fonts:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com\r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com\r\n\r\nI
  particularly like using the preview string features of MyFonts and FontShop. FontShop's
  facility has the added advantage of allowing you to copy the URL and paste it here
  to share the preview with others. (MyFonts used to have this, but they seem to have
  dropped it when they introduced the \"live preview\" feature.) It's very useful
  to enter your preview text before you start searching so that you can see it set
  in all the fonts that come up when you do keyword searches and such.\r\n\r\nAnd
  I mustn't forget Mike Yanega's amazing Script Font Identification Guide:\r\n\r\nhttp://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  those are a few of my most-used resources. Perhaps once everyone has spilled their
  beans a summary could be placed in the TypoWiki."

  body: "Great list Mark. I'd add to Identifont, David Johnson-Davies' Fontscape [
    http://www.fontscape.com ], which has grown nicely into a very good categorical
    reference. It's not all-inclusive, but it's helped me more than once.\r\n\r\nAlso:
    I am pleased to announce that Mark's fonts are included in the upcoming FontBook,
    along with several other foundries that were not in the last edition."

    like   \r\nRookledge\u2019s International Typefinder (some little 'problems' with
    this book: for example see page 92 - where's 292? 294? 296?; and page 93 - 301?)"

  body: "I find myself using the two Indie Fonts books from P22 very often for newer,
    and especially Techno fonts.\r\n\r\nI still have a copy of the old Precision Type
    Font Reference Guide No.5, which I think can still be found through used book
    sellers online. The thing I like about this one, even though it is a bit old,
    is that it shows the complete font in all weights. Sometimes this is the only
    way to quickly find the Italic character sets, or see a good samples of the heavier
    weights (This is one of the FontBook's shortcomings, in my opinion).\r\n\r\nFor
    all the Art Nouveau era faces that keep resurfacing as type revivals, the Petzendorfer
    'Treasury of Art Nouveau Alphabets' by Dover Books has been very handy.\r\n\r\n\"The
    Modern Encyclopedia of Typefaces 1960-90\" by Lawrence W. Wallis is a good review
    of primarily text faces from the era of film types, with complete showings and
    credits. Some of the fonts are no longer seen, and would be nice to see as revivals.\r\n\r\nThe
    old Image Club catalogs from it's last independent days (early to mid 1990's)
    still prove quite useful, as it seems many graphics folks are still using their
    old Letterpress 5.0 and 6.0 CD's. I have found many 'stumper' ID's in those pages.\r\n\r\nMark
    already mentioned most of my other main references (thanks for the Script Guide
    note), and I have all my font Library listed on my <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/FontBookList.html\"
    target=\"new\">Font Book List page</a>\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
