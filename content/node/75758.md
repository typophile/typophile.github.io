  recognise a font!\r\n\r\nHere is my problem I'm part of a tiny french sport club
  with no money. And we asked on a design forum for a free logo. Everything went good,
  we have our new logo. But now I want to design a web site around this new style,
  but can't get any answer from the guy who designed the logo to get the name of the
  font he used!\r\n\r\nI went through every web site I found with any recognition
  device but none of them gave me the good font. So I guess you are my last chance...\r\n\r\nHere
  is our logo\r\n\r\nhttp://dwi6.free.fr/CrystalXP/[WIP]StrasKang_05.png\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help."

    a clumsily customized or amateur font (stroke weights are all-over the place/funky
    placement of serifs), so I'd recommend swapping out the font for a better drawn
    one. A good alternative could be Insignia.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/insignia/\r\n\r\nIf
    you are set on continuing to use this font, my best bet would looking at DaFont. "

  body: "Wouaw, thanks a lot Renko! I was really scared it could be a custom one as
    Seb said. I was thinking as well that the serifs were weird. \r\n\r\nOne question
    how do you do to recognise the fonts? Do you use softs or is it only because you
    knox plenty of them?!"
