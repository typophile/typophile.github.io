body: Hi, I am new to the Typophile community, nice to meet you all! <BR>I have been
  working on a logo for a company named AC Wireless yesterday and i would like some
  feedback on what you think of it. Do u like the design of the logo, any suggestions
  are welcome. <BR>For the name of the company, i have not started on making a unique
  logotype for it and so i just used the fonts that are installed on my computer.
  What do u think of the font choices, which is the best out of the three? Should
  i use another font instead?   <BR>Please give comments, thank you! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13287.jpg"

    Also, what is the hash mark for in the name? <BR> <BR>

  body: miu_miu, you are not going to be able to use ATM any more, it doesn&#39;t  <BR>work
    in OS X. You will have to manage your fonts by hand or get  <BR>another font management
    utility, like FontAgent Pro, Suitcase, or Font Reserve. <BR> <BR>Do a search in
    the Forums, there has been a recent thread on the subject. <BR> <BR>Good luck!

  body: In the mean while, i would like to know if it&#39;s possible to use the fonts
    in ATM delux, is there a way to move them out and hand manage some of it on OS
    X?

    pdf</a> on the subject.  <BR> <BR>You can, basically, drop your fonts in the fonts
    folder inside users&#62;name of user&#62;library

  body: 'I like the fact that you are using one color. But are you certain you always
    want to have the text reversed?? Also, try to give the logo a bit more character,
    a little less generic. It really reminds me of a pair of old airwalks I had circa
    1989 &#40;the enclosed &#34;A&#34; logo, not to be confused with airwalk&#39;s
    shoestring man&#41;. <BR>I geuss what Im trying to say is, I want to see the logo
    and have a sense of technology, or mobility, or freedom &#40;wireless&#41;.  <BR>Can
    you explain why you are using the encircled A? What factors about the company,
    or their product, or the feelings their products gives you when you use them led
    you to arrive at this conclusion-- <BR>Communicate to me why I should use that
    company too. Right now: mashed potato sandwich.   <BR> <BR>and say no to hash'
