  body: Bob's find of Yorkville is as close as I have seen. But, based on a reasonably
    thorough search, my opinion is that this probably does not exist as a publicly
    available font. In particular I have not spotted the combination of a vertical
    leg on the _R_ like Helvetica but without the little kick at the bottom, _G_ with
    a rounded lower rhs and no spur like a compressed Futura, _W_ with a vertex that
    is at only about two-thirds of the letter height, and an _S_ with extended terminals
    similar to Helvetica. Plus the the base of _A_ is as wide as _O_.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UnknownSansTypophile117504D_6116.jpg]
    Futurvetica anyone?

  body: "If I had to duplicate the letters I might blend Helvetica Com Narrow and
    Helvetica Com Narrow Bold [img:sites/default/files/old-images/HelveticaNarrowInUse_4409.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/
    to get a matching weight and edit as required.\r\nDon"

  body: I am amazed at the number of people who only use PhotoShop for layouts and
    find it very easy to alter fonts, thus we have a large number of things out that
    are not "pure" fonts anymore. Erase and a slight blur to cover your tracks - makes
    for a tough identification.
