  to create a PROPER Yiddish font, since I\r\n type a whole lot in that language.\r\n\r\nI
  won't go into details now.\r\n\r\nI am trying to use Font Creator to make the font.\r\n\r\nBut
  I have a whole lot of problems.\r\n\r\nI want to use the font with Microsoft Word\r\n\r\nI
  need a lot of help, especially with the left to right - right to left problem.\r\n\r\nI
  have no trouble creating the glyphs I need. They are based on a simple\r\nHebrew
  font with about 10-15 additional glyphs, which are used only\r\nin Yiddish.\r\n\r\nI
  do not need any Latin characters, but I want to be able to use both\r\nupper case
  and lower case to create the needed new glyphs\r\n\r\nIf you think you can help
  me,\r\nI would VERY MUCH\r\nlike to have somebody as a kind of mentor to get me
  through this.\r\n\r\nI am willing to spend a lot of time with this, but I need some
  direction,\r\nespecially at first.\r\n\r\nContact me at\r\n\r\ncaspari@tx.technion.ac.il\r\n\r\nI
  will surely reply to any responses,\r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\n\r\nDavid Tal\r\n\r\nHaifa,
  Israel.\r\n"

    understand what you are referring to by upper/lower case.  \r\n\r\nSome info on

    <em>have</em> to make a Latin (for one thing it's certainly a ton more work) but
    since many people will need a Latin font to use alongside, you should choose an
    existing one to be compatible with in certain ways, such as color (darkness),
    apparent size (how big each script looks), etc. And if you've already settled
    on all those things, it's worth the effort finding a Latin font that harmonizes
    with your design, to recommend to people.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
