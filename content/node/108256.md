  body: Agree with Mike F about the resemblance with Blackjack. There's also another
    font which looks to perfectly match. It's [[http://summittype.com/fonts/18713/vistula.html|Vistula]]
    but copyrighted to SummitType/SummitSoft so I can't state about it's legitimacy...

  body: "Yikes, Ryuk ... that place offers tons of extremely amateurish fonts. The
    few fancy script fonts I checked seem to be very crude remakes of existing fonts
    - with lots of generated variants. See Virtuoso (Ariston) for example. Adriattica
    is clearly derived from Present - again, very crudely.\r\n\r\nI'll definitely
    be giving the benefit of the doubt to Ronna Penner of Typadelic."

  body: "Can't agree more with you, Mike. Never thought Ronna Penner could have plagiarized
    or even been inspired by Vistula. I'm pretty convinced 'Psalter' is set using
    Vistula. What I'm worrying about is, as you confirmed, SummitType/SummitSoft is
    well-known for its illegal activity. But unfortunately, I was not able to find
    the possible origin font for Vistula...\r\nThey have actually 3 different names
    for the same font: Vistula, [[http://summittype.com/fonts/16603/muranso.html|Muranso]]
    and [[http://www.whatfontis.com/Vandyke.font|Vandyke]]\r\nAnother one is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/baselinefonts/bobbi-bee|Bobbi
    Bee]] by Baseline Fonts."
