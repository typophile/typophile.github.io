  what typeface \"Bureau of Communication\" was in, as well as the titles such as
  \"Statement/Excuses\".  Thanks!\r\n"

  body: "We used a few different faces on the site, Hoeffler text is used for a lot
    of the copy in the forms, Gotham is used for the little hint text below the dotted
    lines, Helvetica Ultra Compressed for the form headlines. It's all over the place
    typographically. I was trying to make it seem old and yet new, like it was trying
    to be futuristic when made in 1933.\r\n\r\nThe design is still a bit rough around
    the edges. You'll notice that a lot of the forms change the metrics of things,
    particularly the areas on the right side. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.
    Additionally, I'd be curious to hear suggestions for how to add more variety to
    the different forms. My fear is that they'll all start to look the same in time.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n-Josh\r\n\r\nwww.MagnetismStudios.com"

    thanks for posting Josh, I think you did a great job with it.  \r\n\r\nMy only
    idea for adding variety for the forms is maybe if you could add a random adjective
    generator for some of the fields.  Oh and also if you could premade famous apologies
    in history, I think that could be really funny."

  body: Love the forms, Josh. My first thought is to use GIFs rather than JPEGs for
    the images. Your beautiful documents are showing a lot of JPEG artifacts that
    would be much less visible as GIFs.
