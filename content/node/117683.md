  who were working on it before I arrived didn't leave the text editable. Could you
  help me identify these various fonts? I found one very similar for the \"MAGICAL\"
  image (SimpleLife) but I'd like to know the original font as well, if there is one.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    letters are different)... \r\n'PRESSED' is some kind of hand-drawn [[http.myfonts.com/search/copperplate+gothic|Copperplate
    Gothic]]."

    find an exact match for the initial G, but Notera and Abuelito are close:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/notera/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/corradine/abuelito/\r\n\r\n\r\nPressed
    appears to be a distressed version of Copperplate Gothic, or possibly Copperplate

    for Magical, SimpleLife is very close. I didn't find anything as close in my search."

    As for "MAGICAL" I believe that it is indeed SimpleLife but modified.'
