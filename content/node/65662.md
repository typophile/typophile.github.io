  All the\r\ncharacters in the \"font\" are clean, broad-stroke Gothic... and then
  there is this\r\nstrange, shrunken \"zero\" with a cursive rat tail coming out the
  lower right corner\r\nWho did that?"

    and realizing that making the tail internal would be dumb?\r\n\r\nUgly does not
    equal dysfunctional. In fact, aesthetics changes constantly, while functionality
    takes much much longer. People complain about the German plate lettering. I think
    it rules.\r\n\r\nA car is not a painting. Well, except for this one:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4164643116/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    no cursive\r\nelements.\r\nIt would be nice to have a new plate design. "

  body: i concur that it's not necessarily ugly - but it is totally out of place in
    the font set, and jarringly abnormal (some Q's can be seen here http://www.15q.net/ca.html
    ) ... it's the single issue that's giving me heartburn in giving up my personalized
    MD plate (gorgeous in font and color scheme) for the equivalent CA one (hideous
    in both).
