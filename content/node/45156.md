  typesetting French we use spacing before/after punctuation marks (<i>for example
  a thin space before a</i> ! ? \xBB<i>, one after</i> \xAB). Anyone know if the same
  rules apply to spanish texts?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "In Spanish you do not use extra spacing like in French.  Here's the rules
    for the most common marks.\r\n\r\nFor quotation marks:  Las comillas se escriben
    pegadas a la primera y la \xFAltima palabra del per\xEDodo que enmarcan, y separadas
    por un espacio de las palabras o signos que las preceden o las siguen; pero si
    lo que sigue a las comillas de cierre es un signo de puntuaci\xF3n, no se deja
    espacio entre ambos.  [Quotation marks are written attached to the first and last
    word of the marked text, and separated by a space between the words or signs that
    precede or follow them; but if what follows the closing quotation mark is a punctuation
    mark, no space is left between them].  (Source: DPD \"comillas\" 1)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    please note, the prefered order for quotation marks is first angular \xAB\xBB,
    then curly double \u201C\u201D, and then curly simple \u2018\u2019.  (So many
    programs seem to figure out that in French it\u2019s \xAB\xBB\_and in German it\u2019s
    \u201E\u201C but they don\u2019t get that in Spanish it should be \xAB\xBB as
    well ... ugh)\r\n\r\nFor periods: Se escribe sin separaci\xF3n de la palabra que
    lo precede y separado por un espacio de la palabra o el signo que lo sigue [Written
    without separation from the word which precedes it, and separated by a space from
    the word or sign which follows it] (Source. DPD \"punto\" 1). El punto se escribir\xE1
    siempre detr\xE1s de las comillas, los par\xE9ntesis y las rayas de cierre [The
    period is written always after quotation marks, parentheses, and closing dashes]
    (Source: DPD \"punto\" 3.1).  Si el punto de una abreviatura coincide con el punto
    de cierre del enunciado, solo debe escribirse un punto, nunca dos [If the period
    of an abbreviation coincides with a period closing a declarative statement, only
    one period should be written, never two] (Source: DPD \"punto\" 3.3).\r\n\r\nFor
    semicolons: Se escribe pegado a la palabra o el signo que lo precede, y separado
    por un espacio de la palabra o el signo que lo sigue [Written attached to the
    word or sign which precedes it, and separated by a space from the word or sign
    which follows it] (Source: DPD \"punto y coma\" 1)\r\n\r\nThere is no simple recommendation
    on the use of the hyphen, except that all examples have it pegged to the word
    before and after it (where there is a word before or after it, of course).\r\n\r\nFor
    dashes: Cuando se usan dos rayas (una de apertura y otra de cierre) para introducir
    un inciso dentro de un per\xEDodo m\xE1s extenso, estas se escriben pegadas a
    la primera y a la \xFAltima palabra del per\xEDodo que enmarcan, y separadas por
    un espacio de la palabra o signo que las precede o las sigue; pero si lo que sigue
    a la raya de cierre es otro signo de puntuaci\xF3n, no se deja espacio entre ambos
    [When two dashes are used (one opening and one closing) to introduce an aside
    within a larger stretch of text, they are written attached to the first and last
    word in the phrase which they mark, and separated by a space from the word or
    signs which precede or follow them; but if what follows a closing dash is another
    punctuation sign, no space is left between the two] (Source. DPD \"raya\" 1).
    \ There are some complicated exceptions, but basically, when used a list, it has
    a space and then the items.  In scripts, it's NAME.\u2014Dialogue with no space
    on either side (and name in small caps)\r\n\r\nFor parenthesis: Los par\xE9ntesis
    se escriben pegados a la primera y la \xFAltima palabra del per\xEDodo que enmarcan,
    y  separados por un espacio de las palabras que los preceden o los siguen (hay
    algunas excepciones); pero si lo que sigue al signo de cierre de par\xE9ntesis
    es un signo de puntuaci\xF3n, no se deja espacio entre ambos [Parentheses are
    written attached to the first and lat word of the phrase they mark, and separated
    by a space from the words which precede or follow them (there are some exceptions);
    but if what follows the closing parenthesis is a punctuation mark, no space is
    left between them] (Source: \"par\xE9ntesis\" 1).   EXCEPTIONS: Para introducir
    opciones en un texto. [...] los par\xE9ntesis que a\xF1aden segmentos van pegados
    a la palabra a la que se refieren. En este uso, el par\xE9ntesis puede alternar
    con la barra. [In order introduce options in a text \u2026 parentheses that add
    word fragments are attached to the word which they refer to.  In this use, the
    slash may be used instead of the parenthesis] (Source: \"par\xE9ntesis\" 2.c).
    Para desarrollar las abreviaturas o reconstruir las palabras incompletas del texto
    original cuando se reproducen o transcriben textos, c\xF3dices o inscripciones.
    Los elementos que se a\xF1aden van entre par\xE9ntesis y sin espacios de separaci\xF3n:
    Imp(eratori) Caes(ari). En estos casos se recomienda utilizar con preferencia
    los corchetes. [In order to explain abbreviations or reconstitute incomplete words
    from an original text when reproducing or transcribing texts, codices, or inscriptions.
    \ The added elements go between parentheses and with separating spaces: Imp(eratori)
    Caes(ari).  In these cases, brackets are preferably used instead.]\_(Source: DPD
    \"par\xE9ntesis\" 2.d)\r\n\r\nThe slash has a variety of uses and depending on
    that use is either written with or without spaces:\r\n\r\nWithout: preposition
    substitution (1.a), multiple word options (1.b), certain abbreviations (1.c),
    dates (1.d), phonemic transcriptions (1.e), mathematics (1.i), and IT delimiters
    (1.j).\r\nWith: line breaks in quoted texts (1.f and 1.g), niche orthography uses
    (1.h)\r\n(Source: DPD \"barra\" 1)\r\n\r\nAll other bars and slashes (collectively
    called \"barras\" in Spanish, and include \\, |, ||, and //) use a single space
    on each side EXCEPT:\r\nWhen marking a page break, space before the // with the
    number or folio attached to the double slash.\r\nWhen separating a protocol from
    its address, there are no spaces with the double slash //\r\nWhen used in computer
    systems, the backslash is used without spaces.\r\n\r\nFor the bracket: Los corchetes
    se escriben pegados a la primera y la \xFAltima palabra del per\xEDodo que enmarcan,
    y separados por un espacio de las palabras o signos que los preceden o los siguen
    (hay algunas excepciones); pero si lo que sigue al corchete de cierre es un signo
    de puntuaci\xF3n, no se deja espacio entre ambos. [Brackets are written attached
    to the first and last word of the phrase they mark, and are separated by a space
    from the words or signs which precede or follow them (there are some exceptions);
    but if what follows the bracket is a punctuation mark, no space is written between
    them.] (Source: DPD \"corchete\" 1). Al desarrollar abreviaturas, no se deja espacio
    de separaci\xF3n ante los corchetes de apertura [In explaining abbreviations,
    no space is left before the opening brackets] (Source: DPD \"corchete\" 2.c).\r\n\r\nFor
    the comma: Se escribe pegada a la palabra o el signo que la precede y separada
    por un espacio de la palabra o el signo que la sigue [Written attached to the
    word or sign which precedes, and separated by a space from the word or sign which
    follows it]\_(Source: DPD \"coma\").\r\n\r\nThat's all the marks I can think of
    off the top of my head.  \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que

  body: "Theunis, if I may ask, which journal do you typeset?  \r\n\r\nHonestly the
    differences between English and Spanish typesetting are pretty minimal (of course
    here I assume the primary language is English), the main one being the quotation
    marks which is only marginally followed in Latin America (which I think those
    users from or working out of there can attest to; here in Spain it depends, the
    more formal, there more likely it's angular); and that punctuation goes outside
    of the quotation mark, which is a practice that is gaining traction in the English
    world, no doubt due to various factors including scientific and IT publication
    where having a comma in or out of a quotation may make a big difference, or just
    out of habit from programming, as well as influence from non-native writers publishing
    following the more logical system of other languages.\r\n\r\nAnother kern pair
    to watch out for in Spanish, depending on the descenders in a font is \xA1y and
    \xA1j (and possibly \xA1g).  These might need a little more space.  Another interesting
    thing that doesn't come up much... the Spanish !? or \xBF\xA1 would be simple
    opening with one and closing the other, the order depending on the meaning and
    intended delivery of the sentence.  No need for interrobang! \r\n\r\nOne other
    caveat that gets some typesetters: one used to never put accents (acute or diaeresis)
    on capital letters.  This is now considered unstandard and discouraged by the
    RAE and so they should always have their accents (the \xD1 was never effected
    by this).  The main reason was due to line and character height, so with the tilde
    you see some interesting ways to smash it into the line hieght.  With modern typography
    being almost entirely computer based, there's no real technical limitation to
    putting the accents at full height.\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to be oldfashioned
    radical, search and replace all the e\xF1es with n-macrons (esp in sans text).
