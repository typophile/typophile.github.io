  body: Century Gothic is a stand-in for Avant Garde, but with the stylistic details
    of Twentieth Century, which was a knock-off of Futura from the metal type days.

  body: "There are hundreds if not thousands.\r\n\r\nBut the line is not very clear
    between \"knock-off\" and other forms of \"similar,\" and things can get weird
    and complicated.\r\n\r\nFor example, 20th Century was a knockoff of Futura, but
    was redrawn to match the widths (and look?) of ITC Avant Garde and the result
    was renamed Century Gothic.\r\n\r\nMonotype Corsiva was drawn from the beginning
    to match the widths of ITC Zapf Chancery, yet the letterforms are sufficiently
    distinct that I don't think of it as an imitation or knock-off.\r\n\r\nBook Antiqua
    is a straight-up knock-off of Palatino, but well done, and the same companies
    (Microsoft & Monotype) also now have the original....\r\n\r\nCorel used to have
    hundreds of knock-off fonts under \"similar\" names. They changed to licensing
    from the Bitstream and URW libraries for all but a few. Bitstream has lots of
    designs that were originally unlicensed but well-executed, but often involving
    the original type designers, just not the original foundries... and then they
    got an arrangement with Linotype as well.\r\n\r\nThat's not a comprehensive list,
    and then there are cases which are more disputed.... It's a pretty wacky world
    out there.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: The great Segoe swindle comes to mind. Simply a tweaked Frutiger. Microsoft
    had an insanely bad reputation for this back in the days pre ClearType. I hope
    we won't see a repeat of the kind of behaviour.

  body: "@Clauses: We will have to agree to disagree on that. Segoe is hardly startlingly
    original, and is in the same general design space as Frutiger, but it isn't like
    they started with Frutiger and tweaked it. (If you don't mean it literally, don't
    say it, btw: there are actual living people responsible for this stuff, and you
    are accusing them of things, whether you realize it or not.)\r\n\r\nSame for Myriad,
    which is sometimes similarly accused. What's particularly interesting is that
    Segoe and Myriad are more dramatically different from each other: they differ
    from Frutiger in opposite directions from each other. Myriad softer, more humanist,
    with more angled stroke endings, Segoe harsher with more strictly vertical and
    horizontal stroke endings, with Frutiger in the middle. The Segoe approach to
    stroke endings is arguably best for text sizes on screen... I wish I could use
    it on my iPhone!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Thomas that is bordering on the laughable. Segoe is such a knock-off of Frutiger.
    Linotype, for one, agrees with me. Whether or not the "designer" is alive or not
    does not change this fact.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gothamavenir_5719.gif]\r\n\r\nI would
    never describe Gotham as a knock-off, but the similarities between Gotham and
    Avenir are undeniable. I think of them as two strong typefaces aiming at near
    targets, from different angles, that happen to resolve with similar solutions.
    But the two behave quite differently in use. And many would consider Gotham superior
    to Avenir (a debate for another time). \r\n\r\nIf we're examining visual similarity,
    it's one thing, but if we're examining the designer's intent, that's another.
    With sans serif typefaces, I often find the similarities stronger than the differences.
    Most of the differences don't really come out between similar faces until you
    start typesetting and designing layouts with them, testing their unique capabilities
    and tolerances. There's an endless stream of Frutiger-like sans typefaces out
    there, but I'm not sure they could/should all be considered Frutiger knock-offs."

    time).\r\n\r\nI think this is worth debating now. Helvetica is better than AG,
    Myriad is better than Frutiger \u2013 these fonts demonstrate innovation and creativity
    even if some traditionalists might consider them too close to the original. Inferior
    copies are easy targets. The superior ones are more difficult to critique. \r\n"

  body: "Si, can you expand on your Myriad vs. Frutiger statement? I consider them
    to be different enough that they're not interchangeable, but I don't use either
    regularly.\r\n\r\nExpanding on this topic, I find that my favorites from H&F-J
    tend to be reinventions/re-examinations/revivals of prior typefaces or styles.
    Sentinel is a good example of this. I love Clarendon, but from what I've seen,
    Sentinel looks even better. Better meaning that it takes what's great about Clarendon
    and expands on it, while adding a fresh character to it that makes it immediately
    appealing. Gotham is also a great example of this. It's so familiar in every way,
    but it still stands out."

    some of Frutiger's quirks and includes a true italic. I think the fact that Linotype
    made Frutiger Next, and Frutiger Neue kind of demonstrates an acknowledgement
    that Myriad innovated in the humanist-sans space."
