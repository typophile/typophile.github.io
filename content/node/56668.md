    I suppose if you want to use it that way you could, but those in the know would
    laugh. But then, there are very few \"in the know\" with regards to this glyph."

    this character will only come up if you are setting type in one of those three
    languages. Just like, say, an <strong>a</strong> with an acute accent -- <strong>\xE1</strong>
    -- is used by certain Latin-based alphabets, but not all of them. You wouldn't
    use it in an English text, unless you had to type a Spanish name or word, for
    example. Same goes for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eth\">eth</a>
    character."

    has a bar through it, just like the uppercase. The character \u2202 is a mathematical
    symbol with no uppercase form, but it is based on a legitimate variant shape of
    the lowercase d found in some cursive styles (this is also the normal form of
    the Cyrillic letter \u0434 in most italic styles)."

    stands for partial derivative (and hence is sometimes simply called \"partial\",

    derivative, which is symbolized by a d, and we say \"dee x by dee y\" for dx/dy."
