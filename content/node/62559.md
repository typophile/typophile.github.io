  silver metallic ink. Any thoughts/changes/tweaks? I'm debating on the placement
  of mark and supporting type in general, but I think it works where it is.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nyholt_lp_4659.jpg]"

  body: I think everything works where it is. The only comment I'd make is that the
    'A' mark looked like a script 's' to me at first.

  body: Thanks Colin. I can definitely see how you see an "s" in the mark, but that
    was actually developed a while back and is pretty recognizable at this point so
    it's not something we're looking at changing.

  body: "I would like the mark a bit more to the right for visual centering. It may
    need to be marginally smaller as well. \r\n\r\nAlso, it may be fortuitous to hack
    the \u2018www\u2019 off the URL - the resulting inverted triangle should echo
    the Adam Nyholt / photographer block above it, and also help with a slight lack
    of \u2018air\u2019 at the lower edge of the card."

  body: "the font used for photographer and the rest looks a little bland. but especially
    for photographer\r\n\r\ntell me more about why you decided to put the three bars
    of info in that order... did descending from the shortest to longest line length
    look so bad? is the order based on what the client wants communicated or are you
    trying to achieve a more squared block of info?  for some reason it seems out
    of place to me, but i'm not sure of the solution"
