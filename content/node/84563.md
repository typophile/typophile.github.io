body: "I'm in the process of planning out a new type family and I'd like it to cover
  as much of the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts as is practical (i.e. in modern
  use - I'm not too worried about ancient or archaic languages). Looking through the
  Unicode Standard, I realize just how little I really know about the Latin script
  alone! So I'm trying to sort through the various code charts to figure out which
  characters I need.\r\n\r\nI already know to include all the characters in Basic
  Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, and Latin Extended-A. I know the basic diacritics, punctuation,
  \"letterlike symbols,\" etc. I can identify the basic necessities for the Greek
  and Cyrillic scripts. But beyond that I'm lost. The following is a list of Unicode
  pages I'm interested in. Any advice on which to include and which to ignore would
  be great.\r\n\r\nLatin Extended-B, -C, -D, & Additional\r\nIPA Extensions\r\nSpacing

  body: "Tucker,\r\n\r\nsome of your doubts were mine some time ago.\r\n\r\nDo the
    contrary: define which languages you want to support and then include the proper
    characters. Unicode blocks are heterogeneous and the Latin ones brings together
    glyphs needed to less common European languages besides Asian languages, Medieval
    characters and even Roman signs.\r\n\r\nFor example: Latin Extended Additional
    includes 1E9E, the German uppercase double S. It seems ok to include that. In
    the same block you find the Vietnamese accented and double-accented vowels. Of
    course, you would ignore them if Vietnamese support is out of your target. This
    Unicode block also adds several precomposed combinations to support Indic, Hebrew
    and Cyrillic transliterations. Again, you must chose if transliterations would
    be supported.\r\n\r\nA similar definition must be made about Phonetic alphabets,
    currency and letterlike symbols. This will take some research, but you will not
    include unnecessary glyphs.\r\n\r\nSome basic information about the blocks you
    did mention:\r\n\r\n<strong>01. Latin B</strong> has mostly glyphs to African
    languages, but also mix rarely used European glyphs and Pinyin transliteration.\r\n\r\n<strong>02.
    Latin C</strong> brings glyphs to Cyrillic transliterations and old African orthographies.
    2C6D and 2C70 are needed to complete African support, the remaining probably are
    out of your scope.\r\n\r\n<strong>03. Latin D</strong> has many Medieval additions
    and support for old orthographies. Probably the whole block is unnecessary to
    you.\r\n\r\n<strong>04. Latin Additional</strong> is a mess. Define the languages
    and look in detail this block.\r\n\r\n<strong>05. IPA and Phonetic block</strong>.
    Just needed to phonetic support.\r\n\r\n<strong>06. Super and subscripts</strong>.
    Add the whole block.\r\n\r\n<strong>07. Currencies</strong>. The very basic set
    is: dollar, cent, pound, yen, currency (generic) and euro. An improved set also
    includes thai, c\xF3lon, naira, won, new sheqel, kruvinia (hryvnia), tenge, new
    rupee (20B9) and tugrik. Most of others are historical.\r\n\r\n<strong>08. Letterlike</strong>.
    n\xBA, liter, estimated, TM, and Ohm are basic. Others may be included or not
    according to your scope, but are not essential.\r\n\r\n<strong>09. Punctuation</strong>.
    Basic: 2002, 2003, 2013, 2014, 2018 to 2022, 2026, 2027, 2032, 2033, 2039, 203A,
    and 2044, \r\n\r\nThe thread where I [[http://typophile.com/node/67787#comment-402703|presented]]

    read (or at least skimmed through) a dozen or so threads, I am thinking I'll probably
    cut back on my original plans and stick to a more standard set of characters.
    Unfortunately, I do not have your skill nor your dedication! (Given how long you've
    been working on Palimpsest, I'd probably need at least ten years to do a project
    that size!)\r\n\r\nFortunately, there seem to be plenty of good examples for \"semi-extended\"
    character sets in Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic. And if I ever become ambitious enough
    to attempt full Latin support, I will certainly look to your Palimpsest and Mr.
    St\xF6tzner's Andron to get a better idea of the glyphs I would need.\r\n\r\ntypodermic:
    Thanks for the heads-up on those characters."

    excellent \u2013and already a huge project. Just note the position used in Minion
    for Vietnamese circumflex+grave (e.g., 1EA6) is not the preferred one.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your kind reference to PProject. Actually, it did born much smaller, but the
    curiosity did not let me stop at a proper size. It would be more logical to start
    with a narrow target and slowly make it wider \u2013as you plan to do.\r\n\r\nYou
    already identified a wonderful source of research: Andron is a masterpiece and
    its support (including a large medieval set still not present in Unicode) is the
    result of a deep knowledge. Other good source is Gentium, from SIL.\r\n\r\nHope
    to hear good news about your font in a near future."

    Adobe Latin-5 plus additional glyphs to support less known languages (African,
    native American). A number of tricky diacritical combinations were also added
    as precomposed glyphs (for example: letters with line below, 0332, where the line
