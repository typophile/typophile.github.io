		<div class="commentbody">The company is being developed now, waiting for the permits etc, and I´ll be involved in the copy side of the onboard magazine. The ships might be sailing some time next year, but in the first quarter of 2011 the editorial team for the onboard magazine needs to be ready preparing the launching issue. As I said, my area is coordinating writers and translators. I love design, and have been register on this forum for a long time, but only to educate my eyes&hellip; I´m a translator and a storyteller. I´m sure the designer (whom I asked to join this forum) will have his own ideas etc but what I´ve notice in this &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; (using Seth Godin´s concept) is the good level of collaboration and support. 
I´m sure not being clear got the deserved &ldquo;Comic Sans&rdquo; suggestion  upthread.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>adiazpaz, the problem was that your original question was way too broad. As far as I know there isn&rsquo;t some group of fonts that is specifically appropriate for ferries.</p>
<p>You said it&rsquo;s a new company under development. Your company will need to develop a complete visual identity system, including a logo, fonts, color palette, stationery, formats for ads, signage, etc., and hopefully all these elements will work harmoniously together, and will be applied consistently to your ships as well as your printed materials, website, and advertising.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a lot of work! It will require you to carefully consider what image you want to project, how you&rsquo;re going to differentiate yourself from your competition, and so forth.</p>
<p>And going back to your original question, in order to recommend fonts, folks here would need to know a lot more specifically about the image that you&rsquo;re trying to project.</p>
<p>A good starting point might be for you to collect images and printed samples from other ship companies to find examples both good and bad to study, and to see what your competition is doing. My guess is that some of the best examples would come from large cruise lines that have big budgets, and while your budget might not be in the same league you might get some good ideas from their examples.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks. I´m a close friend of the CEO,  and as far as I know the company is finishing their negotiation on permits from both Cuban and American governments. I dont think they are yet at  a stage where they have a clear corporate image, colourscheme, etc. (and their current logo is really bad! as it´s the few documents they have prepared for investors andthe officials in charge of granting permissions&hellip; ´The coreteam at the moment are businessmen, not creatives. Ill soon´be meeting  the marketing director, who is going to be my inmediate boss. I was told about him being asked to join the project a couple of days ago.  I insisted to my friendthe importance on having a good marketing director, and I offered myself to  be one of the two editors of their onboard magazine. The other editor and the graphic designer are close friends of mine, and though the designer is very experienced I asked here looking for some sort of recommendations on fonts to use (or avoid)  to pass on the info to my friend. As I said upthread I´ll be more involved in the selection of copy and translation (it´s going to be a bilingual magazine).</div>

<p>If management hasn&rsquo;t given that much thought, it may fall to the marketing director and his team to define it, based on their understanding of management&rsquo;s goals. But it needs to be careful thought out, and it&rsquo;s essential that the CEO agrees with the direction the creative team is taking.</p>
<p>For example, you wouldn&rsquo;t want a marketing team to create a visual identity that&rsquo;s young and hip, and then find out the CEO wants a more traditional image that appeals to an older crowd. Or create an onboard magazine aimed mostly at tourists, and then find out that your CEO is aiming mostly for business travelers. Etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, at this first stage (untill a change of the US law and all Americans -other than those of Cuban origins- can visit Cuba) most passangers are going to be Cuban-Americans, with the exception offew who can travel to Cuba with an OAFC permit. Of course the aim is that once the ban is lifted (which seems likely, sometime next year) many US tourist might be going to Cuba and together with theexisting regularflights they´ll have theseferries from Port Evergaldes andKey West to Havana. So I guess is mostly family visits, on the first wave, and general  tourists later on.  The CEO is my friend and he listens to everything I say. I sort of advice him or other issues&hellip;</p>
<p>As I said I haven´t yet met the new marketing director and I don´t know which strategies he thinks to implement, but the CEO wants a &ldquo;modern&rdquo;, &ldquo;21stCentury&rdquo;  look  -whatever that means.</p>
<p>At the moment I´m working on likely themes for the mothly magazine (around seasonal events, Havana´s cultural calendar etc), creating a pool of writers etc. My question was just to get ideas on fonts to pass it on the likely designer for the magazine -whom I chose because of friendship and think that´d make a better way of working. The CEO wants me to edit the magazine (the idea of having an onboard magazine was mine)  and asked me to form my own team.</p>
