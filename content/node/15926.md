body: "I finally got some time to work with the latest release of FontLab, and encountered
  a problem. When I used the Generate Glyph function, everything worked fine/as usual
  <em>except</em> that the accented lowercase i composite characters used the regular
  i instead of the dotless i. The latter is named <strong>dotlessi</strong> and is
  mapped to Unicode #0131, so I'm puzzled: did I do something wrong, or is this a
  bug in the new program?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when I tried to logo onto FontLab's
  website at 13:15 on 30 October, I got this message...\r\n\r\nDB function failed

  body: "Nick,\r\nthing is... When you make an \"iacute\", what you get is \"i\" +
    \"acute\". The \"i\" has its dot up there to begin with. Try this:\r\nCreate the
    dotlessi glyph.\r\nGlyph / Generate Glyphs... \r\nThen in the field ask for dotlessi+acute.\r\nVoila!\r\n\r\nThere
    is a file on you hard disk which is used to build glyphs. It is called \"alias.dat\",
    and you can use it to define your glyph-generation rules. So, you can start with
    your Eth by having the following \"recipe\" in your alias.dat: Eth D+hyphen\r\n\r\nThat
    will copy the outlines from the D and the hyphen, which you can then decompose
    and tweak to get what you want.\r\n\r\nHope that was helpful, c"

  body: "<em>Please describe what exactly you did, step-by-step</em>\r\n\r\nThanks,
    Adam. After adjusting metrics, etc., I selected <em>Generate Glyphs</em>, then
    chose the file I had been using (successfully at all times) with FontLab 4.6.
    The contents of the file are...\r\n\r\nAgrave,Aacute,Acircumflex,Atilde,Adieresis,Aring,Ccedilla,Egrave,
    Eacute,Ecircumflex,Edieresis,Igrave,Iacute,Icircumflex,Idieresis, Ntilde,Ograve,Oacute,Ocircumflex,Otilde,Odieresis,Scaron,Ugrave,
    Uacute,Ucircumflex,Udieresis,Yacute,Ydieresis,Zcaron,agrave,aacute, acircumflex,atilde,adieresis,aring,ccedilla,egrave,eacute,
    ecircumflex,edieresis,igrave,iacute,icircumflex,idieresis, ntilde,ograve,oacute,ocircumflex,otilde,odieresis,
    scaron,ugrave,uacute,ucircumflex,udieresis,yacute,ydieresis,\r\nzcaron (spaces
    have been added to keep the above string from flying off the page).\r\n\r\nAs
    I said, there was a character named <strong>dotlessi</strong> and it was mapped
    to Unicode #0131, as it had been in the past, but the generated glyphs used the
    regular lowercase i -- not a problem to decompose the character and delete the
    dot, but a minor annoyance and a sort of puzzlement. Re: Chester's comments --
    there IS an <strong>alias.dat</strong> file in my old FontLab 4.6 folder under
    <strong>Mapping</strong>, but there is no such folder nor file in the FL5 folder.
    Do I need to copy and paste some files?"

  body: "Nick,\r\nthere is only one alias.dat file, so that's the one to monkey with.
    (Tip: copy the original alias.dat, and rename it somehing like \"aliasdatsafe\".)
    I've got a couple of generations of FontLab running at the moment, hence any confusion
    about location. and at a certain point the app started to use a folder in the
    User/Library/Application Support directory.\r\n\r\nIf your dotlessi doesn;t have
    its Unicode index, that shouldn't matter for this exercise. You need to make sure
    to request this:\r\n...e+dieresis dotlessi+grave dotlessi+acute dotlessi+circumflex
    dotlessi+dieresis,n+tilde...\r\n\r\nIf you ask for the \"i\", that's what FL is
    going to use; it's not smart enough to use the fotlessi. (I also create a dotlessj
    glyph which is referenced when making the jcaron and jcircumflex glyphs.)\r\n\r\nBest,

  body: i think there are some screwy combos in the alias.dat file, i think this is
    one of the more frequent ones that users will encounter. it's easy enough to change
    the alias file, as outlined above, but some combos should definately be fixed.
    i guess the best thing to do would be to contact FontLab directly concerning screwy
    automatic composites.

  body: Thanks for all the input. I checked the OPTIONS tab (which I probably should
    have done in the first place) and found that the common files for all FontLab
    applications on my computer were in a non-existent folder under Documents and
    Settings. I just changed the path to the existing FL4 folder, and things work
    fine.
