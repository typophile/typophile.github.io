  body: The exact match is [[http://www.whatfontis.com/D730-Deco-Regular.font|D730
    Deco]] but I really doubt about its legitimacy... As alternative, you should [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/geodezyx-nf|Geodezyx
    NF]], the only difference for this lettering would be /a (which should be not
    hard to reproduce).
