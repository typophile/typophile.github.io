  body: 'dutch - interesting choice for ORANJE then. <BR> <BR>it might be fun to fill
    the space in J with your orange dots instead - just to unify things. '

  body: Props for drawing your own letters! <BR> <BR>I can see that you are trying
    to relate the a and e. Typically this is done by giving them &#40;optically&#41;
    the same amount of counter. In other words, consider making the the bowl of your
    a very small &#40;like the eye on the e&#41;, or the eye of the e very large like
    the bowl on the a. I&#39;d actually meet somewhere in the middle. <BR> <BR>Try
    bar &amp; restaurant in caps. Maybe even extended caps for a little contrast.
