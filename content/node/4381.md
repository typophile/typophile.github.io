  body: I&#39;m curious about Chinese fonts, though I&#39;ve not collected any.  Actually,
    I&#39;m very interested in Chinese design and traditional calligraphy.  I&#39;d
    be curious as to how type fonts are informed by the mechanics of calligraphy &#40;stroke
    order and direction&#41;.   <BR> <BR>Do you know the language?  I&#39;ve seen
    design that makes use of the pictographs and ideographs and forms images from
    them.  Do you know what I mean?

  body: I know a very little bit of chinese &#40;one doesn&#39;t learn so much in
    three semesters&#41;, and I know even less about chinese fonts. <BR> <BR>However,
    I do work with them occasionally. OpenType together with InDesign sets them very
    nicely. I&#39;ve taken text out from Word of PDF files that were typed on chinese
    PCs without any problems. <BR> <BR>Still, I&#39;m limited to what ships standard
    with Adobe, Apple, or MS products. I wouldn&#39;t know how to tell a quality face.
    Most of the time, I pick whichever of the faces resembles the latin-based face
    that I&#39;m using at the moment, since the documents that I make with chinese
    are always at least 50% english or german.

  body: 'Chinese fonts r divided into 2 sets: traditional chinese &#40;for TW, HK
    markets&#41;, and Simplified chinese &#40;for PRC, S&#39;pore&#41;. Esssentially,
    the origin is the same, the former having more complicated strokes. <BR> <BR>Each
    version then breeds 2 very diff sets of font characteristics. I pefer the TC,
    they look more modern, cleaner and take away the offending serifs from the sans
    serif group. <BR> <BR>to look at it another way, each chinese character not only
    has a meaning but itself is an unique  graphical icon. There r 26 roman alphabets,
    but more than 20,000 chinese words. it&#39;s madness though the use of it in design
    is almost unlimited. <BR> <BR>Monotype has nice Chinese fonts &#40;both TC and
    SC&#41;, diversifying into Chinese serifs and sans serifs, plus decor, round-edge
    fonts. <BR> <BR>variety is limited, due to the ardous task involving the design
    of the typeface which has just too many characters to consider. '

  body: Traditional and simplified characters do not have the same &#34;origins&#34;
    at all! Traditional characters have been in use for thousands of years, while
    simplified characters were a product of Mao&#39;s reforms during the 1950s. I
    heard a great lecture once by Chris Vermaas, in which he talked about the birth
    of simplified characters. <BR> <BR>Imagine, he said, if Bill Clinton&#42; were
    to announce that, as of tomorrow, the US would no longer permit the use of the
    horizontal strokes within the Roman Alphabet. He said that Mao attacked the ancient
    chinese writing system, &#34;like a madman with scissors.&#34; <BR> <BR>Unfortunately,
    almost the entire PRC &#40;and Singapore!&#41; use SC, while only Taiwan and HK
    use the traditional characters. So, the days of traditional characters are probably
    over. <BR> <BR>I was surprise to hear you say that the TCs appear more modern
    to you, since they are older, but hey. They look good. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;Bill
    Clinton was still US president at the time of the lecture.

  body: They are of the same origin cos essentially they belong to the same language,
    with one being morphed or modified to give it the simplified look, and simpler
    to write. thatz what i mean. <BR> <BR>TC looks modern if u look at Dynafont&#39;s
    example. <BR>The strokes are of uniform thickness, and less angular. <BR> <BR>i
    can give examples if u guys r keen.

  body: The above is just a comparison of two different typefaces. A designer could
    easily design an SC face with flared terminals. A more intersting comparison to
    see would be SC interpretations of TC characters with, say, 20&#43; strokes. But
    even there, every designer will make his own slight take on the characters. Thanks
    for the post, though! It would be neat to discuss more east asian type design.

  body: 'question: any chinese fontographer here? <BR> <BR>1. why would one design
    a SC with serif patterns &#40;as with the above example&#41; while there&#39;s
    an absence of serif in TC words &#40;whose design i prefer&#41;? Both are the
    english equivalent of a bold sans serif type &#40;we called it &#34;Da Hei&#34;
    , bold black&#41;. i suspect it&#39;s for ease of reading. <BR> <BR>wanna see
    how a 20&#43; stroke word simplify itself in SC form? here is it. The word means
    &#34;feel&#34;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/35756.jpg"
