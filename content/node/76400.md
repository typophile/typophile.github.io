body: I'm using the Hypatia Sans Pro typeface in Illustrator and can't for the life
  of me figure out why when I type a 'T' and a 'h' together the program treats it
  as one letter and will not allow me to adjust the kerning.  I display the typeface
  in Fontcase and a space exists nicely. What gives?  Thank you in advance for helping
  me with this.

    no doubt.\r\nThe OpenType feature spec allows that it's up to the foundry publishing
    a font to decide whether a ligature in it should be on by default (liga), or discretionary
    (dlig).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm\r\n\r\nA
