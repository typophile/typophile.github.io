  2 & Pro\r\nDesigned by [[Eric Olson]] 2002\u20132005\r\n\r\nBryant 2 and Bryant
  2 Pro are the completely re-drawn and updated versions of our original [[Bryant]]
  series released in 2002. Initially a simple family of four fonts modeled around
  the popular Wrico lettering kits used by draftsmen and amateur sign makers in the
  1960s and \u201970s, Bryant 2 & Pro is now an expansive family of fonts for anything
  from worldwide branding projects to simple one-off posters."
