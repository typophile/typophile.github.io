body: "Hey everyone, I'd like to introduce a fresh new face from Niramekko. Plau is
  the name and it's available at MyFonts: http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/niramekko/plau/\r\n\r\nThe
  description:\r\nFuturist typeface from the programming era, Plau is a sans-serif
  with rounded corner personality and interestingly deliberate lettershapes. Comfortable
  in headlines, reads surprisingly well in longer passages of text.\r\n\r\nAlso looks
  quite interesting on the screen.\r\n\r\nHope you guys like it.\r\nCheers\r\nRodrigo\r\n"

  body: "@Nick Shinn\r\nThanks! In my newbie head a font should only be worth more
    when it came with more OT features and more characters \u2013 which I now know
    it's totally not the case.\r\n\r\nI might review that in the near future and as
    more weights become available and the family gets more substantial. I was always
    bummed to release a font with only one weight. But I'm also learning as I go,
    and wanted to put it out there and see the reaction in terms of people noticing
    it or even buying it. I for one am too anxious to see how it goes, and maybe that's
    not the right approach :)\r\n\r\nQuick update on Avos' logo: the A and V are Brandon
    Grotesque's Vs and OS are Plau (O having a modified with)."

    I was very into thin weights and also wanted huge contrast so thin  came first
