  body: "Don's suggestion of Relampago is a pretty good out-of-the-box alternative.
    For what it's worth, I don't think this design is available as a font rather a
    type treatment and on [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic|Avant-Garde

  body: "Many thanks Ryuk. The lettering is very structured -- one of the best minimalist
    neon styles I have seen The video is very informative about the lettering. It
    shows details confirming that it has rounded ends [img:sites/default/files/old-images/M_4275.jpg]
    how he cut out the letters, and how he made a neon tube style sign -- heating
    glass to bend it, wiring etc. -- and the sign in use. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/WELCOME2_6056.jpg]\r\nThe
    formal lettering and sign might seem somewhat  out of place with the rest of the
    installation, which definitely lives up to its claim of being bizzare, but perhaps
    that was the artist's intention. I wish him success in his career.\r\nDon"
