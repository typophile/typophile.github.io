  (9 k)</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-/Attachment-!> <BR>Verona is a typeface in development
  for a corporate client. I&#39;ll soon be creating an italic for it, and am considering
  an upright script concept. Verona features square punctuation that is shared with
  a sans serif that I&#39;ve also designed.  <BR>I&#39;m thinking of designing the
  italic/script so that it could be shared between Verona and the sans. <BR>In respect
  of the use of Verona, I hope it to fulfill the same role that the Apple Garamond
  has done for Apple.  <BR>I&#39;m also thinking about adding more weights, but Apple&#39;s
  successfull use of one weight leads me to believe that as part of a corporate identity
  it would be stronger and more identifiable if there were only one.'

    with your work of the 1990&#39;s. I like your new face a lot and would encourage
    you to design the script and perhaps even a semi serif. '

  body: ' Miles, very nice - although you should know that I have a weakness for narrow,
    rigid designs. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s hard to make significant suggestions to something
    of such high professional finish &#40;noting for example the slight taper in the
    lc &#34;v&#34;&#39;s thin arm&#41;, so I&#39;ll go into &#34;super-picky&#34;
    mode - which does however mean that my suggestions might hold &#91;even&#93; less
    water than usual. <BR> <BR>The lc Letterforms: <BR>I like the strong square terminals.
    And the vertical proportions seem to be well matched to the narrowness. Maybe
    the descenders could be a bit shorter. The half-serifs seem to be completely flat,
    as opposed to the full-serifs, which have a slight concavity. Maybe go flat for
    all. Also, I think either the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;u&#34; foot serifs should be
    flat, or the &#34;d&#34;&#39;s should turn up instead. The &#34;a&#34; is very
    classy. The &#34;e&#34; might benefit from a stronger top-right curve, and the
    strong terminal seems to be closing things up too much. The &#34;g&#34; is one
    of the best bicameral forms that I&#39;ve ever seen - very elegant - maybe a bit
    too humanist here? The ear could be stronger. The dots on the &#34;i&#34; and
    &#34;j&#34; &#40;and maybe even the period&#41; are really too sharp, but I don&#39;t
    know what would work here - maybe rounding the corners a bit. I like strong tails,
    so the &#34;j&#34; is somewhat of a turn-off &#40;although it contrasts nicely
    with the &#34;y&#34;&#41;. The &#34;k&#34; doesn&#39;t seem to fit just right:
    it&#39;s too busy at the base &#40;you might consider giving it the staggered
    arm structure that the UC has&#41;, and the upper arm&#39;s flare on the left
    seems too humanist here. On the other hand, the &#34;k&#34; you have is a very
    classy form, which does go with the overall feeling - so if you keep it as is,
    you might want to make the UC &#34;K&#34; have similar armature &#40;not that
    I think that type of consistency is critical&#41;. The &#34;m&#34; might not need
    to be so narrow. The &#34;r&#34; might benefit from a stronger beak, and maybe
    a longer righthand foot serif to go along. The &#34;s&#34; is amazing - like a
    beautiful boa. The &#34;t&#34; initially bothered me, but now I like it a lot.
    I think the &#34;x&#34;&#39;s lower-left arm being pulled in like that is unbalancing
    it. The &#34;y&#34; is superb - my attempt at a &#34;y&#34; of that structure
    for Patria was a fiasco. The &#34;z&#34; is class. <BR> <BR>The UC letterforms:
    <BR>Very solid, without being brutal. The &#34;B&#34; -always a challenge- is
    masterful. The &#34;G&#34; might benefit from a double-serif. The &#34;J&#34;
    was bothering me, but now it&#39;s fine. The &#34;M&#34; has a problem with being
    too frail and open. You probably want to control its width in this design, but
    I really think the middle part has to go lower. The &#34;P&#34; is classy, but
    a bit recessive. The &#34;Q&#34; -which I should probably reserve judgment on
    until I see it in text- is a sharp attempt &#40;noting the modulation of the body
    at the bottom-right&#41;, and I guess you want to keep it above the baseline,
    but I&#39;m not sure you can get away without bringing part of the tail inside.
    The &#34;R&#34; is killer. The &#34;S&#34; seems to be leaning rightward. The
    &#34;T&#34; is nice and narrow, but the &#34;V&#34; maybe too narrow. The &#34;W&#34;
    has a milder version of the &#34;M&#34;&#39;s problem, and it also seems to be
    skewed left on the inside. <BR> <BR>The numerals really work, man. The &#34;5&#34;
    is amazing. Just the &#34;4&#34; is a bit too shy for me. The &#34;fl&#34; seems
    a bit tight, and I worry about its strong corner &#40;top-right&#41;. The BP seems
    to be leaning rightward. The &#34;@&#34; is surprisingly nice. Have you thought
    of making the asterisk upside-down &#40;to draw more attention&#41;? <BR> <BR>The
    spacing is probably not finished, but it seems a hair to loose to me &#40;especially
    in the rounds&#41;. And the blank space character relatively too narrow. Nice
    quote, btw. <BR> <BR>I think the single italics idea is really great, but I have
    to see a working upright one before I&#39;m convinced of that aspect of it. The
    closest &#40;viable&#41; thing I&#39;ve seen is Majoor&#39;s Seria, and assuming
    it actually works in context, it still has a slant &#40;which actually varies,
    between about 1-2 degrees&#41;. A couple of &#42;nearly&#42; upright italics &#40;~4
    degrees&#41; that do work are Gill&#39;s Joanna and Unger&#39;s Flora. G Noordzij
    might have made something, but I&#39;d be surprised if it&#39;s non-calligraphic
    enough to work for text. <BR> <BR>Your point about the one weight is interesting.
    I think it might have great validity for large settings, but for subheads and
    such it might backfire. One place where multiple weights definitely help is when
    you&#39;re mixing different sizes together but want to maintain color &#40;like
    in simulating smallcaps&#41;. <BR> <BR>Overall, great stuff - no surprise. I hope
    the client deserves the high craftsmanship. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' In Fellow Designer&#39;s defense: Melior was the first thing I thought of
    as soon as I saw this design. It really is too close. I don&#39;t normally like
    to chime in with negative criticism here, but seeing as FD has started I thought
    I should speak up. If you look at the &#34;weak&#34; letters - meaning the ones
    that attract the eye for the wrong reasons - like the M, W and Q, it looks to
    me like the designer has chosen to alter the Melior originals but made amateurish
    design choices. The lc is more consistent, but when you look at the similarities
    to Melior, particularly at the tell-tale junction of the thick and thin strokes
    of the y, and of the myriad similarities in the curves and bowl/counter shapes
    of the g then what else can you conclude?  <BR> <BR>Melior is a widely used font,
    but I don&#39;t think it is so widely used as to result in it&#39;s letter shapes
    melting into the general unconsciousness of designers by osmosis in the way that
    a font like, say, Microgramma/Eurostyle has done. You can almost forgive people
    for perpetually coming out with &#34;new&#34; designs which look like that. <BR>
    <BR>Paying tribute to an earlier designer is one thing - and if you&#39;re going
    to, then surely you have to acknowledge it - but this seems to me like a blatant
    squeeze of Melior with insufficient alteration to differentiate it to be able
    to, in good conscience, call it something original. '

    This is exactly the point of this forum.  <BR> <BR>I contacted Miles Newlyn directly
    to get his work up on typophile a few weeks ago. He is one of my own favorite
    designers in the field.  <BR>For anyone not familiar with the work of Miles Newlyn,
    he has 2 typefaces distributed through Emigre, which is as far as I know the hardest
    distributor to get work accepted by in the industry, their fonts are all completely
    original designs, innovative, contemporary and of the highest standards, so I
    would say it is safe to say that Verona is completely original. I think it is
    important to consider the end user. It is a corporate client and I think there
    is a good chance they used to use something similar to Melior and just wanted
    something similar. Well that would make the challenge to design exactly that,
    a type face that is something similar and  original at the same time. I doubt
    they would be satisfied with spending $1000&#39;s of dollars for a couple of tweaks
    here and there.    <BR> <BR>I think it is valid to ask if a design is original

    a hybrid of my favorite sans faces, drawn from scratch.   <BR> <BR>I would suggest

    I think it puts the discussion in the proper context. I&#39;m not sure this is
    a particularly creative design, nor do I think that it is necessarily particulalry
    ethical, especially considering that it does derive so much from a font while
    that font&#39;s designer/estate still holds a copyright, and to date we still
    haven&#39;t seen any attribution. <BR> <BR>But I also think that if the two fonts
    were laid transparently one on top of the other, the points and curves would not
    match precisely. &#40;Check the bowl of the lc &#34;b&#34; and the structure of

    do? I&#39;m not sure, but probably not, even for non-retail work, as I suspect
    that the original designer &#40;Hermann Zapf&#41; will see no compensation for
    this extremely close use of his work. But in taking this approach, as far as I
    can tell, Mr. Newlyn hasn&#39;t done anything different than was done in the design

  body: ' I must apologise to all contributors. <BR>I&#39;m only able to get to the
    web perhaps twice a week for the pleasure of surfing and forums like typophile.
    If I&#39;d have been able to get back here sooner I&#39;d have been able to stop
    a lot of people&#39;s time being wasted. I was under the impression that the sans/serif
    etc. forums were a discussion about the aesthetic merits typography, not the issues
    of originality. <BR>I&#39;ll put a much clearer intro to my posting for Modena
    on in the sans forum soon. <BR> <BR>So here&#39;s the background: <BR>Some years
    back I was asked to produce a logotype based on Melior. The job never went ahead
    and I decided to develop the few letters into a typeface. This was called Torino,
    and after finding that that name had been used for another typeface &#40;a condensed
    serif, must have been at the back of my mind&#41;, I named it after another Italian
    city, Verona. In not nameing the typeface Melior____ or ___Melior I had obviously
    considered the design to some degree not Melior at this point, and that has been
    the discussion here. <BR> <BR>The design had been sitting on the hard drive for
    some years and I&#39;d forgotten about it. When I was approached by the client
    for which Verona is now intended, I remembered the design, and to my eye it immediately
    fitted their requirements. Only minor though important changes were made to Torino
    in aligning some design features with the sans I was also developing for the same
    client.  <BR> <BR>In posting Verona here, a far greater number of helpful suggestions
    have been made than I&#39;d hoped for, and I&#39;m certainly respectful of the
    focus that it has brought to the source of the design, Melior has some truly wonderful
    features and I&#39;ve long been a fan of the super-elipse. I also looked at Century,
    Renault, Monanti and Marconi whilst drawing Verona. <BR> <BR>Those are the details
    that come to mind at present, I bet there&#39;s something important that I&#39;ve
    missed. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m certainly don&#39;t feel worthy of the kind of defense
    my name has received above, I&#39;m a type designer that works very much as part
    of a design team, and in that sense I&#39;m not the kind of self sustaining artist
    that many of my heroes are; Tankard, Licko, Barnbrook, Blockland&#40;both&#41;to
    name but a few. The thing is, it&#39;s a huge and very confident step to say &#34;I&#39;m
    a type designer, and I&#39;ll have my own studio and do my own thing, and I hope
    people will buy it.&#34; I did that in the early ninties, and the typeface&#39;s
    that came out were pretty abstract, not the sort of designs that I can make a
    living from. Having said that, those designs and designs of that ilk &#40;Lee
    Schulz&#39;s work I&#39;m in awe of&#41; are my passion.  <BR>In what seems great
    number of years I&#39;ve been modifying existing designs for clients simply because
    very few of them have an understanding of the time it takes to do a new design,
    and throughout this I&#39;ve either arranged the proper licence myself, or have
    had to pester brand managers in countries that have much &#39;softer&#39; attitudes
    to licensing to get the proper licence. <BR>Type design is a relatively anonymous
    art at the best of times, and anyone involved in the creation of new expressions
    through the letterform deserves credit, those contributors that have raised Melior
    here are doing exactly that.I doubt we&#39;ll ever get to the wonderful copyright/credit
    model that photographers seem to have maintained. '

    I must say that I don&#39;t know what all the commocean is about. It was my understanding
    that fonts are not allowed to be copyrighted so I don&#39;t understand a mention
    of copyrights expiring. I&#39;ve heard of Zapf. His dingbats are on every Mac
    computer. So. Do you think Melior does not look like 100 other fonts. Who did
    HE copy. This is not an original font. We can trace/scan fonts from sites. What
    legally can they do. Everybody I know screen shots stuff from the typeviewers
    then does minor clean up. We are students. We are not getting paid for our work.
    When we get out in the real world we will probably do the same unless our employer
    has a lot of money sitting around. Well also there are a lot of font disks floating
    around campus. I don&#39;t know of a single student who buys fonts. So if Melior
    is copied then so what. Is Zapf going to turn over in his grave. These are letters

    <BR>&#62; It certainly need not be a shallow enterprise <BR> <BR>Agreed - and

    in a way &#34;optional&#34; in graphic design. But to be fair, the real reason
    for this might be that there really isn&#39;t that much room for all of us who

    one of the most interesting discussions I&#39;ve seen at Typophile. On the one
    hand I feel vindicated by Miles&#39; revelations about the direct link to Melior
    - although he is still short on the technical details of his work - but on the
    other hand I realize it&#39;s a  serious charge if you accuse a designer of wholesale
    &#34;borrowing&#34; of another designer&#39;s specific bezier curves and points
    and it shouldn&#39;t be made lightly.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think, however that
    we should automatically get down on our hands and knees if and when a &#42;name&#42;
    designer happens to speak up here. The Typophile forums are not like a fan club
    where, if a celebrity makes an appearance then everyone lines up to get their
    autograph and basks in the glory of their brief attention; it&#39;s more like
    &#40;I&#39;d hope&#41; a place of learning and interaction that experienced practitioners
    might frequent and be subject to interesting and sometimes difficult questions
    from the students. <BR> <BR>Back to Verona: From his words, Miles is clearly revisiting
    the design but it is not a revival but a reinterpretation. His integrity shows
    in the work itself &#40;but we could do with a sample text setting at 12 point,
    don&#39;t you think&#41; and in the fact that he came here to discuss the work.
    Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think the hard core font rip-off artists are likely
    to frequent Typophile, except perhaps for trolling, and so it&#39;s unlikely their
    &#34;work&#34; will be put under the Typophile microsope in the same fashion. '
