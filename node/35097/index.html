  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Wow. I just saw some fantastic typography all over the new Potter film. What a nice surprise to see such carefully chosen type, very much of it in the old style(s), in a movie. Newspapers, signs, closing credits - everything throughout the film - ughh. It was like porno for typos.

Film is a medium with which I have not seen type treated with this kind of attention (credits excluded - there are many wonderful examples of beautifully set credits!). Does anyone have any favorite type-showcasing films? Please share your experiences.

Feel free to include any documentaries about type, too, I guess. Many of us are familiar with the the Helv documentary (maybe even seething to see it), but I suspect there may be more out there.
<!--break-->
Best,
Ray

P.S. By the way (and my intention is not to turn this into a HP thread), but even beyond the type treats, HP5 is a fantastic film...</div>

And I remember this story breaking about the use of historical type in period films, specifically helvetica in good night and good luck:

http://typophile.com/node/17039

Finally... for now, at least... Tomato have done some excellent work in film, Trainspotting being the first that comes to mind.

But films and typography, my two all-consuming passions, rarely seem to cross paths...

		<div class="commentbody">I was going to post about this after I caught OotP, but for some reason I didn't.

The movie really did have a lot of sick type stuff to offer. Between the main transitions that were done in 3d animated, 2d pages from the Daily Prophet, to the typographic riot that were Umbridge's decrees, someone was really earning their paycheck.  Too bad I can't find any screenshots of the Prophet's sleek new redesign. In all the previous films, the main heads were done in wizard-anachronistic blackletter, but in the latest outing, most of it was done in a weathered, black, condensed sans (though the text still looked like a gnarly blackletter). It's too bad they omitted all the stuff about the Quibbler – I'd have been interested to see how it would look compared to the Prophet.

Concerning other films, for some reason the ubiquity of Gill Sans in near-future London in Children of Men struck me as a nice touch. The director, Alfonso Caurón, was also behind Azkaban, with it's sweet Marauder's Map, incidentally.

		<div class="commentbody">I got to see it on one of the biggest non-imax screens around, and those newspapers were gorgeous when seen at the size of a large house. On a higher level, the film has a generally unifed aesthetic quality of a much higher caliber than the previous four, the amount of thought and effort that went into it must have been incredible. It was a pretty inspiring movie.

Now if I could just get my hands on book seven...</div>

I think I was a freshman or so in HS when that came out.......still didn't quite know what graphic design was at the time, but definitely made me aware of type treatments within film.
