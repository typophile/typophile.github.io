body: "Hi there typophiles I was hoping that you could help me.\r\n\r\nI'm currently
  working on a little project involving ligatures and I'm struggling to find some
  nice fonts (sans or serif) that have a good amount a ligatures in them. \r\n\r\nIdeally
  I'd like something with the standard ones in and maybe ct fy f\xE4 etc. Free or
  something that I might already have would be good but I dont mind buying a nice
  font that will work. (though being a student not too expencive)\r\n\r\nSo I was
  hoping that people on here could help me out and suggest a few. \r\n\r\nthanks also
  I'm trying to make a full list of ligatures and so far I have: \r\n\r\nTh ch ck

  to add to the list that would be brilliant. (please note font suggestions dont have
  to have all of these) \r\n\r\nThanks"

    bit on the pricey side but I guess I could just get the ligatures package for
    what I want to do. Any other suggestions?

    sport huge amounts of ligatures, but I guess that's not quite what you're after.
    Jeremy Tankard's <a href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/aspect\">Aspect</a>
    is a ligature heavy sans, but it's really ugly. Also <a href=\"http://klim.co.nz/feijoa_samples.php\">Feijoa</a>

  body: "<em>I\u2019m trying to make a full list of ligatures</em>\r\n\r\nI'm trying
    to make a full list of dance steps.\r\n\r\nA ligature is a technical solution
    (one of a number of possible solutions) to implement in type the phenomenon of
    ligation in writing systems. This is understood when one realises that everything
    that involves the joining or merging of letters in writing can be described without
    using the term ligature, as varying kinds of ligation, whereas in type one needs
    a word to describe the <em>thing</em> that implements ligation, whether it be
    a piece of metal or a glyph ID in a GSUB table.\r\n\r\nA full list of ligatures
    is, like a full list of dance steps, an empirical impossibility: one can conceive
    of it, but as soon as one considers that any new type style, and certainly any
    new writing style, may lend itself to new kinds of ligation, the impossibility
    of compiling an exhaustive list of ways to implement these as ligatures is evident.
    One may compile a list of common or garden ligatures, or even rare species encountered
    in the wild, but even this is not useful unless one is also documenting the styles
    of type or writing in which they occur and to whose ecosystems they belong (sorry
    to switch metaphors from dancing to botany). I have, for example, a fairly exhaustive
    summary of the ligations that occur in Byzantine cursive miniscule, and have seen
    similar lists of those that occur in Devanagari when used to write Sanskrit, but
    these lists are particular to both style and language. The summary of Byzantine
    cursive ligation is not a 'list of Greek ligatures'; it has no general application
    to the Greek script."

    combinations don't have frequency in language: they have frequency in spelling.\r\n\r\nConsider
    the Lingua n_g ligature: it indicates no more distinction between siNGing and
    raNGoon than the unligated letters do. Or consider the word 'When' in the sample
    at the top of this page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/lingua/info.html\r\n\r\nIt
    is displayed with the glyphs W h_e n, but linguistically the h forms a consonant
    sound with the W and has no independent connection to the e as suggested by the
    ligature.\r\n\r\nI apply frequency analysis for determining sets of Devanagari
    conjunct ligatures, but in that case there are contextual layout behaviours based
    on those ligatures which differ from the layout of the same letter sequence using
    half forms, so having a good idea which ligatures are important to include is
    critical. But I've never thought of this analysis as 'linguistic', despite having
    a Sanskritist on my team."

    between the traditional criteria for ligatures (aesthetic, typographic) with its
    non-visual methodology; language, in this comparison, being implicitly non-visual.
    This core idea would not have been so well expressed if the face had been named
    Spella and character frequency explained in relation to spelling.\r\n\r\n... [in]<em>

    the \"h\" forms a frequent pairing with \"e\"--this is what is indicated by their
    ligaturing in Lingua, if any suggestion of linguistic significance is called for.
    \r\n\r\n*This is the normal usage, even though \"Spellingistically\" may be more
    accurate. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.math.uic.edu/~leon/mcs425-s08/handouts/char_freq2.pdf\">this

    forms a frequent pairing with e in English spelling. But linguistically this is
    neither significant nor interesting, because it does so in larger combinations
    whose pronunciations are unrelated -- che ghe phe she the whe etc. -- and in all
    those combination the pairing with the preceding consonant is more significant,
    in terms of what it represents in language, than the pairing with the e.\r\n\r\nIt's
    fine to use terms loosely much of the time, but when a word is used, as I believe
    it is in the case of the Lingua font, to suggest something that is not in fact
    the case -- that the font is the product of linguistic analysis --, then I think
    one needs to insist on a more precise usage in order to be able to critically
    engage with that suggestion.\r\n\r\n<em>For instance, this document is not named
    \u201CFrequency of Character Pairs in English Spelling Text\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nBut
    'English Language <em>Text</em> already implies that something other than language
    is being analysed, i.e. frequency of letter pairs in text, according to the spelling
    norms of written English. Note that this document is a handout in a mathematics
    class on cryptography, not in a linguistics class. Linguistics largely ignores
    conventional spelling."
