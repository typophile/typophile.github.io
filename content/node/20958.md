body: "My family and I have just returned home from a 4 day trip to Cincinati.  We
  had a horrid drive through pouring rain. I just checked my basement (which has never
  been wet in 20 years) and found it flooded. It is still pouring buckets out and
  is supposed to rain for the next few days here.\r\nIn an effort to take my mind
  off the frustration and damaged goods, I thought I would pose a typical Typophile
  question. What is the best face for a flooded basement.  It can't have small caps
  because they would drown. No delicate wispy fonts either.  Perhaps something along
  the lines of \"Sandbag\" or \"Mould-in-the Making\".  Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    about that soggy lower section, combined with the rage that hobo is likely to
    evoke may make it strangely appropriate..
