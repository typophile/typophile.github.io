body: "Hi there!\r\nI really hope this is the right forum to post the question in.
  I have a font called Skitch from Yellow Design. I have installed all 11 variations
  but only some of the are available in Photoshop. For example the Skitch fill version
  doesn't show. I am quite new at using an opentype font like that. I tried to look
  in the character sub menu in Photoshop but that didn't help. They show so many nice
  options on their site but I can't access them. F.ex how do you stretch the borders
  like that when they consist of two characters?\r\nHere are some links \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/skitch/\r\nhttp://yellowdesignstudio.com/fonts\r\nThanks!"

  body: I wouldn't try to do anything with type in Photoshop. In InDesign, you can
    use the OpenType menu and Glyphs palette to access all the characters you want.

    themselves aren''t appearing. My guess is that there are some internal naming
    conflicts in the Skitch family.  - Herb'

    body: I will look for an answer to the naming conflict problem. They are in the
      fonts folder but I can/t see them. When I try to install them again I get a
      message saying they are already installed. Thanks!

  body: Try it again with the font files placed in the specific Adobe-folder (Library:Application
    Support:Adobe:Fonts). Adobe is somewhat more lenient using non-standard font (types)
    than OS X.
