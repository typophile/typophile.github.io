  church is called \"New Life\" and I am looking for a typeface that is rounded and
  looks good as lower case. I have had a look through various font sites without much
  success, and I refuse to resort to something like Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nI basically
  need a modern, san serif, rounded typeface that does not look like it is drawn.\r\n\r\nAttached
  is the general feel of the logo so far.\r\n\r\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NewLifeLogo_6111.jpg]"

    mentions a few other rounded sans serifs that have been popular of late, like
    Bryant and Omnes.\r\n\r\nIt may also help to look up the keywords <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/rounded/\">\"rounded\"</a>
