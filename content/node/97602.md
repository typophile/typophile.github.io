body: "Hey Guys,\r\nWhile designing diacritics for a font I am currently working on,
  I stumbled across a small problem. When using the acute accent over A and E, the
  accent appears smaller on E (PFA image). I am purposefully using smaller accents
  (rather than the original accent character) for Uppercase letters. Is it OK if I
  modify the accent on E to make it look bigger. Is this act of rule braking acceptable?\r\n"

    you set up for stem widths, x-heights, overshoots, standard accents, et cetera
    are all only guidelines, not absolutes. If something looks too big or small, wide
    or thin, even though it follows the standards you\u2019ve set for the font, make
    the optical adjustments to make it look right.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"

  body: "I guess that's an optical illusion, which I for one had never considered*.
    Sure, the eye is king, but time is money... What I mean is, it might be worth
    ignoring that minor refinement, especially since accented caps rarely occur close
    enough for somebody to be bothered by a slight difference in apparent size.\r\n\r\n*
    You see how useful a noob can be?  :-)\r\n\r\nOne notable thing about cap accents
    though: they're often flatter than the lc equivalents, to reduce collisions with
    descenders in previous lines. People do mind that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    scripting whiz coming up with an easy-to-implement solution to the problem\u2026"

      as a good reference for designing diacritics, since almost all the diacritics
      shown in the gray images on the right of the webpages of the site are obviously
      too big or simply too tall (ok, except the bar, the hook above, the horn, ogonek,
      the ring and the accents made of dots).\r\n//Later edit: On the other hand,
      \"Problems of diacritic design for Latin script text faces\" is an excellent
      read, thank you."

    body: ":) You bet I thought about that color difference long before writing this
      \u2013 and no, it's not the contrast responsible for this \u2013 most accents
      on this \"recommended\" site really are bigger than they should. I'm a Romanian,
      I know (our) diacritics quite well, and I can spot that pretty easily for our
      diacritics: for instance, the left and right extrema points of the circumflex
      and breve in |\xE2| and |\u0103| should not share the same coordinate with the
      extrema point of the tear of |a| on the left and with the extrema point of the
      stem on the right. In other words, these two accents should always be a bit
      narrower than the upper part of |a|. Also, the comma-below of |\u0219| and |\u021B|
      (s-comma-accent and t-comma-accent, again Romanian diacritics) should most of
      the time be smaller than the sentence comma, which in the case of the grey images
      posted on diacritics.typo.cz doesn't seem to be the case, contrast or no contrast.
      That's why I consider that site to be so misleading for font designers who deal
      with Latin diacritics.\r\n\r\n//Later edit: Even if I feel my complaint about
      diacritics.typo.cz is completely warranted, maybe I'm slightly off-topic, so
      just to balance things and not mislead the original poster (typogruffer) by
      mistake, I'll just say I also agree with Nick Shinn about the accents in your
      image \u2013 indeed they are a bit too light and too close to the letters.\r\n\r\nP.S.
      I'm actually working on a \"Romanian Diacritics How-To\" PDF. Is it possible
      to post it here once it's finished?"
