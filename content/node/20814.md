    usually warn this could take a little longer. We certainly don't want to be off-putting."

  body: "I don't think these 'dotted o's' are the usual ones you may have seen, which
    would probably be Mark Simonson's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/felt-tip-roman/\">'Felt
    Tip Roman'</a>. (Notice the 'a' is the wrong style, for starters.) I also just
    scanned through the 300 Handwritten Fonts from the ClickArt CD, and this one isn't
    one of them. Dennis's (fontplayer) suggestion of searching Font Garden is not
    a bad idea, because it looks like it's a home-made font from personal printing.
    It's pretty likely, as Patty's FAQ link suggests, that this could be a one-of-a-kind
    custom font, or something you may never find among all the thousands of free fonts
    like this that are at all the free font download sites.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion as
    usual in these cases is to find something with a similar feel, and use that, because
    you may never find the original.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    your insight fellas.
