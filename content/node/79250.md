body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nI've been working on Sensato Display, which I assumed
  would be great for fashion design. However, when I compared it to Didot the contrast
  turned out to be rather mild. Underneath is are the first few glyphs from a version
  of Sensato with really high contrast. I don't know of any sans-serif with such a
  high contrast and I don't feel like it lacks serifs (That's what I expected to see),
  so I'm pretty happy with it so far. Although it's just a few glyphs, I hope you
  are able to judge it's potential. Any feedback is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,
  Jasper\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sensato-superdisplay_4324.jpg]"

  body: I don't have any technical advice, but generally speaking, I can see myself
    using this as a headline/display font for something like a high-end watch, classy
    fragrance, or up-scale alcohol ad. I don't think you can really go wrong with
    pursuing this direction.

  body: Certainly press on, but note that the premise will be trickier with letters
    other than the ones you have here. Sketching the /A/E/S/T/U/ and the u&lc diagonal
    letters will be a good test of its plausibility.

  body: "Very nice work.\r\n\r\nI really like the contrast between the sharpness of
    the terminal and the tail on the letter a with the smoothness of the bowl. The
    balance bewteen the stem and the lobe on the on the d seems just right to me.\r\n\r\nIt
    has a slight 1920s/1930s feel to it and it's stylish and clean. I can definitely
    see it becomeing a sought after font.\r\n\r\n< grins >\r\n\r\nIf you need a beta
    tester, I'm your man!"
