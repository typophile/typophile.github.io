  magazine that is on expressive and experimental typography. I was wondering if I
  could get your opinions on this subject.\r\n\r\nWhat is your definition of expressive
  and experimental typography?\r\nCan you say that every typographic work is expressive
  or experimental?\r\nWhat do you think is the context in which today's typographic
  work is created?\r\nHow do you think expressive or experimental typography is going
  to continue to develop in the next few years? What is its future? For example, web
  typography and motion type will have great developments. Handwritten type is also
  making a great comeback.\r\n\r\nI want to thank you in advance. It is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n"
