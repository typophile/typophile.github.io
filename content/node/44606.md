body: "Hi,\r\nI am developing a brochure for a client of mine and I need to use ticks
  in a table (as in tick this box). Unfortunately I am setting the document in Gill
  Sans \u2013 I am looking for a suitable tick to use that doesn't look like a comic
  version (see Zapf Dingbats, Wingdings etc). Can anyone recommend a type face with
  a sexy tick???\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nJason."

  body: You could draw a simple Gill-like tick in Illustrator and use that. That's
    what I'd do anyway.
