body: "Dear Philes and Philosophes of Type\r\n\r\nMy new design was released 8th April
  at myfonts.com. It is called Hermecito.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/artypes/hermecito/\r\nThere
  are two pdfs posted at the gallery http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/artypes/hermecito/gallery.html
  \u2013 one is A4 and the other in US Letter format \u2013 containing much information
  and specimen text settings etc. I'm attaching the A4 brochure but, as the max. upload
  is 2mb, not the US letter.\r\n\r\nKindest regards \r\nRafaeli\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hermecito5_5304.png]"
