body: hello..I found those beautiful serif typefaces in design book (and the other
  one I dont remember where I got it from:( I cant identify them. Is the first one
  Rotis semi serif and  the Socoley logo might be some sort of didot or bodoni? If
  anyone knows or like to help me, please let me know. Thank you.

  body: "It\u2019s definitely not Times <em>New</em> Roman. It\u2019s closer to plain
    <em>Times Roman</em> with a modified <strong>S</strong>. Look at:\r\n\r\n\xBB
    Top left corner in the bowl of the <strong>R</strong>\r\n\xBB The slanted top
    serif of the <strong>S</strong>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also the exact opposite of the
