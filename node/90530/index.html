Why not make what you feel like, rather than pandering to the market?
If you research what people like now, by the time your product is out it will be passé. If you attempt to anticipate where the market is heading, you are guessing.
Besides, the minority of Typophile posters actually pay for fonts, they are either font producers or looking for the free equivalent of something commercial that is presently trendy.
However, if you are attempting to take a snapshot of what’s popular now, in order to avoid duplicating that sort of thing—Respect!</div>

<p>I actually enjoy very much using Futura ND, it´s elegant (compared to Bitstream&rsquo;s or Adobe&rsquo;s) and energetic. I finally had the chance to use Caslon Big on a real project and I liked it very much.</p>
<p>If you are going to attempt doing some real typefaces for this project, I suggest doing display faces, they are much easier to complete and to sell.</p>

<p>Jobs' rare gift seems to have been the ability to make people pander to him. He did not pander though, and nothing is better proof of that than the fact that Adobe Flash has permanently been banned from Apple mobile devices regardless of the consequences. Along those lines Jobs also had a rare gift of inherently knowing what people desired when those masses of people were mistaken about their own desires. That can&rsquo;t be done using market research and focus groups.</p>
<p>The same deal may pertain here with font selection, but it&rsquo;s a daunting and daring task.</p>

<p>Which is what I said.
&ldquo;Wanted to buy&rdquo;, not &ldquo;thought they needed&rdquo;.
In fact Need is often highly opposed to Desire.
The proportion of people who actually <em>need</em>
an MP3 player or cellphone is quite low.</p>

<p>Favorite ≠ most used. The typeface I use is usually determined by factors that trump my personal desire: Client has a preexisting corporate style, how it will look on the paper/screen, does it have characters/styles I might need down the line, etc.</p>
<p>I usually buy a typeface because it is unlike anything I currently own (Cyclone, Deliscript, Paradigm), or it has significantly more features than something similar I may already have (Bookmania &gt; Bookman Old Style, Harriet Text &gt; Century Schoolbook). I&rsquo;m also a sucker for sales and discount bundles of those types of fonts.</p>
<p>Another great incentive for me is a specimen that highlights the font&rsquo;s features, describes with some detail how the design came to be, and/or recommends an ideal/intended usage (agate/display, newsprint/screen, etc.)</p>

What kind of brief is this and for what kind of student major? Is this a marketing class or a graphic design class?<br>
I assume you think of this forum as your target market?  Probably wrong assumption as others have stated.</p>
<p>If you are really doing a brief, I would first analyze who the real target market is.  Who buys type often enough to be meaningful? I am not going to tell you because that is part of your assignment. You all need to sit down and figure out away to find out.  I don&rsquo;t just mean who to ask for the answer. I mean what would be a methodology for finding any target market?  That is because you are trying to learn something useful and repeatable for your area of study instead of just finishing this assignment.  This all gets in to what drives a particular market and how far ahead you need to be thinking.  Clearly, you are too late for &ldquo;today&rdquo;. Walk a mile in the target audiences' moccasins, then bang your heads against it.</p>
