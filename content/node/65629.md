  users) for specific fonts that might \"coordinate\" well with other specific (named)
  fonts? Meaning, if I say I have fonts x, y, and z, and I need another font that
  will look good with y, and z, can someone make font suggestions here for me to go
  look at? Or tell me what general \"style\" of font would contrast nicely? Etc. I
  ask this first because I don't want to ask inappropriate stuff on the forum (new
  here), but I did see where someone else posted a similar thing and asked what fonts
  would be \"good\" together for a certain project mood and got some suggestions and
  information.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "OK, this would be for the web. The two main ideas being thrown out so far
    are:\r\n\r\n1. Starlight Hotel http://www.fontdiner.com/menu_ifm.html\r\n\r\nfor
    title-headings. But I need something to pair it with for subheadings and smaller
    titles underneath it. The main text of the articles is good ole Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.
    The other idea is using Primal Scream http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/primal-scream/
    for the big banner and again, SOMETHING ELSE for the sub-heads. Text is Georgia,
    again.\r\n\r\nThe mood is supposed to be \"mentally unstable\" 50s-60s housewives,
    if that conjures anything. Maybe like in the show \"Mad Men.\" I don't know if
    that helps, but that's *all* I have now. If anyone has a couple ideas for straitjacket-retro
    with a dash of boozy brashness, and can suggest anything for the subheads, or,
    for that matter a complete pairing, it's much appreciated. :-)\r\n"
