body: "HI guys,\r\nI've started a project called the LADproject, it's a \"letterform
  a day\" exercise. I was hoping to see if anyone else would like to join me in this
  experiment/project. The basics of it are, to \"find\" or make a letterform a day
  for 50 days. It can be found anywhere or in anything. You can make one or draw one.
  Paint one or just find one that's already made. I consider it an exercise to open
  up the possibilities of what can be considered typography, or where we can find
  typography. \r\nInspired by Stefan Sagmeister and Michael Beirut, I've dedicated
  myself to find or make a letterform a day. You can follow the progress here...http://nicolascervantes.wordpress.com/
  Post your letterforms there and also comment. Thanks guys, here's aB that jumped
  out at me today.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/b_small_4135.jpg]"

    the same token all sounds are music, anything one puts in one\u2019s mouth food.\r\nNot
    that I have anything against your proposed activity\u2014just the terminology!\r\nAt
    any rate, it\u2019s always good to see images at Typophile, as well as talk about
    type.\r\nLet\u2019s see how far you can stay this course."

  body: 'I agree with Nick: if it ain''t type, it ain''t typography. Which is not
    to say it isn''t interesting in its own right, as a way of looking at the world
    through the filter of letter shapes. And if you were to collect all these images
    into a <a href="http://www.photofont.com/">Photofont</a>, <em>then</em> it would
    be type and you could make typography, of a kind, with it.'

  body: "When I \uFB01rst started teaching type design at York University, about 10
    years ago, it was rather open-ended, meaning that students came up with their
    own ideas for typefaces\u2014and this method (photo-found letter forms) was used
    by several to kick-start their projects, generally because they weren\u2019t inspired
    directly by the world of type, not because of any Sagmeister in\uFB02uence."

  body: Very true, maybe I chose the wrong words to describe the project. I like the
    way you put it as a filter through which to see the world. It's a good filter,
    wouldn't you agree? While I do love letterforms that are traditional, this exercise
    is just to keep my mind open to the possibilities. I do like the inspiration it's
    been garnishing. In the right context, these found letterforms could work.
