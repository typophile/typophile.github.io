  following three letters. Each is stored as it's own glyph in the font file (Linotype
  Audio Pi LT Std). I think they're gorgeous, all the subtle detail on the serif.
  I wish I knew what it was!\r\n\r\nMy first guess was maybe an old icon for Dolby
  Noise Reduction (DNR) but none that I found seemed to match these characters. \r\n\r\nAnybody
  know what these are for ?\r\n\r\nAnybody know who designed them ?\r\n\r\nAre these
  glyphs part of a complete typeface somewhere ?\r\n\r\n\r\nAny info much appreciated!\r\nMoseph"

  body: Well, I can't help you with your other questions, but the characters are from
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-american-typewriter/|ITC American
    Typewriter]], also by Linotype. Or almost, at least - the serifs do look a bit
    flatter...

    are talking about the NDR, it was the old logo from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norddeutscher_Rundfunk\">Norddeutscher
    Rundfunk</a>, the logo with the walrus. "

    \r\n\r\nI'm not sure why the attachment got removed, but I'll add it here again
    for the sake of completeness.\r\n\r\nAs Eyehawk pointed out on the MyFont forum
    the N glyph has apparently been cut on the baseline from the original American
    Typewriter typeface and some additional stroke weight has been added.\r\n\r\nFrom
