  body: Perhaps something thin and more classically-based might work well as a contrast/counterpoint?
    Of course everything depends on the context. What are you trying to accomplish?

  body: I quite like din and myriad, the font is for a project about fashion and addressed
    to girls, I was looking for some fancy ones, but maybe a simple sans-serif is
    better.Thank you!!
