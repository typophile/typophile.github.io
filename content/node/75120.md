  new version 6.0]] of the international Unicode Standard is officially released.
  Among numerous additions one particular novelty might be of a more general interest:
  the encoding of a great number of <strong>public pictographic signs</strong> which
  are heavily used worldwide.\r\nThere has been one single block only so far (2600)
  providing a motley selection of miscellaneous ideograms and pictograms from various
  subjects, not to mention the notorious \u201CZapf Dingbats\u201D block (of which
  only a dozen of characters is actually of some little practical value). However,
  the more specialized sections of technical, geometrical, mathematical and arrow
  characters are already well represented by 1415 positions, in various blocks ranging
  from 2190 to 2B5x.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, \u201Ca late-breaking addition is
  the newly created official symbol for the Indian rupee\u201D, as Unicode officials
  said.\r\n\r\nThe 2600 block \u201CMiscellaneous Symbols\u201D got enhanced recently
  in version 5.2 (by 59 characters) and now got completed \uFB01nally to a total number
  of 256. But a number more than two-and-a-half times as large, 662 characters, has
  now been added in \uFB01ve new blocks of the Supplementary Plane 1. By this the
  number of encoded public symbols has become about three-and-a-half times as large
  as it was before. Left aside the 2700-block, there are now over 900 encoded public
  symbols. For the very \uFB01rst time in the history of international character encoding
  a critical amount of public signs has standard encoding, forming a reliable reference
  for font-based application. This does affect way\uFB01nding-travel-tourism as well
  as business and communication-related matters in particular.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the
  additions are:\r\n<strong>1F300</strong> (earth/planets, plants, food/beverages,
  leisure/sports, buildings; 188 characters),\r\n<strong>1F400</strong> (animals,
  people/\uFB01gurative, hearts, money/business, communication; 250 characters),\r\n<strong>1F500</strong>
  (user interface, items/tools, clockfaces; 91 characters),\r\n<strong>1F600</strong>
  (smileys; 63 characters),\r\n<strong>1F680</strong> (transport/vehicles/travel,
  hygiene; 70 characters).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/symbojet_uc6zeichen_6394.jpg]\r\n<cite>Some
  of the widely used symbols now covered by the Unicode standard</cite>\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe
  incorporation of these character sets into the standard was preceded by a long and
  laborious developing process. \r\nHowever generally known and most widely used those
  signs are, they lack something essential in terms of encoding: there is no codified
  order similar to \u201CA to Z\u201D or the like. The absence of such an order proved
  to be obstructive to encoding for a very long time, for Unicode/ISO-10646 is maintained
  according to the \u201Cnot to lead but to follow\u201D rule. That means, the bodies
  in charge do not intend to impress their own will onto the the rest of the world
  but rather aim to reflect the real-world usage by means of the standards content.
  Yet, under this presumption especially, the selection of characters in question
  rendered itself as a much debated matter.\r\n\r\nThe initiative for admitting public
  symbols on a more large scale into the Universal Character Set was notably conducted
  by Apple and Google, about three years ago. At that time, in Japan the usage of
  so-called \u201Cemoji\u201D (= emoticons) in messaging on mobile devices became
  increasingly popular. Japanese mobile phone manufacturers did implement such character
  sets for quite some time \u2013 and users liked it. Therefore, and by an increasing
  data interchange between mobile and stationary equipment the \u201Cemoji\u201D glyphs
  found their way into legacy message data. The lack of a standard encoding of these
  charcters was recognized as a stability issue. However, the existing proprietary
  standards DoCoMo, KDDI and Softbank matched each other to a considerable degree
  already, but the limitations of a PUA-based encoding scheme were obvious. \u2013
  A regular encoding was to become the answer.\r\n\r\nThe syndication of the three
  standard\u2019s mentioned was the \uFB01rst step in order to establish some kind
  of basis for a matter which just lacked an \u201CABC\u201D-like status of codification.
  It was followed by discussions about possible additions to certain character sets
  (e.g. TRAIN, BUS, \u2013> SUSPENSION RAILWAY), naming and sorting of characters
  and character sets. Even more principal matters were to ventilate. For instance,
  a set of colour-variations of one glyph (e.g. HEART) had to get acommodated into
  the system of a \u201Cblack-and-white-only\u201D-standard. Wether vehicle glyphs
  should get depicted either frontally or sideways has been \uFB01nally settled by
  the decision to encode both views in case of the principal transport vehicles \u2013
  for mere practical reasons.\r\n\r\nAnother issue has been, of course, the choice
  of reference glyphs for the standard\u2019s code charts. One should take their details
  not for more serious than they are. The Japanese inspiration has been mentioned
  already. The Manga-style ductus of many of the glyphs shown (e.g. in the smileys
  and figurative sections) bears witness to that \u2013 presumably forever. But, the
  whole bunch of characters in question were to be seen as one world-wide usage symbol
  set altogether, as it had to be discussed many times. May the celebrated Otl Aicher
  once have dreamed of radical culture-cleansing of the pictogram style, a style \u201Cabsolutely
  neutral\u201D and equally perceived by all men on earth \u2013 the visual outcome
  of the new UCS-6.0 codecharts is a striking proof of the impossibility of such a
  \u201Ctotalitarian\u201D neutralism.\r\nThe codecharts as they are now visualize
  the difficulty of building a global graphic language out of diverse local traditions.
  Or, to put it more simple, the visual diversity now manifest e.g. in the 1F300 codechart
  does highlight the magnitude of the design task when it comes to implementation
  of those glyphs into fonts.\r\n\r\nThe past decade saw much labouring on the harmonization
  of several scripts into one font. A target put on the agenda by the existence of
  Unicode. If some little prediction is allowed: the decade upon us will see an explosion
  of signage fonting and much competition among designers for the best harmonization
  of letters and pictographs. The use of public signage, steadily increasing for 20
  years now, will even more increase than ever, facilitated by Unicode. It will be
  exciting.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s actually all about a new world script. We have the privilege
  to witness its development and to contribute to the shaping of its evolution. An
  evolution still in its childhood, for a many Hundreds of signs and glyphs still
  to become established. The standard encoding, a new technical backing to their application,
  will have a notable impact on the visual culture of our environment. \r\nMaybe,
  \u201CUnicode\u201D was never living up so close to the very nature of its name
  than today.\r\n\r\n______\r\nMy new font <strong>Symbojet</strong> is still in the
  MyFonts pipeline, but will be available in a few days. [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=341|Here

  body: "Andreas, thanks for sharing these information. Nice to see a type designer
    finnaly using combining symbols. Except for MS Unicode fonts \u2013like Arial\u2013
    I did not see any font using this until now. The project I'm doing includes this
    fine resource \u2013and I also added some variations beyond Unicode\u2013 as I
    believe this is a very useful feature.\r\n\r\nHow did you build Symboljet regarding
    the usual A-Z, 0-? glyphs? The font ignores them?"
