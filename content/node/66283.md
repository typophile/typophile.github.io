    certainly is true that this looks as though Al Gore is ignorant about how non-ranging
    numerals are supposed to appear traditionally. Perhaps he never read the Readers'
    Digest, which used to use a typeface with them.\r\n\r\nBut I can think of one
    class of typeface which - consistently - used a ranging style 1 and yet the other
    digits went above and below the line following the pattern of non-ranging digits.\r\n\r\nTypewriter
    faces.\r\n\r\nAlthough the numerals in the typeface of a typical manual typewriter
    were cap-height and not x-height, like ranging numerals, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 descended
    <em>slightly</em> below the line, and 6 and 8 ascended <em>slightly</em> above
    the line. None the less, if a 1 was provided on the typewriter, it still had the
    conventional ranging appearance (and if it wasn't, lowercase l, not uppercase
    I, was used as a substitute conventionally).\r\n\r\nSo these two styles of numerals
    have been hybridized before."

    or simply that he cares more about functionality than tradition! Which is an entirely
    valid stance to take in my book. As quoted on the Typotheque blog: \u201CWell,
    in the book there\u2019re a lot of examples of scientific nomenclature and this
    particular numeral one is causing confusion when it\u2019s combined with capitals.\u201D"

    There are plenty of faces with non-ranging figures that don't feature an oldstyle
    I-like 1.\r\n\r\nAnd the trend goes back much further than typewriter faces, of
    course. The kind of three-quarter hybrid that quadibloc describes descend basically
    from Richard Austin and trace back to the late 18th century.\r\n\r\nCustomization
    of fonts for clients is also nothing new, of course. Everyone here knows that.
    Nonetheless, it's always amusing to see under-the-radar stuff like this achieve
    widespread media attention. Good PR for Typotheque and Nikola Djurek (I think
    Brioni is a wonderful design).\r\n\r\nHowever, I do think some of the reports
    exaggerate the effort required to refit an oldstyle 1. This particular customization
    is not <em>that</em> \u201Chard.\u201D"

    they notice. They just don\u2019t usually have the celebrity of Al Gore, and we
    don't usually trumpet the adjustments.\r\n\r\nIf the oldstyle 1 was such a problem
    in this book to begin with, then I\u2019m disappointed the designer and/or the
    editor didn\u2019t deal with it before the proofs got to Gore. "
