  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, <BR>I&#39;m looking for advice on type for an artist&#39;s book. The book will be mostly photographs, printed in warm quadratone, one to a page &#40;in some cases one to a spread&#41;. There will type on title pages, acknowledgements, and on a one or two page essay. The type is set simply, fairly large &#40;13pt&#41; and the essay is set with very large margins. Page size is 15 x 13 inches. <BR> <BR>The photographs are dense and lush, but of stark subject matter, and formally could be seen as late modern. The overall time feel of the images is &#34;some time in the 20th or 21st centuries.&#34;  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve expermimented with a couple of treatments, including sans serif &#40;which just seemed to plain in the context of the work&#41; and traditional serif faces like Garamond and Bembo, which seemed to &#34;retro&#34; and to overemphasize that aspect of the work. <BR> <BR>My current mockup uses Mrs. Eaves. I like the general look of it, but the letterspacing in the body copy is kind of wonky. Also, it seems kind of trendy right now ... I&#39;d prefer something with a similar feel but fresher. <BR> <BR>As a final note, I may end up having the text printed letterpress from plates made from digital files. Mrs. Eaves seems designed to give a &#34;letterpress look&#34; and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a good idea to print a face that mimics letterpress on an actual letterpress. However, I may end up printing conventionally, so ideally I&#39;ll use a type that would work with either approach. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts on what I might look at? <BR>Some samples of the photographs are at <a href="http://www.paulraphaelson.com" target="_blank">www.paulraphaelson.com</a> <BR> <BR>Thank you very much for any help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all the advice, everyone. <BR>I&#39;ve been experimenting a lot, and nothing looks as good as Mrs. eaves for the title page and cover type. But it&#39;s not working for the body copy, partly because of the low x-height and partly because of the messed up letterspacing.  <BR> <BR>Of everything I&#39;ve looked at for the text, the two faces that look best are baskerville &#40;which I guess eaves is based on&#41; and cochin. <BR> <BR>Do you think it&#39;s strange to use two different serif text faces like this? They won&#39;t be on the same page as each other ... the mrs. eaves will only be at the front of the book, since there won&#39;t be display copy used with the text. <BR> <BR>One thing I find I like for this project is a capital W without a center serif &#40;as in the baskerville and the eaves, but not the cochin&#41;. I know this sounds nitpicky, but it stands out for me since the title starts with W.</div>

But if you find a typeface that has many weights in a very tight range &#40;or if you manage to tweak the weight of the font yourself, or maybe outsource that task&#41; then you could just swap the two weights as needed.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Paul, <BR>Looking at your photographs I keep thinking of Franklin Gothic. It may be the foreigner&#39;s romantic view of early 20th Century New York but, to me, those desolate industrial spaces are calling for some of Benton&#39;s faces. <BR> <BR>I think a nicely spaced and carefully sized Franklin Gothic Heavy would work very well for titles and, specially, captions. And if you print photopolymer-letterpress it will help convey the strong human-scale dimension of that face. <BR> <BR>Raph Levien has on his site some <a href="http://levien.com/type/atf_1923/" target="_blank"> images</a> of the 1923 ATF specimen book, with nice samples of both Franklin and News Gothic. <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/12600/itcfranklingothicheavy-font.html?PHPSESSID=0b3163a10bba60888762e3d419511cb3" target="_blank">Link</a> to Linotype&#39;s ITC Franklin Gothic. <BR> <BR>I hope this helps, your work is really good and, regardless of your type choice, I&#39;m sure it will be a beautiful book.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62; <BR>Thank you, Jesus, for the kind words about my work. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m interested in earlier the remark that Mrs. Eaves&#39; spacing is fixed by Indesign. I thought this might be the case and printed a sample; indesign definitely flowed the paragraph better, but the letterspacing within the words was about the same. Is there a preference or something within the program that can adjust this? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also been looking at Veljovic. The color is a bit light, but otherwise I like the type very much.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m definitely sticking to serif fonts .. my experiments with sans serif just haven&#39;t worked out for this project. <BR>Still looking, but I&#39;m considering all the suggestions here and I greatly appreciate all the input. <BR>&#60;/font&#62;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of the suggestions above, my favorite is the Wilson. If the Mrs Eaves is working for you, the Wilson will probably work just as well or better. <BR> <BR>Especially if you&#39;re going to go through with the photopolymer, I might also suggest Centaur. The current digitization suffers from being a bit thin and spidery, but cranking up the press gain could fix that. I&#39;m working on optically scaled versions, but it&#39;s going to be quite some time before those are ready. <BR> <BR>The Sierra Club has used Centaur in their photo books to great effect.
