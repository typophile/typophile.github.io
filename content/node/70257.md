  and subhead (reading \"Competitions & Events\") of this page http://clamfestival.com/competition.php\r\n\r\nPages
  throughout the site have varying subheads that provide additional clues.\r\n\r\nI've
  had trouble finding a font with the same \"s,\" which is condensed, narrow, and
  has a very shallow curve.\r\n\r\nThank you for any leads!\r\n\r\nLisa"
