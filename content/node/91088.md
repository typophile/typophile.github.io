body: "Hello - new to the board and looking forward to delving into it when I have
  some time.\r\n\r\nNo excuses though - my first act is a request to identify the
  typeface(s) used in the attached image.\r\n\r\nA colleague of mine believes that
  the \"Lothbury\" part is a face that Marks and Spencer used to use (not Optimum
  - before even that), but I can only find one dodgy old photo of a label (with the
  old St Michael on it), which seems to bear this out. Still none the wiser.\r\n\r\nWe
  also believe that the 41 is a different font altogether.\r\n\r\nAny help or suggestions
  would be gratefully received.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nAndy"
