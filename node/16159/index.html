  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys!

Would you please be so kind and give me some feedback on a logo that I've recently created.
It's for a local DJ called "dynamike" He is mainly into Hip Hop and House Music, but he doesn't want his logo to look "ghetto" so no Graffiti or Tag  wordmark could be used here.

the logo itself says the DJ name (dynamike) and has got 4 splines (word?!) following it..
those splines symbolize the splines of a Vinyl but also an explosion (dynamiKe)

some c&c would be nice

		<div class="commentbody">To me it doesn't really develop the dynamic side of the name, the splines/grooves should expand from the same centre point and possibly enlarge, while the weight of the stroke increases as they explode, so you get a v-shaped wedge. I would also move the centre of the radii to the vertical centre of the x-height. The legs of the k and the a, e and i look a bit too rounded rather than using a similar terminal style that is used on the others, and as Jan said the m is too narrow. Have you tried a vertical style?

		<div class="commentbody">It's funny, my first reading of the name was as a play on 'dynamic'.

I agree about the 'm' feeling cramped. Also, the radiating curves are pretty dead. As Tim said, they don't feel explosive or dynamic. Even the grooves in a record change width and rhythm. A good DJ can read them and find bass lines and breaks, so that might be something to play with. Anything to enliven the rhythm.

Building on the shapes in the terminals, I suggest that you modify them to give the whole word a more directional feel, particularly since there are curves 'blasting' and 'radiating' outward from the right side. Some of the terminals are oriented inward in relation to each other, like on the 'n' and 'm'. Try customizing the characters to work in that specific word, rather than as an alphabet for any word.

You've got a good starting concept that you should punch up and really push in new visual directions.</div>

chris: having the letters all look in the same direction, definitely gives it a more dynamic feel.. 

I'm not too sure about the radiation curves / grooves though.. some help would be nice..

@tim.. I've also made a vertical wordmark.. looks ok.. doesn't remind me of a dynamite stick..

		<div class="commentbody">I'd recommend playing with the spacing of the grooves just a bit. Plus the curves seem at little shakey, in a not-intentional way (maybe it just appears that way at this small screen size, hard to tell?). If you could make them perfect circle-segments, then tweak the spacing a bit, you'd be almost there. Is the "m" still a little cramped? Spacing is a little off between a-m and m-i. The e might need a click to the left as well, but personally, I'd rather add a click between each letter except the t-e and m-i.
Looking good though.
Also, I'm thinking people may overlook your updated file/progress. You might post it up top with a new name to be more visible?</div>

Try constructing your radiating curves from sections of related concentric ovals or circles, something <a href="http://www.olegvolk.net/gallery/various/concentric">like this</a>. You'll find that they feel more inherently and organically cohesive. Your curves don't feel quite right for some reason.

		<div class="commentbody">hey guys.. the problem that i see with having all the curves in the same colour is that it takes away any uniqueness (word?) from them.. that's how I think about it..

hmm i quite like what you did there curtze.. maybe looks a bit to 70y disco stylish with all the dots.. and less hip hop/house stylish</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While the blank space does appear more dynamic it seems to me that the blank space isn't centred on the height of the curves, the bottom "halves" look smaller to me. It also acts a horizon which doesn't appear centred on the x-height, especially with the horizontal element of the bottom of the e, – it needs to move down a gnat's. Have you tried expanding the space as the curve expands from the original?

		<div class="commentbody">maybe this is too obvious, but have you considered using a lit fuse instead of the waves? The waves aren't terribly meaningful and are on every other logo these days it seems.</div>
