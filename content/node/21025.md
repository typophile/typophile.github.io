body: "Are there <em>any</em> restrictions in using typefaces bundled with software
  in commercial graphic design work?\r\n\r\nI'm mostly building websites, so I'm either
  using the typefaces in graphics or in Flash objects. The font files aren't distributed
  in any way, of course.\r\n\r\nHow about books and print design? If you're on Windows,
  can you use e.g. Arial (duh) in a print project without getting a commercial license?\r\n\r\nI've
  purchased all my fonts so far, but am just curious."

  body: Wouldn't there be a read-me or license file that accompanies bundled fonts?
    It probably addresses it.

  body: "This is a lot bigger issue than you may think.\r\n\r\nWeb designers in every
    part of the world are at this very point using fonts that they've gotten bundled
    or preinstalled. They don't read EULAs because they don't probably even notice
    the licensing issue. This happens mostly because many web designers aren't that
    design-aware at all, and just mind about the technical issues.\r\n\r\nI've seen
    Windows computers that have everything from Baskerville to Bodoni (E+F) preinstalled
    in them, and people use them freely without regret. Be it personal or commercial
    work.\r\n\r\nAnd how about all those small companies that use all possible Arials
    and Verdanas (duh) in their ads and signage? How would they care about some fonts
    that came with the machine?"

    any font specific usage rights or restrictions \u2013 the fonts are covered by
    the same restrictions as the main application or operating system \u2013 the standard
    stuff prohibiting redistribution, modification, reverse engineering etc., often
    the apps own functionality and settings in the fonts contradict the product\u2019s
    EULA (eg. font embedding and printer-download). \r\n\r\nAlso as its common sense
    that fonts are used to produce printed content this right has never really been
    identified. Interestingly Microsoft is changing this with font specific section
    in the Windows Vista EULA\u2026 \r\n\r\n<CITE>1 d. Font Components.  While the
    software is running, you may use its fonts (including software, metrics and data)
    to display and print content. You may only:\r\n\u2022 Embed fonts in content as
    permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and\r\n\u2022 Temporarily

  body: I think the use of bundled fonts does pose an interesting question. However,
    I think most people don't worry about it if the service bureau is running the
    same applications. If I create a IllustratorCS2 document and set some type in
    Chaparral Pro the service bureau will have the same bundled fonts if they have
    capability of dealing with AI CS2 files.

  body: I just checked some bundled fonts (URW and Miles) that came with a program
    I bought at clearance somewhere, and there is no mention of of anything to do
    with use or restrictions in the font folder or the main read-me file. Of course
    I have to admit, no professional would ever buy this CD for the main application.

    can use Adobe's bundled fonts the same ways you can use Adobe fonts licensed separately.
    The only difference is in the minimum license (1 user versus 5 user).\r\n\r\nGiven
    the huge number of various licenses out there, I'm sure there's *somebody* whose
    license says you can't use the bundled fonts in work you get paid for. But I don't
    recall ever seeing such a license, myself.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
