  target="_blank">http://www.studioangelus.com/images/mkfontsample.gif</a> <BR>...
  for a car magnet sign, and it needs to be done tomorrow. I can find a &#34;close
  enough&#34; font or pull an all-nighter &#40;well, a to-midnighter, which isn&#39;t
  good for my sleep habits&#41; faking it in Freehand, but my sense of proffessional
  pride begs me to try to get it right before resorting to workarounds. <BR> <BR>A
  very close font I found on our communal work computer is &#34;CG Omega&#34; but
  for the life of me I couldn&#39;t find the font file to transfer to my own work
  machine.  <BR> <BR>A coworker suggested Helvetica, but this has a touch of serif
  and &#40;unless I&#39;m mistaken&#41; Helvetica is a sans. <BR> <BR>Sorry this got
  so long, and thanks for any help.'

  body: Yes, that&#39;s it exactly. <BR>...and oy, it&#39;s a pay font. My boss might
    not go for that, nice font or not. Guess I&#39;ll be faking it. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    anyhow.

    <BR>Edit: Well, poo. I don&#39;t have a lookalike font in my system. If anyone
    can point me towards a free lookalike I will be absolutely delighted &#40;and
    remain employed&#41;.'

    -- you might see if you have that, by any chance.

    better than the vectored shapes I was trying to concoct! Thanks.

  body: Hey when I click on the link to your sample I get a prissy little message
    about bandwidth theft. I don&#39;t even know what that is &#40;most people appreciate
    any traffic to their site&#41;, but it ain&#39;t in Optima that&#39;s for sure.
    Whassup with this??

  body: 'Patricia-- sorry about that, my bandwitdh protection protocols must&#39;ve
    kicked in with so much traffic. I had it set to let a clicked-on URL work properly,
    but obviously it needs tweaking. <BR> <BR>I did that because I&#39;ve had problems
    with people hotlinking pictures from my site. That&#39;s when a site grabs pictures
    from other sites and eats up the others&#39; bandwidth, which is usually limited
    to so much traffic a month. If it goes over a certain amount, I have to pay a
    higher fee. I do appreciate traffic to my site, but I&#39;d rather they come to
    my page instead of seeing my artwork hotlinked without permission. <BR> <BR>The
    link originally led to a .gif that was a scan of what I was looking for. I apologise
    for the confusion and I&#39;ll edit the original post now that my problem&#39;s
    been solved. <BR> <BR>&#40;And I am sorry about it being &#34;prissy&#34; but
    it&#39;s certainly not directed at you. It&#39;s meant to be prissy to those who
    hotlink without permission.&#41; <BR> <BR>EDIT: Er, it seems I can&#39;t edit
    my original link. I again apologise to anyone who got my pagebreaking anti-hotlink
    message graphic. Perhaps an admin can edit the post for me and avoid any more
    faux-pas?'

  body: I&#39;m sorry if my note sounded prissy too - but I have actually backed my
    way into some very interesting &amp; well designed web sites through this forum.
    It&#39;s one of the reasons I come here. I have also gotten some nice comments
    on my own site from others here and don&#39;t much care how they got to it.

    a trip through your sites and I&#39;m very impressed. Your graphic work is clever
    and fresh and I just love the jellyfish and woodwork paintings.
