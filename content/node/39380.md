  a font that contains components that overlap, eg. Ccedilla \u2026 sometimes when
  zooming in and out briefly you can see that the overlap space between shapes flash's
  white, basically 'inverting' the overlap shape.\r\n\r\nIs this just an occurence
  with overlapping components in Illustrator? Is there a step in the process to merge
  a component and glyph before or during export?"

    just want to check your font temporarily, try exporting it as a True Type font
    to avoid this problem. \r\n\r\nI also wanted to know that why does sometimes it
    shows those white overlaps (specially in OTF outputs), even if the curves direction
    is correct? Anyone?"

  body: "Yeah I'm curious if it's best to decompose all components and merge contours\u2026
    I assume thats the step to avoid any strange overlaps, they've only shown up for
    myself when zooming or panning, just a detail I picked up on while working with
    a textfield that had component characters in it."

  body: Yes, it is best to merge contours if there are overlaps. Historically, some
    RIPs had a problem interpreting overlaps, and reversed-out the overlapped area.
    This may not be an issue any longer, but a more common problem is that users may
    want to apply outline effects to type, and if there is an overlap in e.g. Ccedilla
    then the overlap will be exposed.

  body: "John: \"Historically, some RIPs had a problem interpreting overlap...\"\r\nThis
    is true or contours that overlap within a glyph.  \r\nBut I thought composites
    are rendered as separate contours, and with the ensuing bitmaps merged, there
    should be no problem?\r\n\r\nMike: \"...sometimes when zooming in and out briefly
    you can see that the overlap space between shapes flash\u2019s white...\"\r\nI
    have seen zooming do that described here, almost like there is still some little
    gremlin of old PS code that is relied on at certain combinations of resolution
    and zoom. \r\n\r\nJohn: \"...users may want to apply outline effects to type,
    and if there is an overlap in e.g. Ccedilla then the overlap will be exposed.\"\r\n...in
    many applications. There are some apps, like InDesign for example, which not only
    respect the TT flag indicating overlaps (& removing them automatically when outline
    effects are specified), but go beyond and manage the final rendering of all outlined
    type intelligently, as illustrated below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IndesignOutlines_5832.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    \xC7 and \xF8 are overlapping composites in this example, and as the intelligent
    application must do the \"right thing\" to the \"ca\" tracking that goes on as
    the example continues... I mean, what do other apps do?\r\n\r\nCheers!"
