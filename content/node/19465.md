  is the third in a series that uses three panel strips made from doll photos I've
  taken. The eyes were empty holes, but I painted some in and used Kai's glass filter
  to make it look a little reflective.\r\n\r\nFont is Menuetto by Dieter Steffman\r\n\r\n(These
  are 600 pixels wide, so I wasn't sure what the limit is for viewing without having
  to scroll)"
