body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CodePeanut-one-sample_3793.png]\r\nI came
  up with this to make a random looking texture pattern of large and small circular
  blobs. The pattern of the characters is based on Morse code, the dahs represented
  by circles three times the diameter of the dits, all enlarged slightly to overlap
  and then the joints were smoothed. I have only rendered the basic alphabet A-Z,
  copied to a-z. Other characters (punctuation, numerals, accented characters) are
  currently filled with a temporary 90\xB0 rotated I glyph.\r\n\r\nThe image above
  is from dummy text generated by [[http://judebear.daveward.net/|MacLorem]]."

    wants to be the first to say anything. Is this an apt conclusion or a false dilemma?\r\n\r\nBut
    still, anybody with a Mac who is needing dummy text should go out and download
    MacLorem (linked in the first post). It's good stuff. I'm not affiliated with
    the author of that software in any way, just a fan of the product."

    to comment. :->\r\nIn any case, I could see this used for making cool looking
    textures/patterns with hidden meaning. Kinda like the the stuff on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Digital_My_Book\">MyBook</a>,
    but less \"technical\" looking, more bubbly and\u2026 Seventies? :-)"

  body: Thanks, that's exactly the sort of purpose it's meant for--placing semi-secret
    messages on machine grates and similar things. It probably would have to be laser
    cut for a similar application to what the MyBook case has. A stamping die that
    fine might be difficult to create and maintain with all these curves. Something
    injection molded like a car grille shouldn't be as hard.

  body: Fair enough. I guess the question is should I proceed and extend the font
    with proper Morse code numbers, punctuation, and diacriticals, or release it as-is?
    Would someone who uses something like this really be interested in communicating
    more than rudimentary messages with it?
