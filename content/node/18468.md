  Acme 9 Regular</strong></a> \r\n\r\nWhat i want from you is to just test it for
  feedback purposes... I'm mostly interested in knowing how it works in international
  operating systems (English, French, Italian, German, ect.) Win and Mac. Central
  European and Turkish characters are also included.\r\n\r\nThe characters that are
  included are here (4 Turkish characters [\u011E\u011F\u0130\u0131] are not present
  below):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/charTable2.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  have English and Greek languages installed in my system (Win XP pro) but i don't
  know how i can access the above letters that are wanted in \r\n\r\n<strong>Western
  European languages</strong>\r\n(<em>Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German,
  Iceland, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish</em>)\r\n\r\nand
  in <strong>Central European languages</strong>\r\n(<em>Albanian, Croatian, Czech,
  Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Latin, Slovak, Slovenian</em>)\r\n\r\nAre
  the characters of your (above) language available at your system? \r\n\r\nIf you
  find that something isn't working please post here the versions of you OS and software
  that you're typing. You can also email me your feedback at the email that can be
  found in the txt.\r\n\r\nIt is a pixel font and use it at size 8px with \"none\"
  anti-alias. You can use it for free at your own risk!\r\n\r\nThanx in advance."

  body: "I'm new to pixel fonts, too. I tried out a paragraph in a few different sizes.
    I also tried all caps. I find that in MS Word (quickest way for me to test a full
    paragraph), on a 72-dpi screen, LCD laptop, it actually looks best at 6 point.
    All caps looks just about as readable as standard \"sentence case.\" There are
    a couple spacing issues that bug me:\r\n\r\n1- LC \"a\" often needs more space
    on left, but not always. check various pairs\r\n\r\n2- LC \"i\" often rides too
    close to others on the right\r\n\r\n3- \"z\" isn't right as a mirror of \"s\"
    -- it looks like numeral \"2\"\r\n\r\n4- the most conspicuous irritation is that
    the standard intra-word space is too small. I replaced all lone spaces with two
    spaces, and it instantly became FAR more readable.\r\n\r\notherwise, i like it.

    body: "Thanx jlg4104 for your instant feedback...\r\n\r\n|<em> ...I tried out
      a paragraph in a few different sizes...</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nOk i guess i have to
      paste some guidelines on using this pixel font in order to work ok. It is designed
      to work with software like Macromedia Flash and Adobe Photoshop:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n############
      Macromedia Flash 8 ############ \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FL8.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>1)</strong>
      Use the font only at 8px or multiples of 8 (16,24,etc) with \"anti alias for
      animation\" selected.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<strong>2)</strong>
      Position your text blocks where _x and _y values are whole numbers, \r\n\r\ni.e.
      position them at the point _x=250 and _y=150, NOT at _x=250.8 and _y=150.4.\r\n\r\nIf
      you don't place your text's _x and _y position on a whole number, the pixel
      font will look blurred.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<strong>3)</strong>
      When you place your text inside a movie clip,  the clip must also be positioned
      on whole pixel _x and _y values. \r\nDo not scale the movieclip. Make sure it
      is at 100% size (Modify / Transform / Remove Transform)\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<strong>4)</strong>
      Align your text only left, NOT right, center or justified.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<strong>5)</strong>
      Try to avoid animating (tween animation) pixel fonts. When your fonts move,
      they get blurry \r\nbecause they are not located on a whole pixel value. On
      the other hand you can try and animate them \r\nvia actionscript using the Math.round();
      function in order to animate the text clip in whole pixel values.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<strong>6)</strong>
      Avoid scaling pixel fonts using Flash's Scale feature. If you need to increase
      the size of your pixel font, \r\nincrement the text's font size by 8 (16,24,etc).\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<strong>7)</strong>
      Make sure that you view your stage / movie / swf file at 100% view size. (View
      / Magnification / 100% - Ctrl+1)\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<strong>8)</strong>
      To enable the kerning pairs that are included with the font (Ta, Te, Tn, To,
      Tr, Ts, Tu, Tv, Tw, Ty, Tz, gj, yj, \u0393\u03AC, \u0393\u03AD, \u0393\u03AE,
      \u0393\u03B1, \u0393\u03B5, \u0393\u03B7, \u0393\u03B9, \u0393\u03BF, ect ),
      with \"Static\" texts turn on the \"Auto Kern\" feature while \"anti alias for
      animation\" is selected. In \"Dynamic\" and \"Input\" texts with \"Auto Kern\"
      feature on, you must also \r\nEmbed the letters that are included in the pairs.
      \r\nIf you turn off \"Auto Kern\", the font will still work fine but without
      the Kerning Pairs available.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n############
      \ Adobe Photoshop CS / CS2  ############ \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PSCS2.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>1)</strong>
      Use the font only at 8px or multiples of 8 (16,24,etc) with the Anti-aliasing
      set to \"None\", the \"Kerning\" feature set to \"Metrics\", \r\nHorizontal
      and Vertical Scale set to 100%, the tracking set to 0 and the text field must
      be \"Point Text\" (click and type - DON'T click, drag and then type).\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<strong>2)</strong>
      The resolution of you picture must be at 72 dpi.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<strong>3)</strong>
      Always align your text Left. Sometimes it also works when aligned Center and
      Right, but use it at your own responsibility.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<strong>4)</strong>
      To enable the kerning pairs that are included with the font, set the \"Kerning\"
      feature to \"Metrics\". To disable Kerning Pairs, set the \"Kerning\" feature
      to \"0\".\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nHope
      i helped..."

  body: P.S. Access to those other glyphs depends on the program. MS Word needs "insert
    special character", although you can set up custom keystrokes for anything that
    doesn't already have a keystroke. In InDesign, you can grab stuff from the glyph
    palette. For online work, there are many HTML entity tables out there.

  body: Ah, ok. That was my own ignorance-- I was just responding as if it were a
    standard typeface meant to be used at tiny sizes. I'll give the above a try--
    it'll be a learning experience for me.
