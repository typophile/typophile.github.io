body: I see many graphic designer talk about [[http://tiff.herokuapp.com/|this new
  tool]] which lets you compare two fonts and I'd like to see what professional type
  designers and typophiles think about it. Is there a need for an app like this?

    hard to compare. I prefer to just lay them over each other like that in Illustrator,
    but I could see the need for comparing with fonts that I don\u2019t own."

    want to compare fonts, I want to do it in a lot more detail than is available
    here (or over a  broader range of glyphs and in context so as to see metrics,
    colour & etc. \r\n"
