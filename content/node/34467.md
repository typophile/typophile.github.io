  There\u2019s been no new work at this firm for a month (for almost all the staff,
  not just me), and given how low the pay is, I would be better off just doing temp
  work or freelancing. The only reason I have not left already is that the firm has
  a semi-prestigious reputation and might look good on a resume.\r\n\r\nI am, however,
  concerned about what future employers will think about my record with internship
  work. I can\u2019t get a good reference from my last internship because I quit when
  they really started taking advantage of me and it was not an amicable split. I also
  got no portfolio stuff from that job, because only two pieces I worked on were printed
  and they both looked like crap due to arguments between the marketing executives
  and the business executives over how things should look. If I quit this job I will
  probably have no good reference and again have nothing to show for it in my portfolio.
  \r\n\r\nAs employers, how harshly would you judge a new designer who had done two
  internships, neither of which worked out?"

  body: "Well for starters you don't tell future employers that it didn't work out.\r\n\r\nI
    quit my first internship too with no ill effects on my future career. You'll still
    have the internships on your resume. If you're that miserable and bored, then
    quit and really focus on trying to find portfolio pieces. I don't think anybody
    expects you to come out of an internship with portfolio pieces anyway. The references...
    if your teachers give you good refs and you can get one perhaps from someone you
    temp with or freelance for, you should be fine.\r\n\r\nBut... and this is a big
    but... consider what your expectations are and have been from these internships.
    This could be important going forward. Nothing annoys an employer more than a
    fresh-faced design school graduate who expects to waltz in and be handed plum
    work. You have to start at the bottom, work hard, do the work you're given to
    do with enthusiasm and initiative, and hope that someone recognizes your individuality
    and discipline and gives you more interesting projects to do. It doesn't happen
    overnight and you have to make sure your attitude is commensurate with your position.\r\n\r\nMy
    first job was operating a photostat camera for $7/hour. I worked all day alone
    in the dark with smelly chemicals, and the only perk was that the designers would
    come into my \"office\" after 6 and cut lines on the stat camera glass. They shared
    it with me since it was, after all, my office (it was a darkroom - you had to
    knock before entering - which helped them conceal their activity). After a few
    months the art director took me under his wing and started letting me help him
    and he liked me, I got to skip the mechanical stage and start laying out books
    within a year. I think it was a combo of luck (he took an interest in me) and
    perhaps talent/enthusiasm (he saw something he liked)."

    wrote about past employers in public forums?\r\n\r\nWhat are you using to gauge
    the success of an internship? If you're getting good real-world experience then
    it's a success. If you get hired that's just a bonus. Many interns come and go
    without getting hired and it's not seen as a \"failure\". It is true that the
    stellar interns do get hired. "

    of your attitude.\r\n\r\nFor example, you say they were taking advantage of you
    in the first internship. But what reasonable steps did you take to resolve the
    situation before quitting? I would guess if one tried to resolve the situation
    professionally, one could at least achieve an amicable split if it came to that.\r\n\r\nFor
    another example, you say the firm you are at has had no new work. The firm's designers
    - including you - should be turning their attention toward winning new business
    - via good design. Congratulations, now you are learning about strategy, marketing,
    copywriting, networking... Welcome to the the real world of a designer.\r\n\r\njarrod\r\n"
