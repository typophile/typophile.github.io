  that the type is hand drawn, and the word is uncommon, I'm worried about the viewer's
  ability to pick up the name. How well does it read, and what do you read? Any feedback
  would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJim\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TK-Wordmark-Test_3434.jpg]"

  body: I agree, this reads fine now. I would lighten up that first O a bit, though.
    My eye keeps getting pulled in that direction because it seems so much heavier
    in comparison.

  body: far better to read than the first time, no doubt. I agree that the first O
    and second K could be lightened up a bit though, to improve eye movement. Otherwise
    one helluva good logotype!
