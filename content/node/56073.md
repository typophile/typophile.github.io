body: "This is an addition to Coru\xF1a that was a bit tricky and so I'm hoping someone
  might have some suggestions.\r\n\r\nI've added the Tifinagh alphabet to Coru\xF1a.
  \ It's shapes are deceptively simple, and being an unicase alphabet, making it match
  the color of the rest of Coru\xF1a wasn't easy.  This is a quick draft, I don't
  like the terminals at all, but just the same I'm not sure what will work.\r\n\r\nSince
  it's often seen in mixed script cases due to the commonness of Arabic and French
  in Morocco, I want to make sure it looks good on its on and mixed with Latin (I've
  only just begun Arabic so nothing to show yet)."

  body: "It's really interesting. It doesn't at first seem to harmonize with Coru\xF1a,
    but since I'm totally unfamiliar with Tifinagh script I have no idea what the
    rules are regarding its design. That could just be from having to look at them
    separately, though. If you could set some lines in both scripts together, as one
    might see in Morocco as you describe, that might make it easier to comment on."

    5 headings in an entire book that I think might help it harmonize better.  I'm
    gonna leave this one as is for the time being and go to work on the Arabic (just
    posted)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos
