  \r\n\r\nQ: If you have a Master Sheet and you update it can you get the text boxes
  to automatically snap to the new guides? If it is possible can you describe how
  to do it or point to where it says? I have been hunting around but to no avail.
  Maybe because I am a InDesign Newbie. Or it may be that what I want InDesign to
  do it doesn't do. If it can't that would be good to know too. Thanks in advance! "

    that\u2019s what it\u2019s called in ID CS2).\r\nThe InDesign Help is pretty expedient
    on this.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the basics of this function are explained in \u2018InDesignSecrets
    Podcast Podcast 053\u2019 (<a href=\"http://indesignsecrets.com/podcast-053-transcript/\">Transcript</a>
    \u2013 quite to the end of the episode).\r\nF\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Have you tested that, Chris? I\u2019m pretty sure that this isn\u2019t 100%
    true. IIRC, you can make use of Layout Adjustment even if you didn\u2019t check
    \u2018Master textbox\u2019 when creating the document. You need a Master Sheet
    with guides \u2013\_or margins, of course."

  body: "If you have master text frames on your Master page and adjust them, the corresponding
    frames on the document pages will change accordingly, as long as you have not
    manually adjusted the text frame on a document page, thereby breaking the Master's
    control over it.\r\n\r\nIf you're talking about individual text frames on document
    pages (not created via or governed by any master text frames), then Florian's
    tip about Layout Adjustment is the way to go. Read up on it in the Help: it's
    not a magic bullet. But it is intended to do the sort of thing that I think you're
    asking about, as long as your initial conditions are right.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
