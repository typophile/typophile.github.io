body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ron Paul Poster_3493.png]\r\nI called my
  dad today to talk to him about how monetary policy is the biggest problem we currently
  face as a country. We talked for a while. Then I decided it was time to get along
  with this pet project I'd been working on; making a Ron Paul wordmark. Any suggestions
  for the type below it?"
