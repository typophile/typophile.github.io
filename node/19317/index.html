<dt>Printing quality is very nice, but for my eyesight, many samples were so small I had to strain to see them. Things like this tend to make me feel old, and I don&rsquo;t need that!</dt>
<dd>)
Maybe they should have a box you could check if you are over 50, and then send those people a larger version.</dd>

<p>But I will hook up my magnifier lamp thingy and take a better look, maybe this weekend.</p>

<p>Oh well, I did think of one advantage to it. I could take it wherever I go and barely notice it in my pocket.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve finished giving you a hard time, I will tell you I have a friend (we do music together regularly) that is part owner of an advertising company that has 20+ people in the graphics/design section, and I am going to try to make sure they get a look at your new fonts. I have to think that Zaner set would be fun for them to bill to one of their big customers (an eye-opening list, I found out yesterday).</p>

<p>I suspect that this is very true. P22&rsquo;s founder lived a previous life as a book artist. And the 10-years of P22 book is the most boundary-pushing type catalog since that po-mo wave (finally) ended. Yet in comparison to that stuff, the P22 book feels genuine and crafted. Much like their typefaces. If you don&rsquo;t like the catalog that they gave you for free, I suggest that you check out the real McCoy, which I believe is only $19.99 or so, and is worth every penny!</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware they had a better version. But I have just spent about ten minutes clicking and searching around their site and can&rsquo;t find mention of this offer. I saw the .pdf page, and also a reference to Catalog #8 on the page with &ldquo;The Works&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I know I am going to buy the Zaner Pro set. Do they (like Storm) send the catalog with an order?</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;better version, but rather an other product; a book celebrating their anniversary. It isn&rsquo;t a type specimen book or catalog, at least not in the traditional sense. It is more something to look at and read if you like P22&rsquo;s work, not if you want to see how all their fonts look and which one you should spec for your next project.</p>

<p>That explains that, and I am willing to admit I stand corrected.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just finish by saying another inch in each direction would probably sell more fonts. Especially those display fonts that are getting short shrift. I&rsquo;m really only trying to help.</p>

<p>i don&rsquo;t personally like it when people refer to designers as <em>graphics people</em> (or <em>graphics design</em>, or <em>graphics/design</em>)…it rubs me the wrong way because the only people who i&rsquo;ve heard use it, usually don&rsquo;t know much about this amazingly powerful and influential field.</p>
<p>the plural &ldquo;graphics&rdquo; sort of commoditizes what we do as if we are the makers of some sort of widget or something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;ll get this to my graphics guy, and he&rsquo;ll whip something up in no time (and not much cost)&rdquo;</p>
<p>although i wish there were another term,<em> graphic design</em> (singular) is preferable in this case because it has more to do with visual communication than with simply producing &ldquo;graphics&rdquo;. graphic design is a profound practice that affects everyone&rsquo;s lives, and it just bugs me that we don&rsquo;t get the respect and prestige we deserve…</p>
<p>it probably isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal to you, but i live and breath this stuff…</p>

<p>No, you all are getting to do what I wish I could have done if I had been able to show some artistic ability back before there was computers. I always got an A in art, but I recognized that I had no skill of the kind I admired.</p>
<p>I have nothing but respect for good graphic designers. Every once in a while I am put in my place when I see some magical output from a Photoshop genius or illustrator.</p>
<dl>
<dt>On the other hand I see things that indicate that some people are making it completely without any talent. Go figure. Makes me think of the line from &ldquo;On the Waterfront&rdquo; where Brando says &ldquo;I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let&rsquo;s face it.&rdquo;</dt>

<p>That&rsquo;s the thing though, pretty “graphics” has no meaning or significance in the field of visual <cite>communication</cite> if it doesn&rsquo;t <cite>communicate</cite> a message well. For instance, some Photoshop or Illustrator genius could whim up an amazing image or a sublime vector illustration and still be completely pointless in this regard (there is a lot of this garbage out there at the moment unfortunately, I just call them art). Graphic design is about effectively communicating a message visually, not about creating beautiful graphics. This is what I think Nick was trying to say.</p>

<p>I see what you mean. But I have done enough things to realize that an arresting image goes a long way to making a great design for some types of things. Some people, including photographers, just have a way with that. The designer gets the fun job of picking the right image, the right font, and putting it all together. Come on, it is kind of fun, isn&rsquo;t it? Especially when you can bill it to a customer.</p>

<p>sure. when i&rsquo;m working on a project i am excited about, i have a lot of fun doing what i love to do. i guess it&rsquo;s hard to explain this to someone who is outside the field (directly), but it can be really tough to satisfy the needs of your clients, and even more difficult is to really nail something, which usually combines the perfect solution to the given problem with some kind of innovation that is the first of it&rsquo;s kind.</p>
<p>(deep breath)</p>
<p>the very vague term <em>graphic design</em> is multi faceted and a <em>graphic designer</em> must be proficient in all the various principles of design, the variety of printing and manufacturing techniques required to mass-produce different materials, the software used, and all the technical difficulties that have to do with, proofing, color matching, pre-press, project management/workflow, archiving, and to top it off, all the larger issues like business practices, consulting, positioning, and of course strategy.</p>

<p>And I need to remind you that good graphic designers work their magic largely in Quark and Indesign. Photoshop is for images and effects, not really for design. Illustrator is unparallelled for logo work, and environmental graphics, and many other uses, but again, not the software of choice for print design.</p>

Some so called designers fail at thought process and achieve good technique; for some others, the reverse is true.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hear hear. I for one am glad to have cut my teeth before the computer revolution. Because type was so much more expensive back then and mistakes/changes so costly, you were required to think much more conceptually from the outset, rather than just sitting down and messing around until you have something you like - or throwing more and more fonts at it until you have a huge mess on your hands. I had a genius boss/mentor who still does very elaborate sketches on paper before sitting down at the computer. I still use his ideas in my work.</p>
<p>My favorite quote of his: if you do something only once it&rsquo;s a mistake; twice it&rsquo;s a design element. Saved my ass a few times.</p>
<p>All that said, you couldn&rsquo;t pay me to go back to the days of hand letterspacing, rubylith, and scotch rules.</p>

<p>dang… i didn&rsquo;t mean to <em>squelch</em> anyones dreams. design is an intuitive process and is quite interesting because the skills that i have mentioned above are only the prerequisite to setting everything up, and putting things in motion.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s almost like you start off developing the raw talent and abilities of your right brain, then you sharpen your logical left brain skills to learn how to make those ideas work on a practical level. finally, when you reach a certain point, you somehow learn how to use both sides of your brain simultainiously, which is an amazing thing when you see some of the stuff that&rsquo;s out there.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d say i&rsquo;m at the point where i&rsquo;m beginning to sharpen those logical/practical skills, but my right brain gets plenty of fulfillment along the way.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t feel too bad. It was really a heady mixture of day-dreams, illusions, and wishes.</p>
<p>I just get a rush when I do a decent job of matching one of my free fonts, with my free images, and some text I can find anywhere I can, and have it be pleasing to my eye, that the ultimate for me would be to be able to do it with highest quality fonts, killer images like I see in the image catalogs people keep sending me, and get paid for it.
And while we&rsquo;re at it, I&rsquo;d like to win the lottery without buying a ticket.</p>
