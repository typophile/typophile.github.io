  like to learn about DTP rules for hebrew so as the result looks pleasant and correct
  to native.\r\n\r\nGoogle doesn't provide the answer, or my question is wrong :)\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nAlexander"

  body: "I think the rules are in many ways similar to that of setting Latin text,
    though without the options of emphasis we have, and in reverse. Also note that
    Hebrew has a different system of harmony than Latin. If Hebrew is on the same
    line as Latin, the two languages should be sized so that the Hebrew mem-height
    is somewhere inbetween the Latin x- and cap-heights. Hebrew line-heights are going
    to be different than Latin, so try to make it balanced and have enough space between
    the lines and be careful with the measure.\r\n\r\nYour best bet might be to look
    at Hebrew books and see how they are set. Might help:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/hebrew-book-an-historical-survey/\">The

    the book on Worldcat when searching for 'Hebrew Typography'\u2014the name of the
    work sounds nice... I do own a copy of #1 and quite enjoy looking at it."
