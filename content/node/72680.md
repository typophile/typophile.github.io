body: "hello everyone- first time user\r\n\r\ni have what i believe will be a fairly
  easy ID- Im posting it b/c I simply have no experience and your site sounded very
  inviting.\r\nthe font(s) im trying to ID is that of both the 1992 16th Edition &
  the 2003 17th ed of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. the best links i could find
  were the 'look inside' links on amazon and barnes & noble. im just looking for the
  ID on the text of the actual quotes, not any of the other sections of the book.
  \r\n\r\n16th Ed.\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Bartletts-Familiar-Quotations-Collection-Literature/dp/0316082775\r\n\r\n17th

  you, \r\nChris D."
