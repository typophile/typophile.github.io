  Different on-line dictionaries seem to give different results:\r\n\r\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/saint\r\n\r\nhttp://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=69492&dict=CALD\r\n\r\nIsn't
  \"St\" for \"Saint\" and \"St.\" for \"Street\"?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\nAleksander"

    of the original word don''t receive a stop (eg Saint > St or  Doctor > Dr); ones
    that don''t, do (eg Street >St. or  etcetera > etc.).'

    Here in the States, we tend to always use periods. (If it's an abbreviation, it's
    an abbreviation; and therefore it gets a period, regardless of the letters.)\r\n\r\nHowever,
    there is an inconsistency in Bert's example: 'Saint' and 'Street' both end in
    the letter 't'. So you can use that UK rule to argue that both should be abbreviated
    without a stop.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n"

    about that, I had the dutch situation in mind, where 'straat' is street and it's

      Hart's Rules \xA76.1.6 says \"In English 'saint' is abbreviated as <em>St</em>
      (<em>St.</em> for 'street' is conventionally distinguished by having a full

      \r\n\r\nEvidence is stacking up for the \"dot in America, not in Britain\" concept.
      Working in UK academic journals publishing, I usually advocate the \"dot if
      the abbreviation doesn't end with the full word's last letter\" style mentioned
      above (and work on the assumption that the \"t\" in the abbreviation of \"Street\"
      is the first one and not the last one!)\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nEver

    say, \"well, then, saint should be S.t, to be consistent, showing that there are

    that it's an abbreviation, and since it has no final period, the missing letters
    must be in-between.\r\n\r\nBesides, can't all you typographers see the difference
