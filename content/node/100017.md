  thinking of making a book on type, but I\xB4m not sure to what extent I can include
  images and/or type specimens of contemporary type (living designers). Do I have
  to ask every designer for permission first?\r\nDoes anyone knows about the copyright
  in this concern? Thank you..!\r\n"

    have a problem. Typefaces can, however, receive a design patent but protection
    under that would only come into play if you were making fonts and making them
    available to the public.\r\n\r\nYou might, if you so wish and have the time to
    do so, notify the designer that you are including it in the book but it is highly
    unlikely you need to.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I am not a lawyer."

  body: "A rendering of a font is not the font. There can't remotely be any copyright
    issues.\r\n\r\nNow, some EULAs do place usage restrictions - but that's rare.
    And unless your publication is something like \"The Crappiest Fonts of the Past
    Decade\" they're gonna to play along real nice like.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, practically
    speaking the way this sort of thing often works is that you get the sample setting
    from the foundry. So: no need to actually have the fonts (gets very expensive
    very fast); implicit permission; and less work for you.\r\n\r\nI think a good
    person to ask for more advice is our very own Stephen Coles.\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/ahykbb5\r\n\r\nBTW,
    what's going to make your book special?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    at this stage, but if it\xB4ll be reality, it\xB4ll be no me-too, dumb showcase
    book I can assure you! "
