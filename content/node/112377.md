  the book \"LICHTENSTEIN POSTERS\".\r\n\r\nIt's a sans serif, maybe bold, caps, slightly
  rounded. The A, the R and the G are very typicals.\r\nI've found a font named \"Hector
  rounded bold\" wich is realy similar but a little bit too rounded.\r\n\r\nCould
  you help me ?\r\nThank's a lot."

  body: "\"The A, the R and the G are very typicals.\"\r\nIt would have been helpful
    if you had included an image. My idea of a typical R-- straight leg -- & G might
    differ from yours.\r\nI found an R from the book title, vertical leg with a kick
    at the base of the leg.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LichtensteinTypophile112377_5196.jpg]\r\nAnd
    possibly a G, seems to be part of the same font but I can't be certain.\r\nAnyway
    size is small and details are obscure.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LichtensteinTypophile112377B_5845.jpg]\r\nIf
    the labels inside the book are the same as the title, i.e. with an R with a kick
    at the base of the leg, then I think it would be something something other than
    Garage Gothic.\r\nAlso, it would be helpful if we could see a larger scale image
    of G and if Q appears in the book, that as well.\r\nDon"
