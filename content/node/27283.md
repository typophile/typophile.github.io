body: "Is there a type width between Regular and Condensed?\r\n\r\nIf there would
  be such a width, would it be too much of a splitting hairs sort of thing for users
  to understand?\r\n\r\nI've got a typeface in the works whose regular width is just
  too extended for my tastes. But for certain reasons, it has to be labeled the \"regular\"
  width. I have condensed weights too, which aren't really all that condensed, but
  are narrower than the regular.\r\n\r\nShort of renaming my axis points (which isn't
  a possibility here), is there a proper name for a width that would lie between these
  two points?"

  body: "<em>Si: compressed, squished or narrow?</em>\r\n\r\nA lot of bigger font
    families already use compressed and narrow variants, which are all less wide than
    the condensed, if I remember correctly. So calling the intermediary weight one
    of these would only add to the increasingly confusing landscape of font naming.\r\n\r\n<em>Thomas:
    In several families, Adobe has called it \u201Csemicondensed.\u201D</em>\r\n\r\nThank
    you! I should have remembered that some Adobe fonts had this. I'm glad that there
    is a specific naming precendent."

    to see that it employs the same scheme as for weights, with 'ultra', 'extra',
    'semi'."
