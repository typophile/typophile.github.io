  of the posts on the first page before I actually get through to post something (and
  honestly a little intimidated).  So I guess that means I am new, or somewhat new....anyhow,
  I have a question and I couldn't find anything through the search.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  using an iPhone app to follow this forum?  I am only at a desk for very small amounts
  of time during the day and would love to keep up with the forum without having to
  go through Safari and enlarging it every time.\r\n\r\nI know that there are a few
  apps that support a few types of forums, but the ones that I have tried don't work
  here (Forums, Tapatalk, TouchBB).  \r\n\r\nIf there isn't an app that is already
  in use, would it be possible to install the support apps from one of the mentioned
  apps on to the server? This would allow Forum reading apps to interface with the
  site, and I am guessing that would make quite a few people happy, well.....at least
  one.\r\n\r\nI asked Tiffany this question earlier, so if this has come up recently
  and I haven't seen it, sorry.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nRobb"

  body: "I can follow with rss, but can I reply? If I could, I guess that would be
    an answer, but honestly it's not as robust as a dedicated app.  The current apps
    just have to be pointed at the URL and they download the content and provide a
    complete interface, which includes following threads you are active in.\r\n\r\nFrom
    what I have read so far, the server side apps are free and painless (easy) to
    set up. One publisher said all the owner has to do is run the installation file
    and that was it.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I like the flash homepage. I just want an
    easier way to play : ) "

  body: "Yeah.....I remember I was working on a website with Illustrator 8 or 9, a
    LONG time ago. I bought it because I believed the packaging, I didn't even know
    what a vector was and got WAY in over my head.  Photoshop would have been a much
    wiser investment at that point, and I ended up just using MS Paint.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER,
    I've done more homework and other forums about the Tapatalk app actually mention
    the fact that its not difficult for a forum owner to install the plug-in. I think
    it would be really wise for this forum to offer that service, especially if its
    free.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tapatalk.com/\r\n\r\nCan we?  Please??????"

  body: "Fortunately, the login area on the main page is not done in Flash, so it's
    accessible from the iPhone.  Once you log in, click \"My Account\", and there
    will be the navigation links at the top of the page.  For example, if you click
    on \"Forums\" at the top, you can eventually get to the point where you can read
    and reply.\r\n\r\nBut yes, ideally, Typophile would serve a site that didn't use
    Flash, at least for iPhones and mobile devices without Flash."
