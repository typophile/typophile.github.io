Have you tried an <strong>e</strong> with the cross-stroke curving on the right where it joins the round stroke? Everything else is so smooth and rounded, that one corner stands out because it's the only pointy thing. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">This looks nice! Though I agree about the "va" join and the pointiness of the nose of the "e". Re the latter, maybe also try just adding a curve on the outer contour to soften the corner itself?
Also, in the "t", the lack of curves on the terminal of the tail seems odd. Not sure about the crossbar. All in all the "t" seems surprisingly "angular" to me.

BTW: Might the crossbar of the "e" be a bit heavier than the curve (especially the top curve)? Not sure which way is best to fix it though. Maybe compare the "e" to the "o" again, the "o" seems heavier?</div>

Just an idea:could you have the 't''s tail lead into the 'e''s crossbar similar to the v-a connection?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">the problem with the e is on the right side of the top bowl. it's too pointy at the corner and too flat at the 1-2 o-clock part of the curve. 

the curved terminals are cute. they would work better if they were consistent in their direction and application. try writing the name on paper a few times with a brush or a marker or something then pay attention how the terminals look. if you don't do anything else, at least add your curvey things to the crossbar and tail of the t.

if you want to have this thing spaced so tightly, consider getting rid of the left side of the t's crossbar. 

lastly, that's a bad place for the registered mark. you want it out of the way, somewhere I'm not going to notice it. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">First of all thank you everyone for your immense help. I've taken all your comments to heart and tried pretty much everything you mentioned. 


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-4_4907.png]

Specifically
<b>e</b>: I agree they seemed pointy at the 1-2o-clock part of the curve. I adjusted drastically to see the differences, and came up with a minor change that i think works.

<b>n</b>: I wasn't too sure about the 3 curved terminals, but they have grown on me.

<b>o<b/>: Thinned it out a little to help with the balance of the "e" however i may thin it out a little more.

<b>va</b>: Completely agreed with the "boxy" shape and completed the curves. Still not sure if the weights are perfect yet.

<b>t</b>: The t, frankly has been the hardest i wanted something more custom with a little flair to it so this is what i came up with - everyone inhouse likes the added well... whatcha think?

<b>©</b>: I completely agree, still not sure where to put it. Kinda like its place ment here.


Rip it apart one last time folks, i really appreciate the help!

		<div class="commentbody">There's something bothering my a bit about the left stroke of the V. 
It's hard to say exactly, it could be the bottom terminal that does it,
but somehow this stroke feels more stagnant and blocky to me than the rest
of the letters.

I tried reversing the top terminal of that V. Maybe (?) this helps.
