		<div class="commentbody">I never used to care for Helvetica, but I didn't dislike it particularly either. It just wasn't an aesthetic I had any interest in. I always thought, and still think, that the use of Helvetica for text in wide columns on glossy-paged books of the early '70s was hideous and unreadable, but as a heading and display face it seemed to work okay.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then I had the great pleasure of being commissioned to design a new Cyrillic, Greek and Hebrew for Helvetica, which obliged me to spend a lot more time looking at the design than I had previously. I'm still not inclined to make much use of Helvetica, but I have a lot more respect for it than I used to. One of the things I really came to appreciate was the sheer quirkiness and unpredictability of what most people think of as a very rationalised and geometric design. It's actually pleasantly perverse.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note that I'm talking here about the original Helvetica. Helvetica Neue is a completely different design: superior in almost every way, but much less quirky.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Helvetica is mostly a victim of its success. Designers get tired of seeing the same typefaces over and over. I can't think of any typefaces that have become as popular as Helvetica that have not had the same over-exposure problem with designers. I used to like Times Roman a lot more before it became a default font.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a young proto-designer in high school in the '70s, I was infatuated with Helvetica. My first sheet of Letraset was a sheet of 72-point Helvetica Medium, and I remember marveling over the subtle curves or the lowercase <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a, e,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->s.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> My design teacher in college said &quot;when in doubt, use Helvetica.&quot; I, like many others I think, imagined it as some kind of ultimate standard that all others were to be judged by; that it was a typeface with all the pretensions of style and ornamentation peeled away.   <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I grew out of my infatuation (or got bored with it) within a couple of years as I became more acquainted with the charms of other typefaces. But I can still remember a time when I imagined that in a perfect world everything would be set in Helvetica. (Ha! Heaven help us.) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I mostly think it's boring now, though I find that the way it has come back into fashion is interesting, were it's brought to center stage again. I couldn't use it like that without feeling ironic. Helvetica used to represent end of style. Now it's just another style.</div>

Overused to death and mundande and &ndash; thanks to Monotypes Arial bastardization of Akzidenz and Helv &ndash; everyday in fron of half the population of the world, I think there is not a single typeface in the world that is more bland. And I really have started to love that quality. Sometymes you just don't WANT a typeface with personality. Sometimes a grey suit is just the right thing and you don't need the lavender-striped piece.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I remember that I hated Helv for most of the 80s and early 90s. But most of the so-called replacements like, say, already look old-fashioned, as their aesthetic is so much coined by the times they were created in, while the Helvetica still looks fresh, maybe because it looks so 60s bland and neutral.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think its a bad choice for corporate design, and I'm burdened with two clients who use Helvetica so I know what I'm talking about, but it is often perfect for jobs that have such a strong photographic or design impact that any kind of playful type would just be too much .

While I personally think that such a thing is unlikely to actually happen and also that it isn't wrong at all to get between those two and to interpret and act as a catalysator in the communicative process, it seems that Miedinger succeeded in making Helvetica very very invisible. I think it says a LOT about German companies that they're so in love (or simply used to) this typeface&hellip; and I think that as a designer we shouldn't take Helv as granted but look for alternatives&hellip; but sometimes there simply is none.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Thanks. I much prefer the original one, though.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hmm, while the originals add to the 30s flair of the type, I think that Luc(as) version is more straightforward and the OSFs are more non-descript, fitting better in with a modern text and the clean cool look of the Futura. I don't know about the Foundry version, but the Neufville release doesn't wow me much, it's just too retro to be of practical use today. Luc's version retains a very modern touch.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Re Tv-Channel-Identification. I've been to an expo on the history of TV some years back and noticed that almost everything looked better designed and simpler and &hellip; just moe beautiful&hellip; in the early days of TV as a mass-medium. The 50s/60s screendesign, although there were terrible poopers as well, it just felt more relaxed than the overcoloured overanimated stuff we have today.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, most German TV-stations use Helvetica or something similar. The ARD uses the Thesis whole clan, which works surprisingly well on screen. Almost every show has its ID done in some of the Thesis fonts&hellip; and this gives us a coherent look yet still offers the single shows some individuality.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Also what does &quot;Anti-Renaissance-statement&quot; &gt;means?  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think Renner et al wanted the new typography of the 1920s as a concious statement against the typographic look coined by Venetian and French Renaissance. While Futura harkens back to the Capitalis Monumentalis in  that it is based on circles and squares as base forms, it is a geometric contruction, done with compasses and ruler, not created in a more dynamic way by hand with a nib/pen. That is what I mean by sterile. Although the finished version, of course, is by no way as regid as the first designs (the o, e.g., isn't just a circle anymore but rather returned to the slightly oval form we know since the 14th century to be optically correct, it still, imo, was a statement against the old-fashioned typography that went before the 20th century.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The digital Futura, btw, isn't too good for longer text, I think. The digial version needs a lot of manual kerning because of the geometric shape of the letters, and while with a LOT of manual editing you can get a decent looking text, it's just too much work to bother. Also, I tend to think that a more dynamic letterform is just more gentle on the reader :-D. I couldn't imagine reading a book or a lengthy article in Futura, even Helvetica would be better.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that Helvetica has stong virtues and terrible weaknesses. Its virtue is that it is very stong as a display type, while retaining some grace. Its weakness is that it is one of the most unreadable typefaces as a text face. Its value as a display face has, however, been almost totally eliminated by overuse.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even in display sizes, it can have problems with readability. Frutiger's opening up of letter forms in a Sans Serif certainly helped readability, and has been widely imitated.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Still, I wouldn't be surprised that if after 10 or 15 years, it couldn't be used judiciously as a display type and look very good again.</div>
