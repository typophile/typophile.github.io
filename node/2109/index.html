So, it&#39;s like a pun. <BR> <BR>But the second variant still makes me think it is better - I cannot really tell why. <BR> <BR>The email was sent. Waiting for reply from the client.

		<div class="commentbody">Hope you hear soon. Just  got enough time to try to catch up on my reading here. Alexey, I like your 2s too. Though I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if the client goes for the 1s. I think that the type is appropriate it looks solid but friendly. It looks <i>stable</i> and the colours give it an approachable and nice feel. <BR> <BR>The accent in accent <b>is</b> funny. I like the 2 series because I like the idea of some kind of comet-meteor- progress- forwardThinking-risingStars idea that occurs to me when I see it. It&#39;s so long though will it cause heartache in layouts? <BR> <BR>Good luck. Let us know when the client chooses! <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks everyone. <BR>I haven&#39;t heard anything from the client yet.

So I&#39;ve changed it to the ITC Legacy.

		<div class="commentbody">You know, ususally I would like the change of face, but this time I like the same face for both parts better. Is it the degree of contrast not being as high as it might be? Maybe. I just think the single face really makes the logo a single unit. <BR> <BR>I still like the 2s best, but you&#39;re probably right about the 1s as a practical matter. <BR> <BR>Truthfully this most recent version is excellent, and does its task in a most sincere and business-like manner. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the wording of the &#34;accent&#34;, that is in the last example of mine - but seems like people don&#39;t &#40;it&#39;s hard to get rid off this feeling since everyone is trying to suggest yet another variant&#41;. So what&#39;s wrong with mine? :D Just tell me straight. Is it too plain and simple? Not really expressive? Dull?... <BR> <BR>What bothers me is the type treatment of the &#34;accent&#34; - thus a bigger rendering. Also, I would like to hear more about the usage of secondary typeface &#40;ITC Legacy Sans, as already mentioned&#41; for the &#34;hr solutions&#34; phrase. I normally try to stay with one typeface throughout a logotype, but in this case I find using the same typeface for the smaller lettering a bit weak - it looks poor, I would even say badly legible. &#40;Seems, like I am critisizing myself even more, than the others :D &#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, these two points bother me. And as this seems to be a really quick job &#40;that is - next week the client has to have stationery and a bilingual website running&#41;, I think it&#39;s a high time deciding on a logo. <BR> <BR>Not that I am in a hurry, but... you know...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Alex, <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t know where you are with this job right now. Too late for feedback? <BR> <BR>Why did you choose the e for the accent? Just curious. Kinda makes me want to put the emphAsis on the wrong sylAble. What if it was on the a? I prefer #2 of your examples. It is more visually dynamic. <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m not crazy about Melior. It&#39;s a fine typeface, but in this case seems to lack personality. Try this &#40;it might help with your design slump too :-&#41; Print it out the word set in Melior nice and big. Get out some translucent paper &#40;tracing etc&#41; and work over the letters with a pencil. Alter the letterforms a bit, make it more like a bodoni, make it more like a slab serif, try a more even weight, try a sans serif Melior.  Move quick and use lots of paper. <BR> <BR>Oh, can it just be Accent HR? That rolls so much better. Words like solutions in a logo don&#39;t really add much IMHO. But clients will be clients. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Alexey, I haven&#39;t been able to check in until now. Wow I am suprised that there was such a strong negative reaction to the Melior, but then some people just don&#39;t get it. <BR> <BR>Of the examples that you show in the last instance I like the first and last best. The middle Helvetica one is just too boring. <BR> <BR>I like the look if the accent mark in the last, kind of  like a streaking meteor and it looks good with that slight triangle shape. <BR> <BR>I just can&#39;t help but think that if the client thinks that Melior=Rotis &#40;huh?&#41;, that even what you have shown here will be seen the same way. <BR> <BR>Other directions for the type &#40;to move it away from the client seeing the &#34;same kind of thing&#34; might be: Paralucent? Nick Shinn&#39;s Alphaville. FF faces - BJ is right. <BR> <BR>The thing about your design is because it&#39;s so typographic when the client says change the type your project almost starts over. <BR> <BR>I like the accent on the first one in the last example. <BR> <BR>Also maybe an accent that intrudes into the letterform? <BR> <BR>Hang in there. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

It&#39;s a human resources company, if you remember. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21091.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>As you see, I also tried the accent intrusion - doesn&#39;t really work very well. &#34;Comet&#34; thing is better, slicker, I would say. And then a human comes. How &#34;bad&#34; is that? <BR>To the typefaces. I have access to Adobe FontFolio, the pre-latest version, I think. I miss some fonts, but that&#39;s ok. My choice is basically limited to the Adobe type. If the type is chosen and approved, I go to myfonts.com and buy it. Yes, FontFolio cost me $3 for a cd in my motherland, but I do buy typefaces and tell the client, that he &#42;needs&#42; to buy one &#40;normally, a family&#41;, if he doesn&#39;t want any problems. Nobody - nobody - wants. Just interested - how would you try a FF font or Linotpye font &#40;I miss those so much&#41;, if you don&#39;t have one on your harddrive? Just curious. <BR>Also, why do I keep using Legacy throughout the designs? I do not know, how good or bad it is to use the same face in the logo and stationery and everywhere. Normally, a logo would be one font and corporate work horse would be something different. This time Legacy caught my heart, when I saw it in a letter. I do not know why I am trying to apply it for a logotype. Maybe I am wrong at this point. <BR>So, that&#39;s why so many different faces. The client will definitely see less. <BR>Now you turn. I hope, the last round for this job. <BR> <BR>Best regards to this board, <BR>Alex <BR> <BR>ps. upper row: Legacy Sans; middle row: Delta and Stone Sans; lower row: Legacy and Stone</div>

That didn&#39;t work. <BR> <BR>I like the Human T direction. The thing about that is that it looks somehow too small. The dot, the t, maybe both look too small. I don&#39;t know. I like the idea. <BR> <BR>Keep at it. The comet thing does really work if you have to go with it. I would &#40;if time permits&#41; try some different sizes and combos of color in the Human T series to see if it can balance out. Of the Human T series presented here I like the first example the best. <BR> <BR>Daniel, did you mean that the Human T idea resembles too much sign figures, or is there a particular logo that springs to mind? I can only think of stick people holding hands in a circle to create a starburst. :-P</div>

Not to polute this board with my subtle changes in the designs, I won&#39;t post anything for now. He should reply me within an hour. We&#39;ll see. <BR> <BR>About the human type. The guy I was talking about it last night &#40;<a href="http://daveraspin.com" target="_blank">http://daveraspin.com</a>&#41; was refering to his &#34;olympic games&#34; pitch and i&#39;s and j&#39;s in a human form. If we take existing M and T humans - we already have a good start for a new face! ^_^ <BR> <BR>Oh, Scott, your pal is a pervert if he thinks about sexuality when seeing that human T, word. ^_^ <BR> <BR>cheers!</div>

No! I have to cut my hands off, probably, but I am still doing some changes. &#40;my <a href="http://xtati.com/_misc/desktop_T.gif">illustrator battle field</a> looks really bad&#41; <BR>Anyways.

I stick with my endorsement of the number 3 design referred to above. <BR> <BR>But then of course the really cool Human T in a circle would mean less. But then I think it&#39;s cool enough on its own. <BR> <BR>I think that if your client is good with this then you should stop and do the stationery and make the use guidelines. I really do. This stuff could take forever, but I think you already nailed it with 3 above and guy in the circle. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Scott, hey Jon, <BR>why so negative about the legs now? I was feeling really good last night after I posted it - and was, frankly speaking, awaiting for something more opitmistic, than &#34;lose those legs, dude&#34;. :D Not that I am somehow offended or anything - I just don&#39;t get it. It looks really &#34;original&#34; now, not resembling anything at all, isn&#39;t it? The legs do help the T to be even more human than before. Sweet, cute? I say - more straightforward. <BR>Santiago, thanks for the tip. Dangerously close, yes. <BR> <BR>Last night, when at home, I was again looking at the leggy humat T thing and was thinking, that this is now the end. Today morning I&#39;ve come back to office - and now I don&#39;t even know why I don&#39;t like anything else from my designs anymore. <BR> <BR>Plus, are you sure, it should be circle, not elipse? The circle looks to geometric to me - way too much - to be used with a font like Ocean/Legacy/Stone/[even] Delta... not? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Alex &#40;almost crying&#41; <BR> <BR>:D</div>
