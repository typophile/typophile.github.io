  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I did a job last year, making new text-templates for a Norwegian publisher. I ended up using Minion and FF Kievit. It worked out just perfect, but now, one year later we&#39;re revising the templates cause we&#39;re having problems with Kievit. <BR> <BR>I had FF cut a special version with normal figures in Kievit Regular, and OSF in Kievit Caps. Mainly for practical usage. But ever since we started using the new templates, we&#39;ve had postscript errors because of the typeface from here to eternity. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Now I have to find a substitute. Any suggestions. What I&#39;m looking for is a legible OpenType font &#40;Kievit is not OT&#41;, with true Caps and Italic. It has to be friends with Minion, and have atleast weights in regular, medium and bold. <BR> <BR>Rune D</div>

They really didn&#39;t seem to know what was causing the problem. I suspect there&#39;s something fishy abot the version they sent back to us, and that&#39;s what makes this situation kinda hopless.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all the replies. <BR> <BR>I had a look at Avenir Next, and most likely I&#39;ll recomend it for my client, even though I find it a little to geometrical for my taste. Personally I have no problems with Kievit. It&#39;s a great font, and I think Mike Abbink has done a wonderful job. I have never experienced the postscript errors myself &#40;even though it might have seemed that way&#41;, but it seems to be a common problem among the others working for this publisher. This publisher produces in between 60 - 100 books a year. <BR> <BR>As I mentioned I haven&#39;t experienced these problems myself. I work in InDesign 2/3, but I know that several others use Fram Maker for practical reasons. I&#39;ve had plenty of discussions on why they still use FM. I would also like to mention that in saying &#39;the others&#39;, I&#39;m talking about people who don&#39;t have any typographic education ... they just make books. What&#39;s a correct English term for this? They might be clever at using the programs, fast and cheap, but sadly no passion. But I guess that&#39;s a common problem. &#40;Do I sound irritated?&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway ... I will also have a talk with FF in Germany to see if they know what&#39;s wrong, because the best would be to keep using Kievit.</div>

I.e. generating several indexes in one document ... but I&#39;m note sure of this. Another thing is that I don&#39;t know if ID3 has eased working with footnotes and sideheads. I suspect that FM is still a bit more practical for longer documents. I&#39;m starting a 500 page book in ID next week, with sideheads. So I&#39;ll be back then to post reports. <BR> <BR>But ...

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, thereis some research suporting the use of serif type over sans serif for long texts but this is not a clear choice based on data of an entire set of typographic specs and there isn&#39;t that much difference in readability anyway.  You find variances in the data based on where the testing was done and the backgrounds of the the people sampled.  There are even cultural differences hinting at the possibility that you can read better that which you are more used to reading &#40;people from countries where sans serif is prevalent read it better than people from countries where it is not&#41;. <BR>I personally prefer sans serif for text so long as it is in a good typeface and set with good typography.  I find Bodoni to be an incredible beautiful typeface which I use often when it can be set large enough but find it too difficult to read at smaller &#34;book sizes&#34;. <BR>Once upon a time, books were set in blackletter &#40;which is very hard to read for people today&#41;.  There probably was some outcry when people first started using Roman type to set books. <BR> <BR>Why do we need such absolute rules today when anything is possible?  There always fas been good and bad in the design of everything.  Time has a way of sorting it out but not always in the way we might predict.  The paintings of the French Academy were the rage of their day and those of the Fauves were looked upon with disdain.  Today the tables are turned.  Let typgraphers use whatever types they deem best, serif, sans or mix.  When done well, I welcome them all. <BR> <BR>The world is a big place and technology has made it possible for us to do things quickly which were never possible before.  We don&#39;t need to stymie typographers with iron-clad rules from previous generations.  We should have open minds and let the talents of typgraphers now and in the future come to bear.  Some will succeed and some will fail but none will succeed if we don&#39;t let them try. <BR> <BR>Chris L</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not absolute rules, but guidelines are helpful. One of them in fact is: all things being equal, serifs help readability. There is both empirical and anecdotal evidence to support this, and virtually none for sans fonts. Besides evidence, it also happens to make great sense once you get a grasp of how people actually read. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html" target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html</a> <BR> <BR>Furthermore, a text font is not like a painting: it&#39;s much more about our subconscious reading &#34;firmware&#34; and a lot less about fashion. <BR> <BR>As for Familiarity, it is indeed important, but it&#39;s still only half the story &#40;at most&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
