body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nNice to be back here again.\r\nEven though I'm looking for a
  definitive solution, the theoretical foundation of it is also important to me.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThere
  is a coffee bar opening up soon with a name \"e spre ssionist\" (written together
  \u2013 I just want to avoid search enging indexing here). Obviously, it plays with
  words espresso and expressionism which should translate into \"the art of coffee\".
  The concept is \u2013 the best coffee in town. Though I don't have anything to do
  with actually selecting coffee and grinders and machines, the identity for the enterprise
  should reflect the wordplay and make it stand out from the crowd of regular coffee
  bars.\r\n\r\nI was doing some research on expressionism and it seems that this art
  movement didn't influence so much typography as other disciplines, like art (foremost)
  and architecture. At the same period of time typography was going in a quite different
  direction \u2013 Jan Tschichold's dogmatic views, Paul Renner's Futura, Johnston/Gill
  Sans, Neuzeit S, etc. The \"machine age\" in full color, so to say.\r\nSo I was
  thinking of combining these two aesthetics \u2013 a sign in expressionism style
  and a typeface in a more straightforward manner \u2013to play with pictures as the
  word itself suggests.\r\n\r\nAnd I am lost in type. It seems, I am stuck in a loop.
  Initially I've started from geometric sans (Futura, Gotham), moving to a more condensed
  typefaces (FF Good), to \"defaults\" (Akzidenz). Then I went through a phase of
  \"modern machinery age\", looking through monospaced type (Lineto's Excellent and
  some Gestalten Type) and finally arriving at stencil type (AG Book and custom stenciled
  Archer). Obviously, I am lost.\r\nThe design has its constrains: the word should
  sit in lower case, as the icon hints on the lc \"e\".\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/e-brushed_5017.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\npop"

    however I am not sure it matches this e-daub :) well enough. I somehow see the
    type in contrast to the icon. It would also be nice to be able to use such a font
    as a headline face for menus, etc.\r\n\r\n@T\xE9\r\nThanks for the tip. It seems
    to be a free font?"

  body: "It's completely off strategy, being rigidly constrained by its intellectual
    premise, rather than expressionist.\r\nAs I said, your main typeface should carry
    the theme of expressionism, as it will be far more visible than the symbol.\r\nI
    get the impression you really want to do something clean and modern with the typography,
    and rationalize that in some way, no matter how off territory that would be.\r\nBut
    WTF, why not use the default art gallery font, posh Helvetica\u2014Akzidenz Grotesk.\r\n"

  body: "Frankly, yes, I am inclined to use clean typography for this thing, though
    \"clean & modern\" has a broad definition. :)\r\nThe icon will not be used as
    much anyway, you are right here. Actually, I am thinking of taking the brush stroke
    and using it for other small applications, doing other graphics in this style.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I do not see a humanist sans or expressionist face pulling out the job here. I
    don't know why, I can't reason that. A perfect find would be a family, with slabs
    and sans and serifs or stencils (Stag by Commercial Type / Jigsaw by Typotheque
    / Primetype's Manual maybe?) to use them interchangeably for headlines, menus,
    promotions, etc. Search for Bauholzdesign to see what the bar will look like inside
    \u2013 and to mix this picture with a playful typeface?\r\n\r\nAs I said in my
    first post, the biggest reasoning for me is to support the wordplay with image-play:
    expressionism and machine age, both happening almost at the same historic period.
    I might be wrong. I might be trying to justify myself. Trully, I am a bit out
    of breath... (but I am still listening carefully)"

    looks quite authentic on its own, don't you think?\r\nBut it doesn't fit well
    with the icon \u2013 and redrawing the icon is not an option.\r\n\r\nSo I went
    back to Storm Type again and am now pretty sure it will be Splendid Sans for headlines
    + Wallbaum Grotesk for running copy. Splendid Serif is a good option to have,
    too (have bought both of them).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/es2_6038.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/es22_3727.jpg]"

    energy\" in the typefaces, say Stag Sans, eventually with Stag Sans Dotted for
    adds/menu card as a bonus. \r\nI think your \"caffeine e\" needs a more cleaned-up,
    but still very dynamic typeface to get balance and contrast. The Sans you now
    use, is more like \"too much caffeine\", instead of a nice shot of tasteful and
    strong cafe solo (which i see in Stag Sans). Just my 2 cents.  "
