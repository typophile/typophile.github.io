  body: "I don't know about anyone else, but I like numbers 4 and 6 more than the
    final. The final I think is just too black, and I like the whole positive/negative
    overlay that happens in number 6, and number 4 I think is a good start...it still
    looks a little pieced together though. Perhaps if you made the little C the same
    thickness as the rest of it, it would appear to be more unified. Good luck.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "I think apart from 1 and 2 a reader will have trouble seeing 2 c's, and 3,
    4 and 5 the D is obscured. I believe part of the problem is the small serifs of
    copperplate. I would recommend that you try printing the elements onto acetate
    and try overlaying and moving them until you get a clearer composition.\r\nTim"

    body: yes, I started designing from the start with the computer. I agree that
      yes it may be a little rigid. I'll sketch out some ideas on paper...
