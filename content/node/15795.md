  characteritics. This would be for the body of the text. Then I was really thinking

    you think that they were more inspired by the entirety of the work he was doing
    as opposed to his typefaces, per se? I mean Baskervilled was exploring the new
    paper that could hold the sharper serif. Perhaps they, Bodoni and Didot, were
    more interested in that fact than the typefaces. Yes, I'm speculating. But it
    seems to me they had in their minds something different which would take advantage
    of the advances which  Baskerville was making in paper technology.\r\n\r\nI don't
    remember the story. So, I could be wrong, but it seems to me that either Bodoni
    went on a trip toward meeting Baskerville or one of the Didots. But, they became
    sick and had to return. This ring any bells?"

  body: No. I think they just took what Baskerville was doing one step further by
    eliminating most/all bracketing in the serif. One could say that Baskerville was
    playing it safe and the Didots and Bodoni wanted to see how far they could get
    away without bracketing. Maybe?

  body: Just my personal thoughts, but I wouldn't suggest placing two serifed faces
    together on a design for the simple fact that they are too close (design-wise)
    to one another. There wouldn't be enough constrast between the two faces to look
    intentional. Both faces, in my opinion, are gorgeous and you could achieve that
    traditional, romantic, classical look that it seems you are going for, but placing
    them together would look like a mistake. Perhaps using different weights of the
    same font, i.e. regular with an italic, or just using a serif with a clean, sophisticated
    sans serif. One that comes to mind is Helvetica Nueue.

    use Bodoni for display with a nice text cut of Walbaum. In any case there is too

    \r\n\r\nI'd like to put some of my thoughts here too, but please, bare in mind
    that I may say some really newbie-dumbish things.\r\n\r\nConsidering it's a book
    about the history of ballet, which inevitably will be associated with 'classics'
    (music, art, whatever), I can understand the choice for a romantic type... and
    serifs.\r\n\r\nMixing serif with sans-serif seem a little like breaking the 'classic'
    mood of the book.\r\n\r\nI always associated sans-serif with realist, modernist
    and post.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm too stuck with Robert Bringhurst saying something like
    a perfect type would be 'invisible'... would just 'honor the text'.\r\n\r\nI don't
    know, maybe serif and sans would bring too much attention to the type... a little
    too much.\r\n\r\nI'm not arguing, complaining, accusing or anything like that...
    I'm just trying to broad my mind... a little.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all your

  body: "My view, Lucien, is that the Bringhurst/Noordzij view of Bodoni as a typographic
    Romantic, his forms whimsically calligraphic, is not only unhelpful but willfully
    paradoxical. Firstly, Bodoni's mature letterforms are duller than all contemporary
    forms excepting the Didots'. One need only examine any competent writing or engraving
    of the period to confirm this. Secondly, the larval Bodoni followed first the
    slaphead clumsiness of the rationalist, deist (not Baroque) Baskerville, who,
    unable to make type himself, could not learn even to judge it: his lc a is too
    fat, and his patronising disparagement of Caslon absurd. Thirdly, Bodoni cut punches
    for specific uses, making his work more like lettering than our ideal of infinitely
    combinable type. That his text sizes were not so specifically varied is irrelevant,
    because Bodoni famously sought only magnificence and knew nothing of sweetness
    in the mass. His texts were faulty and his whitespace unfunctional; he was not
    a typographer so much as a graphic designer. This matters because Romanticism
    is, when successful, the mode of the mobile consciousness, and the progessing
    sentence: the paragraph, or book, rather than the title page. Bodoni cared more
    for titles than for text. The most genuinely Romantic type designs are those like
    Deepdene, the letters of which are perhaps too dramatic taken individually, but
    which combine to very subtle effect.\r\n\r\nGeorge"

    his \"a\" was a bit chunky*, but there are worse things; and Caslon was indeed
    a hack. The only real problem in Baskerville's type is that the italic is completely
    botched - and nobody has managed to really make it work... yet.\r\n\r\n* The \"a\"

    combo work might be to match up different versions of the text Bodoni and display
    Baskerville, and see if any interesting relationships appear. Of course that does
    depend on having printed specimens -- the FontBook is useful. And I don't know

  body: I really like Hrant's idea of using the Bodoni (a display cut, of course)
    for titling. But I'm not sure what the text should be. You could experiment a
    bit with some different faces, and you could always come back to Bodoni for text.
    Then again, you may want to try something French for a book on the history of
    ballet. Seems appropriate, but I do like Bodoni for this kind of project.
