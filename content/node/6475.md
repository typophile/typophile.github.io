  faces I&#39;m about to get for a zine I&#39;m starting soon &#40;see <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/42111.html?1093379073">here</a>&#41;.
  I&#39;ve spent untold hours over the past month tracking these down &#40;I&#39;ve
  probably seen three quarters of the myfonts catalog&#41;, but I&#39;m still not
  100% sure there isn&#39;t something closer to what I&#39;m looking for out there.
  Some more experienced eyes would be very helpful at this point before I make a final
  decision. <BR> <BR>Specifically, I&#39;m wondering three things: <BR>1. Are there
  any faces that are similar to the two display faces? A more boisterous version of
  the egyptian perhaps?  <BR>2. Do the two display faces together seem anachronistic?
  Ditto for the text and display together. I would use the roman display with the
  Walbaum roman and the italic display with Fournier italic, for the most part. <BR>3.
  And can anyone recommend a ornament/dingbat font do go with this combination? My
  eyes glazed over after two hours in the Dingbatcave. I will probably get Fournier
  ornaments to go with Fournier, but it doesn&#39;t extensive enough. <BR> <BR>Display:

  body: These typefaces have an amazing flavor. A nice old world stew. Why not put
    a page or two together with them. Show us how you invision them working together.
    I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d keep looking. These faces are fresh and underused
    in some ways. That will set your zine apart from the others.

    target="_blank"> this thread</a>. <BR> <BR>However i do like what you&#39;ve posted
    here. Lemme hunt around for a dingbat set... <BR> <BR>...Actually, I really like
    the ornaments in Adobe&#39;s Warnock... if you have that one. but what style of
    ornaments are you looking to match with these fonts?

    with your current selections

  body: While you are visiting PsyOps, check out Deadwood. That might be nice for
    smaller uses, or even larger uses instead of Wade.

  body: Yay, I&#39;m glad you like them Tiffany <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I would love to put a page together to show but I haven&#39;t
    bought them yet...  <BR> <BR>Paul, I wasn&#39;t exactly sure what style of ornaments
    I was looking for... though I think I might have found something. &#40;I liked
    the PsyOps ones too by the way.&#41; I bought Fournier Ornaments last night, and
    even though I am satisfied with it, I still think I need another dingbat font.
    And lo and behold, I come across <a href="http://www.p22.com/products/victorian.html">P22&#39;s
    Victorian Ornaments</a>, which just might be what I need, and inexpensive too.
    Their <a href="http://www.p22.com/products/woodtypeset.html">Woodtype Extras </a>are
    pretty good too, and I&#39;m not sure which would go with Wade better. What do
    you guys think? The Victorian Gothic that comes with it might prove handy as well.
    <BR> <BR>The only thing I was hoping for that neither seem to have is a lot of
    square tiles for making tiled backgrounds, a la <a href="http://dingbatcave.com/woodblocks1.shtml">Dingbatcave
    Woodblocks</a>. But I could probably just make a few simple tiles in Illustrator
    if I really needed some. <BR> <BR>I guess the only thing holding me back is that
    there seems to be, esp. if I get those P22 ornaments, a tension between the Victorian
    display and dingbat faces on the one hand, and the rationalist 18th century copy
    faces. <BR> <BR>PS - that link didn&#39;t give me any slab-serif inspiration Paul,
    but the lamp/sculpture piece was nice <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Whoa! How come I only came across a quarter of those? It is starting to sink
    in that there are tons of foundries that don&#39;t have their stuff on myfonts.com
    &#40;not that that&#39;s the ONLY place I&#39;ve been looking&#41;. That&#39;s
    a really great thread.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m beginning to like the Victorian vibe
    though, and the layering options on Wade is a big part of that. So I think I will
    go with that. I&#39;m still going to look around for something better than Slanted
    Antique Roman -- it&#39;s about 90% what I&#39;m looking for, but something is
    a little off, I don&#39;t know what. Though I&#39;m a bit discouraged with font-hunting
    -- it seems like half of the gems are hidden away in independent foundries that
    I don&#39;t even know exist until someone brings them up here... <BR> <BR>If I
    can afford it I will probably get one of those slab-serifs on that thread, or
    Deadwood, for sidebars, etc., much how sans-serifs are often used.

  body: I bit the bullet and went for the Victorian ornaments, Farao, and Wade. I&#39;m
    having a major problem with the latter though, as I just posted &#40;<a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/48253.html?1094420989">here</a>&#41;
    on the Build forum. I looked around for something to replace Slanted Antique Roman
    but couldn&#39;t find anything, so I think I&#39;m content with it. <BR> <BR>If
    I can get the Wade problem figured out maybe I&#39;ll post a couple pages here
    in a week or two like Tiffany suggested.
