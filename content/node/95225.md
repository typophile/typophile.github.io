body: Hello, so I designed a rough draft of my cousin's bands album art a year or
  so ago, and in my infinite wisdom did not save a .psd! I was using a bootlegged
  Photoshop Cs5 Extended (as part of Master Collection) at the time, and now have
  the Creative Cloud if that is at all helpful. I am also a Windows 7 user btw with
  Microsoft Office 2010. And there is an overlap of another font underneath it, which
  I have identified as "Vladmir Script". I also vaguely remember it being somewhere
  about 1/2 or 3/4 down on my font list, maybe around the letters M,N,O,P,Q,R,S, but
  that could be totally false (I don't download a huge amount of fonts, so it is mostly
  the default for whatever my computer was at the time). Thanks SO much for the help
  and sorry if these "details" don't help at all or hinder you.
