body: "\xA1Hola! \r\nI'm sorry, I'm sure this has been asked a trillion times at least!
  But I haven't found anything. :-/\r\n\r\nSo what's the word from people who read
  Spanish on the vertical position of the inverted exclamation (and question) mark?
  I've read it can be aligned with the \"normal\" marks i.e. at cap height, or it
  can descend & only reach the x-line on top. Because I still haven't studied any
  Spanish (been meaning to for years), I have no idea which option is more common,
  or preferred. Opinions?"

    fonts with the inverted exclamation and question marks in either and occasionally
    both cap-height and x-height positions. It makes sense for them to be at the cap
    height, since they are placed at the beginning of a question or exclamation which
    is usually a complete sentence which begins with a capital letter. However, I
    understand how a descending punctuation mark in those places would be desirable
    as it would be more easily differentiated. \r\n\r\nI'll get back to you on this."

    too, how one solution seems more \"logical\", but the other one less confusing.
    Thanks for investigating, that's very cool!\r\n\r\nJos: Great idea. Although putting
    it in the case feature would probably presuppose that the descending form is fine
    as a choice for mixed-case? But I guess I could put the \"lining\" ones in a salt
    feature as well, so users can easily select them to use with mixed-case text too,
    if they prefer. I might just do that."

  body: 'This is actually an issue in some of my fonts: due to the very large x-height,
    the difference between a cap-height and descended inverted mark is very minimal,
    or else I''m not dropping them far enough. My instinct is to drop them so the
    end of the stroke rises to the x-height with the dot above. Perhaps I need to
    bring the whole thing down further? When I bring the dot down to x-height, the
    stroke drops farther than descenders.'

    at how it is simply reversed and drop to your descender height.  The two really
    should be the same height.  Interference can be expected from the y and the j

    the dot to center around the height of the serif on a capital B, D, etc. I usually
