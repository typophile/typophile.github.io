body: Sorry, I am new, and was curious to the foundry or font of Wired&#39;s sans-serif
  headline and deck fonts. They also seem to use several different body fonts.. Any
  ideas? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance.

    there are <BR>plenty of display fonts mixed in for feature heds. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?FU"

  body: Although Wired does use Akzidenz Grotesk for heads and decks, most body copy
    is set in Univers or Univers Condensed.

  body: 'That&#39;s what I guessed Max, but they use serif fonts sometimes for special
    features. <BR> <BR>For example &#40;will post scan later&#41;: In the April issue,
    there is an article by Joshua Davis on the hologram that can bring peace to a
    hotly contested area of the Holy Land in the middle east. It is set entirely in
    a heavy serif. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the responses again.'
