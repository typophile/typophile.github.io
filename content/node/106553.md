body: "I recently acquired an HP laptop with Windows 8. It's pretty fast, yet I'm
  unsure if it was worth it (I got it because a Macbook of similar characteristics
  cost 3 times more), but basically because I was using (and still) an iMac for about
  4 years and I kind of get used too much to many of their friendlier quirks. Typography
  related, I miss from Windows:\r\n\r\n\u2014The Mac keyboard allows to type additional
  characters besides the default layout much easier (the ones from the legacy Apple
  character encoding), which for me at least is very useful. I haven't found a good
  way to make the same on Windows 8 yet.\r\n\u2014Windows \"Character map\" is pretty
  dull looking comparer to the Mac equivalent and, unlike Mac, it hasn't been updated
  from years! (even if additional Unicode characters are still being added to their
  fonts).\r\n\u2014It don't have any fancy app to manage the fonts, although unlike
  Mac, I like they keep all in the same folder.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? It was worth
  it? Besides typography, I also work with Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator and Premiere.
  All of the stuff is cross-plataform, but I'm starting to worry that were I work
  most people use Mac exclusive Final Cut for video edition."

  body: "You can get an alternate keyboard layout that mimics that of a Mac here:\r\nhttp://ohkine.tumblr.com/post/376098469/macintosh-keyboard-layouts-for-windows\r\n\r\nI
    consider it a must even though I\u2019ve never been a Mac person. It sometimes
    behaves a little oddly in InDesign (you\u2019ll see what I mean after using it
    for a few days), but other than that works perfectly.\r\n\r\nA popular, free font
    manager is NexusFont, and it also includes its own character map. I\u2019ve experimented
    with it, and it seemed nice, but it just wasn\u2019t necessary enough for me to
    get into the habit of using it."

  body: "Oh, also, it only just occurred to me that it would be helpful for you to
    know that in Windows, you\u2019re much better off learning the \u201Calt codes\u201D
    for often-used special characters than making frequent trips to the Character
    Map and back.\r\n\r\nYou can see them in the lower right corner of the Character
    Map windows (where it says \u201CKeystroke\u201D), and you enter them by holding
    the left Alt key and entering the numeric code on your numpad (including any leading
    zeroes), so an em-dash, for example, is Alt+0151."
