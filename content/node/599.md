  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR>
  <BR>Something like this, but written like a pangram: <BR> <BR>&#34;The strength
  of the party is the unity with the motherland&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m really out of
  ideas, and my english isn&#39;t that great... Anyone care to help? It should ideally
  contain &#34;the party&#34;, but anything that sounds political is good. <BR> <BR>Thanks '

    1000x1400 mm.  <BR> <BR>I know that pangrams often yields clumsy results, but
    I feel it would be nicer than just writing the alphabet. One way around might
    be to collect a few of the typical catch-phrases for the revolutionary parties,
    and do some sort of text collage... <BR> <BR>I think it would be nice to use all
    the letters, but it doesn&#39;t neccesarily have to be one sentence now that I
    think about it. <BR> <BR>Thanks '

    funky because of the anti-aliasing also, illustrator doesn&#39;t do a very good
    job on that all the time. <BR> <BR>The lower portion was a rush job, and since
    it has got a typo, I&#39;m thinking &#40;if it&#39;s not printed yet&#41; of scrapping
    the idea with a pangram all togheter, and just use it down to the world domination
    part.  <BR> <BR>It will probably have a greater impact &#40;it will look bigger!&#41;,
