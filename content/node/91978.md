  in the Tomo Neko Maid Cafe logo. I've attached a .png of the logo, but a direct
  link to a lower-resolution .gif is here: http://tomoneko.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tomoneko_logo_header_20122.gif
  . This logo was created in 2010-2011.\r\n\r\nI've been told that the only fonts
  used in the logo were Blippo (which I figured is what was used for \"Tomo Neko\")
  and Century Gothic. If it is Century Gothic, then it's been very, very heavily modified.
  Since I don't have the skills to do anything like that, I'd appreciate it if a substitute
  font could be recommended.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!"

    \"Garden\" the name of the font and Ellinor & Cheryl Rapp are the creators? Sorry
    if that's a dumb question. :(\r\n\r\nThanks!"
