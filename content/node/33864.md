  body: This is not really a "font" per se. There are machines for engraving letters
    in metal using a cutting tool. This looks typical of that method. They don't use
    "fonts" in the normal sense, instead tracing paths in the shape of letters. <a
    href="http://www.suregrave.com/wizzard-st.html">Here is an example of what I mean.</a>
    Originally, before they worked with computers, you would actually trace a sort
    of template with letters cut into it with a sort of pantographic mechanism. I
    remember seeing one of these when I was a kid. I believe the letter shapes go
    back to those older machines.

    Lettering Guides</a> worked on a similar principle -- you trace the letter shapes
    that are engraved into a template and the pen (or engraving tool) at the end of
    the pantographic device reproduces the letter shape.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
