  body: ' Have you been looking at Alien:Grey3?... <BR> <BR>I think the dot pattern
    idea is great, especially considering the insecty name. I think I  prefer the
    &#34;M&#34; asymmetrical, and not too dark. So maybe take #3 and make it more
    asymmetrical - one dot difference just looks like a mistake. <BR> <BR>As for the
    subhead, I think Mantinia &#40;is it?&#41; actually works, but the one in #2 sucks.
    Try Meridien too. <BR> <BR>BTW: <BR>&#62; gouvernment <BR> <BR>You&#39;re canadienne,

    here, Hranter. <BR> <BR>I like the middle top M with the serif text &#40;whatever
    it is&#41;  <BR>from the top left. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s see them small. Most logos
    are rarely seen larger than a half-inch.

    gimme some credit, and you typophiles shame shame...its Hoefler Text! the second
    is Eurostile...Actually what I did there considering the company wants something
    that shows intelligence - I looked at the Mensa logo, fliped the corporate name
    to Eurostile extended instead of condensed and vice versa with consulting for
    Mensa International. I thought what better way to associate intelligence then
    to subliminally call attention from the intelligent ones. ok maybe that&#39;s
    a lame game-plan...but its a sans serif version so far at least. <BR> <BR>yes
    my grammar and spelling are horrible, happens when you grow up north french canadian,
    and then work with south bilingual anglophones. '

  body: I&#39;m with Stephen. I&#39;d use that middle M, but I&#39;m  <BR>still unconvinced.
    I see what you&#39;re doing with  <BR>the juxtaposition of the &#39;edgy&#39;
    M and the  <BR>traditional type, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re there yet. <BR>
    <BR>What if the entire setting weren&#39;t so ordinary. I <BR>mean, you&#39;ve
    got this big M with centered type <BR>under it. What if the M became more of a
    textural <BR>mark that reads as an M only secondarily? <BR>What if it were 25%
    of its size and not centered. <BR> <BR>&#40;Stephen our HTML isn&#39;t really

  body: ' Yeah... why does it have to be an &#34;M&#34;? Think of all the cool logos
    that don&#39;t use an initial. What if Lucent&#39;s logo were a big red L instead
    of that crazy-cool red circle? What if Nike had Ns instead of swooshes? <BR> <BR>Think
    of what the company does, conceptually. On the larger scale, what is the &#34;grandma
    explanation&#34; of what they do for humanity?  <BR> <BR>Communicate that thought. '

  body: thanks for your comments and suggestions...the whole M thing is a long story
    - one we as an office had already discussed.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m rushing around
    right now - just handed the presentation papers to meeting go&#39;ers. <BR> <BR>the
    top one is one I lay&#39;ed out pres style and the bottom are variations I&#39;m
    offering for now. <BR> <BR>thank you all muchly for opinions <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"

  body: ' Nice work. I think that the third one on the bottom is starting to read
    as &#34;2 people working on a common focus&#34; and thats a good thing that possibly
    could be emphasized even more with a slight rearrangement of the circles? Perhaps
    the type could be more closely working with the mark? &#40;a foundation for it?&#41;
    Just some thoughts hope they are helpful. '
