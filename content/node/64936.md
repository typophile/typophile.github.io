  body: "Yeah, I went through it, but without result :-(\r\nFrom the fact that you
    fine lot don't recognise it, I deduct that it is indeed a custom production (and
    a mighty fine one).\r\n\r\nSo a logical question would be... could anyone suggest
    me a similar script font... equally brass and cheerful without too much curls?\r\n\r\nThank
    you all!"
