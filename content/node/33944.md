  \"closer\" and \"pick-up\". Rather than bookmark the website i wrote down names
  of typefaces in hope of later purchase; now in desperate search of that website
  since i can't find this two typefaces anywhere on the web.\r\n\r\nGoogle is returning
  results regarding \"picking up the right font\" and \"using the font wich is closer
  to ..\" not paying attention to zilion of my keyword combinations and tricks.\r\n\r\nI'd
  be very grateful for any information regarding this two typefaces!"

    my butt a million time for this very thing. \r\n\r\nAlas, I don't know of either
    of those fonts or where/who to get them from."

      it, but with no reply."
