  recently obtained. I'm in the process of organizing them, and printing specimen,
  either to trace or to use later on when I want to print something with it.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I have several typefaces, and traced only a couple of letters of one face, very
  quickly (of off hi-res photos of the woodtype itself) to post it here. When I have
  a proper print, I will scan it and post it, and the other faces too, when I have
  printed them.\r\n\r\nI only know the typefaces were bought from someone, I guess
  a printer, about 20 odd years ago, but the faces are obviously older than that.
  And I'm (and thus the faces too) situated in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nHopefully there
  are some woodtype connaisseurs on this board.. ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/woodtype_6672.jpg]"

  body: "Hey, those actually look very similar. Some characters look very much alike,
    others do not. I guess it's not the same as Block and Hermes. But lots of thanks
    for the insight, since my face is probably from the same time, and maybe from
    germany too.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone has another suggestion? Although I do realise
    this is only a few characters, I will upload more asap."

  body: "I've printed everything. And have an image of the whole alphabet.\r\nMy itention
    was to digitize the typeface, mainly for myself as a first step into type-design,
    beziers/fontlab, etc.\r\n\r\nAnyone seen this face before, now there are more
    characters to see?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scans1vel_3693.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    have another, smaller, version of this typeface in wood as well. All characters
    but the 'a' are the same as this one, only a bit more extended, confirming the
    thought that the version I'm posting is condensed. Will scan that 'a' as well
    when I have some more time.\r\nI have not included the uppercase yet, I have to
    scan those first as well."
