body: I've tried to ID this myself but I'm not finding anything that I feel is exact.
  It appears that some of the letters were modified, but will someone please ID the
  base font used. Thanks.

  body: "I think this is something that has been customized, and that's why no one
    can ID it. The closest starting point I can suggest is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-expanded/|Century
    Expanded Bold]] from Bitstream. The C, A, E and R all need modification, but your
    sample does perhaps look like those letters are less smoothly shaped, indicating
    the possibility if them having been edited.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: From the looks of it (inconsistencies, odd proportions here and there), I
    would say this is an old hand-drawn design, not based on any particular typeface.
