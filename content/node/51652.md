  There are quite a few flaws that I am working on right now, but I'd like to see
  what other people think. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schriftbild

  body: "Your curve-to-line joins (like on the d and others) are too thick. This is
    a natural result of pushing a circle into a stem of the same line weight. Fixing
    it however would require breaking your strict geometric rule,but since it isn't
    followed at other places it should be an option.\r\n\r\nThe curl of the at mark
    starts at a drop below the a shape making it look like a q. \r\n\r\nSome of your
    glyphs look like they came from different fonts (thorns, ampersand, dollar sign,
    math Greek). These should be unified. Also your accents are sized inconsistently."

  body: "Hi Zach\r\nsome observations...not a professional so feel free to ignore...:)\r\nAs
    well as the optical correction mentioned above, on the joins, I think you need
    some overshoot on the round shapes.\r\nThere seem to be different weights on some
    of your curves. E.g. c looks quite darker than b.\r\nB looks narrow."

  body: "Really like this! There is a charming clumsiness to it. However...\r\n\r\nI'm
    not a type designer,but from a graphic designers perspective, if I was using the
    typeface, the uppercase W would annoy me. Would work as an alternative character,
    but I would prefer something more like the lower case w, which is really nice!
    Basically, I'd rather have a more 'normal' W, and have the option of a fancier
    version if I wished.\r\n\r\n I don't really like the uppercase R either, but that
    is just personal preference. Also the uppercase G is too blotchy at the bottom. "

  body: "I don't like how the leg (could someone put me right - is that the correct
    term?) of the R appears to stick out further than the bowl. It looks like your
    B, just with a broken bum, making it look out of proportion and condensed.\r\n\r\nI
    would either extend the bowl, or straighten out the leg - more like the Akzidenz
    Grotesk R, than the Helvetica R.\r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense!"
