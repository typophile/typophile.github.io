		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Sally, the mark is difficult to read. I can maybe see the &quot;l&quot; and &quot;e&quot; without knowing the word.  However, I like the exploration you're doing with the type and think that you could be on to something.  Taking the idea of the word &quot;pulse&quot; could offer up some interesting solutions.  What about establishing a rhythm in the design that helps distinguish one letter from the next. You could play with varying baselines or the idea of alternating letters getting closer and further away.  I should also say that I like the way the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;e&quot; are connected in your 2nd example.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">alex&ndash;i really like the direction of this new logo. much more legible, overall a cleaner more professional logo. i am not quite sure if the variation in dot colors is working &ndash; it is so gradual that is not that noticable . . . it seems as though it would not be noticed unless the logo was quite large, etc. especially the dot in the &quot;p&quot; &ndash; it is hard to notice even when the logo is large.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The first logo is too cryptic, I agree with Sally, that it is very hard to read, especially for an untrained eye. The latest post is much more legible, but still takes a bit too much effort to read for the avarage person. Imagine this logo in use on say a delivery truck, driving at 40mph and people trying to read it in a busy street. Consider all uses from web, signage, catalogs, b/w, color reproduction, etc&hellip; and think about this from the userbility  <BR>aspect of the design versus the creative/artistic aspect. <BR>I did design for a similar type of client last year. Simplicity is  <BR>sometimes the best approach. Like all work it is important to consider end user/consumer instead of just delivering something client/company likes. You are in the business of solving communication issues and not an artist. Consider how this company would grow with the identity you create. Test it <BR>in black and white. small and large scale, blur it a bit to see how it would be recognized by someone with poor eyesight, dyslexia, etc&hellip;You can charge more money with this approach and make you business more profit, ands serve your client's needs better. <BR>As for what you have done so far. It is very nice and artistic and I personally like it, even though that really doesn't matter.</div>
