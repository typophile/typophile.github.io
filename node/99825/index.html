Actually there is such an article: http://www.rolandstroud.com/downloads/essays/courierfonts.pdf

My guess would be Courier New, which is a system font on Windows. <a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-12-06/tech/30481049_1_android-apps-ios">This article</a> from November 2011 gives a number of 1.25 billion Windows installations worldwide. Hard to beat that with any font ;)</div>

IBM did make a Selectric element with this modified face as well, but it was an exotic product that one would have to special order.

I have prepared an image, but while the Insert Image link lets me specify one, it apparently doesn't proceed to do the download, and it definitely doesn't provide a link to the image to include in my post.

		<div class="commentbody">John, Courier New is a system font on Mac OS X. It’s metrically identical to the Windows system font, but there are some differences in the character set coverage.

Courier New on Windows 7 has 3248 glyphs, expanded to 3458 on Windows 8.
Courier New on Mac OS X 10.6 – 10.8 has 3151 glyphs.

These are most of the encoded glyphs that are in the Windows 8, but not in the Mac version:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CourierNew-diff_5901.png]

The outlines are mostly also identical. MS and Apple seem to have started from the same version and added new glyphs independently.</div>

The Stroud article does not go into many typographical details, only practical details that writers would be concerned with.

		<div class="commentbody">Yesterday one more version of Courier was relased:

<em>Courier Prime,</em> designed by Alan Dague-Greene and available under the SIL Open Font License:

http://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/
http://johnaugust.com/2013/introducing-courier-prime

My only quibble with the text on the website is that it claims an advantage in favour of Courier over any other monospaced typeface with the same cpi count when it comes to screenplays:

<blockquote>Since the beginning, screenplays have been written in Courier. Its uniformity allows filmmakers to make handy comparisons and estimates, such as 1 page = 1 minute of screen time.</blockquote>

And I guess screenplays were typewritten before Courier was released ...

I haven't looked at the fonts themselves yet.

One thing I will say about Courier is, if you're gonna use it, no one really cares which one you use.

That classic scene from <em>American Psycho</em> comes to mind, where Christian Bale and his ‘friends’ discuss the type and stock of their business cards…
My guess is that scriptwriters sit around doing a similar thing: “How come you don’t use Courier Prime? Nobody is going to read your shit, man!” “Think again, I commissioned my own version from this type guy, and it’s dope. Producers love it.” Etc.</div>

It's a reliable <em>average</em> in the US film industry.* So allows for a quick initial judgement of how long a film is likely to be based on the number of pages in a script. Of course there will be variance for individual films, particular directors, etc., but it is a useful average. When I was writing for theatre and occasionally acting, we similarly reckoned about 1.5 minutes per page of script. People didn't pull these numbers out of a delusional nowhere: they noticed over time that these correlations were common, and hence provide a useful approximation.

* I'm guessing that Bollywood, for instance, has its own average, based on the formatting of its scripts and the languages and scripts used. </div>

It was clear to me  at the time of my revivals, that the letter gothic types were intended to be boys, making the girls even clearer. I mean it wasn't like they couldn't make sharp corners, they didn't always want them, and the types showed this clearly. 

"...then the divorce settlement would have likely been pretty impressive..."

I think each character got exactly the same amount in the final settlement. Her sister, a really nasty 12 pitch, wanted more, but that was another case.

"...anybody amateur enough to submit a script to a big studio that's way off in length..."

Hollywood movies have lengths related to their scripts' lenghts? So why should acceptance criteria be based on a script's page length? It just becomes a series, a sequel, a directors cut, or someone gets burned.

Or think Walter Burns! One minute could take five pages with all the people talking over each other, alternating with short staccato whitespace-wasting lines. And <em>2001:...</em> a four hour movie on a 20 page script was as Kubrick said, "...basically a visual, nonverbal experience" and that it "hits the viewer at an inner level of consciousness, just as music does, or painting", or a good Courier 10 pitch, I might add.</div>

They are not correct. Most versions with square serifs are based on versions derived via early postscript stroke fonts intent on conservation of point data vs authenticity. Corners like those in a true typewriter ? would have poked the ribbon and then the paper to shreds. 

The Bitstream versions of this and Prestige, available from Myfonts, are authentic, drawn from enlargements of actual IBM types.</div>

bbg, I'm curious about your comment where you say "most:"
"Most versions with square serifs are based on versions derived via early postscript stroke fonts . . ."

If most of them were derived of early postscript stroke fonts, I'm curious about any that were not (especially if they were based on actual typewriter type). I'm curious to find any Courier variant which is derived of (or inspired by) actual typewriter type heads, but which is modified to have sharp corners on serifs, stroke ends etc.

hrant, if I may ask . . . how is progress coming on the (Courier-related?) design which I presume you must be working on, based on a comment you made? :)

All,

I think a list of Courier variants would make a great TypeWiki page; OR it could be a section of a page on Courier. (And there isn't any page about Courier, as I write this!)

Here's my start, which does not include all pertinent information available to me . . . If I would be welcome to copy this as a page stub to TypeWiki, I'd be happy to--or I welcome anyone else to.

A question that arises: what "Typewriter" typefaces may <em>not</em> be derived of Courier (or certainly are not), yet resemble it? Where would METAFONT/Computer Modern fit in the list?

Reference; NOTE that most of these have lists (even quite long ones) which were not incorporated into the below list!

Wow, sorry I missed your question.

Funny, I had completely forgotten I made that font (and I seem to have lost my development sources). It must have been a two-hour affair. I therefore can't answer your question.

So I went and looked up my forgotten work. It could probably only be selectively usable for designs with a deliberate "malformed" look. Here it is, for the curious:

http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/average-mono

I do recall it was inspired by Averia, which fascinates me despite that I have no use for the result :) and I also remember trying to select the most disparate-appearing fonts among all those I blended.

Maybe it could form a reference background to inspire sketches of a new monospace font that is in some sense a stylistic blend or average of so many fonts. I don't plan on that.

I don't suppose it's easily possible hunt down and list all typewriter-ish monospace fonts. (Maybe some expensive reference sold to type designers has done so already, besides.) Obviously, I forsook the effort, although I still think it would make a fascinating wiki article.

hrant, have I missed any posts about your experiment?</div>
