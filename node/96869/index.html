<p>There do appear to be some differences in them, not withstanding the face that Linotype Univers and Univers Next offer a far greater number of weights than Univers, as well as the more desirable ampersand; the cut (so to speak) appears different.

No, no peculiar historical consideration - I suppose I&rsquo;m just being a little pedantic. I do prefer the ampersands of the Linotype and Next versions, and the cut feels a touch more elegant, but felt it was worth checking I wasn&rsquo;t flying in the face of popular typographic opinion.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the real questions are : considering that designers have for decades been using the “old” digital version, hasn’t this one become a classic in its own right ? Who can decide (Linotype ? Adrian Frutiger ?) that the “new” versions should be preferred ? And how can Linotype dare to pretend that they care about typographic quality when they have been selling for decades a version of Univers which presented “obvious flaws” (their words) — which the “new” version supposedly corrected ?</p>

<p>To talk about Linotype as a homogeneous entity is to ignore the incredibly talented group of designers and engineers that work there and care deeply about those differences and the importance of doing justice to a great typeface.

<p>Mmh… It hadn’t struck me that the work done by Willi Kunz for Columbia University School of Architecture with the “old” digital Univers, for instance, had suffered from an “absence of alternatives”.</p>
<p>I do agree with you, though, that the decision to use this or that version of ANY typeface is down to the users themselves — but I don’t want to underestimate the game of influences and PR played by large digital foundries towards the graphic design community either.</p>
<p>Finally, although I have the deepest respect for the creative people working at Linotype (the incredible Akira Kobayashi, for instance), Linotype DOES indeed present itself as a single entity (remember “Home of the Originals” ?) when dealing with the buying public. And this single entity has for years positioned itself as a haven of good typographic design while, at the same time, marketing and selling fonts that were simply not up to par.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Indeed it is because I wouldn’t consider Comic Sans (or Papyrus, for that matter) as “classics” that I took care to narrow my argument to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(professional) graphic design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> uses — as a graphic design teacher and critic, I’m particularly interested in how graphic designers (this strange tribe) envision the typographic tools they use, how they choose them, how their perception of them is informed (and by what factors). I’m deeply convinced, for instance, that certain historic, iconic and/or high-profile <!-- raw HTML omitted --> professional<!-- raw HTML omitted --> uses of certain typefaces have made them classics <!-- raw HTML omitted -->within the graphic design canon<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The problem I have with the latest digital versions of Univers is that they significantly differ from the one which, by virtue of its use by the likes of Willi Kunz, Angus Hyland (the “Pocket Canons” series) or Werner Jeker (and all the designers who ever worked for the Kieler Woche during the past 25 years), has become a point of reference within the collective culture of graphic design professionals. In this respect, the fact that these “new and improved” versions are supposedly closer to Adrian Frutiger’s original drawings from 1954-1957 seems irrelevant to me and doesn’t make them more vital (desirable, compulsory, etc.) than the “old” digital version.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>While Adrian Fruitger&rsquo;s original drawings aren&rsquo;t a point of reference for the ultimate readers of books or advertisements, I can indeed see people rejecting, at least in the case of Times Roman, the current digital version, as opposed to the versions by Linotype and Monotype in the hot metal era, as the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; that people recognize.</p>
<p>That the same might be true of Univers, leading to a conclusion that digital type is still in its infancy, and lacks subtle qualities of grace and beauty - or some other characteristic - generally present in the hot metal era does not strike me as wildly improbable.</p>
<p>The good news is that there&rsquo;s every chance this lack has the potential to become a &ldquo;recognized quality&rdquo; - there&rsquo;s no royal road to designing better types, but this could be something any competent type designer could learn not to overlook. (Or it could require cooperation from others, such as adding other types of curve instead of just Bézier curves to the font technology.)</p>

I agree with you that there could indeed be a consensus amongst <!-- raw HTML omitted -->type designers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the “old” digital version of Univers is inferior to the original metal versions (foundry type, Linotype or Monotype hot-metal) ; it doesn’t make it less iconic in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->graphic design<!-- raw HTML omitted --> culture (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->i. e.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> end-user culture), on account of the “quite-recent-but-already-classic” works I listed in my previous comments (all these works were indeed done with the “old” digital version). 
Please bear in mind that I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->didn’t<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mention iconic works (by Armin Hofmann, Emil Ruder, etc.) using the original metal Univers — these works can’t be emulated anyway since the typographical material and technology they used are no longer with us.</div>

I mean : How can they dare to want to make money <!-- raw HTML omitted -->at all costs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, even if it means disregarding the overall logic and integrity of the original Univers design ? The fact that the “old” digital version had its (numerous) flaws is in contradiction with Linotype’s repeated claims that they had the utmost respect for Adrian Frutiger’s work — but it hasn’t prevented this very same version to become an important part of contemporary graphic design culture.</div>

<p>Part of the motivation for asking my original question was an admiration for Otl Aicher&rsquo;s use of Univers in his Munich &lsquo;72 work (which is on display in the café in London&rsquo;s Design Museum, by the way!), way before any digitized versions were to appear, and in my opinion, much more attractive than the first digital version of Univers.</p>
<p>Just a side point: I said in my original question that Linotype Univers 430 seems heavier than Univers 55. I meant the opposite. LT Univers 430 seems lighter. Just thought I&rsquo;d correct myself.</p>

The Munich &lsquo;72 display is part of the &lsquo;Designed to win&rsquo; exhibition showing until the 18th November.
There are only a limited number of Aicher&rsquo;s posters in the café. 6, I think. I don&rsquo;t know how many are in the exhibition, as I haven&rsquo;t attended it yet. Soon though&hellip;</li>

Thank you for the tip about the Design Museum ; do you know how long will this display last ?
About the Munich Olympics : I don’t know if they used the metal or photocomposition version (you’ll probably have to ask Ian McLaren, who was on Aicher’s team at the time, for that).</p>
<p>— Hrant
I can assure you I have no fetish for the “old” digital Univers ; I just have serious qualms about PR doublespeak when it comes to cultural artefacts such as typefaces.</p>

It’s always hard to get back in the zone.
In some cases, I think the new version is better than the old.
In others, not really.
As we often say in matters of type, it depends…
Anyway, it doesn’t matter what the designer thinks, our taste and opinions are not the same as those of type users, even when we like the same thing, which can be for quite different reasons.</div>

Do you think that when Linotype and Frutiger redrew Univers in &lsquo;97 (for Linotype Univers), they didn&rsquo;t do as good a job as they could have done? (possibly due to Frutigers age?)</p>
<p>-Nick
I think that authenticity is an important consideration when dealing with type, especially when we&rsquo;re dealing with typefaces that have made the transition from hot metal, etc. to digital. When I buy fonts, I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;m getting what the type designer intended, rather than a compromise solution. I concede though that this could reach the level of pedantry, and that it&rsquo;s perfectly possible that an historically inaccurate reversion could be as beautiful. I dare say I prefer Bach on modern instruments.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s nice. Really. But do note that type designers compromise &ldquo;internally&rdquo; as well. And quite often a type designer can greatly refine his work thanks to guidance from a font house.</p>

A valuable source for Adrian Frutiger’s opinions about his own typefaces (in their past and current versions) is this book [[http://www.amazon.com/Adrian-Frutiger-Typefaces-Complete-Works/dp/3764385812/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349333810&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Frutiger]] (everything you ever wanted to know about Frutiger’s typographic designs, including the bits you never cared about). But maybe Bert knows about other sources.</p>

<p>— Hrant
Univers was originally designed for the Lumitype phototypesetting system (which Deberny &amp; Peignot had financed), which could easily accomodate the 16° slope. Things got tricky when the rights were sold to other foundries or manufacturers of typesetting equipment with different technical limits : the slope was changed to 12° to make Univers available on Linotype’s Linofilm machine, for instance.</p>

BTW: The original digital Sabon was terrible.</p>
<p>@Chris: I have to change my evaluation: AF was talking about the 1994 edition by Linotype, called Linotype Univers — he remarks upon that in the book Celeste mentions (page 102-103, English-language edition): “The new Linotype Univers is, on the whole, better than most other version […].” *
In contemporary marketing material for the launch of the Next version it is stated that its design is based on the original drawings by AF, as on the Linotype website: <a href="http://www.linotype.com/1813-15545/whyanewunivers.html">http://www.linotype.com/1813-15545/whyanewunivers.html</a> : “By following Frutiger’s original designs, the humanist character of the sanserif Univers now comes through more distinctly.”</p>
<p>(* In the same part of the book AF states that the best Univers remains the hot metal cast by Deberny &amp; Peignot (p. 97).)</p>

The limitations introduced by duplexed Linotype matrices were indeed integral parts of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->design program<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for numerous historically important 20th-century typefaces (all the newspaper faces designed under Chauncey H.

Don’t try to ask digital typefaces for Christmas or birthday gifts — people will look at you funny. I know it, I’ve tried it once — “What do you mean, you’d like FF Legato as a present for your 35th birthday ?” (yelled my mother in disbelief).</p>

<p>If the digital revival matched the metrics of the metal original simply so that people could recreate matching compositions, that&rsquo;s not bad; but if it did that out of laziness or incompetence or simply due to a misplaced reverence for a technically handicapped design (a handicap that no longer makes sense), that sucks.</p>

It is quite correct that Sabon was subject to technical constraints.</p>
<p>It was constrained to meet the lowest common denominator of Linotype and Monotype. So the italics were spaced exactly the same as the Roman (as Linotype required) and the letters were all constrained to have widths belonging to the Monotype 18-unit system.</p>
<p>These constraints set limits to the design, and doubtless they did impair the aesthetic quality of the result - at least <!-- raw HTML omitted -->slightly<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>But when you ask why a digital revival of Sabon should have the same metrics&hellip; then, despite agreeing with you up to this point in principle, I part company.</p>
<p>Given that Jan Tschichold did a good job of preventing Sabon&rsquo;s aesthetic qualities from being too gravely impaired by these constraints, do you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> think that a net improvement is the most likely result of some newbie font designer at Adobe being given a free hand to change the metrics and the design as he sees fit?</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t necessarily reverence for the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->technical constraints<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Sabon that leads people to consider, based on the principle that a good typeface is a beautiful set of letters, and not a set of beautiful letters, that Jan Tschichold&rsquo;s work of making all the letters in the typeface into a harmonious whole ought not to be tossed out the window in hopes that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a different type designer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, now working under fewer constraints, could produce a better result than he did.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t the constraints we want to keep: it&rsquo;s Jan Tschichold&rsquo;s artistic touch and vision in the final phase of integrating the typeface we want to keep, and we despair of preserving that while throwing away the constraints.</p>

I’ll try to make myself clear in spite of my struggling English writing — so please be clement.</p>
<p>Technical constraints are not arbitrary when they’re part of a design brief — from a design point of view (not limited to typeface design — think furniture, architecture, etc.), a solution which meets <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the requirements of the brief can hardly be bettered (although it can be equaled) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->within the same parameters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> If you remove the technical constraints, you also change the brief, and you end up with a completely new design – which I think cannot be compared fairly with the “old” one, because it exists on a whole different plane.</p>
<p>Now, about Sabon : Tschichold himself didn’t think that Sabon had been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->handicapped<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by the technical constraints imposed by the Linotype and Monotype typecasting systems — on the contrary, he was proud (and rightly so, in my opinion) of the way he had met these particular requirements of the original design brief. Respecting this singular design solution’s integrity is not “misplaced reverence” — you’re absolutely entitled to design another sixteenth-century-inspired text typeface <!-- raw HTML omitted -->within contemporary technical parameters<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (and that’s precisely what Jean-François Porchez did with Sabon Next), it will simply not be Sabon anymore.</p>

&ldquo;New and improved&rdquo; is a wonderful term for the marketeer, because it offers the promise of a better product, without necessarily providing criteria for how the claim may be proved (well, with regard to &ldquo;improved&rdquo; anyway). To be fair to Linotype, they did provide such a criteria in their rationale for a new Univers. (Here&hellip; <a href="http://www.linotype.com/1813-15545/whyanewunivers.html">http://www.linotype.com/1813-15545/whyanewunivers.html</a> ) Which, on the face of it, seems to be to provide more weights, with careful attention paid to how the weights relate to each other, and also to redraw all the weights for &ldquo;&hellip;improved legibility and on-screen application.&rdquo; Also implicit in their documentation is to make Linotype Univers follow Frutiger&rsquo;s original designs more closely.</p>
<p>By these criteria, they seem to have had some success. There certainly are more weights (!), and there are features of Frutiger&rsquo;s original designs which made a comeback, such as the numerals, the ampersand and the increased angle of the oblique.</p>
<p>But could you call it &lsquo;better&rsquo;? More to the point, would Linotype? It seems they wouldn&rsquo;t go that far. The interview between Frutiger and Friedrich Friedl here&hellip; <a href="http://www.linotype.com/1813-15552/podiumdiscussionuniversisaclassicaltypeface.html">http://www.linotype.com/1813-15552/podiumdiscussionuniversisaclassicaltypeface.html</a> has Friedl calling the &lsquo;old&rsquo; (he means the original, 1957 version) Univers &lsquo;perfect&rsquo;. With Linotype Univers, they &ldquo;took it further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, it is remarkably easy, when dealing with twentieth century typefaces like Univers or , to ask which is &lsquo;better&rsquo;, as I did in my original question. I&rsquo;m not sure we would measure the various cuts of Garamond against each other in quite the same way. I see that, like dealing with typefaces such as Garamond or Bodoni, it&rsquo;s not quite so simple as that.</p>

<p>So while I don&rsquo;t think that designers of new typefaces inspired by Sabon should adopt its technical constraints, as that would be gratuitous, a digital version of Sabon itself should be faithful to it, and provide its users with Jan Tschichold&rsquo;s work, faithfully copied over, not someone else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>New type designers will in some cases have something worthwhile to say - sacrificing old typefaces to get new ones, though, would be a losing gamble. Of new typefaces, only a few survive.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>— David
When a big, ancient, well-respected, reputable, dignified type manufacturer rolls out its marketing steamroller (as Linotype did with the launching of every typeface included in their Platinum Collection), it’s very hard for the average customer to resist the suggestion that he should discard the “old” version of a typeface to adopt the “new and improved” one. Especially when the argument comes loaded with endorsements from the original designer (if still available) and/or various luminaries from the type and graphic design communities.</p>
<p>Could the fact that you call these <!-- raw HTML omitted -->original<!-- raw HTML omitted --> versions “Alternative” be interpreted as a symptom of an interesting perceptual shift ? The “new and improved” versions <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the (sometimes welcome) “alternatives”, not the other way round…</p>
<p>By the way, the only reason these “old” versions don’t usually disappear from the typefoundries’ catalogues is that they can still contribute to make these very catalogues look thicker and richer (also a marketing ploy, by the way).</p>

<p>Not so.
In digital type culture, there is no difference between the warehouse, the musem*, and the supermarket.
As long as there is a part of the long tail market that still wants the “old and unimproved” (i.e. “Classic”), product/artefact, the vast majority of foundries will not remove it from their shelves/displays.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s your choice, and few if any ancient or modern false claims, are breaking your arm. If resistance is futile, I suggest it&rsquo;s your opportunity to vote with your pocketbook on design and not Linotype&rsquo;s rapacious greed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the only reason “old” versions don’t usually disappear from the typefoundries’ catalogues is that they can still contribute to make these very catalogues look thicker and richer (also a marketing ploy, by&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I agree that catalog thickening occurs with more versions of families, digital distribution thins this to a great extent to the thickness of your screen, and I&rsquo;m not entirely certain the marketing department likes more versions, in print or on screen, as much as they like more families, and versions addressing specific typographic rather than generational uses, not to denigrate the latter in any way. But the bottom line for any sane marketeer, says the average user most likely prefers one version.</p>
<p>I might also suggest, though I am not at liberty to detail, that there are other more important marketing issues involving the profit margins, that keep multi-versioning going in many foundries, and though I know nothing of Linotype&rsquo;s details, this is an important aspect of some font marketing.</p>
<p>You, may have the last word, and I thank you for your opinions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You are asking for the real Univers. 
let me give you a few insights on this. 
Univers was a face that was originally made for hotmetal at Deberny &amp; Peignot. It had this 16 degrees slanted italic. 
This was at Linotype for the matrices of the hotmetal machines not possible. Therefore the type needed a lesser slant angle 11 degrees. You know the regular (55) and the italic (56) were needed on one matrice, meant they had to share the same width. The same was necessary for the bold (75) which was on the same width like the regular (55).<br>
There was also another thing that I did not understand in the beginning of my career at Stempel and Linotype. Why does the hotmetal version has such a nice et-sign and why is this dump &amp;-sign in the fonts. 
Clear answer, that was based on customer requests from the US, they are used to the &amp; sign form and could not understand what the et-ligature from Frutigers Univers mean.
And therefore the fonts have this sign included. In the new versions we have the new sign, but again some US customers complained&hellip;..</p>
<p>These fonts than needed to be compatible with our phototypesetting machines, as our former customers did not wanted to let their customers identify in print whether it was hotmetal or phototype. It needed to be width compatible. 
This we migrated through all our technologies until the Linotype Laserfonts. The only difference we made was that the italics were really drawn as italics. You know the differences between a slanted font and an italic form.
When Linotype entered into the production with Adobe to make the Postscript library Univers was one of the first fonts and Linotype at that time did not yet had the Adobe tools to make our own digitization. So we supplied Adobe with digital data and they made the conversion into PS fonts. For italic it was at that early stage of the development the habit to just make set a slant angle into the fonts and you have an italic. which was than called oblique. Therefore Univers 55 oblique and not 56 Italic.</p>
<p>Whan Adrian saw the digitization he was not pleased, but it was nearly similar to the Linotype version which was this mechanic restricted version. so this was transitioned into this technology. 
In 1996 Gerards Unger was approaching Bruno Steinert (our former MD) and me at the AtypI and explained ushis philosophy that we should extend our classic faces and do a similar work like with neue Helvetica and revise the Univers family to a more consistant family.
We approached Frutiger with that idea and he at that time just recovered from a heart surgery with three bypasses and he was pleased that Linotype took up this idea to make a new version of the Univers family. At that time he was completely clear in his head and he was working hard on this project with our former type director Reinhard Haus. The beginning was a trial to look if we could use the exisiting data and refine just a few errors in the outllines, but we realized that this was not leading to the right result. So we scraped all this work and restarted by looking at the original prints form the hotmetal Univers. But there as you can imagine were also resulting inconsistancies in the family and weights that Adrian used the prints and used his scissors to cut and shape the letters into a form the was for his eyes pleasing.
So the Linotype Univers family was developed. It was the beginning of our Platinum Collection to which Gerard Unger was the originator.
More you can read at our website 
<a href="http://www.linotype.com/de/6933/linotypeunivers.html">http://www.linotype.com/de/6933/linotypeunivers.html</a>
There was one thing left over for many years. (the family should get small caps) and this gap was filled a few years ago and we detected that the naming of the font was not as good like all the other products form the Platinum Collection used nova or Next. And therefore we renamed the complete family into Univers Next and added the small caps to the fonts. Nothing else had been changed.

<p>I realize that the Univers for the Selectric Composer was an official adaptation.</p>
<p>Even so, because the spacing used for the machine was close to ideal for Times Roman, thus making their imitation, Press Roman, successful, the sans-serif faces such as Univers and Theme left too much space around the lowercase i and l, for example.</p>
<p>Still, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the face doesn&rsquo;t contain useful information about how Fruitger intended Univers to look - and how to modify it to respond to constraints. So I approve of studying it, but I can&rsquo;t consider it worthy of revival.</p>

<p>The typesetting of <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Last Whole Earth Catalogue<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (the bible of the Counterculture) was done with Selectrix.

<p>Otmar, thanks so much for your inside knowledge on Univers. It certainly does help clear up some of the mysteries of the &lsquo;old&rsquo; digital Univers, such as the ampersand. How could anybody complain about Frutiger&rsquo;s lovely &lsquo;Et&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s one of my favourite features of Univers, and a reasons why I regret having purchased a few weights of the old version.</p>
<p>As an employee of Linotype, I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;ll feel inclined to answer the following, but I&rsquo;ll ask it in case you do (indeed, if anyone has any insights on this)&hellip;</p>
<p>What was the deal with Berthold Univers' disappearance from the marketplace? I believe it was a favourite of some Univers officianados (such I Willi Kunz, I think). I know there was some kind of legal dispute, but I wondered why Bitstream still sell Univers (albeit by another name - Zurich), yet Berthold has withdrawn it&rsquo;s offering. Anyway, thought I&rsquo;d put that out there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Incidentally, the Selectric Composer provides an illustrative example of how a variety of typeface designs fare when subjected to a similar (but more severe) set of constraints than those to which Sabon was  subject.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type elements contained only 88 characters, and so the same unit system applied to Roman, Italic, and Bold weights of every typeface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device employed a 9-unit system. However, this was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> twice as coarse as the Monotype 18-unit system; instead, most letters were assigned widths comparable to those used for Times Roman, scaled down from 18 units to the em to 11 units to the em.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, the letters m, M, and W were narrower than they should have been to be in the correct proportion, being 9 units wide rather than 11, in order to fit on the type element (it being desired to support type sizes up to 11 points, and to use the same basic type element as used in normal Selectric typewriters).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I just thought it would be worth citing this example in this thread, as comparing Press Roman to Times Roman, and so on, might give a benchmark for the potential impact of technical constraints on Sabon, and how well Jan Tschichold did in overcoming them.</p>
