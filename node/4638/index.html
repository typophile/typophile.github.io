  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For those that are interested, a 15 minute programme about the work of Margaret Calvert and the designs for contemporary UK traffic signs. <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0>&lt;!-quote-!&gt;<b>quote:</b><p>Routemasters 1/5. The Blue and the Green. <BR> <BR>A five-part celebration of some of our most familiar, but unrecognised design classics: the road sign, the white line, the roundabout, the green man and the traffic calmer. Some are regarded as international design classics, others bemuse overseas visitors as eccentric. But as Joe Kerr finds out behind them lie forgotten histories, and fifty years of combined brainpower from typographers, psychologists, engineers and ordinary members of the public. <BR> <BR>In the first programme, Joe meets the woman who was one half of the partnership who in the 1960s came up with the distinctive look of British road signs. Today they are heralded as a triumph of design. And if you've ever wondered who drew the pictures on our signs - this programme reveals all.&lt;!-/quote-!&gt;<hr size=0></blockquote> <BR>It is on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/" target="_blank">BBC Radio 4</a> at 09:30 Tuesday 11 May. <BR> <BR>It might only be on for 15 minutes, but it is just the sort of thing the BBC does very well. <BR> <BR>I see that Ole Lund will be presenting about <a href="http://www.atypi.org/08_Prague/30_program/20_main_program/view_presentation_html?presentid=86" target="_blank">Kinneir and Calvert</a> at ATypI. <BR> <BR>The official current legislation, with illustrations (towards the bottom of the page), can be found <a href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/si/si2002/20023113.htm" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody">While UK traffic signage is ok on main routes, its a shame that over zealous bureaucrats have tried to root out all of the old style signs, even on the quietest backroads.  <BR>The older signs had far more character, exhibited regional variation and were perfectly adequate for the needs of smaller roads. <BR>There are still some of the old type left, but don't tell the MoT (sorry, the Highways Agency) or they too will be replaced by characterless reflective plastic. <BR>(In the very unlikely event that anyone cares, I've got a 1954 Highway Code booklet, so I could upload some scans to illustrate the difference). <BR> <BR>(As if it wasn't bad enough that so many red phone boxes were replaced by the aluminium &amp; plastic things which seem to have been designed specifically to prevent anyone making a phone call in them). <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well I thought it was a very interesting little programme, not technical, but entertaining. Anyone interested can catch it again <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/rams/tue0930.ram" target="_blank">here</a> <BR> <BR>I know where you're coming from Steve. On an aeshetic level, I don't like much of it (personally I think Transport is quite unpleasant) but I believe that it does work very well as an entire scheme. <BR> <BR>I would be interested to see some scans of your 1954 Highway Code.</div>
