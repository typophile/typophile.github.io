  only remember negative comments from type setters regarding Helvetica's readability

  so much alike. This feature was usually regarded as suitable for logos, not for
  continuous text. Does it work better for longer texts on screen than in print?\r\n\r\nIs
  there a font that would be more suitable for either one of the two iPhone screens

  an older iPhone screen)? Has anyone experimented with readability on the devices?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your opinion and avice!"

    In fact, it works badly even for very short amounts of text at small sizes. Let
    us say for example that you want to read an address off the screen. The high confusability
    of the numbers 3689 is a real problem.\r\n\r\n> Is there a font that would be
    more suitable for either one of the two iPhone screens than Helvetica/Helvetica
    Neue? \r\n\r\nThere are many such fonts. You could pick nearly any humanist sans,
    including Lucida Sans / Lucida Grande (one of Apple's system fonts), or Myriad
    (Apple's corporate identity typeface). At lower resolution such as the older iPhones
    (pre-Retina) having vertically/horizontally cut terminals or close to it would
    be a bonus, so something more like Segoe (Microsoft's UI typeface) or Frutiger
    might be best. Heck, my own Hypatia Sans would be an improvement over Helvetica.\r\n\r\n>
    Has anyone experimented with readability on the devices?\r\n\r\nYes, I spend about
    8 hours messing with it after I jailbroke my iPhone 3G (which I did primarily
    for this reason), and will probably jailbreak my iPhone 4 primarily because of
    this issue.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    a comparison with a screen mockup in Ps and put it on an iPod 3G, one time using
    Helvetica and one time Frutiger.\r\n\r\nWhile the letter shapes and the resulting
    words are a lot more distinct with Frutiger, the counters become a bit too small
    and a bit too blurry since the letters don't fit the pixel grid as well as the
    fency Helvetica. I'll try some more."

    think you are asking for the right attributes. Verdana, Apres RE, Antenna RE Benton

    sans serifs, even at these sizes/resolutions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
