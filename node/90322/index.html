  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This is a somewhat absurdly OCD question, but I figure I&rsquo;ve come to the right place to ask about fonts; I initially posed this question in a guitar forum &amp; got nowhere:
Beginning in &lsquo;74, Pete Townsend of The Who numbered his Les Pauls (guitars) 1-9 for different tunings etc. Between songs he would take them off &amp; literally throw the guitar to a roadie- I remember being very impressed by all this business with the numbered guitars when I saw them in the mid-&rsquo;70s. What font was he (or his guitar tech) using?
See here as I can&rsquo;t seem to get the img tag to work:
[[http://www.feelnumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/76_ptbackstage-tuning1.jpg]]
I was thinking about putting a number on a Les Paul I just got, but can&rsquo;t find the right font among the bazillions on my Mac or with an online search. 
It&rsquo;s very close to the London Underground font aka P22 Johnston in bold variants, but the &ldquo;8&rdquo; among others is off.
Can anyone tell me the right font?
One clue would be whatever fonts were available in Presstype rub-on lettering in 1974 (or, more likely, some UK equivalent I&rsquo;ve never heard of), as I&rsquo;d bet that was what was used to number the guitars.
Many thanx for any help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the replies; the guitar guys came through with the fact (from a/the Who site) that they are Letraset numbers (so I was right about a UK equivalent of Presstype, although one I used a lot in the &rsquo;70s, but had forgotten- this probably explains the maddening familiarity of the font).
Letraset&rsquo;s closest current font is Charlotte Book Sans, which is close but no cigar, perhaps because the site says it was done in 1992 &amp; thus unlikely to have been very available in 1974.
eliason: yes, very close &amp; likely you are correct that the designer is &ldquo;biting&rdquo; (as we used to say when we did calligraphy on the MTA) what I&rsquo;m looking for (as is the current Letraset font, which in any case doesn&rsquo;t come in the white 5&quot; high numerals needed).
One of the guitar guys blew up a pic of one of Townsend&rsquo;s guitars to lifesize &amp; traced the number to make one for his guitar, so you can see I&rsquo;m not [entirely] alone in my OCD-ness.,</div>
