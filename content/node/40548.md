body: "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nLooking for a new font with the following specs to use for
  a Cleint logotype:\r\n\r\nThe specs are as follows:\r\n\r\na) Must be a lowercase
  sans-serif font\r\nb) contemporary\r\nc) similar in look to Frutiger font\r\nd)
  some distinctive element (maybe in the ascenders/descenders etc)\r\n\r\nAny help??\r\n\r\nI
  guess as a designer i have exhausted my ability to look at fonts as for the past
  4 days i have been going through FontFont,Emigre,Adobe and Linotype sets....so i
  a bit saturated..\r\nI was thinking dax or interstate but have overused those altogether
  so quite keen on something new!\r\n\r\nseeming you all are so good with your opinions
  and feedback was hoping maybe some of you could make suggestions to fonts for this
  purpose\r\n\r\nLinks to samples and sites for purchase also appreciarted!!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nRobby\r\n\r\n\r\n"
