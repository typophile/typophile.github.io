  body: 'I''m assuming that no-one is replying because this looks like some kind of
    joke.  It isn''t; the only joke here is my comical lack of font identification
    skills.  Just can''t seem to find it.  I know it''s an easy one.  whatthefont
    isn''t working right because the image is too pixelated.  I''m just that bad at
    this.  Please help.  '

  body: Looks to me like someone lopped the serifs off of Times Roman, made a few
    other modifications, and slanted it. No idea what it's called or where it's from,
    though. Maybe custom.
