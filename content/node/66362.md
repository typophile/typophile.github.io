  to be a lake escape for wealthy people. The title of the newsletter is \"The Porch
  and Breeze,\" and the name lets you know mostly everything they're going for in
  the look and feel.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards Garamond for the body text, but I
  think the headers will really be setting the mood of the piece. I've considered
  Mrs. Eaves and Feijoa, but I wanted to hear any other suggestion you kind folks
  might have for a face that harkens \"the good ole days\" without being kitschy.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

  body: "@Satyagraha Sorry for my oversight there, Adobe Garamond Pro is the only
    one I own, and I was leaning this way for its more spacious and open feel than
    its Adobe Caslon or Adobe Jenson friends.\r\n\r\nOpen to other suggestions, although
    we'll certainly be cutting it deep if I end up buying a face for the headers and
    a new face for the body.\r\n\r\n@oldnick I like it! Perhaps a bit to narrow for
    the application here, going to try and be thorough in using various weights. I
    didn't mention that I'll also likely be setting the paper's title in the same
    face. (I hesitate to call it a logo.) I'm going to play with it some more though;
    it's certainly evocative.\r\n\r\n@pcarter Very interested in the luxury family.
    I'd never seen that one from House before; looking deeper into it; thanks so much!"

    for the time being. Waiting on project approval to buy the real thing, as I don't
    own them yet. \r\n\r\nPalatine, do you simply suggest turning hyphenation back
    on? Ragged right?\r\n\r\nI think I should work a border into this as well to help
    the whitespace feel like it doesn't go on forever off the edge of the page.\r\n\r\nI'm
    trying to train my eye better with type, and it's definitely slow learning. What
    I'm seeing is that in the main title, P-o is loose, c-h is tight, S-c is loose
    and c-r-e is tight. Does it seem like I've got the hang of at least that part?\r\n\r\nThanks
    so much for your suggestions and patience with me on this. Certainly not classically-trained,
    and just looking to teach myself as best possible. Folks like you guys make it
    possible, and I really appreciate it."
