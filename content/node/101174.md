  this Opentype feature? I've been searching for info about this but I cannot seem
  to find anything conclusive. I've been looking at the way some fonts implement this
  feature and it seems to differ one from another; some substitute entire classes
  while other just seem to substitute in a glyph by glyph fashion. What is the way
  to go?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

  body: Disregard this question. I checked the sample font included in FL (as suggested
    in another thread) and I think I nailed it.
