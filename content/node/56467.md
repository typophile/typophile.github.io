  and I have seen some of their work so was pleasantly surprised to find this gem
  by coincedence while looking at design sites insdie of studying for a test tomorrow....\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sarahaking.com/\r\n\r\nFrom
  her \"About\" page, Sarah seems to be a freelance illustrator, but I like her handdrawn
  type and how she uses it entirely to create an image rather than relying on finding
  something to accompany it....plus, she interned for mike perry who i love love love!!\r\n"
