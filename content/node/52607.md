body: "I made a modular display typeface in 2003. Based in a 3*7 grid. I retooled
  it a bit in 2008 with much more characters and several corrections. I like it and
  people have said me that I can sell it at a local foundry, but I'm afraid because
  it look too similar (although not exactly the same) to the [[http://www.fonts.info/info/en_iwan-reschniev.htm|Ivan
  Reschniev]] font and some logotipes, but I wasn't aware of those at first.\r\nRespective
  specimens attached. The last one has latin-1 mostly and a few corrections."

  body: I like that a lot, and I don't think it is too similar to Ivan Reshniev. Upper
    and lower case c are an obvious difference.

  body: Somehow I feel it would be improved if you shortened the top end of the "a"
    by half a block.

    http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T1939 It has a few differences from
    the one I posted. The main one is the new shape of the "dots".'
