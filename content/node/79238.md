body: "We have just embarked on a complete overhaul of the magazine style for Waypoint
  AirMed&Rescue. We are seeking advice on the best way to pair up a sans and a serifed
  font.\r\n\r\nSo far we have chosen Zapf Elliptical and Williams Caslon Text as the
  main contenders for the main article body text. We would like to use a modern sans
  face for the features to create contrast between the standard articles and the featured
  articles.\r\n\r\nWe're not necessarily looking for suggestions on what to use, but
  are simply looking for advice on the theory behind combining (and creating contrast
  between) sans and serifed typefaces within magazine body copy.\r\n\r\nThe current
  style consists of Adobe Garamond Pro Regular (9.5pt / 11.3pt) and Humanist 521 Light
  (9pt / 11.3pt) to give you an idea of the contrast we're looking for.\r\n\r\nAny
  advice would be appreciated."
