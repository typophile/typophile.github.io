  no automatic font ID website (What the Font, etc.) seems to be able to name it.
  I'm guessing it's maybe custom made ? Still, if anyone here could recognize it,
  it would help me a lot.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time !\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_4428.jpg]"

  body: "WhatTheFont, even when you give it a pristine sample, doesn't accurately
    identify everything--including fonts it sells.\r\n\r\nThe type in your sample
    is far smaller than the optimum 100 px tall, and fairly low-res. I enlarged the
    JPG you uploaded, but it is still quite indisctinct, and I'm getting multiple
    matches that are all very close to one another. Here are two likely candidates.\r\n\r\nVera
    Sans:\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bitstream-vera-sans\r\n\r\nPrima Sans:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/prima-sans/\r\n\r\nIf
    the sample is from a website, please provide the URL--if the type is live, I can
    tell you exactly what it is.\r\n"

    looks like a more likely candidate than my two suggestions...."
