    target="_blank"> Art Deco sans serifs</a> at MyFonts,  <BR>and not in Rookledge&#39;s
    nor the FontBook neither.

  body: well, I suppose it&#39;s a custom made font then. <BR>I had checked the Fontbook
    too, asked around and was pointed to this forum. When I saw Mr Coles&#39; and
    your name as moderators, I thought I&#39;d surely get an answer here. <BR> <BR>Yves,
    little question... <BR>is there a reason why you changed the subjectname? &#40;Did
    I use characters that aren&#39;t allowed?&#41; Just so I don&#39;t make the same
    mistake in future posts. Thanks.

  body: '<i>&#62; is there a reason why you changed the subjectname?</i> <BR> <BR>Nah,
    it&#39;s purely practical: that way I can identify  <BR>specific threads without
    having to open them. This  <BR>allows me to work faster. Your naming was already  <BR>pretty
    clear, but sometimes we&#39;ve got half a dozen  <BR>of threads saying <i>&#34;Please
    help me to identify this  <BR>font&#34;</i>, which is not very practical &#40;and
    quite redundant  <BR>for posts on this board: it&#39;s not like we&#39;re swapping  <BR>recipes
    here&#41;. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    <BR> <BR>Stephen I understand, but I haven&#39;t quite made a name  <BR>for myself
    outside this board. What do you mean? <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 1. I was confused at first, I thought you removed my question as I couldn&#39;t
    find it anymore. Luckily I started going through the list before flaming away.
    <BR> <BR>2. well, we kinda met years ago, at the A-Type1 conference in Antwerp
    &#40;93? 94?&#41;. I pretty much spent the whole weekend in the Typelab there.
    Mario Beernaert &#40;remember TV27&#41; got me there, with a couple of other students.
    I don&#39;t think I really spoke to you back then, apart from maybe asking the
    odd Fontographer question or some printer problem. ;-&#41; <BR>As a customer of
    FS Belgium and reader of various FS publications, I obviously recognised your
    name when I saw it here. <BR> <BR>voila. da&#39;s ook weer opgelost dan...  <BR>

    to remove  <BR>your post. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
    border=0> <BR> <BR><i>&#62; Mario Beernaert &#40;remember TV27&#41;</i> <BR>Of
    course I remember Mario. Cloaca Maxima was one of  <BR>the good things happening
    those days, and I was <i>very</i>  <BR>pleased he won the FUSE Contest. I was
    less happy  <BR>with the outcome of the FontFont Contest though...
