body: "I have been seized with the urge to see how complete I can make my tiny pixel
  font, Fourmat. So I took on Cyrillic, knowing next to nothing about Cyrillic, but
  figuring that with such limited choices, there couldn't be too much to do wrong.
  Can someone more familiar with these languages tell me how it turned out? In particular
  I wonder if my unusual rendering of capital \u0424 is valid and if \u042D and \u0417
  are sufficiently disambiguated. Here is a double-size image with pangrams in Russian,
  Ukrainian, and Bulgarian, and part of a Pravda article."

  body: "To me it seems that at least the \u041B is too wide and perhaps \u041F, \u0426
    and \u040F. The forms for \u044D and \u0454 seem particularly strange. The \u0424
    could benefit from the bar extending above and below the bowl by 1 pixel."

  body: "If I were to narrow \u0426 and \u040F but leave \u041F as it is, would this
    be sensible or just inconsistent?"
