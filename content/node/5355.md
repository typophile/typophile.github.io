  my own ligatures for the company name.  The company name is 9 letters long. <BR>
  <BR>My question is: On average how long does it take to design 9 ligatures? <BR>
  <BR>I don&#39;t have the time frame to spend too much time doing this, but I feel
  this undetaking could prove  <BR>to be a great result. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions
  would be appreciated.'

  body: 'Wait a minute, either my Math is off our yours: Nine letters do not work
    out as nine separate ligatures, more like four and a half. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Ideally
    you should probably strive to end up with a lot less ligatures than that, that
    is unless you don&#39;t need the mark to be legible at all. Ligatures are neither
    always appropriate nor possible, as certain letter combinations resist attempts
    at &#40;&#42;ahem&#42;&#41; ligaturization in a most stubborn manner. Maybe you
    could single out one or two interesting letter combinations in your mark and see
    how you go. <BR> <BR>Anyway, if you really do feel your idea could end up producing
    a great result, then don&#39;t waste time: get to it <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    I was thinking of creating <BR>9 new LETTERS &#40;which consists of the company

    ambitious? Too much time? Or <BR>just plasible? <BR>'

  body: Sure its possible. Many typefaces start out as word shape sketches. When you
    are designing a logo, you have much more freedom than in a typeface. For instance,
    in the word Typophile, the letter T will only be followed by the letter y, o by
    p, and so on. In a typeface, the letter T must be able to be followed by 255 other
    characters. <BR> <BR>Of course, what style you want to use, plus what materials
    you will be using &#40;and your skill with them&#41; will determine the time needed.
    <BR> <BR>What is the company name?
