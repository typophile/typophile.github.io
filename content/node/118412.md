  body: I relay Stephen Rapp's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/memoir|Memoir]].
    His [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Stephen_Rapp|Hiatus or Montague]] looks interesting
    as well. Correspondence Ink [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/belluccia|Bellucia]]
    and Tart Workshop [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Nelly+script|Nelly Script]]
    are very nice too.
