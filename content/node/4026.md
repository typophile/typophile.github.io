body: I was wondering what font was used for the Konami logo.  I know for a fact that
  it&#39;s a serif-type font.  As far as which one it is, I&#39;m not sure.  Can anyone
  help me? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/32297.jpg"

  body: This question came up a couple of months ago and was never answered. Even
    my friend who does contract work for the company was unable to get an answer to
    the question, unfortunately. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23838.html">Here&#39;s
