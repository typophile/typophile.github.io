  my PC died, I switched to Mac but after a discussion with the email support people,
  Fontlab don't allow crossgrading and want me to buy a new full licence. \r\nIm a
  hobbyist so this is out of the question for now.\r\n\r\nAny ideas of my options
  here?\r\n\r\nCheers Typophiles.\r\nP.s anyone moving from Mac to Pc anytime soon?

  body: I know some people run Windows FontLab on Macs with emulation software (e.g.
    Parallels). Obtaining that would be cheaper than buying a new FLab license, and
    the current Windows version is more stable and bug-free than the Mac version anyway.

    it was said [[http://typophile.com/node/61292#comment-366802|by Adam Twardoch]]
    on this very forum, so I don't think a conspiratorial hush-job is in the works
    in this instance."

  body: "I run the Windows version of FontLab under Parallels. One has the usual Mac
    problem of the delete key not actually deleting things (!), but other than that
    it is good and, as others have noted, more stable than the Mac version.\r\n\r\nHrant,
    I recall several people making the point about the superiority of Windows FontLab
    here over the past few years; I know I have more than once. I understand that
    the latest Mac upgrade build (5.1?) is supposed to be a significant improvement
    in this regard, although I have not tried it. FontLab replaced their entire Mac
    development team, I believe."

    Is Parallels the best option for running FontLab?\r\n\r\n2. Anybody running the

    glad I have a few options now and really appreciate the help with this.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    than 5.1. Certainly some things are better now, but some old bugs are still there,
    plus some new nasty ones.\r\n\r\nI tried to work with 5.1, but there were some
    things that I had to do in 5.0 anyway, so I decided to go back until they get
    fixed or until I have the time to switch to a less buggy application."

  body: As a user of both pc and mac, I can definitely say the Windows version of
    Fontlab is far more stable (it has only crashed twice in the past ten months,
    and both times were my fault). As FontLab isn't particularly CPU intensive (for
    most tasks), running it in a Windows emulator (VMWare or something similar), shouldn't
    cause any issues. Most of the issues I've seen (in the Mac version), usually result
    from MM work and more python script based work than from drawing glyphs or opentype
    scripting.
