body: "So for the second semester of my Introduction to Typographic Design studio
  my first project involves a two page editorial spread.  One of the articles is a
  piece on the differing opinions of \"Green Design.\" For this particular rough draft
  I've enjoyed the typeface Memphis (having just developed a certain fondness for
  slab serifs).  \r\n\r\nMy only dilemma is now that I'm having trouble picking a
  good second font choice (particularly looking for a sans serif) that does well to
  compliment Memphis and plays well off of its morphology.  \r\n\r\nHere is an example
  of one of the ways that Memphis might be used in my project.  \r\n\r\nThanks for
  the help.  I'm new to typography but have been thoroughly enamored with it and am
  taking the initiative to supplement my formal education with self-education and
  these forums have been a huge resource. \r\n\r\n"

    Fuller Benton, who also designed a knockoff of Memphis called Stymie.
