body: Since I started using the OpenType version of the  <BR>Neutraface family in
  InDesign <i>&#40;this is what digital  <BR>typography always was meant to be, although
  the  <BR>OpenType features of Neutraface are VERY basic  <BR>unfortunately&#41;</i>
  I constantly need to switch back to  <BR>the PostScript version when I want to work
  in  <BR>other software. <BR> <BR>For example for a congress book I&#39;m currently  <BR>designing,
  the cover is done in Adobe Illustrator 10  <BR>&#40;no support for OpenType&#41;,
  but the book itself is  <BR>in Adobe InDesign 2 &#40;OpenType supported&#41;. I  <BR>can
  activate only one version at the time in ATM,  <BR>because it sees them as conflicting
  duplicates  <BR>&#40;quite logical IMO&#41;. So when I want to switch  <BR>software,
  I have to deactivate and remove one  <BR>version of the fonts and then import the
  other  <BR>version. This is a bit tedious. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know a more elegant
  way for doing  <BR>this? &#40;And please don&#39;t give me any &#34;try designing  <BR>your
  cover in InDesign too&#34; nonse, smartypants!&#41;  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"

  body: If you dont need to work on the files outside the studio, I would see no ethical
    problem in taking the PostScript version into FLab &#40;or a lesser editor&#41;
    and making a new version with a different name / id?

  body: Why change versions just because Illustrator 10 does not support OT features?
    Your OT version is still a PostScript font, and should behave just like a PS font
    in Illustrator.

  body: 'OTs handle like PS Fonts in most other applications &#40;depending on whether
    it is a PS-based OT or a TTF-based version, but most Pro-OTFs should make no trouble
    with PS-Output&#41;, but of course you won&#39;t get the additional OTF-Features.
    I think its about time other programs start implementing OT. Professional Open
    Type is a wonderful thing, and yeah, I find myself working more and more with
    InDesign because of this, even with jobs I might have done in FH before. '

  body: I agree with you Yves, about illustrator, its how the wrapper of the Sabon
    Next has been done last year, when the specimens themselves done win Indesign.
    This make sense. <BR> <BR> <BR>Anyway, not far before the OT support in AI 11.
    <BR> <BR>About OT fonts, when you start to use them, its difficult to work without
    them. More and more, I do a private version of my PS fonts with some OT features
    for a particularly job, it help to save time.

  body: I&#39;m not as up-to-date on Illustrator 11 as Jean is; however, I have encountered
    a similar problem with a corporate identity piece I designed in InDesign. The
    client came back to me and asked for a .dxf file of the logo for output on a CAD
    system. Fortunately, I had both the OT and PS version of the font, but had to
    revert to using an Expert font to get the old style figures. Good thing I didn&#39;t
    need to match the tracking and kerning exactly. Matching the Optical kerning and
    Optical margin alignment from InDesign in Illustrator would be tedious.  <BR>
    <BR>I agree with Yves though, for single pages of closely integrated text and
    illustration, I still prefer Illustrator.

  body: Bill, you do know that you can convert the fonts to outlines in InDesign,
    right? <BR> <BR>Convert to outlines then you can drop it into Illustrator and
    export as dxf, complete with all the optical kerning settings and everything.
    <BR> <BR>And Yves, as far as Neutraface&#39;s opentype features being poor, are
    you using the &#34;pro&#34; version of Neutraface or the just plain Opentype version?  They
    have the same glyphs, but the &#34;pro&#34; version is condensed into like 6 files,
    AFAIK.

    <BR>I constantly drop vector art from Illustrator to  <BR>InDesign and back. Works
    a treat, I just lurve it! <BR>Just brilliant when you need to align a logo on  <BR>the
    baseline for example.

  body: '&#62;Bill, you do know that you can convert the fonts to outlines in InDesign,
    right? &#60; <BR> <BR>Now that I think about it, yes, but at the time, I&#39;d
    forgotten about that feature. The thing is, that for that iteration of the Logo
    and address, I designed a slightly different format. &#40;Boxes on plots are soooooo
    graphically interesting&#41; I needed the type to be type, and not outlines of
    type. Although, I did convert it to outlines before exporting to .dxf, so maybe
    my initial surmise was moot. Thank you Chris for reminding me of that feature.
    <BR> <BR>I too look forwards to having more parity in Illustrator with InDesign.
    Last I heard, it was going to be late Fall before the release, but that was not
    from a source that I'
