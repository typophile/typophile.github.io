body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nSo, I'm having trouble previewing a few fonts with Font Agent
  Pro - Mac OSX.\r\n\r\nInstead of displaying the proper typeface when previewed,
  they appear as a generic san-serif font which is incorrect. The pattern seams to
  happen most often with True Type fonts. The Font cache has been cleared and F.A.P.
  reinstalled a number of times on my machine but still the problem persists.\r\n\r\nThe
  strangest thing is that once these troubled fonts are activated they function fine
  in other applications. They also preview fine in OSX's FontBook. It's only when
  trying to preview from F.A.P. it becomes an issue. I contact F.A.P's Tech support
  and went through there suggested fixes but the problem still persists.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone experienced this or know of a possible solution?\r\n\r\nAny help is much
  appreciated!\r\n\r\n"
