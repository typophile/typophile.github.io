    is appropriate for advanced font management utilities (perhaps with some kind
    of sanity testing to ensure values are within tolerances based on the font itself)
    but was of little use to regular users. '

  body: This is great thinking on Microsoft's part. Nobody can fill Robert Norton's
    shoes, but Spiekermann would be on anyone's shortlist to do for Microsoft in this
    period what Norton did for his. It's a sensible move and it's as safe as anything
    can be in this uncertain world. Maybe it will also be exciting? I expect a lot
    of good to come from this either way.

    thing is hrant, some of these gee-wiz features are already in the shipping version

    at the Finder level in Leopard. Fontbook can turn off fonts without removing them,
    etc. The fact is Apple will probably release at least one more version of OS X
    before 7 ships. The current version of Windows(Vista), still uses the Add Fonts
    dialog from the 90s. Bundling more and more fonts with the product is fine, but
    I might point out that this is something that often annoys Mac users. \r\n\r\nGabriella

    To me it's more about commissioning high-quality custom fonts, as opposed to:
    distorting the already monstrous ITC Garamond; tweaking Myriad and pretending
    it's Frutiger; swiping Comic Sans; getting one guy to hack up non-Latins like
    Mshtakan, etc.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<cite>Not to mention that Apple has done little architecturally to improve
    on screen rendering or the text layout engine.</cite>\r\n\r\nMy really-big-prediction-that-may-never-come-true
    is that the One True Solution to screen rendering is to ditch low-res screens
    (72-96ppi) and use a resolution independent GUI. To accomplish this will require
    insane hardware requirements and an ability for the system to resample/resize
    all bitmaps on the fly. Around 2000, Apple switched to OS X, forcing users to
    pretty much abandon all the software they had and endure a painfully slow new
    system. MS couldn't afford to do this, and we ended up with Vista. The same thing
    could play out again if Apple runs out of feature ideas and needs to sell more
    computers. A lot of what they're doing with streamlining APIs and moving GUI elements
    to the GPU seems to be in this direction. If so, the advantages will all show
    up at once in the form of a 300ppi screen, making hinting technologies obsolete."

    are too many elements which compel a leftwards movement, something to watch out
    for since it is the opposite direction to reading.

    think I can honestly say that around 300ppi is where I lose interest in hinting.
    If I'm holding a loupe it might go a bit higher, but not much. Certainly not for
    screen display. \r\n\r\nAlso, my comment was a bit off topic. I think I'm just
    cranky because it doesn't look like Windows 7 is going to be what I hoped. A lot
    of Windows users still haven't left XP because they think Vista is a big bloated
    mess. My hope was that MS was going to keep 7 lean and mean, perhaps with a package
    manager like Ubuntu Linux. I imagined one installing a small base system and then
    installing features and functionality that they want. Typographically, I hoped
    they might actually take the bold step of leaving fonts like Arial out of a default
    install. Hiding them isn't quite the same. "

  body: "Hi All,\r\nOne thing that annoys me about Win 7, is that it installs about
    500 MB of foreign language fonts (mostly East Asian) and I had a hard time to
    get rid of them. I had to fiddle with user/folder/account/login permissions, some
    of them seem to be allways \"in use\" by the system, and what not ...\r\nDont't
    get me wrong. I totaly agree with a system supporting good fonts for all languages.
    But as a big fan of lean font menus (and a lean system in general), I just don't
    see the point of having that amount of fonts, wich I will never, ever use for
    my typographic work.\r\nAt least, I wish Adobe applications would support the
    show/hide feature of Win 7. But they don't seem to care or am I doing something
    wrong?\r\nSo, sorry for ranting in my very first post here. Just got two hours
    of Win-7-font management done ;)"
