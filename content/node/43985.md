  out of the way, but the green outline stays (see below). There is also a little
  green dot in the upper right corner of the character window. \r\n\r\nI \"selected
  all\" & moved the glyph 400 units in the picture below There was an control extra
  point where the \"1\" is, but removing it didn't make the \"green\" go away. What's
  going on? (TIA)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f_5100.gif]"
