body: Aside from the obvious slight nuances...can anyone tell me the major differences
  between ADOBE and STANDARD versions of Futura? I have a client that wants to change
  from Futura STANDARD to ADOBE and they want to know what the impact would be. I
  have to say I don't really think it would be that noticeable having looked at and
  worked with both. Then looking at the typefaces side by side. Is one easier to work
  with from a production standpoint? Any thoughts? Thanks everyone!

    opposed to Pro, I gather.)\r\n\r\nSo the question is, if your \"standard\" is
    not from Adobe, whence does it come?"

  body: "Thanks! Thats a really good point! I thought I had the \"standard\" to begin
    with. This all arose because the in-house designer is questioning my selection.
    Hmm. How can I figure out where my font originated? And even more important is
    this worth making a complete redesign to the masthead, headlines, etc? The differences
    are so slight.\r\n"

    your \"standard\" Futura is from:\r\nAdobe allows modifications to their fonts
    (with some\r\nconditions). So for example if you ever need to add\r\nor modify
    a character you won't be stuck.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Interesting...Thank you so much! so maybe good to change the body copy and
    headlines moving forward and the items that are outlined and will not change can
    be left as is?
