  body: ' I think that it is a wonderful beautiful and graceful feminine form that
    speaks well to both pottery and to creativity &#40;a sort of womb&#41;. Really
    elegant and strong at the same time. Nicely done, cristian. Could you please provide
    a little more information on the meanings of the words and her vision about chilean
    pottery? For instance, the D doesn&#39;t seem to fit but that may be just because
    I am not understanding the language? '

  body: the simple forms that provides de structure for the letter, are closed to
    the essential and basic method pottery is made. from the clay to the recipient
    &#40;yes in looks like an elegant womb that also develops this idea&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Origen means Origin, this also remind me basic lines, and the D is a way the
    client use to spell out from. &#34;From the Origin&#34; is the final concept.
    <BR> <BR>And in fact, the &#34;D&#34; was one of the changes the client suggested.
    <BR> <BR>here is the final version, i don&#39;t know why i like more the first
    one. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/3091.jpg"

  body: ' The new version is much better.  The bold D stole the impact of the interesting
    symbol above it.  Now it fits better. <BR> <BR>I think the &#34;g&#34; could be
    improved, but I&#39;m not sure how. <BR> <BR>Paul D '

  body: Cristian, very nice. <BR>A more open &#34;g&#34; might be better; look at
    the structure of the one in Hobo&#42; &#40;no, I&#39;m not kidding&#41;, but maybe
    make it more swashy. <BR> <BR>&#42; <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Character?id=0067&amp;vid=33066&amp;charset=CP2&amp;charpage="

  body: ' This is nice. Very soft and organic. <BR> <BR>The thinning of the letters,
    as in your &#39;r&#39;, &#39;i&#39; and &#39;n&#39; ... could this occur in the
    other characters? I might consider making the bottom loop on the &#39;g&#39; a
    bit more dainty, it almost over powers the top loop. By dainty I mean smaller
    and more narrow &#40;not much&#41;. The bullet seems a little on this side of
    large also. Is the &#39;D&#39; the same stroke width as the other characters? '

  body: ' U were rigt when u were saying &#34;i don&#39;t know why i like more the
    first one&#34;. I like the fist one more also. I think that the bold D was a great
    connection between text and the &#34;graphical dot&#34; above the &#34;i&#34;.
    Now its little bit floating. <BR>Anyway very nice work :o&#41; '

  body: Here is some improvement on the &#34;g&#34;, I open more the bottom loop to
    make it more clear and also a little less heavy. <BR> <BR>what do you think?  <BR>
