  1946 chris-craft race boat that I am currently renovating. I haven't found the right
  one yet though. When it comes to typefaces I realize it was popular with sans-serifs
  and bold display type. Which is not too bad but I want something with a bit more
  edge. So either that or if anyone could put me in the know of some hand lettering
  inspiration/fonts popular in the 40s?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to some input, thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\nMax"

    scripts by Leslie Cabarga eg Raceway might be what you want?"

    style. Anything else comes to mind?\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\n\r\n-\r\nMax"

  body: "Wouldn't script be too similar to the Chris Craft logo?\r\nWhy not have an
    all caps roman type (sans or serif) to contrast with the logo?\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/stellar/\">Stellar</a>
    is an interesting mid-century American face, a little more animated than Optima.\r\nI
    like the look of colored lettering on wood, but with a fine gold outline, the
    metallic effect acting as a buffer zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick, the CC logo goes on the hull side, and doesn't really interfere with
    the transom type I think. Stellar is an interesting choice but perhaps more for
    a cruiser kind of boat.\r\n\r\nI'll try to explain what I am looking for...\r\n\r\nFirst
    please have a look at th boat. One of the smaller pleasure crafts/ski boats that
    CC built at that time. One of the models were named rocket and had a hand drawn
    rocket silhouette on the hullside. My boat will hopefully look  [[http://www.mlvr.com/cc/carrot.jpg|something
    like this]] one day. The rocket model: [[http://www.mlvr.com/cc/cc2.jpg]]\r\n\r\nMy
    intention is to have a simple, kind of naive and cartoon-esque feeling on the
    type. That's why I am looking at hand lettering - to add that homemade look to
    it. Here's some references of what I'm into: \r\n'Thunderbolt' [[http://www.mlvr.com/cc/thunderbolt.jpg]]\r\n[[http://www.mlvr.com/cc/type1.jpg]]\r\n\r\nThe
    name of the boat is Libertine and will perhaps be typed with year i.e. \"Libertine
    '46\" and followed by \"STOCKHOLM\" where it is located, set in a complementing
    sans-serif. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about Charbonne, any of the oblique styles:
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/charbonne/]]\r\nOr [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/superheterodyne/]].
    When it comes to scripts I like these, without none of them being the right one:
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/alphabetsoup/metroscript/]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sideshow/coffee-service/]].\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMax\r\n\r\n\r\n"
