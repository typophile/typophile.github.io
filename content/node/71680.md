    seems fairly close for these letters. I suspected a more common font, but the
    'e' was not right for most I could think of.\r\n\r\nIf you have a better selection
    of letters you might try the <a href=\"http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php\">Sans
    Serif ID Guide</a> yourself, and see if something jumps out. The Key letters for
    the Guide are a,e,g,y, G, M and R.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    up with another image I've found. Though the lowercase 'a' I'm looking at is edited
    to an extent,but for the most part,I think your correct. Thanks,Mike.\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Viviane was correct about Akzidenz Grotesk. I compared the letters of all
    the images I could find that the original designer used this font in,and got a
    perfect match with Akzidenz Grotesk Bold. Though I give a big thanks to both of
    you. '
