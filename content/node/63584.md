  by using chaining contextual substitutions but I've had only partial success.\r\n\r\nRather
  than explain the different methods I've tried, is there someone who has done this
  successfully and can give me an example of how to do this?\r\nI'm using the latest
  version of AFDKO (with full support for all GSUB types) under OS X 10.4.11 and testing
  in InDesign CS3."

    you are trying to achieve. Are the relevant glyphs adjacent or nonadjacent? How
    long are the glyph strings involved? That sort of thing.\r\n\r\nNote also that
    AFAIK InDesign doesn't actually implement all of the GSUB types supported by AFDKO
    2.5.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
