  figures fit better with the emerging styles of the early-20th-century Modern revolution,
  but the term \"[[oldstyle figures|old-style figures]]\" has always puzzled me. It
  makes them sound outdated. I use them all the time where they're appropriate...\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
  just a newbie being curious. I'm eager to hear your responses."

  body: "Type was first knowingly modernized in the early 19th century.\r\nIt was
    understood at the time that technical improvements in printing necessitated a
    new style of type: it was described as modern at the time (more accurately now
    \"didone\"), although not named as such. Foundries then named their basic text
    types solely by the size.\r\n\r\nAs well as the new didone style there were other
    changes, most notably dropping the long \"s\" and introducing lining figures.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    all the old type was melted down, so it wasn't around to be called \"old style\".\r\nThat
    comparison came in the mid 19th century, with the introduction of the modernized
    old-style, which was not a strict revival of any particular historical type, but
    a version of the modern type with certain old-style features -- including old-style
    figures, but not necessarily. It was called old-style, while the \"basic\" text
    type continued to be named by its size, or as just \"roman\": the modern was the
    default.\r\n\r\nI don't know when old-style figures were first referred to as
    such.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, when Futura was first published in the 1930s, it had
    old-style figures.\r\n\r\nNow, with the InDesign OpenType palette suggesting that
    all typefaces should have both old-style and lining figures, even if that creates
    anachronisms, the picture gets a bit post-modern. For instance, I have included
    old-style figures in Scotch Modern, which is a facsimile-class revival of a face
    that would never have had them."

  body: "I prefer the term text figures, since their temporary eclipse by lining figures
    in the nineteenth century doesn't make them old per se, just out of fashion for
    a while before people rediscovered that using lining figures within text is the
    equivalent of all-caps within text, i.e., shouting. I prefer to use lining figures
    in titles and other all-caps settings, numeric tables, folios, and other places
    where they stand apart from the text proper, and to use text figures otherwise.\r\n\r\nEffectively,
    lining figures are upper-case figures and text figures are lower-case figures,
    names I've not heard used much for them but that better describe their purposes.\r\n\r\nAs
    long as we're distinguishing cases of figures, a far rarer case of figure that
    I use in a special circumstance is the small-caps figure - numerals scaled to
    work in strings of small caps. This setting was pointed out by Geoffrey Dowding
    in Finer Points on the Spacing and Arrangement of Type, namely when using strings
    entirely composed of small caps as display matter, such as in ads or in secondary
    or tertiary subheads. In these settings, text figures don't blend with the small
    caps much better than lining figures do, since none of the rest of the line has
    ascenders or descenders. However, although I do use small-caps figures with small-caps
    letters in these special situations, normally I pair small-caps letters with text
    figures. When small-caps letters are used in their usual setting, i.e. to represent
    acronyms or other secondary forms of emphasis within text matter, it's better
    to pair them with text figures, which blend better with the lower-case letters
    that make up the bulk of the line. The recent Linotype faces (such as Optima nova
    and Palatino nova), Lapture, Tabac, Underground, and Mrs. Eaves include small-caps
    figures; I wish more would."

    some interesting critique of mixing small caps with text figures."

    with lowercase or u&lc text settings.

  body: "There was an Adobe publication (broadside, <cite>Font & Function</cite>,
    was it?) a few years back where it was mentioned that when signage became an important
    part of printing in the latter part of the 19th century, a lot of the advertisements
    used full caps. SPECIAL TODAY! etc. The numbers of the time -- \"old style\" figures
    = looked bad with those full caps. So \"Modern\" figures became standard. From
    a timing perspective, \"modern\" figures are just as modern as the hoop skirt.
    \r\n\r\nAs with so much for too long, advertising rules the type world."

  body: "I have a copy of an old version of \"Teach Yourself Calculus\", in which
    there are a few pages with log and trig tables... set in old style figures. In
    the metal type era, at least, digits were monospaced whether they were old style
    or lining, because many typefaces came with only one kind of digit (although there
    were also several where both were available as alternates) and you could never
    be sure that at some point tabular matter would not be needed.\r\n\r\nWith today's
    technology, providing additional alternates is much easier, and so getting away
    from monospacing, at least with oldstyle figures (also doing so with lining figures,
    even lining figures with small cap height, sounds very bold and adventurous to
    me) is now an option open to consideration.\r\n\r\nBut given the precedent that
    digits were monospaced just about universally (except in the more outr\xE9 display
    typefaces) a monospaced version should always be available as an alternate, I
    would think."
