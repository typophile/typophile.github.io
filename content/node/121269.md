body: Hi I am starting up an Eyelash Extension spa- the logo picture is a very rough
  draft. My demographic is early 20s to late 40s with average being late 20s-early
  30s. Am trying to convey an upscale, chic, modern (but not cold), stylish, with
  elegant/feminine touch. Suggestions of typefaces is VERY appreciated! Have been
  going crazy trying to find something that looks ok. Was thinking modern/script but
  am open to other typefaces/script. Also what would you recommend then for tagline?
  (Logo might be edited with box around it and/or without tagline). Again your guys
  feedback is very very much appreciated!
