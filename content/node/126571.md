  names from Tanita Tikaram's 1999 release \"The Cappucino Songs\".</p>\r\n<p>I've
  been unsuccessful with both WhatTheFont and Identifont so far.</p>\r\n<p>The only
  useful features I've been able to identify is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the lowercase
  \"g\" which looks quite unique - it doesn't seem to have a distinct ear</li>\r\n<li>the
  terminals of the a, c, e and s ending in a slightly sharp point - the ends seem
  not quite upright and also don't seem to be perpendicular to the strokes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Any
  help would be appreciated.</p>"
