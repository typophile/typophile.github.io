body: "Hi all,\r\nI was wondering if it were possible to use FontForge's AutoKern
  feature to kern only one character.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that I have set up the
  kerning for most of the characters I have and recently introduced a new one. I don't
  want to run AutoKern and remove the custom kerning that I have done on those.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nCale"

  body: If you are using a recent version of FontForge, when you create a new kern
    subtable, you will be presented by a dialogue where you can select glyphs you
    want to autokern. Check [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/lookups.html#Pair the|the
    documentation]].

  body: "I tried creating a subtable under my original horizontal kerning lookup and
    was presented with a dialogue after naming the new subtable:\r\n\r\n<code>Kerning
    may be specified either by classes of glyphs or by pairwise combinations of individual
    glyphs. Which do you want for this subtable? PAIRS / CLASSES / CANCEL </code>\r\n\r\nI
    selected Pairs,and was then confronted with this box:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lookup_3980.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    didn't see the Kerning Format box appear.\r\n\r\nI'm running the 2009-09-08 release
    of FontForge for Intel 64bit Macs under 10.6."

  body: The latest release is 2010-05-01, but George no longer provide pre-built binaries,
    you have to either get binaries from third parties (e.g. any Linux distribution,
    [[http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/macports.html|MacPorts]]
    on Mac) or build it on your own (that is what I do myself). I just checked MacPorts
    and they list the latest version on their [[http://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=category&substr=fonts|website]].

  body: Thanks for your help, Khaled. Although as I've got no idea what to do with
    http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/graphics/fontforge/Portfile , I'm
    afraid I'm going to have to ask you for guidance on how to get the actual programme...

  body: I've no idea either, I never used Mac OS, but I guess you need to install
    MacPorts first, and use it to install fontforge. You can follow the [[http://www.macports.org/install.php|installation
    instructions]] and other [[http://guide.macports.org/|documentations]].

  body: "Okay, I installed MacPorts and did the things required to install FontForge
    via this page: http://openfontlibrary.org/wiki/How_to_install_FontForge\r\n\r\nI
    can tell that FontForge has been updated, it now has little icons in the menus,
    but when I select Help/About, I am informed that the installed build is Version
    02:34 GMT 8-Sep-2009 (20090908) and the library is 13:17 GMT 5-Sep-2009.\r\n\r\nIf
    this is correct, this is not the latest 2010-05-01 build.\r\n\r\nSo I'm really
    quite confused now. How do I go about installing the 2010-05-01 build if the MacPorts
    \ <code>sudo port install fontforge</code> only gives me the 2009 version?\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks to anyone who can lend a hand on this. Messing around inside the Terminal
    really isn't my thing!\r\n\r\nCale\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: I just run <code>port
    info fontforge</code> and was told that I have fontforge @20100501...\r\n\r\n...in
    which case, I am still not being presented with the Kerning Format dialogue...
    and I guess I shall presume that the information in the About box was incorrect
    when it told me I have the 20090908 version?\r\n"

  body: I'd first make sure to remove the previously installed FontForge, and then
    install it through MacPorts, looks like you are getting the old one.

    hidden folders deleting stuff (and then realising I could just type <code> sudo
    port uninstall fontforge</code> I managed to get rid of it and then install the
    latest version with <code> sudo port install fontforge</code>... and now I'm getting
    the glyph selection window.\r\n\r\nWhew! What an epic journey that was!"

  body: "Now that I have the option to set which glyphs I want to kern, I'm curious
    as to how to select more than one kerning pair (for instance, ra, rb, rc etc)
    to make use of the 'AutoKern Selected' button in the Lookup Subtable box. At present,
    it seems I can only click one kerning pair at a time. Using the shift key to select
    multiple does not work.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how to select more than one kerning
    pair?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nCale"

  body: '"Selected" here refers to glyphs selected in the main font view not in the
    kern dialogue itself. (you can''t select glyphs while the dialogue is opened,
    you have to close it, select, and re-open it).'

    technique from source goes:\r\nInstall XCode from apple\r\nInstall macports and

    and go to the fontforge source folder\r\n<code>configure</code>\r\n<code>make</code>\r\n<code>install</code>\r\n\r\nand
    then i have a fresh fontforge app, after a few minutes of hardcore terminal output.\r\n"

  body: "The old version shouldn't pose any problems, although that depends on where
    your building from.\r\nIf your compiling from source (and it builds correctly
    - watch for warnings in the terminal window) it will write over your existing
    versions. You've given it <code>sudo</code> privileges so you won't get/see any
    feedback on this happening.\r\n\r\nI'd stay away from the pre-compiled versions.
    The dev guy doesn't seem to support mac as a priority, and the last time i checked
    he doesn't test his releases on many flavours of mac. The source versions work
    just fine though.\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that the build takes all those libraries
    in the hidden folders (<code>usr</code>, <code>lib</code> etc) which your populating
    via macport and and dumps the finished build into applications (don't ask me how
    it knows!).\r\nFor the record, i've had to do this on four macs ranging from 10.4
    to snow leopard. it works."
