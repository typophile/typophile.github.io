  I use it quite a bit and I feel a bit <BR> silly when someone asks me what it is
  and  <BR>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m saying it correctly...

  body: I&#39;ve asked myself the same question many times. We should build a database
    like on <a href="http://www.m-w.com" target="_blank">www.m-w.com</a> where you
    can hear the name of each typeface spoken aloud. I bet there would be a lot of
    debate over some of them though... <BR> <BR>Is it like Accidents-t?

    be pronounced &#34;Aktsidents&#34;. <BR> <BR>Good question about Frutiger.  My
    English tongue is always tempted to say &#34;FROO t&#39; grr&#34;, but in French,
    of course, the g is soft.  I don&#39;t know if the r is pronounced or if it ends
    with an &#34;ay&#34; sound. <BR> <BR>Paul'

    <BR> <BR>&#40;My little attempt at a joke up there went somehow awry. I forgot
    that the <i>g</i> would be pronounced with a hard sound when followed by an <i>o</i>
    in French, just as in English. I was thinking they were pronouncing it... Oh,
    nevermind.&#41;

    is a French word &#40;no end-&#34;e&#34;&#41;: &#60;&uuml;-nee-v-airr&#62;. I
    doubt native English speaking people can pronounce the opening vowel properly,
    as the German &#34;&uuml;&#34;/Dutch &#34;uu&#34; is a sound they can&#39;t reproduce
    &#40;in fact, it&#39;s not even possible to write down a phonetic equivalent in
    English&#41;. It&#39;ll sound like &#34;oo&#34;. <BR> <BR>The same problem arises
    with &#34;Eurostile&#34; which is pronounced: &#60;eu-ro-steel&#62;. Here again,
    the opening vowel is totally alien to the English language and will most likely
    get bastardized to &#34;you&#34; by native English speakers. <BR> <BR>Regarding
    &#34;Akzidenz&#34;, I think Gregory was right, Paul. There are different ways
    of pronouncing the &#34;z&#34; in German in relation to specific letter combinations,
    and I doubt the combination &#34;kz&#34; sounds like &#60;kts&#62;. Are there
    any native German speakers on the board to enlighten us?'

  body: Karen, not just that, but sometimes it&#39;s pretty hopeless, even in person.
    For example, &#34;officina&#34; is an Italian word &#40;it can&#39;t be Spanish,
    because of the double-&#34;f&#34;&#41;, so the &#34;c&#34; is pronounced as a
    &#34;tch&#34;, but most people &#40;including some old-timers&#41; say &#34;ofisina&#34;.
    Maybe even including Spiekermann? But maybe the creator <i>can</i> determine the
    pronunciation? <BR> <BR>BTW, you&#39;ll probably have to invite yourself &#40;ATypI-Vancouver
    and/or TypeCon2003&#41;, but once you do it&#39;s a total blast. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: '&#40;please excuse my humble english - ask if something is not clearly understandable
    - correct me, for I can improve&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;Akzidenz&#34; has a latin origin.
    It comes from &#34;accido&#34;.  <BR>&#34;Accido&#34; itself is a combination
    of &#34;ad&#34; &#40;in combination with c... changed to ac ...&#41;&#40;it means
    &#34;to&#34;&#41; and &#34;cado&#34; which means &#34;falling&#34; &#40;also in
    the sense of falling to something = joining&#41; - so it means &#34;&#40;the characteristic&#41;
    falling to something&#34;.  <BR>&#34;c&#34; in latin is pronounciated differently:
    before i and e its like &#34;ts&#34; - before other vowels and after vowels its
    like &#34;k&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#34;accidentia&#34; or &#34;accidens&#34; means the
    non-essential, the changing, the things by coincidence or chance. It means features
    or characteristics that are secondary to something, not their essential being.
    <BR>In philosophy we distinguish between &#34;substantia&#34; and &#34;accidentia&#34;.
    accidentia are characteristics that belong to something, its taste, colour, and
    so on, but that can change without changing its being, its substantia. <BR> <BR>In
    typography &#40;in German language tradition&#41; &#34;Akzidentia&#34; are all
    printing jobs by chance, prospects, folders, flyers, letterheads, business cards,
    ads. They require individual design and often other type than standard &#34;Werksatz&#34;
    &#40;sorry, my english hasn&#39;t developed to typographycal terms yet, maybe
    it could be described as &#34;standard working typography&#34;&#41; for books,
    magazines, and newspapers. <BR>Their design has to attract more attention. They
    are changing more often than the longlasting principles of good and readable book/newspaper
    design. On the other hand their characteristics in design changes, but their substance
    is the same, for example ads. <BR>I find the name &#34;Akzidenz&#34; a very interesting
    parallel between philosophy and typography. <BR> <BR>The use was naming the font:
    <BR>As far as I know, Sanserifs were first used for ads and posters - typical
    &#34;Akzidenzien&#34;, so this font was named after its use. <BR> <BR>'
