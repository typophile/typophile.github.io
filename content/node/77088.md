  to understand the logic behind using individual fontinfo files with MakeOTF instead
  of putting that information into FontMenuNameDB. I\u2019m assuming that there\u2019s
  a very good reason for doing it this way and I should probably know what it is before
  I start doing font production with MakeOTF instead of Fontlab."

  body: "The \"fontinfo\" file (for name-keyed fonts; CID-keyed fonts use the \"cidfontinfo\"
    file) serves as a way to specify MakeOTF options without specifying them on the
    command line. The following are some examples:\r\n\r\nIsBoldStyle                 false\r\nIsItalicStyle
    \              false\r\nPreferOS/2TypoMetrics       true\r\nIsOS/2WidthWeigthSlopeOnly
    \ true\r\nIsOS/2OBLIQUE               false\r\nUseOldNameID4               false\r\n\r\nIt
    is true that many of the fields in this file seem redundant, because the same
    information is present in the font.pfa (Type 1) files. Part of this is due to
    the former way in which we built Type 1 fonts that involved individual \"bez\"
    files in a \"bez\" directory, each of which represented a glyph.\r\n\r\nThe \"FontMenuNameDB\"
    file is used only for setting the font's menu name strings for the 'name' table.\r\n\r\nI
    will ask read to chime in with additional details\u2026 \u2026or to correct anything
    that wrote above. :-)"

  body: "I agree that it would be a nicer design to have a single file contain the
    data that it is now spread between the FontMenuNameDB file and the fontinfo file.
    The reason that makeotf has both  is becuase of history, not because of optimal
    de novo design. For some years, our old production workflow for Type 1 fonts needed
    to stay functional, while we were also running a new production workflow for OpenType/CFF
    fonts from the same sources. The old system required the fontinfo file. Since
    the fontinfo file had to exist for the old workflow and duplicating source data
    is always dangerous, we used the fontinfo file as the source for the relevant
    data for the new workflow, and made a separate FontMenuNameDB file for the new
    production workflow.\r\n\r\nWe have now dropped Type 1 production, and are free
    combine the two files into one. However, software development is expensive, and
    you need strong motivation to spend a few days to change a design that is working
    without bugs to a more elegant design that, because it is new, probably will have
    bugs. \r\n\r\nKen's one error was in commenting that the fontinfo file contains
    info that is also in the Postscript font. This is true for some of the Adobe fontinfo
    files which have survived since the Type1 production days, when the fontinfo file
    was a source for the Type 1 font file data, but makeotf doesn't use that info.
    The only fields in the fontinfo that makeotf uses are not present in the Type1
    source font file.\r\n\r\n- Read"

  body: "In addition to what Ken and Read added, we are also now starting to put hinting
    information in the fontinfo files. This allows the autohinter to hint classes
    of glyphs using only the hinting zones that apply specifically to those classes.\r\n\r\nSo
    for Arno Regular, here is the hinting that lists the zones for the lower case:\r\n\r\n<code>begin
    FDDict LOWERCASE\r\n\tBaselineYCoord 0\r\n\tBaselineOvershoot -18\r\n\tLcHeight
    395\r\n\tLcOvershoot 15\r\n\tAscenderHeight 672\r\n\tAscenderOvershoot 6\r\n\tDescenderHeight

    false\r\nend FDDict LOWERCASE</code>\r\n\r\nand here is a hinting dictionary of
    the lower case, which consists of regular expressions that will capture all the

    had no idea that I can break it down like that. Are the two values for DominantV
    and DominantH for straight stems and wider curved stems? And is this detailed

  body: "My memory for all this is pretty much what Read said, in terms of reasons
    \"back in the day.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one other factor, which is that because
    font menu names tend to be coordinated across an entire family, and we were also
    converting the entire Adobe Type Library and trying to have consistency in how
    we handled menu names both within and between families, we found it very convenient
    to have all the font menu names in one file.\r\n\r\nThis was also true when dealing
    with a font family, even when there wasn't a whole library conversion involved.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
