  body: General collections &#34;House Broken&#34; doesn&#39;t match. Their sampler
    stencil doesn&#39;t match. Their Flyer Fonts &#34;Reject&#34; doesn&#39;t match.

  body: Thanks for the effort. This may not exist as a digital font. <BR> <BR>How
    about the base font, though, without the stencil effect? We could then do our
    own stencil &#34;cutting.&#34;

    target="_blank">Franklin Gothic Condensed</a> in a heavy weight would be fairly
    close, I think.
