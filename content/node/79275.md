body: "Hello all!\r\n\r\nThis is my first typeface and I have been working on it for
  a few months now. I was inspired by large families like Scala and Nexus and also
  others like titillium and Interstate. So I created this and *legibell txt (can be
  found under critique > serif). My goal is to create a nice, readable, unique transportation
  font family with multiple weights (I'll add them once I am happy with the general
  design of the regular). I've worked a bit on the kerning and spacing, but it's not
  all sorted out yet; I just really wanted some feedback on the look and design of
  it. \r\n\r\nAny critique or commentary would be great! Thanks,\r\n\r\n"

  body: Nice work. It reads very well. It's sharp, clean and, well, likeable. You've
    made a lot of nice choices with the descenders. And I can imagine with such an
    economical style you're working with, the capital Q was a challenge, but you solved
    it nicely. Overall, I like it quite a bit. I can't think of anything bad to say
    about it. Good job!

  body: It has a nice feel to it but lowercase k looks very black and congested in
    the bold and I find the angle of the top of the ascenders a little too steep.
    Am I too conservative when I say I would like the d to have the same angle on
    the ascender as all the others

  body: Reminds a bit of Interstate because of angular cut verticals.
