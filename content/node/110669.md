  lettering. This image is presumably of a historical antecedent of the current Savile
  Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, tailors to the Queen etc etc\u2026[img:sites/default/files/old-images/about_gieves_and_hawkes_5097.jpg]"

  body: "Probably lettering in a popular style of the early 20th century, rather than
    a specific font. Note the tilde shape for the center stroke on E. Here is a somewhat
    similar digital font called Jonquin \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/jonquin/\r\nby
    a British foundry, Greater Albion Typefounders, which is \"inspired by some hand
    lettering seen on a World -War One recruiting poster.\"\r\nMove the tilde stroke
    to mid level and do some other relatively minor tinkering and you are in the ballpark
    for your lettering.\r\nOther digital fonts with the E tilde include Tenebra by
    Franti\u0161ek \u0160torm \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/tenebra/\r\nThe
    E tilde is in the lowercase.\r\nFor more information on fonts with the tilde see:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/103815\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Can't name this one and doubting actually it could have been a font, more
    probably a sign painting or a custom lettering for Gieve(s) (which could make
    sense when talking about tailors to the King...).\r\nI'm wondering also if the
    /E median crossbar is [[http://typophile.com/node/103815|flame-shaped]]. Anyway,
    some clients for customization: [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bolyar|Bolyar]]

    (my vote), [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/bostontruckstyle.php|Boston
