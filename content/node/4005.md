body: Client has told us one of their departments doesn&#39;t like the sans &#40;too
  hard to read apparently&#41; and they want a serif added to their ID guidelines.
  <BR> <BR>Slab/semi/full serif suggestions welcome. I&#39;ve had a dig around Adrian
  Frutiger&#39;s other designs &#40;seemed a logical place to start&#41; and Versailles
  55 is my favourite thus far - it&#39;s a fraction lighter, but the shapes seem very
  much on par. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts anybody? <BR> <BR>Cameron

  body: I&#39;d go with either Minion or possibly Meridien. <BR> <BR>IMO you don&#39;t
    want to try and match the shapes. A contrast will add more interest to the page.
    I would still use Frutiger in the heads. If you have a large number of headers
    you might use a serif for the lower levels.

  body: Fantastic. I already had Meridien in there as once of the choices, and just
    printing the Minion comparison. Thanks so much for the advice. <BR> <BR>Cameron

  body: I don&#39;t see Meridien &#40;which I really like&#41; as a good companion
    to Frutiger. Bringhurst is just trying to be too clever, or giving too much credit
    to the view that a designer will make all his fonts compatible in some metaphysical
    way... <BR> <BR>I might try something like Kepler or Walbaum instead. <BR> <BR>hhp
