body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am looking for a companion typeface for this logo I created
  for an event (this is Big Top). I would like to use something I might already own,
  but I am not sure what the right feel is. Whenever I look up great depression typefaces
  Futura comes up which does not have the feel I want at all. I don't want a machine
  feel.\r\n\r\nThis is another piece that goes with it. Here I use baskerville..does
  this work? Something seems off to me...help me out.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Carnival_3714.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Col4_5478.jpg]"

  body: "Your type choice is off by decades. Circus/carnival materials of the depression
    era used sans lettering that blended American gothic type styles with humanist
    proportions similar to Gill Sans, mostly drawn by hand. Ornamental wood type like
    that was long out of style by then, and Baskerville was a book face. It\u2019s
    also probably not a good idea to expect a Baskerville to hold up well knocked
    out like that on the tickets, and because ticket printing is usually cheap you
    should just use black or blue on red paper if you want it to look real. "

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nHmm well I do like the ornamental wood typeface I have now...perhaps
    I can let go of the great depression era that I was trying for and just go with
    the ornamental woodtype to simply suggest \" vintage carnival\". If I do that
    then what typeface should be my secondary? They must have had carnivals before
    the great depression right? I want more of the feel of the attached inspiration
    piece.\r\n\r\nThanks James for the printing advice, but i am doing postcards that
    have this graphic on them so that won't be a problem this time.\r\n\r\nthanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/AAAAAvBeVNcAAAAAAJxuLA_5664.jpg]"

  body: "While James is true that the wood types you show are a generation before
    the Great Depression, you can probably still use them for a carnival of that time.
    Carnival posters were printed by specialty printers that had loads of old wood
    type and they used it for years and years. They pretty much ignored the Art Nouveau
    and Art Deco styles that followed, keeping to the big and brash wood types.\r\n\r\nJust
    don't go confusing us with talk about the Depression era, when the look you want
    is more of the Wild West Shows of the late 19th Century. :)\r\n"

    if so which one?\r\n\r\nthanks!!"

  body: "I think your logo works just fine with the present font, although you should
    fix the alignment/skew of \"type on a path\".\r\nIt may not be historically authentic,
    but it is first and foremost the clich\xE9 for circus/fairground type, and looks
    like fun.\r\nDon't use the same font for \"admit one\", as that cheapens the logo,
    which should be repeated (or at lest the type part of it) where you have set its
    name in Baskerville. At the moment, it looks like the name of the event is \"ADMIT
    ONE\"."

  body: "I'm with James, namely on the suggestion of black ink on blue/red paper and
    on his mention of American gothics.\r\n\r\nI think the logotype has got the flowery
    details covered. (Yes, I know we're dealing with a wedding, but even so.) To my
    eye, when you use delicate serif with it, the latter just looks overwhelmed, or
    like it's getting bullied. In response to your question to Nick, yes, I would
    put Baskerville aside, and consider an american display gothic that's got just
    a bit of character to it. Gothic Medium, or Gothic Special if you need a few more
    weights, from Wooden Type Fonts are but some examples.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
