  (details: August, outdoor ceremony, \"rustic elegance\"), so here are a couple of
  my favorites. She's flexible on the green, and on which letters are featured (last
  name is M, bride is B, groom is R), so I'd love to hear any thoughts on the design.
  Have at it!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nCR\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monogramcrit_4096.jpg]"

  body: "Well, since no one else has stepped up to the plate, I guess I'll give it
    a shot. \r\n\r\nAt first glance all three logos look OK, but there are problems
    in the details (it's always the details):\r\n\r\nSome overall comments: the design
    brief calls for \"rustic elegance.\" I see the elegance, but I don't see the rustic
    in any of these monograms. This is an odd combination of attributes since the
    concept of elegance usually would preclude the concept of rustic. If you're trying
    to hint at the rustic element through the choice of color, you might consider
    using a dark brown instead of black. But color alone won't get provide a rustic
    feel. Perhaps the look of an elegant script carved in stone or wood would provide
    the combination, but that might be difficult to convey in a monogram.\r\n\r\n<em>Top
    Monogram</em>\r\nTwo main problems for me here: 1) There are several awkward areas
    in the merged letters: specifically where the lower bowl of the B merges with
    the M, and two odd little remnants of the finishing strokes at the base of the
    M and R; 2) at the size shown here the thin strokes of the B and R are already
    filling up. This monogram should only be used in larger sizes than shown to prevent
    this.\r\n\r\n<em>Middle Monogram</em>\r\nFor me, this is the most successful of
    the three, but it still need some work, especially in the areas where the three
    red arrows point below You need to do some subtle shifting/stretching of the three
    letters to avoid these awkward overlaps. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BR
    Logo_4833.png]\r\nFor the top and bottom areas, either eliminate the little white
    space showing through or increase the visible white space so that it doesn't look
    like the letter elements almost converged but didn't quite. For the area pointed
    to by the middle arrow: Try to adjust the bottom of the top bowl of the B so that
    it is at the same height as the bottom bowl of the R, or else raise it up further
    away. Next, I suspect that the intertwining of the two letters would be enhanced
    if the back stem of the B (near the top red arrow) was placed on top the R rather
    than below it. Finally, this monogram would benefit with a lighter green to help
    differentiate the two letters. \r\n\r\n<em>Bottom Monogram</em>\r\nI'm not sure
    what your intention is with the elipse (...). It is usually used to indicate either
    that something has been left out or the something is to come. I'm not sure how
    either applies to this monogram. Other than that it's just a script M inside an
    oval. OK, but nothing special.\r\n\r\nHope some of these comments help.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

    You're right that the combination of themes, rustic and elegant, has me a little
    conflicted. Thanks for giving it such attention.
