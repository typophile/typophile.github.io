  going through some articles, I realized contrast in typeface is very important but
  i can not find factors of design which affect the contrast. What are the factors
  that affect contrast? Is it x height, thickness of stroke or anything else?\r\nAlso
  to improve legibility, some people are designing fonts with tapered edges( called
  flaring and expansion of edges in a specimen). Does this really affect the legibility?
  and if it does any other points that can affect legibility.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nTypo"

  body: "First off it's important to note that proper empirical testing of typeface
    performance remains elusive. So we don't really Know too much. But that doesn't
    relieve us of the need/benefits of <em>thinking</em>, and acting on our conclusions.\r\n\r\nContrast:
    Do you mean a difference between thick and thin parts of letterforms? If so, it's
    treated (by designers who think straight :-) as its own thing, so others factors
    don't have to affect it, at least not one-directionally - it's more a matter of
    the various attributes being in balance.\r\n\r\nFlaring: I'm assuming you mean
    where the ends of \"strokes\" get thicker. Although serifs are agreed by most
    people as helping readability, and flares could be seen as \"pseudo-serifs\",
    I suspect most people incorporate flaring as a purely stylistic element, not a
    functional one.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Hmmm... i thought flaring meant getting the edges thinner. As you can see
      in the page 11 of the spec book of arrival sans(http://keithtam.net/documents/arrival_spec.pdf)...\r\nAccording
      to the spec books he says flaring increases the visibility from a distance.
      Is this true?"

  body: "I have poor contrast sensitivity and read using a bold font, one with thick
    strokes, e.g., Arial Black.\r\nFonts with serifs tend to have thin strokes connecting
    the verticals and my eyes don't see them, leaving a forest of tree trunks with
    no branches, so I stick to fonts with uniform strokes as being of higher contrast
    throughout. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when displaying copy in white on black,
    I use a font with thin strokes, the copy standing out and my eyes not being blinded
    by the blaze of white in a b/w display."
