  body: By &#34;processed ttf fonts are not required,&#34; do you mean that I could
    create an alphabet all on one page in a drawing program and just give it to you
    that way? I would like to get into professional type design but the cost of font
    software is holding me back, as a starving artist.

  body: You can give it to us that way, if you want to create a pixel font. If it
    is of good visual quality and original design, we will font-ify and publish it
    for you. For outline fonts, the biggest slice of professional type design, you
    will need a font tool. Free ones are available on sourceforge, FontLab is expensive
    and excellent. <BR> <BR>Artists can work in the GIMP, Photoshop, and/or anything
    that can create a GIF, PNG or TIFF. <BR> <BR>We are interested in picture fonts
    too.
