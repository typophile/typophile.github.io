  body: Papyrus comes with an alternate set of larger capital letters. That&#39;s
    what was used here.

  body: The baseline on the &#39;super caps&#39; is lower than the other type, so
    the offset is automatic.

  body: In the font I linked to, the offset is already there, and the alternate caps
    are actually swashes.
