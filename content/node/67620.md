  Sans and I'd like to use it in a project I'm working on. However, that project really
  requires a family with more range in widths. Does anyone have any good alternate
  suggestions to Encore Sans that might have a wider range? Thanks for all your thoughts!"

    was hoping to air more on the "Helvetica" side of the scale. I know that sounds
    obscure, but I hope it makes sense!

    oops. Read widths, thought weights. Now I understand you mean compressed, expanded,
    &c"

  body: My pleasure. Benton Sans' 128 (!) styles would certainly keep you covered
    in any conceivable situation :-)
