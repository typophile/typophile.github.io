  a letter C, which I want to have all the anchor points and handles of this letter
  expanded to be actual paths, so the .eps file itself would contain a letter complete
  with its all anchor points and handles.\r\n\r\nAny idea if there's an elegant way
  to do this, beyond just screengrabbing and tracing!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDavid"

    series of robofab scripts which Erik and Frederik helped me write, and that had
    a c. 98.375% chance of crashing fontlab:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/025lyon-poster_8_5131.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/026lyon-poster_7_5657.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThankfully,
    this is no longer necessary thanks to Mr. Lehni's Scriptographer tool for Illustrator,
    and specifically a script for it called \"Anchorman\". \r\n\r\nOur scripts were
    a tad more interesting for the type designer in that they would generate every
    layer of information (Oncurve points, BCPs, coordinates, hints, and something
    else I forget) for the entire typeface, and <i>as a separate font</i>, but as
    i said, muy crashy...\r\n\r\n(ah, yes, we decided to not show the actual outline,
    but of course that would merely be another layer of the same text block)\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\n--K"
