  has been rendered in - I particularly like the strong terminal ball (I think that's
  what it's called - not a typography expert, I'm afraid) on the J and S.\r\n\r\nAnybody
  know what this might be?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance..."

    some of these are pretty close. Perhaps it's hand drawn typography.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help!"
