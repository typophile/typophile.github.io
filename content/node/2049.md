  body: Really nice one! <BR> <BR>I think there&#39;s legibility problems with the
    tail of the lc &#34;a&#34; &#40;see &#34;ab&#34; &amp; &#34;av&#34;&#41; <BR>And,
    what about a bold version? <BR>

  body: A bold would help sort out the &#39;random-noise-pixel&#39; I see in the current
    rendering.  <BR> <BR>I second the critique of the lowercase &#39;a&#39; - its
    ligature pixel shimmies up the baseline and causes reading damage. Flatten that,
    and give yourself a proper terminal on the &#39;g&#39; and you&#39;ve got a nice
    readable pixel serif. <BR> <BR>but why nitpick when pixel fonts are quirky by
    nature. <BR><a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirinus" target="_blank">http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirinus</a>
