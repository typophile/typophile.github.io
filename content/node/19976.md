body: "Hi there guys:\r\n\r\nI'm interested in (finally) purchasing the Amor families
  (sans and serif) from Storm. However I would like to hear from other users that
  have purchase it. \r\n\r\nDo you ever have problems with the fonts? Like bad kerning
  programing or visual imbalances. How does at smaller point sizes?\r\n\r\nHow do
  you feel about your purchase? \r\n\r\nTell me about things that disappointed and
  tell me about the things that worked better than imagined.\r\n\r\nI want to use
  the font all sort of things from newsletters to correspondence, logos and identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you for helping me,\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey\r\n"

  body: "I'm a huge fan of Frantisek Storm's work that I'm planning a big buy soon
    myself (OTL). But I feel that in some of his types are too gorgeous to be effective
    text faces. Some of the letters of his types are just simply too beautiful or
    eccentric  that they can obstruct long immersive reading and I think Amor Serif
    is one of them. I haven't licenced it but I've downloaded the specimen pdf and
    printed it at 1200dpi, I think it doesn\u2019t read very well when compared to
    classic book types. So that rules out the use of Amor Serif in long texts, magazines
    and conventional books in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAs for the spacing, from my printed
    specimen, it looks like the r can cause problems. \r\n\r\nBTW, I am not an expert
    typographer. I hope someone else with more experience will share their thoughts."

  body: "I recently purchased the library after years of looking at options. I can't
    say I'm on top of it after a few months, but I will venture a few generalizations.\r\n\r\nMany
    of the faces kern fairly tightly. That means some characters may run together,
    like the lc \"r\" and \"t\".\r\n\r\nWhat is amazing to me is comparing the Storm
    versions with the ITC versions on many of the faces. As Geoff says, Storm type
    is colorful in its quirks.\r\n\r\nI think that Amor Sans is dark, which isn't
    bad. The serif has a swirling rythm that can really take hold of you. I feel you
    will end up using the sans to set your long texts if you go this way.\r\n\r\nI
    hope to work with Amor more, but it will take me many years to digest what I have
    on my plate now. Hope that helps a little."

  body: "Geoff Riding> Thanks for the info about the r. \r\n\r\njupiterboy> Thank
    you for your input as well. Very valuable!\r\n\r\nI will probably buy these two
    fonts anyway. 1- because the sans makes an interesting alternative to Myriad or
    Veto and 2- the serif is fabulous at medium to larger sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikey"
