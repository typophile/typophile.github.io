body: "Dear Typohiles,\r\n\r\nWe have been working with a UK Insurance company over
  the last couple years assisting them with  their new brand.  Up until last week,
  they had more or less decided that they were going to implement FF Meta on a corporate
  wide basis.  One of their Marketing team was then sent a TrueType font called Lexus
  Opti.  We compared Lexus Opti with FF Meta, and the resemblance bewtween the two
  typefaces was uncanny. Now I became very suspicious that someone had just basically
  saved Meta and renamed it as Lexus Opti and passed it off as their own design!\r\n\r\nI
  have since learnt that Opti fonts are in fact valid commercial fonts, but they have
  not been updated in the last 15 years, and would not be supported.\r\n\r\nI need
  to come up with some further argument points for our customer, not to go with Lexus,
  but\r\nembrace FF Meta.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please help me with this, with regards
  to the technical unsuitability of the Opti fonts and provide a history of this range
  of Opti typefaces.\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from you\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nNeil\r\nTerrapin

    say \"valid commercial font\" is a stretchable concept, when one considers \r\ntheir
    collection consists largely of rip-offs and pirated designs. I suppose you don't
    buy your Rolex watch from a suspicious street vendor neither. :^)"

  body: "Lexus Opti is probably FF Meta, just renamed. Meta is the corporate font
    for the Lexus brand, and about 18 months ago i made special kerning pairs on behalf
    of the agency's art director in LA. I suppose they paid a license to FSI which
    gives them the right to rename the font. It does not, however, give anyone the
    right to sell the font under this new name. The copy you have is thus a double
    rip-off: someone stole it from Lexus or their agency who have signed a contract
    which only licenses it to them. So Lexus could get sued by FSI, and whoever copied
    the font could be sued both by Lexus and by FSI. \r\n\r\nAnyway: how could you
    even consider using a font for business whose legal provenance you cannot ensure?
    \u201COne of their Marketing team was then sent a TrueType font\u201D - what sort
    of procurement is that? Tell you client to stay away from illegal software, as
    it\u2019ll cost them. Especially now that i know about it."

  body: "\"Go Erik!!! :-)\"\r\n\r\nthank you, and thanks to J\xFCrgen Siebert for
    alerting me to this thread.\r\n\r\nI am surprised \u2013 nay: apalled \u2013 at
    the lack of initiative by some of the designers out there. How difficult can it
    be in the age of Google or myfonts.com to find out the name of the original designer?
    And then write to me directly to get proper facts rather than all sorts of hearsay?
    Not all type designers are dead and you don\u2019t even have to go to the library
    or the bookshelf, like I have to when I do my research for the upcoming new edition
    of the FontBook. It is so easy to find at least the first traces, but you cannot
    rely onn the web entirely, not even on wiki. There\u2019s too much copy-and-pasting
    going on. And mistakes are just as easily copied as true facts. Get a lead, then
    do you own fact checking. Never rely on the first source that comes along. Even
    Myfonts.com just publishes what they come by, and that is not necessarily always
    true. Nobody can double- and treble check all the 30,000 plus fonts out there,
    but at least we try."

    (officially Type Films of Chicago) when their office was downtown (later moved
    to Chicago suburb, still operating at the second location many years later, if
    not still now). They sold everything from metal to film to digital fonts back
    then, virtually all pirated. One story I heard decades ago was how they went about
    pirating Headliners fonts, discovered by employees of the local Headliners franchise
    (The Chicago Franchise Co.). They'd order headlines set as if they were a legitimate
    type shop customer. One day, while setting one of the fonts stored as single character
    films, they realized they had used EVERY character and alternate. So they (Opti)
    were cut off, generally to try to continue as another customer, in Chicago or
    elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs to their digital copies, many are quite badly constructed
    fonts, rescanned and renamed to get around lax US legal restrictions. Regardless
    of how they LOOK, open in a font editor and see that most characters have dozens
    to hundreds of extra points in their outlines, some so bad they'll crash hi res
    RIPs. If you're unfamiliar with the original, the underlying outline drawing is
    probably the best way to determine, barring exact digital dupes, whether you're
    dealing with a pirate or an original foundry or designer. And in the case of OptiFonts,
    another giveaway for some is to be suspicious of font names of locations or stuff
    related to India & S. Asia."
