    as if Underware had a go at a hypothetical quirky <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=auto&id2=overview\">Auto</a>
    Typewriter.\r\nFurthermore, [[Artur Schmal]]\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/parry_family/\">Parry</a>
    comes to my mind. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheticals/quoral/\">Quoral</a>
    has a similar \u2018K\u2019. Some irregular typewriter-like fonts among the suggestions
    in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39935\">this thread</a>.\r\n\r\nF"
