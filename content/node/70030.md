  - things such as \"What did she ..?\" or \"I said, get your filthy ..!\". I couldn't
  find any useful information from the general internets, and it's certainly not a
  kind of ligature ever considered for inclusion into the unicode standard. I also
  couldn't find a thread in the forums here concerning this type of ligature, so my
  question really is: who has thought about these?\r\n\r\nHas anyone ever seen a discussion
  of this ligature in a book or on the internet? I'd love to know what history it
  has.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike \"Pomax\" Kamermans\r\nnihongoresources.com"

  body: "Given that a ligature is simply defined as being a combination of two or
    more characters contracted (or of course, legated) into a single character, it's
    not that odd a question. However, more importantly, note that the CMoS is concerned
    with proper North American practices, which has very little to do with the historical
    use of a character throughout the ages.\r\n\r\nSeveral British people I've asked
    about this noted that they would use \"..?\" rather than a full ellipsis and then
    a question mark, so a natural conclusion is that that practice has to have come
    from somewhere, and this makes it an interesting topic.\r\n\r\nGiven that the
    ellipsis has been around for many centuries, printers and authors throughout the
    ages must have at some point or another decided -even if merely as experiment
    to save ink- to legate the ellipsis with the dot in the question and exclamation
    mark.\r\n\r\nI would like to know how (not) widespread that became and have no
    idea where to start looking, so hopefully people on this forum have some ideas
    on where to start."

  body: "The interrobang is a ligature replacement for ?!, and probably equally unused,
    but people don't seem to have much trouble calling that a ligature or accepting
    its existence in unicode at least. Just because it's not in use now, doesn't mean
    it hasn't been in use in the past, and I am interested in finding out to what
    degree it was used. Making a judgement call on whether there is 'a point' to some
    ligature is a bit silly. There's no point to the ffi ligature other than the aesthetic
    \"it looks good\" and the practical \"it saves lead and ink\". The same would
    go for an ellipsis paired with interpunction that has a dot at its base. It might
    look better, or it might save ink, and the moment either one of those is considered
    valid, there's your point.\r\n\r\nJust to demonstrate that a point is trivially
    attributed: let's say someone is doing a poster design for a play with the title
    \"Did you hear what she... ?\" and decides that for stylistic purposes it would
    be quite nice to make use of the vertical space above the ellipsis by contracting
    the ellipsis and questionmark and reshaping the questionmark curve so that it
    overlaps most of the space above the ellipsis. That is now a ligature. This is
    how they come about.\r\n\r\nNone of the historical ligatures come from committees
    deciding to combine letters, they were invented by typesetters and writers (and
    in some cases, those writers influenced other writers, who in turn ended up influencing
    the entire written language). If one can think of a ligature that looks good,
    voila, one may be born. Just because you could approximate it doesn't mean there
    will never be a point to a \"real\" one; that's up to the minds of the people
    who actually use them.\r\n\r\nBut, we all digress, as that wasn't the point of
    this thread - it was primarily about getting pointers on where to look in order
    to find some kind of history of ellipsis ligatures, or at least a discussion of
    the use of \"..?\" and \"..!\" (or as texnic points out for Russian, \"?..\" and
    \"!..\")\r\n\r\nSo please, no more replies in the form of \"it's a silly ligature\"
    or \"why would you use it\", that is irrelevant. Does anyone know of a documented
    history of this stylistic choice?"

    a ligature is a combination of two or more characters represented by a single
    <em>glyph.</em>\r\n\r\nAn ellipsis mark consists of three dots, either by themselves...
    or followed by a fourth dot or other punctuation if they occur at the end of a

    an end-of-sentence period (resulting in four periods). Use four only when the
    words on either side of the ellipsis make full sentences. You should <strong>never
    use fewer than three nor more than four periods</strong>, with only a single exception:

  body: Most of the time, I make the ellipsis dots the same size as the full stop
    (period). In display types, I might make them slightly smaller, and also more
    tightly spaced. In text type, I prefer quite loose spacing of ellipsis dots, since
    if they are too tight they look like a grey line. I set the left sidebearing to
    be the same as that of the period, and I set the right sidebearing so that a period
    after the ellipsis is the same distance from the third dot as the ellipsis dots
    are from each other.
