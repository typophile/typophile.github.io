…or it doesn&rsquo;t, especially nowadays. When people don&rsquo;t write by hand every day and all the time, I don&rsquo;t really see how some &ldquo;signal&rdquo; of their personality (assuming there can be such a thing to begin with), in their handwriting, wouldn&rsquo;t be drowned out by the noise caused by troubled technique, and lack of practice. 
Like, I know a bunch of people in computer jobs who all have similarly horrid, inconsistent, and illegible handwriting, while they&rsquo;re vastly different people/characters. What unites them is, they don&rsquo;t usually hand-write.</div>

I realy dont think that it can get better with practice, or maybe it can when your still younger, as long as you dont have to rush! Who knows?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In grade two, when we started to learn cursive writing instead of printing, mine was so bad that my teachers stopped asking me to try and just go back to printing. My dad printed in caps, and of course I wanted to be just like dad, so from then on, I printed in capital letters. After a while, (20 years) it got to a point that it was so messy that I couldn&rsquo;t read my own notes half of the time.</p>
<p>I had always known about the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouma|Bouma]] model, so I decided to try an experiment.</p>
<p>So there I was, 20something years old, sitting on my deck in downtown Toronto with a stack of printouts with dashed lines on them and I literally practiced drawing a sheet of letter a&rsquo;s, then b&rsquo;s, then c'&lsquo;s… I did this for a little less than a week, and then simply forced myself to print in U&amp;lc. It took about six months - one year to become comfortable with it, but once I had made the transition I noticed that I could go about 2x faster, have letters that were almost 2x messier, but due to the fact that I now had word-shapes that weren&rsquo;t there when printing in all caps, I could read it 2x as easily. It&rsquo;s still pretty bad though.</p>
<p>Even more interesting, the day following a seizure, my handwriting is bad beyond belief. If I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve had a seizure in my sleep, my handwriting the next day is often a give-away. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a PhD thesis in there somewhere.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting topic, one I&rsquo;ve always wondered about.</p>
<p>I pretty much learned to type so that others could read my writing. When I do write it is more of a shorthand notation. You could not understand the individual words without the greater context. I think I learned that from my dad. When I do try to slow down and write legibly it usually comes out mixEd cAsE and I tend to run out of room on the right side of the sheet.</p>
<p>And as far as content (like my graphic design) I usually need to spew it all out on the sheet then cut/paste/move it into some sort of logical order. Hard to do when it&rsquo;s hand written.</p>
<p>&hellip;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not the only one :-)</p>

And any letters that have similar adjacent strokes I sometimes merge together. The word &ldquo;walk&rdquo; would have w, a, l, and then I&rsquo;d use the vertical from the l for the k.

<p>Have you noticed that the doctors always write their handwriting sloppiness off to the harried pace.

Told him I hoped that he was practicing his handwriting while I was waiting, otherwise I was going to start billing him for waiting time.</p>

<p>Until I made a TTF out of it.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s my most downloaded font ever and I keep getting e-mails asking permission to use it.</p>

<p>I certainly liked <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my<!-- raw HTML omitted --> dad&rsquo;s handwriting too; he was not hugely educated, nor particularly interested in &ldquo;calligraphy&rdquo;, but just brought up in a time when kids were taught to write &ldquo;properly&rdquo; more than they have been lately, I suppose&hellip;</p>

<p>Cathy, my grandfather and my father had very similar handwriting, i find them beautifull, yet had totally diferent education levels, and they both also have some drawing skills. My mother has one of those rounded, huge, handwritings. Both my parents are primaryschool teachers, and their handwritings are not, by far, a reflex of what they teach at school :P
I think i was influenced by my father&rsquo;s, i always tried to copy it&hellip; in the end, with no success, as you can see above, some say :P
i&rsquo;ll try to find some examples to show you :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;graphology is to graphic design what phrenology is to neurology&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually been gathering research and books on graphology. Neurology as well, but that&rsquo;s another topic.</p>
<p>I run the risk of being stoned to death for supporting quackery, but mind you, handwriting analysis is respected in Europe, less so in the United States, and if for nothing provides an interesting and often times amusing take on letterforms from outside my profession.</p>
<p>Antiquated systems of interpretation and description have their merits in the over all scheme of everything. It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago that designers were seriously trying to find the corresponding geometric shapes for the colors red, blue, and yellow.</p>

<p>My scribbly hand printing was the basis of nearly the second font I made, which I released for free and of those early works is the most popular. Even had requests for embedding licenses, and seen it pop up places I wasn&rsquo;t told about.</p>
<p>Working on polishing it up with an expanded character set for a pay release.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, I do have that book, although I cannot say I have read through it.</p>
<p>I have a whole stack of graphology books waiting for a rainy weekend, but the one that gives a nice general historical view of the differing schools of graphology is the recently published The Definitive Book of Handwriting Analysis: The Complete Guide to Interpreting Personalities, Detecting Forgeries, and Revealing Brain Activity through the Science of Graphology by Marc Seifer.</p>
<p>I cringe at the words Definitive, Complete, and Science in the title.</p>
<p>No, I am not a new age freak burning scented candles in my isolation room.</p>
