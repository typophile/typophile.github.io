  making business.\r\n\r\nIt's the first time I've used Mrs Eaves as a typeface so
  I wanted some clarifications on the usage:\r\n\r\nOn the business card, I've used
  Mrs Eaves Small Caps for most of the text (except Roman for one line) however it
  seems the numbers are a lot smaller than the rest of the letters and the brackets
  a lot bigger, I've had to make the brackets two point sizes smaller. Is this what
  I should be doing?\r\n\r\nAlso when is the right time to use petite caps? And I
  wish there was a bold small caps :(\r\n\r\nIn general, any feedback would also be
  appreciated. It's my first post on here but I want as much criticism as I can get
  so don't hold back.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nJacob"

    in running copy or to establish a hierarchy. \r\n\r\n\u2022 It feels more like
    haughty clothes for older women than creative couture. This is a combination of
    the monogram, only using a single color, type choices, and overuse of caps all
    combining into something stuffy. \r\n\u2022 The use of bullets in \u201D\u2022
    LORRI \u2022 C\u201C feels unbalanced within your compositions.\r\n\u2022 The
    connection between the letters in the monogram looks bad and is not necessary.
    If you really want letters like this to connect in that way, draw them. \r\n\u2022

    You\u2019re resorting to gimmickry with the ampersand and all-lowercase. That
    makes the script, the small caps, and the monogram feel like gimmicks as well.\r\n\u2022
    Go easy on the small caps. They don\u2019t harmonize well with the figures the
    LORRIC set in caps all over the place gets monotonous. "

    \r\n\r\nIt feels more like a wedding consultant or a wedding cake maker to me.
    Excessive cursive is pretty much a de facto cliche standard for this sort of a
    business."
