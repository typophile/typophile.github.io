  trying to identify the fonts used here.\r\n\r\nMy first thought, with the exception
  of the <strong>e</strong>, is that the font looked like Caslon 224. I have placed
  the font ITC Caslon 224 (in gray) below the type for the logo. Although Caslon 224
  is close it does not match the serifs on the <strong>T</strong> arm nor does it
  match the counters of the <strong>P</strong> and <strong>R</strong> and the <strong>K</strong>
  is close except it seems condensed as compared to the original. The <strong>O</strong>
  is a very close match\r\n\r\nI think the <strong>e</strong> is ITC Tiffany but not
  sure and I have no idea what was used for the dash and the comma.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts
  would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nBill\r\n"

    rest seem to match. The dash is a Tilde rather than a Dash\r\n(maybe hand-drawn?)."

  body: "Thank you,\r\n\r\nI had considered the idea that the entire phrase was ITC
    Tiffany but when I looking at Tiffany in my font book I was thrown by the spur
    in the counter of the <strong>R</strong> or on the <strong>K</strong>.\r\n\r\nFor
    some reason the idea that the <strong>P</strong> and <strong>K</strong> were modified
    did register deep enough.\r\n\r\nAnyway that is why having access to a fresh set
    of eyes and thinking is a great resource \u2014 to point out the obvious.\r\n\r\nThank
    you,\r\n\r\nBill"

    my eye picked up on the Caslon 224 style.\r\n\r\nI have Caslon 224 and have used
    it on many project but I'll have to go out and purchase Tiffany.\r\n\r\nThank
    you,\r\n\r\nBill"
