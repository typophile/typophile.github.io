body: "Allow me to preface this post by mentioning that the logo I currently use was
  concepted about five years ago when I just began working with online media. At the
  time, I had just started using my 'Xenethyl' alias and wanted to design a logo for
  myself. Looking around at other icons, I found myself very drawn to Eidos' Hitman
  logo (as many of you gamers will likely realize).\r\n\r\nSince the original drafting
  of my logo I have progressed to the point where I now do freelance graphic and web
  work as a hobby under Xen Graphics Studios. The name comes partly from my online
  alias and partly from a play on the word 'zen.'\r\n\r\nMy backstory aside, I'm wondering
  if I may have taken too many visual cues from the Hitman logo in my personal design.
  If it's not readily apparent, my logo is supposed to represent a stylized 'X,' which,
  sliced in half, plays somewhat on the idea of zen and balance.\r\n\r\nOver the years
  I have really become attached to the original design, though in recent months I
  have felt the need to update it and make the curves and weighting a bit more balanced
  and professional-looking. At the same time, as I have become more involved in the
  graphic world I have gained an immensely high level of respect for designers and
  artists. That being said, the last thing I want to do is blatantly rip off Eidos'
  hard work.\r\n\r\nWhat do you all think? Was I too inspired by the Hitman logo in
  searching for my own branding? Links to the Hitman logo, my current logo and revision
  mock-ups, and my proposed final revision can be found below. Just to be clear, the
  updated logo I am looking to implement is the third link.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.xengraphics.net/misc/hitman_logo.gif|Eidos'

  body: Seconded. Maybe try to pick up on some of the heavy contrast between curves
    and sharp angles, thin and fat, but pull it more towards a readable X?

  body: "dezcom - I agree, brand confusion is not something that I want to deal with.\r\n\r\npica
    pusher - I think moving in a direction that makes the logo more easily distinguishable
    as an 'X' would be a good idea. It would at least allow me to continue using the
    same style.\r\n\r\nvintagesignman - Thanks for the mock-up! I'll see if I can
    play with the design a bit and move it more towards a recognizable 'X.'\r\n\r\nTiffany
    - I hadn't considered the logo being faction-like, though I definitely agree with
    you. Maybe it was a sub-conscious thing...\r\n\r\nTrick - I too started to notice
    that while I was looking over the different variations. I think slicing the icon
    in half helps to reduce the mask imagery, but maybe a little more treatment wouldn't
    hurt either.\r\n\r\nThanks to all of you that have posted your comments regarding
    this design. I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI'll start working on some revisions
    and see if I can't make this logo be more unique and recognizable."
