  body: I was going to say Avant Garde but it's not. Then I wondered if it might be
    [[http://www.christianschwartz.com/graphik.shtml|Graphik]] but it's not available
    for licensing yet(at least on the website) I'm stumped..unless this image is from
    Wallpaper??

  body: "I'd suspect this is custom, or at least not one of the \"big\" fonts.* There
    seems to be some missing / strangely handled optical correction: the \"O\" seems
    to be a perfect circle, and the counters of the \"B\" look like they're vertically
    centered mathematically.\r\n\r\n* Prove me wrong!"

    I wish there was a way to fix the kerning on this poster. It'd be much nicer\u2026"
