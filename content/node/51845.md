  Apparel website (not Helvetica, for once) It looks to me like a cross between Serif
  Gothic and something like Futura. It has the black gothic feel and has these little
  serifs as well. It also reminds me of horror movie posters from the 80's (Halloween
  maybe?) Any help would really be apreciated!\r\n\r\nthanks! \r\n\r\nDarby[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontidaa_3526.jpg]"

    fonts to the image or to serif gothic (in the sense that it is a black gothic
    face with small serifs) I'd love to hear them. \r\n\r\nThanks Lex. "
