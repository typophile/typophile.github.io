  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, I&rsquo;m just starting my final major project in my art and design course at college and I&rsquo;m at a blank for ideas. Everyones work is gong to be put up for exhibition in a few months time and I would really like to do something that is eye catching and interesting even to people that don&rsquo;t really have an interest in typography. If anybody could give me some ideas it would be greatly appreciated as I&rsquo;m really struggling and I&rsquo;ve got to send off a statement of intent in a few days. Thankyou in advance to anyone that replies.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">sorry I dont think I explained myself properly. In reply to kidcranium, I am interested in typography but I&rsquo;m doing an art and design course, so people who look at the work wont neccesarily have an interest in typography. Also I&rsquo;m looking for a project that uses type, a poster for instance, or making pictures with type, more along the graphic design\text art idea but im struggling for a subject matter.Heres some links and images of pieces I&rsquo;ve found interesting(all from deviant art users) but I think I&rsquo;ve been looking at so many mages my brains mashed.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tatemze,</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to what your teacher says, because obviously he hasn&rsquo;t a clue. Your subject matter will ultimately determine what your design becomes.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find inspiration in the most unlikely places. Take a walk and observe your surroundings, look to literature, go to the library and read up on a subject unrelated to typography or design. Look at images of nebulas, sports cars and architecture. All of these things can create a spark that may lead your imagination in the right direction.</p>
<p>Is there a message you want to convey? Something you feel strongly about? Start with politics perhaps, after all, don&rsquo;t students always have some sort of opinion or cause they want to fight for? ;)</p>
<p>Begin with a strong statement that you can use as your foundation [typographically as well as conceptually] and it may help you focus on where you&rsquo;ll want to start your search for inspiration.</p>

<p>Not bad, for example your &ldquo;pseudo subject&rdquo; would be an orange or a refrigerator or a horse. You could illustrate, talk, photograph, etc. this subject in &ldquo;100 styles&rdquo;. You decide on one and get deep with this style. Show how you can transform your pseudo-object  to this certain style you&rsquo;ve choosen (do you know what i&rsquo;m trying to say?).
Say you go the russian constructivist way, get informed about the original stuff /its history, the followers/new interpreters and what can come out now of this &ldquo;genre and your orange&rdquo; from your own skills.</p>

<p>I noticed you said you would like to do a poster of some kind. I know in london, and all over the world there is a big problem at the moment with people carrying weapons to course harm to others. How about an Ad campaign to stop people carrying weapons.</p>
<p>You could play on typographic treatment. In a real sense your design could save life&rsquo;s, and of course will be good for the old portfolio to show that you have addressed real life issue through design.</p>
