  palette (like Indesign has had for years now), but until then how do I get to this
  character?"

    the original post a bit better...]\r\n\r\nMay be a bit heretical to suggest this:
    but unless the font is something particularly unusual, are you able to insert
    a multiplication sign out of another - more standard - font? (after all, it's
    not the most, er, characterful of characters)\r\n\r\nEver since I chose to block
    pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working."
