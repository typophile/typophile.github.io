body: "A customer gave me an old tape from a '70's era IBM typesetting machine. She
  remembered the font as \"Liberty\". I can't find it anywhere. It's a nice, freehand
  looking script font. I hope I can find a digital font somewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJohn"

    Mediaeval Italic</a>, but the caps are different. Maybe alternates?
