  body: "The \"LAGUNA\" letters look like FHWA Series Gothic F. The \"1600\" numerals
    look like the \"D\" weight in Series Gothic (or what many refer to as \"highway
    gothic\"). I have no clue on the Asian type.\r\n\r\nInterstate looks similar to
    FHWA Series Gothic, but its letterforms have been modified in subtle ways to make
    it more attractive looking. The metrics of FB Interstate have also been tightened
    for print-based use. It does not have the spacing tables of a roadway face."
