  body: "I'm seeing way too much going on here. Six levels of headlines in two typefaces
    and three colors, two kinds of pullouts, transparent floating captions, and lines
    of Chevrons. You've got a lot of good stuff going on, it's just going on a little
    too thick. Try turning the volume down a little and let the great photos do more
    of the work.\r\n\r\nAlso, be careful with your gradients and shadows. You've got
    them lit from below, it's emphasizing the top heavy layouts and destabilizing
    the pages."

  body: This is an improvement over the red, for sure. I'm not loving the pullquotes
    in boxes - I think you have enough boxes already and they could use some air,
    did you try just brown type within the white space?
