    Greek face so im going to have to &#34;dress a Roman like a Greek&#34; as you
    said on one of these posts. ;&#41; <BR>But its the feel of the face im after.
    &#39;Weathered by time&#39; sort of look. I was going to do some research and
    draw the logotype myself, but was wondering if there were any faces like this

  body: ' If you want to be culturally authentic, you might have a tough time, since
    &#34;Hellenicized&#34; Latin fonts are pretty rare, so a specifically weathered
    one might not exist. One reason not to worry too much about authenticity in this
    case is that people might -understandably- not even have the sensitivity to realize
    what it is! Collective memory &#40;in the West&#41; doesn&#39;t seem to extend
    to anything before the Roman Empire, I mean in terms of noticing if it&#39;s authentic
    or not. Just use Democratica...  ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>You could go Bizantine and use
    Sophia. Or you could use a less-familiar Roman style &#40;like Herculanum&#41;
    and pretend. Or you could take something like Skia and weather it yourself. Or
    you could wait for Gerry to give a much more qualified answer.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: Hi George, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the info.  <BR>I dont know how this is going
    to work, but im going to try and merge the Latin &amp; Greek to &#39;create&#39;
    the feel of antiquity. <BR> <BR>I only have to get a combo of S, P, A, R, T &amp;
    N. Maybe hint at a bridge &#40;is that the right term?&#41; on the &#34;A&#34;?
    The Greek &#34;R&#34; is a Latin &#34;P&#34; thats going to be tricky because
    I use both. &#34;S&#34; will <B>have</B> to be Latin, same with the &#34;T&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Bren

    <BR> <BR>Sounds like a plan. Fortunately it&#39;s a logotype - a font would be
    a whole different story. <BR> <BR>S: What about an h-flipped &#34;Z&#34;? That
    would look like a Greek Sigma. <BR>P, R: Keep them open? <BR>A: Try a chevron
    bar. <BR>T: Tough one. Making it a cross is an obvious answer, except the Ancient
    Greeks were pagan. <BR>N: Do something funky.  <BR> <BR>BTW, you could look at
    Barnbrook&#39;s Mason and Exocet for inspiration. And maybe Trajic notRoman: <BR><A

    <BR>But please don&#39;t ask for a copy. <BR> <BR>Overall: make things not very
    aligned; maybe flare the stroke endings. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Hrant! you were holding out on me! ;&#41; <BR> <BR>That face you have is a
    perfect refrence! The P and R are fantastic. I see how you have tried to combine
    the S. <BR> <BR>S is tricky because &#40;I feel&#41; its about recognition. Since
    that is the first letter it has to have some sort of flow to lead you in &#40;or
    am I being pedantic?&#41;. I agree a h-flipped S would look more authentic...
    lets see what happens ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I also had thoughts about keeping the P
    &amp; R open. I was just looking at Palatino, maybe I&#39;ll funk them up similarly.
    <BR>As for the A, I could use a lowercase:<B>a</B> <BR> <BR>need to think now.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Bren
