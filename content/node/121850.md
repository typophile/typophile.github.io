  working on a graphic novel, or actually it\u2019s more like a \u2018graphic bio\u2019
  \u2013 a biography in the form of a picture book. \r\n\r\nIn the book, there are
  3-4 different kinds/lines of text  \u2013 the narrator\u2019s voice, my main character\u2019s
  voice \u2013 and then excerpts from letters, song texts and poems, written for and
  by my main character.\r\nThe 3 different kinds of text change a lot throughout the
  book, so that I sometimes will have all three kinds on one page or spread. Every
  page is illustrated and sometimes text is set on top of a drawing.\r\n\r\nThe two
  first kinds of text, the narrator and my main character, I think would work with
  quite many different typefaces, \r\nMy story takes place mostly in the 1960-1980s,
  when my character was young \u2013 in a  beatnik-/alternative surrounding. I\u2019d
  like the typeface for her and the narrator\u2019s voice to have some warmth, but
  without attracting too much attention to itself. Maybe slightly handwritten and/or
  casual.\r\nFor now, I am leaning towards Cronos, and earlier I\u2019ve looked at
  Joanna, Perpetua or Legacy Sans.\r\n\r\nBut, but, but: the letter/poem-texts are
  causing me a head ache! The only thing that I think really works for them, is using
  a \u201Coldschool-typewriter\u201D-face (like \u201CPitch\u201D.) One with a vintage-typewriter-feel.\r\nBut
  I don't think the typewriter-face doesn't mix very well with any of the above mentioned.
  The shapes, perhaps, but also when  combined with a typewriter face, they look a
  little (too) formal.\r\nI looked at Nexus and Eureka, which both have a monotype-version,
  that I thought of using in stead of vintage- typewriter-type, but I think those
  monotypes look too contemporary for my book. Sigh.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?
  Do you have any ideas or suggestions?\r\n\r\nI know this is the kind of thing you
  should discuss with a colleague, while having a coffee \u2013 but I don\u2019t have
  that person right now. So \u2013 if anyone has thoughts,  opinions or suggestions
  on this, it will be very much appreciated! Thanks so much!"

  body: "It depends on how much \u201Cgraphic\u201D and how much \u201Cnovel\u201D
    the result: if the typewritten text is visually framed, it shouldn\u2019t clash
    with the rest.\r\nIf that is the case, I would go for an accurate rendition either
    historically  (which model of typewriter?) and/or visually (a \u201Cworn out\u201D
    face, like http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/trixie).\r\nIf the lines (pun intended)
    between the different kind of text are more blurred, you could use either a classic
    text face with a monospaced cut (like Century) or a proportionally spaced typewriter
    face (like the ones suggested in the aforelinked thread or http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/lekton).\r\nAbout
    the text faces you mention, I\u2019m most familiar with Perpetua, and I wouldn\u2019t
    recommend it, finding it a bit \u201Cfrail\u201D and maybe even pretentious."

    back then and most young folks didn't use them except maybe in upper-class schools,
    for college term papers, and office work. And it's harder to imagine a beatnik
    or hippie using one. You might need to include an explanation of why they are
    using it."

  body: "Thank you very much for your answers and for pointing me to the older typewriter-discussion.
    I'll take a closer look at Triplicate.\r\n\r\n@ James: they did use typewriters
    \u2013 but also a lot of handwriting. I'm reluctant to post text and illustrations
    from the book, as it is not yet approved, but I can share with you a little piece
    of sixties typewriting: several little notes like this one,  \"just left - will
    be back later\"-sort of notes, survived all these years and I feature some of
    them in the book. They feels like text messages from 50 years ago.\r\n@ riccard0:
    yes. The lines are blurred \u2013 and the texts not always visually separated.
    Century \u2013 that might work!\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_sixities_typrewriter_5836.jpg]"

    agree. I'm just saying it's not like today when everyone has a computer. Many
    folks didn't even own a typewriter. I was the editor of a newsletter in the 1970s
    and almost all submissions were handwritten.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that typewriting
    is a bad idea. I'm just saying that you might want to mention why a beatnik is
    using one."

  body: "@ James, they did a lot of writing in her \"group\". They published a magazine.\r\nAnd
    both her parents were writers. You mentioned social class, and when they met in
    the 1940, her mother, who came from a middle class family, owned a typewriter,
    while her father, coming from a working class background, didn't. Her's was an
    Erica/Erika \u2013 I know that.\r\n@ Nick \u2013  I like it Brown. It's has this
    slight vintage-tint.  I like it. And nice story about WEC. \r\nIt's hard to make
    the  typewriter-/monospace/slab work with a serif, so I think it must be a sans.
    Brown could mix nicely, I think. If anything, perhaps I could use something a
    little more ...casual, perhaps. But it is a good suggestion."
