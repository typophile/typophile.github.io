body: "[[Erik Spiekermann]], [[Christian Schwartz]], 2003\r\n\r\nFollowing the success
  of his most popular typeface [[FF Meta]], Erik Spiekermann worked with Christian
  Schwartz to release [[FF Unit]] in 2003. The key challenge was creating a new typeface
  that would have enough character to distinguish itself without calling too much
  attention. It would need to be legible at small sizes, but with heavy weights for
  headlines. \r\n\r\nErik describes the differences between FF Meta and FF Unit: \"FF
  Unit is the grown-up, no-nonsense sister of FF Meta. With FF Unit, puppy fat is
  off, some curves are gone and the shapes are tighter. While FF Meta has always been
  a little out-of-line and not exactly an over-engineered typeface, FF Unit is less
  outspoken and more disciplined. It is -- like FF Meta -- very suitable for use quite
  small and large, but FF Unit lacks some of the diagonal strokes and curves that
  give FF Meta its slight informality. However, FF Unit is not cold or uptight, just
  cool: no redundant ornamentation, just a lot of character. The tighter shapes make
  it suitable for big headlines set tight. Smaller sizes benefit from the increased
  contrast between vertical and horizontal strokes and open spacing.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>External
