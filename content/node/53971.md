  They used letracet, and didn\xB4t always have the entire complete sheets, wich is
  why it ended up with a lower case \"n\".\r\n\r\nDoes anyone recognize the font,
  does it exist anymore?\r\nI\xB4ve already tried identyfont - the closest I came
  was Phosphate and Phosphor.\r\nI could always add the white lines to a solid font,
  but still...anyone recognize this one?\r\n\r\n[[http://fbimg.no.publicus.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Avis=FB&Dato=20071018&Kategori=SPEILET&Lopenr=710180013&Ref=AR&MaxW=280&NoBorder]]"
