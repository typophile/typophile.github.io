  school, but some only through experience. A dear friend of mine regularly violates
  the following:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Do not include specific religious symbols unless
  the business or product has a specifically religious nature or clientele. \r\n<li>Do
  not include photos of hot chicks, unless the product is intended for use by, or
  are in themselves, hot chicks, or you intend to imply the customer's enhanced sexual
  attraction by association with the product.\r\n<li>It is not necessary to display
  all the products in the business's catalog on the first page of the ad.\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nI
  swear If I see one more ad for industrial water pumps with a Jesus fish and three
  bikini clad babes amongst hundreds of tiny pumps, with the copy lettered in Comic
  Sans and five other fonts, I think I might stab something.\r\n\r\nAre there any
  other rules you would add to the list?"

    over by low-class advertising. If Head-On taught me anything, it\u2019s that a
    commercial need not be slick, expensive, or well-produced, it just needs to get
    attention. When one\u2019s target audience chews tobacco, watches Nascar, and
    reads Hustler just make an ad with a hot chick, an American flag, and the phrase
    \u201DGod Bless America.\u201D Then promptly cash the check and move on. Good
    design need not be pretty if something quick and dirty can get the job done."
