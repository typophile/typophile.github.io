    the work of Rainer Zenz for palm screens. The &#34;microfonts&#34; tend towards

    lower than 7 pixels high the solution is greyscaling. Bitsream made this: <A HREF="http://www.bitstream.com/wireless/index.html"

  body: ' Mr. Cadars  <BR> <BR>I saw the links, and i think that is too easy to say
    the similities between some fonts are at the same goal,&#40; i told you `cause
    i make a mistake in the pass week critique another font, but saying that was a
    posible piracy case..&#41;  cause this family proposes a complete set and variations
    and the concept behind the screen pitch size is a matter to resolve by people
    many people not only for bitstram team, or me, don`t you think?- It`s only a opinion
    but i think that this critique forum is a great oportunity to coperate between
    typographic design proyects, and more than comparations between designers the
    deal is to make GRAPHIC examples for the success of many of the proyects. <BR>
    <BR>Can be more especific please <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> <BR>&#40; how many fonts, a detail, all are the same, etc...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Miguel. '

  body: ' Heeyah Miguel! <BR>I wasn&#39;t speaking about piracy or something like
    this! Everybody here agree saying that when somebody design small bitmap fonts
    have the same problems as his neighbour. <BR>Therefore, I&#39;m a bad-english
    speaker, and I know now that &#34;matter&#34; doesn&#39;t means &#34;problem&#34;:
    I said &#34;pitch size&#34; because I&#39;ve seen the Minority font on a 1280/1024px
    screen, and to my mind it can&#39;t work with a resolution greater than 800/600px.
    I work designing fonts for cellular phone screens and most of the constructors
    include a zoom mode on their products cause they&#39;re happy to announce that
    they can display 6 lines of text, but many users can&#39;t read them. That&#39;s
    why I&#39;ve send this palm microfonts link. They can be legible because palm
    display got a big pixel size, bigger than I-mode phones. <BR>Making the smallest
    font means &#34;making the last legible size&#34; and gain place to display more
    lines on screen, or it&#39;s only a challenge? <BR>BTW, I really prefer your bold
    version. Do you have a full character set of this one? <BR> <BR>Cheers <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
