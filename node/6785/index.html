		<div class="commentbody">that's what threw me for a loop, i thought it was &quot;bar&quot; but i guess they didn't really teach us that word at BYU. ;^) Most definately that's a hard sign and it appears that this is &quot;Fyodor's Bar&quot; (something about the stress on the E makes it become a YO, morphology was a long time ago!) i'm thinking this must be old lettering because modern grammar would give us &quot;BAR FEDRA&quot; (with an A at the end instead of a hard sign, but instead we get &quot;BAR FEDORUH&quot; where the hard sign actually gives the UH sound. Now that i've written all this someone who actually speaks russian is going to come clear all this up for you, hrant! ;^)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The lettering posted by Hrant Papazian shows the shapes of some heavily stylised initials that <i>may</i> be traced to the 17th century. Frankly, it has as much in common with the Cyrillic lettering/typographic tradition as the signs of the Irish pubs in The Bronx have with the Book of Kells. One should be wary not to mistake such cheap pieces for the fount of knowledge about the Cyrillic letter-forms, let alone not to draw any hasty conclusions with regard to the Russian lettering conventions. <BR> <BR>The second letter in the first line is the <a href="http://www.palmira.net/arts/nlr/images/high/primer.jpg" target="_blank">A</a>, not the <a href="http://www.edu.ru/files/pics/68.jpg" target="_blank">YA</a>. The YA originated as a digraph I-A but later lost its first part (I-), so the construction of the present-day YA is indeed a variation on the shape of the olden-day A. <BR> <BR>The Z+b thing at the end of the bottom line is the hard sign (<a href="http://www.pravoslavie.ru/sas/image/bukvar.jpg" target="_blank">YER</a>). Its early forms sometimes featured that slanted stem. The YER is used here to make the whole thing feel &quot;antique&quot;. The reason being, the usage of the final YER (after the consonnants) was abolished long time ago, in 1918. The presence, or the absence of the final YER changes nothing in the pronunciation of the words. Of course, logically, the word &quot;BAR&quot; (the top line) should end in the same way. This hard-sign spelling trick is as popular&ndash;and as credible&ndash;as the fake antique spelling like &quot;Ye Olde Booze Shoppe&quot;.  <BR> <BR>As to the FEDOR/FYODOR spelling, the sound YO in Russian is expressed with the &quot;E diaeresis&quot; (Umlaut, tr</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the insights. I guess a sign for a bar can rarely be culturally very &quot;pure&quot;. The YER business is especially amusing. It's fascinating though that the pre-Petrine &quot;A&quot; essentially survived via a truncated YA, while it didn't in its lone form. <BR> <BR>&gt; The YA originated as a digraph I-A but later lost its first part <BR> <BR>I guess the YA (I + O, graphically) never lost its elements? BTW, Cyrillic has so many letters based on or around the &quot;y&quot; sound - it's interesting to consider why. <BR> <BR>And about the YO: is there also a convention to make it curly (like in that sign) when you drop the diaeresis - or is that just another affectation? <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

You already know that the <b>YA</b> (see above) looks like the inverted <b>R</b>. It appears that the <b>YU</b> originated as a trigraph: <b>I</b>-<b>O</b>-<b>Y</b>. Of course, the <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/images/writing/ocslavonic.gif" target="_blank"><b>OY</b></a> (OU) combo was borrowed by St. Cyril from his mother script&ndash;Greek.

		<div class="commentbody">Looks constructivist. Which reminds me to point something out: in the west there's all this talk about the socialist constructivist style, all those famous Russian designers of the 20th century, etc. Well, on the actual streets of Moscow and Novosibirsk there's virtually none of that, only a tiny bit in some logos* and posters. It seems that style has made little impact on the stuff most people see on a daily basis - it just never really clicked** - it seems basically like a museum curiosity more than anything else, but you never read that reality in design books&hellip; <BR> <BR>* Maybe logos done by westerners.  :-/ <BR> <BR>** I attribute that to the Russian desire for decoration. And they do such a wonderful job of it - you see all these details in places small and large where somebody has wanted to express decoration. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To answer the original question, both samples are definitely old-style, the first looking more like older books, and the second is quite typical iconic or church-style. The second one is rather common in religious books, has a few digital implementations. The first one is for sure handmade and quite craftily so. <BR> <BR>As for legibility, the funky A and D are only clear in a context. They are quite cleverly stylized, the Ya-looking A maybe even mimicked after an actual old sample (letter Ya was introduced later than A, so in absence of it, an A looking like this would raise no questions). But as standalone letters they are hardly identifiable. <BR> <BR>As for Z-looking E, this is the way all children are taught at school to handwrite the capital E. And yes, the last one is a hard sign - I like the slanting as it saves space making the letter more compact, fitting in a rectangle. Hard sign by the look, but in fact this is an abandoned in post-revolutionary reform letter Yat' (or Yeru in some literature), that read &quot;ye&quot; in some combinations and was silent in others, like here. Which is exactly the reason it was left behind. It looked liked a hard sign, but could have an extra downward stroke at the end of leftmost horizontal element. <BR> <BR>I have to disappoint you on the bar's name: it really is Fyodor, but it's a Russian version of Theodor - hardly a good idea for a women's bar<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>) The E is actually Yo - the dieresis is almost extinct, it's considered bad taste in professional publishing, although some type purists insist on Yo's revival. There's even a graphic design studio with a provocative name Yo-programma. <BR> <BR>Sorry some of this doubles Maxim's reply - I was lazy to rewrite when I saw it<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>And the racing poster is based on 20-30s constructivist designs.

My two guesses are that it actually improves legibility and that there was no Yo key on typewriters. <BR> <BR>Paul, I can think of examples of Ye becoming Yo, but here's an interesting fact: when present in any word, Yo is always the stressed vowel. No exceptions - and that in a language without any stress logic! So there's really no need for extra stress marks here. Although I wish we had them other than in schoolbooks - so many Russians mispronounce the stresses!

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, simpler characters make readng faster, don't they? And I can't really think of any pair of words that would spell the same while one means Yo and another Ye. So the reader's hardly ever in doubt. A nightmare for foreign students, I heard. Just one problem with this: many people may first see a rare Yo-word in writing with Ye, and start pronouncing it with Ye, but that's something to deal with at school, like they do with silent consonants in, say, soLntse. <BR> <BR>And stressing is a funny issue. Paul, I honestly haven't heard of any formal stressing rules - this whole business changes so much even from region to region&hellip; As for the antepenultimate syllable - doesn't this call for at least 3 syllables in word? And two immediate counterexamples: korOva (a cow), molokO (milk). There's also everyone's favorite bAbushka (a grandmother) that fits your rule fine, but foreigners tend to mispronounce with stress on the second syllable. The thing is, we have lots of prefixes, suffixes and endings, and in nouns the stress often stays on the root, in verbs it usually doesn't and there's a million other cases making it impossble to formalize. How many languages have you heard of that have some 400-pages stressing dictionaries (much overlooked by TV and radio announcers btw)? Besides, language changes - this dictionary has been reissued 8 times since 1960! Correct usage of stresses is one of little classy etiquette things over here, like holding your chopsticks farther from the picking end in Japan or knowing your silverware rules in European tradition. I guess there might be a key to formalization, but the total number of rules would make them impossible to learn anyway<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Yet, for an everyday speaker the logic is graspable - otherwise weird thing like changing stresses in foreign names wouldn't happen. How would like NewtOn and RutherfOrd?<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> You'd hear this a lot over here<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>
