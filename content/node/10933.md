  alt="untitled"> <BR> <BR>I basically want/need an alternative to the standard verdana-esque
  screen fonts that I use frequently in my client work - the problem is making it
  stand apart, but keeping it just as readable! <BR> <BR>so any advice or criticism
  &#40;and maybe even a name suggestion or two&#41; would be appreciated.'

  body: Looks sharp! <BR> <BR>It&#39;s hard to find a name for a generic bitmap font...
    Just avoid ending it with an &#34;a&#34;.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Andrew - The Regular is as readable as Verdana, yet  <BR>stylisticallly unique.
    You&#39;ve done it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m particularly font of the &#39;K&#39;. Your
    spacing is also just right. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s see some punctuation other than
    what&#39;s in the text samples!

    <BR>You could name it &#34;Typeface&#34; - that&#39;s pretty generic :-&#41; We
    had a workhorse once &#40;a real one&#41; named &#34;Crafty Ann&#34; and I&#39;ve
    met more than one farming horse named &#34;Bessie&#34; and I should probably go
    to sleep now.

  body: I&#39;m glad you&#39;re pushing some boundaries here. I love to see  <BR>the
    condensed weight. My only criticism of Verdana is that  <BR>it&#39;s often too
    wide when you want something to be a tad  <BR>quieter. <BR> <BR>And I&#39;ve never
    been a fan of the round-top A in bitmap faces. <BR> <BR>The small caps are a nice
    touch. <BR> <BR>Regarding naming. I couldn&#39;t help noticing Bitstream&#39;s
    Vera, <BR>named perfectly so that it sits right on top of Verdana in  <BR>my menu.
    It seems to say, &#34;Looking for Verdana? Try Vera.&#34;

  body: Hee, is that sample text from <i>The Onion</i>?  Sure sounds like it. <BR>
    <BR>And the &#34;b&#34; does look somewhat &#34;h&#34;-like...  though I don&#39;t
    have any problem reading it, I can nonetheless understand how it would be easy
    to make that mistake, and it doesn&#39;t seem &#34;balanced&#34; in comparison
    to the &#34;d&#34;.
