body: "Dear forum members,\r\n\r\nThis is a typeface in progress (Thin version) -
  at this point, kerning etc. is only very basic. \r\n\r\nWhat I need in terms of
  critique and feedback is a general first impression when you look at the attached
  PDF. Of course any other - maybe more detailed feedback - would be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\nAlex\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: This is already quite good. IMO all you need is some character. Try to add
    some personality to it.

  body: I do recognize some personality in the slight rectangularity of the round
    shapes (e.g. O, ). Experiment exaggerating that feature. That would be your starting
    point, I'd say. Good Work! There's not much to comment, it's a minimalistic design.

  body: Maybe it's just me, but I'd say what you did is an exercise in creating a
    font heavily based off Gotham.
