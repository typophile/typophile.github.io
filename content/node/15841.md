body: "I'm working on an identity package for my full-time employer that requires
  something more than online business card factories can provide. I'm also getting
  fed up with some of the copy shops we use for a lot of our other materials who either
  assume I don't know what I'm talking about, don't pay attention to the quality,
  or don't have the capabilities I need.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a printer that can
  take direction but also offer it, and can do solid offset printing for a reasonable
  price. I'm not looking to do anything crazy or unusual, but I'm specing stock and
  inks, etc. and want a conscientious printer. Any other capabilities (Indigo, low-run
  color copy, etc.) are a bonus.\r\n\r\nI know almost nothing about printers in the
  NYC area and any help/advice would be great. Even a resource for or list of decent
  printers would be great, as there are so many to wade through and I can't afford
  for this project to come out half-baked. Many thanks in advance."

    of few others.

    them for bids and liked the people.

  body: Chris the problem with printers in NYC is they aren't printers, they are print
    brokers. You need to find a print broker that you trust and your print jobs will
    be handled in places as close as 26th Street Manhattan and an hours drive in New
    Jersey and even a flight to Atlanta. Your print broker will have enough contacts
    to keep the quality and the cost in line for your job. Altag Press was a print
    broker I used for years, but I've used others and got good results.

  body: Hey, sorry. I drifted a bit from this topic. Thanks so much, all three of
    you. I'm going to look into all three options. I think the print broker angle
    might make the most sense. I'll let you know what happens.

  body: 'DO NOT GO TO "5 Star Printing" in NYC. West 26st. They are running a con
    game. The paper stock they use is the thinnest I''ve ever seen. They do not use
    printing 101 quark express to cut the paper so that the edges are white from mis
    cutting and the sizes are all off. They give you a "proof" card that looks completely
    different then the actual order. It''s a total fly by night, con artist place
    that should be out of business. Stay away! '
