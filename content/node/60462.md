body: "This is a logo I designed a few months back that I'm now revisiting. The mark
  is based on an abstracted coffee grinder, and the name refers to the idea of fusing
  coffees from different countries and cultures together to create unique blends.
  His coffee is also fantastic :)\r\n\r\nI liked the type at the time but the \"n\"
  at the end of fusion now really bothers me, I'm leaning towards just making that
  top line all uppercase. The distressed look is in line with the look we're developing
  for the brand, you can see the site (just launched a week or two ago) at http://www.fusionbeans.com/
  We're also going to do a letterpress business card which I'm pretty excited about.\r\n\r\nI'd
  love some feedback on the mark, type, or any other thoughts/ideas. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fusion_logo_6468.jpg]"

  body: "What is it exactly that bothers you about the N?\r\n\r\nMaybe take the 'u',
    flip it and use that as an 'n'. Or just cut off the bottom right serif. (I would
    only recommend this type of thing for logotypes)\r\n\r\nI would decrease the size
    of 'beans' to align in between the 'u' and 'o'. Right now they're kinda competing
    and more contrast is needed. I don't know if I like the mark or not...\r\n\r\nBesides
    that, I can definitely see this brand having a nice distressed/rough but elegant
    script face.\r\n\r\nJeo."

  body: "In my opinion, if you want to retain some of the feel of the present logotype,
    instead of going uppercase, I would try something with a unicase look.\r\nOtherwise,
    I would try a completely different typeface (stencil comes to mind).\r\nAs for
    the mark, it feels to me a little too industrial (or something related to the
    sun).\r\nMaybe you could accentuate the spiral shape (like streams of beans fusing
    together but also like the coffee\u2019s aroma diffusing)."

  body: "Good feedback, thanks guys. I think I'm concerned that the 'n' could come
    off as a bit kitchsy? But if the crowd here is ok with it then I'm not as concerned.
    And I'll definitely look at that alignment, good point.\r\n\r\nriccard, I actually
    like the mark for that reason, since \"fusion\" does have a bit of a sun/nuclear
    reference to it. It's also gone over well industry-wise, other roasters and baristas
    that have seen the site or the interim card (attached below) have commented on
    the grinder reference. I'm ok with it looking a bit industrial as well since we're
    going for that sort of worn/textured look. Appreciate the thought though, and
    I'm not opposed to other typefaces so I'll check out some options, thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fusioncard_3816.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grinder_4101.jpg]"

    shape was a sun or fire to represent roasting. I like the lowercase "n". To me
    "BEANS" should be slightly smaller and tracked out a bit.

  body: "I think I get it. The top left serif on that lowercase N sticks out. It's
    too big and too straight for comfort when we compare it with other more regular
    text typefaces. Kind of bothers me too.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if I get in \u201Cdesigner
    nitpicking mode\u201D, the whole type bothers me; alignment, lowercase/uppercase
    mixing, different size mixing (and hence, different stroke widths), kerning (mixing
    uppercase with lowercase makes that a bit harder) and even some of the details
    on some of the letters.\r\n\r\nBut if I relax, I'd say I really like the whole
    thing. The looks and feel of it are pretty nice (although not necessarily innovative,
    but I'm not nitpicking, now) and it kind of makes me want to taste that coffee.
    And I don't drink coffee. And of course, that symbol rocks."

  body: "maybe it's just me--but to me, to the website feels out of place.\r\n\r\ni'm
    not sure if moving that onto the side with the rest of the info is a good move,
    either aesthetically or practically, but you might consider trying it. (aesthetically--i
    might benefit the right side, but might detract from the left by having too much
    information, practically--is it a good thing or a bad thing to have information
    on both sides). \r\n\r\nor it could be that there is a circle in the coffee above
    the website, that subtle, sensual curve--and the straight baseline of the type
    just goes against that. \r\n\r\nif it were to stay on that straight baseline,
    i might try just putting it back to a pure horizontal and moving it more towards
    the bottom right, a little further away from that circle."

    taste the coffee (especially as a non-coffee drinker) I'd say it's done its job
    :) I agree on the type issues though, that's what I'm noticing now after revisiting
    it. I'm going to work on some alternate versions this weekend without the case
    mixing and with some adjusted kerning/spacing and see what it comes out like.\r\n\r\nevan,
    good point on the web address. If we go the letterpress route we'll definitely
    be moving all the info onto one side (and would most likely lose the background
    image) and I probably would move all the type to a pure horizontal. If that's
    the case, does the logo still work misaligned or should it rotate to the 90 as
    well? Just thinking out loud...\r\n\r\nI'll take a look at moving the web adress
    onto the front of the card as is and play with the alignment there as well, if
    we were to just print that one sided 4-color we could probably afford to do a
    cool emboss/deboss of the logo on some nice recycled-looking stock. "

    you thought about printing on actual mini bags? If you did that, then into each
