  interested in ID'ing this font:\r\nhttp://www.archdaily.com/79692/makenna-resort-drucker-architecture/general-plan-11/\r\n\r\nNotice
  the Type in general seems 'lowered' around the centre of the letters. eg: the G,
  centre of the E, R, A and P seem to be lower to the baseline than centred around
  the middle of the letters...\r\n\r\nIt is a lovely clean font and would love to
  know what it is!\r\n\r\nThank you in anticipation.\r\n\r\nRegards, Andrew"

    Frutiger\r\nthe font used on the website itself is Ariel"

    vertical legs whereas this font has angled legs ; such as an upside down W.....\r\n\r\nThanks

    aligned.\r\nThanks your your assistance, guys!"

  body: "I think I'm with Riccardo. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/myriad/\">Myriad</a>
    comes in a variety of widths and seems to match the lettering shapes (M, R, G,
    C, W) from the sample. If it was possible to confirm the R leg shape I think that
    would cinch it. On my computer the lettering is too small to be sure.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hi guys, Back again.\r\n\r\nHave had a look at Myriad type but what gives
    this font away is the low middle line of the G and B to identify a few..... Also
    with the B the upper part of the letter is not as formed as the lower part.....
    (lower part extends out further)\r\n\r\nNot sure where to look now. Would this
    font be a Legible font?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nAndrew"
