  have experience with Cyrillic. i.e., who are the best ones that currently accept
  commissions (based anywhere)? Preferably with experience creating typefaces for
  editorial contexts (magazine, newspaper).\r\n\r\nI know Gerard Unger has some of
  his typefaces in Cyrillic and that Monotype does commissioned work. Any other names
  and thoughts would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank in advance for suggestions...\r\n\r\nMB"

    young designers from Russia:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.laterica.nl/index.php?/project/laterica/\">Irina
    Smirnova</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://cyreal.org/\">Alexei Vanyashin</a>\r\nThere are
    many more talented people."

    designers are \"sometimes mistakenly called a typographer.\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks
    for the names! I will check out their work."

  body: Of the Russia-based designers with considerable professional experience I
    could recommend, in random order, Tagir Safayev, Alexander Tarbeev, Gayaneh Bagdasaryan,
    and Natalia Vasilyeva. Manvel Shmavonyan who lives in Yerevan, has a good number
    of excellent Cyrillics under his belt. Many Cyrillic fonts designed by Russian
    and non-Russian professionals are offered by <a href="http://paratype.com/help/designers/">ParaType</a>.
    Matthew Carter, Robert Slimbach, John Hudson, Steve Matteson, and all designers
    who took part in developing <a href="http://www.ascendercorp.com/catalog/microsoft/clear-type-font-collection/">Microsoft
    ClearType Font Collection</a> are very good at Cyrillic.

    Maxim noted, I have some experience designing Cyrillic types, and they seem to
    have been well-received in Russia. It has been a while since I worked on a Cyrillic,
    and I'd be interested in an opportunity to do a new one."
