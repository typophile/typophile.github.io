  where the theme was \"Mario Bros.\" They all had hats with big \"M's\" on their
  hats. They all displays the logo on their shirts\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P2240055_3759.JPG]\r\nThis
  is a man! Yes a man! This is a middle aged man dressed like an old woman. At first,
  I thought it was a woman until he started scratching his hairy legs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P2240050_6603.JPG]\r\nThis
  is a float with everyone in Saints jerseys. The numbers on my home team's jersey
  looks like a collegiate typeface. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P2240054_5748.JPG]\r\nThis
  float was a tribute to someone who died. Everyone wore shirts with messages on it.
  Their shirts and the words on the float was a script typeface."
