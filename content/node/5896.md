    Specimen Books are a regular hot item on eBay. If you got it for 25cents, you&#39;ve
    lived what the rest of us dream about. You&#39;ve probably saved about a hundred
    bucks by finding at a garage sale. <BR> <BR>From what I understand, the 1923 ATF
    Book is the one to get.  <BR> <BR>Reprinting it would be useless... Although I&#39;ve

    having each and every page drum-scanned-orama. I would certainly like a copy if
    he re-printed...its just so much fun to read. They didn&#39;t use Lorem back then...all
    the specimens have clever little paragraphs worded to sell the ATF, and then a
    different para in 8pts, and again in 7pts, 6pts...on and on

  body: Congratulations, Tanya. Two bits? What a steal. <BR>Jared&#39;s right, though,
    the 1923 specimen is the holy grail. The others are pre-Morris Fuller Benton.
    <BR> <BR>As interesting as it would be, I can&#39;t imagine there would be any
    way to justify the expense of a reprint. Real collectors probably wouldn&#39;t
    be interested in a facsimile. The potential market would actually be very small.
    And drum-scanning 1000&#43; page? I suppose your boss could be an eccentric, wealthy
    bibliophile. <BR> <BR>Jared, the maximum protection offered by U.S. copyright
    is 75 years. Any copyright on the 1923 book would have expired in 1998 &#40;and
    that&#39;s assuming they filed the proper extension after the first 26 years&#41;.
    So, if you&#39;ve got the time and the server space, go ahead. <BR> <BR>-- K.

    the value of any further posts from Tanya here. This book is easily worth $100,
    and in very good to excellent condition, much more. Most of the specimen books
    from the major metal foundries are worth this at minimum. The ATF were quite plentiful
    and are still relatively easy to obtain. <BR> <BR>Who places this value? people
    who value them and are willing to pay the the going rate to get them. The last
    specimen book I bought cost $250, an Enschede, and it was quite a bargain at that.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be a bit more careful about copying this and then distributing

    some of the major digital foundries. And we all despise theft don&#39;t we? <BR>

    valid for 28 years, with the possibility of extending it for another 28 if ATF
    chose to do so. They did issue a much slimmer specimen book in the fifties, their
    last. <BR> <BR>Copyright is not the concern. And I&#39;m not sure if patents were
    ever successfully extended to metal type designs. I know copyright could not be.
    <BR> <BR>The copyright law does not cover reproduction rights in entirety though,
    does it. Copyright law more specifically protects intellectual and creative rights,
    not design elements. Nothing is ever &#34;clearly&#34; in public domain. The remote
    possibility of existing trademarks and registration legalities are more of a concern
    here. These would pass on to those parties who acquired the assests of the firm.
    Much as your logo there &#40;nice by the way&#41; if trademarked and/or registered,
    would legally pass on to your heirs, with full rights and protection under the
    law. <BR> <BR>It wouldn&#39;t really matter in the eyes of the law that Graham
    has provided an &#34;admirable service&#34; if someone who had the legal right

    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it is &#39;very telling&#39;, since plenty of non-pi

    for people like Adobe who regularly seek patent protection for their new typefaces,
    it is a case of taking whatever protection is on offer. I agree that the existence
    of design patent protection makes it possible for the US Copyright Office to shrug
    off demands for copyright protection: &#39;Take your typeface across the road
    to the Patent and Trademark Office. They&#39;ll look after you&#39;. But not availing
    oneself of the available protection isn&#39;t going to stir the Copyright Office&#39;s
    heart either. <BR> <BR>In response to Gerald: the USA offers design patent protection
    for typeface design. It does not offer copyright protection; this was confirmed
    in the Esselte vs. Ringer case &#40;note, however, that I&#39;m aware of at least
    two analyses of the case, written by lawyers, that suggest the case was poorly
    argued and the decision in error&#41;. Unlike copyright protection, a design patent
    must be actively sought &#40;it is not automatic&#41;, the review process is more
    rigorous &#40;for example, you have to provide exhaustive examples of prior art
    that may have influenced the design&#41;, and is for a much more limited period
    of time &#40;I can&#39;t remember what it is in the US; the Canadian equivalent
    is Industrial Design Protection, which is for 14 years&#41;. <BR> <BR>Some other
    countries provide copyright protection for typeface design, and the sky hasn&#39;t

  body: '<i>&#62;Nothing is ever &#34;clearly&#34; in public domain.</i> <BR> <BR>Gerald,
    surely you didn&#39;t mean this statement literally. There are plenty of creations
    which are indisputably in the public domain. The melody which many of us know
    as &#34;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&#34; &#40;or the alphabet song&#41; is in
    the public domain; I need no one&#39;s permission to write a song based on it.
    Shakespeare&#39;s plays are in the public domain; I don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s
    permission to publish my own copy of his text.  Da Vinci&#39;s Mona Lisa is in
    the public domain; I don&#39;t need any one&#39;s permission to paint my own copy
    of it. The creative merits of such an act may be debatable, but the legality is
    not. &#40;Unless I try to pass my copy off as the original, in which case it&#39;s
    fraud; but that&#39;s another legal matter.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Intellectual property
    right protections do not last forever. <BR> <BR>&#40;It should be noted, however,
    that any given photograph of the Mona Lisa may not be in the public domain, so
    I can&#39;t just go around indiscriminately reproducing someone else&#39;s &#42;photo&#42;
    of the painting.&#41; <BR> <BR><i>&#62;The remote possibility of existing trademarks
    and <BR>&#62;registration legalities are more of a concern here. These would pass
    <BR>&#62;on to those parties who acquired the assests of the firm. </i> <BR> <BR>Yes,
    you make a good point. Aside from copyright and patent, there are trademark considerations.
    But, as with patents, U.S. trademark registration is also a very restricted protection.
    A period of three years of non-use may be enough for a mark to be considered abandoned,
    unless acceptable reasons are given and the proper papers are filed with the Patent
    and Trademark Office. I don&#39;t know if Kingsley-ATF did this or not.  <BR>
    <BR>But I believe that this protection would extend only to the ATF name and logo,
    and probably some of the actual names of typefaces, presuming they were properly
    registered. I don&#39;t think there is any aspect of the specimen that could qualify
    for protection as &#34;trade dress.&#34; And merely reproducing the logo is not
    necessarily sufficient to constitute infringement, especially if the reproduction
    is in the context of the company&#39;s own publication.  <BR> <BR>&#62;It wouldn&#39;t
    really matter in the eyes of the law that Graham has <BR>&#62;provided an &#34;admirable
    service&#34; if someone who had the legal right to <BR>&#62;challenge his efforts
    chose to do so. <BR> <BR>Granted. My comment wasn&#39;t meant as a legal defense.  <BR>
    <BR>But let&#39;s review: I think we&#39;ve established and agreed that the book
    itself is no longer protected by copyright. There is a slim chance that some of
    the typefaces shown may have been granted a U.S. patent, but &#40;as I think John
    noted&#41; that protection has probably expired; and, regardless, merely reproducing
    the showings would not violate patent protection. Finally, trademark protection,
    if any still applies, would only cover the names and the logo; and I maintain
    that publishing the images of the specimen on the web would not constitute trademark
    infringement. <BR> <BR>But -- correct me if I&#39;m wrong -- I get the impression
    that your initial concern was not so much with Graham&#39;s right to reproduce
    the specimen pages, as with what others might do with the images. If so, I contend
    that we can not reasonably hold Graham responsible for these possibilities, any
    more than we hold libraries responsible because they make their collections accessible
    and provide public photocopiers. If there is any subsequent infringement on the
    rights of ATF&#39;s successors by someone swiping a typeface design, then I think
    that lies squarely on the &#34;swiper&#34;. <BR> <BR>[Standard Disclaimer: I&#39;m

  body: Kent <BR> <BR>Very thoroughly reasoned. I guess my initial reaction was to
    the idea that you can just reproduce whatever you want simply because it is no
    longer copyrighted and I was trying to point out there may be other factors to
    consider.  <BR> <BR>In a book I did a while back we had to enter hyphens in the
    names of characters used by Kipling in his Just So Stories because we discovered
    a famous movie producer had trademarked the names for toy marketing. Our legal
    advice was to copyright the hyphens as &#34;additional material.&#34; Kipling&#39;s
    work was certainly in public domain but there was also a Kipling Museum trust
    which still owned certain properties.  <BR> <BR>What am I saying is you can&#39;t
    be too careful, and you can be at considerable risk. If you run a small business,
    a cease and decease or any other kind of legal threat could quickly drain your
    financial resources and put you out of business, whether or not the threatening
    action had legal merit. You would have to prove otherwise and that is costly.
    If you are doing anything of a &#34;publishing&#34; nature you do need to run
    this all through legal search &#40;trademark, copyright, etc&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the information.

    sequencing of letterforms, not their visual representation. <BR> <BR>But trademark
    can actually be both. If I use the term Adobe Systems in a book I am required
    to either indicate trademark or print a disclaimer regarding trademark. One would
    not have to follow this in most cases, in discourse intended for a public audience,
    such as reviews or criticism, as Adobe is a recognized public name and has, in
    fact, sought that out.  <BR> <BR>But I can also not copy the visual representation
    of the Adobe logo without their permission, whether or not I intend to use this
    for commercial purposes, and I believe this is where your post may be in error.
    <BR> <BR>Registration of name is more tricky because it can be legislated by state.

  body: Gerald, <BR> <BR>I was not talking about tradmarks for logos or company names.
    My point was that the typefaces displayed in the ATF book are not an issue; the
    typefaces are what most of the discussion was about. The trademark on a particular
    typeface only prevents you from making another typeface based on it; there is
    no restriction on how the letter shapes are used in other media.

  body: Actually, Paul, in reviewing the thread I don&#39;t believe &#34;the typefaces&#34;
    were what most of the discussion was about. It was about possible infringement
    for reproducing the pages from the book, which happens to be a type specimen book.  <BR>
    <BR>I think Kent&#39;s remarks were the clearest regarding the legalities of all
    of this. And I doubt anyone would argue against your point about the usage of
    a legally acquired typeface. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s mainly been a problem of the trademark
    of a typeface &#34;name&#34; though hasn&#39;t it, rather than the design per
    se? Someone reissuing someone&#39;s elses typeface with a different name? I recall
    that Adobe goes through extraordinary lengths to ensure that when they issue an
    original typeface, the name they choose is quite free and clear.
