  body: I&#39;d say they used <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/helvetica-95-black/testdrive.html?s=All%2Bmajor%2Bcards%2Baccepted&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank">Helvetica Black</a> and did some cutting and trimming on their
    own. However, that doesn&#39;t mean this doesn&#39;t exist as it&#39;s own typeface,
    the nineties were so wacky that way.

  body: It reminds me of something that I&#39;ve seen before. Maybe from the FontShop
    Fuse collections? Somewhere between Barry Deck&#39;s <a href="http://fontshop.com/virtual/fssf/products/fuse04.htm">Caustic
    Biomorph</a> and Neville Brody&#39;s <a href="http://fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdisplay&amp;displayfontid=FF.8501.0.0">FF
    Dirty Six One</a>. <BR> <BR>More likely freeware, I suppose.

    fonts that disappeared from the  <BR>GarageFonts catalogue. Not even a sample
