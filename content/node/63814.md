  my rough comp in 2 days... TEAR IT APAAAARRRRRTTTT!!!!\r\n\r\nSssignment specs:\r\n1.
  complete name of font must be clearly spelled out in at least one place on the poster\r\n2.
  the poster is to be completed using type only, and no \"cutesy contrived images\".\r\n3.
  establish a very <strong>strong</strong> grid and build your piece on that grid.\r\n\r\nSo
  after the thumbnail critique from the teacher today he suggested I go with the first
  PDF I'm posting, and the 2nd PDF is just a bunch of really rough basic designs I
  whipped out.\r\n\r\nso yeah.... go to town (PDF's are attached)\r\n\r\n(FYI typeface
  used is \"krone\", a spinoff of ITC Korinna, while I was assigned Katrina, another
  spinoff of ITC Korinna)"

  body: "Here are my basic thoughts for the first PDF. I agree that it is the direction
    worth pursuing.\r\n\r\nI very much like the drop cap \"N\" and how that unique
    crossbar meets up with the first line.\r\nThat said, the columns are too narrow,
    and the justification is causing awkward hyphens. Make a wider column, and see
    how a left aligned column works. Strong grids do not disallow ragged right columns.\r\n\r\nThe
    baseline of the light tan \"ITC Korinna\" should be aligned with the large brown
    \"Kori\", or maybe nudge the light tan one up a little so the serifs fit more
    snugly under the brown \"Kori\"\r\n\r\nHave you considered building texture with
    the full character set? The group that runs vertically below the \"N\" drop cap
    is interesting. I feel like you could use that to mimic or evoke an art nouveau
    aesthetic.\r\n\r\nI personally would list the type styles in this order: Regular,
    Italic, Bold, Bold Italic. Also, according to ITC's own [[http://www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/Detail.htm?pid=425839|page]]
    it isn't italic, but kursiv.\r\n\r\nI mostly feel like you can push this in an
    art nouveau (more color/texture) direction or a '70s (think U&lc specimen) direction.
    Those seem appropriate to me.\r\n\r\nI hope you found this helpful."
