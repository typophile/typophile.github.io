  body: "I've looked at this so many times over the years and the first impression
    I always get is - Hobo - but I know that is not correct. This goes way back to
    1971 and so it is pre-digital. I've flicked through all my old Letraset references,
    and nada, zip, zilch zero - nothing leaps out.\r\n\r\nIf you're really stuck,
    you could always ask the record company. I know it's no longer owned by David
    Geffen, or Elektra, but it was relaunched about 10 years ago by Warner Bros.\r\nYou
    could send a tweet.\r\nhttps://twitter.com/AsylumRecs\r\n\r\nI should know this
    and I'll kick myself when I find out what it is."
