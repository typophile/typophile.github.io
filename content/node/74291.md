  very useful, so first thing i want to say is thank you to everyone. Secondly bare
  with me for this one, it is my first post on here.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Outfit_5674.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  was curious to see if any of you were able to recognize the above fonts, I am doing
  a bit of work for my old man but he doesn't have any graphics of company title's
  or logos for business use so i am trying to make them for him. Worst comes to worst
  i can always get a good image and lift the graphic and do some work on it but i
  was hoping with any luck one of you good people may recognize it\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDale"
