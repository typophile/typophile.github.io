<div class=commentbody>As a long-time "lurker", a.k.a. guest, and now a "user" (sounds vaguely illegal), I can say that I spend a lot less time browsing the typophile site since the recent redesign, due to the extremely slow loading of pages. I don't know how it is with fast internet connections, but on a 56k dial-up account I can go downstairs and make a coffee while I'm waiting.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This has already been explained in two or three other threads, but I think it is worth saying it again here.
Typophile runs on slightly out-of-date, donated server space from Media Temple. Because Typophile is now serving up millions of pages per day, for thousands of users (based on current site statistics), we are experiencing slow load times. The past few days have been especially painful because of the upgrade. In contrast to what some may think, we are currently shopping around for a new hosting package that can support everyone's needs and make this site usable and enjoyable for all who visit. Unfortunately, this takes time and for a non-profit community whose contributers work mostly in their spare time, it might not happen as quickly as we'd like. It is frustrating for all of us, but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel and we hope you will too.

<div class=commentbody>There are a few factors that have influenced this change. The previous codebase looked at all of the unique visitors from the last 45 minutes. We reset this during the upgrade to 15 minutes, which reduces the number of guests more significantly than logged in users, since logged in users tend to visit the site more consistently. Probably the most significant difference, however, is that we curtailed a few unruly bots that were eating more than their fair share of page views. If you haven't noticed, the site performance has increased significantly since we told these bots to shoo.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Our human traffic has dropped a little as well since our post launch bot invasion slowdown. :( I think that all the search engines, as well as some less useful spiders saw a bunch of new pages after the refresh and they all wanted some. I'm hoping that that all of our human friends will be back, though.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Zara, I considered posting in the Bugs and Suggestions thread, but this is indeed a more general discussion, and I know you wanted to keep that thread to specifics.
<em>The previous codebase looked at all of the unique visitors from the last 45 minutes. We reset this during the upgrade to 15 minutes, which reduces the number of guests</em>
If the codebase is registering Guests in the last 15 minutes, rather than those currently online, the actual number is probably much lower still.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, it's a little bit of a misnomer. There's no real way of knowing whose eyeballs are currently on the site. All a web server ever really knows is who is connecting in the moment a browser asks for a page.

<div class=commentbody>Well, my suggested solution (in part) to the speed problem was to head to the membership page to ante up. After a couple years as a freeloader, I thought it would be nice to pay my way. (And now that I am a wage-slave instead of a poor freelancer, I can afford it.)
To my surprise, the membership page is "temporarily" closed up.
If someone lets me know when it opens up, my wallet may still be open.</div>

Don, indeed it is closed for the time being (and has been since the redesign of 05), until we can implement a new system for paid memberships. Don't worry, you'll have the chance to open your wallet to us soon :)</div>

Just logged in. Discovered I'm showing two avatars in the "Who's Online" collection. I assure you I'm using only one computer and only one browser. But there seemed to be a glitch as I was logging in. The information didn't seem to "take". So I logged in a second time.
