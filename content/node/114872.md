  that I can perhaps describe as \"wrought iron\" because of the curls that look like
  twisted iron strips.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UnknownAsVeniceSM_3942.jpg]\r\nThe
  letters are obviously decorated by hand with painted blue and gold trim plus  shadow
  outlines. But are the letters based on a font, digital or ancient, or are they a
  creative exercise?\r\nThe closest I could find as a font is Jeff Levine's Saddle
  Hitch JNL, \"inspired by a few words set in a decorative typeface from an 1887 publication.\"

  long way from being a match.\r\nAny suggestions would be very much appreciated.\r\nDon"

  body: "Many thanks Mike! I do believe this might point to the source of the lettering.
    Dan X. Solo bought old metal typefaces and Old Vic is his digital version of one
    of them. The differences between Old Vic and Venice might well be the application
    of of a different design philosophy to the same source. Anyway the ID works for
    me.\r\nDon"

  body: Ryuk - Saddle Hitch is what Don mentions above. It differs in several details.
    To me, it looks like a designer condensed Old Vic and used it as the "skeleton"
    for artwork. I could be wrong, though ...

  body: "Hi Mike, I reached the same conclusion. \r\nI have been digging through my
    19th century references for matches and still have not found an old typeface that
    comes as close to Old Vic does to Venice. Might be something from Connor or Bruce
    circa 1850s. Old Vic is not a high quality font and I was thinking of digitizing
    the design, which would be helped if I had some good specimen letters.\r\nDon"

  body: "The showing of Old Vic in the Solotype Catalog:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OldVic_5041.jpg]\r\n\r\nNote
    that Dan Solo changed the decoration on the E's crossbar when he digitized it.
    Also, I just realized that Old Vic 2 (which he made his font from) looks to be
    a fill for Old Vic 1.\r\n\r\nMr Solo was apparently a master of film font alteration
    and special effects - and, indeed, states in the Catalog that his printing company
    invented several optical manipulation machines. Surely the Old Vic series reflects
    those effects.\r\n\r\nDon - excuse my ignorance, but there must have been a way
    to create film fonts from metal type, right?"

  body: "Hi Mike, I'm as much in the dark as you are about the specific methods used
    to create film fonts from metal type. But seems logical that they would have done
    it from a printed specimen rather than direct from the metal type. No doubt there
    is proper guidance on this somewhere on the web.\r\nLooking at the Solocat image
    I agree that Dan X. Solo may have played fast and loose with his metal type in
    making this version. And thanks for pointing out his transformation of the E crossbar.
    Still digging through my old images without finding a source. A present I don't
    even know if this was American, British or Continental European. Tuscans were
    everywhere in the 1850s and 1860s with many variations. I find the treatment in
    VENICE to be much more appealing to the modern reader as titling letters than
    most of the Tuscans. Which is the reason I became interested in tracking down
    its roots.\r\nDon"
