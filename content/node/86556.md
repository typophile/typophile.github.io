body: "Recently I have been using a colleague's computer to type traditional chinese
  using Monotype's MHeiHK-Light, -Medium, -Bold and -XBold. When opening MS Word 2010
  (docx) documents written in PMingLiU (default traditional chinese font in Windows),
  and later highlighting all the text and changing to the MHeiHK fonts the spacing
  around the font is incredibly large causing a 1 page document to be reformatted
  to be 1.25 pages. Note that the line spacing is not changed, but the actual white
  space arount the font is changed - probably to do with how it has been made) \r\n\r\nNow
  my colleagues computer is running Windows 7, Office 2010 and using an OTF font format.
  Aside from manually adusting line spacing for each line of text to match PMingLiU
  - an incredibly tedious task to say the least involving many hours of guesswork,
  is there something I can do, becuase this problem is not apparent when using other
  foundry's donts nor in Illustrator / Indesign CS5 on Windows or any program on Mac
  OSX (Word 2011, AI, ID CD5.5)\r\n\r\nMy Colleague and I jsut want to be able to
  type and everything is taken care of automatically - to create beautiful looking
  documents - simply. Aside from this, the final DOCX will be imported into Adobe
  Live Cycle Designer to create interactive forms (hence the need to use Word 2010
  as PDF files imported to this program are a nightmare!!!).\r\n\r\nI would really
  appreciate any assistance with this one as Monotype are less than helpful."

  body: I'm not sure how much white space you could get rid of, but you don't have
    to manually modify each line of text -- just modify the style (e.g., Normal or
    Body Text), or create a new one specifically for use with the MHeiHK font.

  body: Can't you just set all your text to have a specific ("exactly") leading size,
    in points, no matter what fonts are involved?  Using a style, as Gus suggested,
    is best. I don't have Word 2010, but this is a paragraph option in Word 97.

  body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nFron the screenshot attached it shows how the default microsoft
    font (PMingLiU) uses only very little space between lines, whereas the MHeiHK
    font is much more spaced. I have put underlining and captured the screenshot while
    selecting some text in this example to illustrate my point. On the right of the
    image (you may need to scroll), you can see the paragraph settings. \r\n\r\nIt
    has been suggested that I set an \"exact\" height for MHeiHK or indeed all text
    - this is fine, providing that I use only one typesize i.e. 11. I create documents
    that fit certain criteria for visual design. I.e. Firstline headings are 50% larger
    than body text for example and I also use this font in conjunction with Latin
    fonts as the latin characters in MHeiHK and PMingLiU are horrible. Now having
    said that, I know that it is not the Latin fonts causing this situation, you can
    see from the examle of PMingLiU and MHeiHK sitting ont he same line that the MHeiHK
    sits slightly higher on the line, than PMingLiU and after typing the MHeiHK text
    the line space automatically increases but this is not actual line space from
    word, but caused by the font itself.\r\n\r\nThis problem, does not however exist
    in Illustrator or InDesign, so it is something to do with how Word handles the
    font.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions as it is rather frustrating that I can not simply
    type document like I would with PMingLiU.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot

    case you would set an exact value for line height for text and a different value
    for headings. This can be easily incorporated into your style sheet.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Hi Andre,\r\n\r\nHow exactly can I work out what the spacing used by PMingLiU
    is? As this problem only exists in the Windows version of Word, not the Mac version.
    Many of the documents we work on are first designed on Mac and then we open in
    Windows and the whole layout goes to custard :-(\r\n\r\nIf I knew what the standard
    space is for PmingLiU I could, in theory, apply the same settings manually. Any
    ideas?"

  body: "Just an addendum to what J. Tillman writes...\r\n\r\nIf you're using Word
    on both Macs and PCs it's probably a good idea to *always* use a fixed line height
    since there are differences between how line height is calculated on Macs and
    PCs -- differences which shouldn't really exist except that the specs for vertical
    metrics haven't been followed consistently by all application developers.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n"

  body: "Andre, I couldn't agree more, these differences shouldn't exist, however,
    it only happens with this particular font. Not any of the PMingLiU or SimSun variants,
    or any other Chinese fonts we have been using from other manufacturers...\r\n\r\nJ
    Tillman, yes, that is what I have been doing - however it is rather difficult
    when we are dealing with size 11-72 to judge the exact equivalent for each font
    size... You would think that MS would play nice on both platforms... evidently
    not :-)"

    Li U which came with my (rather old) version of Office, then its default spacing
    will be roughly 120% of the point size plus whatever amount of leading word adds
    automatically. Try setting the line spacing to 120% of your point size and see
    if that looks roughly like the spacing word produces for Ming Li when an exact
    value is not specified. If that looks right, you can use it for both fonts.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
