  body: It would be best to repost in a smaller size. Add a few detail close-up shots
    since you want a technical critique. <BR>From what I can see, there is a few problems
    that you need to deal with. I can tell you designed this by connecting regtangles
    and circles, instead of drawing the forms in bezier. You have some inconsistencies
    where you knocked out and intercepted forms. If you are using a vector program
    &#40;which is by far the best way to do this&#41; view it in outline and make
    adjustments. <BR>You can do the knock-out and connecting objects process you are
    familiar with as a base and then rework the files on a top layer to make it easier.
    Let me know if you understand what i am talking about.

  body: On the logo the transition from the curve to the straight in the open counter
    of the h is a bit sudden, and the halo and horns need some work to give them the
    same prominence. The halo is the only item which is angled, which needn&#39;t
    be a problem, but you need to sort out the weight. The umlaut vertical positioning
    is also something that needs attention. <BR>Tim

  body: Well, Gabriel, .gif is not a vector file format, of course, but, .gif files
    should be significantly better if you want to show simple shapes and vector images,
    and .jpg should be better for multicolored and photographic images, on the web..
    <i>&#40; Well.. This shall only be for web / screen related files, not for print,
    then.. &#41;</i>
