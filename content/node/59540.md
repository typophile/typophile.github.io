  feedback on those, but I wanted to get some feedback on the originals. \r\n\r\nThanks

  body: I like your Sommet. I'd make only one comment. I find the S s don't fit the
    spirit of the typeface. I don't know what, but something disturb me in it. I'd
    try the spin more horizontal or less oblique. I think it would more fit with the
    a, e. Keep going.

  body: The one significant problem that I see is that the italic <em>a</em> is too
    easily mistaken for <em>o</em>. It will probably need a stem of some kind.

  body: "Sim,\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing that out. I have refined the S and s so that
    the center stroke is smoother and the outside shape is \"blockier\" but I'm not
    sure if I've specifically addressed your issue. I will continue to analyze that.\r\n\r\nCerulean,\r\n\r\nI
    completely agree with you about the a variant, and had already made one with a
    stem. Good catch.\r\n\r\nI've attached a preview image and a larger .pdf that
    includes some Cyrillic copy I pulled from wikipedia. I hope there are some Russian
    natives that can look it over and offer feedback.\r\n\r\nThank you for the advice
    so far,\r\n\r\nJeremy Dooley\r\nwww.insignedesign.com\r\n\r\n[[http://www.insignedesign.com/files/SommetRTypoCYR.pdf]]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sommet-Page-Source2_5258.png]"

  body: "The boldest weight works best. A lot more could be done to harmonize the
    shapes of the letters. Perhaps take a look at how <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_sanuk_1_ot/\">FF
    Sanuk</a> balances verticals with subtle near-horizontal curves. The diagonals
    can be somewhat jarring in this scheme. W calls too much attention to itself,
    and I think M should be tamed as well.\r\n\r\nAs for the Cyrillic letters, \u0443
    needs to descend, the 'legs' of \u0434 need to descend more, and the bowl of \u044C
    needs to be a touch taller and narrower and given a treatment similar to d. The
    side of \u0431 probably should be more vertical. The \u043C stands out even more
    in the Cyrillic, and should really be given vertical sides."

  body: "Jongseong,\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and feedback.\r\n\r\nI'm studying
    FF Sanuk per your suggestion. I was wondering about the W, and your comment pushed
    me to rework it, but I kept the old as an alternate. I prefer the spread M form,
    but I created an alternate and used the vertical sided M and \u043C for the Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nPer
    your comment, I've extended the \u0434 legs. Let me know if I need to go further.
    I changed the y to the English lowercase form as the other references agreed with
    you. I had already reworked the \u0431 prior to your comment. \r\n\r\nI've increased
    the counter size of the \u044C on the bolder weights and made it a bit taller.
    Could you clarify \"given a similar treatment to d?\" My refs all agree that is
    it appears like an upside down P smallcap.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJeremy Dooley\r\nwww.insignedesign.com\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SommetPageSourceCYR_6630.png]"

  body: "I like the improvements!\r\n\r\nThe \u0434 should still descend a bit more.
    Usually it descends as much as the \u0446.\r\n\r\nThe ascender of the \u0431 looks
    a bit cramped against the bowl. I would nudge the part that connects to the bowl
    up and to the left, so that the curve is a bit squarer.\r\n\r\nThe counter size
    and shape for the \u044C looks right. What I meant about the treatment similar
    to the d (I should have said b) is that the bottom of the bowl could be curved
    and skewed, which is a defining feature of this design for letters such as a,
    b, and d. You can refer to [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andrijtype/oksana-text/|Oksana
    Text] to see how this letter can be treated in an informal Cyrillic design.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    the M doesn't have to be vertical. I thought a vertical M would be in keeping
    with your design where the vertical lines are the constant shared between many
    letters, but in the case of the M (and for \u043C), I now think having the sides
    a touch inclined would flow better with the rest of the design. The original spread
    M is too much for the Cyrillic, I think, but maybe something in between would
    work.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
