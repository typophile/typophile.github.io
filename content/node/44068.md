    like RTF, you can simply place the .rtf file into an InDesign document. It will
    preserve (as well as it can) formatting."

    in TextEdit. That should do the trick.\r\nMake sure to check the import options
    when placing your text in InDesign (\u2018keep formatting\u2019 etc).\r\nF"

    Local Formatting: Dave Saunders wrote this cross-platform Javascript that can
    run through a selection of text (or the whole document, if nothing is selected)
    and replace locally-formatted bolds and italics (among others) with equivalent
    Character styles. The script adds the styles to the Character Styles palettes
    on its own,no need to create them yourself. Works in CS1 (change extension to
    .js), CS2, and CS3.</cite> \u2014 <a href=\"http://indesignsecrets.com\">InDesign
