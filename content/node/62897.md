  body: "Even if you don't want the font to reflect the content, it should at least
    remain appropriate.\r\nDp you need \"special\" features? (i.e. small caps, lining
    numerals, superscript, semibold, optical sizes for footnotes, etc.)"

  body: "Hi. I don't need any special features, just numbers, lower and upper case.\r\n\r\nI
    have access to all the adobe programs and I will probably be using in design for
    the project.\r\n\r\nI'm not really after anything wacky, just something easy on
    the eyes :)\r\n\r\n"
