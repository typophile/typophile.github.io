  seperations for the white inside of the logo and the black. I have the arc as an
  eps i brought into quark and the wings are a tiff file made in photoshop imported
  into quark.\r\nAny help would be great. Thanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_3552.jpg]"

  body: You could trace it again in Illustrator. The logo is very pixelating. Photoshop
    is not a tool for designing logo. :)

  body: "Yes, it is possible but will take some effort.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick rework
    showing the 'white' areas as 100% Magenta. Doing this will give you the ability
    \ to output CMYK separations from Quark. (The M plate will produce the 'white'
    and the K plate will handle 'black')\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LRRP-Sample_5805.gif]\r\n\r\nIt
    would be ideal if you could lay down the white base and overprint the entire logo
    on top, without any trapping.\r\n\r\nIf trapping is required in all of those areas
    you have the potential for a real nightmare because Quark can't trap an imported
    EPS or Photoshop generated bitmap.\r\n\r\nHandling the trap in the EPS with Illustrator
    is pretty straightforward but working with that bitmap in Photoshop to get the
    trap right would be involved. You would also need to work in CMYK with two layers.
    Bottom layer 100% Magenta and the top layer 100% Black with the layer set to 'Multiple'.
    Always best to check your channels when doing something like this. (Hint: The
    Y and C channels should stay solid black if you did it right)\r\n\r\nI can give
    you more details on the process if you can tell me how this will be printed...
    (eg. White + Black on a T-Shirt??)"

    as a professional, it helps to know how to spell the technical terms of your trade."
