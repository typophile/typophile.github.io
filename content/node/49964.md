    a corresponding print face, as they were set up specifically for the sewing industry,
    and what works with yarns.\r\n\r\nWhat most of the script fonts don't share is
    the script lower case with the very pared down/almost print glyphs of the upper
    case in the sample you posted.\r\n\r\nYou can try [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/commercial_script_virtual/?sample_text=Lilly%20Beach%20House|Commercial
    Script]] or [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=monotype+script&x=0&y=0&sample_text=Lilly%20Beach%20House|Monotype
    Script]] for a similar proportion/weight.\r\n\r\nOr if you are having something
    actually embroidered you may find an existing similar embroidery font - [[http://www.llbean.com/shop/guidePages/monogram/index.html|Script]]
    for example comes very close.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
