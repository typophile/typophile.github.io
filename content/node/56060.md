  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NationalHappens_5934.png]\r\n\r\nChester
    and Kris made me happy today too. \r\n\r\nI completed National by way of the excellent
    Taste Test program (that is until we get the condensed styles which would be soo
    welcomed) <em>and</em> I got a head start into Copernicus.\r\n\r\nBoth types are
    versatile, however Copernicus is increasingly so. It\u2019s stylish, neutral,
    literary, corporate, historic and contemporary\u2014all rolled into one by way
    of the fantastic stylistic sets.\r\n\r\nYou can be neutral and corporate as seen
    here:\r\nhttp://vllg.com/Village/GalaxieCopernicus/Example+About/\r\n\r\nOr you
    can go for \u201Cbaroque\u201D with handsome literary swashed italicized letters:
    J,v,w,z. And I use the word \u201Chandsome\u201D correctly as even though there
    are elaborate forms at your disposal, industrial strength features have been applied
    globally; sheared terminals (like Charter), generous ink traps, and in the bolds\u2014chunky
    slabs (like Meta Serif).\r\n\r\nAlso, I\u2019m a huge fan of brushy foxtailed
    type. Gary Munch\u2019s Really and Mark Jamra\u2019s Latienne are my favorite
    examples. Really is elegant and designed for books. Latienne, the same but without
    restraint.\r\n\r\nCopernicus is neutral and fabulous, and in between if you like.
    This is the better Platin. \r\n\r\nhttp://vllg.com/PDFs/vllg_GalaxieCopernicus.pdf\r\n\r\nMikey
