body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI'm having a real nightmare here so any help would be really
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nI have two separate families both with Light, Regular, Medium,
  Bold and Italics. I have named the families following Adams and Karstens advice
  and read all the posts I can find here. The naming has gone well but the order of
  one of the families is completely jumbled in the font list of the application. Both
  the families are named exactly the same apart from the actual name of the family.\r\n\r\nWhat
  actual determines the order the weights will appear?\r\n\r\nWhat could be going
  wrong with my families where one is ordered correctly and the other not.\r\n\r\nThe
  Fonts are Opentype (Postscript) and I'm testing on Mac OSX 10.6\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6704.png]"

    of Light and Regular.

  body: "The weight class is the number next to the weight name in FontLab.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#wtc\r\n\r\nUse
    multiples of 50 and have a look onto the graphic, that I have posted in the discussion
    to Adama Twardoch\u2019s naming tutorial on the FontLab forum. It\u2019s somewhere
    under tips and tricks."

  body: "I don\u2019t have much time at the moment. If you destroy the glyphs with
    one of the FontLab actions, and if you remove the kerning, you could upload the
    fonts and post them here without the fear, that anyone steals your fonts. Bug
    fixing without the stuff, that you want to fix, needs more time. But even if you
    post the (destroyed) fonts here, I would not have the time to have a look onto
    them in the next days. But maybe someone else.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I only can
    say, that the first thing, which I check in those cases, is the symmetry of the
    data of the two families."

    InDesign\r\n3. Search for \"fnt\" and trash all \"AdobeFnt07.lst\" files BUT NOT
    the \"AdobeFnt.db\" files\r\n4. Install revised fonts (drag to \"User\" > Library
