  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">i do whatever i can to find the best specimen for font-ID whenever i ask for your help.
asd 2818 just doesn't seem to be a popular choice amongst collectors - so there is no scanned cover out there right now.
"wtf's" results therefore were rather "wtf!##"
;)

perhaps a few hints on he font:
to me it has something trajanesque (i went through tagged search on wtf but couldn't get a match)
capital_y is half-palm
cipher_2 has a unique (closed?) curl
up- and downward serifs are rather pointy
sidewards serifs - very hard to tell whether they are a little curved or this is the  result of bad photo-resolution
small letters are rather wide - small_a is very nicely shaped, perhaps leaning a bit to the left; small_t has an interesting downward serif on the cross-bar

thank you![img:sites/default/files/old-images/1111_6431.JPG]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">on a simpler scale - am i correct that you would say: capital_n and _m hint to an old style antiqua/humanist?

i absolutely get the similarities with some of the schneidler letters which you proposed.
all in all i am not convinced though - the dissimilarities are too striking in the end
(i don't have any bauer specimen book to compare to admittedly)

recording is from '70 (production no later than '72)
design for hmv and angel identical (GB)

what do you make of the ciphers btw?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The photolettering/filmtype firms had first class lettering artists who redrew many of the classic fonts. Sometimes as formal fonts, but more often as not they were custom projects for record labels, book covers etc. Most of these creations have not been digitized. Circa 1970 was at the peak of this process.

Image Club is now defunct, and I can only find “free” font sources for it. Opti-Castcraft called it Nova Augustea and Amanda Medium Agency.

Anyone figured out yet what the original source phototypesetting/metal source was?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Aurea looks like a knock-off of Nova Augustea (1951), by Alessandro Butti and Aldo Novarese for Nebiolo, inspired by Roman inscriptions. Unfortunately, the only legit digital version available is the all-caps handtooled Augustea Open (http://www.myfonts.com/search/name%3A%28augustea+open%29).
The font in the sample looks like someone took Nova Augustea and placed Schneidler fishtail serifs.

		<div class="commentbody">thank you all!

i'm amazed at your great input!
me taking just a little nap - and here we are with bold results!

the small letters hint very much towards nova augustea.
i'd love to award the title of problem solver - but am not sure what typophile etiquette says: first come first serve OR original font priority over digital match?
both kthomps5 and riccard0 came up with great info!
thanks to don & bob for research as well!
i slowly get an idea what photolettering was about - i do imagine they took nova augustea and blended it by overlay with the schneidler serifs - would that be roughly right, don?

have a round of thank-you-typophile-trivial-pursuit:

which type setter by profession was elected president of his country by popular vote?</div>
