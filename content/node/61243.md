  points of the bezier curve have been \"correctly\" chosen, when the points are at
  extrema, no doubts, here just for comparison. My main doubt is whether or not put
  a curve point at an inflection point (mathematically speaking, the curvature changes).\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your comments"

    represent different aesthetic choices more than proper placement from a technical
    standpoint. A curve in a letter is good because it looks good, not because it\u2019s
    drawn according to notions established in a hypothetical drawing."

    the same problem: inflection points are unmarked, which can cause\r\nfunny wobbles
    depending on how you're outputting a font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi James,\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree with you, the examples here are just a
    kind of attempt to systematizing some doubts that arouse when I was trying to
    learn to draw some real glyph.\r\n\r\nI believe I don't explain my doubts so well.\r\n\r\nSo
    let me try explain better what are my doubts, I hope someone can help me to establish
    a good starting point, o good procedure to start.\r\n\r\nI was trying to read
    a lot and learn with that. Stephen Moye in Type by Design gives me 4 tips in the
    starting:\r\n\r\n1) The Bump rule\r\n2) The Rule of one-third\r\n3) The Conciseness
    rule\r\n4) The Orthogonality rule\r\n\r\nHe also consider them a just starting
    point, not something you will not break a lot. My doubts arouse when I was simplifying,
    merging points, and I start to think whether I was simplifying too much, too few
    points. When I find a portion of curves similar to the snake5.jpg my inclination
    was to choose the inflection point, as it will lead to less points, perhaps more
    easy to edit and to achieve what I would like, but I may be wrong.\r\n\r\nI was
    thinking when it is a good choice to put a point always in the inflection point.\r\n\r\ns1.jpg
    is just a glyph with points at extrema, as we are recommmended, no doubts.\r\ns2,
    s3 and s5 are almost the same, the less points leads me to opt for s5 so I could
    try this approach as a starting point.\r\n\r\nBut my doubts did not arise from
    a simple S, but from similar to the Snake form. If I opt to a approach similar
    to the s5, it will lead me to something like the option Snake5. Or, in order to
    establish a good starting point (I also does not think some rules will lead me
    to the \"perfect\" form, I am just asking what more experienced designers think
    it is the best starting point), I will almost naturally choose the inflection
    point.\r\n\r\nIf I opt to have less points and choose the inflection point chances
    are I create a small \"kink\" or a small bump, although it can be visually avoided
    I know it cannot be mathematically avoided, as I will not certainly pick the inflection
    point but something close, I really would like to know if I must or not consider
    it.\r\n\r\nSecond advise I would like to listen is if it is or not a very bad
    choice make options like the snake5. And if a line drawn from and extending one
    of the handles intersects the adjacent point?\r\n\r\nSorry James I didn't make
    my doubts really clear, I believe now they are. And thanks for any help in my
    beginning naive doubts.\r\n"

  body: "Hi hrant\r\n\r\nthanks for your help. I've asked this question before and
    some of the answers I heard it is that they stopped marking inflection points
    long ago, but maybe they can be convinced to change, and they told me to ask here
    in typophile, so that's why I am here.\r\nApple recommends to mark inflection
    points:\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/textfonts/ttrefman/RM01/Chap1.html#located\r\nBut
    as I've seen a lot a S like the s5 I start thinking if it is important or not.\r\nI
    will follow your advise and mark the inflection points.\r\nthanks hrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
