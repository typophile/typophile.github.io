body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy first post here. Hope I'm doing this right. Greetings to everyone.
  Im recreating some vintage automotive stickers and am having trouble locating some
  fonts. Pics attached. For the Mickey Thompson sticker I'm looking for the fonts
  that make up the \"M\", the \"T\", \"ickey\" and \"hompson\". I did find a somewhat
  close match for the \"ickey\" and \"hompson\" in URW Artcraft Bold but there are
  several things about that font that make it not quite a match. For the Schiefer
  sticker I'm just looking for the font that \"Schiefer\" is in.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mickey_4749.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/schiefer_5557.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time,\r\nAaron"

  body: "The M and T are similar to Latin Wide. I don't think you will find a closer
    match. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/artcraft/\">Artcraft</a> is
    as close as your going to get for \"ickey\" and \"hompson\", but it's been stretched
    horizontally and fairly tightly spaced. \"EQUIPPED\" is Microgramma or Eurostile.\r\n\r\n\"Schiefer...\"
    is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-expanded/bold-italic/\">Century
    Bold Italic (a.k.a. Century Expanded Bold Italic)</a>. The other font in the second
    one is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/futura/condensed-bold/\">Futura
    Bold Condensed</a>."

  body: Thanks. This indeed helps out a lot. I figured I'd just have to make the M
    and T from scratch. Thanks again.
