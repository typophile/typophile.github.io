  body: "This appears to be an old Filmotype font from the fifties called Free. <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/flyer/\">Flyer</a> is similar, but
    not as bold. \r\n\r\nBTW, Stuart Sandler (Font Diner, Mr. Retro) has begun reviving
    the entire Filmotype library, so Free may see the light of day again."
