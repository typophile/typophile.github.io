body: "I swore I had seen a post on how to treat (lc, small caps or all caps) academic
  degrees (BA, PhD, MA). I just can't find it. If any knows where it is I would appreciate
  it. \r\n\r\nBasically, I want to know how to treat academic degrees in body copy.
  All caps seems too emphatic and small caps almost seems too twee. \r\n\r\nThanks!"
