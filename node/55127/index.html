  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>For anybody who is interested in why I am so interested so all of a sudden in these matters surrounding type, this is the bio I posted to my profile yesterday.</p>
<p>I am a conceptual artist living and working in The Hague, The Netherlands; I make installations and performances that focus on the construction of meaning, and the need to say something, while at the same time say it is nothing. I use the media text, speech, graphic design and photography in my work because they constitute the language of the everyday, the language of which the exploration interests me. I also teach Interactive Media Design to students of Graphic Design at the [[http://www.kabk.nl|Royal Academy of Arts]] (KABK).</p>
<p>I joined Typophile because I have been starting to feel a strong engagement towards the relation between technology and culture. The issues I am concerned with are not limited to type, but they are especially visible in this field because type is probably the most evident place for technology and culture to meet.</p>
<p>That means the type design community is not hampered by the distrust many other cultural disciplines bestow upon technology. Digital technology plays a central role in any type designer’s practice, because it’s the only means by which to achieve the desired end.</p>
<p>Why is this a good thing? Because if you use technology to produce culture, you have to make sure the technology is up for it. And if it is not, you make sure it will be—which means you will enrich <em>what technology is</em> in the progress. The tradition of type designers building their own tools, and especially the work of [[LettError]], is an inspiration for me.</p>
<p>As a visual and cultural professional, I feel my skills, concepts and values are underrepresented in the digital public space. This is why I started the [[http://authoritism.ericschrijver.nl/|Authoritism]] project: I declared myself art director of the internet for 2009 in an effort to propagate the value of a visual and cultural perspective to the digital public, and the necessity of a digital perspective to the visual and cultural public.</p>
<p>This is from the website:</p>
<p><cite>When we bemoan the crudeness of digital technology, we act as if it is handling on its own accord. It is not. People are constantly making decisions that fundamentally influence the way we will be dealing with technology in our future lives, whether as designers or as end users.</cite></p>
<p><cite>And that is why we should get involved. As designers and artists, we are either busy with communicating something, or with the process of communication in itself. At this moment the screen is replacing paper as the medium we frame other media in. We should not see this as a big deal. The process of communication will remain. But E think we can&rsquo;t afford to let the primary medium of our time be one that we can not express ourselves in, or one we do not feel like applying our skills to.</cite></p>
<p>These are pretty abstract reasons, but there is also a more concrete one.</p>
<p>Part of the aim of the [[http://authoritism.ericschrijver.nl/|Authoritism project]] is to learn from the success of the Open Source movements. Making strategic decisions in what to distribute freely to whom seems to amount for at least a part of their success. I feel the cultural market lends itself well to much the same strategies, including the market of typefaces.</p>
<p>Seeing that Typophile has seen members of different communities debating the merits and woes of ‘giving things away for free’, this seemed like a proper place to join the discussion.</p>
