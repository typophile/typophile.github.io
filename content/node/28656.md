  body: "Would that it was so simple as picking a typeface.  Letters in a typeface
    are what they are to be used in many combinations with all sorts of text.  To
    make this possible, they are designed to be agreeable with many different neighbors.
    \ A logo has only one pair of neighbors and must send one message above all others.
    \ This means much more is involved.  Start by playing with many fonts in the required
    letters and see what interactions take place with that finite set of letters.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "\"designed to be agreeable with many different neighbors\"\r\n\r\nBy this
    I mean that each letter in a typeface must be able to be used next to every other
    letter.  Some languages may have different combinations than others but  generally,
    there must be allowance for all letters working together.  In a logo, there are
    only a few letters.  If you look at IBM, for example, there are only 3 and only
    one combination.  Since that is true, I would not have to be concerned with how
    those letters work with anything other than I or B or M and therefore have more
    freedom with them but I aalso have less material to carry the message.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    choose a typeface that has good looking "A"s.
