Unions and some professional organizations are not bound by the same antitrust rules that businesses and individuals are. This is why, for example, the Graphic Artists Guild can do a survey of hourly rates for design services and publish it.

I can’t see how AIGA can even compare to a real union. For starters, how many unions not only demand membership dues but then also demand more money every time you want to show up at a meeting?</div>

How would that work, Hmm;

Prick boss: Smithers, I want this book layed out by first morning light so either pray for an eclipse or start burning the midnight oil!

Smithers: I am going to call the Design Union Steward and protest mistreatment!

Prick boss: Don't let the door hit you on the ass on the way out and tell all those young design graduates waiting up front with baited breath for their first job to come on by. Oh, and tell that Steward guy his ass is fired too!</div>

Unions are generally most effective in occupations where employers hire a large workforce of union members -- places like factories, hospitals, schools, etc.  Employers know that if the union goes on strike they'll lose a large workforce that may be difficult to replace.

There aren't many companies that have a huge staff of graphic designers. If a company has two graphic designers on staff, the threat of a strike won't mean much. If they go on strike they'll just be replaced.

Also unions generally specify wages, which may be easy to do in a factory where you're paid by the hour, or a school where you get a yearly salary, but many (perhaps most) designers are self-employed and price each job individually based on a variety of factors.

I just don't see a union happening.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">At one point a while back I had a concept to start a font foundry with a union theme but after running it past a few midwesterners, the idea was quickly dismissed. Unions aren't a creative theme to hang a hat on, they are very serious business here in the midwest and still very much active.

I agree fully with James that there isn't really any advantage to unionizing the font industry because we're all independent contractors as it were not unified under any single organization that we work for or service . . .</div>
