  about Louis John Pouche\xE9's Ornamented types but got distracted by the content
  of some of the posts - it's great to see such informed information and eclectic
  tastes! \r\n\r\nOne particular post I thought I'd make a comment on was one about
  Trajan and the origin of the serif; I believe it was Catisch who suggested that
  the roman lettercutters painted their letters on the masonry first and then carved
  them and that the serif may have developed from this practice. Well, I've considered
  this, having done some lettercutting myself over the past ten years (only in an
  amateur fashion I hasten to add, but under some fairly qualified guidance) and what
  I've found is that its actually much easier to carve a letter with serifs than without
  \u2013 the purely mechanical action of the chisel and the angles at which you use
  it at, particularly at the terminals of letters seems to suggest that serifs were
  developed as a practical response to the question of 'how can I finish this letter
  off neatly and uniformly\u2019. Square-ended 'sans serifs' are much harder\u2026\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wow! Beautiful! I hope you can excuse these outbursts... I have quite a fetish
    for stone carved letters. I spent about a month in college carving New England
    slate. Those letters were just terible, though... that stone is in a deep, dark
    place... never to see the light of day again!\r\n\r\nI found your comment \"Square-ended
    \u2018sans serifs\u2019 are much harder\u2026\" quite interesting. When you are
    drawing with a brush (or even a broad nibbed pen), or carving, it is certainly
    more convenient to flare out and use serifs. But when one is drawing outlines,
    straight lines win out in the contest against curves every day of the week. So,
    digitally, serifed letters are much more different. Interesting parallel, I guess.\r\n\r\nIn
    Emigre 64(?), Elliot Earls wrote an interesting piece about contemporary type
    design approaches. What I remember the most from that piece was his emphasis on
    stroke endings. He wrote that something has to happen there to define the design
    of the face (if I rememebr correctly)."

      red? I've seen a Richard Long stone sculpture/installation of deep red slate
      and wondered where it came from. Hehe I know what you mean though about stones
      in deep dark places - the lettercutter who taught me described my first attempts
      at serifs as \"British Rail angle-irons\" - the profile of a railway track I
      guess!\r\n\r\nThanks again"

  body: "Lovely caps you have cut there Jack!\r\nI quite agree about the stone cutting
    tools and the practical reason for the serif to come into being.  If you start
    with a V shaped tool, it is difficult to start with a flat cut.  The Romans sure
    did do it in a striking manner though :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

      cut alot of 'sans' - hence Lithos but I'm led to believe they had a different

    black if you polish it.
