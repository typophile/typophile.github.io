    the occasion, such as Christmas. This dilemma leads many for the Internet looking
    for a new Christmas gift idea that makes the perfect statement to this receiver.

  body: I think that's a little unfair that was definitely not my intention.  I always
    research an area before I start to design that is not to say I plan to copy the
    things I like!!

    to see people try first and look later: it makes for much more creative output.
    And this peeve extends to formal education: when you teach somebody something,
    you're perpetuating the past and curtailing discovery.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    discovery, or ground breaking, is difficult. I have always felt that you have
    to teach them the rules before they can break them! Oh wait, my uneducated monkey

    can pick up some basics from the \"swirling background\" and make highly fruitful
    initial explorations, and <em>then</em> get some formal education to tie things
    down. People who start off formally either take decades to become liberated, or
    never know what they're missing and simply fortify the establishment.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "\"Formal education isn\u2019t useless, but it is a two-edged sword.\"\r\n\r\nI
    agree Hrant. I am self taught, for better or worse. I learned from traditionalists
    like Zapf, Poppl and Schneider by looking at their work. I took off from there.
    I exploited their anomalies as well as their stalwart forms. One has to march
    to their own drummer and I think that is what sets people apart. Discovery is
    inherent in a mischievous mind : )\r\n\r\nMichael"

    is an awfulness that compares favorably with the great London plague and fire
    of 1665\u201366. No one escapes the feelings of mortal dejection, inadequacy,
    frustration, loneliness, guilt and pity. No one escapes feeling used by society,
    by religion, by friends and relatives, by the utterly artificial responsibilities
    of extending false greetings, sending banal cards, reciprocating unsolicited gifts,
    going to dull parties, putting up with acquaintances and family one avoids all
    the rest of the year ... in short, of being brutalized by a \u201Choliday\u201D
    that has lost virtually all of its original meanings and has become a merchandising
    ploy for color tv set manufacturers and ravagers of the woodlands.\r\n\t \u2014Harlan
