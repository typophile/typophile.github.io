  body: Penn's version reads a lot better as EB, but they all have a sideways space
    invader look, which I like but it might not be the image you are trying to convey.

  body: "That's fine--I mean I had basically designed THAT as you see, but it wasn't
    quite right.\r\n\r\nI DO like the cut into the B, and I had not tried it that
    way.\r\n\r\nDid you adjust line weight though? It feels like you did but being
    smaller it's hard to see the comparison in the same way.\r\n\r\nI suppose this
    is a fairly logical way to draw an EB, but there just seems to be something clever
    about it that needs to be teased out. Maybe line weight is it. Maybe its slight
    cuts at corners or something. But either way (in the intricacies of type creation)
    that's where my expertise is in need of help."

  body: "Yeah, all I did was take your jpg and put a black box over the gaps, and
    a white trangle for the cut. Everything else is as you drew it.\r\n\r\nThe one
    thing I did notice while I was playing around with it was the line weight of the
    middle arm of the 'E' and the crossbar and top and bottom bars of the 'B' \u2014
    it feels too light. When I thickened them though, it felt more like a 'B' in a
    frame. So, things to think about . . .\r\n\r\nAnother thing you might try is raising
    the waist of both of them since they really should have smaller top sections than
    bottom \u2014 they wouldn't be designed with the crossbar/arm in the exact vertical
    center of the character."

  body: "I know what you mean about raising the waist. I think I designed it that
    way originally, but wasn't happy with it.\r\n\r\nThen i changed the weights, and
    am more happy. So maybe I'll try going back that direction based off this one.\r\n\r\nI'll
    have to find the middle ground between more of a stamp-like mark and one that's
    too much like a letter. I have a feeling moving the waist might ruin it. We shall
    see.\r\n\r\nI'll play with the crossbar weights first though and re-post soon.\r\n\r\nThank

    that I mean, if I can do something better, than that would certainly fall by the
    wayside. And better is better. \r\n\r\nNext, certainly not academic. Absolutely
    \"personal,\" but I'm not making it is art.  I would envision a final design that
    I could use professionally if necessary. Either way, i want it refined and to
    be proud of. It would be a good exercise and potentially added to my portfolio
    if not my actual logo.   \r\n\r\nAnd finally, the square idea intrigues me. I'm
    6 foot 5 inches so a vertical mark, if done right, would certainly be applicable
    for that reason. But I'll see how a squared version could work.  "

    keymaster? (not that there's anything wrong with that....)\r\n\r\n@evanbrog:\r\nI
    like the direction the squared version is going, but I think the challenge is
    about the empty spaces. The variable thickness (of all the white spaces) is distracting;
    not just the white channels between the two letters, but the counters of the B,
    too. I want them all to match. \r\n\r\nThe multiple stroke weights are causing
    the letterforms to disappear into an abstract maze. The center crossbar (the \"tie\")
    of the E is too thin to feel like it's part of an E - the E becomes a C. I know
    you chose to match the stroke weight of the smaller B, but that choice hurts the
    E too much. The B doesn't look nestled comfortably into an E, it looks like a
    mean little robot \"B\" (much like R2D2) sent out a parasitic tendril to siphon
    off energy from a giant C. The C is about to eat the B - or crush it <em>(it's
    alive! eek!)</em>\r\n\r\nTo me, actually, your E (C) reads as a vise grip. I can't
    shake it. \r\n\r\nOh, and I swear to Tschichold I'm not tripping. "

  body: "Apankrat, that was very cool! But your idea completely haha so I can't really
    touch it.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I stepped away from this for a long while until it was
    completely out of mind. On looking at it again, what became evident to me is that
    every time I saw this mark (which you hadn't seen yet but had become bolder and
    squater)--I could basically see the EB in the small B. The large E was almost
    completely useless at that point, more of a bracket than an E, which some of you,
    rightly I think, were getting at.\r\n\r\nSo this next one isn't cleaned up but
    it's what felt right to me tonight.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MyGridMark3_3745.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    think it's a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe relationships playing out
    in my head for refinement are:\r\n1)Weight of negative spaces. I think thinner
    verticals and thicker horizontals keep the shape of the B while allowing for a
    separate (that's important) demarcation of the E.\r\n2) Width of the whole piece--not
    too wide for a B but long enough arms on the E.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?"

    Might be the inner E's vertical line cut. wonder if eliminating the inner E's
    small vertical line would allow it to read like a EB more clearly.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/eb_3542.jpg]

    counterspace can help with the legibility of the B, WITHOUT making some sort of

    of dig this stencil look but I am just not sure about the counter shapes of the
