    The old story I\u2019ve read suggests that people applied the term disparagingly
    and it entered common use."

  body: I've heard similar stories on how some sans-serif type came to be called "Gothic",
    though that may also have been a false dilemma analogy comparing type to "Romanesque"
    and "Gothic" architecture, and in seeing that the type wasn't "Roman" it must
    therefore be the other.

    fonts in their books, newspapers, ads etc. or - sometimes Antiqua fonts. So the
    \"grotesque\" outfit of Grotesk fonts was something very new for them. May be
    they understood it (or it was planned to make them understand it) as a revolutionary
    new and grotesque form of font.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch

  body: "The first sans serif typeface was the Caslon Egyptian, in 1816 (not 1832).
    At this time, the renowned typographers were using Bodoni, Didot and so on; they
    considered these new faces, lacking sophisticated serifs and sporting a boring
    fixed width,  with horror and disregard for a very long time, and started calling
    them \"gothic\" and \"grotesque\" in order to mock them; both terms were references
    to the middle age. At this time, everything which originated from the middle age
    (architecture, litterature, calligraphy) was considered the pinnacle of ugliness
    and was very much disregarded - Louis XIV even wanted to redecorate the front
    face of Notre Dame in Paris, but had to cancel his plans (for he had not enough
    money to do so). Therefore, the terms \"Gothic\" (a reference to the architecture
    of Middle Age) and \"Grotesque\" (which until this era was the name of the monstrous
    little heads carved in wood on middle age houses, before turning into an adjective)
    were very much probably, at the beginning, destined to mockery.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "<em> both terms were references to the middle age</em>\r\n\r\nI don't think
    that's precisely right. From the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms: </em>GROTESQUE
    [French, from the Italian grottesco] a term used to describe a type of European
    ornament composed of small, loosely connected motifs including scrollwork, architectural
    elements, whimsical human figures, and fantastic beasts, often organized vertically
    round a central axis. The original inspiration for such ornament was provided
    by the archaeological excavations undertaken at the end of the 15th century of
    the ancient Roman interiors of the Domus Aurea of Nero and of other villas in
    Rome and Naples. These revealed a hitherto unknown side of Roman art in the playful
    decorations found in the underground rooms (grotte) of these buildings. They were
    soon copied by Italian artists and their designs were disseminated in the form
    of prints. The use of grotesque decoration spread throughout Europe in the 16th
    century. Raphael incorporated it into his decoration of the Vatican Loggia (1518\u201319)
    and in France it constituted one of the main achievements of the FONTAINEBLEAU
    SCHOOL. In the 18th century there was a strong revival of interest in grotesque
    ornament, both in the development of the ROCOCO style, and in the renewed exploration
    of Roman domestic decoration following the publication in 1752 of the recent excavations
    at Pompeii and Herculaneum.</em>\r\n\r\nSo in source and original intent, \"grotesque\"
    is better described as a playful/decorative side of classical art rather than
    a reference to the medieval era.\r\n\r\nAnd while Louis XIV was certainly a classicist
    in his preferences, he was long dead by the time \"gothic\" (sans) types were
    so called, at which point projects like the Houses of Parliament in London would
    seem to introduce doubt to the idea that \"gothic\" implied disparagement.\r\n\r\nInferring
    mockery also seems strange when the terms were used by foundries for the types
    they themselves manufactured and wanted to sell.\r\n\r\nThis question has puzzled
    me for a while. Both \"Gothic\" and \"Grotesque\" are among the terms slated on
    my agenda for my current research project on typographical terminology, but I
    have not yet gotten very far on those two."

  body: "<em>...horror and disregard...</em>\r\n\r\nA sweeping statement not borne
    out by the facts.\r\nThe facts being that London founders in the 1830s were not
    unwilling victims of the new diversity in type styles for job printing, and readily
    supplied all sorts. The Caslon & Livermore catalog of 1837, for instance, showed
    fifteen pages of bold, condensed, all cap, sans serif fonts.\r\n\r\n<em>Inferring
    mockery also seems strange...</em>\r\n\r\nBut don't discount humour in typographic
    terminology of the early 19th century.\r\nIt was, after all, a time when the <em>bon
    mot</em> was in fashion, from Beau Brummel down.\r\nThomas Love Peacock's hilarious
    <em>Nightmare Abbey</em> (1818) demonstrated that the Gothic was fertile ground
    for satire.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I suspect that the type size Bourgeois, referring
    to a middle-sized type, was a witticism.\r\nDavid, was that term ever used in
    France to describe a type size?\r\n\r\nSo \"grotesque\", used to describe a style
    of type, could have been a grandiloquent reference to the grotto from whence came
    this primitive style, according to James Mosley in his seminal work on the subject,
    <em>The Nymph and the Grot</em>.\r\n\r\n<dl> <dt>Self-deprecating humour has a
    long history in type specimens. For instance, from Fry, 1828: </dt> <dd>IMPERFECTIONS\r\n<em>EXPEDITED</em></dd>
    <dt> </dl>\r\n\r\nIf you want to take \"grotesque\" quite literally, it could
    be compared with the recent type terminology \"grunge\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Wow, Nick, that was interesting. I will also dig a little bit deeper in finding
    out the exact truth about these terms, if it is possible of course (but I think
    it is not, unfortunately). I still believe that the terms originated in mockery
    or humour, as you imply, for brits are famous for their inner and very specific
    sense of humor / cynicism. I would not be surprised at all to find out that the
    foundries of Caslon and co. were selling typefaces that they would themselves
    name with circus-like names. I know where the word Grotesque comes from, but I
    highly doubt that the Thorogwood foundry was aware of the italian history of the
    term. I think they simply considered this rough, unelegant type \"grotesque\"
    or \"gothic\", as in, precisely, medieval. Of course \"greek\" would have actually
    been more accurate, but at this time accuracy was not the most important (\"egyptian\"
    were everything but, well, egyptian).\r\n\r\nTo answer you, Nick, about the Bourgois
    term: as far as I know (but I am very far from knowing everything), no, it was
    not used for sizes. The terms I am aware of are:\r\n\r\nDiamant\t(3 pt)\r\nPerle
    or S\xE9danoise (4 pt)\r\nParisienne (5 pt)\r\nNonpareille (6 pt)\r\nMignonne

  body: "Thanks David, such beautiful names!\r\n\r\nSo if the size \"bourgeois\" has
    an English, rather than French origin, it may allude to class matters, a middling
    size of type being appropriate for the reading material of good burgers who were
    not as profligate with resources as the wealthy with their big books printed in
    big type, nor as penny-pinching as the poor, forced to read tiny type to economize
    on paper.\r\n\r\n<em>...the terms originated in mockery or humour,</em>\r\n\r\nRight.
    If the upper crust Hansard, in his worthy tome <em>Typographia</em (1825), was
    railing against the \"monstrosities\" of the new trade typography of 200 years
    ago (anything in his conservative opinion that wasn't a modest old style or transitional
    book face), then type founders who were obliged to make and sell such things may
    well have labelled them with absurd poetic versions of the terms of derision.
    Especially if, like Egyptian and Grotesque, these names performed a kind of \"hamburgefons\"
    display of important letters in the typeface.\r\n\r\nI wonder how far back the
    naming strategy goes, of adopting the critic's insult as a badge of honour. Hence
    Impressionism and Fauvism, of course, and more recently Punk Rock."
