The size ratio change is a good thing, but don't you think something in between would look better? <BR>Also, the design for &quot;v&quot; interferes with the instant recognition of the letter, thus making the name itself hard to read. out of all there, the first one is neat and has far more potential to be made into a corporate mark. <BR> <BR>George</div>

The others look somehow to fashionable for me, will be outdated in a year or two, they typo is entirely too much like a tachno-disco-flyer for my taste.

Also, the mark made sense in the original (albeit a bit kitschy with the effect of flowing into the l).. bit with the new design it really makes no sense anymore.  <BR> <BR>Maybe try to keep it simpler, more classic, less fashionable.

There doesn't seem to be any problem-solving with your &quot;directions.&quot; You're just making the &quot;thread&quot; in the green square thicker and changing the typeface. Have you come up with any new ideas? <BR> <BR>I also don't see the necessity of a redesign. Maybe you could add a more natural typeface to it and create a more elegant whitespace flow inside the box&hellip;I'd think about how the white-space &quot;thread&quot; flows inside the green box. It's too mechanical in yours, which is the problem I see with the original. That &quot;thread&quot; (white space in the box, whatever it's supposed to be, I think of a piece of thread for sewing) could flow into and out from the box better. If it's supposed to be a &quot;V&quot; then you can make it better. <BR> <BR>The type you have makes me think I'm about to walk into a state-of-the-art Oxygen bar or something. I don't know much about textile companies (feel free to give some more info), but this doesn't have the feel to me. <BR> <BR>What are you trying to say with this identity?</div>

Even straight patterns in textiles have curves once you look up close. <BR> <BR>I would suggest that you do something to make this feel more human or fabric like. Not so vertical, horizontal, or straight. Make it flow. Push a more freeform, flowing direction, then if necessary, bring in some more gridded design to control the potential chaos. Am I making any sense? Some of the illustrations in the link below might help loosen you up a bit, but notice how alot of them maintain a controlled grid combined with free flowing forms. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.chapter3.net/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.chapter3.net/">http://www.chapter3.net/</a></a> <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Matjaz, <BR> <BR><i>I am trying (hard) to balance between a very trendy ID and something that would not become a bad design tommorow.</i> <BR> <BR>The problem here IMHO, is the type. I think this kind of lettering reaks of present trends: a monoline where the v=n e=a etc. It does so in the same way that photolettering smells of the 1970s and now looks dated. So be careful with this approach. <BR> <BR>One way to distance yourself from this problem might be to use more traditional forms, but keeping the monoline (eg Foundry Monoline). Or you could try a fresh take on an established genre (a neo grotesque, or humanist sans, or a semiserif). How about some of Storm's offerings: Teuton, Sebastian, John Sans, or Dyna Grotesque? Maybe contact Christain Robertson about using Pill Gothic! There's an idea. Good luck! <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm going to echo most of the other posts here, and say that the old logo isn't bad, just old. I think that Daniel's suggestions tap into a good new direction. There's still a lot there in the old Velana logo. It just looks a bit stuffy, IMO. <BR> <BR>I think the type should stay close to its original (in terms of the typeface), and maybe even a similar orientation of mark to type, particularly because it's quite known in Slovenia. Plus, if you keep the same rough proportions, it can be used in ways similar to the old logo. Don't be too eager to violate the brand equity. I do like your tweaking of the logo in the A examples. The B example looks nice, but starts to lose the 'V' quality of the old mark. The dip seems too shallow to me, if you're going to make the curves more exaggerated. <BR> <BR>Be sure to emphasize to your clients the difference between 'new and fresh', and 'disposable'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To Tiffany's point, the identies found in the interior design world (and much of what is associated with it) often uses extremely clean and simple geometry. Personally, I love that look as opposed to the alternative gaudy designs that I also find common in the industry, but it is also very refreshing when that norm is broken. <BR> <BR>I'm not sure that the resemblance of Tom's concept to cosmetics is such a bad thing. This indicates that it has a feminine appeal, which is very appropriate to the fashion and textiles industry. <BR> <BR>IMO, go with the &quot;flow&quot;. <BR> <BR>Matjaz, I like the mark on your last posting better than the other ones, but I'm still not feelin' the type in combination with the mark.

Maybe I'm only one person, maybe I'm completely high.  <BR> <BR>Think about Knoll. They have had that wonderful logo forever. Yeah, it came and went and came back again.
