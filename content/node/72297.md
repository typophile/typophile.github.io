  - A Lettering Safari</strong>\r\n\r\nZebramatic is a font for editorial design use,
  to create headlines and titles in eye-catching stripes. Constructed to offer flexible
  and a variety of graphical possibilities, Zebramatic type is easy to use. The font
  is offered in three styles: <strong>POW, SLAM</strong> and <strong>WHAM</strong>.
  These styles work both as ready-made fonts and as patterns to create unique, individualized
  type. The font design\u2019s full potential is unleashed by layering glyphs from
  two or all three styles in different colors or shades.\r\n\r\nWorking with the different
  styles I was reminded of the late Jackson Pollock poured paintings\u2014in particular
  the documentation of his painting process by Hanz Namuth and Paul Falkernburg in
  the film Jackson Pollock 51. In Pollock\u2019s pictures the complex allure arises
  from how he layered the poured and dripped paint onto the canvas. Similar joyful
  experience and exciting results emerge by layering the different styles of Zebramatic
  type.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<strong>For more detailed information please read here on

  body: "@ nora g, thanks for the link. Some of the initial design work is indeed
    similar. \r\nThough the idea of Zebramatic were the layering and the interchangeability
    to avoid repetition, \r\nand the font was done analogue not digital.\r\nWonder
    how the opfont would look like stacked. \r\n\r\nThanks again for the link!\r\n@
    Everyone - please post links to similar work - thanks.\r\n\r\nFor more details

    And you did it by hand, what a huge work.

  body: 'Congratulations too Harald! My comment sounded perhaps a bit harsh ;-) That
    was not my intention, sorry. I only wanted to link to another, at first sight,
    similar looking solution. But the opfont is a student work, and not made to stack.
    There is only one version of it and no layer versions. '
