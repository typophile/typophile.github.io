body: "Dear Typophiles, \r\n\r\nhas anyone a suggestion for a roman that'd be a good
  text face companion for Futura? \r\n\r\nI'm designing a flyer / magazine ad and
  later a website for a music competition from a non-profit. \r\n\r\nThe competition
  and the organisation are focused on an unusual Modern composer - active from the
  30's through the 70's, who flouted the atonal trends of the time to compose music
  that was melodic and harmonic yet very fresh, clear and modern-sounding. When I
  heard the music I thought of Futura - modern yet (some think, Bringhurst does at
  least) humanist. So that's what I've been using for this client for past couple
  years. \r\n\r\nBut these days I'm not as into Futura as when I used to be able to
  print it in lead (my college print shop had some nice chunky sizes that looked really
  great) and I'd like to round it out with a text face. But I can't figure out how
  to match or complement those round, wide shapes and long ascenders - help!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLeslie"

  body: Maybe it's because I saw them paired together quite a bit in the '80s, but
    I think of Baskerville when it comes to serif companions for Futura. Baskerville's
    round shapes, low x-height (in the non-ITC versions) and long ascenders/descenders
    make it a decent match. Mrs. Eaves (a Baskerville derivative) might work, too.

  body: "Thanks everyone for the helpful suggestions. I'm glad to hear others thought
    of Baskerville and Bembo; I had actually thought about this too but thought I
    might be nuts since they come from such a different time and heritage. So it's
    good to hear that it makes sense.\r\n\r\nI had actually looked up this question
    on typografie.info, where it had already been asked, and there the responses devolved
    into bickering with people insulting each others' suggestions and good sense.
    Someone even said the question was totally naive and a designer who asked it shouldn't
    be working for paying clients yet! They say Germans are more blunt and direct
    than Americans; maybe it's true...\r\n\r\nI'm going to go ahead and try out some
    of these suggestions, but if anyone else stumbles on this thread and has other
    ideas or input, I'd welcome them as well.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

    the case."
