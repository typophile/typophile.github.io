body: "i would like to hire you to create a logo/logotype for my web design company,
  \"moscarda\" sometimes i abbreviate it to \"mdc\" for moscarda design collective,
  but i think i just want the logo to say \"moscarda\".  however, if you have any
  creative ideas for \"mdc\" feel free to show me those too.\r\n\r\nas far as style
  goes, i like much of the typography from the futurists, dada, avantgarde.  i'd love
  it if it could look like something from a propaganda poster.  other kinds of logotypes
  i like are hand-drawn, not calligraphy, but more unique.  it is important that no
  two characters are identical.\r\n\r\none idea i had, that i would love to see, is
  a fingerprint logo, with letters hidden inside the fingerprint.  i understand if
  this is too complicated.  other than the possible fingerprint, i don't want any
  other graphics in the logo, just letters.\r\n\r\ni will paypal the one i like best
  $100 in exchange for a hi-resolution file.  if i see really great work, i can pay
  a lot more, but this is a forum post, so my expectations arent that high.\r\n\r\n"

    is capable of or inspired by. I bet Nkauts or whatever his name is uses those
    damn pre made web layout things. Nothing makes my blood boil more than so called

  body: "It's often quite practical and efficient to outsource one's own design as
    a designer. One can often lose sight of the big picture when being overly picky
    with designing for oneself.\r\n\r\nI'll repeat what I said earlier, but I think,
    though it's true, complaining about how it 'cheapens the industry' really has
    no sway on anyone that would use a contest to get design created.\r\n\r\nWe all
    know Wal-Mart sells crap, but in the end, people seem fine with crap as long as
    its cheap.\r\n\r\nI think a better argument to dissuade people from using contests
    is that logo contests aren't actually cheap compared to the quality of product
    you are buying.\r\n\r\n$100 isn't much, but you'd still get a better product spending
    $100 for 1 hour of time from a great designer than you'll get from 20 designers
    of 'contest caliber'.\r\n\r\n"
