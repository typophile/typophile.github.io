  body: That's Chicago. It was/is(?) a system font for Mac for a while. Looks like
    someone also tried to experiment with some of the characters..they look..stretched,
    or as we say on Typophile - squooshed:D

  body: "Spot on, Yehan. Thanks a lot. I'm currently with Windows XP. So I know quite
    little about the old default system fonts on Mac. The typeface in the picture
    is indeed squooshed. A torture for the font.\r\n\r\nJamesZ"

  body: "I don't know about that. My friend stumbled upon the picture on a graphic
    design forum. Sometimes, it's client that requests a specific typeface ,say, Calibri
    or Segoe, and a graphic designer just needs to finish the rest. But I don't like
    that way.\r\n\r\nJamesZ"
