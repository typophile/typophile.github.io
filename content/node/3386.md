body: 'Hi everybody. After finish Kautiva set I wanted start  to make my first serif
  font.. This one began based in Kautiva &#40;see at the bottom of the image&#41;
  and I incorporated some kind of serif that I felt works good and made the weight
  a little lighter changing the contrast of the curves. <BR>I still wanted to mantain
  some strong references from the original sans like the angle of some ends. <BR>Not
  uppercase yet, not kerning, just this. <BR> <BR>Any comment, help will be really
  apreciated. Gracias!!!!!! <BR><!--attachment: libertina-27574.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*14.4*libertina*libertina%2eswf

  body: 'hey alejandro, i think this is a great face. i must agree with Juan Pablo,
    however, that it is more of a display face than a type for text. If your goal
    is for this to be a display face you just need to iron our a few kinks. If you
    want this to be usable for text, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to lose some of
    the more decorative features. <BR>This critique assumes that this face will be
    used for display, I&#39;m no pro, so take all I say with a grain of salt or two.
    <BR>Firstly: I love the g! However, I feel that the &#34;eye&#34; of the g may
    be too small. <BR>Secondly: I like the breaks on the legs of the h, l, m and n.
    I think they add cohesiveness to the design as you used similar serifs for characters
    such as a, etc. However, i think that the breaks should probably descend a bit
    below the baseline because the breaks make these legs look shorter than the normally
    serifed legs. <BR>Finally: The r looks like an amputated n. Take a look at <a
    href="%20http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics&amp;id2=&amp;id3=&amp;id4=&amp;id5=&amp;idpic=17#pictloader"
    target="_blank"> this</a> to see how you can rework this character. <BR>Hopefully
    someone with more experience will take a look at this and give you some more in
    depth criticism. Keep up the good work!'
