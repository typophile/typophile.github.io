  body: "It looks like you're just mixing uncial forms into DIN. Some of the forms
    are really interesting, especially P, B and R. But it's too rational in a way
    that drains it of life; I think this is most apparent in L and T which resemble
    the horrible \xA3 in Univers. And that neon-sign M is just plain lazy. Find a
    way to bring this to life and you could have a winner in the way Sowersby just
    hit two huge geometric sans home runs with Metric and Calibre. "

    I looked at the sample and saw a book. An atlas, I think. Must be all these place
    names... Anyway, it was a large (ca. A4) hard-cover with plain, white covers.
    the sample had ca. 3\xB0 list to the left, filling up the lower half with medium
    grey text. The title was black, the subtitle red, both in a heavy Helvetica.\r\n\r\nFuture

  body: Andreas... I think you are off to a wonderful start but at this point it is
    only lightly sprinkled with the quirks of the Uncial/Half Uncial genre. If you
    are "gonna do it" then look to the "pinched" terminals in the m, n, h, u, w, y  etc.
    And feel free to explore the 2 story "a" and the rounded T. Look at reference
    for the capital N...  Just a few suggestions. Victor Hammer spent a lifetime on
    these forms and GG Lange did a very nice "version" with Solemnis. I think it has
    real potential (subjective, of course) I would like to see more idiosyncracies.

    miserable time \u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is not meant to become any
    sort of historically faithful rendition of Uncial. V. Hammer, yes, but that hardly
    counts for me here.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite, I\u2019m tempted to make it look techy,
    even quirksome.\r\n\r\nUnicase is surely worth consideration. The majuscules too
    big \u2013 I think about it.\r\n\r\nThere might be an alternative set with some
    capitals more 'common'. There may be about six (?) weights at the end. Variants
    with higher ascenders.\r\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t ask me for Italics  :-)"

  body: "Great idea!\r\n\r\nThe critics are premature\u2014if you develop this as
    a typeface, then the issues which they have raised will be resolved when you add
    weights, especially bold. As it is, this is the germ of an idea. A huge number
    of light weight sausage faces have been published, because they are so easy to
    make, and for this reason they don't amount to much (they are indeed lightweight).\r\n\r\nI
    don't consider this at all modernist. The nearest would be if one imagined Rudolf
    Koch had done something similar.\r\nCertainly DIN rounded seems modern, but its
    antiqua forms are much more reductive and geometric, and one might imagine them
    being produced with a Rotring barrel-nib drafting pen held vertically, with a
    plastic template.\r\nIn contrast, I imagine your uncial as being written freehand,
    using a \"Speedball\" round-nibbed calligraphy pen."

    \"o\".  Perhaps start with a more football or rugby shaped o and see if it finds
    that neitherland between flat sided sans and true uncial. Think about the blackletter
    \"o\" as an origin?\r\n\r\nThe \"a\" is really a tough sell as well, perhaps double
    bowl is a better start?"
