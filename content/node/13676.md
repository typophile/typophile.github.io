  [[Linotype]].\r\n\r\nThe Mergenthaler Linotype Co. was founded by [[Ottmar Mergenthaler]]
  in 1890, Brooklyn, NY. He moved the production of his [[Linotype Machine]]\u2014the
  \"Blower\"\u2014there from its first factory in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nOver then next
  century, Linotype would manufacture a series of hot metal, photo, and digital typesetting
  machines. Their library of typefaces for these machines (and later for personal
  computers), would reach the thousands.\r\n\r\nThe Mergenthaler Linotype Co. grew
  quickly, creating international subsidiaries and forging partnerships the world
  over. Linotype & Machinery, Ltd. was founded in England, also in 1890. In 1896,
  The Mergenthaler Casting Machines company opened shop in Germany. [[D. Stempel AG]],
  Hass, and many others began producing Linotype matrices for their clients. Eventually,
  they would become part of the Linotype organization itself.\r\n\r\nThe American
  Mergenthaler Linotype Co. remained the mother company at the center of the global
  Linotype entity until the 1980s. Thereafter, its assets were purchased by German
  interests, who formed [[Linotype AG]] in 1987.\r\n\r\nMergenthaler Linotype developed
  a slew of typefaces that are now part of the present-day [[Linotype]]'s digital
  collection: [[Ionic]], [[Excelsior]], [[Bell Gothic]], [[Metro]], [[Electra]], [[Caledonia]],
  and many more. Designers who have worked for Mergenthaler Linotype include [[David
  Berlow]], [[Matthew Carter]], [[William Addison Dwiggins]], [[Chauncey H. Griffith]],
  and [[Rudolf Ruzicka]].\r\n"
