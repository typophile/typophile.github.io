body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI've just started using FontLab Studio and I'm working
  on a new typeface, but I am having a few problems. I have 3 variations of each character.
  These variations would be used according to the preceding character. For example,
  variation 1 of the character a would always be used after the character b, but variation
  2 would be the one always used after the character c.\r\n\r\netc, for the entire
  alphabet.\r\n\r\nI've figured out how to create ligatures, but the problem is ..
  if I were to maanually create ligatures, I would have to make every combination
  of characters (which is like millions). \r\n\r\nI can get ligatures of ab, bc, cd
  etc .. But I would like to find a way to program the font so that I can get \"abc\"
  ... without having to make an actual glyph consisting of the letters a, b, and c.
  \r\n\r\nI hope that makes sense, and that it is possible to achieve this in FontLab
  Studio.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nVeronica"

    except with two types (a: rimshot, B: top and bottom start), with the added problem
    that the the influence a letter has on the one following it depends on its type,
    so that there would be three or four letter combos.\r\nI have no idea how to even
    make ligatures."

  body: "Very briefly, you need to add features. For ligatures, add a 'liga' feature:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feature
    liga {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub f l by f_l;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    f i by f_i;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} liga;\r\n\r\nTo replace glyphs
    by alternate versions in specific contexts, you need to add a 'calt' feature:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feature
    calt {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub b a' by a.calt.1;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    c a' by a.calt.2;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} calt;\r\n\r\nThe <em>a</em>
    marked with a single quote (Typophile may have turned this into an apostrophe
    ...) will be replaced by <em>a.calt.1</em>, but only if it is preceded by the
    glyphs(s) not marked that way -- non-marked letters are considered as 'context'
    which must be present so that marked glyphs will be replaced.\r\nRather than defining
    context glyphs individually, you can also create a class and refer to this:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@CALT_BEFORE_A1
    = [b d f]\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@CALT_BEFORE_A1 = [c e g]\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feature
    calt {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub @CALT_BEFORE_A1
    a' by a.calt.1;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub @CALT_BEFORE_A2
    a' by a.calt.2;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} calt;\r\n\r\nOr define classes
    in FLS's Classes Panel, but omit the <em>@</em> there.\r\n\r\nAlso try to google
    for phrases like \"feature site:typophile.com\", \"feature syntax site:typophile.com\",
    \"calt site:typophile.com\", etc. Feature issues have been dealt with extensively
    on Typophile."

  body: "K.L.\r\n\r\nThank you for your info, but actually I am so at the beggining
    that it is really hard for me to understand how the whole structure works.\r\nI
    tried to create a class for some glyphs and assign the calt feature your refer
    to but actually when I try to generate the .otf font an error doesn't let it to
    be generated. \r\nWould it be possible for you to be more specific on how to do
    it?\r\nAs you sugested, I googled the phrases and there is lots of information
    on this subject but because it is not in a sistematic text it is very difficult
    for me to build the puzzle...\r\n\r\nHope my begginer questions are not too much...\r\n\r\nThanks
    a lot\r\na."
