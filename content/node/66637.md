body: "I\u2019ve been working on the MetaPhile concept off and on since November.
  It does not represent any sudden rush of work. In fact, I\u2019ve mostly been putting
  it off, but over a great deal of time I assembled several index cards\u2019 worth
  of ideas into 19 (now 20) distinct bug reports.\r\n\r\nAs ever in bug reporting,
  we file <em>one bug per report</em> to avoid mixing apples and oranges. Check <em>any</em>
  bug-tracking system.\r\n\r\nI indeed did not embark on a parallel project of listing
  everything salutary about Typophile. This is a bug-reporting project. I\u2019m not
  here to reinforce your own impressions of how fabulous Typophile is. I repeat: If
  you never even noticed these problems, you won\u2019t notice when they fix them,
  either.\r\n\r\nAs a member of this site and just as an informed member of the citizenry,
  I do in fact have a right to submit these bugs. The fact I don\u2019t run the site
  or pay for it means nothing. The people who do and do needed a few corrections along
  the way. And since I am now not the only one filing MetaPhile bugs, I see I must
  have been on to something all along.\r\n\r\n I don\u2019t <em>have</em> to use a
  tone you like. But you aren\u2019t fooling anybody: There <em>is</em> no tone you\u2019d
  like when reporting bugs or when in any way advancing the idea this place is less
  than perfect. There is <em>precisely no tone I could have used</em> that would have
  met with your approval. A lot of you have shown your true colours in the last day,
  resorting to personal attacks that Typophile administrators (not \u201Cmoderators\u201D)
  agree with and will allow to remain online. I\u2019d say my tone isn\u2019t the
  problem.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s up to the administrators (not the \u201Cmoderators\u201D)
  of this site to create a separate MetaPhile forum and move these postings there."

    these bugs (I assume in a more neutral tone) the first time? Or is it that the
    admins didn't pay attention to your bug reports the first time around? Did the
    admins penalize you in some way for submitting those bug reports?"

    to believe that many people often have good reason not to agree, usually with
    your specific suggestions, but sometimes even with your broader outlook. And sometimes
    they just don't care enough about what you're passionate about, so they have no
    reason to take any action (except possibly to suggest that you should improve
    your perspective on <em>human</em> interaction).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
