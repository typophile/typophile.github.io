  body: "Many years ago FontLab took advantage of the free \"MSN Communites\" service
    provided by Microsoft, they could have taken advantage of other free forum services
    provided by Yahoo or some other player. Likely Adam and Yuri's experience with
    the VOLT community led them to pick MSN. \r\n\r\nI think FontLab were beta'ing
    their own hosted forum, but a move to Typophile might be a good idea - less advertising,
    but perhaps slower performance and less up-time?"

    your own, unofficial version here."
