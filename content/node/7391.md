    that</a>&#39;s basically it. Negative tracking, remove dots on &#34;i&#34; and
    &#34;j&#34;, and kern the &#34;i&#34; far too closely to the uppercase &#34;T&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>Why do people <i>do</i> this, this insanely close kerning with uppercase
    T&#39;s? Chill out. Leave the character some room to breathe, please.
