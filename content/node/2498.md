  at <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net" target="_blank">www.mediatemple.net</a>.
  Their $10/month deal seems to be all I need. And I get some comfort when I read
  about their facility being virtually nuke-proof.  <BR> <BR>Anyone here use &#39;em?
  Or can you heartily recommend a trustworthy hosting solution?

  body: <a href="http://www.warped.net" target="_blank">www.warped.net</a> is as low
    as $5 a month, and they&#39;re very reliable and attentive. There&#39;s a special
    now where the first month is free. If you use them, tell them I referred you &#40;my
    username is cerulean&#41; and I&#39;ll save a fiver also.

  body: Can&#39;t really say anything about the service because I&#39;m not hooked
    up yet, but I&#39;m currently looking at going with POWweb &#40;quite possibly
    the worst ending to a name brainstorming session ever&#41;. <a href="http://www.powweb.com/"
    target="_blank">POWweb Link.</a> Their package seems to be pretty awesome for
    only $7.77 per month, with tons of storage, bandwith, etc. The only complaint
    I&#39;ve heard from some current users is that they have some downtime and their
    support takes a little bit to reply. Otherwise, if you know what you&#39;re doing
    and don&#39;t need to be walked through, POWweb is supposed to be great.

    is the best ISP she&#39;s seen in all those years.

  body: 'I third the recommendation for Pair. I&#39;ve never had a problem with them,
    they have a good range of packages/features, prices are terrific, and they&#39;re
    good for geeks and novices both. Like John&#39;s friend, I&#39;ve been on the
    &#39;net since before the Web and have worked with quite the gamut of hosts. Pair
    rocks. <BR> <BR>Also, do heed Hrant&#39;s caution about Hostway -- blech. Stay
    away from Verio, too. As for free web-hosts: I&#39;d be wary, as you have little
    recourse if something goes wrong or you need special assistance.'

    in &#39;you get what you pay for&#39; &#40;with love being the exception, but
    let&#39;s not derail this post, eh?&#41;. I&#39;ll give Pair a look. Thanks, all.

  body: I will drop in a nod to Hurricane Electric. The cost is fairly competitive
    &#40;$9.99&#41;. Service good. And they have php/mysql support at the base level.
    Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s important to you, but for me it has been great to
    drop my stock CMS system on a shared host website. <BR> <BR>Randy

  body: As long as there is an &#34;avoid like the plague&#34; sidebar, I will mention
    Gisol &#40;Global Internet Solutions&#41;. They belong in jail. <BR> <BR>The selling
    point of Warped is that you pay for what you get. If you are slashdotted and see
    a huge spike in traffic, other places usually ask you to upgrade to a higher-limit
    plan from then onward. At Warped, your bill would be $10 instead of $5 <i>just
    for that month.</i> <BR> <BR>Also, there is no obscenity clause in Warped&#39;s
    terms of service. Even when it isn&#39;t necessarily relevant, knowing I don&#39;t
    have to worry about running afoul of someone&#39;s &#34;community standards&#34;
    is peace of mind to me.

  body: Media Temple is definitely worth their slightly higher prices because they&#39;re
    rock solid, and have 24hr phone support. <BR> <BR>I currently have two sites on
    their servers, a transfer I made after a bad run-in with Stargate.  Maybe it was
    just by comparison, but I can&#39;t get over how professional and customer-oriented
    these guys are.  I mean, just look at their company website.

  body: I run a mountain biking e-zine in my spare time. We get about 30-50,000 unique
    users per month and transfer around 50 gigs each month too. We had been hosting
    with someone who had a server on RackSpace, but they&#39;ve become pretty unreliable,
    so I think we&#39;ll head over to Pair. It looks like a good solution.

    look at what you get: 1 gig of storage space, up to 75 websites, and 10gb of bandwidth
    per month. What i do is share it with several friends and the cost goes down considerably.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m curently on an older plan and havn&#39;t upgraded to their new widoze
    Server 2003  that they are advertising here yet. But I&#39;ve been pretty happy
    with that and assume this is even better.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d switch over but it
    means havng to reupload all of the sites that are under my name and that will
