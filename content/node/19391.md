body: "Anyone here use Speedball pens for drawing up drafts? I just got a 24-nib set,
  new-in-box, off Ebay and am really excited to try 'em out. I was totally in the
  dark about the Speedball thing, knowing only vaguely about the world of \"nibs.\"
  No idea about the whole practice of Roman and sans-serif lettering with this funky
  old ink-pen. Must be my age-- born under the sign of Nixon...\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd
  also be interested to know what other sorts of hand-drawing or other handicrafts
  people do when designing type, besides, you know, sketching with a pencil on a pad
  of paper. (One of my favorite activities in a \"document design\" class I teach
  in my department is having students design a letterform with Sculpey.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: Yeah! I found an old Speedball booklet with a lot of the same stuff, and that's
    what prompted me to get the set. Totally cool. Thanks-- didn't know about the
    speedballart web site.

  body: Yeah, I use them (although I prefer William Mitchell nibs). I will sometimes
    use 'double pencils'or a ruling pen for very much the same thing. From that initial
    starting point the pencil becomes my prefered tool until I am happy enough to
    transfer work to the computer.

  body: Thanks-- great pics. I realize I'm a computer-baby. Just found a 1977 edition
    of a typography textbook. A whole chapter on shaving your drawing pencil to a
    chisel point, so you can simulate text at the proper x-height in "comps." Never
    had heard of such a thing!

  body: "I used to use them in the 60s along with the Mitchell nibs.  The speedball
    had large sizes and could hold lots of ink.  I would love to gety hold of the
    oval set which would be the most useful for me in type design.  The flats are
    better for more contrasty faces than I tend to do.  Use good ink though, anything
    too watery will blot and spread too easily.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: I was born
    under the sign of Roosevelt :-)"
