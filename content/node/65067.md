  I read on a website :\r\n\r\n\" so what are the features of humanist sans serif
  faces? One of the first such designs was Frutiger\"\r\n\r\nBut isn't Johnston also
  one, and Gill sans..? These are way older right?\r\n\r\nIt's more that besides architecture
  (read my other forumposts); I'm also looking for artpieces that fit these typefaces..
  \r\n\r\nMaybe you have an idea?\r\n\r\n\r\nx"

    course, there are even more humanist sans-serifs available today. Where once it
