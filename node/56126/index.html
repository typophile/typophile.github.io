<p>While I have to agree the shapes of the fuþark really aren&rsquo;t very pretty in themselves, I think they have a great decorative kind of beauty. And when written rather than carved in wood or stone, I think they had great potential that were never properly developed. Also, one has to admire an alphabet that supposedly were deprecated (is that the right word?) around 1300, but still were in daily use in Telemark in the early 19th century. The last authentic rune inscriptions were made in Dalarna around 1910, supposedly.</p>
<p>I think the Latin alphabet is beautiful <em>because</em> of its inconsistence. And because of its unsurpassed extensibility.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a gross oversimplification. As languages evolved, they had to reflect the sound changes, while maintaining etymological logic and consistency. French, for instance, had evolved to a stage were too many words had become homonyms, so accents, cedillas and circumflexes were needed. Portuguese and Lithuanian, for instance, lost a lot of final n&rsquo;s and m&rsquo;s, which led to the nasalization of the preseding wovels, expressed by adding a tilde in Portuguese and an ogonek in Lithuanian. The umlaut of the Germanic languages expresses the changed wovel, while keeping the relationship to the root. And so on and on. This is the kind of extension I&rsquo;m talking about. One alphabet made usable for several related languages. How did the West make money on Romanian putting a circumflex over an a when its pronounciation changed to i, of etymological reasons? Brilliant minds have made the Latin alphabet work better than any other alphabet in the world. When Turkish was written with Arabic script, it was close to incomprehensible, because of the crucial vowel harmony that just could not be properly expressed.</p>

<p>There it is! Cultural chauvinism, which can permeate anything, including writing systems. It even causes people to not realize for example that the Latin alphabet doesn&rsquo;t even work well for <em>English</em>! Nevermind its idiotic hyper-reliance on an x-height. Saddest of all however, such chauvinism causes people to rape an entire people&rsquo;s psyche by inventing monstrosities like the Vietnamese script.</p>

<p>I <em>knew</em> you would bring that up. And I agree 100 per cent. Vietnamese looks like shit (though I believe it <em>works</em>). That doesn&rsquo;t make my claim invalid. Concerning English, that&rsquo;s the fault of bored monks and halfwits during the middle ages, and a result of the sponginess of the English language. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a great pity that English has become the new lingua franca.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s completely wrong. Why did teachers use the Latin alphabet in schools <em>before</em> the reform, do you think?</p>

<p>Nina, Yes I do! As much of a technical problem itis to space as a type designer, I still love the way it looks and makes a page and still works with photos and illustrations. It does not get in the way of them. Evolution by un-design can bring things into focus and force us to see their own beauty by their opposition.</p>

<p>Chris, but are you sure you wouldn&rsquo;t feel the same about any other alphabet that you would happen to grow up with? And then stress its particularities as exactly the things you love about it? I mean, if I&rsquo;d grown up with the fuþark and now spent my days and nights typesetting and even designing it (funny thought), I might think it&rsquo;s beautiful. Probably because of its angularity. :-&gt;
Which would mean that your comment possibly says less about Latin than about how we tend to feel about our cultural environment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Chris, but are you sure you wouldn’t feel the same about any other alphabet that you would happen to grow up with? And then stress its particularities as exactly the things you love about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, my first alphabet was Greek. With Greek, I find the capitals too distant in form from the lowercase. Granted, they came many years apart. The capitals were more influenced by Phoenician culture and the lowercase more Byzantine and Turkish so I can understand the disconnect. When it came to typesetting, Europeans had a predominant influence and brought the technology after the Greeks were free of the Ottomans. There was no original Greek type by native Greeks for years. The caps became very Roman looking but the lowercase is its own world. Gerry Leonidas does a brilliant job with describing the history and is far better the person to describe it than me.</p>
<p>Getting back to your point, Nina, I feel I am more in love with latin as a graphic designer and user of type than I am of its written script and early history. I like the pages it makes and the even texture. I like the way it adapts to so many typeforms and styles and not so fussy a tradition to follow. I don&rsquo;t see this with large quantities of very calligraphic scripts like Arabic or Chinese. To me, Chinese looks great in small quantities and is more lovable written with a brush than typeset. I must admit that Palatino Arabic, designed by Nadine Chahine, has really made me more of a believer in Arabic as a typeface rather than a written script!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a person can ever escape their early upbringing and feel a level of comfort with what they know best. Others can develop a hatred for type coming from a culture they blame for some wrongdoing. Blackletter has been given an unfair demonic label because many people equate it with the Nazis even though it was around for hundreds of years before there was such a group as the Nazis.</p>
<p>I quite readily admit to being a lover of letters or symbols and don&rsquo;t feel any need to dislike any in particular. I have grown to like Cyrillic even though it is just plain insane as a system that was designed as a whole. There are plenty of glyph pairings in Cyrillic that just look stupid together but I guess that is what happens when the king makes the decisions and nobody can say, &ldquo;Dude, that really does not work&rdquo; like we can here in the Critique forum. :-)</p>
<p>Writing and typesetting is an outgrowth of culture and therefore subject to strange combinations of thought or accident. I just accept this and take my job as a designer to just work with it rather than damn the whole culture for daring to differ from what I would have done if I were the supreme master, King, Czar, Clergy, Poet, Philosopher, Learned Teacher, or Tyrant.</p>

<p>Chris, that was a beautiful declaration of love. :-)
Sorry for letting you grow up with a different script than you did!</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;With Greek, I find the capitals too distant in form from the lowercase. Granted, they came many years apart.&quot;</em>
But isn&rsquo;t that exactly the case with Latin too? I agree though that in Greek the difference seems even more pronounced, with much &ldquo;softer&rdquo; forms in the lowercase.</p>
<p>Regarding the adaptability of Latin (vs. more complex scripts) to different styles, that&rsquo;s a good point. But this would also hold true for other scripts that have a limited character set, limited complexity, and maybe somewhat disconnected lettershapes, no? Like Greek. Or Cyrillic. Or many others in fact.* Am I mistaken?</p>
<ul>
<li>But I guess sadly, there won&rsquo;t be all that many different styles designed for a script unless its &ldquo;market&rdquo; is large enough to enable a broad type design culture, which of course Latin is vastly benefiting from.</li>

<p>Yes, Nina, The Greek is orders of magnitude different in its current state still while the Latin has grown more familial as time has gone by. There have been centuries of Latin type designers around to do many thousands of fonts since Guttenberg. The Greeks had to make do with what the Dutch and Brittish could do with existing equipment in Greece and this brought numerous limitations including using Latin punches for Greek capitals where possible. The Europeans had no malice in their actions, they were just making do with the tools available. Without the Latin-script-using Europeans, there would have been no Greek type at all for even more centuries.
The other issue is the number of native Greek type designers. How many type designers of Latin fonts can you name who are dead, even long dead? How many Greek type designers are from more than a century ago? Damn few if any. Almost all native Greek type designers are still alive today and most of them are young and just beginning their careers. I predict that their influence has not barely begun and will make its mark in the decades to come. Most type you have seen which has a Greek character set was not designed by Greeks. This will change. Gerry&rsquo;s young students will make their names known and there will be a fabulous era of Greek type to come soon.</p>

Same goes for the ratio between calligraphic versus typographic signs and logos (of course I&rsquo;m not talking about signs that are written by hand because there&rsquo;s not enough money to pay for a printed one, I&rsquo;m talking about signs featuring professional calligraphy that usually costs quite a bit).</p>

<p>I think they could, potentially, but they often don&rsquo;t. My guess is that Hrant&rsquo;s comment about resisting assimilation has something to do with it. People using Latin script feel no need to defend it against the hegemony of some other culture, so they do all sorts of wacky stuff to it, but users of less dominant scripts are often very conservative. Even, ironically, when the style being protected is itself a product of past cultural hegemony. Cherokee script, for example, is locked into a model based on American typography of the early nineteenth century; if you tried to make a Garamond Cherokee or a runic Cherokee or a brush-stroke Cherokee, I don&rsquo;t think it would easily be accepted as culturally authentic.</p>

<p>The story is a lot more complicated than that. Sequoyah&rsquo;s original design was quite different from the form of Cherokee that is most familiar to people. When the script was first cut in type, many of the forms were rationalised and, in the process of making them more &lsquo;typographic&rsquo; made to resemble Latin letters.</p>

Thanks – this is an interesting perspective. I hadn&rsquo;t thought about variety in type design that way (more in terms of &ldquo;what the market allows for&rdquo;). But I guess oftentimes the two overlap.</p>

<p>henrypijames,
<em>&ldquo;I think one objective measure for the aesthetics of a given script is how much the people who actually use it day to day care about its presentation — which in turn could be measured by how prominent, prevalent and well developed the art of calligraphy is for that script&rdquo;</em>
Don&rsquo;t you think it should be possible to consider the aesthetics of the basic structure of lettershapes without considering their case-by-case execution? 
Besides, the aesthetic prevalence of calligraphy over other tools/executions really is in the eye of the beholder. FWIW, Burmese (which I mentioned) looks great to me (printed) even though –or maybe just because– it seems quite constructed and &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; in a way, not &ldquo;written&rdquo;. 
But I guess that&rsquo;s where personal taste comes in, since we&rsquo;re talking about aesthetics only. And that&rsquo;s one realm that I think has very few &ldquo;objective measures&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The initial question is a nice provocation. How to measure beauty, apart from heralding one’s personal preferences?
You can hardly compare Sinhala to Runes to Latin. And yet – we do ;-)
For me, the most beautiful alphabet is the classical one. And there is a classical style in Arabic, in Chinese, in Latin a.s.o. It may be interesting to compare these particular renderings of different scripts. One is likely to find as common features: the grown rather than the constructed (which means not: the curly rather than the straight!), a subtle detailing and balance between strenght and liveliness. When some do claim here, that they find Runes for instance rather not appealing, it may have something to do with the fact that the script hardly reached a matured state of classicism (Klassizität) in history. Which does not mean that it can’t reach that level at all.

<p>Indeed - and I think the main thing that can really threaten the Tibetan script is Western: chauvinistic and/or penny-pinching lack of proper support in software*. That sort of thing has caused wholesale abandonment of writing systems (for example emailing in Armenian is typically done via ad-hoc Latin transliteration) as well as debasing of scripts (as happened with the original Linotype&rsquo;s Arabic).</p>

<p>I was not talking about the Chinese being proud of their script &ndash; obviously, most people in the world are proud of their respective script. I was talking about the Chinese giving extra emphasis to &ndash; or one could say, being obsessed over &ndash; the aesthetics of their writings. In other words, there&rsquo;s a difference between interest in the function and being interest in the form (not that the two were mutually exclusive), while the former is universal, the latter is quantitatively unique to the Chinese. An intense obsession over the aesthetics, multiplied with the ancient age of the Chinese script, would suggest that there has been more cumulative effort in improving this script&rsquo;s beauty than any other script.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Regarding the future of Tibetan, we should separate the social and the technical aspect of its development. Socially, the script is undoubtedly dying &ndash; in that the number of people reading and writing it on a daily basis is decreasing. On the other hand, the vast majority of Tibetans were illiterate before the Communists came, so the number of Tibetan who&rsquo;re <em>able</em> to read and write Tibetan are most certainly a multitude of what it was back then.</p>
<p>Technically, as sii has noted above, the Chinese government has really done a lot of work for the development of &ldquo;minority languages&rdquo; such as Tibetan, both in classical terms &ndash; building dictionaries, creating language education programs, etc. &ndash; and in modern terms &ndash; pushing for digital standardization and international accessibility. For instance, because a fairly recent Chinese law demands that all computer OS sold in China to have display support the full range of the GB18030 encoding standard, the Chinese version of Windows comes with an font named &ldquo;SimSun (Founder Extended)&rdquo; that can display Tibetan. (However, I believe one still needs to activate the system support for &ldquo;complex script&rdquo;, which isn&rsquo;t activated by default in the Chinese version of Windows.)</p>

<p>The term ‘obsession’ is one that is also used to describe, not always uncritically, the Ottoman emphasis on the aesthetics of writing in the Arabic script. Our colleague Saad, for instance, regularly accuses the Ottomans of having made a ‘cult’ of calligraphic beauty.</p>

<p>I know, that&rsquo;s why applying the &ldquo;calligraphy test&rdquo;, I ranked Arabic second after Chinese. I also think the degree of calligraphic obsession can be plausibly explained by the systemic properties of the scripts themselves: As the only surviving ideographic script, Chinese has a higher complexity and thus a higher potential for calligraphic distortion than any alphabetic script. Among the alphabetic scripts, contextual scripts (or &ldquo;complex scripts&rdquo;) have the highest potential &ndash; like Arabic, or Tibetan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also argue that the strong presence of religion encourages calligraphy, because no other kind of texts is copied as often and held as highly as religious teachings. When you&rsquo;re copying the same text day in, day out, you&rsquo;d almost automatically start to pay attention to the aesthetics of your handwriting &ndash; and that of the original you&rsquo;re copying from, if only for some distraction. And because you hold the text highly, you feel a special drive to perfect its presentation. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that historically, a significant percentage of calligraphers &ndash; of all scripts &ndash; were monks.</p>
<p>@sii:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. Of course, at the time the law was enacted, there was no Windows Vista yet.</p>

<em>&ldquo;When some do claim here, that they find Runes for instance rather not appealing&rdquo;</em>
That would have been me (hallo, Herr Stötzner!). Yes, I found it difficult to think of an alphabet that wouldn&rsquo;t appeal very much to me personally, on a purely aesthetic level; the Futhark seemed to best fit the bill. I don&rsquo;t find it &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; per se, but less aesthetically/formally enticing than others.
Now on the level of <em>execution,</em> you certainly have a point when you say that &ldquo;the script hardly reached a matured state of classicism&rdquo; – of course its &ldquo;pre-classical&rdquo; (?) state explains some formal features that don&rsquo;t seem very &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; today (at least to me), like somewhat unbalanced proportions / shapes along with a usually rather crude execution. 
But to be honest, when I made that statement, I was trying to look past the execution, at the actual <em>structural vocabulary</em> of the lettershapes – and that&rsquo;s I guess where it really comes down to personal preference (I&rsquo;m personally not a huge fan of diagonal and spikey lettershapes, especially not when they dominate a script).* That sounds shallow, as well it is – but then this thread started out being just that. :-&gt;
And of course it doesn&rsquo;t mean that if I was in Scandinavia, running across some ancient Runic inscriptions, I wouldn&rsquo;t gasp with joy.</p>
<p>-Nina</p>
<ul>
<li>I suspect it might also have something to do with the way the individual lettershapes are combined into a system, but I can&rsquo;t do a full Futhark analysis at the moment as I&rsquo;m down with the flu &amp; my brain is not being very cooperative.</li>

<p>That is intriguing. Could you clarify what that &ldquo;touch&rdquo; is with some examples of success and failure in achieving it?</p>

It does look like the measles, it&rsquo;s true, but the Vietnamese have learnt to write it with the same beauty and care that they once bestowed on Chu Nom. I&rsquo;ve been trying to find out more about Vietnamese calligraphy in Quoc Ngu, but I&rsquo;ve not been able to find a single book on the subject (not one at SOAS library in London!), or even any high res examples. Can anybody help? If I just append some links below, you might end up agreeing with me that the world&rsquo;s most beautiful alphabet is that of Vietnamese!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.svcsaigon.com/index.php?thuphap=DetailView&amp;cid=742&amp;catid=23&amp;PHPSESSID=cbd09811f1f62dea953c3b9299a38f3e">http://www.svcsaigon.com/index.php?thuphap=DetailView&amp;cid=742&amp;catid=23&amp;PHPSESSID=cbd09811f1f62dea953c3b9299a38f3e</a></p>
<p>for example, or just Google Image &ldquo;thu phap&rdquo; (calligraphy), and there are just some wonderful results.</p>
<p>Turkish calligraphy has shown some similar developments - compare Emin Barın&rsquo;s awe-inspiring creations inspired by Ottoman forms and methods, but using modern Turkish letters.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t think so. The same regions of the brain are involved with sign language as in verbal language, and so it should be no different than a child learning two spoken languages simultaneously.</p>

<p>Despite our own Latin script having the upper-case and lower-case dichotomy to cope with, however, many very beautiful typefaces have been made for it. Thus, it may well be possible to make a beautiful typeface for the ancient Semitic (i.e. Phoenician) alphabet, even though it looks unprepossessing in the usual representation, made to resemble the way it looks in actual inscriptions.</p>
<p>The Tibetan writing system involves some quite complicated rules that seem bizarre to us, because they can lead to significant changes in the value of some consonants, but Tibetan follows its rules, which gives it an advantage over English.</p>

<p>My son is autistic and had no language ability until he was 4 years old. Just before that, we began to teach him a few signs.  Somehow, the digital manipulation in signing made a connection to verbal areas of the brain. He began to speak and signing was a big help&ndash;if not the cause or catalyst that bridged the divide for him.</p>

<p>I was looking on YouTube for any examples of Malayalam music where the name of the video was in Malayalam. But it seemed like in all cases, the videos were in English. (Of course, unlike Malayalam, English is an official language in India, and it is the one widely used in Kerala, the home of Malayalam, since Malalam is a Dravidian language, and thus not closely related to Hindi.)</p>
<p>The only videos I found with Malayalam titles at first seemed to be someone&rsquo;s baby pictures, but I suspect they were of children available for adoption.</p>
<p>As for Tibetan specifically, while the Chinese are preserving it in some ways, the economic and educational dominance of Mandarin is still a threat to the long-term survival of the Tibetan language.</p>
