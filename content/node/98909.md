  body: Apparently PowerPoint is affected in presentation mode only. Extra dangerous
    as one could not know there was a problem until trying to actually present. Ouch.

    and installed several things. Just came across your this thread and knew the reason
    of the problem. My all documents formatting appeared to be destroyed in MS Word
    2010. \r\nAfter reading this I also uninstalled all the updates along with the
    above mentioned one and re-installed the MS Word 2010 but in vain. \r\nI have
    to wait a few days and see if Microsoft releases any fix. The other way is to
    re-install Windows XP and every thing, quite a long work.\r\nMZ,"

  body: Bear in mind, this isn't the first Windows update to fix security bugs in
    its font-handling code, apparently it's just the first one to break functionality.
    And from what I can gather, this latest vulnerability [[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-078|affects
    TrueType fonts as well]]; the update only breaks OTF fonts since they typically
    use a different system rasterizer and API call. But the overall threat does seem
    more serious now that every major browser supports webfonts, so simply visiting
    a website could load a malicious font.

    I think that's trowing the baby out wit da bat water. I'm sure they'll fix it
    soon, with the main reason to support .otf on windows being issues concerning
    screen rendering of .ttfs.\r\n\r\nThese font security patches sure are important
    to keep us all safe from malicious fonts.  "
