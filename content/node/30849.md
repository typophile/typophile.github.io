    not, I'd rethink the name. ;o)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, as Conor points out, you can't
    use punctuation (other than a dash) in an URL, so you definitely would not want
    to use the brackets if the company name is the same as their URL.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That is the company, they liked the Brace direction because clients often
    refer to the co. as \"focus\" web, so they wanted to emphasize the word. They
    are not worried about the url with the braces. Though they were warned when the
    originally chose this direction.\r\n\r\nThe argument with the braces is that we
    will include the real URL with all of the printed and web materials. \r\n\r\n.
    . . would it be a better move to remove the .com? They originally used thier legal
    name with ,inc. That would solve the brace issue with the URL however I felt that
    the .com helped identify the company. \r\n\r\n. . . \r\n\r\nThe client wants a
    blue for the logo, or combination there of. However they also want the logo for
    the website to reside in a traditional web 2.0 heavy gradient top bar. . . This
    is where I start to draw colour blanks.\r\n\r\n"

    That way, perhaps the viewer would see them more as a design element rather than
    part of the URL.\r\nDB~"

  body: "You always see Web 2.0 logos using shiny clear \"iMac\" colours with white
    highlights on them. It would be interesting to see some different lighting effects
    - maybe blue with a lavender toplight and a cyan fill light, or something like
    that.\r\n\r\nAs for specific colours, I'd suggest coming up with different variations
    and seeing which looks best.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    IDs it as a URL. And since it's not a URL (because of the brackets) it's confusing."

  body: "First off, I like your design. I'm not an authority, but I think the .com
    has a stigma attached to it because of all the other independent \".coms\" out
    there. Notice that all of the biggest internet companies don't have .com attached:
    Google, Yahoo, AOL, etc. Most people assume (many times wrongfully) that the URL
    is companyname.com, so in this case, they would be right and you have nothing
    to worry about. Additionally, the \"Web\" part gives away that it's a website,
    so it's somewhat redundant.\r\n\r\nAs for the braces, IMHO, I don't think they
    matter because people will know it's not part of the company name (they wouldn't
    say, \"Let's give 'Brace Focused Brace Web dot Com' a call!\")\r\n\r\nAnd lastly,
    I like blue for the color - just make it a bright blue and not the typical navy
    of startup .coms.\r\n\r\n-Scott\r\n\r\nPS: You could make a scribble on paper
    and it would be better than their current logo (no offense if the designer reads
    this). A swoosh and a globe all in one!? Beautiful! ;)"

    that they needed a new look and web page. . . so thats what I get to do for the
    time being. Ill keep posting the progress. Your comments are much appreciated.
    \r\n\r\nI started going with the glowly apple aqua gel text and scratched it.
    Just a little lame. Specially for reproduction and print purposes. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames"
