  <BR> <BR>Subject: herbal remedies and &#34;high-tech&#34; aromatherapy techniques
  <BR> <BR>My client wants a &#34;modern and high-tech&#34; look, which I will achieve
  partly through layout and secondary fonts. <BR> <BR>Text fonts I&#39;m currently
  considering include: Scala, Raleigh, Stone, Minion, Apollo <BR> <BR>I would consider
  others, but price may be an issue if a given font is expensive for my client. <BR>
  <BR>Any recommendations or analyses of these fonts&#39; strengths is appreciated.

  body: Scala is OK, although overused. <BR>Don&#39;t use Raleigh or Stone. Please.
    <BR>Minion is boring &#40;except if you&#39;re gonna milk its MM axes&#41;. <BR>Apollo
    is an interesting departure, but too stodgy here. <BR> <BR>To me &#34;modern and
    high-tech&#34; implies a certain honest, rigid feel, so I would go with a wedge
    serif design, like FF Zine, Foundry Form Serif or FF Olson. If your text will
    be smallish, consider Swift as well. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'I have to point out that this sort of thing is a little like going on-line
    and saying &#34;I have a fever, my throat is sore, and I have small rashes on
    my skin. What would you guys recommend that I take for it?&#34; Beware any diagnosis
    over the internet. <BR> <BR>Obviously, there&#39;s a lot more to choosing a book
    face than just what looks interesting. And without a lot more details about the
    book brief &#40;&#39;modern and high-tech&#39; are very vague terms and could
    mean a lot of different things to different people, including your client, these
    suggestions are only stabs in the dark. <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, let me offer my
    two cents&#39; worth: <BR> <BR>Scala has turned out to be a decent face in books.
    It&#39;s spareness gives a character that many would characterize as contemporary.
    As Hrant points out, the downside is that it is a bit heavily exposed right now
    -- but that&#39;s not really a primary consideration in book text. I have found
    it tricky to pair a good display with it because of it&#39;s idiosyncracies. And
    although I&#39;ve considered it for a couple jobs before, I&#39;ve yet to actually
    decide to use it. <BR> <BR>Stone and Minion are both solid workhorses. I&#39;ve
    used both with success. &#40;I just finished a book with Stone&#41;. But I suspect
    neither is unique enough to give the character that your client seems to be requesting.
    <BR> <BR>Apollo is a good text face, although I find setting it requires a little
    more care in handling. Utopia and Kepler both set well right out of the box. Although
    all three are more unique, uncommon choices, I don&#39;t think any of these are
    going to give the character you want. I think they&#39;re all a little too soft
    and classical in feeling for what you&#39;re describing. Apollo feels very oldstyle
    and usually gives a delicate text. Utopia yields a fairly dark setting and seems
    a bit too squarish for what I think you might be after -- it seems better suited
    to manuals and textbooks than trade books. Kepler is a nice readable Didone, being
    a more jovial take on the class, but I don&#39;t think it is sharp enough to convey
    &#34;modern, high-tech&#34; &#40;whatever that actually means&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I
    haven&#39;t worked with Avance or the other FF faces mentioned, so I can&#39;t
    speak from direct experience. I think Avance might make a nice text, but it does
    seem a little congenial for your title. I don&#39;t think I could advise either
    Olsen or Zine as book faces. Olsen is very monotone and the x-height seems too
    large for extended text; I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a fine &#39;jobbing&#39; face.
    Zine looks interesting, but I only see a Display cut, which is too narrow for
    book text in my opinion. &#40;I hope Sch'

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I agree with Hrant, there&#39;s something really fishy
    with those pulpy terminals. I designed a book last year and ITC Stone was forced
    upon me by the corporate style manual. And to top it all off, I had to use Helvetica
    for headlines! Me, using ITC Stone <i>AND</i> Helvetica on the same job! Argh...
    &#40;The book was a success though. Oh, the irony of it all.&#41;
