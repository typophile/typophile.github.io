Is there anyone that has suggestions as to where I can start to find some information about this?  What are the tools people usually use for this?

		<div class="commentbody">Twenty-plus years ago, the Chyron IV character generator used by many television stations had a function for creating true pixel fonts, but that technology has long since been eclipsed. Nowadays, I am reasonably confident that all of the pixel typefaces you see are TTF, PS1 or OT fonts that have been designed to reproduce cleanly without antialiasing.

Here are a few tricks for creating a workable pixel font:

1) Work with a clearly defined grid: 7x7 is probably the smallest workable area.

2) The smallest design unit is a true square. All other elements will be composed of whole-number multiples of the height or the width of that square.

3) Have fun and take chances.

If you would prefer not to re-invent the whell, there are a lot of serviceable and clever examples already available: <a href="http://dafont.com/en/author.php?author=308" target="_blank">Yuji Adachi</a> is one of my favorite pixelware designers.</div>

Superhinted TT fonts (like the previous generation of the MS core fonts) are this sort of thing. But they take a lot of effort. Which is why so many people now make what are called "pixelfonts", which has come to mean something different than "bitmap font", because it involves the use of an outline font to map pixels to a "virtual grid" - basically little outline blocks of one sort or another that map to exact bitmaps at a certain point size. The main reasons for this are that: Flash didn't support "true" bitmap fonts; and increasing (like MacOS now) bitmap fonts are not [properly] supported. Furthermore, if you want to handmake <strong>grayscale</strong> bitmap fonts (which I've been doing) you can only do it through pixelfonts (at least robustly and portably).

But please don't make really small pixelfonts! We have too many, and their expressiveness is necessarily in proportion to their unreadability.

Except if you make grayscale ones...

Yes!

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Hrant, for the additions and clarifications. I hate to see questions go unanswered:, if I can offer even a small morsel of information, I go ahead and do so, because...

1) If I'm wrong, I am confident that someone will contradict me (like a duck on a Junebug, as we used to say in Texas); and

2) I am not afraid of being wrong. I have been <strong>very</strong> wrong about some things in the past (like, I voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980), and will doubtless be wrong many times in the future (but, hopefully, never <em>that</em> wrong).</div>
