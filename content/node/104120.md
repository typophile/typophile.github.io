  body: "In a sentence: it's how the stroke is modulated. :)\r\n\r\nIn a simple way,
    let's say that a \"calligraphic\" font tries to emulate a nib or other writing
    tool, while \"geometric\" is a rationalization of the letter's shape.\r\n\r\nWith
    that said, the calligraphic letter considers the imprint that a writing tool would
    leave, a.i. the stroke, while the geometric letter considers the geometric reduction
    of it's outlines. So one is written, the other is rigorously drawn.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the dots, the same thing: is it the register of a writing tool or a geometrization
    of the outlines? And, by the way, the advantages are none, nor the disadvantages:
    it's just an aesthetic choice.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
