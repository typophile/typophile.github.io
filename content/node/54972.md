  body: Bodoni had a foundry in his name, but I doubt that he would have called any
    of his fonts after himself. In the old days the name of anything was more likely
    to be the patron's rather than the creator's. Perhaps Didot or Baskerville?

  body: Baskerville was still too early; the idea of naming a font beyond Roman, Italic,
    Black, etc., didn't really happen until the industry became globally competitive.
    It might have been Eckmann in 1901. If not, it was probably Goudy. But "started
    the trend" is probably the wrong thing to call it, because by that point, there
    had been so many prominent type makers that it sort of happened by itself.

  body: If it is Eckmann or Goudy, it seems surprising that it would take until the
    late 19th, early 20th century for a type designer to do this. I'm sure it was
    seen as an egotistical thing at first though. Perhaps that's why it may have taken
    so long after the invention of movable type?

  body: "I think the names of Grasset, Auriol, Eckmann and Behrens are all right.
    But it was the founders who did the naming. And I think it is no coincidence that
    they all happen at once. These designs are examples of what Tschichold, in his
    austere modernist mode, called \u2018artists\u2019 typefaces\u2019. They already
    had a high profile in the graphic arts, so it was a good move on the part of the
    founders to exploit their distinctive lettering as type, and call it by their
    names. I think it\u2019s best to see these \u2018designer\u2019 faces in the new
    and very competitive context of type-making of the early 20th century, when the
    founders, threatened by the Linotype, felt a need to market their large bodied
    faces more aggressively. And in both France and Germany the marketing included
    a pretty powerful charge of national feeling.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Grasset

    seems to me that the first instincts of Morris Fuller Benton took him in a different
    direction. He developed an impersonal design with the bland name of \u2018Cheltenham\u2019
    (the type that resulted is a long way from the lively original sketches by Goodhue)
    and then marketed all the variations that were made in house as members of a must-have
    \u2018family\u2019 of designs, like Cheltenham Condensed, Cheltenham Bold, Cheltenham
    Bold Expanded, and so on. But since ATF\u2019s  \u2018classic\u2019 names like
    \u2018Bodoni\u2019 and \u2018Garamond\u2019 sold pretty well too, they marketed
    the designs they bought from Goudy (and to which they gave a slick, professional
    ATF treatment, rather to his irritation) as \u2018The Goudy Family\u2019. And
    of course Barnhart Brothers and Spindler, who stayed independent from ATF, exploited
    the name of their one star in-house designer Oz Cooper, as in Cooper Black. \u2018Star\u2019
    as in Hollywood, of course, which led the way.\r\n\r\nApart from Gill (a special
    case) English Monotype mostly stayed with high-profile classics, like Garamond,
    Baskerville and Fournier. Being dead they did not ask for royalties.\r\n"

    what in France would called a \u2018look\u2019: an overall concept that covered

    16th-century types, for which he had matrices.\r\n\r\nI've been trying argue recently

    reproduction rather than cutting every letter in metal by hand in the original
    size. And they drew them very well. Goudy's pupils in Chicago, Oz Cooper and W.
    A. Dwiggins, didn't do badly. The results were simpler type designs that could
    be made with Benton's new pantographic technology. \r\n\r\nAnd since \u2013 as
    we know because he took good care to tell us \u2013 Goudy not only sold designs
    to the type makers but made several of them himself, cutting his own pattern letters
    in cardboard, he wanted, understandably, to promote his own name. Unlike Grasset
    and Eckmann, fine artists whose names promoted their types. Making your own types
    at home and selling them. What an unheard of thing to do."

    type would have been named for the ruler or official that commissioned it, not
    the designers who did the work.</cite>\r\n\r\nHere's what I can find about names
    of Korean typefaces.\r\n\r\nTypefaces that were commissioned by the Korean court
    were typically named after the name of the year in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagenary_cycle\">sexagenary
    cycle</a>. For instance, Gabinja was made in 1434, which was a <em>gabin</em>
    (\u7532\u5BC5) or a 'yang wood tiger' year, and Gyemija was made in 1404, which
    was a <em>gyemi</em> (\u7678\u672A) or a 'yin water sheep' year.\r\n\r\nByeongjinja,
    made in 1436, a <em>byeongjin</em> (\u4E19\u8FB0) year, is also known as Gangmok
    Daeja because it was used for the big (<em>dae</em>) letters in the <em>gangmok</em>
    (\u7DB1\u76EE) style texts, which mixes two sizes of letters. It is also known
    as Jinyangdaegunja, because it was based on letters written by Grand Prince Jinyang
    (Jinyang Daegun).\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other cases where typefaces are
    known by those whose lettering they are based on; Gabinja was also known as Wibuinja
    based on a false attribution of the letters to Madam Wei (\u885B\u592B\u4EBA,
    <em>Wi Buin</em> in Korean), a Chinese calligrapher. Gabinja was actually based
    on the letters found in a number of books deemed to have beautiful lettering in
    the style of Zhao Mengfu another Chinese calligrapher, with Grand Prince Jinyang
    supplying the missing letters.\r\n\r\nHanguja was a typeface made in 1677 based
    on the letters written by Han Gu, a noted calligrapher of the time.\r\n\r\nThere
    are also typefaces known by the names of the publications they were used to print,
    or by the name of the person in charge of making them, especially if they were
    not commissioned by the court but by private individuals. Yulgokjeonseoja was
    made by a group of private individuals to print the <em>Yulgok Seonsaeng Jeonseo</em>
    (The Complete Works of Yi I, also known as Yulgok), and it is sometimes known
    as Honggyehuija after Hong Gyehui, one of its principal commissioners. I'm not
    sure if these names were given at the time they were made or later by type historians.\r\n\r\nAll
    the typefaces I mentioned are those used for Chinese characters. Typefaces for
    the Korean alphabet don't seem to have been given separate names at the time."
