body: "I've been doing some layout work for an organisation. Most of the material
  produced by this organisation is in the Sami language which use characters as \u010C\u010D
  \u0110\u0111 \u0166\u0167 \u014A\u014B \u0160\u0161 \u017D\u017E...\r\n<!--break-->\r\nMost
  of these glyphs can not be represented by any version of ITC Avant Garde or Helvetica
  Neue I've found, and those are the official typefaces as dictated by the spanking
  new graphical profile that was handed to me. Kind of odd that this didn't occur
  to whoever designed the profile. I'd certainly want my money back... but that's
  not my problem.\r\n\r\nI'm just about sawwy enough to produce my own variants of
  these fonts so I can draw the glyphs without too much trouble, but what I'd really
  like to do is make templates so that my customer can produce simple letters without
  having to contact their favourite design bureau. This obviously involves  spreading
  derivatives of typefaces licensed by the mighty adobe. \r\n\r\nWhat legal considerations
  are there? Am I correct to assume that I can charge for providing a variation of
  a typeface, and that it is up to whoever uses it to acquire licence to use the base
  typeface?"

  body: "It all looked a bit grim, until you mentioned that every user has a license
    to these fonts obtained directly from Adobe. Adobe\u2019s font EULA is quite liberal
    and their licensing FAQ even more so. Have your attorney take a look at those
    documents and they should be able to determine if the proposed modification, charges
    and distribution are okay."

    just saying... :) Appreciated though, sure saved me a lot of work.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/savant_4880.png]\r\nIt's
    good to have these issues sorted out. It's not the first time I've thought of
    modifying typefaces for customers. I think the point is that if the license state
    that you can alter the font for personal use, you can also hire someone to do
    the modifications. See [[http://www.adobe.com/type/topics/licenseqa.html#q25]]
    for example. Hope I've got the meaning of  \"personal use\" right in this context. "
