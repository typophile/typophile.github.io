<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello everybody, this is my first contact and I would like to have your critique for a font i started to work on. I applied the characters on the clich&#233; phrase "the brown fox..." and to a logo (the logo is fiction, just to try the types). For the moment i have designed just the lowercase, and in the future i will plus greek letters (i am from Greece). <br>I would appreciate it if you could give me your views plus I would be greatfull to receive some methodological informations on how to develop my work. <br> <br>thank you <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif alt=sample1.gif> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif alt=logo.gif></div>

<div class=commentbody> some good things are happening here. i like the descender on the 'h', but it feels heavy, perhaps angle/corner it such as 'f' and 'k', but in the direction of the latter. does the 'e' or 'z' feel weird? hmmm </div>

<div class=commentbody> 1. v is a little too close to u for my liking. <br>2. serifs seem to have 2 variations..slabbing and spiked - any reason? <br>3. and like John said decenders - cut them all or don't cut at all. </div>

<div class=commentbody> Thank you John for your notices, I overlooked on the letters you mentioned and i think you are right. So, i expanded a little bit the horizontal stems of "e" and I applied the diagonal cut edge on the descender of "h". The problem is still with "z" and is called "diagonal stem"...you see in none of the types i used diagonal stems, so i tried to keep a vertical stem for "z", too. To be honest, now that i used it i like it and i think it fits between the neighbooring types, but still there are no other angled stems around, so is this convinient? I tried also a "z" with descender, but maybe this is too strange and i want to know if it is legible to you, beyond any historical taboos...thanks again for your advices <br> <br>...i just read your notes Tanya, i will try them later. <br> <br>\image-(sample2) </div>

<div class=commentbody> there is something about this that i really like. <br>I wouldlike to see each letter have and use the same forms. for example the "a" and the "d" have all the elements a sharp point, a curvy serif, and a rounded center. while the "h" and the "u" are missing the rounded center, the "z" is missing the sharp point an </div>
