  photography business. His business is called Knox Photography. Right now I've decided
  to use Baskerville as the main font, but am trying to find a good font pair to use
  with it. I really like Gotham, but am not sure if it's completely appropriate? I'm
  looking leaning more towards a geometrical sans serif font.\r\n\r\nI've attached
  an image of a quick throw together of what I'm thinking of. Right now I'm purely
  focusing more on finding the right fonts than on the logos design. Currently the
  image is set with Baskerville and Avenir.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

    intangible for decent designers.\r\n\r\nFutura and Gotham are fine faces, yet
    desperately over-used.\r\n\r\n\r\nLook for alternatives. You may consider e.g.
    Brandon, Avenir, Mostra (Nuova), Eagle, Kabel, Le Havre or, if modesty allows,
    \r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lapidaria/|Lapidaria]].\r\nGood
    luck!"

    completely agree with your comment, and that's why I wanted to look for an alternative.
    Thanks for the suggestions, I'll look into them!"

  body: Unless I'm mistaken, the word on the street is that H&FJ are going to be releasing
    Ideal Sans this week. It's a humanist sans, but it may work very well with what
    you're building. To get a feel for the flavor, see their <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100025">Topaz</a>
    (the 'background' and 'inline' variations, not the default built-in inline version).
    Ideal Sans is built from the outlines of Topaz (or maybe it was the other way
    around, considering Ideal was originally designed some 20+ years ago). Good luck!
