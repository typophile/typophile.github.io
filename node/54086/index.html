		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Ashfaq with Flowers. KFGQPC is less than expected!
Kerning + Ligatures have been sacrificed for mark-positioning.
Moreover, some letter connections appear as if kashidas were added.
Though there is a trade-off among them, but it could have been done better.

As you can easily see, there is no middle ligatures at all.
And most essential initial+final ligatures are missing.

Wait for our Naskh that will be included in MirEmad of MaryamSoft 
and the comparison  I will make between the 2 here and then.

We dont try to make this font for look like straight font, like others, We try to make its best use without kashidas. Can u plz give me an example which essential Initial+final ligatures are missing.
In pure Naskh the Calligrapher accepts only these ligatures which I've added. May be u are asking for the ligatures to make the font something similar like Nastaleeq.
What do u mean by "letter connections appear as if Kashidas were added", can u send me a Print.

Target+shoot slightly to the left of the middle?!


@ ... an example which essential Initial+final ligatures are missing.

Possible combinations with the flower h, meem + the sea-horses (kh+sisters).

As an example, just write KO and look at the line made between them,
do not you see that the line would look better if shortened?!

OK, my question is about the glyph FDFA. صلى الله عليه وسلم . I did a magnification to this glyph and see a poor design. Perhaps the designer limits the type size and does not think about magnification... However, as he advertises about it as the best Naskh people will use it in big size works as in advertisement, signage, etc.

My question is why this type is not clean enough as it is claimed as the best one in Naskh...

U are making PDF or JPG in very poor resolution and getting very bad result. As Aziz says, when u increase resolution u will get an extra ordinary Quality.
Regarding the Mark Positioning, when u type fathatan on Noon, it will appear on noon, if u need Fathatan to be appear like the above image, type fathatan on final Alif, it will appear like above shape.

Democratically speaking, people will repeat what you claim because
majority of people do not know Ligatures + Kerning in Typography,
though, admittedly, they practice both techniques as instilled in them
by their Creator?!

I did not check what Aratype posted.

@ Aratype, nothing wrong with the font and it is better than Lotus of Linotype.

I am speaking from typesetting point of view! This font may be excellent, however my issues are in the typesetting area and I am comparing the font with Lotus.

To be honest, what I do not like is to announce a chef-d'oeuvre and to find a lot of typesetting issues. If Ashfaq needs only for congratulations it will arrive after the font's definitive version...

		<div class="commentbody">Well Aratype, both positions produce unhappy Typography/Calligraphy.
Fortunately, the smart MirEmad of MaryamSoft.com does: 
1. place a longer Fatha spanning the Lam, and Shadda at the middle of Fatha.
2. place the combination (Shadda+fatha) approximately between the red+green?

Regarding the dots position, I use much more than 2 levels. I've in my mind just try to save the dots and Diacritics Clashes. As you say, its flexible and can be adjusted. If serious users dont like it we can adjust them.</div>
