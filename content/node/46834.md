  like some kind of Century (Expanded), but none of the digital versions I've seen
  capture it very well at all. Any certainty, corrections, or suggestions for something
  similar? (Also open to very elegant modern versions of a typeface of this character.)\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "You've got at least two typefaces here, and I don't either one is Century.\r\n\r\n\"Review\"
    looks like a Scotch or Transitional face. Caledonia would have been an option
    in '66; Miller (from Font Bureau) is a modern interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe small
    roman type (along with the numbers and small caps) looks like a version of Baskerville.
    Not sure about the italics, though."

  body: "\"Review\" might be a display weight of Baskerville with a curvy 'R'. Not
    sure if this exists, but \"eview\" looks Baskervillesque.\r\n\r\nI think the italic
    might be Monotype Garamond Bold Italic.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "\"Review\" looks like Bulmer to me. It seems too bold, but that may be because
    it was enlarged from a smaller size.\r\n\r\nThe italic at the bottom is Ludlow
    Garamond Bold Italic. <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/GaramondFB\">Garamond
    FB</a> was based on it.\r\n\r\nThe rest appears to be Baskerville."
