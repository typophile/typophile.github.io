  body: Is it a logo? The r might have been manipulated. The rest of the characters
    are consistent with Perpetua

  body: "This is interesting. The \"r\" is \"wrong\", but it's also very \"right\",
    having a beak archetypical of Gill (designer of Perpetua). I'm guessing it is
    indeed a Perpetua mod, done by somebody quite sensitive. Alternatively, it's possible
    Perpetua had such an alternate \"r\" in its original metal version, and this logo
    is that old.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Nicely put. When I get around to showing what I am finding in my contextual
    altrenate research the r is going to be pretty important.

  body: "Thanks for the input. I'm pretty sure of a few things: the logo is very new,
    and definitely not created with an original metal version.\r\n\r\nThe designer
    of the logo, based on other work I've seen, would definitely not be sensitive
    enough to add such a minor typographic alternate by hand."

  body: "The only other decent possibility I can think of is that the designer casually
    used a font derivative of Perpetua, done by a sensitive type designer. On the
    other hand, a type designer sensitive to letterform lineage is unlikely to be
    insensitive to rights issues! Plus a sensitive type designer wouldn't charge low
    enough for an insensitive type user...  Maybe the user has a type designer friend,
    and he called in a favor? This is getting deeper and deeper into guesswork...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    designer did infact mean to extend the extra beak of the r.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hm_topimglogo_5522.gif]\r\n\r\nFrom

    duh!", when the answer was posted. But, for the life of me, I can't find it.
