  that it is as strong as it could be. I would really like to recieve some feedback
  on Eggman, my first font. <BR> <BR>{<A HREF="http://www.uwm.edu/~timdd/eggman.gif"

  body: ' Tim - Welcome to the forum. This is indeed fun and quirky and could have
    a lot of specialty uses.  <BR> <BR>Some things that I think you can do right off
    the bat to make it work better... <BR> <BR>Try to bring the widths and weights
    closer together. When you test this with sample words and phrases, you might get
    a uneveness that you weren&#39;t intending.  <BR> <BR>For example, the bowl on
    lc &#39;q&#39;, the thin lc &#39;l&#39;, the thick uc &#39;F&#39;, when brought
    together might jar a bit. But maybe that&#39;s your intention.  <BR> <BR>As far
    as weights, the lc &#39;m&#39; and lc &#39;h&#39; seem exaggeratedly thin, the
    lc &#39;e&#39; and &#39;u&#39; seem a little fat. <BR> <BR>My favorite letter
    is the lc &#39;g&#39;.  My least favorite are the lc &#39;u&#39; and the uc &#39;U&#39;
    -- I would look at the triangle shape that develops. <BR> <BR>The best designers
    at nailing these kind of fonts:  One Way Out. I don&#39;t have the link, but if
    you go to MacSurfShop.com, I think you can find a link there. They used to distribute
    through t26 and now they sell mostly to religious organizations. <BR> <BR>One
    Way Out fonts are quirky, but magically delicious. <BR> <BR>good luck <BR> <BR>bj '
