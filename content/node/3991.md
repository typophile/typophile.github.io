  book type, as well as all ranges of styles &#40;old style, egyptian, modern, postmodern,
  etc&#41;. for more information, visit <a href="http://www.revolmag.com" target="_blank">www.revolmag.com</a>

  body: Dante - I like your magazine. I hope you don&#39;t mind a few <BR>small criticisms.
    <BR> <BR>- This type of medium &#40;double page clickthru mag&#41; is mostly <BR>wonderful.
    I like that it allows the viewer to focus on each piece <BR>without distraction.
    But what&#39;s common among all of the mags <BR>of this type is that it&#39;s
    not easy to get at the artist credits. For <BR>example, I&#39;m looking at the
    work and I&#39;ve clicked by the author <BR>intro page and then I hit something
    I love. I have to page back <BR>to see who it is. Would it be too intrusive to
    add a small note <BR>below the magazine &#34;frame&#34; with the current artist
    info? <BR> <BR>- Revol and <a href="http://www.contributemagazine.com/" target="_blank">Contribute</a>
    both share unfortunately messy tables of <BR>contents. If the artists are the
    most important part of the <BR>publication, why not make their names and info
    as readable <BR>as possible? <BR> <BR>- Do you provide links to contributors&#39;
    personal sites? If there <BR>are, I missed them. <BR> <BR>Overall, nice work.
    &#40;I like the logo, I&#39;m a sucker for antlers.&#41;
