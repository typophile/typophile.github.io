    them, i.e. the ripoffs.

    who don't know any better than to think it is a great buy. \r\n\r\nThen again,
    I have found a really creative person can take junk and make magic out of it.I
    bet if we had a contest to see who could make something cool out of an inlined,
    outlined, spotted, mangled, back-slanted font, someone would knock it out of the
    park. \r\n\r\nOh well, life goes on...\r\n\r\n(edit)"

  body: It's not too different from getting thousands of clip art images for a ridiculous
    price, is it? Someone had to <em>draw</em> (or at least trace) all of those images...
    Yes, life goes on... and it gets cheapened, too.  :-/

    expects clip art to suck, when it doesn\u2019t people assume it\u2019s a commissioned
    illustration (at least I do). I think that there\u2019s an innate expectation,
    or even assumption, of legibility and thus quality when it comes to letters."

  body: You could be right about that, James... Another area in which work is cheapened
    is stock photography... Do people expect <em>that</em> to suck? I know of good
    photographers who have to make a living and end up submitting their work to stock
    houses...
