  body: "Berthold Baskerville Book appears to be a good option to recreate most of
    this (if it was indeed typeset in 1969), but it doesn't have non-aligning figures.
    \r\n\r\nIt does have a 2 with an upward-pointing serif at the foot, and a C with
    two serifs, which some of the other versions of Baskerville do not.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/baskerville-book-be/\r\n\r\nIf
    you want the non-aligning numerals and don't mind a 2 with a slightly different
    serif and a bit more of a loop, then ITC New Baskerville isn't bad:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-new-baskerville/"
