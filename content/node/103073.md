  body: Changing to another version of Windows or to the Mac or to Linux will change
    nothing if the problem is due to too many kerning pairs, or overflowing tables
    etc. The limitation comes from the original specification of the font files (truetype
    or opentype); with Fontlab, you would just get another message (that might be
    more meaningful to those populating this site).

    can create another table and move some of the lookup in it. Will that solve the
    problem?"

  body: For the time being you have 2000 glyphs whose name is 98 characters long.
    You probably need first solve that problem; I have no experience whatsoever with
    a what you are trying to do.

  body: How do I rename a glyph in fontforge. There is one glyph which show no combination
    and it does not have any name. How do I add combination. Before that I have to
    give a name to that glyph.

    scripts. Renaming is also easy with scripts.
