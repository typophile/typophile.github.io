  ones proofing the files, so I am here looking for printer recs out there.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone based in LA have any good recs, ideally in this part of town (or any part
  of town, as long as you think they are great...especially for stationery systems
  and folded brochures...)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJean"
