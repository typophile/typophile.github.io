body: Hi I'm currently working on a project that involves gathering togather a number
  of different typefaces from 1600 to the present day. There are 17 regular intervals
  to be filled and I'm having trouble with the last few - wondered if anyone had any
  suggestions? the periods left are 1600, 1620, 1640, 1670, 1830 and 1850. thanks!
