  body: My first impression is that the bubbles and boxes in the first three logos
    are a bit too tiny and insignificant... What would these logos look like in black
    and white, or at very small sizes? They might become indecipherable. Same goes
    for the last concept... Plus, the arrow and the check mark seem to be at odds,
    and I'm not sure the bolder "O" helps.

  body: "Are the bubbles soda fizz? I'm not clear from the logo if you're a graphic
    designer or a mad scientist. And the arrow pointing in to the \"out\" seems confusing.
    \r\n\r\nI don't mind the \"box as O\" treatment, but the rest needs more work."

  body: That's fair, speter. The bubbles kind of abstractly evolved from the idea
    of thought bubbles, thinking, creating, etc. Plus, I wanted to keep the shapes
    simple. In early sketches, I had the word "creative" coming out of the box, but
    I just couldn't get it to a place where it didn't look silly. I will keep working,
    but please keep the comments coming...

  body: "I prefer no.10 & no. 15\r\n\r\nin No.10 .......... try to make the bubbles
    .... a complete O .... maybe solid color so it doesnt look like a fuzzy drink
    as speter said\r\n\r\navoid the open O ... i think it is complicated "

  body: "The name OUTBOX sends a message about the value you bring to your clients,
    and the way you play with the letterforms sends a message too. Are they the same
    message? \"Outbox\" could mean:\r\n* I'm an edgy, outside-the-box thinker.\r\n*
    I'll get your job finished (i.e., in the \"out\" box) quickly and efficiently.\r\nMake
    your visual reinforce the message."

  body: Mojo, I actually chose the name for that precise double meaning. Do you have
    any specific thoughts on what my current letterforms are expressing, and how I
    can get them closer to the intended meanings? I'm no type expert for sure, which
    is why I posted here for advice. Thank you!

  body: "That's Mr. Mojo to you ;-)\r\nThe way you made one of the O's into a square
    gives me an idea. What if you made them both into squares? An empty in-box and
    an out-box that has your successful solution in it:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/outbox_6327.JPG]"

  body: 'Thanks for showing how you arrived at these concepts. It''s always good to
    see the process. And I like # 15 too! As well as # 19... (In those, the focus
    is on one single graphic element.) I agree with PM about making both O''s a into
    a box, if you go with that idea.'

  body: Gill Sans doesn't really strike me as very creative. So on that front you
    can probably also improve the design. For the rest, I would increase the space
    between the words 'outbox' and 'creative'. I think it's too close to each other
    now, which could be a problem if the logo is printed at small sizes, or at small
    sizes on screen.
