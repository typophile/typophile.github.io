  oppulent, luxurios etc.  I'm trying something with letters that weave in and out
  of each other\r\n\r\nYou know, kind of like the TDC logo, but in a straight line.
  \ And a little more elegant.\r\n\r\nThe letters are \"PBS\"\r\n\r\nI started sketching
  the idea\r\n\r\nI originally was using baskerville, but its too heavy to properly
  interweave the characters with each other.\r\n\r\nAny advice?\r\n\r\n"

    to PBS might be the first order.

    of the three principals of the company.  Very corporate.\r\n\r\nI just need to
    find the right typeface that will work well with the sketch I did.  It might just
    come down to me devloping the logo by hand"

  body: Well, it might just be that knowing about typefaces, their relationships,
    positioning, etc. is part of the qualification of a designer?

  body: "A designer is one who understands when to do what where with whom how and
    why. So you are way out of line, paragraph.\r\n\r\nAndrew, \r\nYou need a font
    with not to many thicks and thins and some jaunty serifs. A little of personality
    for each of them ideally. I would suggest you go find some examples of old wood
    type (think dada-esque) and just rifle through till you find \"the one\". I don't
    know where in your town you might be able to do that, but that's where you step
    in. Am I on the right track?"

  body: "The font that immediately sprang to mind seeing your sketch was Parsons,
    available in digital form as <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/parsnip-nf/\">Parsnip
    NF</a>. This will give you a very old-school flavor, perhaps not what you're looking
    for.\r\n\r\nIn the original, there are lots of alternate characters and long extenders,
    but none for the caps P, B, and S specifically. In general, that kind of thing
    would make it easier to weave.\r\n\r\nProbably just a wacky idea, but maybe it
    leads you somewhere."

    the business owner trying to avoid hiring a designer, not a designer struggling
    with a job. Good luck.
