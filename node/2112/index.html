		<div class="commentbody">Hey, stop blaming the font! <BR>What would be of more use for legibility would be a &#34;shizzolator&#34; that rewrote text to avoid visually ambiguous/difficult words.   <BR> <BR>For instance, Clearview has the commonplace &#34;modern/modem&#34; problem with the &#34;r-n&#34; combination.

So if you put it into a typeface, then other characters also have to be given extra negative space, so it doesn&#39;t stand out too much.

		<div class="commentbody">Svenni, I&#39;d also humbly suggest you consider legibilty through the entire process. The legibilty of the font has to be balanced with other things like the quality of the paper and dot gain &#40;if we&#39;re talking about printed instructions&#41;. The most legible font could be foiled by dropping the ball later in the process. I had some very smart safety instructions for a pleasurecraft that were laminated since it&#39;s likely you&#39;d need to refer to them while on the water. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I for one think you&#39;re on the right track. <BR> <BR>&#62; the way a type design can improve readability is aiding the eye navigation <BR>&#62; trough the text by facilitating the discrimination of the shapes &#40;bouma?&#41; of <BR>&#62; the key elements for its decypheration based on the syntax and morphology <BR>&#62; of the language. <BR> <BR>Yes, but at the type design level &#40;as opposed to writing custom software to dynamically optimize live text or something&#41;, you still have to address the individual letterforms. What you can do is map the entire lexicon of Spanish and find the sequences of letters that tend to get confused most, and diverge their constituent letters in key ways. This is not an easy task. For one thing, it requires grammatical sensitivity to work really well. <BR> <BR>BTW, don&#39;t focus on Javal&#39;s specifics too much: he was a stellar pioneer, but for that reason it was too early for him to be very exact about the details of readability. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, one can&#39;t doubt that Clearview works very well for the intended purpose: highway signage. But to me &#34;readability&#34; refers most to long passages of text &#40;like a book&#41;, and just the fact that Clearview is a sans would make it not extremely readable, even though I think it&#39;s a highly <i>legible</i>, handsome design. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;  why is most highway signage sanserif <BR> <BR>Part of it is cultural, but there&#39;s also the difference between legibility and readability, in terms of the reader having time to decipher a short word in the fovea &#40;by compiling the letters, which have to be highly decipherable in adverse conditions of weather and lighting&#41; versus immersive reading. Sans forms are more decipherable during deliberation. And note for example that highway signage is loosely spaced, while that&#39;s anathema in a book. <BR> <BR>BTW, one practical consideration for setting text on a fire extinguisher is that it&#39;s on a narrow cylinder, so you want a narrow font &#40;unless you set the text along the length, which might however momentality confuse people&#41;, since you don&#39;t please having to twist the thing back-and-forth to read lines. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

As for symbols, English is a second language for most people in Manhattan. I can&#39;t travel a block and not hear someone talking in something I don&#39;t know. Its just as important for non-english speaking people to understand how to operate the extingusher. If you didn&#39;t use graphics you&#39;d have to have the instructions in at least 5 languages.

Adding the colour simply increases the information available to those who are not colour blind. Those who are colour blind still have the same amount of information that they have with typical fire extinguishers.

		<div class="commentbody">The one time I used a fire-extinguisher for-real, I didn&#39;t stop to read the instructions ... I did, however, check to make sure the damn thing was rated for electrical fires. &#40;That could have made a Bad Day worse.&#41; <BR> <BR>Back to Svenni&#39;s original query: most extinguishers already have instructions printed on them, and most places that sell extinguishers will sell instructional placards to mount near them. Trying to design your own signs will get you into a <i>huge</i> project of trying to figure out federal, state &amp; local regulations, and to get approval from same.  Plus, if you live in the US and somebody gets hurt using the fire extinguisher, you could open yourself to litigation. &#40;&#34;The instructions did not clearly indicate you shouldn&#39;t point the nozzle at your face when pulling the trigger.&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>Re: r&#43;n = m, c&#43;l = d. Has anyone tried to make a ... er... &#34;non-touching ligature&#34; for these problems? I.e., rather than trying to design an r that works in all situations, design an alternate big-eared r that goes in an rn ligature. Just a thought. <BR> <BR>Jay</div>

If it is narrow, you&#39;ll get more words in one area, but then at the edges, it will be really rough to read, and you&#39;ll turn it. But you&#39;re probably right; there&#39;d be less turning if there were more words rather than being able to read the edges only a little better. <BR>[?] <BR>And actually, this sort of happened to me &#40;not the turning, but needing to read directions <i>really</i> carefully in a critical situation.&#41;  <BR>The pilot light on my heater went out in the middle of the night. The heater is in a closet so the lighting is bad, and since it was night, I was already tired, plus with the heater out, I was cold too. I&#39;ve always heard stories of people lighting the pilot and having their house blow up, so I was also a little nervous.  <BR> <BR>So I open the closet door, and here&#39;s what confronts me: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/21057.jpg" alt="water heater"> <BR> <BR>And of course, my favorite part: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/21058.jpg" alt="closeup"> <BR> <BR>I even smelled gas at one point. So I went back to bed after turning off the gas completely and called the landlord the next day. Hehe. <BR> <BR>In a lot of directional material, I notice all-caps. Nothing slows me down more.

		<div class="commentbody">I had trouble with the flashread, because it shows all words, whether short or long, for the same period of time. <BR> <BR>A more sophisticated version would also have interactivity for the reader to vary the rate of play. The reader could modulate playback speed with a slider or wheel -- which would allow going back to check something that was missed. <BR> <BR>Re your point, Hrant, perhaps something that was a hybrid of this and a &#34;moving window&#34; that shows parafoveal information, would be more efficient. <BR> <BR>Actually, dissolving between frames, rather than jump cutting, would be comparable to providing parafoveal info, and certainly easier on the eye.</div>
