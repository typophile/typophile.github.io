  just want a printer that will print solid beautiful color and crisp clean text.\r\nPhotos

  Postscript but Adobe Postscript has been around forever, hasn't that technology

    interpreters will only get you so far and watching your printer spit out a hundred
    blank pages when it hits some bit of code it can''t comprehend is truly aggravating
    (especially on a deadline). '

  body: "Right now you can get an amazing deal at costco.com on the Xerox Phaser 6130/N.
    We have a higher-end Xerox at work, and I really like it -- the color is vibrant,
    though I have seen some color-shifting. The smaller printer may not have the same
    issue, and even if it does, it may be able to be fixed with calibration, but I'm
    not sure. At $280 for a color laser with true PostScript 3, that price can't be
    beat. I ordered one the other day, and it should be at my door today. (It would
    have delivered yesterday had I been home.) I can report further after I set it
    up at home.\r\n\r\nOne cost caveat: the printer takes four toner cartridges that
    cost $70-80 each. On the plus side, they're probably good for about 5,000 prints,
    and you can make it so the printer only prints black when you want it to.\r\n\r\n<a

    no. The printer ships with carts rated at 1000 pages, and the standard ones are
    1900 for colour and 2500 for black.\r\n\r\nIt's not easy to find this info! See

    to PDF printing. Also, the 2550 series I have through my employer is the loudest
    damn printer I've ever heard.

  body: "Update: the printer arrived today. Setup was relatively easy, and print quality
    seems pretty good. Not the most vibrant thing ever, but color seems accurate enough.\r\n\r\nOne
    truly stupid thing: the manual feed doesn't have a tray like my LaserWriter 16/600
    does -- it's just a slot. I don't care that much that it only does one page at
    a time (the LaserWriter ended up being only able to do that too, though it didn't
    start out that way), but I'd like to be able to lay the page in the feeder and
    walk away.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit loud when it's printing, but otherwise it's very
    quiet."

  body: "I'm looking for a good basic BW letter size laser printer with true Postscript
    also, and can't seem to get straight answer anywhere.  They all seem to say postscript
    emulsion, which I don't believe is true.  I have an old HP 6MP that's been a workhorse,
    but is show as molasiss, and strung together with all kinds of adapters so it
    can connect to my network.  I also have a huge color Minolta Magaicolor that prints
    nice tabloid sheets, but chokes on almost everything I send to it because it isn't
    true Postscript (despite what they told be when I bought it).\r\n\r\nAnybody know
    of one for under $500? Like I said, just nee letter size and black only, but it
    must be true Postscript.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: James I highly recommend that machine. I have it. It pumps out pages fast
    - I've printed a 200 page book in 10 mins. The paper tray can be a little awkward
    if you switch paper size a lot. I don't have the duplex tray. I tend to leave
    11 x 17 paper in there and cut it down to size if I need smaller.

  body: "cthyaka,\r\n\r\nI loved HP products and use to own an HP Color Laser 11x17
    printer with duplex -- the dots weren't that sharp, but the machine really doe
    have artificial intelligence and if the paper is not in the tray - it knows to
    go to the next tray, which may not be the size - but that was alright with me.
    To replace all the toner at one shot -- I found a place on the internet in Brooklyn
    and it would be under $700 - and it was good for 20,000 to 30,000 reproductions.
    A new drum (only one) was a few hundred each year.\r\n\r\nToday I own an Okidata
    C9500 - also 11x17 color laser. It prints extremely sharp (even my professional
    printer has been overwhelmed by the printers I post - it is as good as the work
    they do.) It really does an excellent job - but it is not as smart as an HP. For
    example, should I have 5 sheets of cover stock in it, and I want to print 10 --
    it will print the first 5 and then start to print 6 and get rattled that it doesn't
    have the same paper weight. I have to shut it down and restart. The quality is
    great and I do get about 30,000 sheets before changing toner. However, every color
    not only has a toner - but a separate drum for each color... and the belt needs
    replacement every 12-18 mos. -- let's just say it is expensive to keep it going,
    and my customers like the idea of the local stationery store charging 49 cents
    a color copy. So I've advised the customers that remind me about this - they are
    welcome to use the other guy. \r\n\r\nI also have a small HP color printer now
    (I thought I'd save money on toner... not true) it gives me pretty pictures -
    it doesn't have to worry about drums - but the toners cost under $600 - and it
    doesn't last very long as it loves to print in a default of 2400 dpi, which of
    course uses up all the toner. I've asked how to change the default, and you can't
    -- you can with every job you are printing request in the software to lower it
    to 300 or 600 dpi - but the darn printer keeps printing in 2400 dpi. Also, I spent
    an additional 300 to put it on wireless - only to find out that it was a separate
    wireless system from the network's wireless... it is now hardwired into the network
    - saved a lot of headaches. \r\n\r\nIf you have any other questions - feel free...
    hope my first hand experiences are helpful to you. Even though you already have
    bought one as I just finished reading... lol"
