  body: "Probably lettering.\r\nClosest digital font I can find is David Nalle's Rousseau
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/RousseauAsCantina_5816.gif]  https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/rousseau/\r\nRousseau
    is based on a 19th century font by Schriftgiesserei Flinsch called Flinsch Kloster-Gotisch.
    The name \"Rousseau\" appears as part of the specimen published by Ludwig Petzendorfer
    in his Art Nouveau book. This explains the name used by David Nalle for the font.\r\nDon"
