    Although I agree with what you're saying, I believe it's irrelevant and absurd
    to assume that is why I am looking for one. Especially a lead pointer of all things.

    body: "re: So, why is a lead holder better than say a .5mm mechanical pencil,\u2026\r\n\r\nIt's
      one of those things that has to be experienced. One advantage is the ability
      to swap out leads of different hardness without fumbling around with fragile,
      hairlike leads or populating your draw full of bulky wood. They have a very
      different feel of weight than either wood or thin-lead mechanical pencils. There
      is also the nostalgia appeal. Just a few reasons off the top of my head."

    Preference or maybe it's due to being left-handed? Not sure but I don't really
    like the grip on an ordinary wooden pencil or the rubber grip on others.  The
    weight of the lead holder and the metal grip is more comfortable, in my opinion.
    As said above, it's also great to change out multiple lead sizes as well. \r\n\r\n@Karl
    Stange Hmm. I doubt it. Those are made for ordinary pencils which shaves the wood
    as it sharpens the lead so I'm not positive if it would damage the lead holder
    as well or if it would even fit.\r\n\r\nrussellm Thanks. I did come across that
    but if you look at the date, it's been almost a year from that post. I wouldn't
    be surprised if they didn't end up having it. Even if they did, that model is
    quite old. It was made in the 1970's thru the 1990's so I'm looking for a modern

    far as type design goes, I don't know why you would ever want to use a thicker

    for the shading, but in the 100% either white or black world of type design, I
    see no real advantage to it."
