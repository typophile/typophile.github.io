  <BR> <BR>Anyone know what typeface this is?  Also, are there any other typefaces
  that are similar?  Perticularly, I like how the &#34;d&#34; doesn&#39;t have a foot
  and is just rounded. '

    target="_blank">Proletarian</a> has the same footless style. <BR> <BR>And I think

  body: Dang! This looks a whole lot like a logo that I developped  <BR>for the Programmatorische
    Overheidsdienst Maatschappelijke  <BR>Integratie &#40;POD&#41;, a government service
    for social inclusion.  <BR>It didn&#39;t get used tho because the name changed.
    I&#39;ll try to post  <BR>it soon. <BR> <BR>BTW I think this is customized Helvetica
    or Univers &#40;I used  <BR>the same trick for my logo&#41;. I can&#39;t check
    it right now.
