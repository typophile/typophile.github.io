body: "Hello Everyone, \r\nI am working on a Latin type face design to be used in
  Non Latin text to write a word ,Paragraph and Phrases , In writing systems such
  as Hebrew, Armenian, Ethiopic and Farsi etc\u2026 .\r\nI am trying to make the X
  height as big as possible and open the bowls as much as I can . (It will be used
  on low resolution devices).\r\nI also want one Glyph to invite the reader to the
  next Glyph by Imaginary line (Please see 2nd Image)for faster and pleasant reading.
  (Hard to do but will try my best). \r\nMost of all I am trying to find the beauty,
  Proportion and balance of each individual Glyph ignoring the overall style where
  is needed.   \r\nMy question is : 1.Is it acceptable to have different forms with
  one individual Latin font style  ? \r\nFor example on the second Image P and b has
  different tips .\r\n2. I know the form of a,e,g are deciding factors on the rest
  form of Latin characters. What do you think about my a,e,g ?\r\nI am particularly
  interested to hear about my g (Which I like most among Latin characters). \r\nAll
  suggestions are very much appreciated.\r\nThanks ,\r\nAleme \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sketch_1_3724.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Explanation_!_5468.png]"

    little numbers are based on a Cyrillic design\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/beagle-boyz-nf/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/rimshot-nf/\r\n\r\nIf
    you can nail the original designer\u2019s groove, you can develop a workmanlike
    font. Your /g/ is appealing in its quirkiness, but not nearly as much fun as the
    one in Beagle Boyz NF\u2014IMHO/\r\n"

  body: "1. Variation like this is considered mild and often preferred for distinguishing
    glyphs that would otherwise be turned/flipped copies of each other. These letters
    have different histories manifesting in different expectations (for instance,
    the descender of |p| is more consistently expected to be straight) and it can
    be good to highlight these differences.\r\n\r\n2. |a| is excellent.\r\n|g| is
    nicely original but may appear to have an excess of loose ends; I suggest making
    the third from the top into a curve or corner.\r\nThe sharp beak of |e| is awkward,
    but might be saved with more adjustments of weight and proportion. Unfortunately
    a wavy crossbar such as this is seldom successful. The anthropomorphized smile
    of an |e| can contribute a lot to a typeface's \"voice\" and this shape creates
    a sort of sneer."

  body: Applying other forms familiar to non-Latin type may help to inform this as
    well, for example, working with a vertical grid and thinking about type mirrored
    or from the perspective of right-to-left text, as you would when constructing
    Arabic or Hebrew letterforms.

  body: "These glyphs need a lot of work.  The crossbar of the e looks childish to
    me.  Interestingly your sketches look better than your vectors, it doesn't seem
    like you copied them that closely.  For example, the top left corner of your g
    in your sketches seems to go almost as far to the left as the line that connects
    the bowls, and has a decent look to it, whereas in your vector, the line connecting
    the bowls seems to go way out in the middle of nowhere.  Also, your sketched a
    has a nice sense of proportion between the bowl and the rest of the letter, but
    your vector a's bowl is much too big.  I would try to get close to your original
    sketches, try to introduce just a little more thick/thin contrast, and round off
    the corners just a bit.\r\n\r\nNot trying to be mean, just telling you how I see
    it."

  body: "Thank you so much it is really eye opening suggestions.  \r\n@cerulean ,
    I see exactly  the excess of loose ends of g will work on it  .\r\n@Harnt, Very
    interesting link . Nice discussion too. Just below GARDEN IMAGE it says making
    the letters stand alone, referring only to themselves. Mine is the opposite please
    see the Image below .\r\nIn my design I want to make the letters confident and
    yet selfless .Have you seen a bull fighter movement how the fighter  bows and
    move his hand smoothly and doge the bull . I want to create same feel in each
    letter.\r\nI am not exactly trying to apply non_Latin forms in Latin type face.
    I am experimenting to see when  non Latin type face design/method and thinking
    applies to Latin letters .  BTW this is my first Latin type face I always design
    Ethiopian type face . Thanks again   [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Skwtch_2_6196.png]"

    . I think the imaginary line(not connecting ) works better  "

    are directed inwards (or at nothing), making the letters stand alone, referring
    only to themselves'. My aim was to draw shapes together, in contrast to Helvetica.
