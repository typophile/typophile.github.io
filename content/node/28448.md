  logo and need some suggestions for a font similar to their logotype. If it helps,
  the words I'm going to be setting are \"Culby 10\" instead of \"Secret.\" Any thoughts?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bdy_1_5104.jpg]"

    of Stephen Coles</a>. especially the one with the "Pillowy Soft Scripts", but
    also the packing posts and more. '

    of <a href="http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts2.htm" target="_blank">Sudtipos'</a>
    fonts might work well.

  body: "Since there are no letters in common between Culby 10 and Secret, the lettering
    will be less important than the background in most people's minds. Stephen's list
    would be a good place for ideas, or you could browse the script samples in <a
    href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script08Pg1.html\">Part 8 of the Script Font
    ID Guide</a> (Casual non-flowing scripts) for similar looks.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
