body: "Hello Everyone,\r\nI have been a member of Typophile for a long time now and
  wanted to promoted my typographic artwork on this forum. Please let me know what
  you think of it and it's concept.\r\n\r\nI design the visible relationship between
  typeface, landscape and culture (architecture, philosophy, art movements, politics).\r\n\r\nTypography
  is to visual language as maps are to topography.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ferrybuilding_Fnt_5578.jpg]\r\nI
  am a pioneer in the land of topographic typography ( Check my work out https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/omarsandoval/topographic-typographyworld-geography-thru-visual
  ). I seek to shed light on typeface design, to generate insight, and to delight
  by setting my favorite cities in a face whose historical echoes and associations
  that harmonize with the forms they belong to. I paint by numbers, letter forms,
  and a palette of analphabetic symbols that have the same character, spirit and personality
  of each location.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopography: originated in ancient Greece as the description
  of a place (topos, \"place\" and graphia,\"writing\"). This meaning is less common
  in America where it is synonymous with relief and elevation contour drawings. (Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nTypography:
  also originated in Greece (typos, \"form\" and graphia, \"writing\").\r\n\r\nHistorical
  Interlude.\r\n\r\nTypographic history mirrors topography such that it is the study
  of the  relationships of human culture: politics, philosophy (structuralism, post-structuralism),
  architecture, and art movements (Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical, Romanticism,
  Realism, Geometric Modernism, Lyrical Modernism and Post Modernism).\r\n\r\nI believe
  Typography is architecture on a page; typefaces are buildings, leading floors, columns
  walls, tracking rooms, kerning furniture, letter forms bricks and the grid mortar."
