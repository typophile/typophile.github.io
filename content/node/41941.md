body: "Well, it's been about 5 years since I've graduated college... I've been working
  for a company for 3 of those years. It's a nice company, government contractor in
  the private sector... I'm the sole creative energy in the entire office. Despite
  all this, there aren't a lot of creative opportunities, nor is there much in the
  way of position excel. A few other factors have come into play that have caused
  me to rethink my continued career path with this company. So, now I'm starting to
  think about what I need to do to move on and I'm hoping the creative brain trust
  of Typophile can lighten the dark road to a new job.\r\n\r\nAs of now, most of my
  work is either in some digital format or collecting dust in a few boxes. My only
  portfolio consists of design work from college only, and I haven't updated since
  getting this job. I've been trying to keep my resume information updated, but it's
  not really designed. I have a web address, but no content (my web skills are rather
  limited, and I'm afraid this will hinder my search.)\r\n\r\nI'm considering a move
  as well. I'm currently in the heart of Pennsylvania, and after 3+ years I'm exhausted
  with it's resources. I have friends and family in Philadelphia, so as of now I'm
  really consider that as my major focal point when looking.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping you
  guys can help me get organized and focus my attention on the important parts of
  what I'll need to begin my search and ultimately end it with a new job! "

  body: "I'd focus first and foremost on the web site, resume, and business card.
    You need to be able to direct someone quickly to samples of your work, and all
    three of those are vital. Your physical portfolio - yes, you need to update that
    to show professional work. A lot of A.D.s (myself included when I was one) are
    not that interested in student work and will want to see what you've done since
    then. You should also create a digital portfolio, in pdf form, that you can send
    around, especially if the web site will take some time to get up and running.\r\n\r\nIn
    the meantime, until you've made the move, try to take on some freelance projects
    to keep your portfolio fresh and varied."
