  from the early 90's.  I have attached two pieces of the text.  My label is badly
  faded and I want to make a new label with the authentic font.

  body: Thank you so much - you know your fonts!!!  I ended up using News Gothic Demi
    for the "CAUTION" and News Gothic for the rest of the text.  Almost a perfect
    match.
