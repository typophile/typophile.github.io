  body: An excellent non-online source (like, books) is the works of John M. Bergling,
    specifically <em>Heraldic Designs for Artists and Craftspeople, Heraldic Designs
    And Engravings Manual, Art Alphabets And Lettering, Art Monograms And Lettering</em>
    and </em>Ornamental Designs And Illustrations</em>. The first is available in
    reprint (check amazon.com) and can be had cheaply; the others are occasionally
    available in the original, and fetch a reasonable price for the quality of the
    content.
