  Futura Extra Bold Oblique.\r\nCli\xEBnt wants to keep that but I'm uncertain about
  the traps when using the logo larger.\r\nShould I manually alter it so there are
  no traps or should I leave it as is.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n"

    you still some modulation, so be careful not to be too geometric. Traps aren't
    just for ink!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    how stuff is perceived and geometrically correct."
