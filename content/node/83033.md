  closed</a> for a project but if we do then ideally we'll need a heavier weight.
  Anyone know of any similar fonts that go heavier?\r\n\r\nThanks..."

  body: 'Hi, no we hadn''t looked at those, in fact we looked at those for our previous
    project which had a military theme so it didn''t seem like the right place to
    look for our current theme which is futuristic. But there are some good alternatives
    in there so that was a great post, thanks for helping out.  '
