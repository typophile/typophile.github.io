body: "I'm trying to replace missing and damaged pages from some rare issues of 'The
  BOYS' FRIEND LIBRARY' by creating good facsimile pages. This is a lot more difficult
  than I thought it would be because I'm having a lot of problems exactly matching
  the original types to any modern equivalents. These magazines were published by
  the Amalgamated Press Ltd. \r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThere
  are several types that I need to identify so I've included scans of each.\r\nThese
  are:\r\n- Cover Types, which includes a handwritten type face that seems to be used
  for all issues I have (more than 50) so I'm guessing (or hoping) it's likely to
  be known.\r\n- Header, body and chapter title types.\r\n- Spine text type\r\n- Author
  name type\r\n\r\nRather a few I'm afraid but I'm sure there will be others as I
  go through the damaged issues.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for any help any of you can provide."
