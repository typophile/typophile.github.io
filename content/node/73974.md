  new version of Unicode will provide new blocks for symbol and pictographic characters.
  A new era of beyond-lettering-fontography is to dawn. \r\n.\r\nThis new font will
  feature a large amount of new UC-6.0 codepoints for symbols. It is the \uFB01rst
  font to support letters and pictograms alike based on a large-scale standardized
  encoding scheme. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Apvorschau11a_6682.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Apvorschau11b_5497.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Apvorschau11c_6173.png]"

  body: "I'm somewhat suprised to see charts from Unicode 6.0 beta. Lots of new glyphs,
    especially emoticons and common signs. But it still lacks important accented characters
    used in marginal languages \u2013as Yoruba and Tupi\u2013 and also symbols for
    Cartography, Chemistry, Ecomony, Medicine, Work Safety and Ergonomy. All these
    are far more important than some emoticons proposed.\r\n\r\nI understand Unicode
    is based on proposals. So the problem is not with the Unicode Comitee but with
    the organizations which handle these matters and must ask for additions.\r\n\r\n<strong>Andreas</strong>:
    the signs you are previewing here are wonderful. Hope to see more very soon."

    for Cartography, Chemistry, Ecomony, Medicine, Work Safety and Ergonomy</cite>\r\n\r\nIn
    principle, you\u2019re right. The question is, how to deal with it. Unicode/ISO
    offer a fair procedure to get along with such things. But the point is: who is
    going to do the work? Who is willing to fund the labour neccessary to write a
    proposal for 500 characters? \r\nAsk M. Everson about his efforts to get Egyptian
    Hieroglyphs encoded. Ask a cartographer about the willingness of his colleagues
    to undertake encoding work of their own subject. \u2013 You will get very disapointed.\r\nHowever
    sensible an ALIEN MONSTER (1F47E) as a character may be in *our eyes*, someone
    proposed it and made a case for its usage. Therefore it gets in. \r\n\r\nI hope
    being able to explain a bit more about the pending additions in the near future.\r\n

  body: 'Thanks, Andreas. As I said, the problem relates with organizations (or researchers)
    whose handle these matters. It''s a pitty the interest about Unicode, one of the
    most important standards, is not so wide as it must be. As an example, there is
    the little issue I told in another thread: Brazilian currency sign was dropped
    in 1967, but Unicode states it as current. I''m pretty sure nobody in Brazil ever
    contacted Unicode consortium to correct this.'

  body: "I do remember reading about how Burmese, being encoded by means of Unicode
    purism, is therefore very difficult to implement.\r\n\r\nAccented letters for
    French, German, and Italian are in Unicode even though they could be handled by
    precomposed sequences - and what about Korean? Instead, Unicode should be handling
    all languages equally - it should be as simple and convenient to process Tupi,
    Yoruba, and Burmese by computer as French or Korean.\r\n\r\nAnd assumptions about
    the technology in use shouldn't be made either - first code glyphs, then characters
    (i.e., for Arabic) - so that one can always print a desired set of glyphs, even
    if they don't follow the usual rules of the language. (Tables of initial, medial,
    and final forms, anyone?)"

  body: "I think there's no doubt that if anyone on this list were to redesign Unicode
    from scratch, he'd make a better standard than the official one.  That's not the
    point, though -- the value of Unicode is that it's a standard that everyone in
    the world uses, whatever their country or their OS.  (And don't get me started
    about TRON.)\r\n\r\nThere are good political reasons why Unicode turned out the
    way it has.  Originally, it was meant to be just the way you envision -- 16 bit
    wide, no precomposed characters, CJK entirely unfied.  In order to make Unicode
    compatible with the ISO 10646 charter, a few principles needed to be sacrified:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>
    large numbers of precomposed characters (\"accented letters\"), for compatibility
    with legacy encodings;\r\n<li> de-unification of parts of CJK, S-commaaccent,
    etc.\r\n<li> presentation forms (Arabic, fi and fl, etc.).\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSo
    could you design a better universal coding?  You bet.  But could you get all of
    the world to accept it without sacrificing at least some of your principles?\r\n\r\n--jch\r\n"

  body: AFAIK, most "scarification" of Unicode principals was for political rather
    technical reasons, the whole idea of round-trip conversion (which is nonsense,
    if you ask me) was a pure political decision to convince national standardisation
    bodies that they can convert through and forth between Unicode and there existing
    national standards. Now that Unicode is past this stage and whoever does not play
    by Unicode rules is left behind, they can now (not exactly now, this have been
    going for a while now) force the original principals.
