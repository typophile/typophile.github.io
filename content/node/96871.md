    as it looks very generic and neutral to me. \r\nCan't be 100% positive so here
    are some possibilities: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/corporate-s/|Corporate
    S]] (possibly matching, filling all design specifications, the closest I have
    at least), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/air/|Air Condensed]] (/S looks
    slightly off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/|Trade Gothic
    Condensed]] ([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/pro-condensed-18//|#18]]
    is probably the closest you could get, /S has horizontal stroke ends), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/benton-sans/|Benton
    Sans]] (really like this one and even if the overall design looks off)"
