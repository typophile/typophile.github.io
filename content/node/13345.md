  to pair with mrs eaves. subhead and logo mrs eaves,\r\nneed a sans for the copy
  text.\r\n\r\n2nd copperplate (light and medium): looking for a sans to pair copperplate
  with.\r\na sans that somehow \"reduces\" that elegant copperplate feeling (subhead
  and logo are\r\nset in copperplate, looking for a sans to set copy text and all
  other texts).\r\n\r\nthanks: lars"

    to pairing suggestions. if it's not up, i'll try to find the thread again... it
    look like the [[typowiki]] is up, but i'll post the link to the old thread anyway:

    i should be  a salesperson for Storm Type Foundry, i'm always recommending their
    stuff in this design section.\r\n\r\nFor copperplate, have a look at <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/engravers-gothic/\">Engraver's
    Gothic</a>"

  body: 'Lars, do you really need to use a sans for copy? Generally, in my opinion
    they are less readable. Goudy Old Style might be a good serif pairing for Copperplate,
    as Goudy also did it, and Goudy Old Style is fairly wide. Of course this would
    get an ''old fashioned'' look, which may be good or bad, depending on the purpose
    of your piece.  '

    pdfs available for download.\r\n\r\nFor Copperplate on the other hand, I see no
    connection with a Sans Serif. I think you should reconsider it and maybe try some
    serif typeface instead, but hey that's just my personal point of view ;-)"

  body: 'well, the "problem" is that it''s an existing logo for a restaurant. first
    they (the client) wanted to reach people around 40 and up, but now the also want
    to have younger people around 30 at the restaurant/bar and  i was asked to do
    some posters/flyers for them to address those "younger" people, too. so i''m looking
    for something to work with copperplate in the logo and that can be used for flyer/posters
    to address those 30somethings ... '

    and find a nice juicy script. but that's just me...\r\n\r\n<em>the search function
