  am looking for the font on the charts, not the one on the first 'general info' page.\r\n\r\nAnother

  body: "Basic structure similar to Rockwell http://www.identifont.com/find?font=rockwell&q=Go
    but there are significant differences in detail, not least of which is the big
    ball terminal on r -- an unusual feature in a slab serif.\r\nMight be a bespoke
    font for the map company.\r\nIn any case, perhaps another font detective recognizes
    this one.\r\ndon"

  body: "Examining the fonts in the map pix, Adobe Reader identifies Arial and several
    unknowns. The main unknown has a flat top 3 [banker's 3] and other differences
    from Arial. Some of the other font detectives are much better than I am in recognizing
    modern sans serif fonts, so here is the subset of the Bold for them to demonstrate
    their superior font matching skills\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UnknownSansAirChart_6732.jpg]\r\nAs
    in the case of the serif I previously posted, this might be bespoke for the company.\r\nDon"
