  will work well set negative. (hvite on black background) I am looking for a version
  that has thicker hairlines basically. The client i am buying it for have a lot of
  old readers / brochures are read under bad lighting conditions / a lot of different
  designers are handling the typeface etc., so it needs to be.. well, easy to handle.
  \r\n\r\nAnyone know any good alternatives? Or revivals, or fonts that are based
  on Baskerville? I am using it with Futura so it needs to work well with that font
  too.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Well we bought a classic and high contrast version called Baskerville Handtooled.
    Looked great in titles but not so great in running text.. The Futura is only used
    in large titles and I'm not sure of the version.. But i guess as long as the Baskerville
    is close to the \"theoretical\"  Futura I guess it is good\r\n\r\n"
