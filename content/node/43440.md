  body: "> this thread is about \u201Cbuilding\u201D type, not books\r\n\r\nIf the
    thread is about graphic books, then it qualifies for this site. (The poster is
    actually talking about a graphic design portfolio, and that is eminently within
    the mandate of this site and this section).\r\n\r\nTo the original question, my
    brain works poorly in metric, but what you want to do is to build a book that
    is large enough to show your largest sample, and to provide appealing whitespace
    around other items. Your paper should feel lush and solid, not flimsy, and a cover
    should be strong enough to hold it all together so it doesn't get damaged if you
    have to leave it with a potential client/employer."

  body: I thinks that you should do this by a dialogue with a printer or two, there
    are economical sizes for books. Once you find some suitable sizes, select one
    that suits your purpose. Needless to say, the printer selected should also be
    good in quality and price, huh;-)
