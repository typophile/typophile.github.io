  body: "\"Downtown Marquette\": the first or the last type treatment. Size, the first
    one. Maybe even a little more curved, if it doesn't look awkward. Maybe I would
    try a loopless q, I tend to read \"Marguette\".\r\n\r\nThe \"two typefaces\" rule:
    it doesn't apply here. I think you graciously succeed in giving the right retro
    feel.\r\n\r\nThe rooster: it adds a subtle yet charming asymmetry that liven up
    the composition."

  body: "I quite like what you have going there - some ideas:\r\n\r\n\u2022 not sure
    about the 'The' at the top. Even though I like Bello very much, it seems overpowering
    and drawing too much attention to itself.\r\n\u2022 you might consider increasing
    the stroke width of the shadow on 'MARKET' as there is a danger of it disappearing
    at smaller sizes.\r\n\u2022 maybe decrease the size of the stars?\r\n\u2022 slightly
    more space between 'FARMERS..' and 'MARKET'?\r\n\u2022 like Picard said, maybe
    remove the '2010' and use the space for 'EST. 1931'\r\n\r\nLooking forward to
    how this turns out.\r\n\r\nSeb"

    \"two typefaces\" rule: it doesn't apply here. I think you graciously succeed
    in giving the right retro feel.</cite>\r\n\r\nFor me that is the most difficult
    thing in those projects.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the rooster and the \"The\". It
    takes a bit of the asymmetry of the ampersand back. Without it, the asymmetry
    would drag attention in a negative way. That\u2019s good. If Bello drags to much
    attention, may be dependent from the size in this case. And in the example with
    the background pattern, I think Bello drags less attention."

  body: '"Est. 1931" looks discentered (to the right) in the first example from your
    last post, although it probably is centered and the reason for that impression
    is the space above the letter e. I would take the first example, but put "Est.
    1931" to the bottom as in the second example. And somehow it does not look like
    a logo anymore. I liked it (a bit) more in the circle with the background-texture.
    But probably it is dependent from the purpose.'

    I didn't really think about the possibility of the logo being sized down for other

    stamp like Herbert Leupin! I just found out today that the market does not want
    stationery any longer, so I'm not sure how small this logo will get. \r\n\r\nI
    will have a primary logo, secondary and a seal/tertiary - I will start printing
    them to see how they look at smaller sizes. \r\nThanks for pointing that out Tell.

    budgets barely have enough allocated to promote 1 logo, let alone 3. Work on a
    single strong logo, then look at a graphic system that supports it. \r\n\r\nYou
    could even think about implementing it with stamps \u2013 it would give it a hand
    crafted feel, link to trading seals, and would be able to turn any old piece of
