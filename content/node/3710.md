body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>does anyone know this font? I found it in a cafe. It&#39;s
  a logo from a coffeecompany, but I don&#39;t know if the logo is handmade or it
  is a real font. <BR>If it&#39;s handmade maybe I would make a font out of it. I
  like it. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28978.gif"

  body: It is similar to a number of fonts from the Art Deco  era, but I can&#39;t
    find an exact match. Leslie Cabarga has done a number of these connected &#39;machined&#39;
    scripts, but Nick Curtis&#39;s <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg5.html"
    target="_blank">&#34;Lakeshore Drive&#34;</a> is the closest I know to this style.
    You can see the others I&#39;ve collected, in that section of the Script Guide.
