body: "hey Typophiles-\r\n\r\nas my co-worker was just copying and pasting from Word
  to InDesign, she realized that the text (from Word) was full of ligatures. when
  she did a spell check (in Word), all of the words with the ligatures came up mispelled.
  then, the characters didn't paste into InDesign. they were replaced by fractions.\r\n\r\nis
  this an OpenType Issue?  is this a Preferences thing? or is our stuff just funky??
  sorry if this makes no sense...\r\n\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\n-------\r\nnc\r\n\r\nbtw\r\ni
  am new at this whole Typophile thing but i think this forum is awesome and it's
  amazing how much you all know about this stuff."

  body: i'm guessing this kind of behavior could be due to usage of private use unicode
    codepoints where the codepoints for the copied font don't match up with those
    of the pasted font. If this is the case I would think that changing the font to
    match that of the original document will solve this problem. But this is all conjecture
    on my part...

  body: "The original ligatures in the text were hardcoded, not automatically assembled
    by referencing their component letters. They might also have used expert set characters
    or a non-standard encoding (just speculating there).\r\n\r\nYou'll need to search
    and replace them with their component characters. It may be easiest to do this
    in Word before bringing the text over to ID.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "thank you Thomas.\r\n\r\ni guess that this leads to another general question
    about OpenType: how do the auto-ligatures work in common use (like in Word) for
    the non-typo-savvy? does it normally work with a standard spellcheck?\r\n\r\nis
    this a common issue, or is it rare, depending on the font?\r\n\r\n------\r\nnc"
