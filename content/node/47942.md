  Franklin Gothic, but the "J" points vertically.  That (among other things) rules
  out News Gothic and Trade Gothic. It''s not Helvetica or Univers or AG.  The tail
  on the "a" is straight.  I''m sure it''s a really common face and I''m just drawing
  a blank.  '

    the first line is in a different typeface?"

  body: I think whats throwing you is that there are 2 different typefaces here. The
    bottom part looks like Franklin Gothic to me although the quality of the scan
    makes it hard to be certain. The top part looks more like a Swiss Grotesk face,
    could be a cut of Helvetica or Akzidenz. The quality again makes it difficult
    to pin point. Thats is my theory anyway!

  body: "Sadly, this is the best scan I have - I think this was originally done in
    2003, then scanned, then printed, then scanned, then printed.  Pretty gross.  I
    think you're right, naoiseo - I can come \"close enough\" with Helvetica and FG.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    confirmed Helvetica Neue 85 Heavy and Franklin Gothic Book"
