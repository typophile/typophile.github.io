  \u201CDIETA INDUSTRIAL\u201D LE EST\xC1 EMPUJANDO HACIA LAS ENFERMEDADES?\r\n\r\nWhen
  I place the copy into inDesign, the \xBF's baseline drops(like above has it).  I
  correct whenever I encounter it for a cleaner look (has it appears in the translation),
  but I'm curious if there are other subtle tweaks that the English language doesn't
  have to worry about, but the Spanish do.  Treatment of accents and such.  Does anyone
  have typical things they correct when going through their Spanish copy?"

    f\xED.  In all caps raising the \xBF can be nice but isn't obligatory.  A quick
    look at advertisements in and around Madrid will show it's not the norm.\r\n\r\nThe
    m-dash comes along a bit more in Spanish and has spacing rules that can differ
    from English styles.  It spacing usage in Spanish is equivalent to a parenthesis.
    \ That is:\r\n\r\nFoo \u2014bar\u2014 foo.  But:\r\nFoo \u2014bar\u2014, foo.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's done in a handwriting font, (this may or may not apply in South America),
    the capital i will frequently maintain its dot.  And universally in the Spanish-speaking
    world, the tilde can transform into a macron both in handwriting and more geometric
    fonts."
