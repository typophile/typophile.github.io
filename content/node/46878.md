  \"a song from C18th Italy\" \r\nI would like to have the \"C\" go round the \"18th\"\r\nIs

    I see no reason why it couldn't be possible. Make the C bigger (set lighter style
    if available, for strokes' optical consistency), lower it's baseline; analogically,
    scale down the \"18th\" (heavier style) and raise it. Then set negative kerning
    between both, simple and quite obvious if you're working with InDesign or similar
    software. Here's a quick sample:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_5531.png]\r\n\r\nJust
    courious: what's the group name?"
