body: Not too terribly long ago I had to deal with some font naming issues. One of
  the most useful articles on this for me was Adam Twardoch's piece on the MSN Groups
  page. I went into the wiki to find this again and saw that it was closed. Is there,
  by chance, a copy of this anywhere online?

    I'm putting together a small FontLab tutorial for in-house use where I work and
    thought I would include some useful links."

  body: Ah, that's quite inconvenient, as I also used to look up that MSN Groups article
    every now and then. Maybe Adam has the text that was on it backed up somewhere?
    Or maybe he can even write it again (for the newer FLStudio version)? :)

    interested in dependencies than in a single solution which in my opinion does
    not exist.\r\nIs my observation (from your previous posts and work you showed)
    correct that you mostly do single- or two-style families? In this case you could
    easily set up a very simple naming how-to or chart by yourself, and you would
    not even need to mention the Preferred Family/Style name fields since these could
    be left empty.\r\n\r\nGood to see the FLS5 Font Family Naming document back online!
    I hope the others too will be available soon.\r\n(Adam, I notice the new terminology
    including \"Typo Family Name\" and wonder why you don't stick to FLS5's and AFDKO
    MakeOTF manual's \"Preferred Family Name\". This better expresses what you mean.)"

  body: "I completely agree that there is a need to emphasize that what's currently
    termed \"preferred\" names should be considered the \"normal\" ones (possibly
    by omitting any qualifier) while today's \"normal\" ones should be considered
    as \"special\" (serving for style-linking or \"grouping\" as you say). AFDKO does
    so since a long time. This is not a matter of words but of conception.\r\nThe
    only thing that I do not like is the term \"typographic\" -- everything we do
    is \"typographic\" somehow, so the term doesn't say anything, like \"black\" does
    not help to distinguish one kind of liquorice from another.\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: In my eyes, the term "typographic family" means "family in the typographic
    sense" i.e. tries to distinguish itself from "family in the technical sense".
    Anyhow, this will be explained in the FontLab Studio 6 manual :)
