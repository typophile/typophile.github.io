  time.\r\n\r\nI have done graphic design for ages. I have always had a special love
  for typedesign. By now i have reached the age og 30 where restlessness decrease,
  and the time to deepen into the the world of typographic perfectionism.\r\n\r\nThe
  last year i have done some designs and some half done font sets in Fontlab. As i
  haven't been drawing the last 10 years i have done my designs in Illustrator but
  it's not satisfying to see how creativity \"stock\" in the tool-palette.\r\n\r\nI
  want to start all over. Re-invent my drawing skills and learn to draw type the hard
  way. What books should i go after. I have already ordered \"Learn Fontlab Fast\"
  for the \"Production\" part, but i need a good book or two dealing with composition
  and design in the drawing phase.\r\n\r\nI really hope you guys (i am sure you can)
  can help me go rookie again :)\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nBenjamin"
