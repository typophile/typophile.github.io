<div class=commentbody>Me, I got to wait another week for when we traditionally give
our gifts (although most of us break down and give on both days).
The good thing though is this way shopping is cheaper/faster. :-)
And one tradition quite particular to our family (although I'm
sure others do it secretly too) is that of the self-gift: each person
gets to buy (and wrap and place under the tree) a gift of his own
choosing (usually something small though) so that he gets at
least one thing he likes for sure. Mine is this:

The jacket is sweet.

<div class=commentbody>Si,
I got the same Kern zip too! My best gift was from my daughter who gave me a T shirt she made with Leporello on it!
My wife spilled the beans early and she is getting me a digital camera for my birthday in a couple of weeks. Now I won't be the only person at TypeCon without one :-)

<div class=commentbody>Josh, I knew you'd like it. The thing is, you need to get a continental -and preferably Teutonic- friend to buy one and send it to you. Apparently some of the models are feared of possibly being considered underaged (consent-wise) in the US (which is -rightly- seen as overly puritanical) so they refuse to mail any over here, just in case. The true god of our age is Liability.

<div class=commentbody>Dan, many of the examples in the tschicold book are actual size, which is good.
But there are quite a few which are "reduced", and as they are sharp "line" rather than halftone images, I have been able to examine them with favorable results, magnifying glass in one hand, glass of scotch in the other.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>What is your favorite page in the Tschichold book?</em>
Along those lines, the one where he's crossed out an entire page proof he didn't like, with a big "X" and the comment "all wrong. Jan Tschichold."
However, on reading the book I've realized how influential Tschichold has been on my work. I recognized many of the pieces from Typographische Gestaltung. The reason is that my wife had a better education in typography as part of her art foundation course in Winnipeg, than I did in mine in the UK; and she possessed a copy of "Asymmetric Typography" (the English version of Typographische Gestaltung) which had just been published in Canada at that time. It was the first serious work on typography that I read.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like your photo Nick, it's really cool. If I were you, I'd use the magnifying glass to look at your bottle of scotch. Santa gave me a smokey peaty malt scotch whiskey that is excellent and hidden away from visitors and friends. Like Hrant, I celebrate a second Christmas in January and really like his self-gift tradition (which I don't have). I'm going to suggest it to my family.

<div class=commentbody>I have the self-gift tradition, too. I've got this nice bottle of 12-year-old Glenmorangie that I am just taking out right now. Mmmmm.
My only typographic gifts were "American Type Design & Designers" by David Consuegra (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581153201), and "The Solid Form of Language" by Robert Bringhurst (beautifully letterpress-printed, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1894031881/qid=1135743897).
Despite quite liking both of those, I think my favorite gift I received has to be the uber-deluxe edition of "Watchmen" that my wife gave me (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401207138 or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen). This has always been one of my all-time favorite works, and it's great to have the added material and a physical tome that does it justice. I still have my two softcover copies for loaners. (I think maybe I loaned one to John Berry, actually - need to check on that some time.)
Cheers,
T</div>

My girlfriend gave me a bunch of french king size letterpress wood types to play around with when I get grumpy.
In both <cite>the solid form of language</cite> and <cite>Typographia polyglotta</cite> they mention the Serbo-Croatian script situation, which I haven't been aware of before.
I think it'll make an excellent conversation piece on the New years eve party we're having. No?

<div class=commentbody>I usually get a bottle of Lagavulin from my in-laws, but this year they surprised me with a bottle of Poire William instead. I love just opening it and inhaling deeply: like having a pear shoved up your nostril. Wonderful.
I did get something scotch-related though: a set of four trendy Riedel stemless riesling glasses. Lately, I've been reading more and more whiskey experts recommending drinking fine scotch from white wine glasses rather than the kind of tumblers I've been using for years. All the arguments in favour of the wine glasses, how they concentrate the aroma, etc. make eminent sense, but I always felt effete with my dark smokey scotch in a delicately stem'd wine glass. But now I've found the perfect solution in these perfectly shaped wine glasses <em>without stems</em>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, I received the same Reidel stemless glasses for my birthday this year. Aren't they wonderful? I actually got the entire set of both white and red wine glasses. It's hard to get used to holding the actual glass and not the stem, isn't it? Admittedly, I picked up some proper scotch glasses straight from Scotland last year. I prefer the weight of a heavy glass in my hand and the peatier the scotch, the better!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Santa gifted me with an IOU for money toward a trip to England for my birthday, several gift certificates (as I'm not so easy to shop for), and a few other things that fit nicely into my stocking.
The highlight though was my mom pranking all of us with her sudden ability to play Silent Night on a flute. She started taking lessons on the DL in October and had us all convinced it was some sort of trick.
Oh and getting to see my new nephew. He's so tiny.
I bought the KERN jacket for my boyfriend in the fall. It seems as if there will be many of those all of the world now. I love it!</div>

This is the drawback of that style glass. But for everyday, most wine drinkers don't get all the details right. I do well to locate a relatively decent bottle of the basic varietals before they fade, and often warm the wine in the glass with the heat of my hand to bring it around. Clearly those stemless glasses are more of an issue with whites.</div>

The 'linguistic cleansing' that took place during the break-up of Yugoslavia is a sad but interesting adjunct to that script situation. The Croats were the most dedicated in this regard -- there was a proposal to abolish all words of Serbian origin, approx. 30% of the typical vocabulary if I recall correctly; an official insistence that Croatian and Serbian were totally different, mutually unintelligible languages; and renewed interest in a Nazi-era spelling reform that would have obscured the etymology of most words --, but my favourite bit of weirdness came from the Bosnian Serbs, who for a while during the war required school children to write even their English language homework in the Cyrillic script.</div>

And some students of mine (somehow) gave me a copy of Book One of Euclid, designed by Bruce Rogers. Yowza.
Non-typographically, I also got <em>The Dialogues of Plato</em> (set in Palatino -- brrr), and Rilke's <em>Letters to a Young Poet</em> (set in Novarese -- ech).</div>

<div class=commentbody>I got a dutch chocolate letter "P", and a basket of what has come affectionately to be called 'dad's stinky food': various odd cheeses, herring filets, black lumpfish, kippers, antipastos and the like with a tasty port.
Tonight it's a hogmanay event with haggis and no doubt a Scotch or two at the Gibson House. Saturday night it will be Dutch Genever or Bols Advocaat. The genever is a tribute to Henk Krijger (Raffia Initials) the Advocaat to my mother, a kindly Calvinist woman who indulged only it, and only during the Christmas season.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/]</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>I find this very interesting. I’d be interested if anyone’s written more extensive on the matter.</em>
I read a very good article on the subject in the late 1990s, but have not been able to find it again.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Lagavulin... mmmmm.
I ended up ordering the Veer Kern zipup for a fellow type-geek.
But my best gift was to myself: brand new G5 2 gig iMac with 20" LCD screen! It is so beautiful and 5x as fast as the old G4 tower it just replaced. Best part was getting rid of the honking 20" old school monitor that has been parked on my desk for five years now. I'm smokin' baby, smokin'!</div>

<div class=commentbody>My lovely girlfriend gave me Jan Tschichold's <em>Erfreuliche Drucksachen durch gute Typographie</em> for Christmas (well, Advent, really) this year. My birthday was also recently, and I got a bunch of typographic presents then, including:
<em>Typolemik/Typophil</em> by Hans-Peter Willberg
<em>Thinking with Type</em> by Ellen Lupton
<em>Chronik der D. Stempel AG 1895–1955</em> by the [[D. Stempel AG]] (and set in [[Gudrun Zapf von Hesse]]'s lovely [[Diotima]])
Lastly, I also tend to give myself presents for Christmas. This year was <em>Indie Fonts 1 and 2</em> and P22's 10-year anniversary book!</div>
