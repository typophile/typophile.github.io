body: "Its for a company called Mixed Economy Group (MEG) who helps universities get
  funding from the government to support colleges with both FE (further ed) and HE
  (higher education). So they are the core of it all if you know what i mean. these
  colleges would not get funded and would not run without them.\r\nI want to give
  it a sense of belonging. I tried representing different coloured circles to represent
  different colleges but evolving round MEG because MEG is the foundation of it all.
  They are the core for those colleges/universities. how can i make it better? what
  typeface would be better suited for this. any ideas well come! thanks.\r\nPS This
  is only the beginning of my logo. i am still in the process of making it work.i
  will keep updating it every now and then.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo1_6588.png]"

    body: what if i had one colour but different opacity for each ring then it can
      work in black and white but then it wont represent the colleges on their own
      as an individual institution but i can turn the meaning around and say they
      are all under MEG and they on in thier catogory because there is another company
      like them (who are thier competitors) who only focus on HE and another company
      who focuses on only FE so i can say we are all of the same company by using
      opacity of same colour. what do you think? good or bad? thanks.

  body: The big problem with it printing in B&W is that the values of the colors are
    so close-only the blue ring is distinct. Work up the values in percentages of
    gray, then reapply colors screened to match the gray values, or colors of similar
    value, and it should convert well to B&W.

  body: "I kind of liked the concentrated arrangement of rings that you originally
    had. All I meant was that I'd like to see them go in front of and behind each
    other, linked together instead of being simply stacked. I think that interconnected
    rings would convey the overall shape better instead of existing as individual
    rings. \r\n\r\nI would have tried to simulate it with your logo, but the large
    version of the logo seems to be missing. So I'll try to illustrate what I mean
    in a poorly-rendered two second photoshop sketch: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rings_6593.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    left represents what you had, and the right represents what I meant...kind of.
    But now, seeing your logo at small sizes, I don't know if that will really make
    a difference. So take it or leave it.\r\n\r\nI like what you've been doing with
    the type, and prefer it within the rings instead of without. The all blue solutions
    do give you a better sense of the overall shape, and would definitely help with
    the black and white issue. \r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\nDavid"

  body: i;ve done more work to this logo and trying to make it work in b/w too so
    i went with one colour and done them in different gradients. what do you think?
    and i'm still wondering how the olympic logo would work in b/w when each ring
    is different colour and aren't logos suppose to be 2 colours excluding black and
    white? and do you think i should have the actual name of the company Mixed Economy
    Group under the logo like in this logo http://typophile.com/node/29148 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/updated_logos_6087.png]

    in school I was taught the same thing. If the logo/mark doesn't work in black
    and white only it can't be a very good logo. But, when you have the budget to
    control something, as the Olympics does, they never have to worry about there
    logo being in black and white. (ehe. Maybe they regret that sometimes.) The fact
    that you are going to great lengths to make sure your mark works in different
    ways is good. I think the single line weight as opposed to several is probably
    a safer bet. You might consider the line weight at different sizes. Are there
    fewer lines when it gets smaller?"

      talking about the logo in its self i.e. the circles? and when you said ''Treat
      the mark and the logotype as two separate elements. Especially in this instance,
      as I think the logotype greatly detracts from the mark'', did you mean that
      the ''meg'' in the logo is different to the type on the side (the other variations
      i have done on the right hand side). is that what you meant? do you think taht
      because its wrong and shouldn''t be there. tehre should just be 1 thing saying
      Meg not twice. is taht wrong or no0t good? i''d like your thought on that please.
      do you think that the circles with the ''meg'' in is itself a logo and does
      not need the type Mixed Economy Group. is that what you meant? thanks'

  body: "I prefer this in a single colour with tints, the solid colour rings cancel
    each other out rather and give almost a spirograph impression, wheras the lighter
    colours in the other version are obscured and also draw comparisons with the Olympics
    as has been noted. I would, for most uses, include the full name, however that
    needs to work with the text in the circles, by which I mean that it should align
    to some aspect of the type. The bottom two on the left of your latest post especially
    would benefit from this, it will also make the circles more dynamic by emphasising
    the eccentric position of meg. You could also try ranged right text under the
    circles ranging on the right of meg.\r\nTim"
