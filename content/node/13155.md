  delete and such) no longer work in Photoshop CS. I have tried deleting the Preference
  files, as well as re-installing. Anyone have any idea what it might be? They (ie:
  CTRL-Z, CTRL-P, etc.) work in all the other programs, just not Photoshop.\r\n\r\nYou
  don't realize how much you use keyboard shortcuts until they are gone."

  body: "No, nothing major really.\r\nI didnt just upgrade either.\r\n\r\nNormally
    this type of thing happens, you can kill the preference files and they will rebuild
    them on next startup. But this doesnt work either, its so wierd. I reset all of
    the shortcuts, too.\r\n\r\nOhh well.\r\n\r\nI should be getting CS2 here soon,
    so I guess I just wait until then.\r\n"

  body: Did you assign new shortcut on other application? It could have a conflic
    with new font even this seems impossible. I recently experienced that. Have you
    try to work with Photoshop without any other application? Have you try an older
    version of Photoshop?

  body: This may sound nuts, but I've heard MS Office can conflict with the keyboard
    shortcuts in CS apps, even if it's not running. Do you have Office installed?

    forums:\r\n\r\nDee Holmes - 1:13pm Apr 30, 05 PST (#1 of 12)\t\t\r\nYou need to
    either update Entourage and Microsoft Word or get rid of them. I chose the latter.
    \r\n\r\nMorton Z - 2:06pm Apr 30, 05 PST (#2 of 12)\t\t\r\nThanks. Is it the whole
    Office suite, or just both or one of the ones you mention? \r\n\r\nDee Holmes
    - 4:46am May 2, 05 PST (#3 of 12)\t\t\r\nSorry, I ment to say Microsoft Office
    not Word. It's both Entourage and Office that needs the update. Also, you can't
    have the Terminal application running in the background. \r\n\r\nMorton Z - 7:04am

    - 5:06pm May 2, 05 PST (#5 of 12)\t\t\r\nI had this same problem when I had a
    password on Entourage none of the shortcuts on any Adobe program worked. The simple
    fix was to take the password off. \r\n\r\nMorton Z - 8:11am Jun 1, 05 PST (#9
    of 12)\t\t\r\nI installed the most recent update to Office (at Dee's suggestion)
    and the problem disappeared. I have a password in Entourage and that doesn't matter.
    I think there's even a more recent update now. "
