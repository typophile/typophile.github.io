  for this old documentary series and I was just wondering if perhaps there's a better
  match? The tail of the Y is vertical in the logo and in Broadway it's slanted. Is
  there a similar typeface likely to have been used that fits better?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any/all responses.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hwood_4802.jpg]"

  body: Of the various Broadways (and lookalikes) I found (using http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/
    and http://www.whatfontis.com/), those with a vertical Y have a thick tail, while
    your sample has a thin one.
