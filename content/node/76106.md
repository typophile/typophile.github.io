  on this classic movie soundtrack cover. From my own searches the nearest font I
  found was \"Sonora\", but this isn't quite right. Anyone have any ideas?\r\n\r\nI
  have attached an image and here is a link to an online version:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.moviemusic.com/cdcovers/285/angelonmyshoulder.gif\r\n\r\nThanks."
