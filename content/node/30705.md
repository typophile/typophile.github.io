body: "I'm looking for a definitive list of system fonts that are required for Windows
  (XP). Currently, my Windows Fonts folder is filled with almost 500 individual files
  and I know I don't need to have that many fonts loaded at once. I currently use
  Suitcase 9.2 to manage my fonts and I've noticed some conflicts with preloaded fonts
  and when I activate/deactivate fonts. \r\n\r\nI came across this topic : http://typophile.com/node/9071
  and have since removed all the fonts from .../program files/common files/adobe/fonts...\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any information? I know enough to keep my web fonts, but what systems
  specific fonts do I need to keep?"

    for more of a minimalistic list, the basic fonts necessary to run windows and
    use the web without problems. I know a good bit of the fonts in my windows fonts
    directory were probably loaded when I installed Microsoft Office, those I definitely
    don't need, but I don't want to start deleting willy-nilly. \r\n\r\nI appreciate
    the attempt Jackie."

    that this list is for Windows and a few select applications; other applications
    you may have (e.g., CS2) may require other fonts.\r\n\r\nI've also seen suggestions
    that say to copy all the fonts from C:\\Windows\\Fonts to a backup folder, then
    delete everything in the \\Fonts folder and let Windows restore the default fonts,
    but I don't know if I'd do that myself. Plus, all the default but non-critical
    fonts that you don't want would be restored, too.\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nI'm beginning to think, there isn't a specific list, and that it varies
    per system. I went with the above, and it shrank my current list significantly.
    I appreciate the feed back, and hope that this has helped a few of the \"quiet
    commentors\" on Typophile. "

  body: "The only TrueType fonts required by Windows XP are:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Marlett
    (hidden by default)\r\n<li>Tahoma\r\n<li>Tahoma Bold\r\n<li>Microsoft Sans Serif\r\n<li>Franklin
    Gothic Medium\r\n<li>Franklin Gothic Medium Italic</ul>\r\n\r\nIf you remove any
    of the above fonts, Windows XP will automatically restore them within a few seconds.\r\n\r\nIn
    addition to those, I recommend that you keep at least the following fonts installed:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Arial
    (all four fonts: Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic)\r\n<li>Times New Roman
    (all four)\r\n<li>Courier New (all four)\r\n<li>Symbol\r\n<li>Wingdings</ul>\r\n\r\nFor
    Web browsing, you'll probably want to keep the rest of the families included in
    the Microsoft Core Fonts for the Web:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Andale Mono\r\n<li>Comic
    Sans MS\r\n<li>Georgia\r\n<li>Impact\r\n<li>Trebuchet MS\r\n<li>Verdana\r\n<li>Webdings</ul>\r\n\r\nThat
    covers Windows XP. Pretty soon, though, we'll be seeing a lot of the new fonts
    that come with Windows Vista and Office 2007. Of those, the most crucial font
    families are Segoe UI (the new default interface typeface in Windows Vista) and
    Calibri (the new default typeface in Word, Excel, and Outlook).\r\n\r\nEdit: Well,
    looks like I was a little too slow. The <a href=\"http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/aboutgraphics/a/fontoverload_3.htm\">article</a>
    linked to by Gus Winterbottom covers the basics fairly nicely (though not 100%
    accurately)."

    I have Segoe UI and the Vista fonts already (found them from early adapters.)
    and will keep them in the mix. \r\n\r\nI'm down to 69 font files now. That's amazing. "

  body: Glad to help. Just remember to leave the .FON files alone (they're the ones
    that have an <cite>A</cite> icon). Strictly speaking, some of them can actually
    be safely removed, but their collective footprint is so small that it's not really
    worth the effort to sort through them.

    forget to backup your fonts to a spare folder before deleting them. \r\n\r\n>That
