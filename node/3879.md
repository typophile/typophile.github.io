  Expert sets in OTF format at special prices. It seems an opportune time to load
  up on book faces. The problem is which sets. <BR> <BR>Assuming the limitations of
  a cheap desktop inkjet printer for printing, would anyone care to critique their
  favorite digital fonts and pan the turkeys? <BR> <BR>I have in mind, e.g., Centaur
  and Fournier, whose digital versions have been criticized as light or spindly, versus,
  say, Aldus or Dante whose digital versions have been better received. <BR> <BR>How
  about Franta Storm&#39;s OTF trilogy: Jannon, Baskerville, Walbaum? Has anyone any
  experience working with them? For $122 a pop, would I be pleased with the printed
  results? <BR> <BR>Which book faces work well for you and which book faces do not? '
