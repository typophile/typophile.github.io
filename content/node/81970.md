  have added Kashida for Init, Med, Final & Iso, by replacing it with Character +
  U+0640 and I am getting the required result by simply adding it to RLIG, but I have
  to type each time Character + Tatweel key in my text.\r\nCan someone explain which
  one is supported by MS Word, I read SS01~20 support upto 20 alternates and also
  Word Support it. If I use any of them how I will get the substitute in MS Word,
  and what will be the process in MS Volt.\r\nAnyone can put screen shot of MS Volt
  using any of above features especially support by MS Word, or any font having any
  of above feature available with VOLT Source.\r\nThanx."

  body: 'The problem here is that all software that applies automatic kashida insertion
    for text justification does so, as you would expect, after all other Arabic text
    shaping for the line is complete. At that stage, it is too late for any of your
    OpenType Layout glyph substitutions or positioning involving the kashida, because
    OTL processing has been completed. This means that automatic kashida insertion
    only works for flat, horizontal Arabic type styles, and not for any styles in
    which the kashida is shaped as an elongation of the letter. I''ve discussed this
    at length with people at Microsoft and Adobe, and they''re aware of the problem
    and also of what needs to be done to fix it at the glyph level(running at least
    some OTL features twice: once before kashida insertion and once after), but there
    are complications regarding line length and kashida width that need to be figured
    out.'

  body: "Thanx John for the clarification. But this issue is all softwares just add
    a straight line. A good feature like JALT (Justification Alt) is a very good option,
    but I read somewhere that no software supports this feature. Also I think this
    feature may only replace one substitute.\r\n\r\nIn my case I've created 3~4 shapes
    of each, Init, Med, Final & Iso. and I want them to place them according to space.
    They only way now I have is to put 0640 character for 1~2~3 or 4 times with the
    shape where I need it to replace.\r\n"

  body: Yes, for the time being you'll need to manually justify text using the U+0640
    character. I think this software issue will be sorted out eventually, but it is
    tricky in various ways. My dream is really intelligent kashida justification with
    user preferences, so that one can affect the overall appearance of paragraphs
    of text with different kinds of justification models, all applied automatically
    following calligraphic rule variations.

    John. You are absolutely right. but it may takes a long time. Also Application
    developers have their own priorities. But for Arabic, Urdu & Persian like languages
    needs it so much."

  body: "I suspect we will see improvements in stages: first in kashida insertion
    logic (i.e. where kashidas are inserted and how they are prioritised), and then
    in kashida shaping behaviour (i.e. handling of curved elongations, displacement
    of marks onto elongations etc.). The latter is complicated by the fact that a
    lot of software has mistakenly relied on a presumed flat baseline stroke to implement
    kashidas using overlapped elongation glyphs to justify across different distances.
    This not only causes problems for fonts with curved elongations when no post-insertion
    OpenType Layout is applied (one ends up with multiple curved kashida glyphs!),
    but cannot be directly solved by kashida ligation within the font OTL tables,
    because this will result in absolute width glyphs that may be narrower or wider
    than the calculated justification distance. I have some ideas about how to solve
    this, but need to discuss them with software engineers to determine how feasible
    they are.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, justification algorithms are one of those areas
    in which software companies attempt to compete, rather than standardise."

    that is a good thing because it creates an environment in which a great deal more
    innovation is possible. The World Wide Web is an excellent example of the benefits
    of standardisation, and Web 2.0 is ample evidence of the innovation that this
    standardisation made possible.\r\n\r\nLikewise, we font developers could innovate
    much more easily if we could rely on standardised approaches to text justification
    in applications."
