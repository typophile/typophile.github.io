    computer. But here is a picture of my sketches for the SBL Hebrew typeface. This
    is the first time I&#39;ve used this approach: writing letters with a broad-nib
    pen. This was mainly of value in determining good proportions and for getting
    the relative weight of stems correct &#40;especially the median weight of diagonal
    strokes that is important for Hebrew because of the steep ductus&#41;. If you
    compared these sketches to the final font, you would find that a lot of details
    are different, but the overall proportions of the letters are about the same.

    in the context of sketching type, Gerrit Noordzij discusses a kind of shading
    as a sketching technique on pages 51-52 of <i>Letterletter</i>: <BR> <BR><i>The
    moving counterpoint is conveniently represented by zigzag shading which evokes
    the shape very quickly. Different levels of articulation are reached with different
    densities of shading. The effectiveness and speed of this method can persuade
    students to abandon drawing outlines, and only then can design start. The speed
    also encourages them to make the alternatives they would otherwise only talk about.
    So we got used to a practice of discussing design by quickly shading the subjects
    of the discussion.</i> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve experimented a little with this technique,
    and think it has a lot of value. Earlier this year, I watched Erik van Blokland
    sketch some letters in this way -- he&#39;s had a lot more practice at it than
    I have -- and was impressed by the speed with which one got a sense of letter
    as a solid thing.'

    in my quote from Noordzij, because I don&#39;t think one has to accept that aspect
    of his ideas in order to appreciate the usefulness of shading as a technique in
    sketching type. It isn&#39;t even necessary to sketch in a way that represents
    the moving counterpoint. <BR> <BR>You might consider this: shading letters produces
    immediate notan, while drawing outlines certainly does not. You can shade letters
    at a comfortable size -- a couple of inches tall for caps, say -- and immediately
    step back with a reducing glass&#42; and get a sense of how they are going to
    work as type. <BR> <BR>&#42; I thoroughly recommend all type designers invest
    in a reducing glass. Fiona Ross pulled one out of her bag when we were looking
    at some 144pt Arabic sketches a couple of years ago: it was wonderful because
    one could actually get a sense of how the letters were going to work at smaller
    size. Very useful device: almost as essential as a linen tester.'

    <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no doubt it&#39;s useful. It saves time and nicely abstracts
    the presence of the hand in the forms. But it ties you to the hand, so the results
    are regressive. The reader&#39;s eye never asked for help from the writer&#39;s
    hand. <BR> <BR>As for notan, on paper shading gets you to a black shape faster,
    but there&#39;s good notan and bad notan. The act of shading creates a relationship
    between the two &#34;moving points&#34; at the extremes. You cannot have both
    that and a sound relationship between the black and the white. You cannot for
    example account for optical scaling or trapping. But most of all you&#39;re limiting
    yourself in structure. It&#39;s like exploring by hugging the coast of your own
    continent, while the liberation from the hand -and hopefully the subsequent reliance
    on the true nature of readability- is the astrolabe that allows the discovery
    of new continents. <BR> <BR>The reason to draw outlines &#40;and then fill them
    in, sure&#41; is simply that that&#39;s what the represents what the reader sees.
    Shading represents more what the designer wants to express. <BR> <BR>BTW, didn&#39;t
    you say you generally draw directly on the computer anyway? <BR> <BR>&#62; It
    isn&#39;t even necessary to sketch in a way that represents the moving counterpoint.
    <BR> <BR>Are you sure? How would somebody like van Blokland justify the deviation?

    the presence of the hand in the forms or to any fixed relationship between the
    moving edges of the extremes. Noordzij uses shading in a particular way, but it
    is far from the only way. I&#39;m interested in shading as a technique to put
    down ideas quickly, not to force my ideas into a particular model. Yes, I generally
    draw directly on the computer, but when I&#39;m sitting in a cafe I sometimes
    draw letters and work out ideas that I later implement on the computer, usually
    without reference to the drawings, which are part of the thinking process not
    capital-D Designs. <BR> <BR> <BR>My reducing glass isn&#39;t particularly strong:

    but at least you can show examples in black &amp; white, so to speak! <BR> <BR>&#62;
    isn&#39;t this too generic? <BR> <BR>If by &#34;generic&#34; you mean &#34;too
    theoretical&#34;, then I would point to a gem of an example that brings it all
    into the real world: chirography says that the two edges of the black must be
    related - this means you can&#39;t really contol notan fully - this can only be
    done through <i>outlines</i>. Chirography precludes optical effects, trapping,
    and all those <i>typographic</i> subtleties. It&#39;s kiddie type design. <BR>
    <BR>If you mean &#34;obvious&#34;, I would raise a caution: Noordzij talks the
    talk when it comes to notan, but his &#34;moving front&#34; clearly violates notan&#39;s
    primacy &#40;in the realm of type if not chirography&#41;. It&#39;s sweetly ironic
    that the wonderful formalization of chirography performed by Noordzij allows one
    to fight it better. Without his &#34;help&#34;, I for one wouldn&#39;t have such
    a solid explanation of how chirography fails. <BR> <BR>&#62; Latin text requires
    &#39;even color&#39; .... while in <BR>&#62; Japanese any attempt to evenness
    is impossible; <BR> <BR>Hey, you&#39;ve make me realize something great! Japanese
    is a great counterpoint &#40;pardon the pun&#41; against mainstream beliefs about
    what Latin type should be: Totally even color&#42; is bad for readability &#40;no
    matter the writing system&#41;. Sure Japanese is much harder to enslave in terms
    of even color, and maybe that makes it &#34;snap out of it&#34; and not suffer
    under such a fallacy. The uneven color in Janapese is actually a huge functional
    benefit. Latin has yet to grasp that &#40;although it has had a hint of it in
    the past, like in some Eastern European efforts&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, I forgot
    to address a previous question of yours: the difference between color and notan
    is that the former is merely a measure of darkness. The idea of Texture though
    is another animal, but you could say it fits within notan nicely. As for Rhythm,
    there is none. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Something else about the origins of the term
    &#34;notan&#34;: as far as I know the Japanese use it within calligraphy, rock
    gardening, and many other forms of expression. I would propose that it&#39;s not
    well suited to any calligraphy that needs to convey textual content, and if I
    were a Japanese calligrapher &#40;something twice removed from reality :-&#41;
    I would start a new school were you draw hair-thin outlines, not bodies. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Actually, &#39;black and white&#39; is misleading. Notan is about &#39;dark
    and light&#39;, not just the extremes of black and white. One of the most important
    traditional uses of notan is in <i>sumi-e</i> painting, which typically involves
    a full range of greys.

    would be that, in chirography, the edges of the black are determined by the nature
    of the writing tool. If the writing tool is a pointed split nib or, referring
    back to Japanese calligraphy, a brush, the relationship of the edges of the black
    are determined by pressure. The key aspect of chirography is that it is made up
    of strokes, not outlines, so the relationship of the edges of the black is always
    the relationship of two sides of a single stroke.'

    at your precious notan: you need to know exactly what the filled in result is
    going to look like even as you are drawing the outlines. It seems to me that there
    is much to be said for working directly with the notan, i.e. in solid black and
    white, and your objection to stroke-based processes doesn&#39;t necessarily preclude
    other methods. A couple of possibilities: <BR> <BR>1. Design type on black scratchboard,
    removing the surface to expose the white area in and around the black letterforms.
    <BR> <BR>2. Design type on black paper using white paint to define the space around

    like <BR> <BR>Here you&#39;re touching on what might be called &#34;arbitrariness&#34;,
    and this is in fact one reason some people love chirography: it brings a tangible
    order to creation, since a physical tool &#40;either in the first-hand or virtually&#41;
    helps you decide where things end up. That&#39;s why I say that chirography is
    a great practical shortcut. <BR> <BR>But the catch is two-fold: <BR>1&#41; There&#39;s
    no reason to believe that the reader needs what the hand favors. <BR>2&#41; Control
    shouldn&#39;t be the objective. Letting go -accepting the arbitrariness of it
    all anyway- helps you escape the confines of chirography. <BR> <BR>The reason
    the &#34;moving front&#34; precludes good notan &#40;a notan that the <i>reader</i>
    needs&#41; is simply that the White is made subservient to the Black &#40;and
    it doesn&#39;t matter what color the two are&#41;. It is made subservient to satisfy
    the creator, but at the expense of the user. <BR> <BR>The tricky thing though
    is that -in type design- you can&#39;t create the White the same way as you create
    the Black. In Latin type design especially with its &#34;atomic&#34; Blacks it&#39;s
    hard to take the White seriously: it exists in a half-world - some of it is internal
    to the Black, but some of it takes shape only when multiple Blacks come together
    - something that happens outside the control of the type designer. This complexity
    makes chirography even more appealing... but it&#39;s still a cop-out. <BR> <BR>--
    <BR> <BR>James, I&#39;ve only seen oriental calligraphy on TV, but I respect it
    because it doesn&#39;t pretend to be anything besides self-expression - Art. It
    doesn&#39;t pretend to be very good at conveying the literal text. The same goes
    for that Jack Stauffacher stuff&#42;: I don&#39;t mind people setting very large
    type in color at an angle and slamming the letterpress as long as they admit to
    doing it as self-expression. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/20603.html"
