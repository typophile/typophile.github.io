body: "Hello- this typeface is a bit different from bauhaus, but not quite the same.
  For example, the line in a lowercase 'e' in bauhaus is slanted, but this one is
  straight. Also, the lowercase 'h' in this one has a really distinctive curve. Does
  anyone know what this is?\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chesterfieldlogo2_6454.jpg]"
