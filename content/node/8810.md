  body: This could be very close to Psy/Ops Armchair Modern. The sample below was
    made with the D weight, but it comes in three lighter weights and one heavier
    weight. &#40;You need to use the lower case and Alternate E to make this.&#41;  <BR><img

  body: Here is the <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_armchair.html" target="_blank">Link
    to the Psy/Ops page</a> for Armchair Modern. <BR> <BR>&#40;By the way, the C in
    my sample was upper case, so I used a mix. The upper case L has a square corner;
    the lower case L is rounded a bit.&#41;

  body: Mike, my first instinct was to think this might be a pixel font, since the
    lines were so sharp and straight. <BR> <BR>I took a look at DaFont and I think
    this might be <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/bitmap.php?page=1&amp;nb_ppp_old=40&amp;text=LanCE&amp;nb_ppp=40&amp;classt=alpha"
    target="_blank">04b_20</a>, in a string of &#34;LanCE&#34;.

  body: That doesn&#39;t happen. It&#39;s a copyrighted font.  <BR> <BR>This isn&#39;t
    the place to look for help finding free &#40;illegal&#41; versions of commercial
    fonts. <BR> <BR>If you need it, buy it. It&#39;s the right thing to do.

  body: Thank you for all your help <BR>but that&#39;s not what I meant I do not want
    to steal anyone&#39;s propriety. <BR>I meant a free font not a paid copyrighted
    font.  <BR>I am sure there is a font out there that free  <BR>kind regards
