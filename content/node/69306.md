body: "I'm starting a print and web project that will use Helvetica almost exclusively,
  at text and display sizes, for web, brochures, postcards, bookmarks, posters, wayfinding
  signage, and so on. I've seen the face used quite nicely--for example, by Gary Hustwit
  and many of the designers shown in his <em>Helvetica</em>, and in Lars M\xFCller's
  <em>Helvetica</em> books. But I've also seen it used poorly, and I have seen that
  even the Neue cut has its problems in use--like having only tabular figures, for
  example, so that the 1 has a mile of space around it. \r\n\r\nSo I'm curious: what
  would people who've used the face successfully advise a newcomer like me to do to
  make sure I get the most out of Helvetica Neue? I'm looking for GREP suggestions
  in InDesign to deal with the 1 and other spacing problems, general tips or rules
  of thumb for leading, kerning, and tracking--anything you've hit upon that made
  working with the face better. (This includes other Typophile threads that I might
  have overlooked, by the way.) \r\n\r\n(P.S.: I'm really not interested in starting
  a discussion about whether we all like or hate Helvetica, whether or not it's the
  best face for this particular job, or whether another face would work better. I'm
  satisfied it's an appropriate choice for the project, and I'm really just looking
  for advice for using it from people with more experience and expertise than I have.)"

    the main movie or the out-takes\u2014nails it as far as a general guideline. He
    says that Helvetica is \"fat in the middle\", so it needs a lot of space around
    it, in this case white space. A few words in a bold weight, artfully placed with
    a lot of white space around it, and it can look great. In extended text, \"it
    looks like dog shit,\" to quote Paul Rand. "

    it\u2019s big. I think that\u2019s the real strength of Helvetica; the bold just
    beats everything out there if you make it huge and track it tight. Add any crazy
    contemporary color combination and it\u2019s the design equivalent of a spiked
    bat. Unfortunately that has resulted in designers assuming it\u2019s good for
    other things, and it really isn\u2019t."

    use \"tight but not touching\" for display setting, then make sure that no letters
    touch.\r\nThis will require extensive manual kerning (bottom), as the default
    spacing (top) is designed for text.\r\nIf you merely track closer (centre), the
    effect doesn't work.\r\nBTW, this spacing technique relates to two specific technologies
    that were popular in the 1960s, phototypositor and dry transfer (Letraset).\r\n\r\nHere
    are a couple of examples of this retro look, the first from a 1969 Pepsi ad, the
    second from a 2003 American Apparel ad.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pepsi_4957.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aa_4761.png]"

    text sizes:\r\nI would try set it as loose as the Neue Helvetica-character allows.
    It needs a generous line-height. The numbers are problematic, especially in small
    sizes, check combinations of 0369 because of its stylized, closed forms that it
    makes them hard to differentiate. Regarding the tabular numbers, changing \"metric\"
    to \"optical\" helps a bit. Tracking manually would do better of course.\r\n\r\ngreetings
