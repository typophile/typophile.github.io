  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>_O  ________________  God&rsquo;s Word</p>
<p>Surely, I fear no sword
And love God&rsquo;s Word</p>
<p>He  watches what we patch
And warns us from others hatch!</p>
<p>Let us leap not before we look,
Don&rsquo;t you see  wisdom in His Book?</p>
<p>Only to Him, I do put the flight
Only for Him, I must do right + fight</p>
<p>Your head, do you scratch?
To Democracy , what a latch!</p>
<p>_ 1 ________________  Prawns, let us fry!</p>
<p>Prawns, let us fry! 
Why was I born and will die? 
How should I dive or fly?
&hellip;
Winner if I know how and why?! 
Loser If do not know how and why?! 
Exploited if I know how but not why?!
&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait! why I was given ear and eye? 
Guided to the how only if I know why 
To make a hole in the dry 
Or a ladder in the sky?!</p>
<p>_ 2 ________________  Rock and Roll</p>
<p>Rock and Roll 
Drive and Stroll 
Go shopping Stalls and Mall 
Juggle One+One ball 
Get installed and Install 
Click and Scroll 
&hellip; 
&hellip; 
&hellip; 
As long as there&rsquo;s soul! 
Before going to a windowless hole, 
Does on that rotate our goal and role? 
Let&rsquo;s go to Poll 
And hang it up the pole!</p>
<p>_ 3 ________________ New World Order</p>
<p>Played AC+DC 
From Sky+Sea 
Without Mercy!
&hellip;
Here is AC 
In need of PC+WC 
But wanted to be DC!
&hellip;</p>
<p>There is DC 
In need of PC+WC 
But wanted to be AC!
&hellip;</p>
<p>AC or DC? 
Just want to see
&hellip;</p>
<p>For those who know ABC 
Where is the fallacy?</p>
<p>_ 4 ________________ President + VIP</p>
<p>VIP: In politics, I am not supposed to engage 
Though everything in wreckage+garbage 
Never stop giving you White Image</p>
<p>President: Have you received the Package?</p>
<p>VIP: More important now is to whiten my image!</p>
<p>President: Any Leakage?</p>
<p>VIP: Have been re-flipping the Same Books page by page 
Mine, I am supposed to suppress to a single usage 
But, thanks to the free time and high wage 
mmmmm, I have been trapped by Underage 
&hellip; 
Next morning, and on every Frontpage 
The Opposition has taken Underage hostage! 
And the people stage a protest of Outrage 
&hellip;. 
Day after next, 3 images on every Frontpage 
The hostage in bandage! 
A Deaf and Dumb in cage! 
VIP waving to huge Crowd down the stage!</p>
<p>_ 5 ________________  Democracy</p>
<p>Till when we allow Kapi+Soci play their demo game. 
Flipping and Rotating us with parties shame. 
Neither has solutions for our problems as they claim. 
Where, when, how and by who they came? 
Who gave them the right to speak in our name? 
How do they know Man&rsquo;s ins+outs and aim. 
Being tools in either hands, ourselves we have to blame</p>
<p>_ 6 ________________  Arabic Type</p>
<p>Type is nothing but to Assemble, Compile and Shuffle 
&hellip; Letters on lines to make people bubble 
Towards that end, PC fonts are handled and tackled 
The inspired by butterfly and Candle is lovable and durable 
But the inspired by beetle&rsquo;s tentacles is terribly horrible 
Plenty are the Samples but few are the Examples 
&hellip; 
In Type, every movement is probable: Scramble and Scribble 
Ligatures and Kerning are the most distinguishing variables 
Ligatures is to bundle: couple, triple and Quadrable 
Kerning is the art of snuggle and nestle 
In these, the Arabic script has no double.
&hellip;</p>
<p>Before I make it, I fondle from all sides and angles 
My fingers, I do wriggle and fiddle 
For &ldquo;o&rdquo; I go round in circle, like a spindle 
When the &ldquo;Alif&rdquo; goes like needle and the REST flexible, 
I wrestle and wrestle to make it wonderfully single 
As Twins are not allowed, unless the new outlook is remarkable 
&hellip; 
Ending my riddle, one thing that will puzzle U and baffle 
I dont even own a bicycle, and my bills I hardly settle 
To the 99% I do belong, and gainst the 1% I still struggle and wrangle</p>
<hr>
<p>With Flowers, hope I have kindled a candle</p>
