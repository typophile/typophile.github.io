  b) the first entry is of the class assignment variety. Nevertheless, this will also
  enable me to kill two birds with one stone (assuming I've still got a good throwin'
  arm).\r\n\r\nAlright, down to brass tacks. The assignment was to find a book cover
  that interests us and analyze the interaction between image and text. The book cover
  I chose is from the newest chronicle by one of my favorite authors, John Hodgman
  (of the <cite>Daily Show</cite> and Apple's <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=en&rls=en&q=stephen%20colbert&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wv#q=apple%20commercial%20john%20hodgman&hl=en&emb=0\">commercials</a>).
  His latest creation, <cite>More Information Than You Require</cite> (much like its
  predecessor, <cite>The Areas of My Expertise</cite>) is positively German in its
  efficient, effective, and hilarious use of space. Even the front cover (see image)
  could be considered a chapter or prologue on its own. Large shadowed block lettering
  lets you know exactly what this book is. One of the jokes that you may have to be
  familiar with is the concept of utter shamelessness and boldfaced faux self-righteousness
  exhibited by Hodgman (others include the likes of <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=en&rls=en&q=stephen%20colbert&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wv#\">Stephen
  Colbert</a> and <a href=\"http://www.someamerican.com/musicculture/2008/9/2/because-when-i-think-of-rock-n-roll-dennys-is-the-first-thin.html\">Jesse
  Hughes</a>). Finally what I consider to make these covers true success stories is
  that the contents of the inside of the book are just not enough to quench my thirst
  for this man's writing. I absolutely need every bit of word play, outlandish language,
  and absurd non-information, and if it takes using the front cover, back cover and
  both inside sleeves to do it, then anchors away.\r\n\r\nJohn Hodgman book covers:\r\n<a
  href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3276/2806930269_acf2539e47_b.jpg\"><cite>More
  Information Than You Require<cite></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.umsl.edu/~chemist/books/halspicks/Covers/AreasOfMyExpertise.jpg\"><cite>The
  Areas of My Expertise<cite></a>\r\n\r\nOKAY! Thats all out of the way. Seriously
  though, these books are a riot on wheels and you'd do yourself good to snag a copy.
  \r\nUntil next time, dear readers. Remember to eat your vegetables and tell your
  mother you love her.\r\n\r\n"
