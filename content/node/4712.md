    double-post or an entry you&#39;d  <BR>like to erase, just replace the contents
    by &#34;x2&#34; or add  <BR>a little comment and I&#39;ll take care of it. Do
    you want me  <BR>to make your post above disappear?

  body: Lissenup, I checked the Stool PDF and I think it probably <BR><i>is</i> Stool.
    Anyone feels like e-mailing the boys from <BR>Underware to ask them directly?

    something kinda unpleasant...

    is it a font or a hand drawn one? cheers
