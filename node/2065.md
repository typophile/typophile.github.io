  body: Jason, <BR>Just a quick note and I gues this may be deliberate? but it reads
    FUS not FYs? which could have both negative and posative implications. Too much
    fuss. I like the almost hand drawn approach to the three atoms and the way you
    have ballanced the coffee lettering with some heavy posative kerning, demonstrating
    some mature typogrphical consideration. Not into the FUZ, not liking the F and
    Z and I&#39;m not even sure the futuristic look you where going for works with
    the rest of the sytle. Although there is something appealing about the U, sorry
    Y?

  body: Jason, as coffee is a food item &#40;sort of&#41; and food items should be
    attractive, at least to the tastebud part of our brians, I&#39;m not sure you
    have found the right direction. Could you show us your sketches/thumbnails?

  body: jason --- i&#39;d take a look at the F U and S ... <BR>They are legible forms,
    but odd and uninviting. <BR>Putting them on different baselines might not be helping.
    <BR> <BR>Seems like the letter U could be a coffee cup with <BR>the atoms above
    it, where normally steam <BR>would be rising off? <BR> <BR>Or, maybe not. Forcing
    a cup into a coffee logo might be cliche. <BR> <BR>You could also put a line over
    the u to indicate <BR>a Long U perhaps. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: Jason, look at making the atoms coffee beans if you want to have a toung-in-cheek
    approach. It would be like a line of juice drinks here called &#34;Sir Real&#34;
    they use campy fake Surrealist Images on their products &#40;and some of the worst
    type treatments I&#39;ve ever seen&#41;. Heed, Tiffany&#39;s comment, its right
    on. Dan

  body: daniel - <BR>i actually had the atoms as coffee beans in one of my sketches,
    and one where the atoms were flying around a coffee bean... i thought it might
    be a bit cheesy.. and also thought it wouldnt work because the atoms are supposed
    to be coffee, creamer, and sugar coming together as one.. but I might be attmepting
    to be to literal. Ill give the beans thing a shot and work on the type.  <BR>
    <BR>Sorry about not being able to scan my sketches tiffany, my scanner is not
    being very nice to me lately <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>paul- <BR>i might not be using the umlaut correctly.
    the company was originally called fuze. i had experimented with different ways
    of spelling the same word... fuse and f

  body: 'Jason, don&#39;t let the logo dictate the marketing. The  marketing is the
    cream sugar and coffee all in one. I think you should simplify the mark and let
    the packaging tell the marketing story. So concentrate on a mark that creates
    an umbrella for the coffee company. What if they came out with a coffee that after
    you drank it you&#39;d have a mint after taste in your mouth. Ask yourself does
    the mark allow the coffee company to grow. Dan '

  body: ok i altered the letterforms a bit &#40;simplified&#41; and last night was
    able to get my first rough out for the packaging concept. any suggestions would
    be great.. thanks everyone for all your help. <BR> <BR>Oh and the one on the left
    is transparent with a white knockout for the main graphic and the one on the right
    is printed on white paper. The circulating rings get lost on the transparent package,
    but are still subtly there which is kind of nice. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/21076.jpg"

  body: 'Jason think in terms of the entire line of coffees. What is the color scheme
    for Decafe for instance? I also would like the background of the logo to be a
    richer warmer color. Also think about possibly printing on a metalic foil label.
    That way you could use white as a color to print and the background of regular
    blend could have a yellow printed over a silver foil and a white regular blend
    printed over that.  That way you could let the silver knock  out from your richer
    brown color for your logo. It would be a rich label. In the case I propose you&#39;d
    need to include the &#34;All in one coffee filters&#34; into the single label. '
