    after you eat it ( fecal art doesn't count - thinking of a story by David Foster
    Wallce )\r\n\r\nI finally looked up the wiki-nition of trolling, \r\n<em> In Internet
    slang, a troll is someone who posts controversial, inflammatory, irrelevant or
    off-topic messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum
    or chat room, with the primary intent of provoking other users into an emotional
    response or to generally disrupt normal on-topic discussion.</em>\r\nother than\r\n\r\nI
    prefer to think of it as inspiring lively on-topic debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
