  this forums for quite a time now and found them to be very helpful.There is one
  topic however on which I am doing research on and couldn't find information on (please
  correct me if there was a thread on this). \r\n\r\nAre you aware of any article
  published on the use of blackletter type in American newspaper titles? Why has been
  the use of blackletter so popular amongst publishers an designers of many diferent
  kinds of newspapers in the US, big and respected as well as small and local ones?\r\n\r\nI
  will also appreciate your own thoughts and theories. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nMarek\r\n"

    we keep using them for our diplomas and degrees and such.  But since we're not
    used to reading it, we just keep it as the title and nothing more.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Thank you for your response. I thought this might be the line of reasoning
    -it evokes formality, authority etc. \r\nBut what does it mean \"simply looks
    formal\" after all? Why does Americans associate blackletter with authority? It
    certainly doesn't look very formal to me, but rather pretentious. We, i.e. in
    Poland, for intance never use it for diplomas etc., and I am not aware of any
    country in Europe where this would be the case. "

    in the 1860s in England. The papers wanted to attract attention by using the darkest
    type available, which in most print shops at the time was blackletter. \r\n\r\nSee
    Jim Parkinson, \"More than you ever wanted to know about nameplates\" in John
    D. Berry, ed., <cite>Contemporary newspaper design</cite>, 2004, Mark Batty Publisher,
    159--169."

  body: "Thank you Steve.\r\n\r\nThe idea that they used the darkest type available
    sounds very interesting as it shiftes the reasoning from evoking authority to
    catching attention. I'll read the article to see how the authors support their
    claim. \r\n\r\nHowever, as far as America is concerned many papers used blackletter
    already in the 1790.   According to Kevin G. Barnhurst, John C. Nerone in The
    Form of News: A History ( Guilford Press, 2002) many papers used blackletter \"because
    [it] provided a visual germanic clue, referring to the Teutonic origin of the
    English people and their ancient order\" (p. 54, book is available on google books).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Interesting.  But I wonder why people would want the link to Germanic history.\r\n\r\nI
    think the formalness comes in part from the complexity and calligraphic quality
    of the letters.  I'm talking out of my ass now, but I'd assume in the olden days
    degrees were considered important enough to be handlettered instead of typeset,
    and might have been done in an English blackletter.  Once universities started
    issuing so many degrees that they couldn't economically handletter the degrees,
    they wanted to maintain the style and simply switched to a blackletter font. This
    is pure speculation, but might be worth some investigation.  \r\n\r\nThen again,
    most European degrees I've seen are butt ugly (Spain's top university uses around
    seven different fonts on one sheet of paper including the largest type in Georgia\u2014a
    great SCREEN font)... I'll take my pretentious blackletter :)\r\n\r\nAlso keep
    in mind that many things are culturally \"learned\".  I could definitely see newspapers
    using blackletter for attention.  But we have \"learned\" that now for newspapers
    which are more serious.  I'm thinking about things like the USA Today etc, that
    use sans serif for their titles which then emphases an idea of blackletter=serious/formal.
    \ Again, just tossing ideas around.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan

  body: "@marek and @thompson\r\nWhile I don't have references on newspaper history
    at hand, you might recall that blackletter types were in common use when the first
    journals appeared, so the idea of authority is most probably based on its early
    appearance in print.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the Barnhurst & Narone book,
    but this conclusion seems rather broad, and would look at actual examples of newspapers
    and see if there is any text in those papers themselves that would support this
    assertion. Plus recall that blackletter is as much english as german as french
    etc. by manuscript (pre-typographic) tradition.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n"

  body: "I was about to post more or less exactly what Peter says in his 22sep09 note.\r\nI
    don't know that there was any \"desire for Teutonic identity\" involved, certainly,
    I've never considered any such reference before except, obviously, in German mastheads.\r\n\r\nThe
    fact that \"Blackletter\" is also widely called \"Old English\" is a better clue,
    and likely one would find English broadsides printed with 'mastheads' in such
    type back nearly to Caxton. This would then be a simple path to seeing the same
    structural form persist, if anachronistically, in the New York Times, et al, to
    the present day.\r\n\r\nAlthough my favorite \"Old English\" is BM Harley 2904...\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.british-library.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&IllID=21019

    this treasure, when I was studying calligraphy under Ieuan Rees in the early 1980s.
    Ieuan wrote a letter of introduction for me, and I was admitted to the rare book
    room at the British Library. Would love to get back there some day.)\r\n\r\nThe
    evolution of blackletter's cultural semantics is well documented in Peter Bain's
    and Paul Shaw's book:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Blackletter-National-Identity-Paul-Shaw/dp/1568981252\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://slowprint.com/
