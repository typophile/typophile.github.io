  element. Is kerning in SVG fonts supported by any web browser?\r\n\r\nI'm just trying
  to add kerning to my SVG fonts and it didn't work. I'm not sure what the source
  of the problem is, is it the lack of browser support or is it my font.\r\n\r\nAny
  info or reference implementation would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nEigi\r\n"
