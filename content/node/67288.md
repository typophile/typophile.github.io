  can I activate the feature in Indesign? In case of Adobe Caslon qwwwwe should be
  replaced by a border. I mean, I know, how to access the characters with the glyph
  pallet, but can I access them in the same way as the ligatures by activating the
  feature? \r\n\r\nI only found the explanation in the OpenType specs, but it is no
  help:\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ko.htm#ornm\r\n\r\nAny
  help much appreciated."

    directly supported by InDesign CS4 and earlier. You'd have to use the glyph panel.\r\n\r\nSee
    http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/OTGuide.pdf\r\n\r\nThere's a table at the
    back that shows which apps support which features.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    ornm;\r\n\r\n<cite>Well,behind the scenes... inserting stuff via the Glyph Panel
    can in fact activate OpenType features which there is no UI for otherwise.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhen
    you pick up the character rose from the glyph panel and type s or t then, s and
    t will not be replaced by the characters sunflower and tulip. Doesn\u2019t that
    mean, that the feature is not activated? I have recognized, that features are
    activated sometimes, when I pick up a glyph from the panel. Sometimes I first
    have to delete the glyph, that I had picked up from the panel, before the feature
    is permanently activated. I did not find real rules behind the behavior of Indesign
    with regard to that.\r\n\r\nAnd I have recognized a bug:\r\n\r\nfeature ss01 {#Stylistic
    Set 1\r\n\tignore sub a' @allExceptSpace;\r\n\tsub a' by a.fina;\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\nIn
    the moment, in which you add the ignore statement, the stylistic feature is not
    listed in the drop down list of the glyph panel anymore.\r\n\r\nExcept from that
    it would be very cool, if you could add a real name to those features. Example:\r\n\r\nfeature
    ss01 [title=\"latn dflt: Carl, DEU: Paul, TRK: Peter\"] {#Stylistic Set 1\r\n\tignore
    sub a' @allExceptSpace;\r\n\tsub a' by a.fina;\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\n"

    description</a>: Either ' or \".\r\n\r\nEdited:\r\n\r\nA comparison between the
    GSUB tables of the font genarated without the name tag has shown, that the only
    difference are a few empty featureParams-tags:\r\n\r\nWITHOUT THE NAME TAG\r\n
    \     &lt;FeatureRecord index=\"59\"&gt;\r\n        &lt;FeatureTag value=\"ss01\"/&gt;\r\n

    value=\"ss01\"/&gt;\r\n        &lt;Feature&gt;\r\n          &lt;FeatureParams&gt;\r\n

    \     &lt;/FeatureRecord&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom the Adobe OT feature file spec:\r\n\u201CThe
    implementation will store the name strings in the name table, and will create
    a feature parameter data block which references them.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo the feature
    parameter block was created, but shouldn\u2019t there be anything stored, that
    links to the name table, to the nameID 256?\r\n\r\nAt least I think, that my test
    has shown, that it is relatively easy to add those names with the help of TTX.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nNow
    I will check, if your tip with the lookup helps.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n1. The lookup
    does not help.\r\n2. It is not the ignore-statement, that makes the feature name
    missing in the drop down list of the glyph panel, but the pure presence of \u201C'\u201D
    in \u201Ca'\u201D. And even if I trash the ignore statement and simply write \u201Csub
    a' b by b\u201D, the name is missing on the panel. Sorry, that I partly miss the
    correct terms.\r\n\r\nI think, it is more a bug than a feature. At least I get
    no idea, why it could be intended."

    You could generate for instance an OpenType font with FLS, export the features
    file in OTM, subsequently do some syntax editing to support the latest AFDKO and
    use the new features file to generate new GSUB (and/or GPOS features). The same
    features file can be used then for compiling GSUB tables for other OT fonts (which
    use the same character naming convention, of course).\r\n"
