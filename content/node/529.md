body: Hello, a while ago I posted a typeface for critique in the display section,
  it was named Bastian Gothic Condensed http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/868.html?1015663740
  <BR> <BR>Anyway, I&#39;ve been asked to display this typeface at a museum during
  an exhibition &#40;strange indeed&#41;along with an illustration and I decided to
  rename the typeface... I thought it looked sort of political in a 30&#39;s kind
  of way, communist or nazist/facist typeface, and I worked from that. <BR> <BR>This
  is what I have got currently &#40;I&#39;m still working on it, this is just the
  illustration and the name of the typeface as you can see&#41;, and I&#39;m wondering
  if I might get away spelling &#34;politikal&#34; like that, not entirely correct,
  but then there&#39;s a connection with the &#34;party symbol&#34; and the typeface
  name... even though politikat sounds strange <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1254.gif"
  ALT="politikal"> <BR> <BR>Any suggestions/criticism welcome, also on the illustration.
  I was going for the look of russian propaganda posters.

    things I don&#39;t quite get, the K seems odd, and the @ after the type is a bit

    <BR> <BR>My personal opinion is that a little cyrillic influence goes a long way.
    For instance, is the backwards &#34;K&#34; necessary? The font already looks very
    soviet. <BR> <BR>The problem for me in using the portrait is that it doesn&#39;t
    really look like Russian propaganda art. It looks like a photo that someone hit
    with Adobe Streamline. <BR> <BR>One thing the Constructivists did &#40;Klutsis
    and El Lissitsky come to mind right now&#41; was add design elements to photographs.
    That might be another angle -- have an illustrated background with the typography,
    but smack a B&amp;W photo -- the granier the better -- in place of the illustration.

    it was a last minute design decision &#40;which indeed might be changed&#41; because
    I wanted to have the cyrillic influence more apparent. It&#39;s not in the original
    typeface though, so it might seem odd.  <BR> <BR>As for the @, I wanted to have
    a connection to the flag, I thought of the @ symbol as the the &#34;party symbol&#34;...
    Like a swastika or the hammer &amp; the I don&#39;t know what the other is called...
    cutter? &#40;erm...&#41;I can agree that it&#39;s a bit over the top though, I
    might remove it. <BR> <BR>This was in fact semi traced from a photograph,  <BR>even
    though I didn&#39;t use streamline... &#40;can&#39;t trust that damn program...&#41;
    And I was after this look: <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1256.jpg"
    ALT="soviet"> <BR> <BR>There&#39;s slightly more shading to it, something that
    the above miss, but still, I think it&#39;s fairly decent.  <BR> <BR>One thing
    I see in the original portrait is that it&#39;s a bit more &#34;angular&#34; or
    choppy if you like. As for the use of a b&amp;w photo with high grain, yes, that
    would be nice, but it would kill my computer.  <BR> <BR>This is going to be printed
    at a huge size, about 2,5 - 3 meters wide &#40;and then there&#39;s the typeface
    below...&#41;, so anything but native illustrator curves are out of the game.
    <BR> <BR>Also, the type will be applied &#40;where there&#39;s alot of white space&#41;
    if it doesn&#39;t look cluttered, with mock up revolutionary political messages.
    Sort of like the soviet poster. <BR> <BR>One thing I&#39;ve noticed in most russian
    propaganda is the strong diagonals and 45 degree rotated text... I&#39;ll try
    that. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">

    a commitment to the Volk, and a racially &#34;pure&#34; Germany. He later gained
    leadership and changed the name of the party to the National Socialist German
    Workers&#39; Party, called for short, the Nazi Party &#40;or NSDAP. Maybe not

    <BR> <BR>&#34;Why the German script disappeared: After the <BR>turn of the century,

    As German society became more <BR>cosmopolitan, the national style of writing

  body: I attended that discussion in Leipzig, and will repeat my comments here, because
    I feel it is very important. <BR> <BR>It is wrong to let some pathological subculture
    or political movement appropriate a style of lettering that developed over centuries.
    The fact that Christian Death or Storm Front choose to enlist someone else&#39;s
    hard work &#40;e,g. a type design&#41; in the service of their own cause or beliefs
    should not soil the type itself, especially when the original designer died over
    a century ago!! Yvonne Schwemer-Scheddin&#39;s analysis as it appeared in the
    Bain/Shaw monograph, while a good compendium of illustrations, is in my opinion
    way off. Those designs should be celebrated and judged on their aesthetic and
    technical merit and not on what some 25-year-old bigot in an Oi band still living
    with his parents does with them. The increasingly neurotic impulse to suppress
    &#34;dangerous ideas&#34; so common in Germany today serves only to give those
    ideas more power. <BR> <BR>People speak of a &#34;Nazi aesthetic.&#34; THERE IS
    NO NAZI AESTHETIC. They plundered the aesthetic of the times just the same as
    they plundered Jewish property. To insist any differently is to give them credit
    they never deserved. <BR> <BR>There are, however, a number of &#34;Constructivist&#34;-looking
    textura-grotesk hybrids that were inspired heavily by the aesthetics of the early
    Nazi and pre-Nazi era, mainly Tannenberg and Element, and whose advertisements
    leveraged the prevailing Nazi sentiment of the times, appropriately labeled &#34;Schaftstiefelgrotesk.&#34;
    They are used today mainly for satirical purposes when someone wants to paint
    someone else as a Nazi &#40;enter Godwin&#39;s Law.&#41; And yet, all the anti-Nazi
    paranoia in Europe isn&#39;t enough to stop the EU giving money to The Amazing
    Exploding Palestinians in their effort to once again &#34;protect&#34; the world
    from <I>der ewige Jude</I>. Full circle in just sixty years. <BR> <BR>You can
    get the black weight of Tannenberg from Dieter Steffmann&#39;s site www.steffmann.de
    for free, and you can buy the lighter and bold weights from www.fraktur.com, Delbanco
    Frakturschriften. Again, I presume any use would be for sharply critical/satirical
    purposes. <BR> <BR>The best selection of blackletters available in one place is
    Dipl.-Ing. Gerhard Helzel&#39;s site www.romana-hamburg.de. In addition to his
    impressively cerebral list of hobbies &#40;Latin, oil painting, electrical engineering,
    and writing erotic novellas&#41; he offers over 300 digitized blackletters for
    sale, many unavailable elsewhere, with lots of ligatures and alternates including
    the important but oft-forgotten half-r. He puts a ch ligature in the c slot, so
    have your FontLab handy if you choose to buy. <BR> <BR>Another source is FVL GbR,
    www.fraktur.de, from whom I recently bought the narrow alternates from Koch&#39;s
    Wilhelm Klingspor-Schrift and a few others. The exact relationships between these
    companies and the large foundries like Linotype and Berthold are not always clear,
    but from conversations that I&#39;ve had with the one larger foundry, they&#39;re
    not that interested in reviving more old blackletters, because they simply don&#39;t
    sell enough to justify the investment required to digitize them, so these companies
    are generally not a concern to them, and in some cases they have reached an understanding.
    I hope to get a better handle on just who is and who isn&#39;t considered a pirate
    in these four cases, since there are some overlaps with commercial fonts on the
    glyph level if not on the font level. <BR> <BR>On my own site, I have a growing
    directory of commercial blackletter designs offered by several foundries, large
    and small. Visit <BR> <BR>http://eccentrifuge.com/Fonts/blackletter.html <BR>
    <BR>The page will get a formatting upgrade in the next month or so. Anyone here
    with a commercial blackletter design who wants to be listed can mail me at john@eccentrifuge.com.
    The point of the site is to introduce font consumers to the lesser-known blackletter
    designs out there. Opinions are appreciated. <BR> <BR>Finally, in regard to your
    design, my impression is that you disapprove of &#40;pardon my ignorance&#41;
    whatever group it is that you&#39;re depicting. If that&#39;s your intent, than
    the execution is flawless.

    It was actually Bismarck who said that, one war prior. &#34;Deutsche B&uuml;cher
    in Antiquaschriften lese ich nicht,&#34; I believe is how it went. The Nazis killed
    blackletter. If we&#39;re to be consistent, we should not associate Nazis with
    blackletter but rather with its absence. More blackletter, please. '
