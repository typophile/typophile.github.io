  font of this sample is custom made: Is my opinion right? If so does anybody know
  a similar font? I have found e.g. the \xBBCrillee Extra Bold Italic\xAB or the \xBBSerpentine\xAB.
  But I find the K is rather distinctive ...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schriftmuster.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    was happy with the Crillee-suggestion from there. See for yourself (the suggested

  body: Yes, it is a screen capture of an old b/w-movie. And I have bought the Crillee
    to design the DVD-Cover. Thank you for your help!
