body: Whilst the Quick Brown Fox... is good for testing individual glyphs. What do
  people use to extensively test their font&#39;s with, beyond the scope of a single
  pangram sentence, say with a large body of text? Whilst I could cut &#39;n&#39;
  paste any old text, could  anyone recommend a specific string to check a newly created
  font?

    in posting this is to show that the coverage of kern pairs by English words is
    in fact quite spotty--even just counting lc pairs, you&#39;re missing almost a
    fifth of the possible combinations. Once you add in uppercase, you get four times
    the number of digraphs that need coverage, and the rising popularity of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">CamelCase</a>
    makes it even more likely to actually run into those. <BR> <BR>So yeah, I&#39;m
    going to make sure to cover all possible digraphs when I actually get around to

    q is used for the &#39;ch&#39; sound. This is used to input Chinese on computers,
    and also is the PRC preferred way to transliterate Chinese. FYI, qi &#40;pronounced
    chee&#41; means air, atmosphere, or spirit, and is also the term for the mysterious
    energy that is supposed to flow through the body and the landscape. It is a key
    term in both acupuncture and fung shui, as well as being part of many, many Chinese
    words.

    the goals for the resulting text? Obviously, containing all digraphs is the most

    real distributions?
