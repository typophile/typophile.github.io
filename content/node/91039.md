  copy in a combination with Adobe Garamond Pro (semibold) for headlines?  \r\n\r\nI
  work with graphic design at one of the oldest swedish universities and recently
  the university has updated its graphic profile with the help from a local ad agency.
  This new type combination \u2013 it's actually just been reversed, Frutiger was
  used for display before \u2013 is supposed to be used in all communication material
  (ads, posters, brochures, magazines etc). There is nothing wrong with Frutiger but
  in longer texts and in smaller measures \u2013 it's just really hard to read even
  if the leading is spacious. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Don't feel bad. For several years my college had a designer infatuated with
    Century Gothic, and as a result it was used for body copy, often in ridiculously
    small sizes on all materials.\r\n\r\nThen someone realized that all these things
    we were paying to have printed would be much more effective if people could actually
    read them.\r\n\r\nI hope it doesn't take your school as long to learn."

  body: I thought that I had read that <strong>Matthew Butterick</strong> sees Frutiger
    as a possible body text choice - granted for legal documents only - but even so...
    is it really that bad? What would you suggest in its place?

  body: "Thanks for the input!\r\n\r\nIf not Frutiger, what else? Yes, Neue Frutiger
    might be a choice, since it has a Book weight. But then I'm not sure since I traditionally
    prefer serifs in body (that is in extended texts). \r\n\r\nI feel that this whole
    updating process and the result of it regarding Frutiger is about being trendy
    and following the recommendations from and ad agency. The given explanation has
    been \"as long as you can read it\", \" it's not that bad\" and \"our own scientists
    says so\" (and who can argue with them?) rather than looking at why Frutiger is
    the best choice from a typographic and legible point of view. Of course you can
    read it, but again, is it the best choice in the long run? \r\n\r\nTalking about
    trends, maybe they should have replaced the fonts with something entirely new,
    like something Scandinavian or even Swedish? Berling Nova is a personal favorite.
    And when it's time for a new update of the graphic profile, I promise, I will
    be even more prepared.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the comments =)"

  body: With the risk of sounding at odds with the general opinions expressed here,
    I think that Frutiger can work nicely in long text settings - say, in a magazine
    environment. Nonetheless, What Lovisa Jones says about the look of the roman weight
    is true - it can be too dense on the page (same goes for Gill Sans, in my opinion).
    One alternative could be using Frutiger Light, rightly spaced and leaded, at 9
    or 10 points, if the printer's black is a real black. The pairing with Adobe Garamond
    also looks interesting to me.

  body: Keep in mind that many university publications are relatively short (posters,
    brochures, etc). There are some exceptions, of course, such as magazines and course
    catalogs, but a lot of pieces are fairly small.

    proportions, it is also closer to to Meriden's original metal proportions. The
    structure is also in general close to Frutiger, although the italic in Frutiger
    (Sans) should really have changed structure the same way that Meriden does. Or
    at least closer to that.\r\n\r\nBut they do have a quite different feel, despite
    a somewhat similar structure and system of proportion."
