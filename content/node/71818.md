  family on a budget.\r\n\r\nThe typefaces I have looked into are:\r\n\r\n- Farnham\r\n-
  Whitman\r\n- Chaparral\r\n- PF Centro Serif\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest an ALTERNATIVE
  typeface family (of similar nature to the above listed) that is available in a PRO
  version (of at least 4-5 fonts including regular, bold, italic and small caps) that
  sells for under $50?\r\n\r\nThis also may not be possible... but one must hope.\r\n\r\nT

    by [[Underware]] is one of the few text faces out there that also happens to be
    an amazing display face. All those details come to life at big sizes, and the
    bold is really playful \u2014 almost childish. It\u2019s less than $50 per font."

    Nasos was talking about Adobe Creative Suite (Indesign, Illustrator, Photoshop
    ++) and the bundled fonts that come with it. Some of them are very good, but might
    not be the thing to set your magazine apart since everybody else have them. The
    same goes for Calluna. I personally think the treatment of fonts matters even
    more than the fonts themselves, but that\u2019s me."

    treatment of fonts matters even more than...\")\r\n\r\nYes. That's just it. But,
    I was unaware that ANY fonts bundled with software came with expert features such
    as small caps, old style figures etc.\r\n\r\nI don't mind using one of these \"bundled\"
    fonts (and letting the \"treatement\" uphold a strong design) but need to know
    which ones are bundled. (yes... I can \"google\" it... I suppose...)\r\n\r\nIn
    response, I do believe I am still in a position to ASK for quality with an empty
    wallet. (I am after all DONATING my own design skills \u2013 of high quality \u2013
    to the cause I am working for). That being said, I PREFER to purchase the typefaces
    I use for this project.\r\n\r\nTHANKS AGAIN!\r\n\r\nJaz"

    family is $59 for seven fonts.\r\nIt has no OpenType features, but the figures
    are proportional old style.\r\nIf you use the Light weight for text, then you
    can use the Regular for small caps.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you don't have small caps
    in a font, it is possible to make them by using the \"fake\" small cap feature
    in InDesign, and adding a minute stroke value, plus a tad extra tracking (and
    maybe even a bit of horizontal scaling). I used to do that all the time in the
    days when the only digital fonts with small caps were Adobe Garamond and Scala.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think a font your looking for at under 50 bucks is unrealistic. You could
    have a look though at the Photina Expert Volume over at Fonts.com, which sells
    for only \u20AC 46,- (without tax). This has oldstyle figeres and fractions and
    smallcaps, but no lining figures. And they are all in seperate fonts, no Open
    Type. You might find some inexpensive fonts at http://www.fontmarketplace.com
    but they usually don't have the pro features you are looking for. You can get
    the Dante family + smallcaps for under 25 dollar. \r\n\r\nYou could try contacting
    Sumner Stone, he has use based licensing for several of his typefaces like Cycles
    and Magma. This might be a priceworthy option.\r\n\r\nYou could also see this
    as an investment that will pay back in the long run and buy something you could
    use over a long stretch of time."
