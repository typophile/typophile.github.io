  for a logo idea when I stumbled upon this website. It looks really interesting and
  I look forward to talking to fellow designers and lovers of our work!\r\n\r\nI recently
  switched positions from photo editor to a junior Creative Designer building and
  redesigning web portals across western Canada for a company called Golden West.
  Hopefully I will be able to fill the position!\r\n\r\nLook forward to conversing
  with everyone!\r\n\r\nChristopher J. Martens"
