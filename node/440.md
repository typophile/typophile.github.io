  that  <BR>look like letterpress cuts, or rubberstamps &#40;relatively thick  <BR>line
  art&#41;. Two examples of what I&#39;m talking about are: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.ing.com"
  target="_blank">http://www.ing.com</a> <BR><a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com"
  target="_blank">http://www.brooksbrothers.com</a> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen the cuts
  at Briar Press, similar, but are there other  <BR>sources for this kind of thing,
  pref. online? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Randy'
