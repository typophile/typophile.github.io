body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nLooking for some suggestions for design for a logo for an indian
  clothing store. \r\nThe store sells traditional indian fabrics, both stiched and
  unstitched, many prints, clothing with extensive hand embroidery, and bead work,fancy
  bridal pieces that are custom stitched, custom crystal jewelery (fused between western
  and traditional indian designs). The store it self is currently under construction
  and will boast a boutique look, with wood floors, custom fixtures etc. The owners
  would like to use bits and pieces of color from the logo to compliment the interior.\r\n\r\ntarget:
  Indian decent women (18-40) who have minimal desire to travel abroad to shop for
  special events/ weddings. \r\n\r\nThe logo will be used in full color, and needs
  to read well from the signage. approx 6x 12 feet.\r\n\r\nany creative direction
  would help. type, color, logo ideas etc.... \r\n\r\nThanks in advance guys!\r\n\r\nZed."

    to design anymore? Seems a bit lazy to provide a brief and ask everyone for input
    without first lifting a pencil of your own. Bring design concepts along with colors
    and typefaces options to the table and I'm sure you'll get some constructive feedback.\r\n\r\nI
    look forward to seeing what YOU come up with."

    mind? \r\n\r\nI have a few color schemes in mind that I will be posting here shortly,
    and once i get a few ideas should revert back with some design concepts as well.\r\n\r\n"
