  body: "Definitely custom. Most logotypes (logos made of words) are hand drawn. Note
    the two lowercase a's are different styles, and the different tones (fonts are
    all black and white (or color and non-color). My thought is that you could reasonably
    duplicate the logotype by just scanning in a pencil/ink drawing.\r\n\r\nFor info

    like it? I don't know the band, but if they are trying to promote anarchy and
    disorder, then it might be an effective logo. For a bank or law office it might
    suck."
