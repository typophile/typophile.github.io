  body: But why write that an OpenType Pro font doesnt support Swedish, Norwegian
    etc. It doesnt make sense in my humble opinion. And it makes things confusing
    when these two languages is supported even in A STD font on almost every other
    foundry.

  body: Hello! It's just the presentation which is a bit weird. The text for 'OpenType
    Pro' says "<cite>In addition</cite> to the characters supported in the 'Std' version,
    OpenType Pro fonts contain characters for the following 12 European languages
    ..." (So it includes the languages mentioned for 'Std'.)

    says: <cite><strong>In addition</strong> to the characters supported in the \"Std\"
    version</cite>.\r\nYou\u2019re right; it\u2019s a little bit confusing that they
    listed all the languages contained for \u2018Std\u2019 and \u2018Com\u2019 but
    chose a abbreviated notation for \u2018Pro\u2019."

  body: 'The not so good thing is that in some cases a Pro version contains some alternate
    characters not available in Com, while Com version contains certain language characters
    not available in Pro. So Pro is not always a subset and you need to buy both if
    you want all available characters for a specific typeface. I think Stempel Garamond
    is that case (for example). '

    format? Of course it is a choice of the manufacturerers, but for the average customer
    I think it will be somwhat confusing with three different formats. Especially
    when they differ between different foundries. Sometimes a Pro font is a Pro font,
    sometimes a Com font is what someone else describes as Pro.\r\n\r\nMany people
    still doesnt know what OpenType really is.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>is it really needed for another format?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, there is
    some logic to it: If you do business reports, internal communication etc. for
    an international company, a font with wide language support comes in handy \u2013
    and you possibly don\u2019t have an urgent need for sophisticated typographic
    features like old-style figures.\r\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re doing aesthetic
    book design or so, you don\u2019t wanna pay for all those Lithuanian and Swahili
    diacritics (that is, if you\u2019re not in Southeast African or the Baltic region,
    of course).\r\n\r\n<cite>Of course it is a choice of the manufacturerers</cite>\r\nIn
    the end, it\u2019s just marketing.\r\n\r\n[sorry, edited a typo]"

  body: "Linotype's OpenType COM fonts are only available in TTF flavour OpenType
    with some of them hinted to their XSF standard. The end user is quite possibly
    baffled now with the range of options under the OpenType banner and the lack of
    industry standardisation; it's now possible to buy OpenType Std, Pro, Com, Com
    XSF, Pro Plus, Premier Pro....It's also quite possible that a Std font from one
    source will contain just as many layouts, glyphs, features etc as a Pro font from
    another source. Or that a content rich font will not have any defining suffix
    at all and may suffer saleswise because of this.   \r\n "

  body: "Given the variable amount of glyphs that can be put into an OpenType font--both
    in language support and typographic features--it becomes necessary for foundries
    to settle on standards for their own product line. \r\nOf course, it's going to
    differ from foundry to foundry.\r\nI'm not publishing WGL4 fonts for the Corel
    crowd.\r\nSo some foundries heavy up on the features, others on the language support.\r\nSome
    combine many encodings in a single font, others offer the different language encodings
    separately.\r\n\r\nAdobe's Pro fonts group Latin, Cyrillic and Greek in one font
    at one price, but FontFont let you buy them separately at different prices. Some
    foundries/distributors only sell fonts in family packages, others sell them individually.\r\n\r\nThe
    upshot is that there's no use complaining about a lack of standardization -- these
    days, it pays to be an informed purchaser, and for the producer/seller, the variety
    of formats on the market expands the market, by offering purchase opportunities
    at many points on the demand curve.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: One can more or less agree with this. But it's just that some foundries/sellers
    make it sometimes quite difficult to be an informed purchaser.
