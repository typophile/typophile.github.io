    he was nominated for. The video was one of the most touching I&#39;ve seen in
    a very long time, the song is a killer and it would simply have been nice to see
    someone like Cash win something... anything... on a channel like MTV. Instead
    we get Justin Timberlake. Yeah... right. I hope now that Cash is dead, someone
    at MTV is kicking him- or herself in the bee-hind ;-&#41;. '

    the grain of what MTV usually stands for. I was utterly surprised to even see
    Cash nominated and thought it would have been neat if the old man snatched away
    the moon man from singers that grew out of drawing-board-designed boy bands. I&#39;m
    not that big a fan of Cash, but it would have been a great moment anyway. '

    <BR>Yeah I cought that, it was a re-play from the show they did right after she
    died. She was quite a spectacular women too. It was inspiring to see how much
    in love they were after soo many years. Something Johhny never failed to do was
    praise his wife and keep there relationship as fresh as the day they met. <BR>
