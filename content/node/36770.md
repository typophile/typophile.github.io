  I don't want to change the logo. Any ideas of some good fonts that go well with
  Copperplate.

  body: "Hi Patricia. What kind of wine is it? Is it for wealthy retirees or young
    hipsters? Where does it come from? What sort of image does the company want to
    convey? \r\n\r\nThese are all questions that you should ask when designing the
    label. We can help you find something that won't clash with Copperplate, but the
    field is far too broad. These more important questions come first. "

  body: "Oh so many questions.\r\n\r\nWe want to update our look. Currently the wine
    sells mostly on premise (in restaurants). We are improving the juice as well as
    the packaging. The competition is Bella Sera , cavit\r\n\r\nClassic and contemporary
    not trendy or humorous. \r\n\r\nThis is italian wine many varietals each one will
    have different color accents to stand apart from the others. I want to maintain
    copperplate as the product brand font.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help"

    for large type, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/stone_print/\">Stone
    Print</a> for smaller\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Penumbra\">Penumbra</a>
    for a sans or flare serif variation\r\n\r\nSomething from the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=engravers%20creative%20alliance%20-purchase\">Engravers
    series</a>  to maintain the classic flavor\r\n\r\nTo me, the words \"classic\"
    and \"contemporary\" are almost polar. Can you further define them?"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is, that it isn't so traditional that it looks like
    it's from a different time. I want it contemporary and placed in this century.
    Rather than coping the old. I want to reinventing it in a new fresh way.\r\n\r\nExamples
    that I like: \r\n\r\nwww.legaris.es/LEGARIS/vinos_b.html\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nwww.cusumano.it/en/vini/mono_02.php"

    so I will try out several. I guess as I get gong I will try the out and use the
    styles that fit the layout.\r\n\r\nI feel like a cheater. I wouldn't have come
    up with these fonts on my own!"

    I don\u2019t want to change the logo.\r\nCopperplate Gothic = suspicious\r\nI
    would have no (big) trust in that wine, i'm only speaking as a (red wine, european)
    consumer. From your list; Sackers Gothic is better (but needs better spacing),
