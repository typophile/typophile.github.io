  body: hmm, can&#39;t realy help you with a reproduction of the specimen book, but,
    as far as i&#39;m aware, both <a href="http://www.linotype.com/12871/sabonbold-font.html"
    target=_top>sabon</a> and <a href="http://www.linotype.com/1500/stempelgaramond-family.html"
    target=_top>stempel garamond</a> are based on the 1592 specimen sheet issued by
    the Egenolff-Berner foundry.

  body: 'Dear Geraint: <BR> <BR>Thank you for your reply. However, I have both Stempel
    Garamond and Sabon, and I think neither of them are goof renditions. Sabon is
    quite different, really. Stempel Garamond seems to me to have a very rigid and
    &#39;Teutonic&#39; manner about it which I find totally allien to the original
    design. In that respect, and even if it is too smooth, I prefer Slimbach&#39;s
    version.  <BR> <BR>What I am looking for is a very high resolution photo of the
    Berner original print, because I want to be able to study the very small characters
    &#40;Galliard, Non Pareil, and even the slighly bigger ones&#41;.  <BR> <BR>In
    any case, I&#39;d like to know if the book of which I give samples below is Garamond
    or not. They will look huge, but I did try to make them small; the text size is
    about 10 points.  <BR> <BR>Here they are: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/50264.jpg"

    Reproductions of Fifteen Type Specimen Sheets Issued Between the Sixteenth and
    Eighteenth Centuries, John Dreyfus, ed. <BR> <BR>abebooks.com has it from about
    $65 to about 160. Of course, if you don&#39;t already have Carter&#39;s &#34;A

    scan of the Dreyfus reproduction, 200dpi versions are at <a href="http://levien.com/type/berner/">levien.com/berner</a>,
    I can get 1200 dpi scans to you on request. Let me know.'

  body: 'Thanks all: <BR> <BR>The Dreyfus book tends to be expensive - most bookshops
    have it, but they usually don&#39;t state what they are selling. So I gather there
    are two volumes, one with text and another with the specimen sheets. I&#39;ll
    investigate. <BR> <BR>DEar Ralph: Your links were very informative. Of course
    you if you are so kind as to give yourself the trouble of sending a high resolution
    scan I would very much like to have it. So, I gladly accept your offer. <BR> <BR>Best
    regards, <BR> <BR>Rodrigo de S'
