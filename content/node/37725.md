  body: It's Requiem, but it's probably supposed to be Trajan. I used to work for
    a company that published Max Lucado's books, and official policy was that his
    name would always be set in Trajan. But that was some three years ago, and corporate
    policy changes pretty quickly.

  body: I guess they thought the name Requiem was more appropriate for a minister.
