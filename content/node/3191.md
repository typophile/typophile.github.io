  body: Very cool. I agree with hhp, and would add the &#34;s&#34; to the list. It
    needs some more of that poetry of odds you are playing with.

  body: 'Excellent work. I really enjoy seeing type design that moves into the blacklettering
    category while still retaining the  <BR>useablity / legibility of contemporary
    letterforms. I tried this a while back with one of my own design, which was never
    completed. I think I will now have to pick it up where it was left off. Thanks
    for the inspiration. '

  body: Very impressive. Does the o need to be more angular and narrower for harmony
    with the rest?

  body: The &#34;k&#34; is not black letter at all, as well as the &#34;f&#34; and
    the top serifs of the ascenders. I like the texture, only the &#34;s&#34; stands
    out too much in it. <BR>
