    Louize, a new revival by Matthieu Cortat of the \u2018Augustaux\u2019 designed
    by Louis Perrin between 1846 and 1855. \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nonpareille/louize/\r\nIf
    G and some other letters were edited it would be possible to produce a passable
    facsimile of the French book of 1867. The Romanas and Devinnes have the same source
    but they are transformed versions that do not fit very well.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Jan, great find. First class discussion. Also at http://typophile.com/node/7596\r\nI
    wonder what happened to the Perrin font being developed by J. Knox in December
    2004 as Marquet. \r\nI Googled \"fonts Marquet\" and found links to a heavy script
    font.\r\nI did some further research. French Old Style is the English name for
    a style of font designed by Th\xE9ophile Beaudoire in 1858. The upper case is
    derived from Louis Perrin's Lyon Capitals. The European name, sometimes also used
    in English, is Elzevir. Not a lot of difference with Marquet.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I looked more closely at the 1867 specimen and have a couple of observations.\r\nThe
    text -- perhaps at 20 point or thereabouts --  is extremely thin. The sample of
    French Old Style I posted -- 18 point body type -- has generally matchs the 1867
    titling text,  but is thicker. The Perrin font being developed by J. Knox is not
    as close to the letterforms -- note for example the leg on the R -- and is also
    thicker. His Marquet Titling is moderately thinner but still too heavy for a match.
    French Old Style No. 2 as sold by ATF in 1900 -- and probably similar to versions
    sold by foundries in Europe and America for many years before then --  seems bang
    on at 20 point for the weight and letter width, but like Perrin/Marquette has
    the wrong leg on R\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FrenchOSNo2p@ATF1900_5314.jpg]\r\nWe
    are a long ways from having a perfect digital match to the spindly letters in
    the book title.\r\nUnfortunately, demand for fonts that accurately recreate 19th
    century books is probably too low to justify making most of these fonts.\r\nDon"

  body: "Geoff, you wrote: \"<strong>i bet this is an easy one...</strong>\". Honestly,
    you have no idea how easy it was...n't.    :-)\r\n\r\nWhat I found is that the
    font being used is shown in several specimens from 1867 through 1882, all French.
    I could not find it in anything before 1867, but then it's very likely I don't
    have all the specimens available.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, although it is classified
    and shown with all the Elzeviriennes, it is never given a name, only a number.
    It is a titling face, thus has no lowercase. I halfway expected to find it in
    the 1907 BB&S book, but it is not there.\r\n\r\nThere is no digital equivalent
    to be found, at least by me. Someone ought to do a public service and digitize
    it for us; it's a nice face although it could use a little updating."

    for public service in digitizing it, I have found from experience that to do an
    adequate job on a text face like this is far more demanding than a display font.
    Unfortunately, life is all too short. The only way I would consider it is a commission
    from a publisher.\r\nBTW there are a few excellent digitizations of 19th century
    text fonts. For example Ronaldson from Rebecca Alaccari at Canada Type, and Scotch
    Roman by Nick Shinn.\r\nDon "

  body: "Don, you wrote: <blockquote>As for public service in digitizing it, I have
    found from experience that to do an adequate job on a text face like this is far

    entirely, but this isn't a text face; it is a titling face so wouldn't take nearly
    as much planning for someone to do.\r\n\r\nOK, enough of that. The numbers I mentioned
    previously are merely serial, as in a list of fonts of general styles in different
    books. Nothing specific which would identify a type such as in the early years
    of American foundries.\r\n\r\nHere is the info you requested, all French specimens
    except for the final one:\r\nBadoureau, 1875, printer; categorized with other
    Elz\xE9viriennes, shows as 16 through 72 point, no numbering.\r\n\r\nMangin, 1867,
    printer; uncategorized, serially numbered as #46, shows only 18 point, says \"8
    alphabets\" which I take to mean point sizes.\r\n\r\nBerthier, 1882, printer/foundry;
    categorized as Initiales Elz\xE9viriennes, used on title pages, also shows eight
    sizes, numbered 750 through 757.\r\n\r\nMonnoyer, 1889, printer; categorized as
    Initiales Elz\xE9viriennes, shows two series: 6 through 10 point, and 7 through
    56 point. The sizes 7 through 10 in the latter series are a distinct cut from
    the larger sizes but show the /R characteristic. The /G and the long tail on the
    /Q don't show up until 12 point. No numbering, just point sizes.\r\n\r\nB\xE9cus,
    undated, printer; has an Elz\xE9vir titling series but it is not the same face
    as the one we seek.\r\n\r\nTurlot, undated, c.1885, foundry; categorized as Initiales
    Elz\xE9viriennes, used in one line on title page, as the initial cap on all pages,
    also shows point sizes 9 through 48 only, no numbering. This specimen in the smaller
    sizes has an /R more like the larger sizes. It does not show the /G in the smaller
    sizes.\r\n\r\nAnd finally...\r\nATF, 1898, foundry; a showing of Newspaper Headings
    #118, 6L, which appears to be the same face although not enough characters are
    shown to do more than speculate. This face does not appear in the ATF 1897. Given
    that this was a newspaper face, it is highly unlikely that a specimen of the full
    font exists today except hidden away in some collection. The only other possibility
    is if an American foundry prior to ATF picked up the design and renamed it as
    something we haven't discovered yet.\r\n"

  body: "Excellent research George. Goes straight into my \"dig further\" file.\r\nMinor
    point, this design was popular for body text as well as display.\r\nIt could be
    done as only a titling face, but that would not do it justice.\r\nThe display
    sizes are extremely spindly, the text ones not as much but still very light compared
    to text faces developed in the last 120 years, starting perhaps with Century Old
    Style. In America text faces like French Old Style were purged from the printer's
    catalogs around 1900 as lacking assertiveness. If memory serves me correctly,
    they persisted longer in European foundries. \r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "I regret that the typeface was never completed to a standard that I felt
    comfortable releasing for sale. Over the years, I worked on it piecemeal and many
    versions accumulated. It got so I couldn't tell my versions apart. Also, the glyphs
    proliferated as I added IPA symbols, various accents, etc. that were in some versions
    but not others... Perhaps I might look at my work again and see if I can't figure
    out how to finish it an release it on MyFonts as I had intended.\r\n\r\nWhen working
    on the typeface, I had much assistance from Mr. Hrant Papazian. Is he still around
    these parts? I consider it a great disservice to him that I never finished my
    work, after all the work he and others contributed. Hrant scanned some wonderful
    samples from Ovink which I referred to extensively, and which he may still have
    on his website.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can be of any assistance regarding this
    typeface.\r\n\r\nJ.P. Knox"

  body: "Thanks J.P. for the update on Marquet. I checked the pdfs in http://typophile.com/node/54015
    and find that Marquet really catches a light esthetic. It's your decision as to
    whether or not to finalize the project. About all I can suggest is that a quest
    for perfection in design means that there will always be new aspects that deserve
    refinement. I believe that at some point it's best to set these issues aside,
    declare victory and present a project as a best effort. My observation of many
    of the fonts that I like is that they could benefit from re-editing and revision,
    but this does not affect their primary role as a design that users find satisfying
    and are prepare to to ignore deficiencies that the designer may perceive.\r\nDon"
