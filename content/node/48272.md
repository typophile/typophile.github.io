  don't think \"Reunion\" is normally arced and inflated from the top like that. it
  was probably just an effect someone applied to the letters in illustrator. I ran
  these through What The Font on myfonts.com trying to identify the letterforms, but
  i came up empty handed.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help guys!"
