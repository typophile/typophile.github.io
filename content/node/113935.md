  Explorer?\r\n(Si, I'm lookin' at you, kiddo.)\r\n\r\nI've noticed that Data URLS
  are supported in IE 11 - or so my webfont test pages tell me.\r\n\r\n(If you're
  unfamiliar with them, data urls in a @font-face CSS declaration use base 64 encoding
  and look like this:\r\n@font-face{font-family:'backdrop';src:url(data:font/woff;charset=utf-8;base64,d09GRgABAAAAAAo.....}\r\n\r\nBut
  oddly, I've heard nothing about it via the grapevine. No blog posts mentioning it,
  no twitterin', nothin'. \r\n\r\nDid support start prior to IE 11 or is IE 11 the
  first version to do so? Are there any limitations like the size of the data? Is
  the format an issue - will TTF, OTF,  WOFF and EOT all work?\r\n\r\nAre there any
  support docs explaining it? (If so, they seem to be buried deep - I don't see Data
  URLS for fonts mentioned at all  in the usual places on the Microsoft Developer
  Network where you'd expect to find it.)\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated.\r\n\r\nrich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Rich,\r\n\r\nData uri for fonts is supported since IE9 when we introduced
    full support for @font-face rules. Some webfont providers serve fonts this way
    for a long time.\r\nThere is nothing special about data uri in regards to fonts.
    They are just data blobs and processed as regular externally downloaded file,
    it doesn't matter what format is actually inside it. There was a limitation of
    32k on data uri size in IE8, but in IE9 it was removed.\r\nIs this information
    helpful?\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"

    helpful. Thanks. \r\n\r\nTo the extent that I can, I like to write web font test
    pages that have everything necessary written into the page with no need for supporting
    CSS or JS files.\r\nSo embedding a font using a Data URI is indeed useful.\r\nIt's
    been available since IE9?  Wow - I'll bet a lot of developers have absolutely
    no idea that's the case and are feeding all versions of IE either an EOT, a WOFF,
    or a TTF file thinking they absolutely must do so.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nRich\r\n\r\n"
