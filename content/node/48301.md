  body: "You could easily create this using a small brush with soft edges and just
    write exactly what you want. Then use the Transform and Warp tools in Photoshop
    to straighten, etc.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I think it's available on Fonts.com (not
    sure of the name) or you may find something similar at dafonts.com.\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck."

  body: "Since two people thought there was something to match this I looked at every
    category on MyFonts that I thought would fit, but the most similar I could find
    were [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/chiller/|Chiller]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/turtlearts/paint/|Paint]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/okaycat/okay-paint/|OkayPaint]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/jaggy/|Jaggy]]
    -- none are matches. I still think that this is not a font, but is lettering drawn
    by hand.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
