  body: "To quote the FAQ:\r\n\r\nWhat about scripts the resemble casual handwriting?\r\nOoh,
    that\u2019s a tough one. You see, these are very easy and quite cheap to make,
    so there are a gazillion different handwritten fonts out there. So unless it\u2019s
    one of the better known handwritten fonts, the chances that we identify yours
    are quite slim. On the other hand, if you look around you\u2019ll most probably
    find an alternative that matches really closely."
