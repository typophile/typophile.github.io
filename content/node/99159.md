  and considering sans / serif pairs. So far I\u2019m looking at Skolar with Meta,
  the Museo family and Caecilla with Gibson. Looking for any thoughts on these, or
  alternative suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks and happy hols."

  body: "I don't know if Ernestine would work for body text in a textbook... And I
    wouldn't use a sans for a textbook either. So maybe find a serif font for the
    body that echoes something from Ernestine (used for headings); I think it would
    have to have a rather neutral character (especially if it's a slab too).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yes, I see that - but isn\u2019t Ernestine a slab? If not, why not? If so,
    why would Ernestine not work as body text but Caecilla works fine? \r\n\r\nAnyway,
    the plan is to use sans for headings and inline boxes and so on, then main body
    as a slab or serif.\r\n\r\nThanks for your thoughts hrant."

  body: "Caecilla isn't as wide and most of all is more neutral. But personally I'm
    not a fan of it for long text either (and at least Ernestine's slabs are angled,
    so more comfortable).\r\n\r\nBut I wouldn't discount a \"gentle slab\" like Ernestine
    for headings.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
