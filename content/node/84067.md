  he's working on and has done a mock-up of this from a typeface he saw online, unfortunately
  the typeface he was using is not named, so I was wondering if anyone here knew what
  the typeface is called so we can buy it and finalise the logo.\r\n\r\nYou can see
  a screenshot here: http://www.birchstudio.co.uk/img/luke.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJames\r\n\r\n"

    high-waisted style does not look like any serif I can think of, so I wonder if
    some heavy customization has been used on a narrow serif like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/pall-mall-rr/\">Pall
    Mall</a>, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Mike. The image is of the font he is planning to use. He found it
    on a website somewhere and managed to make a few screenshots and mockup how his
    logo might look.\r\n\r\nI'll look into Pall Mall and University and see if some
    customisation is the key. Thanks."
