  that makes up the letters? Sorry if that wasn't a very good description and the
  only example I can find is off this SKY HD ad. I guess its kinda like a neon sign
  or like if you made words up by roughly stitching them.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

  body: "Fig Script could work perfectly, cheers!\r\n\r\nOh, one thing though, as
    the project is for a charity and the budget is tight, are there any which are
    free?\r\n\r\nSorry to keep coming back with questions but I don't quite know what
    to call this kind of font so have been having problems searching for one!\r\n\r\nThanks
    again"

  body: "Well, we had this question over at the (temporarily closed) Dafont-forum.
    And site-mod Fred also recommended Expletive Script as the basis of the font.
    Regular Member Koeiekat doubted it because of the difference in the l/c y and
    mailed either the TV station or Jonathan Barnbrook directly. Result: Custom typeface,
    exclusive design for sky; basis-font: expletive script. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    I can not verify this with an actual link to proof."
