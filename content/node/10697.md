body: This typeface is based on the notion of suggestion vs. statement, and testing
  the boundaries of legibility and practicality.  The goal is to achieve a subtle,
  elusive quality, while remaining somewhat comprehensible.   <BR>I&#39;m also intrigued
  by the eye&#39;s automatic ability to connect un-connected marks, for example, lines
  to dots, etc.   <BR>I still have some unresolved issues with line variance, and
  possibly spacing, both of which can be fixed. <BR> <BR>I appreciate any and all
  feedback offered.   Bring it. <BR> <BR>Merci. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7431.gif"

  body: I love the  whole idea behind the typeface and how you came up with  it.  Very
    thoughtful.  I think it&#39;s great that it ties into your clay work.  Can&#39;t
    wait to see the revised version. <BR>jori

  body: cara <BR>one thing i noticed is that some of the uppercase glyphs look more
    &#34;scripty&#34; than others; specifically the A, D, E, and L. you might want
    to unify the attitude of the set overall a bit more. also on the lowercase, why
    are the m, q, and r uppercase forms?  <BR> <BR>keep on truckin, and post those
    words, girl!
