    Olsen.\r\n\r\nIsn't that a bit condescending, Stephen? Couldn't they all be influenced
    by ever-present Danish ideas of lettering and design? It isn't as if Storm doesn't
    have a few successful typefaces under her belt\u2026"

  body: I didn't mean to condescend. There is nothing wrong with influences and I
    think she picked some good ones.
