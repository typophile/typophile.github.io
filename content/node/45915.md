  body: "Nice. Not a perfect match, but definitely close.\r\n\r\nThe most info I found
    about Placard was that \"the Placard Condensed font family is based on drawings
    received from Germany\" (from [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=205300|its
    page on fonts.com]]).\r\nIf anyone has any more info on the face, I'd be curious
    to hear it."
