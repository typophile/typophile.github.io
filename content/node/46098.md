body: 'Anyone know of some sources to purchase some [[wood type]]. Specifically, I''m
  looking for a set of mismatched numerals. I don''t want to use it for printing,
  so don''t want to nor need the guilt of splitting up siblings from a full case.
  A place that just sells some orphaned letterforms would be ideal. '

  body: aluminum - did you ask at the Minnesota Center for Book Arts? I know they've
    been selling some unused metal sorts - they might have some wood for you too.

  body: You can try the Hamilton Wood Type Museum. It's pricey thought, but it is
    new. Sharon already pointed the obvious place.

    close and the goods are put up for sale. Just recently I heard of a Ludlow set-up
    being sold right here in St. Paul. But I was too late. It may take some snooping
    around to find these things. \r\n\r\npowers"
