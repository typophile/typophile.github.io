  place for imagery, I plan to use Nautical style imagery, nice black and white images
  of lighthouses, waves crashing against the rocks etc. \r\n\r\nAs part of the brand,
  I am working on the logo, I was wondering if somebody can help me with font ideas
  that would work well with this style of imagery, a font that has a gentle nod to
  the nautical side of things, yet strong enough to stand on its own. The style of
  imagery may change in the future, therefore, the font needs to have a timeless feel.\r\n\r\nI
  am currently working with Adobe Garamond Pro, but would love some more creative
  variations.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any help."

    \r\n\r\nNice serif faces like Garamond, Caslon, and Baskerville I think would
    work well in all caps. I also wonder how something like Didot or Bodoni would
    look. Maybe you could post some examples of what you've been doing.\r\n\r\nAnalisa"
