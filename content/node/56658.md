body: I need to redo this logo for a longtime client, and the original designer of
  it, to thwart them, converted all the text to outlines before handing over the vector
  versions of it. I need both the serif font for ElderSource and the sans serif for
  the text underneath (which is kind of like Century Gothic, but the letters aren't
  the same width). It could still be Century Gothic, but I just need to adjust the
  horizontal scale. Adobe Caslon Pro is the closest I can come to the serif font.
