  <BR> <BR>I wanted to move away from the old logo of the gallery. The gallery specializes
  in glicee prints by artists such as Coop, Shepard Fairey, Pizz, Clayton Brothers.
  <BR> <BR>So I wanted to exploit the eccentric nature of the art by using a circus-cum-western
  look to the logo. To seperate its identity from other galleries.  <BR> <BR>I would
  apply this logo to a very eccentric corporate identity. To reflect the art and its
  buyers. <BR> <BR>Sock it to me!

  body: I should have added that I have concerns about the addition to the H. I am
    unfamilar with the term. I felt it needed sealing somehow - to keep the eye moving
    past the OF to the W. <BR> <BR>Is not a final logo. So I am keen for feedback.

  body: hi gareth <BR>i like the look of it <BR> <BR>i think that the vertical of
    the H are too separate and it generates a too present space, about the prolonmgation
    on the H i suggest you to excercise a more fluid one like the K one. <BR> <BR>good

  body: The skewing of the logo gives it an uneasy look, as if it&#39;s falling or
    slipping away, but then it looks as if it&#39;s out of wack, so its form is expressive
    of the name. It has a tension in it, I almost expect it to do something. <BR>I
    can&#39;t offer any negative critique on the type itelf as I&#39;m just a hack
    graphic designer to begin with.
