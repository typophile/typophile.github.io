  the choice of typography that will be used for small (5pt) text (product description
  and list of ingredients and usual stuff ). \r\n\r\nLittle bit about design that
  might help narrow down the list of choices...\r\nwhole design will have *retro*
  (something like Penguin peppermints) feel. Main headline is set in Neutra and another
  one with Fayette.\r\n\r\nWhat i need is good Readability at such small sizes. (I'm
  must say I prefere san serif face, tho I'm open to suggestions).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nL.\r\n"

    (or better & more recently -- <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bell-centennial/">Bell
    Centennial</a>) was desgined for use in telephone books at tiny sizes. Not sure
    how compatible it will be with your overall design, but should prove to be readable.

    target=\"new\">Copperplate</a> style type was frequently used to set tiny \"boiler
    plate\" text generally seen at the bottom of contracts, warranties, etc.\r\n\r\nNow
    it may seem odd that small caps were used as such, but it was common practice
    up through the mid-1940s."

    wonder though... since that's the only font of that name I could locate (albeit

    that <em>is</em> what Luka is using? "

  body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI need similar recommendations.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a typeface
    for use with 5pt text on ice cream packages. The problem is, that it needs to
    support <strong>estonian, latvian, lithuanian, cyrillic, swedish and english</strong>.
    Actually cyrillic might be from a different typeface but other languages should
    look the same.\r\n\r\nCurrently i'm using an opentype version of Arial [ :( ]
    , because it's the only font i've found that has all the characters i need. Unfortunately,
    it's not very economical. \r\n\r\nMost of the packages are printed using Flexo
    technology, which means that dot gain is quite big.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n"
