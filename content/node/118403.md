body: "I have set kerning in my win type 1 font, and, wanted to use it in MS word.
  Weird is, kerning works just in some cases - just on basic characters. The problem
  is only in office - in all other programs like illustrator / indesign not. \r\n\r\n-
  screenshot - left - illustrator, right MS word 2007 (problem at \"\u0159e\" vs \"re\"
  )\r\n\r\nTryed \r\n- turn kerning in word on/off, \r\n- play with settings at fontlab
  options in kerning, \r\n- made openType feature \"kerning\" with kerning asist.
  \r\nnothing worked. seems like word ignoring all national characters kerning.. \r\n\r\nAnyone
  can help me? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I assume rcaron is referenced in r right kerning class. Did you compile before
    generating?

  body: "Type 1 fonts have no kerning classes, so you probably should expand the class
    kerning before generating the fonts (Tools \u2192 Kerning Assistance \u2192 Expand).\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I didn\u2019t know that Type 1 fonts were still supported by Word ;)"

  body: "Type 1 fonts can only have so many encoded glyphs, and to have rcaron in
    a Type 1 font would require an unusual encoding. That character is not in WinANSI
    (codepage 1252) or Adobe Standard Encoding. It is however in Windows 1250 (Central
    European). You may need to be sure you set that encoding before generating the
    font, see if that helps?\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that there is some sort of
    Windows or app-specific bug in this regard, related to assumptions about encoding.
    \ :(\r\n\r\nNote that Type 1 fonts will not even show up in modern DirectWrite
    apps, so it's kind of a dead end these days. I wouldn't build a new font in Type
    1 unless it was required by a customer for some odd reason."
