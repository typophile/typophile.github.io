body: "For my bachelor assignment I want to investigate which subtle variations within
  the established framework of letters causes which emotions.\r\n\r\nAs Spiekermann
  states in this interview [[http://news.gestalten.com/news/interview-erik-spiekermann-typography|in
  this interview]]:\r\n\"The skill in type design lies precisely in working within
  this 90 to 95 percent established framework. An a is an a. Once again, it's like
  music: you work with clearly defined notes, but an oboe A sounds different to a
  violin A.\"\r\n\r\nI am interested in how type designers integrate emotions and
  moods in a typeface within this established framework. Which arch, contrast in stroke
  or terminal endings in the letters shape represents which feelings or emotions.
  I am not looking for concrete facts, but concrete views. And I am planning to interview
  type designers. \r\n \r\nBut I need some literature. Does anyone know of any literature
  available that might help me with the subject? \r\n\r\nSome books I've already looked
  at\r\nThe Geometry of Type, Coles\r\nDesigning Type, Cheng\r\nThe New Typography,
  Tschichold\r\nTypography: when who how, Feierabend et. ak.\r\nHello I\u2019m Erik,
  Erler\r\nLettering & Type, Willen & Strals.\r\n\r\nAll help is welcome. Thanks!"
