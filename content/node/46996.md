  body: "Charlie, I did check my other books and still was unable to find an exact
    match for this Art Deco look. In addition to the ones I mentioned in my e-mail
    this morning, I just found another of Nick Curtis's freebies called [[http://www.dafont.com/platonick.font?nb_ppp=50&text=BEEKMAN+TOWER|Platonick]]
    that is about the closest yet that I have seen.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
