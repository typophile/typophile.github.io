  ID</strong>\r\nIt is certainly in the categories of: blackletter, gothic, textura.
  Used by both Robert Barker (London, early 1600s) and Wolfgang Hopyl (Paris, early
  1500s). Hopyl moved to France to do printing, but also did printing for England.
  So northwestern Europe is the geographic region where I have found samples of this
  type. 16th century or so.\r\n\r\n<strong>Example 1</strong>\r\nIt was common in
  early printing, but I'm having difficulty finding a modern, digital revival of this
  beautiful type. Perhaps the best example is of the first printing of the [[http://digitalcollections.lib.umanitoba.ca/islandora/object/uofm%3A7107/pages?page=9|King
  James Bible 1611]]. It was printed in London by Robert Barker, the son of Christopher
  Barker. The father (Christopher) started printing around 1569, so I'm assuming that
  the type pieces used were probably mid-1500s era equipment.\r\n\r\n<strong>Example
  2</strong>\r\nThe second example is type from the printer Wolfgang Hopyl. [[http://www.kb.nl/bladerboek/hopyl/browse/page_122v.html|This
  example]] is taken from 1500. There is a very common typeface called \"Manuskript
  Gotisch\" (or \"Manuskript Gothisch\") that was inspired by type used by Hopyl in
  1514, but <strong>this type is not Manuskript Gothisch</strong> and have included
  it in my sample (see attachment) for comparison purposes. \r\n"

    Alberto Mauricio, of Alter Littera, is apparently working on a modern revival
    of the typeface, but it seems to still be in development: http://www.alterlittera.com/al_htm/oldtype.htm\r\nThe
    typeface in the second sample looks similar, but on closer inspection, it seems
    to be a different typeface."
