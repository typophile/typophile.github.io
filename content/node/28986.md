  a part of my curriculum I have to create a futuristic visual environment. I have
  chosen to create/predict the future of fonts ; by which I mean which fonts will
  be popular for what purposes : serif or sans serif ? multiple weights of single
  fonts ? limited fonts ? decorative scripts and typefaces ?\r\n\r\nAlso looking at
  the transformation of fonts into visuals in billboards and advertisements and the
  changed use of fonts due to the reduction of viewing time people are willing to
  spare to read written material.\r\n\r\nWould love to hear your thoughts on the future
  you foresee...\r\n\r\nThank You !"

    exactly the future, look at the modern take on a Praxinoscope at the bottom of
    the post, could have a type use.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: 'Everyone knows that we''re stuck with Helvetica until the meteor hits, but
    as this is a theoretical exercise, maybe think about the directions technology
    is going. For example OpenType-like technology making organic, hand-rendered-like-quality,
    multi-colour/texture typography more accessible. Also look beyond flat rendering
    to what you can do on with a 3D printer. Also see where e-ink, and other low power,
    refreshable, large format, paper-like displays may take us.      '

    It might provide you with some insights.
