  body: "Most likely it is custom, but this is so typical of a whole genre that you
    should be able to find some that are very close at one of the freebie sites. This
    is the sort of font new designers seem to love, because there are so many of them.
    At Dafont.com see Terminator Real, Pulse Rifle, or Nu School Militia. With a little
    graphic tweaking, almost any of them would be very close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
