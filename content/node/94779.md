body: "Daphne was developed from a text written with a broad nib pen. A large number
  of calligraphic swashes are available for the strong and sharp-edged figures of
  Daphne Expert. They can be added to the letters via OpenType feature. Because many
  swashes fit on different characters, the combinations possible are endless. Alternate
  and complete swash characters offer additional options. An unique application for
  designers with a calligraphic instinct.\r\n\r\nwww.typemanufactur.com\r\nwww.facebook.com/typemanufactur\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/daphne1_5126.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/daphne2_4374.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/daphne3_5137.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/daphne4_6612.jpg]"

  body: Glyphs, whatever... Just looks to me Cyrillic set with this would look nice
    even if I do not understand any language using Cyrillic.
