  body: 'It does indeed look like News Gothic. If you&#39;re trying to match this
    sample exactly, however, beware that versions from different foundries may not
    all be quite the same. <BR> <BR>Compare for yourself: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8086.gif"

    alt="News Gothic URW"> <BR>URW <BR> <BR>Adobe&#39;s and Monotype&#39;s are probably
    interchangeable. Linotype&#39;s has basically the same letterforms, but is fitted
    differently. Bitstream&#39;s is a little more open in the counters and seems closest
    to Benton&#39;s original design to my eye. URW&#39;s is clearly different on the
    body.  <BR> <BR>I tend to prefer the Bitstream, but that&#39;s probably because
    I first fell in love with News Gothic through Pentagram&#39;s use of it in Potlatch
    materials and this is the version they use. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

  body: Thanks for that, Kent. <BR> <BR>I like that Pentagram stuff too, if only because
    they seem to <BR>get away with massive body type and leading.

    is a variant of News Gothic that Linotype&#39;s parent company, Heidelberger Druckmaschinen
    AG, uses as a corporate face. Not shown here, and a dead giveaway is the Heidelberg
