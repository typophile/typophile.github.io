  The second edition of <em>Counterpunch</em> (2011) was set with that newly-designed
  typeface.\r\nAny news?"

  body: I have looked at a good number of places that would seem likely to have this
    and found nothing - I do not think it is commercially available.

  body: "\xB6 Too bad, Smeijers decided not to release this rare attempt to reproduce
    one of the typefaces cut by Renaissance man Pierre Haultin. It was a real challenge.
    I hope we get a <em>Le B\xE9</em> typeface someday too."
