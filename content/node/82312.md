    archive website we can read: \r\n\r\n<blockquote>Typefaces: Customized typeface
    on cover and chapter openers</blockquote>\r\nhttp://designarchives.aiga.org/#/entries/%2Bid%3A21145/_/detail/relevance/asc/0/7/21145/jeff-koons-hulk-elvis/1\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it's really close to Knockout n50 and n30...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HulkElvis_Fonts_5408.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
