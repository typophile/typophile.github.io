  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I tried Extensis Suitcase, but it will not work with FlexiSign to identify or activate fonts. I have a load of fonts that really tax my system to leave installed, but can't find anything that says it will work with Flexi...and let's just face it: I don't trust the 503 different "font manager by Joe Schmuck" listings that come up after an internet search. Had someone slip me a couple bad ones before...don't ask.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First, let me say FlexiSign is a great and wonderful program, and would be a great choice for all those folks missing Freehand, if it weren't for the fact that it's dongled and its pricing is so obnoxiously excessive as to preclude any user from acquiring it unless they have an actual business need for the cutter drivers. In spite of its fantastic design features it will forever remain a niche player.

I can't imagine why the makers of Flexi wouldn't cooperate with the developers of font management software. Many sign shops use a broader range of fonts than most design studios.

Have you tried Linotype FontExplorer X? I haven't checked lately on their progress on the windows version, but the one for Mac is the best thing going.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I guess if font developers could figure out a way to put a dongle on their fonts, they probably would...and if I could do it on every logo I made, it would have saved me the frustration of seeing them on the backs of cars all over Texas...but, onward and upward! They have actually come out with non-dongled versions that are connected to the internet...but yeah, the pricing sucks! I have seen some boot-legged versions out there, but obviously you wouldn't want that in your possession for long, right?

I'll check Linotype and see if they have a demo like Extensis...but that didn't go well at all! I even stumped their tech support "guru".</div>
