body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m working on polishing a logotype for a client
  and could use your help pointing out any areas to clean up. I\u2019m rather new
  at modifying type. The original face is Fling.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_4246.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I\u2019m looking for the right serif to use for body copy with this, hopefully something
  that\u2019s classy and modern but maybe with some  feminine character. Hopefully
  with a nice small cap variation.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\nMatt"

    normally a pretty vocal bunch! Thanks for the recommendation Eleanor, I hadn\u2019t
    considered it since I\u2019m not yet real familiar with Constantina. (I\u2019m
    normally on a Mac using Pages)."

  body: Archer might be perfect for body copy here.  It's friendly and elegant with
    a slightly feminine character.
