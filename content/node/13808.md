  under the category of \"hot topic\" as in watch out for all the flames. And without
  further ado:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/9245\r\n\r\ni must admit, a little
  heated discussion certainly makes for interesting reading. i'm just glad this one
  hasn't spiraled into the realm of personal insults. in between flares of personality,
  one can actually find an interesting line of discussion revisting topics including:
  the merits of revivals, interesting technological methods and the debate over the
  definition of \"design.\" threads like this are the reason why i'd rather send my
  entertainment $$$ to typophile rather than the cable company. eat your heart out
  reality tv!"
