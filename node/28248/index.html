<p>Here is version 8 with metrics tinkering and fine tuning most glyphs&ndash;futzed with the g again and with kerning&ndash;see pdf 8 below.
Here is version 7 added, small caps, lining figures, and nom/denom, flattened bottom of g, added most ligs but not the gg yet! I also did more weight and contrast adjustment and changed top of f.&ndash;see pdf 7 below.
Here is version 6 added back a touch of contrast and fattened right bowl of g, see pdf 6 below.
Here is version 5 very slightly heavier serifs and some more smoothing, see pdf 5 below
Here is version 4 very slightly condensed and smoothed and lining figures added, see pdf 4 below
Here is version 3 with contrast rteduced a bit more, see pdf 3 below
Here is version 2 with less contrast, see PDF below.
Here is my first cut at the normal weight of Froggy. So far only caps and lower case no ligs or figs yet!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, I personally don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a matter of display vs text, but what your suits your design best.</p>
<p>I just checked the print-out, and in the smaller size the higher contrast is not as noticeable. But I think this is because of the toner spread, which has percentage wise more of an effect in small size.</p>
<p>I think you might look at the contrasts in Souvenir, and how that has been handled. Your Froggy is a crisper version of the kind of thing that Souvenir and Cooper Black do.</p>
<p>I read in Mac McGrew&rsquo;s book that Benton drew only the medium weight, and Benguiat added the light and popular heavy weights. I don&rsquo;t find the light weight of Souvenir very satisfactory, but the medium and heavy are very good.</p>
<p>On the joins vs other parts, as you know from my TypeCon talk about my Caslon revival, I think that the joins have a different visual logic than other parts, and one can thin the joins more than the rest, as Unger has done in his faces.</p>
<p>And yes, your o is better. But I think also the joins need to get fatter, quicker longer coming out of the stems if that makes sense. That is if you want a very thin join. Also where the thin line coming into the thick line has more space, as in the e, it needs to be more like the top of the o and e, I think. You will need to proof this actually on a high resolution image-setter to get an accurate concept of the effect in small sizes.</p>
<p>Somehow I feel that because your design is quite wide, and the joins are relatively low, you don&rsquo;t really need a sharp join. The top of the mnr will still look clearly separate&ndash;particularly with your semi-serif action.</p>
<p>Also I suspect that a light weight just won&rsquo;t work, as Benguiat&rsquo;s light Souvenir flops, where his heavy is a big winner.</p>
<p>By the way, I know some people hate Souvenir, but they are wrong. My local library uses it on all signs, and it works great. It projects a friendly, welcoming image, while being very readable and disciplined. Your version is more hip and more crisp, but in the same space emotionally, with its warmth and touch of informality.</p>

<p>But as I also noted, more pointed joins (which is what you will get) may conflict with Chris&rsquo;s wonderful design, as it exists in the thicker weight. The medium may work fine with a more uniform branch, so the branch doesn&rsquo;t come to a &lsquo;point&rsquo; when it joins the stem. This is the way Souvenir medium is&ndash;not pointed.</p>

I think the contrast is too great &ndash; in particular for the major thin stems that have no terminating serif.
But if you are worried about it lacking finesse, do a lighter weight.
As William says, Souvenir would be a good reference for stroke contrast &ndash; and I actually quite like its Light weight.</div>

The reason being that it&rsquo;s OK in the o, because its left side is far away. However, the w has closely spaced strokes. (The principle is kind of like the building density allowed by bylaws.) You could perhaps keep the w strokes the same width, but you would have to make the whole character much wider.</div>

If I compare to the regular version,  I&rsquo;m just wondering if the lowercase g in the bold version should&rsquo;nt be better if it was less wide, especially on the lower storey . Don&rsquo;t you think there is two kind (one wide and one condensed) of counterspace for your g?</p>
<p>Really good work!</p>
<p>André</p>
<p>Edited: I take a closer look at the bottom of the bold and the regular g version. The bottom lower storey bold version is flat and the regular version is more round or circular. Is there something to improve on that side?</p>

<p>i disagree that the regular weight needs to be any narrower.
General disclaimer: that suggestion had a question mark after it for a reason, and similarly I have tried to put everything as ideas to try, not definite judgments. This is not only because of appropriate modesty but because in my critiques on typophile I just look and write the first thing that comes into my head about what might improve the face. But it might well hurt it as well. So they are intended as brainstorming trial ideas, and with no pretense to being expert judgments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris, I really like your latest version in the graphic&ndash;I can&rsquo;t open the PDF for some reason. I think you were right to add more contrast back. I suspect Andre is right about about the g&ndash;good catch. I can see what is really tricky here is that changing the weight changes the counters and/or the outside, and you can&rsquo;t preserve both. So you have the challenge of figuring out what will preserve the look, or work best, depending on your goals&hellip;</p>

<p>A couple of things to try, if you haven&rsquo;t already. 1. Are the weights of the serifs too light compared to the joins? Would thickening the serifs a bit give an nice rich croak? 2. The g feels like its almost there, but still needs a little coaxing. Are the joins on the g too thin? Is the ear of the g too thin or too long or something?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks William, I think what the g needs (after so much bezier poking and pulling) is to go through a resmoothing process.  The curves get wounded after doing so much battle. Regarding te &ldquo;thin joins&rdquo; I think I need a hi rez output to see what effect that is. What I see from my laser printer looks fine, or even too heavy at the joins in small sizes.
While Typophile was down, I did several revisions including heavier serifs.  I just thinned them up somewhere between yesterday because the heavier serifs both looked too Clarendon-like to me and gave the font an off balance look.  I think a semiserif can&rsquo;t have the same serif weight as a full serif without getting the leaning tower look.</p>
