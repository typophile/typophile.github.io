  body: "I think this is a customization that may have started with <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/commercial-script-sh/reg/characters.html\">Commercial
    Script</a>. The P is basically the same shape, with a bit of added flourish; the
    k and z are the same; the 'a' is similar, but looks a bit squeezed. The letters
    that don't fit are the 'l' and the 'r'. The looping ascender of the l is not what
    one would expect if the 'k' does not loop (usually they both loop). The 'r' seems
    to have been hand-drawn to try to make the letter more recognizable, since the
    script 'r' can be an unfamiliar shape to people today.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
