  thought it looked SIMILAR to Goudy but not quite on the nose... any thoughts?"

  body: This is a bold weight of Baskerville, available from many foundries. I'll
    leave it to you to sort through the options. :)

  body: "Interesting. \r\nI asked about this on my blog last year:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coldplay_6718.gif]\r\n\r\nIt
    was identified as the Display cut of <a href=\"http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Fleischmann_rdrct.html\">DTL
    Fleischmann</a> (PDF sample is <a href=\"http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/PDF/Fleischmann%20Schriftmuster.pdf\">here</a>,
    see p. 16 for the Display cut).\r\n\r\nYour blurry sample looks a lot like the
    font might be the same. But it's hard to tell for sure since it's so blurry."

  body: 'PS: Look at the serif on the foot of the cap "L", that "spur" is very distinctive
    (and can just be made out in the original sample, I think). Baskerville or Century
    don''t have those.'

    while simply because it matches the type used in their sheet music books but this
    is a much closer match. :)"
