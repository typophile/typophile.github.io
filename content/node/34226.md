  don't think they'll believe me when I say I was just trying to ID a moving typeface..."

  body: About a month ago I was checking out some lettering on the side of an old
    building, and I must have been staring sort of intently at it, because a foreign
    tourist came up next to me a took a picture of it.

    somewhere and pointing at noting in the distance - see if people try and see what
    i''m looking at. That or random queues in front of random doors. '

  body: "A couple months ago, I was on the subway on my way to my typeface design
    class. I was intently looking at some very large print-outs of the font I was
    working on. \r\n\r\nA couple of deaf teenagers started making fun of me, saying
    \"A B C...\" like I was learning my ABC's.\r\n\r\nTrue story."

    on something or other and walk smack into whatever was in front of me before I
    got distracted. Coca-Cola trucks decorated in the late 1980s/early 1990s are the
    worst."

    station name lettering. Shortly after I did, three other people came up and did
    the same thing. (At least no police showed up\u2026)"

  body: I think I remember reading that Tobias Frere-Jones has/had undertaken an extension
    of his Gotham research and was documenting type/lettering at something like every
    intersection in Manhattan. If it's true, I'm sure he got more than his share of
    raised eyebrows, to say nothing of what the DHS would think.

  body: "I think I really got a bad case of type obsession: the hospital my second
    daughter was born in had all kinds of soothing messages printed on the walls of
    the delivery room. \r\n\r\nWhile my wife was giving birth, I could not stop wondering
    what the damn typeface was, I just couldn't remember the name. When my little
    baby girl had finally arrived, and my wife and baby were sleeping soundly, I slipped
    back into the room to take some photos with my mobile. Turned out it was Palatino
    :-))"

  body: "this evening, the sky was threatening and clear at the same time -- right
    around sunset, so the wild clouds were lit up orange and grey against a weirdly
    blue sky. i pulled the car over next to a park that had a terrific vista, and
    started taking photos. after a minute, i could hear someone yelling. turns out
    a group of teenagers thought i was photographing them and started running toward
    me...\r\n\r\n\r\nat moments like these, you're struck with the dilemma of modern
    existence. do i stand my ground, and when they get close, explain they aren't
    even in the photos -- they were all of sky and clouds? or is discretion the better
    part of valor, and do you climb back into the golf and drive away?\r\nas seuss
    asked:\r\n\"well, what would YOU do?\""
