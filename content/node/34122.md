  body: "is there some colour based reasoning behind the choice of each letter or
    is it just arbitrary? cos that makes me wonder what the point is.\r\n\r\nIt reminds
    me of when I was younger and my friend and I translated extracts of a book into
    music by assigning a note to each letter of the alphabet. But there was no reasoning
    to it, we just started with a, and started with a. it sounded odd, but was kinda
    fun - my point is however it was completely impractical and imparted no feeling
    or meaning from the book at all, except you could see patterns from common letters
    like 'e's and'a's."

    body: "Are you suggesting that there is a relationship NOW between the shapes
      of the letters and the sounds that they represent ?\r\n\r\nColor is closer than
      shape in being able to match the spectrums of sound light. That approach was
      tried and rejected.\r\n\r\nSanscript is said to have been created by monks meditating
      for months on the sounds of their language. \r\n\r\nHave you seen Sanscript,
      No connection at all.\r\n\r\nThe shapes of the alphabet evolved and are still.\r\n\r\nThe
      pointr to this medium is that it uses the systems employed by the technology
      of alphabetic applications while freeing us from the restrains of rigid set
      shapes. Like plastics, fluids, or molds.\r\n\r\nTry to draw out a single sentence
      from a new story line in KROMOFONS. What does it look like ? A HAH ! And the
      words with in, or the phrases ? They are all now free to contain meaning or
      spacial relationships, or just be ART. Combined, interwoven, 3-D, the list is
      as endless as the shape of the fluid, after it is poured into the empty vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    do anything to change it? The fact that you enhance (as you claim, though this
    is highly doubtful to begin with) the connection between the shape/colour of an
    individual letter and the sound it represents on its own doesn\u2019t change the
    fact that individual letters frequently lose or change their inherent sound when
    used in conjunction with other sounds. You\u2019d have to apply Kromofons to pure
    IPA for it to make any kind of sense, and even then, it would present no actual
    improvement, since two people will usually pronounce the same word differently.\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, <em>o</em> is a fairly good graphic depiction of the sound the letter represents.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA
    bit silly, perhaps, to be responding to (and even asking questions to) someone
    who most likely just signed up and disappeared again those 11 months ago. Best
    consider this a rant, I guess."
