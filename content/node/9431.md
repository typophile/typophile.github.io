  body: Hehe, I can understand your feelings Miguel, but please consider  <BR>this.
    Each and every one of these beautifully designed typefaces  <BR>took hours, days,
    weeks, months, sometimes years to develop and  <BR>produce. This means a lot of
    talent, dedication, skill and relentless  <BR>work. Plus, not only do they look
    great, but they perform well too -  <BR>they set nicely in your graphics software,
    they don&#39;t make your  <BR>printer crash, hey, they simply make you and your
    work look good. <BR> <BR>So, ask yourself, if you were a type designer, would
    you be willing  <BR>to give the fruit of your labour away for free? I can imagine
    you  <BR>as well have rent or mortgage to pay, phone and electricity bills,  <BR>the
    computer you work on, you like to go out or go see a movie  <BR>once in a while...
    <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s only fair you pay a very reasonable fee to use these  <BR>wonderful
    communication devices.
