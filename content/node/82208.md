    an \"E\" for text.\r\n\r\nBTW, I would:\r\n- Make the ends of the \"T\" heavier.\r\n-
    Maybe loosen the spacing around it, and definitely tighten up \"TAYLOR\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I agree about the spacing. O/R and R/&/C are especially problematic. (I would
    kern the . too)

  body: To help us provide more than aesthetic commentary, can you describe the context?
    What do they do, who are their customers? Is this personal, professional or academic?

  body: "kerning and spacing are not finalised yet.\r\nI'm wondering to ask iKern
    to do the work. anyway..\r\nThe context: this should be a font I'd like to release
    and sell one day\u2026\r\nIt's a modern revisited not a re-digitalisation of classical
    cuts. It will have 3 ampersands, 2 more classic and one more contemporary (the
    one you see) as the default one.\r\nI like it to have an unconventional shape
    but to look like a ligature of /E/ and /T/ as the first /&/ was. And to be readable
    of course! :)"

    the uppercase /T/ or the T end of the ampersand? If the 1st case, so I should
    do the same on /L/ isn't it?"

  body: "Oh, sorry, I haven't checked where you posted this, and wrongly assumed it
    was for a logo or something like that.\r\nFor a typeface, it seems to me that
    R is darker than the rest, especially the joining of bowl and leg. Also the top
    bar of T could be a little more contrasted."

  body: You should really post them both. Nothing to compare it to now. Post the edited
    one here, not at the top. That way people can follow the progress of the work
    and discussion that surrounds it. And is this work professional, personal, or
    academic?
