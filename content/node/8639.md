  body: Chris, I have to agree with Yves that your excuse/justification is weak. <BR>
    <BR>I understand that it&#39;s a pain to shop online without a credit card. But
    luckily, there are several other ways to make payment to acquire goods legitimately.
    <BR> <BR>You can make payment by bank wire transfer to many reputable international
    font distributors, including FontShop at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com" target="_blank">www.fontshop.com</a>.
    <BR> <BR>Since you&#39;re in England, you could contact a UK-based distributor
    such as Faces at <a href="http://www.faces.co.uk" target="_blank">www.faces.co.uk</a>
    to get these fonts. They should be able to take a money order or cashier&#39;s
    check, but I am pretty sure your Switch card would work online or over the phone
    with them. Failing that, you could make arrangements to visit their physical address
    and pay with cold hard cash. <BR> <BR>Another option is to give the cash to a
    family member or good friend that has a credit card and let them make the online
    purchase for you. <BR> <BR>Most people come up with a way to pay for the things
    they want and need. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a method that works for you and
    is fair to those who create and/or supply the goods and services that you wish
    to acquire. <BR> <BR>Good luck!
