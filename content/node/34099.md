  come across is <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com/Feliciano/Merlo/mudTyper+Weights/\">Merlo</a>,
  but maybe something with a little less contrast.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is going to be display
  size, about 40pt.\r\n\r\nA few lines of text above and below a few lines set in
  Helvetica Black.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I don't think a font with lower contrast than Merlo is going to look very
    \"bookish\". And anything contemporary isn't going to look anything like Caslon...
    So what is it you need again?  :-)\r\n\r\nBTW, instead of Helvetica try Unica:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/18387\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I should have been more specific. This is for an art piece and I'm using
    Helvetica because I want the copy to have a very corporate advertise-y look, something
    that people will definintely associate with advertising. I want the text around
    the copy to look like it was from a book. So it should look \"familiar,\" again,
    like from a book, but not contrast to much with the copy. Right now I'm using
    Adobe Caslon because it seems 'neutral', or generic enough, and it's OK, but I
    feel it could be better and can't exactly put my finger on it. That's why I thought
    I'd ask the experts.\r\n\r\nHrant> You're probably right about lower contrast.
    I can not find Unica, even with a Google search.\r\n\r\nScott> Akkurat is nice,
    but I want a heavier weight then they offer, and their fonts are very expensive.
    Corrundum could be possibility, but maybe a bit too \"slabby.\""

    Frutiger and Bembo. \r\n\r\nYou could also be ironic and use Arial Black and Times
    New Roman.\r\n\r\nHelvetica is ubiquitous, it's true. But other faces like Univers
    strike me as being more \"corporate.\" And I can't remember the last time I read
    a book set in Caslon."

    body: "Scott> Franklin Gothic and Frutiger seem too esoteric to me. Remember this
      going to seen by people who are not as attuned to type. But Univers just might
      add that something I felt was missing. I think I was too fixated on Helvetica
      just because it seemed like the obvious thing to use. \r\n\r\nI'm not so much
      looking for a good sans/serif combination as a \"message\" done with type, although
      I do want them to balance well.\r\n\r\nBut I have to say, your idea of using
      Arial Black and Times New Roman is enticing. I don't know how ironic it would
      be, but it sure would be humorous."

    do use a light weight of Helvetica then. (Shudder...)\r\n\r\nI'm now getting the

    _\r\nFor one thing it has that out-of-scale atmosphere about it (I mean\r\nit

    body: "Hrant > I've been using Helvetica Black, but have been experimenting with
      Univers as per Scott's suggestion. At this point I'm liking it better, especially
      the Extra Black, it actually has a more \"advertisey\" feel. Which led to think
      of Helvetica Inserat, which I'm also going to try.\r\n\r\nBookman, that's an
      excellent suggestion, I would never have thought of that. I don't have it, but
      it's pretty cheap, and I only need one weight. Speaking of weight, it's also
      a little heavier which is good. I found at the size I'm using, and with the
      heavy copy, the regular weight looked a little thin, I was using the semibold
      of Adobe Caslon."
