  body: "Hello Bjorn\r\n\r\nI started out digital font design playing with Font Creator.
    It covered just the basics and a decade later I found that it has been developed
    further.\r\nFont Forge seemed more professional but the learning curve was high.
    The same for Fontlab, but so many people use Fontlab and were helpful it has been
    my software of choice. In the beginning I designed with Illustrator and transferred
    to Fontlab, but eventually did all my outlines in Fontlab which is great for that.
    \r\nAll of the above however have some serious limitations for working with complex
    scripts (i.e. Arabic) in some of their functions.  \r\nI had to use MS VOLT to
    finalize the OpenType features necessary to make Arabic fonts work properly.\r\nIn
    addition I have used TransType to create web fonts.\r\nI tried Glyphs demo version
    and found its user interface very appealing, but did not explore it in any detail,
    although I heard some professionals in fonts recommend it highly.\r\nHope this
    helps.\r\n\r\nVladimir"
