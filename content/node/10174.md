  designing a money-related book cover. I would like to know what the monoline sans
  is, I think the G in LEGAL TENDER will give it away. If you can get the 10, then
  I will be ultra happy!  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, kris. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69055.jpg"

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> But it just struck me funny that with 530 posts you&#39;ve
    yet to use the likes of Avant Garde, that&#39;s all! <BR> <BR> <BR><i>... also,
    it&#39;s been a long and busy few weeks, I apologize.  You might have noticed
    I haven&#39;t posted in a good bit &#40;or at least I hope you all think enough
    of me that my absence might be noted!&#41;</i>..

  body: I know! I have a small core of typefaces that I favour, and Avant Garde isn&#39;t
    one of them. It is probably because I haven&#39;t really seem it used well, I
    don&#39;t think it is very common round these parts. Luckily, I have an open typographical
    taste, and look foward to using something new!

  body: I used to hate Avant Garde, simply because it was the default font in CorelDRAW,
    but I&#39;ve actually been using it a lot lately. I think it looks better in all
    caps rather than mixed case. Plus it&#39;s got really cool alternates. <BR> <BR>

  body: I generally prefer Futura to Avant Garde for most display uses, simply because
    I love low x-heights.
