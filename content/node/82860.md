  body: Thanks, oldnick.  I only see publisher info, but not the author. Is this the
    HOMAGE TO THE ALPHABET by Phil Baldus that also has the complete Alpha series?

    with James Hellmuth (named first) and Paul Grant (named last). Rockport Publishers
    printed the book, and Phil's Photo (the company) compiled it. I have the second
    edition from 1985, and this typeface is on page 340 in my copy.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Hmmm...I see that there are two editions listed at alibris.com, one from
    1985 and one from 1990.  Only the 1990 edition is available at Amazon.  Do either
    of you know if the contents of the two editions are the same?  For the record,
    I'm just as interested in the Souvenir Swash as I am the complete Alpha series.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

  body: Souvenir Demi Italic with swash is in the regular section of the 1985 edition
    (which also has three supplements).

  body: Oldnick, are you saying that the swash style ONLY appears in the 1985 edition?  And
    did you mean to type "italic"?  I'm not so interested in that variant.  AAGH!!  Me
    are confused.

  body: I can't say for sure that the swash variants DON'T APPEAR in any edition except
    the 1985 one, because that's the only one I have. They may not appear in previous
    editions, but I would be very surprised if they didn't appear in subsequent editions.
    However, the swash variants are there for both Roman and Italic versions.

    go, right?
