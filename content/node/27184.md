body: ' I think the font you are referring to could be MINI 7. It is a font specially
  designed to be used at small sizes on the web and still be readable. In fact it
  only comes in one size!!! <BR> <BR>To improve readability at small sizes, this font
  is not anti-aliased. This explains why it looks like a dot matrix font when it is
  used in a bigger size. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps. <BR> <BR>www.manic.com.sg '
