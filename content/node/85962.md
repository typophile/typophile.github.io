  body: "What does your company do? What kind of audience are you trying to target?
    What kind of emotion/style are you going for?\r\n\r\nFrom a purely structural
    perspective, some comments:\r\n\r\n - lots of kerning needs to be done here (loo
    at that gap between the U and A for instance)\r\n - why the rigid red lines for
    the crossbars but the sloppy, thick brush stroke on the Q (it's causing some dissonance)\r\n
    - Consider if you even need the red elements (is the uniqueness of the 'Q' enough
    personality?\r\n - The Q is sitting funny. It's not on the baseline, nor is it
    dropping enough to seem intentional.\r\n - The scale between the logo and the
    tagline is too much. There's no way to shrink this down without making the tagline
    illegible.\r\n - the underscore seems unnecessary\r\n\r\nHope that helps!"

  body: The soft edges of the red inside the <strong>Q</strong> could suggest a mouth
    with bright-red lipstick, or perhaps some other bodily orifice. Depending on what
    business you're in, that could be an advantage or a disadvantage.

  body: I'm not sure why you put that red brush stroke within the Q.  Does it symbolize
    something?

  body: I think you need to refine the brief.  What are the top 3 ideas that the logo
    should communicate?  That list is so broad that you will end up with something
    generic or cluttered if you try to represent it all.  What is essential to the
    business image?

  body: "The curly decorative Q seems to say everything *but* IT. I think it'd be
    appropriate for interior design, hair styling--something targeting more of a feminine,
    luxury type of product or service. \r\n\r\nGiven that your company appears to
    be doing a wide range of things, I'd lean towards a simpler solution. Pick a sturdy
    typeface. Set it inside a block of color. Call it good. "

  body: "I agree with \"aluminum\" above. It's a cute logo but it doesn't work for
    your applications at all. Furthermore, the typeface reminds me of [[http://blog.andrewtechhelp.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMAGE_251.jpg|early-1990s
    Microsoft branding]] which probably isn't desirable for a cutting-edge company.\r\n\r\nMy
    suggestion is to put it in a drawer and try something else entirely."
