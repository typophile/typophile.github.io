body: I am currently doing a book for final year students that is useful to potential
  employers if they are willing to take on new designers for work placements or may
  it be for a job. It is a book that has been produced every yr and now this yr, it
  is it's tenth anniversary. So i was wondering if you think this solution is ok or
  not?

    in oldstyle figures 1 and 0 are both the same height, that they should be so different
    from each other suggests that they're not part of the same number. It looks like
    1\xBA to me. "

  body: "Ooops i didn't realise. Sorry. Is that why Nathan above is laughing or does
    he find my design funny? I was really upset when he wrote 'IMHO'. Isn't it suppose
    to be LMHO? I feel really bad about my design now so please Nathan, if you had
    to laugh, atleast you could have told me why :( Don't just laugh and not tell
    me.\r\nZ.D.Smith, the 10 is meant to look like a face and it's also meant to look
    like 1 degree becausethe book is for the end of yr degree show and also because
    of the 10th anniversary of the higher education at the college. Is it still funny
    now? I feel crap about my work now. please encourage, not discourage. You have
    put my cinfidence really down, like beyond ground level :("

  body: "'IMHO' means 'In My Humble Opinion' as opposed to 'IMNSHO' which is 'In My
    Not So Humble Opinion'.  So take heart nobody is calling you names. What is LMHO?
    I have never seen that. Nathan is 'laughing' because that's just his Avatar or
    Icon. It's not directed at you. It looks like that all the time.\r\n\r\nI think
    the 1 degree & 10 think isn't quite gelling yet. Keep going. "

    wise Chopper Reid says, Youll really have to harden the fuck up if you want to
    survive as a designer in the real world!! I would not put work up here just to
    get a confidence boost, the wrong place. \r\n\r\nthe idea is sound, but yer excecution
    has to be much sharper to catch employers attention. IMHO\r\n\r\nMuzz"

    It's the misunderstanding of IMHO as opposed to LMAO as in Laughing My Arse Off.
    Sorry, I did not know it meant In My Humble Opinion. I actually thought that it
    wa smade a joke out of, that's all and that made me upset. I'm not sulking and
    I am not a sulky person. Peace.\r\nEben: Thank you for making it clear to me that
    I am not being laughed at. LMAO means (see above)."

  body: OK, so here goes. On top of that, I have come up with 10 commandments kind
    of idea but for students i.e. I am going to be using words that have the word
    TEN within it so 'atTENtion', 'inTENtion' etc so it will tie in with my theme
    of 'maximise your poTENtial'. What do you think? And could i pull it off by saying
    that the 10 could be understood as 1 degree as in this is your one and only degree'
    or 'this is it!, your 1st degree' or could you think of anything else I could
    say about the 1 degree which is also meant to be a number 10 and a face too or
    am i confusing my audience?
