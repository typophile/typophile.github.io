		<div class="commentbody">Darren, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Welcome to the forum, and thanks for participating!  At risk of repeating Ricardo's critique, it appears that the face (at least at this magnification) has varying stroke weights within the letters. This creates dark spots in letters like the S. I will make this request, howver- can you set some words and/or phrases in the face? Sometimes it helps to see the overall color and rhythm of the face to effectively critique it. And oftimes, variation and nuance within the face itself can really bring the type to life.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Darren, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This has the potential to be a great and highly versatile typeface. Ironically, it reminded me of Erik Spiekermann's faces (Officina, Meta), but I too can see the similarities with Hubert Jocham's faces now that the resemblances have been pointed out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would echo all of the suggestions so far, and add a couple of my own: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. As Ricardo mentioned about the lc &quot;a&quot; being a bit condensed, you may want to look at all of the letters' widths in relation to one another. The proportions seem slightly off (lc &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; and uc &quot;V&quot; seem a bit wide, while lc &quot;a&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, uc &quot;J&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;W&quot; seem narrow). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. You may want to try bringing the vertex of the lc &quot;y&quot; down closer to or slightly below the baseline. This may help balance the body with the tail, and also may help balance its width with the other characters. OR, as an alternative to this, try widening the angles of the two strokes just a bit. Or maybe a little of both. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. I agree that the lower case set seems lighter than the upper case and figures sets. I like the look of the weight of the upper case and figures, so I would suggest making the lower case slightly heavier. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I really like the design of the lc &quot;a&quot;. And I find the differing terminal cuts on the uc &quot;K&quot; and lc &quot;k&quot; to be really interesting. It would be interesting to see you apply the same terminals to some other characters, such as uc &quot;R&quot;, uc &quot;X&quot; and lc &quot;x&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm looking forward to seeing this face evolve. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David</div>

There are also a few other problems that I need to resolve - the U/C Q is a little heavy, as are a few other characters and maybe the proportions of the U/C N needs looking at. Some of the characters with accents need tweaking also. Anyway, that aside, any other comments</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think your lc is looking great, except: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. The &quot;k&quot;'s upper arm is/seems too long. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. The &quot;m&quot;'s counters seem unequal. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. The &quot;w&quot; is too wide. I know it's tempting to make it two &quot;v&quot;s (I've done that myself), but it's better to make the strokes less inclined; you might also consider stopping the middle part before it reaches the x-height - it helps readability. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For your UC, I like most of the forms individually, but I think you have an important -and equally challenging- decision to make: do you want all the caps to approximately converge in width (the &quot;contemporary&quot; approach), or do you want them to diverge (like in &quot;old style&quot; fonts)? The latter I myself prefer, even in designs like this, not least because it makes all-caps setting much less unreadable. Right now it seems your caps are somewhere in between the two approaches, and I think that's a problem. Also: there's still some color imbalance, although a GIF is a terrible place to judge that - you really have to go lino before you can be confident of the color (especially as mass text). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Numerals: very nice, except for the joins of the &quot;6&quot; and &quot;9&quot; being tucked in too much - note how nice and open your &quot;8&quot; is. Your &quot;7&quot; is killer. I might make the zero rounder. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Accents: they seem unfinished, at least in terms of placement. I'd just say that your ring might be a little too light, and you could raise the umlauts a bit, esp in the lc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd make the &quot;ae&quot; one glyph: flatten the top of the &quot;a&quot;'s bowl to unite the strokes; get rid of the &quot;a&quot;'s stem at the baseline. The slashes on your &quot;O&quot;/&quot;o&quot;/cent are too steep. The Yen's top bar is clotting. The dollar looks unbalanced - but to be honest I actually like to encourage ugly dollarsigns. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Hrant <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I totally see your comments - I actually looked at the lc 'k' and 'm' today and thought the same. I didn't see the w being too wide though, but I shall revisit it and make amendments - the point about the middle part being lowered I understand and will investigate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The UC does have a problem with its proportions which I think comes from me being a total (but hungry) novice. The colour imbalance is again a problem which I feel stems from both my 'beginner' approach and my relative inexperience with the software - they looked fine on paper! I do need to make a decision as to their proportions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The numerals are a first draft and the '6' and '9' do need opening up I agree. Thanks for the positive comments - I was a little nervous as the previous lining numerals were awful, and I wasn't totally sure about these ones - although I felt they were a lot better than their predecessors. This is pretty much the first time they have all been put together with the other characters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The accents again are 'work in progress' and do need some tweaking. The 'ring' does need some weight adding to it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The 'ae' glyph has gone a little crazy - I just looked at the paper based drawing and on that I had removed the a's stem - quality control a little lax there! The comments about the other characters I will take on board when I make some amendments. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks very much for your input - your comments are greatly valued. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll post a revision up as soon as it's ready. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Darren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Darren: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope you're going to include BOTH lining and old-style numerals, as they each have their place. Old-style numerals, in general, are best for text settings, of course, but lining numerals are generally preferred for headlines and tabular columns. With a versatile font like this one, the inclusion of both types of numerals would be most appropriate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant mentioned most of the suggestions that I noticed (and a few that I thought were fine as they are, but I'll be interested to see how you incorporate them anyway&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> ). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as your upper-case proportions, take a look at: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe Trajan (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4465.html">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4465.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->), <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe Charlemagne (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily1163.html">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily1163.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) or <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe Penumbra (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_907.html">http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_907.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->for comparison.

It's hard to know if Darren intends this to be a text face (and frankly that almost doesn't matter: the hardest part of making a text face is &quot;simply&quot; convincing others that it's a text face!), although some things (like the OS nums) seem to indicate that.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Joe here. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In general I agree with the common notion that good text faces tend to be serified, but I also point out that there are several excellent exceptions to this rule. Franklin Gothic, Helvetica, Univers, Bureau Gothic, Officina, Meta, Gill Sans, Radiant, Syntax, and Scala Sans (among many others) are all examples of serifless faces that work well for setting some text applications. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->No font, serifed or serifless, works equally well for setting all text applications. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If we have learned anything typographically in the 20th century, it is that to talented designers, the long-held rules of typography must be both followed and broken. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Remember also that Carter's &quot;snap-on serifs&quot; were an experiment in themselves; classic serifs were designed into the font from day one, never designed as an afterthought to be snapped on after the fact. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In my view, Iris stands alone as a well-designed (and evolving) sans-serif face, and that direction should be seen through to the end. A serifed version can come later. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Watching this one grow with much interest, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, Walker was comissioned by Laurie Makela when she was running the design operation at Walker in the early '90s I think. There has been a lot written about the Walker type. One good article can be found in Eye no. 19 (1995). It's all about how the font was comissioned and designed.

Even during my studies in Holland. The good thing about the font is not only its quality, but it reflexes your love, interest and willingness to design type!! Which is often difficult to find. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am curious about your serifed version. Because in your font the ending are very typical and therefore pretty important for its character. And that is where later on the serifs will be! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->About the textface issue. Guys, we live in 21st Century! Last century some designers proved us, sansserifs can be used and designed very well as textfaces!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Andy, thanks for reference. Barnes and Noble doesn't have it, but Borders does. I'll check it out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now that I think about it, Letterhead Fonts and others (Font Diner's Milwaukee, I think it's called) have a similar concept, that is fonts that you build by layering two fonts together. Walker seems like its the first to do this with self-contained serifs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is something I'm going to experiment with surely because I want to find out 'how' to do it and because the font is 'private', that makes it more interesting. It may be uncommercial but all work and no play makes jack a dull boy, eh? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> (That's just a reference to an American movie, The Shining w/ Jack Nicholson, no hidden meanings or anything.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->re, the serifs: A readability question. Why do serifs help us recognize words better?  Growing up, kids see a lot of san-serifs, especially when they are learning 'lettering' in first grade. Does anyone have a short answer?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Readability in the future would make a nice discussion topic <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Totally. I think -like you implied- it depends a lot on display technology. LCDs are becoming standard, which means ClearType-style technology will be a big factor, but also I think there's room for more hand-crafting of bitmaps, very much so in grayscale. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; no hidden meanings or anything <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yeah, right (you obsessive, ax-wielding font freak). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Why do serifs help us recognize words better? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's hard to keep it short (especially when one has to first dismiss a bunch of traditional but laughable theories - like the one that says they help guide the eye like train tracks&hellip; gimme a break, linespacing already does that 100 times better, thank you very much), but I see it as two-pronged: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Serifs help distinguish one glyph from another (to varying extents). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Serifs help glyphs coalesce into boumas (word shapes), instead of standing out individually. Kind of like why tight spacing helps readability, noting that if you space a sans too tightly the counters overpower the inter-letter spacing (ruining the distribution of color in a bouma), while in a serif face the serifs start touching (facilitating the coalesce thing) before that happens/needs_to_happen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is in addition to the familiarity factor (which some people however over-rate). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>
