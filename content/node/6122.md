body: Hey everyone, I was wondering if you can give your insight on a personal desigh
  project, it would be greatly appreciated.  <BR>I am currently designing a buiseness
  card for myself. It includes simple yet elegant type letterpressed on 100 percent
  cotton card stock. Now the design element I want to incorporate is the use of custom
  made rubber stamps of some of my &#34;type&#34; specimens and artwork. Since I will
  make several rubber stamps I&#39;ll have a few unique cards I can distribute to
  clients. I feel this will give the design a feeling of individuality and imagination.
  And if I ever get tired of a specific image I can just have new rubbrestamps made.
  What do you think?

  body: I assume you&#39;re printing the cards 8 to a page. If so I suggest you do
    the rubber stamping before they&#39;re trimmed. I know from experience it goes
    much faster that way.  <BR>George <BR>
