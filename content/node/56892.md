  exceeds a (very low) tolerance level, I get complaints from bored readers. So I
  decided to make Flickr my type-stuff-posting refuge. Apart from here I mean :-)\r\n\r\nHave

    printed matter...

  body: "Ben: thanks, yes Furet is still in the works, although I've put it on the
    sideline for the moment, to return to it with a fresh eye. I made that preliminary
    specimen because it was a project I was doing at art academy, so I had to show
    it.\r\n\r\nAnd I was quite pleased with the family portraits myself too. ;)\r\n\r\nNina:
    Yeah, the duct tape project was quite fun to do. Unfortunately we had very little
    time to 'tack it on' so to speak. But in spite of that, I think it turned out
    pretty ok. :)\r\n"

    close that window now, otherwise I'll never do anything else today. ;)

    Is there more - like a pdf? I particularly love the 'g' which may be the 'signature'
    glyph.

    glyph in there, and it took me a while to figure it out.)\r\n\r\nErnestine is
    hoggin' a long thread in the critique section,* of which an update is imminent
    &ndash; I'll post a PDF of the full alphabet (with caps, and hopefully a first
    draft of the numerals) very shortly, certainly this week. I'm not really wanting
    to show too much of it on Flickr before it goes up here.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/53395"

    it out properly soon though, you can be sure. Thanks for sharing it.
