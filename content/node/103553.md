body: "I started looking for help on this in December.  I tried What The Font, a message
  board that is related to the subject (firearms), a message board that has a fair
  number of graphic artists, and also the manufacturer.  Just recently I was told
  about this forum so I figured I'd give it another go.\r\n\r\nSo I've got a gun part.
  \ It came already engraved as seen in the first attached picture \"OrigEngraving\",
  and I would like to add my own engraving in the same font.  The engraving company
  I have contacted for the job said they can do any TTF font.\r\n\r\nI did my best
  to trace the letters so What The Font could \"see\" the letters (see \"tracelettertry\")
  and the best I've come up with is Chevin Light.  I typed the same information up
  as the engraving with Chevin Light and that is attached as well as \"ChevinLightExample\".\r\n\r\n\"ACDEFGHIMNORSTU\"
  are all the letters I intend to have engraved, with 'H' being the only one not on
  the original engraving.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe areas that bother me:\r\n'A' - Curved sides,
  bar too low\r\n'G' - Less rounded\r\n'O' - Less rounded\r\n'M' - Too narrow, center
  too low\r\n'S' - Less rounded\r\n'W' - Center too high\r\n\r\nSo anyway, that's
  where I'm at.  Any help would be appreciated in either finding the correct font
  or modifying Chevin Light.\r\n\r\nAlmost forgot.  I was also pointed to \"US BLOCK
  1L\" a GravoStyle engraving font, which would make sense but the 'M' 'W' & 'G' are
  definitely wrong with that font."
