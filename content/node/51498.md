  body: "Iris, I don't understand your question. What does \"ofc\" and \"w&w\" mean?\r\nWeights
    beginning with a 4 are light,\r\nWeights begininig with a 5 are regular\r\nWeights
    beginning with a 6 are medium,\r\nWeights beginning with a 7 are bold,\r\n\r\nstyles
    ending with a 5 are upright roman\r\nStyles ending with a 6 are italic\r\nStyles
    ending with a 7 are condensed,\r\n\r\nIn other words. Univers 55 is regular weight
    standard width roman\r\nUnivers 65 is medium weight standard width roman\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "thank you for your answer.\r\nofc is ofcourse, w&w is weight and width.\r\n\r\nmaybe
    i dont understand the assignment so good, but.\r\ni have to pick minimum 4 different
    styles from the family but it must have some sense- i have to find that sense
    so i can combine 4 good ones together.i pick some 4 (light, bold, oblique..) the
    teacher said \"no no i'm not sure that one fits, check frutiger's numbering system.)
    i'm a very big beginner and my classes are on language i dont understand so please
    have some understanding about my probably stupid question. thanks!!"

  body: "I'm not sure exactly what your teacher's asking for, but if i was going to
    pick 4 fonts from Univers to go together I'd do this: choose one to start, then
    find a bold, italic, and bold-italic version of it.\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n55
    (normal)\r\n56 (italic)\r\n75 (bold)\r\n76 (bold italic)\r\n\r\nor:\r\n47 (\"normal\"
    in this example)\r\n48 (italic)\r\n67 (bold)\r\n68 (bold italic)"
