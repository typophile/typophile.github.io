  identifying the font used in this logo. The company I work for recently bought over
  this company, but for some reason they didn't give us a vector or high-res version
  of the logo, so I'm trying to recreate it.\r\nRan it through WhatTheFont but no
  luck.\r\nThanks in advance and I appreciate the help."
