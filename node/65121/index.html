  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all, I&rsquo;m working on a rebranding of a trio of female photographers, they were previously &ldquo;random grouping of initials&rdquo; photography and want to develop a more distinct identity to stand out in a crowded marketplace, and after some soulsearching have decided to go with simply &ldquo;the girls&rdquo; since that&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re often referred to anyway.</p>
<p>They wanted to avoid the standard photography cliches of camera, lens, scripty typeface, etc., and wanted something feminine but not overly feminine that had a bit more of a fashion feel to it. I did some research and liked the idea of using a symbol that represented the 3 of them, and after running across a diagram of an exposure triangle I found interesting I developed this mark. To me it leans feminine and evokes a flower shape without being explicitly floral, has the abstrat photographic reference of the exposure triangle, could be used with or without the type, and should apply well across a variety of media. The typeface is Proxima Nova (please forgive the pixelation, using a screengrab as I haven&rsquo;t purchased the typeface yet). Thoughts?</p>

<p>&hellip;it has the feel of an asterisk to it, so I wonder if turning it a bit will break up this symmetry you have going on. (I see that you intended this, that right now the mark almost acts as a sort of anterior parenthetical).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I actually really like the asterisk sort of idea, definitely up for trying that. The danger in rotating the mark, however, is that with a vertical stroke coming off the &ldquo;star&rdquo; you get the distinct impression of toxic waste&hellip;not quite what we&rsquo;re going for :)</p>
<p>I think the direction you&rsquo;re thinking would have it pointing towards the upper left which I think could work. Let me do a bit of playing and see.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Awesome, can&rsquo;t wait to see it.</p>
<p>Valid point about toxic waste, though I assume this logo isn&rsquo;t going to be black and yellow. Once you figure out a color scheme you might just give the rotation a shot and see if the right palette helps it read as you intended.</p>
<p>I also have to second not being in love with the chosen typeface. But I do see a good rationale for playing with the weights as you have&ndash;in terms of what you say might happen to it in the future (adding .com, etc.), right now it has the pleasing effect of balancing the logotype&rsquo;s heavy weight from the mark.</p>
<p>As an aside, good job. You always post nice logos on this forum, and as a designer who loves photography&ndash;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed seeing the photographer logos you&rsquo;ve created.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks man, greatly appreciated. I&rsquo;ve found a bit of a niche that&rsquo;s both challenging and provides some fun clients to work with, it&rsquo;s been good so far.</p>
<p>I actually had some colors in mind that I&rsquo;d been working with, I think the grey helps soften it overall and makes it a bit less contrasty. Looking at it I do think that the mark should be sized down a bit in any case, I also played with your thoughts using that color pallette as well. Kinda what you were thinking? I think it has potential.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yup, precisely what I was thinking in the second version of your new attempts. Def. reduce the mark&rsquo;s size as you said.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see a ribbon &amp; bow myself. But if it looks a little girly, well, isn&rsquo;t that a good thing?</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a little obscure, but who hasn&rsquo;t seen an obscure mark on a logotype before? And for that matter, I&rsquo;ve seen many that look nice but def. don&rsquo;t speak to the business in question. For me, as long as there is an original &amp; relevant intent behind it&ndash;that it&rsquo;s not just a shape to be a shape, then that&rsquo;s acceptable to me. This speaks to the three-ness, and is born out of something photographic&hellip; I don&rsquo;t see the problem.</p>

<p>Changing up the color palette a bit and moving the blue to more of a lavender/purple helps, but I&rsquo;m thinking the type choice could also be more appropriate. Any ideas on a maybe more feminine yet still well put together typeface that might work? Thanks.</p>

<p>I like your 3 dots. I think playing with them in the I is also a good idea. You can cary the dots on through the entire identity. Leader lines could be dots. You can use centered dots instead of hyphens. Dots create great patterns. Lots of possibilities.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, some revisions. I played with several numerica replacement ideas and liked some more than others.</p>
<p>First was the &ldquo;TH3&rdquo; idea. I tried it in several different typefaces and didn&rsquo;t really find anything I loved. I felt like these with Reminga, Eplica, and Meta Serif were the best of the group but I don&rsquo;t love any of them, definitely need to work with the weights if I went this direction.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/th3girls_4720.jpg]</p>
<p>The &ldquo;3irls&rdquo; idea I actually found a lot more success with. After running through a number of different typefaces I found that Mrs Eaves has an attractive 3 that really lent itself well to work as a g, then a bit more playing revealed that it&rsquo;s actually a absolutely beautiful italic character (I&rsquo;m really liking the bottom choice).</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3irls01_5435.jpg]</p>
<p>And a look at it subsituting the dots as the i, which is ok but doesn&rsquo;t say much to me. I feel like this could have some potential, may do some more sketching/playing with it.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/girls_dot_5451.jpg]</p>
<p>Any thoughts? Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The problem with the top ones (th3 girls) is that you&rsquo;re mixing small caps with lowercase. It also looks like you have &lsquo;the&rsquo; scaled back, so the contrasting weights of the strokes don&rsquo;t mesh well either.</p>
<p>If you did want to explore that direction further I&rsquo;d say you would need to go all small caps. I would also set the type on the same line. That way might be rather simplistic (possibly boring) but I think Eplica gives enough flavor to the characters, that it might work. And of course if additional flavor is needed, you can always edit the characters to your liking.</p>
<p>I do like the lower experiments here with mrs. eaves. You&rsquo;re right about the italic working the best too. The one issue that may (or may not) become a problem will be that people might read it as &lsquo;the 3 girls&rsquo;. Good stuff though.</p>

FWIW the &ldquo;3irls&rdquo; potentially reads as &ldquo;zirls&rdquo; to me, with a descending &ldquo;z&rdquo; (and especially so in the italic version). But maybe that&rsquo;s a European/German thing.</p>
<p>How about a regular &ldquo;i&rdquo; but with 3 tittles instead of just one? Stacked, or maybe try a triangle/circle/flowery arrangement. Might be nicely subtle.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks all, some good thoughts and feedback. The more I&rsquo;ve looked at it the more I like the idea of &ldquo;3irls&rdquo; over the other options. altaira, I think you seeing the &ldquo;z&rdquo; is a bit of a European perspective but I can definitely see where you&rsquo;re coming from.</p>
<p>I think closing off the &ldquo;3&rdquo; just a bit does a lot, I played with adding an ear on the second variant but that&rsquo;s starting to look TOO much like a g and is losing it&rsquo;s &ldquo;3-ness&rdquo;. Forgive the roughness, these are quick photoshop cut-and-pastes):</p>

<p>I think with a bit of refinement the first could work really well. Any thoughts on &ldquo;the&rdquo;? I think it could be a bit heavier but there&rsquo;s only one other weight in Mrs Eaves and it&rsquo;s quite bold. Thanks guys.</p>

Does 3=Z?
Does G=Z?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve moved away from any association with photography that was present in your earlier sketches/comps. But whatever the solution is must be simple.</p>
<p>As far as the 3 goes, my thoughts go to the roman numeral III. Maybe that can be incorporated somehow instead of the I, or using the vertical strokes in the roman &ldquo;Gir&rdquo; or &ldquo;irl.&rdquo;  Of course, this might be too complicated as well!!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Great thoughts all, thanks. aluminum, you lost me slightly&hellip;make it blatantly a 3 or a g? evanbrog, I don&rsquo;t disagree, I actually liked having a bit more concept in the originals but it&rsquo;s evolved a bit differently.</p>
<p>In any case, unfortunately, the client isn&rsquo;t totally on board. They&rsquo;re not opposed to integrating the idea of three somehow (dots, lines, etc.) but the very stylized serif idea just didn&rsquo;t work for them (the exact comment was that they &ldquo;thought that was a cool idea, but we&rsquo;re still drawn to the straight, simple, modern font (i.e. sans) similar to what we showed you&rdquo;). In other words, something in the almost purely typographic sans arena.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m debating&hellip;I&rsquo;ve been looking at some slightly stylized sans (Tondo or Bree were possibilities) but I&rsquo;m worried it&rsquo;s going to be tough to convey a lot of personality in a really simple sans. Another thought was something like the example, combining the &ldquo;3&rdquo; idea with a nicely compatible sans (Mr Eaves) and letting that be the focus of the logo. I don&rsquo;t know that this quite works (definitely kerning adjustments needed) but I think the idea is on the right track. Thoughts? (penn, I&rsquo;m going to play with the teardrop thought, interesting idea.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, so we&rsquo;ve got a Motley Crue song and a threesome&hellip;appreciate the input, but I don&rsquo;t think either is quite speaking to the image we&rsquo;re going for :)</p>
<p>Agreed that the weights aren&rsquo;t working on the italic 3/g with the sans, that would need some work if it can even work at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been going back through the previous options to see what I&rsquo;ve done so far that I liked and felt might speak to the typographic desires of the client. I like the personality that Bree conveys, it&rsquo;s a bit cute without being overly feminine and I think has some really nice lines. The &ldquo;g&rdquo; is a love it or hate it sort of character, but I had the idea that that might work as a character to set off with the rest of the word set in all caps.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thegIRLS_6627.jpg]</p>
<p>I did a rough photoshop thicken on the bold &ldquo;g&rdquo;, the weights of the thin set would definitely need to be adjusted. The LS gap is a bit awkward too. I&rsquo;m not sold on the placement of &ldquo;the&rdquo; at this point, but I think the overall feel is actually working really well. Thoughts?</p>

<p>That being said, their comment on the last iteration was that they liked it but there was something about the &ldquo;g&rdquo; that they didn&rsquo;t like, could they see a more modern or less &ldquo;swirly&rdquo; font. I think the &ldquo;g&rdquo; is what makes it work as it&rsquo;s a unique character that sets it off, I tried to show them that by creating an identical version with Bree&rsquo;s more traditional two-story &ldquo;g&rdquo;:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thegirls_final02_5365.jpg]</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t heard back yet on this, I don&rsquo;t dislike the more traditional version but it seems a bit boring to me. Any other thoughts for a typeface that might work? I&rsquo;m thinking a nice clean sans but something with a bit of personality to it. Most of what I&rsquo;ve tried ends up looking rather generic as there&rsquo;s not a lot of letters to work with.

<p>Really cool idea on the typeface, I personally think it would look fantastic but I&rsquo;m afraid the client is going to want something more along the lines of what penn mentioned. Can&rsquo;t hurt to give it a shot though, thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, after a bit of feedback I <em>think</em> I have a better sense of what they want. More accurately, they&rsquo;ve started designing themselves which is a bit terrifying.</p>
<p>Quote from them with the graphic sent:
<cite>We have all agreed that we like the logo we created with the 3 bullets, we also agree that we like the combination of the lower case and upper case and we like thin letters.  We just don&rsquo;t like the lower case &ldquo;g&rdquo; for some reason and no matter what typeface we see I don&rsquo;t think we will like it.</cite></p>
<p><cite>The reasons we like it is because the letters look modern, classy, the 3 bullets kinda say there are 3 of us without being obvious and also gives it something more than just &ldquo;the girls&rdquo; but yet it is still simple.</cite></p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/girls_logostamp_6736.jpg]</p>
<p>To say that I&rsquo;m beyond frustrated at this point goes without saying. In any case, from what I can narrow down it seems like they really like the three dots concept and despite mentioning several sans fonts earlier appear to like a very thin serif typeface as the primary.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got any direction/ideas here I&rsquo;d love to hear them, at this point anything helps :) Thanks!</p>

<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/girlslogo_card_6068.jpg]</p>
<p>I really felt like the dots were a bit stuck on in their version, as I think a lot of you did, so I wanted to experiment with how the dots could really work more as one element of the overall brand. So these are a few quick examples of how the card might look and how the dots could be a recurring pattern with the three set off with just a bit of color (option 3 on the right by penn).</p>
