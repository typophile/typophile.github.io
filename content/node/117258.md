    Fraktur is close but the digital does not include the lighter weight\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/walbaum+fraktur/fonts/\r\nNeue
    Luthersche Fraktur http://www.myfonts.com/search/Neue+Luthersche+Fraktur/fonts/
    has both a light and heavier weight.\r\nFette Fraktur http://www.myfonts.com/search/fette+fraktur/fonts/
    is very close to the letterforms, but looks too heavy. No light version.\r\nVery
    few Frakturs have been digitized.\r\nDon"

  body: "Many Fraktur fonts are rather close.\r\n\r\nI was just about to post the
    same recommendation of Neue Luthersche Fraktur because of the two weights. You
    might also check out <a href='http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/index.htm'
    target='_blank'>Paul Lloyd's</a> Proclamate (hit the Black Jewels link, then use
    the dropdown menu) for the same reason - plus four decorative variants as a bonus."

  body: "The best match I've found by far for the lighter heading is Neue Fraktur
    in Typoasis' <a href='http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/index.htm'
    target='_blank'>Blackletter Revival</a>. It even contains very similar didone-style
    numerals. The download contains two files, Neue Fraktur & Neue Fraktur Extra Bold.
    The latter is too heavy, but perhaps manually bolding the regular weight would
    work.\r\n\r\nThis collection was lovingly digitized by Manfred Klein and cybapee
    (Petra Heidorn) almost a decade ago and offered via Petra's Typoasis website.
    The internal copyright of these fonts state, \"Johannes Wagner, Hausschnitt\"
    with the Extra Bold adding a date of 1927.\r\n\r\nYou won't find cybapee or Manfred's
    names in the copyright of most of this collection. Having been in contact with
    Petra Heidorn several times back then, I know that she valued privacy rather than
    accolades, offered all her fonts for free and both of them wanted to credit the
    original designers. Unfortunately, that has a negative consequence since, years
    later, you only have the word of a guy like me to assure you that the font is
    legitimate and not a clone of someone else's font. In fact, back when these were
    made, several were the very first digitizations of some of these blackletters."

  body: "Thanks Mike. This would work for as a substitute for the lighter Fraktur.
    I appreciate your comments on the fontmaking ethos of that era compared to today.
    The idea of making a font for the sheer love of doing it and then giving it away
    seems to have faded away. \r\nDon"

  body: "Walbaum Fraktur and Fette Fraktur are both fair matches for the bold sample,
    but Walbaum Fraktur is too light and Fette fraktur is too heavy. Here is an interesting
    experiment in which the two are blended 50-50 \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WalbaumFetteFraktur50-50blend_6575.jpg]\r\nWith
    some editing a font maker could make a almost exact match.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "You're welcome Kieran. As for the use of the right Fraktur, for better or
    worse most people today can not read Fraktur capitals with any ease and they tell
    the swirly ones apart mainly from context. The exception may be mathematicians
    who use very standardized versions of the capitals as math symbols. But for other
    readers the mix and match choices offered by Mike and myself should work fine.\r\nDon"
