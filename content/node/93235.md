    FontLab by right clicking on a node. Then select 'Make Node First' from the context
    menu."

  body: "I think this must be the issue of the starting node needing to be Sharp,
    not Smooth - because the two BCPs cannot be guaranteed to form a smooth connection
    for the starting node (the way bezier math works). But AFAIK it's a technicality
    - the font will still work fine. And if there are no Sharp nodes in the contour
    at hand (the biggest example being the -typical- /o) then you have no choice.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
