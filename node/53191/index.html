I have no idea who Jim Marcus is but this font is a, how do you say, direct rip of a calligraphic form that was used and perfected, by a calligrapher, for decades &hellip; Alfred Linz. I have looked. to no avail, for the least little tribute to Herr Linz and have found none.</p>
<p>When I posted on the other node the other night, about a lack of originality and theft, this is exactly what I was talking about. Where are the ethics? If T26 does not know about this then that is fine, but they need to know that this crap goes on right under their own roof.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A large part of early T26 fonts were all produced as collages of existing forms.
On one side, it was a direction for research, on the other side, I was horrified by what T26 started to do, especially considered I was going to release with Emigre, which has always been painstakingly precise and thoroughly conscious in ethic matters.</p>
<p>I have to say, however, that most of Jim Marcus typefaces were not so bad, they showed a quite original research in this &ldquo;collage&rdquo; aesthetic, despite the disputable methods of approach. Problem was they offered types with incomplete character sets, produced often with little or no care. Among the T26 catalog, however there were true gems, like Frank Heine Amplifier and the original Tema Cantante by Eric Lin.</p>

<p>Linz&rsquo;s work was not something to be picked through like it was garbage on the street! Collage&hellip; what a interesting term for theft of intellectual property!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have not said the various aspects of those works are ethically fine.
I just noted what was happening, on a general level, and the difference lies precisely there: who produced the most interesting work developed it to a degree which no longer relied on original elements of inspiration to be considered a theft or even a copy.</p>
<p>Especially if you say this one is from the work of a renowned calligrapher.
For his typeface &ldquo;Masoch-Dirach&rdquo;, for example, Jim Marcus &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; the forms of that typographical masterpiece which is Peter Behrens' Behrens Antiqua, presumably from printed sources since no digital version existed.
It&rsquo;s largely questionable how this approach could make sense. As you say, as long as you do not differentiate enough from your source, and produce a simple alteration, it&rsquo;s really deprecable and that&rsquo;s why I hated so much T-26 when they came to the scene.</p>
<p>I did not expect such a bad thing, and it trashed the whole efforts Rudy Vanderlans was putting into having those new experimentations recognized, when they were conducted on a path of absolute ethical integrity (P. Scott Makela &ldquo;Dead History&rdquo; was entirely re-digitized to make his type research a work on its own, as much as Brian Schorn &ldquo;AddMorph&rdquo; was never released because it depended on the digital data of Adobe Trajan).
Now we pay the price…</p>
