  heavily custom, was just wondering if there was a similar typeface available - digging
  the contrat of thicks and thins\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!\r\nDanny[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maeven-1_4751.jpeg]"

  body: "As you said, I'm also convinced it's (heavily) customized or even totally
    created from scratch, almost everything done with the same rectangle, differently
    slanted from /E to /N or with the same right oblique part of /A: /M done with
    2 /A, /E is \"only\" 4 strokes, /V  with a 180\xB0 rotated /A.... You could also
    do the same with any contrasted font, some kind of \"Didot Sans Stencil\"\r\nFor
    the easy way, I would go with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/reserves/vanitas-stencil/|Vanitas
    Stencil]].\r\n"
