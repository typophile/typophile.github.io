  body: I think you're trying too hard for a clever look, but I'm not sure that's
    appropriate for a wedding venue. Unless all the guests are hip designer types,
    you're probably better of doing something more instantly read.

  body: "I favor version B. It's a bit more subtle, but the line break still gets
    the point across. I don't see trying too hard to be clever here at all. It's a
    wedding . . . to the people involved, you can never try too hard.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    don't dumb down a good design just because everyone might not get it at first.
    Chances are that everyone will get it right away anyway, as they'll all know the
    bride&groom's names. \r\n\r\npenn"

    still remains that it's too reminiscent of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_constant|Planck's
    constant]], which pulls in quantum physics, which in turn is associated with uncertainty
    concepts and such .. not something that everyone would want to have on a wedding
    cake :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/planck_4605.gif]\r\n\r\n.\r\n"

  body: "yes, just as meantioned above, I'm not even sure of the letters... \r\nis
    it i og l?  and I also think of an n... \r\n..that joins to an h?   but hopefully
    the guests know.\r\n\r\nIt looks very sleek and minimalistic, is this typical
    traits of the couple?\r\nor is there a way you could make the 'two parts / people'
    visually different in the logo?  As they 'join' in the circle to a unit, you cld
    nicely create the letters of two simmilar but differnt fonts, maybe..?  showing
    a joint of two items. Just a thought. "

    logo. It's personal. No need to worry about Doctorate degreed Mathematicians making
    a stink out of it (unless by chance the couple both happen to have Math doctorates).\r\n\r\n"

    do agree direction is what I am going to convince them to go with.\r\nThe serif
    on the n is a bit distracting. Without it, the n still reads an n and a bit more
    fluid.\r\n\r\nthanks everyone again for you insights.\r\n\r\n:tony"
