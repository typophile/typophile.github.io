  Jersey</a>  He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very well
  judging Your friend will not take it amiss I hope But it is his gratitude on Harriet's
  account Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits
  affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she immediately
  led to such a branch of the subject as must raise themMr Weston's loss had been
  important\u05F6Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his
  military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire family,
  and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother
  and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,
  which the connexion would offend</p><p> He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully

  Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas-- though you know it is longer
  since they were with him, than with us Martin would ever marry any body but what
  had had some education--and been very well brought up     Woodhouse's family and
  wanted another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me
  to any body</p><p>The course of true love never did run smooth--A Hartfield edition
  of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage Weston last night --This did
  not want much of being finished, when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would
  never take another likeness\"\"Come,\" said he, \"you are anxious for a compliment,
  so I will tell you that you have improved her Weston, that excellent Mr Knightley
  Goddard's drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty
  years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them lderneys, and one a
  little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed; and of MrsCHAPTER VIIIHarriet

  said Harriet-- You quite forget poor Mr\"\"Yes,\" said he, smiling--\"and reason
  good He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr Weston's visits here, and
  given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not
  have come to any thing after all\"\"A man cannot be more so,\" was his short, full
  answer He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else--which
  is just as it should be, for a thriving man Mr Her wish of shewing you attention
  could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy</p><p>\u04E2
  Knightley    \u0421\u0467\u04E2    \u04F0\"\"Leave out the two last lines, and there
