  body: "I actually had some hope of finding this in the Script Font ID Guide, but
    I searched Parts 11, 8 and 9 without seeing a match. The uneven letter sizes and
    slant suggests an amateur font design, such as a personal font. The high f crossbar
    is not common, the o is quite large, many letters connected, and the individual
    letters show some skill in their formation. This combination was not found often,
    and also made it hard to decide where to search.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the closest
    available font I saw was <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script08Pg12.html\">Mr
    Kleen DNA</a> (third from the top) from the <a href=\"http://www.signdna.com/v2/index.php\">SignDNA</a>
    folks. It is more regular (professional) looking, but I thought it was similar
    in many ways.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this is a one of a kind personal/custom
    font, made by someone who knows a bit about drawing letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
