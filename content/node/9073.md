body: I&#39;m not sure if this is an appropriate question to ask, but since this forum
  is filled with informed and active designers I wanted to give it a shot. <BR>I&#39;m
  doing a CD design and the band logo is horrible, the cover art is great. Neither
  I as the designer or the artists wants the bands poorly designed logo to be on the
  cover &#40;because it&#39;s akward and doesn&#39;t &#34;work&#34;&#41; but the band
  is dead set against either changing the logo or using a simple tpyographic solution.
  <BR>The record label has agreed to print the band logo on a 4.75x4.75 clear sheet
  of plastic, to slip in over the artwork and I think I&#39;m game with that - but
  I&#39;m not sure of a good printer that would do it, and I&#39;m still new to the
  game of printer hunting &#40;my regular printers can&#39;t do it&#41;. <BR> <BR>Can
  anyone here recommend a printer that&#39;d probably do a 4.75&#34; square on some
  thin clear plastic? Is that too specifc a question?  <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>   Kevin
