  body: "It is certainly based on (the same source as) Mono. Note that in the sample,
    the \u2018i\u2019 has an upper serif; \u2018a\u2019, \u2018n\u2019, \u2018p\u2019,
    \u2018r\u2019 etc. have spurs. "

  body: "I'm beginning to wonder if this could be a custom job, or an unreleased font.
    Would that make sense in the context? \r\nIn any case, it has Cornel Windlin written
    all over it. Mono is his, and he was also part of the team that made FF Magda
    Clean that I linked to above."
