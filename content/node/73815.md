body: "The idea behind Geotica was to build a font out of -more or less- simple geometrical
  line elements. The open wire frame could then be left open or (partially) filled.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/geo_specimen_5737.png]\r\n\r\nGeotica
  comes in four different grades or line thicknesses (One, Two, Three and Four) so
  it\u2019s suitable for a broad use. Each grade has four styles and is loaded with
  swashes, final forms, lots of ligatures and ornaments. There are 16 fonts in total.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/geo_family_4908.png]\r\n\r\nMore
  info on availability you can find > [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/geotica.html|here]].
  \r\nAlso don't forget to have a look at the pdf attached below.\r\n\r\nHope you
  like it!"

  body: "Doing this reminds of how easy production art is these days compared to my
    earlier years. This took me 20 minutes this morning. In the 1970s, it would have
    been days of film neg opaquing and reversing with even more time doing camera
    ready art, followed by:\r\nReverse board art and come back as Pantone 123, surprint
    layer B as Pantone 456 printed last. Print layer C first as Pantone 789 and Spread
    to trap. Do not choke hairlines on overlay A. Dull varnish board art and Reprint
    layer A as gloss varnish. Must see composite proof before printing.  See you at
    press check...\r\n\r\nBest wishes and continued success, Jos!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    Yes Chris, but it would have been something different. And it would have involved
    a kind of work which maybe wouldn't have been merely \"routine\", since you could
    have changed your mind while working on it.\r\n\r\nI no longer like the overall
    feeling of letters built by an excess of basic geometry. That's why I'm still
    struggling with some of my experiments\u2026 :-)"

    It was a different world but still an exciting world of discovery--different than
    today but with the same opportunities if you looked for them ;-)
