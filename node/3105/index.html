A pile of boards to work on with the studio manager giving you deadlines like &quot;I need this by 10, the next one by 10:20, after that make sure this one is done by 11:15&quot;. Pretty much like that all day long. <BR> <BR>As to knives, I was a single edge razor blade man myself. After I &quot;caught &quot; by my Xacto knife as it rolled off my desk.  Single edge blades were the best, you could put them in your mouth while you adjusted something on the board, and you always knew where they were. <BR> <BR>As to Rapidograph pens. They were actually high-tech if you started out using a ruling pen.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One of my first gigs was helping out on a liberal weekly paper back in Anchorage in the 70s, at which my mother was a contributing editor. I mostly pasted in corrections. They operated on a shoestring and we hated to send out for corrections, so I spent a lot of time cutting out words, rearranging them, and rejustifying lines by hand. I also got good at making n's out of h's, or h's out of n's and l's &ndash; that sort of thing. <BR> <BR>I was an X-acto man, myself. Still am. And James, I used to stash mine behind my ear while I was working &ndash; hey, what can I say? I was young, brash, and reckless. <BR> <BR>I still have my handy pica pole over on my cutting board and I still enjoy using my 00 rapidograph. <BR> <BR>I do miss those days, sometimes. But I don't miss spec'ing type and casting off with c/p tables and a calculator. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I spent the first ten years or so of my career in the paste up era. One of my early jobs was doing paste-up (also known in the midwest at the time as keylining) at a weekly newspaper in Minneapolis. Even later as an art director I did it quite a bit, but often worked with someone else who did most of it.  <BR> <BR>Even though I was pretty good at it, I don't miss it at all. I would never go back. Think about it: You were mainly trying to get things to be straight and square. With computers, it requires a deliberate, conscious decision to make things crooked. Straight and square is automatic. Overnight, T-squares and triangles became obsolete. Good riddance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, the good old days, the depilatory effects of waxing machines, minor operations carried out with scalpels, making scalpel &quot;blades&quot; out of tracing paper and tossing them to colleagues, studio juniors being sent for a long weight while the experienced types carried out their black arts. You never forget the first time a scalpel slid off the drawing board and landed in your thigh. But the old timers would tell you how easy you had it compared to the molten metal splashes from Ludlow machines. So much physical pain was replaced by crashing computers and waiting half an hour for a colour laser print only to discover that it had pixellated the type. Still like to get the scalpel and the rotring pen out though.</div>
