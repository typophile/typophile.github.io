  body: "From the letter's shape it looks like an old dot-matrix printer font and
    if this is the case you should not expect to find an exact match of a modern outline
    digital font. I suggest to look for some similar monospace font like e.g. <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=FontShop&ffam=MagdaClean%20-%20Regular&fstyle=&fsize=60&fid=9e5c10122548486d7db924d6256ac2fd&wrap=2&text=101%20MILAN%20COURT%20A3134221|Magda
    Clean]]</strong> by FontFont\r\n"

  body: "If you are mainly interested in the digits you could try <strong>[[http://lineto.com/The%20Fonts/Font%20Categories/Text%20Fonts/Akkurat/|Akkurat-Mono]]</strong>\r\nor
    even <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/masterfont/galileo/|Galileo MF (Light)]]</strong>
    but the letters will be totally off (and not monospaced) in the later.\r\n"
