  | Myfonts]] and [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/gatf/pittsburgh | Fontspring]].\r\n\r\nPittsburgh
  is the latest (as at August 2011) in a range of inter-war American inspired commercial
  faces, and takes its place alongside the popular Bettendorff and the Spargo family.
  \ These shaded stab-serif capitals speak of the heyday of heavy manufacture and
  engineering and bring a gritty feel of the 20s and 30s to any project. Why not indulge
  in a little heavy engineering today?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pittsburgh_3474.png]"
