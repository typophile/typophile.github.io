  this font (the one that \"producer\" is written) long time ago, and fell in love
  with it... i had tried then to find it... but the closest one i found was a free
  and with poor quality (<a href=\"http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=267\">Astronaut</a>).\r\n\r\nIf
  you know exactly the name of the font that it is used in the cd covers of LTJ Bukem...
  you will draw a smile in a man's face :o)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanx in advance for any
  info.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers. "
