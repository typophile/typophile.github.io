Its interesting how the perception of Halloween has changed. My mother was really into the holiday and we would go to great measures to make a spooky fun place for the kids and the adults. One thing we would do is put fish nets hanging from the ceiling of the dinning room and put streamers draped through the holes. This gave the room the look of a magical forest. We also always had hot chocolate and apple cider for the adults who were almost always outside and never invited into a house. Not at my mothers place, the parents were incouraged to come in and enjoy the event. We would get hundreds of visitors when some neighbors would only get a few. A fun time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are some nice Halloween images <a href="http://oldhaunts.blogspot.com/">here</a>, mostly from the 60s and 70s. One of my favorites is the <a href="http://oldhaunts.blogspot.com/2005/07/drink-up.html">Bloodweister</a> image. 

For a few hears, Halloween kind of lost its charm for me. My mom isn't much of a party planner, and the same goes for me. But recently, I've begun to feel excited again about putting on a costume. If people are planning to dress up, I want to know what everyone's costumes are!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well in England Halloween is a pain. The trick treat knockers are usually older and scary they come a day too early. I had a girl come to my door on Oct 30 and say trick or treat. She was about 16. I looked at her and said 'you're a day early'. She said 'it's my religion.' and then I said 'go back to school, it's tomorrow' and shut the door. Other years if you were home and didn't answer the door you will get you door egged!!!! And It is very hard to get dry egg off a wood door...I now hate this commercial American crap holiday. It use to be fun.</div>

On my recent trip back to the old country I noticed that the trashy  Halloween trappings have made the leap across the Atlantic - which is a shame. It would never have happened under John Major's leadership (I moved in 1997). They also have three Starbucks in Leicester! But that's another story. 

As I will never be able to afford to move back I'm stuck in Seattle where the Halloween trash and Starbucks belong - as an added bonus we have trolloween too!

		<div class="commentbody">In St. Louis, the tradition is for kids to tell a joke or do a trick before receiving candy. This is how I celebrated the holiday all through childhood, and would begin thinking of the perfect joke the first of October.
Years later, I moved to Lawrence, Kansas. When Hallowe'en came, I was excited to have the holiday in this new town. I got everything ready for kids to come to the door, and when the bell rang with the first trick-or-treater, I opened the door eagerly.
"Trick or treat..." the four year old said, with trepidation.
"What's your trick?" I asked, expectantly.
"Huh?" he replied.
"Do you have a joke or something?" I encouraged.
"No..."
"Well, you have to tell me a joke or it's just begging,"

The kid started to cry.

No other kids had jokes that night, either.

It wasn't until the next day that I related the story to friends and was informed that the St. Louis tradition of telling jokes or doing tricks wasn't practiced in Kansas. Or in any other city I've lived in since. Very disappointing.</div>
