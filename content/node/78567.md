body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the correct kerning of the lining numeral '1'?
  Specifically, correct kerning when a sans-serif face whose '1' is simply a stem
  (dangerously close to an uppercase 'I' or lowercase 'l').\r\n\r\nThe context would
  be when old style figures aren't available however proportional spacing would be
  desirable, such as in body copy. \r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "IMO some space is required between 1 and the other numerals, even when kerning
    is possible.\r\nThese days, I provide proportional 1 with comfortable sidebearings.\r\nIf
    this space is not allowed for, numbers such as 1177 won't look right, because
    7_7 is always going to be very airy.\r\nThe 1_1 combination does require some
    negative kerning, however.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I kern all (proportional) numbers. As Nick says, they interact with other
    numbers. The first model I use is for folios, for a text running over 300 pages.
    The second is dates, as Nick mentions. They have to look good for both usages.\r\n\r\nAgain
    as Nick says, they need their space -- it is easy to kern 7_4 too tightly, then
    when you have 774, you have a mess.\r\n\r\nDon't forget punctuation, and such
    oddities as The Summer of '42"

  body: Thanks both for your thoughts on this. You're spot on Nick; looks like there's
    plenty of negative kerning afoot!

  body: "Oldstyle numerals may potentially have proportional spacing, and may be kerned
    in that case.\r\n\r\nNormally, lining numerals do not kern, and they are monospaced.
    This permits the setting of tabular material. This has, in the past, also applied
    to oldstyle numerals, so it should be followed as well in their case if they are
    not an alternate style in a given font.\r\n\r\nOf course, this applies to general
    purpose text typefaces only. A display typeface would not be used for the setting
    of tabular material."
