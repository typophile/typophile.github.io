  body: "I think Marc's suggestion was a good one. All that would have been needed
    is to modify the R to change the leg angle. Usually you would expect a trademark
    to be at least customized a certain amount to prevent simple copying of a brand
    identity. Johnston seems a perfect starting point, because the S is the right
    (unusual) shape, and the M and E are also not common and match quite well.\r\n\r\n-
