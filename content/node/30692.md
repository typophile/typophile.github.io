  body: I'm not sure if this will be of much assistance, but Hoefler & Frere-Jones
    have designed two very distinct signage typefaces for museums, <a href=http://typography.com/catalog/whitney/index.html>Whitney</a>
    (for NYC's Whitney Museum) and <a href=http://typography.com/catalog/verlag/index.html>Verlag</a>
    for NYC's Guggenheim. There's only a little bit in the site's descriptions about
    how they fit into museum signage, but it's something.

  body: "The type of museum might play a role in your design decisions. Legibility
    is probably first and foremost though. Consider that you will have people of all
    diferent heights (and eye strengths) trying to read at a fixed level. Larger than
    usual leading and point sizes over 16 help out in these areas. Museums are often
    surprisingly darker than you think of them to be also. \r\n\r\nThe Museum may
    have a style guide that they adhere to. The copy editor might be a good person
    to inquire about that with. Or inquire with the installation manager. They are
    often aware of what works and what doesn't in their particular galleries.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks you guys. some good info.\r\n\r\nThe typeface has been chosen. Garamond
    No. 3.\r\n\r\nanother question i have is...What's the best way to determine point
    size\r\non multi size information panels ranging from 2\"x3\" up to 8x16 feet.\r\nshould
    there be a system when upscaling type to bigger panels?\r\nOr should it be more
    intuitive, what feels right for each size pane.this would be for both copy size
    and headline.\r\n\r\nI would love to see more examples like this. and any more
    info. thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5761.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5_6318.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Confed-mem-hall-sign-IMG_41_4655.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DesignMuseumCafe_6160.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Holocaust-Hitler_6657.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/signage-wall_5033.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_4401.jpg]"
