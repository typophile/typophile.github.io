body: Hey everyone, I'm kinda at a last resort here. I've used font analysis survey
  to find font based on serif, non-serif, closed, open, fixed width, etc. I even emailed
  chevy themselves and all I got back was a "sorry, but we don't know, try googling
  it" response. I know I've seen fonts similar, especially w/the wider stroke on the
  left side of the letters, but couldn't find it in my library. Does anyone know the
  name of the font or even a direction to point me in. Any help with this is greatly
  appreciated, and I thank you all ahead of time for your time and consideration in
  helping me.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/66-76 Chevy_5832.jpg]

  body: "I did some looking for this and was not finding much that was unevenly weighted
    as this is. However, it seems that it would be easy enough to take any 'close'
    techno font and then move outline points to make selected parts of each letter
    fatter.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
