  body: I'd say it's too playful and cutesy and as such more fit, say, for a craftwoman's
    blog than a "strategy consulting". Also with its fancy glyph shapes it doesn't
    have a "simple" vibe to it. In other words it *is* unique though, but I'm afraid
    it's neither simple nor classy.

  body: looks like serifs have been randomly hacked off. Not sure what that really
    communicates...

  body: "Thanks @apankrat & @Special-k, the default typeface / Cypher is blunt, but
    wit the added kerning I think..it looks more broken. I assumed the rhythm of the
    terminals would come off as balanced,..atleast for \"Good\".\r\nWill work over
    it again\r\n"
