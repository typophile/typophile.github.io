body: "I hope I've posted this in the right location. I'm a desktop publishing hobbyist,
  and I've been asked to create a poster for a local nonprofit. I'd like to find a
  sans-serif font with a perfectly round capital G, thick letters (but not too thick),
  with a high crossbar. (Is that the right word for it?) This is for a fund-raising
  dinner, and my plan is to turn the G into a plate, and the crossbar into the shape
  of a fork.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations?\r\n\r\nJenel"

  body: Thanks for the suggestions. I like both of those. I also ran across Samosata
    NF, which has kind of a neat capital E that I could play with when creating the
    fork. But Samasota is so much cheaper (about $8) that it makes me wonder if something
    is wrong with it. Any feelings on that?

  body: By the way, in playing with the design, I no longer think I want a high crossbar.
    A lower crossbar makes the plate and fork look more like a G.

  body: Agenda is a very nice font, but it doesn't have the perfectly round G I'm
    looking for. Thanks for the reply, though!

    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/samosata-nf/?refby=mfde\">Samosata</a>
    is based on <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bernhard-gothic/alternate_cuts.html?refby=mfde\">Bernhard
    Gothic</a>. This old metal font has a couple of alternate characters. One can
    intersperse a line with those in order to establish a quirkier Art Deco look.
    Some digitizations of Bernhard Gothic also feature these extra glyphs, see <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bernhard-gothic/bern-got-book-alt/\">the
    Agfa/Monotype version</a>. For Samosata, Nick Curtis has merged all those alternates
    into one font. While the single-storey \u2018a\u2019 or the \u2018k\u2019 with
    its proudly exposed leg is nice, other characters are way too strange to work
    (as default forms): the uncial \u2018e\u2019, the ultra-narrow \u2018s\u2019,
    the \u2018z\u2019 with descender \u2026"
