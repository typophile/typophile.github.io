  body: well, it seems easier to critique ethiopian writing being fluent on it, but
    sadly it's not my case... :/ - anyway i have also very curious about these non-latin
    writings, like from ethiopian, armenian, georgian, etc. - anyway they seems to
    have a good balance among thin and thick strokes, but there seems the stroke edges
    at 5th and 6th characters are not too much defined as they are on the 3rd, which
    i don't know how intentional are them?
