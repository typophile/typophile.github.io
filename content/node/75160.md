  body: "Sweet indeed. Thanks.\r\nFWIW I think Knockout is an excellent choice for
    this \u2013 to my eye it manages to strike a rare balance between feeling both
    modern/DIN-ish and a bit retro/woodtype-y, if this makes any sense. Of course
    there are many more condensed sans-serifs, but anything you substitute will give
    a slightly different flavor\u2026 So if you're looking for alternatives, it'd
    help if you can say why, or <em>how</em> they should be different/similar."

  body: I completely agree and get what you are getting at. It is a beautiful "hybrid".
    I'm just looking for other possibilities that have a similar feel - modern but
    with a bit of a retro feel. It will be used for display text, all caps. Looking
    for something less mainstream than say Franklin Gothic, Trade Gothic or Helvetica.
    Thanks.
