body: "Last Saturday, after the match between Real Madrid and Barcelona, Madrid defender
  Sergio Ramos supposedly tweeted this (if you understand Spanish, you'll notice the
  involuntary joke). Ramos is famous for tweeting less than fortunate comments all
  the time \u2013so this could be legit\u2013, but this one looked fake, basically
  because of the type.\r\n\r\nIt looks like Georgia, which is used by many Twitter
  clients, but not quite. It's a bit rounder, thinner and with less contrast. Any
  thoughts on wether it is actually Georgia or something else?\r\n\r\nMany thanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ramos_5538.png]"

    distorted, mainly because it''s embedded as WebFont but that''s Georgia.'

    same thing twice.\r\n\r\nCan't look it up on the code because I have only seen
    it as a screen capture (it isn't on Ramos official account, although that could
    mean he deleted it at some point).\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks!"

  body: "No problem. This kind of fake is easy to do actually (using Chrome and a
    PC at least). Find [[https://twitter.com/SergioRamos/status/394207206339796992|a
    tweet]], right click it, inspect element, double-click element on elements panel
    and replace with your words. Printscreen. Done!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sr_5842.png]"
