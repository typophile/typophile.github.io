body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nJust wondering if there have been any revivals closely or
  loosely based on Caslon or Baskerville that include text, deck and display weights
  suitable for modern editorial design (print and digital)? \r\n\r\nI can think of
  Mrs. Eaves and Big Caslon but they are not robust enough in terms of weights.\r\n\r\nI
  think the answer is no but just want to make sure I am not missing something...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    are the display weights of Williams Caslon coming along, Bill Berkson?\r\n(I can\u2019t
    recall whether FB has published them yet.)"

  body: "But Baskerville is transitional... and Bulmer is a Scotch Roman.\r\n\r\nAlthough,
    if I were going to hybridize Baskerville with another typeface, it wouldn't be
    Caslon - instead, I'd hybridize it with Century Expanded."
