body: "Hello everybody!\r\nI am in trouble with a three-typefaces combination.\r\nI
  have a logotype set in Gill Sans and I need a Sans Serif (for titles) and Serif
  (for texts) combination to work well with it.\r\nThe logotype will often cohabit
  near type creating a trio that should be interesting. It also should be fresh and
  actual.\r\n\r\nRequirements for these two typefaces are:\r\n- possibly designed
  by the same designer (not Eric Gill).\r\n- in contrast with the Gill Sans logotype
  (maybe in x-height or other).\r\n\r\nAny suggestion?\r\nThank you very much for
  your help!"

    upper/lower case.\r\nPart of Gill Sans is humanist (e.g. /a and /g), part is geometric
    (e.g. /o and /w). \r\nThat is signi\uFB01cant.\r\n"

    body: "@Nick Shinn:\r\nReally proper observation! My mistake!\r\n\r\nLetters are
      all lower case and we have, alphabetical order: \"e\", two \"o\" (really distinctive
      feature as we are talking about Gill Sans), \"n\" and finally \"z\". There are
      also two \"N dashes\".\r\nSo the entire vision appears more geometric than humanist.
      \r\n\r\nI also need to specify that Gill Sans glyphs have been modified rendering
      the \"o\" more circular (less mashed) and thickness contrasts less marked (for
      \"n\" and \"e\")."

      for a pair of typefaces: a Sans Serif and a Serif both designed by the same
      designer (possibly authoritative in the world of typography but not Eric Gill).
      This pair of typefaces have to work well with the Gill Sans geometric logotype.\r\n\r\nThank
      you in advance for your interest! :-)"

  body: Possible choices of Optima, Hypatia, Avenir, Frutiger, or Formata for titles.
    Palatino looks good with Gill Sans and many of the other choices. Want something
    different in a serif look at Bramley.

    body: "@bojev\r\n\r\nHello Bojev,\r\nabout your Frutiger suggestion I initially
      considered Univers... But Frutiger actually shares more glyph shapes with Gill
      Sans than Univers (e.g. \"e\", \"a\", \"t\") so can be an interest solution
      for the Sans Serif.\r\nWhat do you think about marry it with a Meridien Serif
      for texts?\r\n\r\nAbout the other typefaces you mentioned I need time to value
      the combination with Gill Sans.\r\nI would immediately rule out the Optima as
      not related to the world of communication/design/technology to which this brand
      belongs.\r\n\r\nThank you for your suggestions!"

  body: Meriden Serif is just crisp enough that it might work well in this context.
    It is a nice face with enough weight to have impact. Good thought.

    body: "Ok Bob,\r\nin my personal opinion:\r\n\r\n- Hypatia and Avenir: the contrast
      with Gill Sans is too short.\r\n- Bramley: interesting but I am not sure to
      be able to use it appropriately in the context.\r\n\r\n- Formata: this is very
      interesting\u2026it has an own strong character! I didn't know this typeface
      before.\r\nAlso it works well with the Palatino you suggested so this can be
      a second interest combination (despite they were not designed by the same designer)!"

    Gill Sans (geometrical logo) + Frutiger (titles) + Meridien (texts)\r\n- Gill
    Sans (geometrical logo) + Formata (titles) + Palatino (texts)\r\n\r\nDo you think

  body: "The way you describe the logo, it sounds pretty generic.\r\nYou could use
    anything to go with it.\r\nThe proviso is that they should work together and the
    overall effect should suit the business.\r\nYou should trust your judgement and
    \uFB01nd faces that you would like to work with, or ones that you have already
    worked with and are comfortable with.\r\n\r\nDo you have any ideas about the relationship
    between body and titling faces that you would like to explore? Presumably the
    body is U&lc, but will the heads be regular or bold, U&lc or all caps? And how
    much bigger than the body? What about subheads? Are you going for an open leading
    spec or tight? Narrow or wide columns? Ragged or justi\uFB01ed? Why are separate
    faces required for heads and body? How will captions &c. be handled?\r\n\r\nHow
    is it possible to choose a typeface without taking these parameters into consideration?\r\n\r\n"

    body: "@ Nick Shinn\r\n\r\nYou are right, I realize that is difficult to give
      advices without having a look at the logo and knowing its intrinsic values.
      I tend to simplify because I already have these parameters in mind and already
      have quite clear ideas. Obviously I find it hard to transfer these values \u200B\u200Bhere
      on the forum only by text...but I actually can not publish the logotype and
      nothing else related to it.\r\nI will ask you an opinion on the finished work
      then! \r\nMeanwhile, thank you!"
