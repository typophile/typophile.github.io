body: "My dad's asked me to create a website for his law firm (only two lawyers),
  and the first thing they want to do is create a new logo. They don't currently have
  a \"logo\" per se, but simple text used on their letterheads. \r\n\r\nHere are a
  couple of the ideas I've been working on. I don't want to just have a plain text
  logo, so I tried my hand at an accompanying symbol/image. I couldn't come up with
  anything original that related to law/lawyers, only a gavel and the scales of justice
  images which are incredibly overused.\r\n\r\nAny ideas where I can go from here?\r\n\r\nTheir
  areas are: divorce law, criminal defense, civil litigation and personal injury.
  The firm name is King & Lloyd, P.A.\r\n\r\nI want the logo to be simple, clean and
  portray professionalism, trustworthiness, and success (?). "

    you're on the right track here. I'd be playing with some letterforms in a monogram
    context much like you're doing. I'd be staying the hell away from scales and gavels,
    too. :) Keep at it."

  body: "I rather like sample1; it's classy without being stereotypically stuffy.
    I like the contrast between the sans-serif text and the fancier ampersand, and
    I think the text meshes nicely with the colored blocks.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ampersand
    seems a bit off center to me... maybe you could move it to the right a bit? It
    feels like 'Lloyd' is all by itself there.\r\n\r\nAlso, the small serif text on
    the bottom doesn't fit quite right to me. I think you should stay with a serif
    font, but that particular one seems a bit too plain perhaps.\r\n\r\nI hope that
    helps. Good luck!"

    a law firm, people are expecting to think 'established' 'reliable'\r\nrather than
    'modern' \r\n\r\nalso, i missed sleeping last night\r\n\r\n$0.02"

    to me.

  body: "#1 - but it needs pushing. The two panels - try distorting the perspective
    of the panels with perhaps the initials of both lawyers. Something to relate to
    the type.\r\n\r\nI think the colors work. But not with such a bold, black font.
    Try using shades of black or to soften it with a blue black. For me, it is not
    appearing too friendly.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would be using a + sign between the
    names. But that's just me.\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n"

  body: of the two, the first works better. but i don't have any idea what the offset
    squares have to do with law. i'm sure you don't want the squares to represent
    your father and his law partner! lose the squares...
