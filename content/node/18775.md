  headlines in Frame Magazine (www.framemag.com).\r\n\r\nI can't find it anywhere,
  maybe it's a customized font for the magazine's use only..? \r\n\r\nThanks in forehand,\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: Mike, is it possible to scan a page from the magazine, because the cover on
    the website is tiny.

      body: Hi Mike - download the media kit pdf from the site - the fonts used in
        that are listed - loads of them - a real type salad as we used to call it.
        I think the one you mean is Herman's Zapf International. Chris Mitch

  body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nThis thread is old but I can fulfil the request.\r\n\r\nFrame
    use a font called Scotch Modern. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern]].\r\n\r\nExample
    here in the mag:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0024_5288.JPG]\r\n\r\nThey
    use a second typeface for headlines that I can't recognize (light and bold sanserifs
    ones in the image):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0026_3864.JPG]\r\n\r\nCan
    someone identify it ?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nCarlos."
