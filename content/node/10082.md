  body: 'This question is a bit of a sticky wicket. How much text do you need to set?
    If it isn&#39;t more than a paragraph, you could always use pen, paper and photocopier.
    Just teasing. I believe that FontLab has 30 day trial versions that might get
    you started. You might look at their comparison page and perhaps find that you
    don&#39;t need FontLab and can make due with one of their other software packs.
    You could also scour ebay for a copy of something used, Fontographer for instance.
    Unfortunately, to make quality typefaces isn&#39;t something that can be done
    for free. <BR> <BR>Downloads: <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/Font-utilities/Try-out-FontLab-Products/"

  body: There is one free program that handles TrueType/OpenType &#40;including Kerning,
    etc.&#41; <BR> <BR>FontForge, a simple google search will find it.  It is very
    difficult to get set up and working on a Windows system &#40;it was designed for
    Linux&#41;, and is not the most intuitive design program I&#39;m sure.  I have
    not yet started to work on hinting/instructing the font&#39;s I&#39;ve made in
    it, but it does seem to be capable of hinting.  It can export both OpenType and
    Apple specific Kerning data in TrueType Fonts, and it can handle glyph substitutions
    as well &#40;though I have yet to use this&#41;.  It can also export to other
    font formats besides TrueTypes.  I can&#39;t say how good a quality font you can
    make with it &#40;I am not a professional font designer&#41;, but I have already
    created my own handwriting font with it, and I&#39;m working on a Times New Roman
    style Serif font.

    That was my first reaction too. <BR> <BR>If you want to make quality fonts, I&#39;d
    suggest investing time and alas, money in a class from somebody who knows what
    they&#39;re doing. I see you are not too far from new york city. Type Director&#39;s
    Club offers a masterclass on type design over 4 saturdays &#40;intro to drawing
    glyphs&#41;, see <a href="http://www.tdc.org" target="_blank">www.tdc.org</a>.
    SVA offers several type related options &#40;but coming down for a semester on
    weekdays might be an issue&#41; <a href="http://www.sva.edu" target="_blank">www.sva.edu</a>.
    <BR> <BR>Without spending money, you can get some type education by visiting:

      it's still not ready, check out the <strong>Document Section on How to Install
      Fontforge on Windows, OSX or Fedora Linux.</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typeforge.net/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=4&id=24&Itemid=31\">

      how to (start to) Type Design featuring the whole sketch-to-digital typeface
      . For now, Akzidenz revival - we are currently sketching...\r\n\r\nActually,
      I think using Open Source software is the best way to learn  some subjects (like
      Typography and Webdesign) and to motivate people to push forward. Otherwise
      people tend to stick to the available commercial solutions... and sometimes
      fail to see the true principles of the art/craft behind the software mask. Even
      if sometimes Open Source software is quirky, technicaly challenging and hard
      to master...\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you do want to take it to the professional
      level you should use professional level editor like Fontlab. You shouldn't go
      for the $50 solutions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPedro\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typeforge.net\">www.typeforge.net</a>"

  body: "Caspar, stay tuned for Fontographer for OS X. It is presently in Beta, and
    works pretty much exactly as it always has. (Using it is like stepping back in
    time. Very odd sensation.)\r\n\r\nI heartily recommend FontLab, which is the Concorde
    to Fontographer's Sopwith Camel. Which is purely my opinion; some people swear
    by RoboFog, which is a Python-fueled version of an even older generation of Fontographer.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a \"diet\" version of FontLab called TypeTool, which might be the right tool
    for someone wanting to try on the FontLab editing environment. And it only costs
    $99.\r\n\r\nFontLab makes all of the above-mentioned sotware, and they do a great
    job. \r\nhttp://www.fontlab.com/\r\n\r\nOh, and I forgot to say: You can download
    trial versions of their software, so you can get the applications for free, but
    there will be limits when you generate the fonts."
