I think <em>two</em> pages in Helvetica is pushing it.

Why would they spec that? Sounds like a great start to an
exposé on how non-type-people make such determinations.

My guess the gig has been assigned to some graphic design office in Sao Paulo and someone there thinks it's fun to read an academic text, full of all sort of citations, dates, notes, references etc. in Helvetica. Plus such a Modernist type for a conference on Urban planning history when we should be  trying harder to distance ourselves from all the damages that such an ideology has produced in terms of town planning. A bad choice in many aspects. Brazilian architects, designers and planners are still very much attached to all things Modern.</div>

Chris, I was in grad school in the mid 70s.

I remember paying 75¢ a page for simple text and a $1 a page for any sort of "tabular" material.

Of course, you had to get most pages re-typed after the thesis committee finished their mark-up.

What I mean is, people have their preferences for many reasons, and who is to say that those who prefer Helvetica don't do so for quite non-artistic reasons?

I'm sure that's true, but I really don't think neutrality should really be a factor of consideration in this context. It's still just a stylistic issue and a matter of preference, whereas Legato is designed for an optimal reading experience (for a sans, anyway) regardless of whether you like the design. In that regard, Hrant is not an artiste for recommending Legato.</div>

In my experience people recommend Helvetica usually because
their teacher (who is often in a certain age group...) impressed its

22 huh. Good for you, the world is before you. Chris and my remembrances of grad school are most definitely from the pre-personal computer era. I wrote my thesis on 5x7 inch note cards either in the library or at the bar with a pitcher of beer. The typist was the 2nd best paid girl (always female) in town.</div>

I'm not really advocating for Helvetica (having once given a talk titled <em>Death to Helvetica</em>), however, I do think that the motivations of people who spec it are sincere, although misguided. And of course, Max Miedinger and all the others who have contributed to the grotesque genre have been just as much committed to the ‘optimal reading experience’ as Evert Bloemsma. No one has the high ground just because they say so and have a clever theory.</div>

I've been mentored by Joop Ridder in my type design, whom has been mentored by Gerrit Noordzij, Joop often talked about the old ways of doing typography (he did only one or two typefaces in his career so he was more of a typographer and graphic designer) in a manner which made it sound both magical and tedious. There's something to be admired for the craft and manual work that was involved, but I'm glad I can skip that part. However due to this lack of insight in the old methods I think many of us youngsters are getting both cocky and ignorant.</div>

I know you aren't, but I don't see a point in defending people's sincere reasons for using a typeface when you yourself admit they're misguided. I mean, what point are you trying to make exactly?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Are they really asking to submit papers in Swis721 or are they just providing Word templates using Swis721?

I searched and found this conference, the <a href="http://www.fau.usp.br/15-iphs-conference-sao-paulo-2012/abstracts-and-papers.html">15th IPHS Conference</a> in São Paulo. What I found is Word templates so that all submitted papers look about the same when they open them. They expect those submitting papers to replace the existing text and match the style. And indeed,  when I open the file 15IHPS-example.doc (for instance)  I see  that the font used is Swis721 Lt BT. That is misleading because I don't have that font on my computer, probably nobody else than the organizers does, and word will just apply some standard substitution for display; you can't rely on what you see on the screen to deduce what your text will look like in the proceedings. If I  save their file in pdf format on my Macintosh, the font that is embedded is Trebuchet. </div>
