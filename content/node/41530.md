    we're taking volunteers. Care to join up, Nick?"

    at Magelaan four days a week, writing and maintaining the Unzipped blog for FontShop
    Benelux and doing freelance graphic design and writing I now also teach Digital
    Lay-out on Wednesday mornings. And I still play drums in pop/rock band Troubleman,
    with our second album due in April.\r\n\r\nThe current workload kinda messes up
    my (x)-quota. ;^)"

  body: Yeah, but we're just in the process of doing our MySpace page and website
    properly. That's just a test page by our fearless leader (the songs on there aren't
    even the mastered versions).

    if we let the original poster check off a box that says (s)he considers the question
    solved, even if that means a close (enough) approximation was suggested. That
    can use the Edit permissions that exist already, so only the originator (or a
    moderator) can call it closed. \r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: Troubleman is nice. I'm getting flashbacks to early european underground indie
    acts like Velour 100 and the The Lassie Foundation, though it's a tad bit of Coldplay
    in there.

    the loop for a while so I haven't got a clue how this will shape up. I'll keep
