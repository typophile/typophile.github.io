  of big cities but it seems harder to find than i thought.\r\nWith graphical identity
  of a city i mean: their logo and the different applications (even a slogan?)\r\nI
  really can't believe there's nothing to find on this topic!\r\nwho can help me out? "

    FontFeed</a>.\r\n\r\nOle Sch\xE4fer and Erik Spiekermann's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11230.0.0\">FF
    Govan</a> is based on the acclaimed type concept developed for Glasgow 1999 City
    of Architecture and Design. The Glasgow fonts were reworked by Sch\xE4fer and
    extended to include three widths each of six variations plus dingbats. The strength
    of the family lies in the innovative manner in which the three widths, two ascender
    heights, two descender lengths and dingbats can be combined. The results are striking
    and offer a unique way to create emphasis in a sentence or even within a single
    word. The expert sets also include a large selection of ligatures that represent
    the most common letter combinations in English, German and French. With FF Govan
    type setting becomes type sculpting."
