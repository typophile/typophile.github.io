  body: Oh, I see that someone has already posted a link to this. Ah, if only the
    Typophile search engine actually worked! I did look for 'keming' before posting,
    but found nothing.

  body: "I use google. Type your terms, then \"site:typophile.com/node\" without quotes.
    Works like a charm. \r\n\r\nI auto-kemed a font once."

  body: "Yes, but even Google can index the site only every so often, so if someone
    posts a link to keming now and I do a search for it within the day, it might not
    show up and lead to duplicate posts. That\u2019s rather unfortunate, but apart
    from complaining I don\u2019t think we can do much about it."

  body: Google seems to have a lag about 6 hours or so. It has my previous comment,
    but not yours.
