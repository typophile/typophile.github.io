  For example take Garmound and make it look like it went through a washer 100 times.
  Thanks

  body: "If you want to create your own custom weathered beaten textured type here's
    one of my ways to do it with Photoshop.\r\n\r\nDetermine what kind of weathered
    beaten texture you want for the type, like wood grain, brick, plaster etc., and
    use an image of that texture to texture the type. In this example I chose a coarse
    plaster painted texture...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FakeTypeTexture_3845.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nDesaturate
    the image and take it into Image>Adjustments>Levels and try to emphasize the qualities
    of the texture, (ie. shadows and midtones and highlights). Then go over to Select>Color
    Range and from the Select drop down menu select which ever option will best describe
    the weathered texture to be applied to the type - I chose to layer the Color Range
    of the Shadows and Midtones but tossed in some Highlights just to add more depth
    to the texture. \r\nWith the Color Range selected go to Edit>Define Brush name
    it and save it. Grab the Eraser Tool and from the tool's option mode select Brush
    and from the Brushes palette select the texture that was just saved and use this
    Eraser Tool brush to texturize weather the font, and try adjusting the opacity
    of the Eraser Tool brush to get a feel of the texture.\r\n\r\nAlthough the edges
    of faded and weathered type are seen as stressed and deteriorated, there seems
    to be more fade and weathering within the edges of the type. \r\nTo create this
    effect, merge the textured type layers and duplicate the layer, select the type,
    feather the selection, and delete the selection, (also, try contracting the selection
    then feathering). Save what remains as a brush, and use this brush to build back
    up the edges of the font. This brush can be further enhanced too. \r\n\r\nHope
    you enjoy my weather beaten textured type technique. \r\n\r\n________\r\nHiro "
