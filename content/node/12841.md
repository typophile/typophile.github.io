  for my first school project about typeface design. I started following the execellent
  tutorial 'intro to typeface design 110', but then the new version of typophile came
  up and the tutorial is now unvailable, so I was wondering if anyone have a local
  copy of it or an alternate link?\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nSoren "

      and thus not straight forward to archive, I'm dropping you an email.\r\n\r\nThanks
      a lot!"
