  was established in 1993, primarily as a vehicle to distribute some of the first
  typeface designs created for Raygun magazine. From the beginning, GarageFonts has
  always been on the cutting edge of new typeface design. It started as a small library
  of trend setting designs and continues to grow into a varied collection of original,
  accessible text and display typefaces.\r\n\r\nGarageFonts is now owned and maintained
  by [[Phils Fonts]].\r\n\r\n<strong>External Links</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.garagefonts.com/\">GarageFonts.com</a>\r\n<a
