<div class=commentbody>Evidence: as usual in matters typographic, nothing good. So we're left with thought, and it seems to indicate that serifs help because they provide more info, including directional info (think of the tops of "b" and "d" for example).

<div class=commentbody>You might, but then... The thing to remember about dyslexia is it can't be "solved" by making a new typeface or by using a specific typeface in one place. I certainly have sympathy for people with extreme dyslexia, but you can't re-make the world, with all its magazines, fine print, illuminated signs, motion graphics, airport and city navigations, in a way that resolves the difficulty dyslexics have in reading.
Which is more useful to a dyslexic: a typeface used in 2 places, or new methods for reading they can apply everywhere? </div>

<div class=commentbody>It's probably a mistake to draw a line between them and us.
All one can say is that there are varying kinds of reading ability, and varying degrees.
Go to your local library or bookstore and look in the large print section, and see what kinds of typefaces are being used. This shows what people who have some difficulty reading prefer. Of course, being short-sighted and being dyslexic are different, but it can be argued that large print helps both -- in particular because large print is also used for another group of people who don't read fluently: children learning.
For young reader books, the practice changed from serif to sans serif during the second half of the 20th century. Has this had any effect on overall literacy? Probably not.
At the RNIB website, they don't have a preference between sans or serif. </div>

I know it's been said, but I think it's worth repeating...what is in widespread use is simply indicative of what's in widespread use...not necessarily what people PREFER. We live in a society where user preferences are not necessarily a sign of market penetration.
I think the only viable text-research I've heard was the statement 'we read best what we read most' implying that as humans, we're comfortable with what we're most familiar with. That rings true for pretty much anything...not just type design.
Of course, the problem is that everyone is different, so it somewhat prevents us from making viable broad generalizations.</div>

In a way yes, but it's also probably a mistake to lump different groups together! The problems that dyslexics have are pretty specific, so it's different than people who simply have blurry vision, or children who have yet to move from deliberative to immersive reading.

Everything has an effect, all of the time, on everybody.

In other words, people who learned with sans aren't any less or more literate than those who learned with serif -- if indeed there were any way to make a measurable connection between sans/serif and the literacy rate.</div>

There's no reason to believe that "people who learned with sans aren’t any less or more literate than those who learned with serif", and there is in fact reason to believe the opposite. We can argue about which is better, sans or serif, but they could never be equally good/bad at everything, or really anything.

I'm completely ignorant on the topic, but I imagine someone is focusing on aiding dyslexics to improve their reading performance. If nobody is studying this, yet there are untrained students developing special typefaces for dyslexics, then something's not working.
"This shows what people who have some difficulty reading prefer."
We've been over this already. This shows what designers or publishers <strong>think</strong> children or the elderly prefer. The jury's still out on what they actually prefer. And their stated preference isn't the same as what they read most easily.</div>

Well, let me rephrase "readers' preference": The type in large-print books shows what works in the marketplace, as with any publishing genre. I would imagine that publishers conduct focus groups from time to time, try out a sans serif, get negative feedback, and stick with the old workhorses.</div>

I would say that in this case, as it's impossible to measure, the difference is meaningless.
And if it were possible to measure, I would guess that the differenece would be statistically negligible.
But I'm strangely attracted to your chaos-theory existentialism, Mr Everything Matters.</div>

No, no, it wouldn't be impossible to measure because the difference is too small, but because not everything can be measured, or at least not everything will be.
It's ironic how apparently empiricism is good or bad depending on how well it guards the shores of Shinnistan.

The assumption seems to be that English spelling and grammar is too tricky, but alphabetic distribution in Italian might also be a factor.
Luc de Groot has figured out the most common character pairs for different languages. It would be interesting to compare English and Italian in that light, with regard to reading difficulty.

I thought we were discussing the rate of literacy, i.e. what percentage of the population is considered literate.

Well, that's what he demonstrated in a talk in Montreal last month that I attended, so perhpas he was mischaracterizing himself? (As usual, you seem to know more about people than they do themselves, even when you weren't even there.)
Luc has been looking into removing automatically generated kern pairs from font tables, where the characters don't appear in the same language, and has analyzed the frequency of character combinations in different languages, with software that trolls texts -- he takes a variety from newspapers, magazines and books -- to record that information. This is a subject which you, he, and I discussed (if my memory serves me) at the Boston AtypI conference many years ago, and he has followed through.</div>

And yes, it was in Boston (in 1999). Live and learn I guess.

<div class=commentbody>Wow: 2 parallel threads. I had thought we were discussing reading abilities of dyslexics.
"This is a different matter from dyslexia": Thank you William, this is an important point ignored in the Read Regular project. Issues such as "infant" characters, mirroring, and a host of hopeful hyperbole are conflated in the thesis to support the results, which I find simply fail to satisfy basic criteria for type for even general readers. Since the [also presumed] advantage of infant characters is based on a developmental stage in learning to read, and dyslexics might just as easily not be at that developmental stage, it's of questionable use there. From the website:
"The characters have been stripped down from all unnecessary details –such as a two storey a and a two eyed g."
But what about those helpful feet on the bottom that carry the eye along like a wheelbarrow? ; )</div>

I think everyone has more difficulty reading all caps. We all use word shapes to some degree.

<div class=commentbody>I'd say that a graphic designer would make a poor candidate for such a test, actually, as he would be much more aware of the font than a layman.
There certainly is an absence of real data; all I know of is anecdotal evidence. It should be noted, too, that just because this one guy picks up on wordshapes doesn't mean that's how all dyslexic people operate.
As an aside, I've noticed that my dyslexic friends seem to be better at three-dimensional spatial tasks than two-dimensional. Again, purely anecdotal. Might the two ideas be interrelated though?</div>

That's not the part I was repeating. I understand your point that large type is not in any way a fix for dyslexia.
The point I was repeating was the common assumption we often make that market share somehow is an indicator of end-user preferences.

Well, if you're going to get all repetitious, may I draw your attention to a comment I made at the top of this thread:
"being short-sighted and being dyslexic are different, but it can be argued that large print helps both — in particular because large print is also used for another group of people who don’t read fluently: children learning."
And also:
"there are varying kinds of reading ability, and varying degrees."
If you can read fluently, you can read "normal" or small text (say, 8 to 12 pt). If you can't, <em>for whatever reason,</em> then you need something larger. </div>

Thanks for the empirical corroboration, William. However, I can't claim any credit for divining that, as my hypothesis was based on assumptions about the marketplace. I just found it inconceivable that in a competitive segment of the publishing industry, that publishers would not conduct focus groups, or be aware of the reading issues, or not try different type treatments, in an attempt to sell more product. And so the standard that has become established -- as with news text -- may be considered to represent the kind of product that readers prefer, and is not just a style foisted on them by a monolithic industry. In that sense, it's similar to newspaper text type, extremely conservative in its adherence to certain sizes and styles, and woebetide any typographer who deviates too greatly from the norm.
A scenario I'm familiar with is where a newspaper is redesigned and a focus group (or the readers in the letters page) say a particular type spec is too small. Of course, the type is not smaller, the readers just don't like it, or aren't prepared to make the adjustment to become familiar with it.
One interesting aspect of large print is book size: it seems that readers like a normal-sized book (although it will, of course, be thicker). I suspect this is for social and cultural reasons, or maybe even the size in their hands for ease of page turning. In the study you cite, participants were kept at a distance of 40 cm from the text -- so I wonder, what if they had used smaller text, but a closer distance?! In other words, the typographic factors -- numner of words per line and page -- may be quite significant.</div>

From the wikipedia:
"A (fallacious) ad hominem argument has the basic form:
1. A makes claim X.
2. There is something objectionable about A.
3. Therefore claim X is false.
"The first statement is called a 'factual claim' and is the pivot point of much debate. The last statement is referred to as an 'inferential claim' and represents the reasoning process. There are two types of inferential claim, explicit and implicit.
"Ad hominem is one of the best-known of the logical fallacies usually enumerated in introductory logic and critical thinking textbooks. Both the fallacy itself, and accusations of having committed it, are often brandished in actual discourse (see also Argument from fallacy). As a technique of rhetoric, it is powerful and used often, despite its inherent incorrectness.
"In contrast, an argument that instead relies (fallaciously) on the positive aspects of the person arguing the case is known as appeal to authority."
And also your personal accusation is untrue. As you can see from this very thread, I change my mind in response to new evidence. And, as you can see here, I do seek out evidence that might contradict my views--as my teacher Popper urged.

How do you know?
To me, the state of knowledge of the mechanics of the reading process is so sketchy that everything is more by way of hints than a comprehensive understanding--including such issues as rhythm and influence of kinesthetic factors. This research is hints that they are important. How they affect learning to read and expert readers I don't know, but I don't see why they would affect both.

Yes, that seems axiomatic enough (although historical determinists may disagree).
I would assume you exercise your free will in making purchasing decisions?
An act of choice is, ipso facto, a demonstration of preference!
Of course, the choice may be limited (by oligopoly for instance) or skewed (e.g. by advertising, or industry standards). But I don't think that's the case with the market for easy-to-read books and large, serifed typefaces.

What I was thinking about as a counter example is the music industry. I saw a bumper sticker: "You're not getting older, the music really sucks".
The music industry has been taken over by lawyers with little musical taste, and promote those whom they imagine to be good. This doesn't get the best people promoted, in my view, or the best music to the public.
The point is that the internal forces of the music industry don't necessarily result in the external market for music working efficiently. 'Market imperfections' are a subject of study in Economics. One of the factors is the concentration of ownership, which distorts the market. Another is lack of information. And judging by the bogus claims to fonts good for dyslexia, there is a communication problem. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Large print books in fact have a very unusual market history. My friend and neighbor was a librarian for the handicaped, and told me the story. A wealthy English philanthropist started funding large print books for those with limited vision. He did this on a pretty massive scale, I believe, and it succeeded in getting into libraries all over. Obviously the people responded by using the large print books, but the market, I believe is still mainly libraries. And it may well be that it is still a philanthropic enterprise, not profit driven, and so not market at all in the traditional sense.
It seems that only recently have people found that large print can help in teaching those with dyslexia. So I suppose that market is growing. </div>

That's what I said Bill, oligopoly and ad skew. Of course the market is imperfect, and always has been, but it's the best thing available for choice and preference, the notion of which probably wouldn't exist without it, at least not to such an extent. As for the bogus claims to fonts good for dyslexia, I offer the market, imperfect though it may be, as a corrective to misinformation. If you look at the promotion of large print books, they don't hype the fonts on pro-dyslexic claims. They don't hype the fonts, period. It will be intereting to see what happens if and when the publishers get a little more of the readability BS in their arsenal, whether people will buy books set in some of the dubious pro-dyslexia fonts. I expect they will be foisted on children first.
<em>immersive reading</em>
As long as you continue to consistently promote the fallacy of immersive reading, we'll get nowhere. ALL reading is immersive. Readability is just fast legibility. Readability is just another term for good typography.

Great. Just so people know where you stand, so they -like me- can hopefully put your opinions about reading in the context of this basic ignorance. And this is of course why you couldn't design a functional Eunoia-Text; because the confusion between display and text fonts is part of this ignorance. The -drastic, pragmatic- mods necessary to make a text version from the display were beyond your understanding.
So Eben, Peter, everybody: please pay attention to where given
opinions are coming from, not just where they pretend to be headed.

(Always with the fake smile[ys].)
No, everybody is brainwashed to some extent, just some of us more, and most importantly: in different directions. These directions are what need to be considered in weighing the opinions of people about a topic, in filtering their advice, sometimes in fact leaving only a faint mist, not any usable water.

<div class=commentbody>Personally, I think your Comic Sans is one of the more readable screen fonts. And I can see that its off-the-vertical strokes might even help dyslexics--though I think the 'a' might give them problems, as noted.
But as a general matter, all of these sites recommend a series of fonts based on no research, i.e. systematic checking, as to whether their uninformed and unprofessional opinions actually have any basis. (Arial--no way.)
For example, here is a debunking of the 'research' on Tiresias:

Some good research on this issue would be great. But it doesn't seem to have been done. </div>

Well, I don't have any friends in libraries to fill me in.
I had a superficial look around online and found a variety of publishers, with links to Amazon, so I'm assuming a competitive retail market, as well as the institutional one you mention, which may well be the mainstay.
Best sellers such as Potter and Da Vinci Code are part of the large print market.
The large-print market breaks down into:
Public Libraries
Educators and School Libraries
Consumers (eg via Amazon)
Bookstores
Although I don't know the percentage split.</div>

No need to wonder, just ask him. Except wondering certainly works

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I think the answer to missgigles' question 'which is easily read' has to be neither. Neither seriffed type nor sanserif type is easily read by dyslexic persons.
It is tempting to take results such as those about type-size cited in the O'Brien, Mansfield, Legge paper linked by Bill, and simply make them parts of a piece-meal (and blindly scientistic) typographic response to dyslexia. I think this approach would be unfortunate.
To make progress, though, I think typophiles might benefit from critical engaement of discussions of reading difficulties <em>at the level the OM&L paper does</em>.
The OM&L paper explores the print size effect in terms of magnocellullar deficits and their impact, and then cites a <em>position coding deficit</em> as a possible cause for the size effect, bringing into the discussion, spatial frequency and lateral interference issues along the way. The paper is the most thorough exploration of these issues that I've seen to date.
I wasn't aware of the OM&L paper until I noticed William's link to it., but I had been exploring the possibility that the magnocellullar deficit which is typical of some dyslexics <em>impacts the perceptual learning necessary</em> for adult-level skilled reading to emerge. I've previously talked about this on typophile in terms of 'unitization' or in terms of the formation of an alternative to 'slot-processing' by letter identities, or in terms of adult level processing being 'bouma-based'. By contrast, what I've described as slot-processing relies on the 'what / where' letter identity + position coding referenced by OM&L as the crucial factor. 

In my 'typographical-craft-knowledge derived' scheme, perceptual learning puts in place a coding of the whole pattern of blacks and whites inside the bounded map of the word at a level more primitive than that of whole letters. So for me the magnocellullar deficit impacts the consolidation of a supercessionary perceptual processing routine reliant on these whole-word maps of sub-letter features. In the abscence of this perceptual processing skill, the reader with a magnocellullar deficit is thus forced to <em>rely</em> on a more error prone and slower slot-processing, with it's letter-identity + position encoding, and as OM&L suggest, this might indeed be more managable or less susceptible to lateral interference effects at larger sizes.
This might help us realize that, while larger print sizes might accommodate a perceptual processing deficit, they don't solve the underlying problem.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Peter, I think the information you cite in the paper increases the chance that a crucial test I suggested earlier would actually be telling.
I had suggested that in learning to read fluently there might be a transition from slot processing to whole word (or at least part word) pattern recognition. And this transition might be blocked in some dyslexics. So the test I suggested is to increase letter space to the point of word break-down, and then gradually tighten it. The idea is that for the beginning reader and dyslexic, the tighter letter space would be neutral or as you suggest actually detrimental. But for the expert reader the normally tight spacing would increase reading speed.
Perhaps one of the authors of the dyslexia paper might be interested in doing this?</div>

I think this is a safe assumption, but a primitive one.
The trick is figuring out why.

Such tests were suggested to Kevin in Thessaloniki for the purposes of testing general readability. But, for the nth time, the results will be irrelevant as long as lab conditions do not foster true immersion.
Once you have tests good enough to establish that "binding" letterspacing does have an effect on "normal" adult readers, you can then show that it has no/reduced effect on dyslexics. But you're still stuck with the Why.

The way science works is that each new step forward raises new questions. It is not being 'stuck' to moot a new important problem. If the experiment establishes that there is a new phenomenon to be explained, that is a step forward. You've discovered an important new fact, even if the theory is not settled. </div>

<div class=commentbody>"True" wasn't the best word here - I should call it "deep" immersion. And the difference between light and deep will seem strange, although I think it's necessarily pragmatic: the difference is what it would take for formal science (eg Kevin) to start admitting what's really going on! The existing testing does lurk in the area of light immersion, which is why you might see an "and" saccaded over, etc. But such minute exceptions are too rare to need to be addressed, apparently. In deep immersion the boumas will start coming out of the woodwork en masse, the parafovea fully revealing its true role, thus making it unfeasable to deny the truth. For this to happen, the testing needs to be good enough. A very easy way to tell if/when it becomes good enough is reading speed; tellingly, speeds are way too low right now.
Test results are irrelevant (at least towards marking improvements in text fonts) because when you're not deeply immersed, Nothing Matters. You just plod along, reading every letter carefully (although in parallel, so not as slowly as deliberative reading, like practiced by reading learners).
"Stuck" was (also) not the best word to use here. What I meant was that I think we already know that dyslexia isn't moving to deep immersion, and to mark improvement we have to understand why. On the other hand, I can see how formal "proof" of something would greatly help formal science start looking in the right direction.

<div class=commentbody>Reading speed. Kevin's tests max out at about 350 wpm or so.
My view is that it could be twice that in an experienced reader.

And if you don't facilitate deep immersion, the difference you will see will not reflect what's really going on - or I should say what really could be going on. Without deep immersion, Kevin's model holds 95% (which apparently is good enough). But Kevin's model is only half the story; the other half containing -among other things- the justification for serifs in readability.

You can't test now what 'could be' but isn't. That's ineffectual fantasy land.
>if you don’t facilitate deep immersion, the difference you will see will not reflect what’s really going on - or I should say what really could be going on.
Why don't you think it is possible to test without big speeds? Good tests magnify small effects--the Michelson-Morley experiment being a famous example. Lasers, including those in laser printers, magnify quantuum effects that you could never see otherwise...
In my suggested test, increasing spacing to breakdown and using beginning readers and dyslexics is intended to put a magnifying glass on the effects. If the idea that normally tight spacing helps the practice normal reader is correct, the differences should show up there.
Once verified that the difference exists, then further theory and tests could get deeper. </div>

You've misunderstood me.
I'm saying that if tests were good enough they would reveal much higher speeds, speeds at which experienced readers DO read when the lab coats aren't around.
> Why don’t you think it is possible to test without big speeds?
Because immersive reading, being essentially a subconsious activity, is primarily concerned with <cite>efficiency</cite>. It's like a wild animal looking for food - it doesn't pause to admire the flowers. If it's not going very fast, it's because it's hiding from hunters.
Asking people to "read normally" is a lot like asking people to
"breathe normally", which never results in normal breathing! :-)
> Good tests magnify small effects
Sure, but you have to be crossing over into the promised land first.
It's not all linear.

The wrong effect.

<div class=commentbody>Bill, I think a spacing test such as you describe could be especially telling in the O'Brien, Mansfield & Legge context of (partial mis-)interpretation, if it were shown that the developmental point at which the spacing stops being neutral, or rhythmic spacing stops becoming detrimental, is the point at which a Word Superiority Effect emerges.
Hrant is right that many tests knock out parafoveal processing, a key component in immersive reading. However tests I've seen that try to gauge the contribution of parafoveal pre-processing set it at about 19% in terms of the benefit to reading speed, when reading speed is at what we find in people's casual, everday reading of everyday texts. The supercessionary routine I try to specify operates in foveal vision and is partially set up by parafoveal preview. Because my presumed perceptual processing routine pertains to material in foveal vision at and around the point of fixation I see the problem with the studies as a problem of interpretive framework or paradigm, rather than mainly one of ecological validity. I think that the supercessionary perceptual processing response bias established in learning to read is the first line of attack even in the artificial conditions that examine spacing, speed and degradation thresholds. And I think it is unseated by threshold conditions such as alternating case, etc.
It's my impression that Hrant's non-slot-processing routine is, unlike mine, entirely parafoveal. Hrant, correct me if I'm wrong. Relative to this, I also think Hrant has to take the problem of neuro-biological specification in the visual cortex of his scheme much much more seriously if he wants to make a compelling case to me for his claims about processing. It might interest Hrant to know that anatomically the parafovea projects to the magnocelluller stream mentioned in the paper you, Bill, unearthed. So it's not like the basis for effective exploration and specification isn't there. Otherwise it's an issue of posting volume, rhetorical strategies, personalities, susceptibilities and who'll break first.
Typophile probably isn't the place for this level of engagement, so I think a research institute under a type-school umbrella is a better venue. But I have no bites yet.</div>

It could be foveal too, but typically is not needed there because foveal clarity and parallelism power combine to make letterwise certainty generally faster than cognition.

And I have to take my home mortgage even more seriously than that.

This sounds interesting, but I don't really know what it means. Yes, it would be great for me to find out. There are massive holes in my understanding - there's no question about that. But I'm not going anywhere without you guys.
> who’ll break first.
No, who'll build first.
And Typophile is just a means, not an end.

So you're not willing to entertain the first principles and central point of what I've been attempting to put forth?
"No, who’ll build first."
Let me rephrase the point to which that was a reply. Unless we build (explore / specify) together, it's just a question of who will break first.
[You should slow back down to 340 wpm, where accurate sense-following is more robust.]</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think I see the problem.
In answer to the initial question, no... In all likelihood, letterfom features play little or no part in improving readability for dyslexics.
Before continuing, I should mention that I am (very slightly) dyslexic myself. And that "dyslexia" is less a disorder in itself than a common term for a variety of symptoms that have much the same result; i.e. an impaired reading ability despite apparent intellectual capacity. As Vijai P. Sharma, Ph.D put it over to mindpub, 'we can conclude that instead of dyslexia, there are "dyslexias," and all dyslexias are not created equal'.,
The first two orders of classification likely would be 'phonological' and 'surface'. Although the latter has to do with 'misinterpreting' the shapes of letters and/or an inability to recognize words as composed of letters, both appear to be occuring at the synaptic/cognitive level. That is to say, it would seem to be a problem within the brain's processing of abstract associations rather than the eye's ability to follow and relate letters. It can get a lil strange, betimes.
I will write a "5" for an "S", for instance. This seems simple, there is a certain similarity in shape. I will also sometimes write "F" for "5". That seems to be working on an entirely different level. They also have a certain similarity of shape and of course, pronounced, "5" starts with "f'. but.... i will also type "f" for "5". this defies all reason as I am not making the shape and they have no relationship to one another on the kb.
Serifed or non-.... ain't gonna change nuthin'. But please carry on. It is an entertaining squabble.
