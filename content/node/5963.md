  finally registered.. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to get some comments and critique on
  the Corporate Identity for my Webpage. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s called bloobseven.. the
  left symbol stands for an abstract b and the right one for an abstract 7.. <BR>
  <BR>I rounded the edges to make it easier to look at it and added a bit perspective
  to make it look more interesting and recognizable.. what do you think? <BR> <BR>Also
  I&#39;m struggling with the Font Type <BR>Currently I&#39;m using Microgramma which
  was modified a bit in the top left logo version <BR> <BR>c&amp;c appreciated <BR>
  <BR>thx, mike  <BR> <BR>Edit: somehow the html code doesn&#39;t work properly..
  anyway here&#39;s the link: <BR> <BR>http://sile.dhcp.at/bloob_ci.jpg'

  body: 'I guess the biggest concern I would have on your behalf is in the mark. In
    the 50&#39;s &#34;squares&#34; &#40;brainiacs, nerds, mamma&#39;s boys&#41; were
    called &#34;L-7s&#34;, and your mark distinctively looks more like an &#34;L-7&#34;
    than a &#34;b-7&#34;. This might not have been such a big deal, but this &#34;L-7&#34;
    identity had somewhat of a revival in the 90&#39;s, as an abbreviated version
    &#34;L&#34; &#40;Loser&#41; was popularized to the masses by Smashmouth&#39;s
    #1 single. The mark is achieved by pointing up and extending the thumb outward
    to create the &#34;L&#34; shape, similar to how the youth of the 50&#39;s created
    an &#34;L&#34; with one hand and a &#34;7&#34; with the other to form a square.
    I guess my point is that I think too many people still recognize what &#34;L-7&#34;
    represents. <BR> <BR>Aesthetically, it does make a nice shape'

    anything.. It just popped into my head and I liked it, cause I think it&#39;s
    quite unusual and therefore pretty catchy <BR> <BR>Bloobseven is my online portfolio
    , which is currently offline though, where I showcase my work such as CI,websites
    etc. <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t go into the direction of calling it Michael Nagy Design
    on purpose, cause personally I think it sounds too serious <BR> <BR>@Mark: Personally
    I&#39;d prefer a logo rather than a wordmark but in this case I think that the
    wordmark doesn&#39;t necessarily fit the logo <BR> <BR>@ Scott: I can see your
    concern but as far as I know the L7 stuff started in America and since I live
    in Europe, the concern shrinks a bit. <BR> <BR>Keep the comments and ideas coming
    please.. I&#39;ll then try to rework it'

  body: I agree with Scott, although I was not aware of the historical significance
    of L7. But that is what your logo looks like. A simple solution may be to fill
    up the negative space between the two characters with the bowl of the b. However
    that may throw off the balance and look cartoonish. <BR> <BR>Would you please
    post a link to your page, it will help the forum give a more informed critique.
    I tried bloobseven.com but got some kind of on-line coupons site, so the name
    is not so unique. Also tried bloob7 which linked back to bloobseven and was unsucessful
    searching on Google as well. <BR> <BR>look back at other critiques &#34;Klim&#34;,
    &#34;TY &#40;self identity&#41;&#34; and &#34;Munoz&#34; are especially good.
    I&#39;d send you to mine but I haven&#39;t developed a sucessful solution yet.

    <BR>Infinity isn&#39;t over-used like Microgamma and Eurostyle.  <BR> <BR>I think
    if you used &#34;creative&#34; or &#34;design&#34; with bloobseven it would work
    better. There is nothing wrong with using a name that has no real meaning, but
    I would put a word that does have meaning with it. Try placing it under bloobseven
    small with about 1000 points of tracking: <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thirstype/infinity/stextra-bold/testdrive.html?s=CREATIVE&amp;p=16"

    <BR> <BR>Also experiment with possibly having rounded corners on your card. That
    would fit your design. <BR> <BR>On the back of the card I would use a different
    font than what your logo is done with and separate your name from the icon.'

  body: '@Kirsten :  <BR> <BR>I do agree that it looks a lot like L7 but I liked the
    shape and the fact that those two letters form a  kind of circle. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    try to work something out to make it look more like a b without losing the current
    felling and look of the logo though. <BR> <BR>The reason for bloobseven.com and
    bloob7.com redirecting to a coupon/ad site is that I took my page offline last
    august and didn&#39;t pay the extension for the domain.. so some cheeky bloke
    simply nicked it. <BR> <BR>Anyway, if you want to see a few pieces of my artwork

    Make creative the same color as seven &#40;as well as the lighter part of the
    icon&#41;. Also try moving the icon 3/4 of the way to the left of the title above
    it just to see how that looks.

  body: Is this an eye chart test? in small sizes Creative is unreadable. Why space
    creative the whole length of the name? Try just having it the length of Seven
    and get rid of the silly letter spacing. Take your b7 and flush it left the width
    of Bloob. Just suggestions, but the legibility is a problem in small sizes.
