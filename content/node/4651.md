  body: When you say it &#34;doesn&#39;t work&#34; in Word, does that mean it doesn&#39;t
    show up in the font menu, or something else? <BR> <BR>If it just doesn&#39;t show
    up on the menu, then it&#39;s probably what Ken is saying -- though the special
    folder thing applies on all OSes, not just OS X. <BR> <BR>T
