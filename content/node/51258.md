  so they needed a logo that was contemporary, classical and very corporate to represent
  the type of clients they will have to deal with.  So, I need adivce from you experienced
  designers on where to place the 'Consulting' part and which font you think I should
  use. I just can't seem to get it looking right. Any ideas?? Thanks all.\r\n"

  body: "I'd use a letterspaced neutral-looking sans (i'd probably plump for Avenir),
    all caps, aligned with the lefthand stroke of the 'u' and sized to let the G to
    nestle in the crook made by the x.\r\n\r\nAt the moment 'Consulting' is too small,
    and will be lost if the logo is used at small sizes"
