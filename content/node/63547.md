  body: "I remember this typeface from Casco documents and by visiting the website,
    I find your example: [[http://www.cascoprojects.org]]\r\nGiving the context, the
    source,  would help. For example where you found the sample you're trying to ID.\r\nAnyway,
    I think this is a custom typeface from Laurenz Brunner, try to find a PDF on the
    website and check the Embedded fonts through \"Properties\" in Acrobat Reader,
    or, just email them and let us know more about this typeface. Good luck!"
