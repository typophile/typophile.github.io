body: "We have a long-time customer that is aiming to expand their format designs
  for their classical literature series. They have one design that works well, using
  Garamond Premier Pro. Minion would work for the same reason, but I'm curious about
  having a Venetian -- say Bembo Book or Espinosa Nova -- available. Not just any
  Venetian, but one with thick enough fine lines to print well offset, with current
  workflows.\r\n\r\nProblem is, I can't find a Greek that I think mates well. I tried
  Carter's Wilson Greek, but no joy. Please don't say Porson -- it does work, but
  Porson's capital-lower-case sizing is a nightmare.  Anyway, Porson ... see below.\r\n\r\nA
  second issue is that it would be nice to have a Greek family with both a \"roman\"
  and an \"italic/inclined.\" Not exactly the way Greek fonts are often packaged,
  but the presence of a bibliography in a book, with modern source material published
  in Greece, makes the need for a \"roman\" and \"italic\" or \"inclined\" very desireable.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?\r\n\r\nTIA, \r\n\r\ncharles"

  body: I suppose you've already considered Arno Pro. GFS Neohellenic has both upright
    and inclined styles. I'm not so sure it could be said to pair well with something
    like Bembo, but historically it's based on pre-Aldine Venetian Greek type. GFS
    Complutum is perhaps a nicer example of the style, but it doesn't have an inclined.

  body: "The antithesis of Venetian, but my <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/\">Scotch
    Modern</a> does have a proper italic (i.e. one with a different construction to
    the roman, not merely slanted). Its Greek italic also has a different construction
    than the Latin italic\u2020, which provides useful contrast in settings such as
    this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Greek1_5628.jpg]\r\nScotch Modern
    has a Micro size, suitable for footnotes, and all features (small caps, polytonic,
    swash, alternates, &c.) are available in all scripts, weights and optical sizes.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u2020The
    idea being that italic is inherently cursive in nature, with cursivity being represented
    in the Latin italic by pothook serifs, and in the Greek italic by the traditional
    Greek organic/chirographic look with its irregular Baroque stress (Bringhurst\u2019s
    terminology).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
