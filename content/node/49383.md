  body: "Hi John,\r\n\r\nthis is similar to the French school script style. There
    are <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=602&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=v%EAtements+enfant&nb_ppp=50\">a
    couple of free fonts</a> \u2013 but honestly, all of them are rather useless.
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=memimas&site=d&sample_text=v%C3%AAtements%20enfant\">MeMimas</a>
    is a related quality font family \u2013 but that is Spanish style, thus quite
    different in the details.\r\nF"
