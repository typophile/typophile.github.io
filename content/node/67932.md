  body: You could've phrased your question less ambiguously. I spent quite a bit of
    time trying to match your sample to a specific typeface.

  body: "Brian, if you feel offended by (the phrasing of) my question, I sincerely
    apologize. \r\n\r\nLike Atwe I was under the impression that - like in almost
    every thread in th\xEDs forum - you were looking for a font based on a sample
    you had found. Not that you were checking if your design looked like anything
    out there."

    appreciate it if you'd edit your post. \r\n\r\nAtwe, again, I apologize I wasn't
    more clear about this type ID."
