  body: "Nicolas Spalinger is the person for Debian and (I think) Ubuntu by extension.
    He has an email address at sil.org. Jim Gettys was one of the people responsible
    for getting the Bitstream Vera fonts into Gnome, and is now at OLPC. Between the
    two of them, I think they'd have a pretty good sense of who to go to next.\r\n\r\nYou
    can tell them I sent you - they both know me, and I doubt my introduction would
    hurt your chances <em>too</em> badly."

    who has an email address with kde.org. He's been working on the font installer/viewer
    in KDE. The only reason he might remember me, however, was that I was evidently
    one of the only person who wrote in to tell him that I missed the \"font hiding\"
    feature when it was removed from the font installer.\r\n\r\nScott Thatcher"

  body: "Font hiding was just a relatively straight-forward means to turn fonts on
    and off in a user's local .fonts directory. Clicking the hide button would change
    font.ttf to .font.ttf (and vice versa) so that the fontconfig system would no
    longer list it in the available fonts. The only font management feature that I've
    heard of in the Linux environment. Nothing as feature-full as a font-management
    program on a Mac, but combined with creating folders with special-purpose fonts,
    it made my life easier.\r\n\r\nBelow is a message (in response to the wish-list
    item I created) concerning font handling in the soon-to-be-released KDE 4:\r\n\r\n\"KDE4's
    installer features font hiding, and font grouping.\"\r\n\r\nI'll be very interested
    to see how extensive these features are.\r\n\r\nScott Thatcher\r\n"

    Your web site suggest to me that you were making fonts and you were using the
    management as part of testing them. Is that right?'

  body: "Most everything I've done that's related to typography has been of the extremely
    amatuerish nature. That smallcaps font for Palladio is the only font I've ever
    tried to make.  It was a good learning experience, even though I was only trying
    to modify an existing typeface. Just after I made that font, small caps for Palladio
    were introduced into the standard LaTeX distribution by someone else who'd done
    a better job.\r\n\r\nActually, the reason I wanted a little font management had
    to do with the fact that I was the newsletter editor for my church newsleter for
    several years. It was a nice excuse to learn about design and play with typefaces,
    but I didn't want all of the one-use-only display faces installed all the time
    (the food-of-the-month always had its own typeface).  I had a folder for each
    month's newsletter that I could enable or disable.\r\n\r\nI'm always interested
    in posts on typophile that mention Linux. Can I ask what motivated your initial
    question?"

  body: "I see now.\r\n\r\nMy initail question is because I have a monospace for programmers.
    And I would like to talk to the folks who would be my the end user/customer. Also
    I am interested to know if they have different priorities/opinions than windows
    or other programmers. \r\n\r\nBut I am not finding it easy to find the right person
    people to talk to or the right way to make contact. It could also be that fonts
    are just not a priority & so I won't be getting alot of info. \r\n\r\nOriginally
    it seemed to me like soldiers should care about boots - they do.  Chefs should
    care about knives - they do. And progarmmmers should care about their monospace.
    Do they? Pehaps I am caught in spam filters. Or maybe I am too impatient. We'll
    see I suppose.\r\n"

    always thought that programmers are one of the few groups that really get to choose
    how their work, and the work of others, is displayed. They do seem to care about
    fonts, rendering modes, and un-ambiguous letter shapes. Not sure if that translates
    to them paying for new fonts though. :-(\r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n"

    subsidized by the boss. They might be right. ;-) After all they don't buy the
    machines they work on either. They might also feel it was something outside their
    expertise or... 100 other things. That's why I want to chat. My own programming
    pals have been generous with me. They have definitely shaped what I have so far.
    But my sample size is too small. \r\n\r\nCare to send me some MS insight? Have
    you tracked ( or observed ) at what rate the in-house staff are using Consolas?
    Or other fonts? As I say, my sample size is small but they all seem to like their
    fonts without smoothing. What about at MS? Are my pals odd or typical?"

    some research that showed developers could spot more bugs (typos in code) with
    Consolas (CT enabled) vs Courier New (CT off). \r\n\r\nI don't know how many internal
    folks use Consolas, but anecdotally initially many developers didn't like ClearType,
    but also they were amongst the most vocal complainers when CT was broken in Windows
    XP builds.  \r\n\r\nMike Duggan may have some more info. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
