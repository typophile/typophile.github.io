		<div class="commentbody">In Northern Ireland, religion is invoked in rhetoric and the divisions are broadly drawn along religious lines, but the conflict of the past thirty years is largely due to social and economic inequality, and the 20th century political history of Irish independence is more important than the longer religious history. In many respects, the situation in Northern Ireland is similar to that of apartheid in South Africa, only the systemic inequality is between Protestants (mainly Presbyterian and unionist) and Catholics (largely, but not exclusively, republican), rather than between whites and blacks. The religious aspect of the conflict comes through most obviously on the Unionist side, in the rhetoric of anti-Catholic bigots like Ian Paisley, and the violence of the mobs that terrorise Catholic neighbourhoods during 'marches' simply because they are Catholic. As far as I know, no one on the 'Catholic side' ever describes their struggle as one against Protestantism: it is a political and civil rights struggle, not a religious war.</div>

Or would this substitution still be rergarded as blasphemous? crumbs. One could go around in ever diminishing circles with your advertising/design bible!

		<div class="commentbody">It's a pity that I've left no more time in this interesting discussion, and in a few hours I have to leave for a seminar in book typography. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So please excuse short words (and bad english): <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guillaume: I myself estimate separation between church and state a high good. But it's a way of respectable citizenship to respect the beliefs of others. You are right: Christians shouldn't care that kind of things - and in most cases I don't, sometimes I can join laughing. But not everyone is superior to making fun of something - and you should care of the weak. At least because their anger is dangerous for the state and for generous christians too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->William: I can't look at Tanyas design that critical. Only the reference to the cross is problematic for me. It could be taken away without changing the &quot;bible style&quot;. But here in Germany (and I think in Europe) a lot of people are wearing little golden crosses as jewellry, and sometimes definitely not in a possible meaning of gods blessing - christians had to learn to make differences in the meaning and be generous (though of course some few christians name that blasphemy). I havent been in USA: What about cross-jewellry in the USA? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;Macintosh bible&quot; is more problematic for me. It's not only sacred symbols. &quot;Bible&quot; is for christians a sacred concept. If you take it to name such a profane thing - the association of &quot;holy scripture&quot; to a computer Manual - then in my eyes there is maybe more possible (!) blasphemy as in an inadequate use of the cross. (But don't misunderstand me: I can use that books without heartaches, I only think it's inadequate and I'm concerned about the way too much power, computers get in our world.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John: I don't know too much about Northern Ireland, but the things I know (that it's not at first a religious conflict) make me think you are right (&quot;anti-catholic bigots&quot;). And when I see/hear of that marches I'm ashamed of that  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->doing in the name of protestantism. And I can't understand that it's still allowed by the government. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on the jewish/islamic topic: I think, if an Israeli would take the Talmud design an transfer it to a profane context - the problem is all the same. If we did it across cultural lines  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a) it wouldn't be understandable  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->b) other meanings would run along, for example a ridiculous attitude of the majority to the religious minority.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

I mocked up an escort card for &quot;the hooker in the poster&quot; - as a random giveaway with info about the awards and where to get more info. Certain emails targetting specific diciplines of design were sent out as notes from &quot;the hooker in the poster&quot; The tickets were actually keys with a &quot;hotel tag&quot; packaged in the envelop with the keys.. a note written on a cocktail napkin saying &quot;meet me at &hellip;and a kiss mark.  During the Awards Night presentation the emcees would  make remarks about how it was that they came here for an 'appointment'  The banners and decorations all &quot;look but don't touch&quot; and &quot;tisk tisk&quot; shame on you for being here kind of thing. y'no people being persuaded that easily and commenting on how it is that sex still sells. - coming full circle in comparison to our industry. making things look appealing to our targets, being able to help clients get more money stuff like that. The venue was going to be at motel. And what do you find at a motel? when your going to meet a prostitute the one item in that room that could make you think twice might be that bedside table - you know there's a bible in there.  so the awards booklet - with all the winners was going to be layed out like as such. but that's not given out until the end of the night, after all the anticipation - its a take home and reference book. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had a much more eloquent rationale before but that's the general gist of it. I think <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, anywho a couple weeks later - much to my surprise that night I had gone to the event about who won the campaign - they called our company name. Whopps!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I went in the next morning to tell the bosses what I'd done. hey guys, I kind'a submitted that idea just for fun, but we kind'a won the campaign too - so umm we kind'a havt'a do it now I guess? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Its pretty mcuh been my responsibility because they didn't want to participate in the beginning. So going along, going along, everythings worked out wonderfully&hellip;I'm starting the layout of the book and all of a sudden the bosses take notice of how doing all this is fun and benefitial I start involving them a little more and ask for input - seems he has opinions about it all now. everything else has been produced and sent out - this is the last piece. LAST. and its back to the drawing board. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the end <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

There's me dressed up in nylons and a short skirt. &quot;its been a tough year, we've all had to pull a few tricks&quot; Its not that far off an idea. Many designers are taking side jobs, many designers are doing wotever they can to win that RFP. In any sector &quot;in bed with the client&quot; is a regular comment. All these things can be suggested by my campaign - but they AREN'T. I put an image with a tag line and title - its up to the recipient to figure out what they want that to mean. I didn't shout any opinions whatsoever.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your quick to judge whats bad taste and all you know is that I've used a symbol from the  prostitution industry. What your really saying is that prostitution is in poor taste not my campaign. Am I to ignore industry's that exist simply because they might not be the holiest? I'm simply making a correlation between the first, dare I say honest, and quintesential form of advertising (prostitution) and our industry today. Take for fact that what you see is what you get unlike how we might use animals to sell phones, kids to sell food, ect. ect. but now your saying using sex they way they might to sell sex is poor taste, oh yes they are awful awful people? I can't beleive what they do?, their industry is in bad taste? Get over yourself. In fact one could view it as a nod to the ladies of the night and its simple and everlasting existance.  I'm acknowledging the ideas that are common between their industry and ours - if you've come to the conculsion thats in bad taste I suggest you open your mind a little and take note of what you do for a living. You are no more holier than thou. A prostitute was used as a symbol, you should be able to see that the concept was actually relating to issues &amp; ethics, no opinions, no statements made - simply what goes on today and that I left it up to the recipients to discuss. Moreover I'm poking fun at OUR industry, other industry's were used in very matter of fact ways.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->would it have been better had I done some kind'a designery eye-candy in some chic style, spring colours, with black turtleneck wearing glamour models sporting the lastest titanium notebooks? Is that concept in better taste for and ad/design awards? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->somehow I guess the industry over here sees through all that - for some reason they picked this campaign, I really didn't expect it but perhaps discussion is valued moreso then a purdy looking campaign that gets your attention but says crap all. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

Most all public and private education, scholarship and history in the Western world can be traced back to monasteries. (And yes, much of it can be traced back further to classical times.) Every time you write down what year it is, every time you write anything at all in the Latin alphabet, you are drawing upon (among other things) Christian history. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Whether this demands any sense of reverence or caution obviously depends on what you believe, and you're certainly not going to offend anyone by merely communicating. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tanya, I understand and appreciate the message you're trying to convey, but don't expect every Christian to laugh off the casual appropriation of their symbols, regardless of what they're used for.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John your right - and if this project had of gone ahead I probably would have removed the cross. I could have represented the look and feel of a bible just as well without it I'm sure. I was unsure myself and heard it once by Michael that it irked him - so it would have been taken off. Its not that big of a deal or an element that's detrimental to the design. What I showed was simply my first comp. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->regardless of the cross - mentions of it being in bad taste are what are getting me going here. If anything its a reminder of their faith and beleifs. I don't see how using the look and feel of a bible is laughable or humourous and why any Christian should think so. What is I think in bad taste might be if I had a cross in Neon lights perched on top of the building - but unlike what some churches do to get your attention my use of the cross I thought elegant and respectful. I could have highlighted what was cheesy or silly of some congregations in my concept, I could have tied in the offers to the church and how they could get salvation, but that's bad taste, not honest representation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anyway - I don't think this has anything more to do with typography.</div>

In the first case, causing offense is no more likely to make a prejudiced person think than anything else (although there may be virtue in offending the bigoted, especially if important principles&ndash;e.g. civil rights&ndash;are at stake). In the second case, the person is already thinking. Again, in my experience, when 10% of people are offended by something, most of them are offended because the thing is offensive to what they think: the thing itself does not 'make them think a bit at least'. They have already thought and come to the conclusion that some things are morally, aesthetically or intellectually offensive (often all three). Typically, it is the 90% who are not thinking, who accept everything without question, and so cannot even imagine why something might be offensive.</div>

I think these could make all the difference for your project. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Consider adding verse numbers every one or two lines throughout the text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Perhaps a chapter number at the top, though this will probably interfere with your drop cap.

I really don't much care whether anyone was offended or upset by the imagery of prostitution or simply disappointed not to be able to have an excuse to put on a tux. I just don't see the presumed connection between being upset, for whatever reason, and being made to think a bit. As it happens, I think your prostitution idea is quite witty &ndash; not in the best of taste, but nor are lots of other clever, amusing things &ndash;, I just don't think the people who were upset by it were necessarily provoked by it. Many of the things that upset or even offend me are simply tedious and banal and anything but thought provoking.</div>

I agree with John Hudson that your concept is witty and not in the best taste. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspect that I think it is worse taste than John does. Here are my reasons. According to the National Organization for Women, there are around the world one million girls every year snatched or sold into prostitution. In North America the sex industry I have read is full of pimps who drug and beat their girls to keep them in line, and take most of their money. Around the world, many are infected with AIDS. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In prostitutes, you are talking about a class of people who are some of the most oppressed and miserable in the world. I just think the fact of this misery means that they are not a good topic of humor or wit. It falls flat on me. Is the sex industry 'awful, awful' - yes it looks that way to me.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And yes, I do think it is degrading to give sex for money, and that sex is beautiful and even sacred in a good marriage. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I may be wrong in my views, but I don't see how it makes me worthy of the contempt you heep on me.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

I asked for ideas for fonts guys, nothing more. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is turning into a strange debate about gender roles when it was never, ever, ever suggested in my campaign.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I suspect if I had had a pimp in the ad instead of a prostitute it would have been the same argument? What if I had found a male friend at 3am that night and used him as the model for a prostitute would that have been the same argument? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Prostitution is NOT the theme of this campaign, your really taking off on a tangent. By your standards we might as well  never have a gangster character in an ad piece - cause well - they kill people, skip politicians too or any gov. figure - cause they all lie.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I guess the Garry Marshall's movie 'Pretty Woman', Milk Money, Risky Business, Ron Howard's Nightshift, Elizabeth Taylor in Eight, Nick Cage's Leaving Las Vegas was all pretty poor taste too. they had prostitutes in them.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Furthermore, what your describing has nothing to do with my campaign. I simply  havn't gone anywhere near illustrating the horrors that can happen in my campaign. Its just a character I'm associating with.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But if I'm going to argue we can point out that sex work does not encourage the demeaning of women. Poverty demeans women, and by jumping right off on that neo-Victorian bandwagon your displaying a condescending belief that prostitutes don't know what they're doing and need somebody with more education to protect them. While some may, other women actually choose the profession. In fact many well-off North, South American, European,  Asian and a whole gamut of women choose the profession over their medical practice, law degrees. We could argue issues of economic equality, affirmative action, and sexual liberation&hellip;but please not my having a &quot;character&quot; in an ad piece. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Would it help if I said the prostitute in my ad chose her profession and she's not beaten, dosen't do drugs, and has no pimp to report to. In fact she's having a good time? I did after all volunteer and give consent to myself to use the picture.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To rival your association plug there's also the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;President</div>
