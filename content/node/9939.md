body: I have Photoshop 7 and Win XP, but am not very experienced in PS. I just downloaded
  the Bickham Script Pro from Adobe. In Photoshop, I did some type in the regular
  characters, but I cannot find how to access the alternate characters for this font.
  Adobe wants $39.95 to answer the question, so I hope to get help here. The dropdown
  next to the right of the font box says &#34;regular&#34; and there are no other
  options to select.

    of the character palette?

  body: 'Yes. I can&#39;t remember how many OpenType features were supported in Photoshop
    7, though. Conveniently, the chart I put in the back of the Adobe OpenType User
    Guide covers this, and the user guide explains a lot about how these features
    work. <BR> <BR>Currently found at: <BR>&#60;<a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/otguide.pdf"

  body: finally we got picture evidence that typophile is powered by Photoshop CS!
    <BR> <BR>But seriously, why is the glyph window missing from Photoshop CS that
    is used in InDesign and Illustrator? What about the so praised application interface
    consistency of Adobe?

    glyph palette. Illustrator adopted it in CS. Perhaps Photoshop will grab it in
    the future. <BR> <BR>T'

  body: what i want to know is why photoshop handles OT features so much differently
    from InDesign & Illustrator. When you switch on the "swash" feature in InD, you
    get swsh+cswh. In Photoshop you can't access the cswh feature. In InD the "discressionary
    ligatures" switches on dlig+hlig. In Photoshop you only get the dlig tag applied.
    this drives me batty. does anyone else have any additional pitfalls i should avoid
    when writing OT code where the Photoshop programmers were not on the same page
    as the InD team???

    InDesign programmers work in Seattle. So they never even get a chance to meet
    for lunch :) \r\n\r\nIf you look at Creative Suite 2, you will notice that the
    user interfaces of Photoshop and Illustrator look alike (e.g. the way the new
    WYSIWYG font menus were implemented) but InDesign's UI looks totally different.

  body: "Yep, I agree with Paul. I'm still on CS1 and OS X. And using the character
    palette does not allow me to past the glyph into Photoshop. There's a small note
    that says, \"Current application does not support glyph variant.\"\r\n\r\n"
