body: "I am making a complex font family, and the menu ordering is driving me crazy.\r\nI
  want to have a menu that is something like this:\r\n\r\nTypeface name (family name,
  with the following style names)\r\n     Bodyface01\r\n     Bodyface01 Italic\r\n
  \    Bodyface02\r\n     Bodyface02 Italic\r\n     Subhead 01\r\n     Subhead 01
  Italic\r\n     Subhead 02\r\n     Subhead 02\r\n     Subhead 02 Italic\r\n     Head
  01\r\n     Head 01 Italic\r\n     Head 02\r\n     Head 02 Italic\r\n\r\nInstead
  I get:\r\n\r\nTypeface name (family name, with the following style names)\r\n     Bodyface01\r\n
  \    Bodyface02\r\n     Head 01\r\n     Head 02\r\n     Subhead 01\r\n     Subhead
  02\r\n     Bodyface01 Italic\r\n     Bodyface02 Italic\r\n     Head 01 Italic\r\n
  \    Head 02 Italic\r\n     Subhead 01 Italic\r\n     Subhead 02 Italic\r\n\r\nI
  can understand/live with the Subheads appearing at the bottom, but why dont the
  italics appear under the romans, as alphabetic logic would suggest?\r\n\r\nIve tried
  it using Fontographer 4.1 and Fontlab 4.6\r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    There are some differences in font menus across platforms and between applications....\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I'm mainly interested in a Type 1 family working in Mac InDesign CS. I'm
    wondering if the numbers are messing things up, though numbers are not unusual
    in font names. I found a good-looking thread at http://www.typophile.com/node/31118.
    (Thanks Adam Twardoch.) I will try the approach there.\r\n\r\n"
