body: "Principles of form and design by Wucius Wong 1993\r\n\r\nIs it so difficult
  to actually indicate which section/chapter we are in?\r\nSome of the text refers
  to other chapters. If I want to go to that chapter I have to go to the contents
  page, find the chapter, but hold on, it is split into sections and chapters.\r\nI
  have to check the section and then the chapter. Get the page number then go there.\r\nSome
  of the illustrations are not labelled consistently. Fig. 58a could be on the next
  page, the figure numbers are sometimes right next to the gutter, bend the pages
  to clearly see what they are. I still can't believe that Josef Muller-Brockmann
  used the inner gutter margin to put his page numbers.\r\n\r\nAre there anymore design/navigation
  annoyances?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: The designer 'not thinking' is <em>the</em> major design annoyance. All these
    'rules' change anyway from context to context, so forget about them. Instead make
    up a barely sufficient system, a system which is barely there, yet sufficient
    for the object.

    </em>\r\n\r\nSure, but that's like saying that politicians are the major reason
    that our governments are useless. (And let's not go down that road, please.  We
    all have grumpiness with our respective leaders/losers.)\r\n\r\nTrying to come
    with any kind of minimal system is going to land you in big trouble, because there's
    just too much leeway in implementation and interpretation. \r\n\r\nOT: There was
    a long stretch where my nickname in the design world was \"Dirty Harry\" -- if
    you recall from the original movie, when he was asked why he was called that,
    the answer was \"every dirty ******* job that comes along\": I lost count on how
    many projects I had to \"save\"....  :-("

  body: "Part of design is the aesthetic of it all, then the other part is functionality.
    Especially when working with publication design.\r\n\r\nFor example. \r\n\r\nIn
    \"Meggs' History of Graphic Design\" they take a very untraditional approach to
    their handle of the copy. It is very \"creative\" but there are several things
    I find wrong with it.\r\n\r\n1. The use of san-serif fonts for the body copy.
    This strains my eyes when all the letter forms are made up of the same stroke
    weight and I don't have serifs that take that guesswork out of which letterform
    is which. \r\n\r\n2. The columns run to close to the gutter, so to read the copy
    closest to the spine I have to flatten the pages out as far as they will go, reading
    the first chapter was almost impossible. \r\n\r\n3. There is no thumb-space. I
    can't hold the book and read it. The book MUST be set down. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this
    book was designed the functionality and the idea that somebody will actually sit
    down and read this book was completely ignored. Granted it LOOKS nice, but reading
    it is a chore. \r\n\r\nSo in short, my design annoyance is neglect of the end
    user, the reader."

  body: "Visual Research: An Introduction to Research Methodologies in Graphic Design
    (AVA Academia)  by Ian Noble and Russell Bestley\r\n\r\nOver design - on most
    left hand pages (not on the initial chapter page or full bleed images pages) they
    have the page number and the page number of the next page. Is that a waste of
    ink or something? I am too stupid to work out that the next page is going to be
    1 more than this page?\r\nThen some of the text refers to chapter numbers. Guess
    what? The actual pages of the chapters only have the titles and not 'chapter 1'
    etc.\r\n\r\nThe actual book is full of woolly theory and concrete examples. It
    is easy to read, it looks 'oversize', like someone pointed a zoom lense to the
    pages. \r\nI have not actually found a really good/well designed navigation in
    a book.\r\nAnyone suggest a really good navigation example? "
