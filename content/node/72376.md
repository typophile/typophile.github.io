  am creating at the moment. I have licensed metroscript and would like to increase
  the contrast so the logo is scaleable and legible in small sizes. \r\n\r\nSo far
  i have filled the \"O\"'s counter, as well as the \"A\"'s to increase legibility,
  however I am still struggling to add contrast to the logo.\r\n\r\nAre there any
  tips you might have?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n2fewdjs"

  body: "Hi 2fewdjs,\r\n\r\nI don't think giveing it a contrast will increase legibility
    in small sizes. Why do you think so?\r\n\r\nYour modifications are a good start,
    though. Some more ideas:\r\n\r\n- Remove the stroke that connects o and c. Connections
    between letter significantly reduce legibility, and it also looks a bit unnatural
    without the loop. You can even try to disconnect all letters.\r\n\r\n- Give the
    \"a\" a top-right corner, possibly letting either the vertical stroke or the bow
    stick out slightly.\r\n\r\n- Join the bow and the diagonal of the R.\r\n\r\n-
    Fill the loops of s and r and make them smaller.\r\n\r\n- In the k, remove the
    stroke below the upper loop (the one that conects the vertical and the upper diagonal)
    and give the tip of the diagonal a nice terminal."

  body: 'I don''t agree with Tim about removing all connections, but o c feels unnatural.
    How about a loop in the top right corner? The top right part of a is a little
    bumpy. If you''re going small, you''ll probably want to either make small counters
    bigger (in s and r you may also try filling them) or remove them (as I would have
    considered with the loops on your ascending characters). Don''t worry about contrast
    at first. You have to test print, but smaller text often need more space between
    characters.  '

  body: "I agree about losing the o c connection. Its kind of unnatural feature in
    some scripts that just muddies up the design. \r\n\r\nI don't know how far down
    you need to scale this to know how the contrast will effect this. In text faces
    smaller point sizes (Letterpress at least) were traditionally given less contrast
    both for holding up to printing well and also just to visually match larger sizes.
    That being said, sometimes a heavy script can look almost monoweight at smaller
    sizes so its definitely worth trying more contrast out and seeing how it sets."
