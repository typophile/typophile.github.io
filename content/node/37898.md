  it: Take pictures of type that you think is interesting, well-made or odd in some
  way. Well, I decided to put mine up on a blog, and you're all very much invited:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.madshougaard.dk/blog]]\r\n\r\nMy
  idea is to tag each letter, so that you'll  be able to hit (for example) 'e' in
  the sidebar and be presented with a lot of different ways to do e's. Geeky! I know.
  \r\n\r\nMy hope is that this will turn out to be some sort of inspiration resource
  when you're designing type or logos.\r\n\r\nIf you know of other sites that do the
  same thing I would be happy to hear from you. \r\nOf course, I'd be happy to hear
  from you altogether :)\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nMads\r\n\r\n"

    street signs. \r\n\r\nI was just contacted by Mandy Milks who could answer my
    question. \r\nApparently there are quite a few blogs like mine :)\r\n\r\nYou can
    check out their website here:\r\n[[http://villatype.blogspot.com]]\r\n\r\nThey
    also have a nice collection of links to others."
