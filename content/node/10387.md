body: This summer another student and myself will participate in a Students Partnering
  with Faculty Summer Research Program along with a faculty member/design professional.
  The program will involve researching typography, studying typefaces, typographic
  classification, and meeting with design professionals. Then, in late summer/early
  fall we will each begin work to design and create our own typeface.  <BR> <BR>I
  was wondering if those of you who have experience designing and creating typefaces
  can recommend the best computer program for it. Work will be done, of course, on
  Macs. Macromedia&#39;s Fontographer seems to be the first choice, but does FontLab
  seem a more appropriate choice? <BR> <BR>Please discuss which programs you prefer
  and the reasons why. Any information you can provide would be extremely helpful.

  body: I would respectfully suggest that you not consider Fontographer. It is like
    riding to the Oscars in a Pinto. Wouldn&#39;t you rather take a limousine? &#40;That
    would be FontLab.&#41; <BR> <BR>Fontographer has not been updated in 10 &#40;11?&#41;
    years, and is therefore stuck in the dark ages of typeface development. FontLab
    has an active and responsive team of programmers that make appearances on these
    and other forums. FontLab can be intimidating at first, but it can also be as
    simple as you want it to be, and the drawing tools are unmatched anywhere &#40;including
    Illustrator and Freehand&#41;.

    <BR> <BR>I would recommend TypeTool or Fontographer, which has a very good Mac
    interface, and is a more direct design tool.  <BR> <BR>Many type designers still
    use Fontographer for creating glyphs and basic metrics/kerning. While it cannot
    make OpenType fonts, it&#39;s unlikely that you will get that far, and the Type
    1 and TrueType fonts that Fontographer makes are perfectly serviceable.

    does not support OpenType, although unicode values can be assigned, I believe.
    <BR> <BR>I would only recommend using Fontographer if you already have a copy.
    Spending the money to buy it would just be a total waste. If you buy TypeTool,
    you can upgrade to the full FontLab package later. <BR> <BR>Nick is severely more
    advanced as a type designer than I am. But I have found FontLab a dream to use.
    I switched from Fontographer two months ago, and have not experienced one single
    problem. Having a copy of Leslie Carbarga&#39;s <i>Learn FontLab Fast</i> by my
    side made the &#34;learning curve&#34; a non issue.

    as well learn one that&#39;s going to be around for a while. What&#39;s more,
    FontLab is not more complicated to learn than Fontographer. In fact, I think it&#39;s
    easier by far.

    used Fontographer 3.5 for some of my tasks, for two very important reasons: &#40;a&#41;
    its AI/EPS import feature is unsurpassed &#40;FOG 4.1 doesn&#39;t import a full
    em square, and FontLab&#39;s approach is beyond bizarre&#41;; and &#40;b&#41;
    all of its simple transform tools are directly accessible via keystroke combinations
    &#40;both FOG 4.1 and FontLab require mousing around, which slows you down&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>One of the few things that FOG 4.1 is still good for is path clean-up
    although, even at its lowest setting, it&#39;s a little promiscuous deleting points.
    However, unlike FontLab, it does NOT see flat curves, semi-horizontal vectors
    and semi-vertical vectors everywhere. If you have gentle curves in your outlines,
    FontLab&#39;s OPTIMIZE command is likely to turn them into stick figures.'

  body: Adam, <BR>for me too, the eps-import in FL is strange, to say the least. I
    still prefer drawing in Illustrator. To get your glyphs imported at the right
    size and place you need to copy a rectangle, which starts at the zero point and
    goes to cap height, from FL and paste it into Illustrator. It has to be at the
    zero-point in the Ill. document and it gets to be such an absurd size that if
    you draw a string of characters they soon run of the page, even if you draw on
    a large &#39;page&#39;. In fontographer you just take care the letters you draw
    are between two lines, and these lines will be cap height and deschender depth,
    no matter how big or small the drawing in Ill. Being able to draw a string of
    characters &#40;or words, if you want&#41; is the main reason for me still using
    Illustrator, apart from the morre easily available drawing and editing tools.

    for the autotrace feature, TypeTool for the precision of point placement. Don&#39;t

    is dreadful. There is an antialiasing feature in TypeTool obviously, so lines

  body: 'Adam: <BR> <BR>I would submit that the other responses about FL&#39;s strange
    EPS behavior make my point. The reason that I believe FOG 3.5&#39;s EPS import
    is superior is that it assumes that what you import in 1000 points high &#40;more
    about this later&#41;; FOG 4.1 assumes that what you import is equal to the ascent
    of the font; I cannot, for the life of me, figure out WHAT FL assumes -- all that
    I know is that, in my experience, the manual instructions don&#39;t work, and
    a couple of workarounds I&#39;ve seen posted elsewhere don&#39;t work either.
    <BR> <BR>When I export EPS for FOG 3.5, I place tick marks at ascent and descent
    on all my characters &#40;a simple process that takes less than five minutes&#41;.
    Then, when I import the EPS characters into FOG 3.5, they fall exactly where they
    ought to, and they are correctly proportioned to one another. The only way to
    accomplish this in FOG 4.1 is to set the ascent at 1000, with no descent, import
    all your characters, reset the ascent and descent, then move all of the characters
    down so they sit on the new baseline. <BR> <BR>I took your advice about tweaking
    the OPTIMIZE options and the results were mixed. I could eliminate the &#34;stick
    figure&#34; results, but the downside was that some redundant points were NOT
    cleaned up. The various combination I tried of the ten available choices seemed
    to yield either too much or too little, and none were &#34;just right.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>One the other hand, in my humble opinion, the outline cleanup features in
    DTL&#39;s ContourMaster Light are superior to ANYTHING else out there, BUT...their
    15000-units-to-the-em measurement system causes some &#34;point shift&#34; once
    you convert the outlines back to a 1000-unit em, so you still have to check every
    character to correct the instances where dividing by fifteen produced unsatisfactory
    results.'

  body: In FOG 4.1.3 &#40;Mac&#41; art pasted in from Illustrator is scaled up to
    the full em square height. Holding down the command and option keys while choosing
    Paste from the menu scales it to the ascent. Holding just the option key causes
    the art to scale the same as FontLab &#40;1 point &#40;in Illustrator&#41; equal
    to 1 em unit&#41; with the bottom of the art resting on the baseline. These optional
    paste commands seem to work if you do it completely from the keyboard, you have
    to choose the Paste command from the menu with the mouse. This could be some peculiarity
    due to running FOG in Classic on OS X. I seem to recall that you used to be able
    to just use the keyboard. <BR> <BR>I used to draw in Illustrator and move art
    to FOG, and that workflow kept me from switching to FontLab for quite a while,
    even after I owned a copy. But copying and pasting from Illustrator to FL is not
    that hard once you realize how it works.  <BR> <BR>Scale your Illustrator art
    so that 1 point corresponds to 1 em unit &#40;i.e., if your target cap height
    is 700 em units, make your caps in Illustrator 700 points tall&#41;. Move the
    Illustrator ruler zero point to the origin point of the character art you want
    to copy. Copy from Illustrator, paste in FL. Simple. <BR> <BR>The biggest problems
    are getting the clipboard preferences set correctly in Illustrator &#40;should
    be AICB/Preserve Paths&#41; and dealing with rounding-down errors &#40;no fractional
    em units in fonts, despite what FOG may lead you to believe&#41;. <BR> <BR>Personally,
    I have completely switched to drawing directly in FontLab. It&#39;s much more
    efficient and I wish I&#39;d starting doing it sooner. I blame FOG&#39;s &#40;in
    my opinion&#41; clumsy drawing tools for my previous reliance on Illustrator.
    I think I would have been better off drawing in FOG, too, in hindsight.

    not assume &#42;anything&#42;. If in Preferences / General / Do not rescale...
    is deactivated, then 1 point in EPS = 1 FontLab unit. When the option is enabled,
    then FontLab assumes that what you import is 700 units high.  <BR> <BR>Also, you
    don&#39;t need to place any tick marks whatsoever. Just place the characters in
    Illustrator of Freehand so that the 0,0 point of the EPS document is on the font&#39;s

    EXACTLY as if they were font units in FL. It&#39;s actually pretty simple.  <BR>

    pleasantly surprised that this method works and terribly chagrined that I was
    such a dunce the last time I tried it, there is still another however to consider...the
    method you propose requires that the origin point be moved for EVERY character
    that you export, which for me typically is no fewer than 120 characters. Add to
    that Illustrator&#39;s page size limit of 16,383 pts AND only one page per document,
    and I would also have to create SEVERAL documents to handle my super-sized outlines.
    <BR> <BR>Given all the extra effort involved, I fail to see where FontLab&#39;s
    method is an improvement over the way FOG 3.5 did it. Don&#39;t get me wrong...I
    think FontLab is a GREAT program and, if I had to choose only one font creation

    4 costs $99, not $200. Since Corel DRAW supports multiple layers &#42;and&#42;

  body: 'Adam, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the links: there are a couple of tools there which
    should make the process of scaling and positioning much easier than they normally
    would be in CorelDraw. I will give them a try, and see if I can&#39;t conquer
    this EPS import problem and eventually retire trusty old FOG 3.5. <BR> <BR>While
    I have your attention, there are a few other FL &#34;problems&#34; I would like
    to bring to the fore... <BR> <BR>First, it would be REALLY nice to be able to
    set more defaults in the FONT INFO dialogue. I am the only designer using FL on
    my computer, so it would be convenient if the program would remember my personal
    URL, website URL and licensing info...no biggy, but it would be convenient. <BR>
    <BR>Second, while FL&#39;s zoom capabilities FAR exceed those of FOG, they still
    stop a little shy of where I&#39;d like. Being able to zoom into, say, a 3x3 point
    grid would come in handy when trying to edit the curves at the end of a tiny round
    serif. CorelDraw can zoom to 400,000%, which is probably excessive, but a LITTLE
    more magnification in FL would be helpful. <BR> <BR>Finally, from time to time,
    I get reports back of Mac PS fonts on OS 9 displaying not a preview of the font
    in question, but of a sans-serif system font. The cause, I believe, is a FOND
    ID # conflict &#40;TypeTool/FL default is 128&#41;, so the problem is easy enough
    to fix. However, it would also be quite convenient if there were a way &#40;like,
    just pressing a button&#41; to tie the FOND ID # to the unique PSID number &#40;hash/add
    6000 to the last 4 digits/whatever&#41; to lessen the chance that this problem
    would occur. Again, no biggy, but it would be helpful.'

    biggy, but it would be convenient. &#34; <BR> <BR>The appropriate way to do this
    is to have a .vfb file to use as a template. In FLS5, there will be an option
    that will open a .vfb file of user&#39;s choice instead of a blank font when the
    user chooses File / New. In essence, this will work like Word templates.  <BR>

    to work differently. So that&#39;s really something for a tiny little Python script.
    In fact, you can put any Python commands e.g. into the save.py file within your
    FontLab folder, and then the commands will be executed whenever a FontLab file
    is saved. You could put such a scriptlet that ties FOND ID to Unique ID there,
    and forget about running it manually.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam'

    default em-square for the BE &#40;Bezier&#41; format is 15000 like the default
    em for the IK format, is probably caused by the BE glyph database of the FM Demo
    Font, which is enclosed in the FM installers. The reason that this BE file has
    the same em as the IK version, is that this made it possible to enclose only one
    UFM for both formats. This underlines how versatile a separate naming and metrics
    file is, but I must honestly admit that it never occurred to me that this would
    result in the idea that everything in FM is based on 15000 units. Although very
    occasionally FM will convert internally the format to an em of 15000, all functions
    very well with whatever em. For instance DTL ContourMaster works perfectly with
    an em of 1000 and there is no need to do any conversion beforehand. All of the
    DTL glyph databases in BE format have an em of 1000. For Ikarus the default is
    however 15000 units and in case analog data is manually digitized &#40;which we
    still often do&#41;, 100 units correspond to 1 centimeter. <BR> <BR>For version
    2.1.3 of FM, the BE glyph database for the FM Demo Font has been set to 1000.

    which would result in a number well within what I believe is the accepted range
    for regular encoding. And, although PSIDs may be passe, they remain handy for
    assigning unique SKU numbers to one&#39;s fonts. <BR> <BR>And...while YOU&#39;RE
    on the line, has Acrobat 7 addressed the issue of Acrobat and Illustrator not
    being able to agree on what Times New Roman Bold should be called? I work in the
    prepress department of a printing company, and the unwashed public gives us LOTS
    of MS Word documents &#40;most of which, unimaginatively, use the default font&#41;
    that have to go into the production pipeline. PDF format is, of course, the easiest

    Objects&#34; option in Acrobat 6. Illustrator CS consistently does not recognize
    TNR Bold &#40;Roman and Italic, yes, so go figure&#41;, and substitutes Myriad
    &#40;no choice in the matter, either, another of Illustrator&#39;s irksome qualities&#41;.

    except for limited private use. Adobe maintains a registry of UniqueIDs; people
    can and should get UniqueIDs assigned by Adobe if they are going to use them in
    retail fonts. Otherwise you&#39;re just playing Russian roulette on a larger scale.
    <BR> <BR>Using a UniqueID as the basis for a SKU does not make technical sense,

    would address it accordingly. My suggestion was predicated on what I suspect are
    the vast majority of cases where Mac Roman encoding is desired. A default setting
    or procedure that generates a FOND ID number that is less likely to conflict with
    system fonts could, and would, be overridden if circumstances so require. I am
    not suggesting that one size fits all, but it would be more convenient if one

    some getting used to, but now I prefer my new method. It's much faster (mainly
    due to fewer steps) and more controllable. I actually find it more difficult to
    draw in Illustrator now.\r\n\r\nYou should be aware, however, that there are big
    differences between drawing in Illustrator and drawing in FontLab. The biggest
    one is that Illustrator allows practically infinite precision in point placement,
    whereas FontLab constrains you to whole em-units. This can be good or bad, depending
    on how you look at it. Being able to work in unconstrained units avoids rounding
    errors that can occour when scaling outlines, but it also gives you a false sense
    of how precisely you can place points in glyph space (which is always constrained
    to whole em-units). \r\n\r\nConsequently, if you work in Illustrator, you must
    check for rounding errors when importing the artwork into FontLab. If you draw
    directly in FontLab, it's essentially WYSIWYG and there's no need for that step."

    designer during the entire process, so you're always WYSIWYG. Fontographer goes
    a different path: it allows you to draw in fractional coordinates but when you
    generate the font, the coordinates get rounded to the next integer coordinates.
    So there is no final control over what will end up where (although it is possible
    to \"snap\" the points manually before generating the font). Both methods have

    to work with the limitations of the coordinate system from the start than to pretent

    and when I discovered the way FontLab works, I had to go in and move each anchor
    (ones that resulted from effects, rounding, etc). I had set up the grip as directed
    by FontLab, but that doesn't cover you in all situations.\r\n\r\nSo I have created
    a script that takes care of the non-integer anchors. If you have already drawn
    your typeface, or don't want to be too concerned with snapping while illustrating,
    this Illustrator script will be perfect for you. It automatically rounds all selected
    anchors to the closest whole integer, whether that means up or down. With a standard
    UPM of 1000, the tweaking is hardly noticeable. With a higher value for more precision,
    the tweaking would be nearly impossible to see. However, it makes it so that your
    art transfers perfectly into FontLab/TypeTool. I know there are some purists who
    will object, but to those of us who are very comfortable in Illustrator, this
    is an invaluabale tool, I believe.\r\n\r\nHere it is: [[http://www.derekweathersbee.com/products/471|TypeBridge]]\r\n\r\nLet
    me know if you have any questions or feedback. (Not hatemail)."
