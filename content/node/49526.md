  staring at it for over an hour. It's not very big so sorry in advance for the eyestrain.\r\n\r\nI
  call your attention to the U, P, and Y. I thought I had it with a Shango/Schneider's
  Initials ID but then the P in the image is a little heavier (I think).\r\n\r\nTHANK
  YOU\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontHelp_5286.jpg]"

  body: "Mariah, it looks like Schneidler Initials to me.\r\nThe reason why the P
    looks heavier (as do the other initial caps) is that it's set up as if it had
    small caps and it's an all cap font.\r\nSo the Initial caps are of a different
    size, making them a bit \"fatter\".\r\nHope this helps."

  body: Ah, thank you Viviane! I really appreciate your help. I didn't think about
    the fact that they manipulated it at all to made it look like small caps, and
    what you said totally makes sense. Excellent, mystery solved. :)
