  body: "Alphabets, bah. In my day we had Morse Code soup. Nothing but noodle dots
    and noodle dashes, and we liked it. By gum, we <em>loved</em> it.\r\n\r\nI quite
    like the newly-revised No Name brand packaging. Some of the products don't have
    an image at all, just big black type. There's something really charmingly straightforward
    about an otherwise featureless bright yellow box that just says \"BREAD CRUMBS\"."
