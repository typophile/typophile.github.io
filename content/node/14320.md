  body: Being a convert from PCs to Macs I always preferred (and still do) the right
    click mouse on a PC. I started to like Macs more, but given that my iMac won't
    start anymore, Macs include virtually no troubleshooting manuals, no diagrams
    detailing how to do simple tasks (like adding RAM) and offer very little MANUAL
    commands in the event of system failure, I'm getting a bit fed up with Apple's
    sleekness. Style means jack if the device doesn't function properly. I'm sure
    at the very least the new mouse will "look cool".

    X is its refusal to give an explanation when an operation fails, particularly
    when copying a file with a name that longer than 32 characters or when trying
    to write to a full disk. A little feedback about the exact nature of the problem
    is always helpful.

    who bought one and this is what he had to say:\r\n\r\n<em>Well so far it's been
    just trying to say something new about what is essentially just a mouse.\r\n\r\nRan
    the installer which required 152mb of space?!! Mighty is not the word.\r\nRestarted
    and set up the preferences to use the scroll ball as Expose--> Show desktop and
    the side buttons to Expose-->Show all windows\r\n\r\nThe scroll ball is quite
    springy in that pressing down. I was expecting it to be quite rigid but any amount
    of force will press it down into it's hole. I would wonder about the durability
    of this as it does seem mounted on a soft spring. The side buttons do require
    a good squeeze between the thumb and ringfinger. The sound they emit is very quiet
    though the scroll ball sound is very realistic\r\n\r\nI have put up the tacking
    speed on everything to it's highest as I like a fast mouse. The right click action
    is identical to the action I use on the intellimouse.\r\nBeen using it in Photoshop/Preview
    in place of the usual spacebar action to move around the document and it works
    well though a bit jerkier.It means a quicker workflow in some instances.\r\n\r\nThe
    short cord is actually good for powerbook users as I use it on the right with
    the cord plugged in on the left hand side. It definitely would be awkard plugging
    it into a g5 under the desk and using it that way.\r\n\r\nAll in all a good mouse
    for creative work but I'll have to road test it a bit more.</em>\r\n\r\nHe's an
