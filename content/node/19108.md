  body: "Palatino bold?\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\nEDIT: Nope, the 'e' and 'c' are most
    definitely wrong. It doesn't seem to be Melior either. This does look like a Hermann
    Zapf face though. Maybe it's one of his own Palatino knock-offs."

  body: "I agree with Lex. This is Zapf Book. The Medium weight is a good guess because
    of the 't' being rather clipped-looking on the top. The heavier weights have a
    funny spike at the top of the 't'. It's hard to predict the effect of added stroke
    thickness unless you try it, but I think Lex got it spot on.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
