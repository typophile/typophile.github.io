    a take on Caslon Black Swash. It's not identical, but if you edit off the top
    left swash on the R, you can see the resemblance. Veer is down at the moment,
    but Jason Walcott has done some similar revivals. I would guess maybe a mix of
    swash and regular caps was used for the RIVERMEN logo.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
