body: "Hi Everyone!\r\n\r\nHas anyone been able to make AFDKO 2.5 work on FontLab
  5.1 on Lion OS?\r\n\r\nI have just upgraded to FontLab 5.2 on Lion OS. I seem to
  have installed AFDKO successfully and the commands are appearing on the Macros menu.
  But oddly, when I try to run any of these commands they just won't run, and nothing
  happens. Does anyone have any clue whether this is due to the OS or the version
  of FontLab?\r\n\r\nThank you in advanced!\r\n"

    invisible. I was then able to copy the scripts properly.
