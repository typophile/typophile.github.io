  opinion as to the best:\r\n\r\nFoundry\r\nFamily / Set\r\nWebsite / Source\r\n\r\nto
  buy it from.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that I have considered investing in an
  entire family, since I've mainly just purchased individual or display fonts up to
  this point.  (Anyone around here knows I'm new to design.)  Thanks in advance for
  your opinions."

  body: "Just my fleeting observation -- Linotype Sabon Next, as drawn by Porchez,
    is a very nice Garamond. But it is not Sabon.\r\n\r\nThe license is a bit hard
    to take, as are all the new Linotype licenses. "

    Garamond]]\r\n\r\nThere were other Sabon versions: Symposia from Compugraphics,
    Sabius from URW, Savoy from URW/Softmaker and Sarone from Castcraft, but their
    current availability is unknown."
