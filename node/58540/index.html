  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi All,

I posted a question a while back about a suitable replacement for Our Bodoni Light for body copy in a Magazine. The whole idea was scrapped for a few months and now I'm having another go at it. The mag is a lifestyle title, focusing on fashion, food, culture, celebrity etc. It targets upper middle class Canadians. I'm looking for something with a vertical axis and a fairly large x-height that doesn't feel too dark on the page as the mag is quite text heavy. I've tried out several other Bodonis and think it's best to stray away from them. We use Trade gothic for headers and captions and I'm having some difficulty finding something that fits. I'm stumped.

Any suggestions??</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Here are some nice vertical-stress fonts: <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/">Scotch Modern</a>, a Walbaum (Storm's <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/walbaum-text/">Walbaum Text</a> is nice if you're looking for something with lower contrast), <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/">Miller</a>, maybe <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/didot/">Didot</a> if you're going very high contrast, <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/worldwide/">Worldwide</a> (but that's probably too heavy), and <a href=http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/whittingham-bq/">Whittingham</a> (another Scotch revival).

Other, slightly crazier ideas include Perpetua (probably x-height too small), Fenice, New Caledonia, or <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/farnham/">Farnham</a> (display weights should be nice and light).

Hope this helps.</div>

...depending on what you're looking for. 

You mentioned tall x-height... Mrs Eaves XL certainly has that in spades. She's Mrs Eaves' "endomorphic" sister. There's also a narrow (mesomorphic?) version.

H&FJ's Chronicle has four grades per weight that let you fine-tune the color.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Michael:

When designing a historically-based typeface as a survey of a genre - in the case of Brunel, the English Moderns released by a number of foundries (including but not limited to the work of the Caslon foundry and John Isaac Drury) between about 1790 and 1850, as Matthew Carter's Miller is a survey of Scotch Romans from a number of different punchcutters - rather than a revival of a specific typeface, one of the main challenges is deciding which divergent forms are worth keeping, and how to prioritize them. It's the same old problem any responsible designer runs into when reviving something old: how do you balance making an accurate record of what existed while making something relevant to contemporary typography?

In the case of the italic v and w, Paul felt that the earlier, more idiosyncratic forms of v and w, which are structurally quite similar to the Transitionals that came just before the first Moderns (i.e. the work of Richard Austin or John Baskerville), were interesting and beautiful, and well worth making the default form in part because they make a statement about the early Moderns, which tended to be much more organic than the later ones. This form was simplified over the following decades into the simpler, more familiar v and w, and we have included those as alternates as well. I'm generally not fond of stuffing fonts full of alternates, because I feel that they can quickly turn into a type designer avoiding making choices about what a typeface should look like, but in this case the alternate v and w seemed necessary, as they were also historically accurate and important.

It is not that I think that the "wild and crazy" w should not have been a part of the font, just maybe in a secondary position... as the alternate. To me as a calligrapher/lettering artist I think they stick out as a sore thumb! Not ugly mind you!  but maybe like a disruptive child in a classroom. Purely and simply subjective on my part... not to cast aspersions. I see a more cohesive flow in the second eg. Especially for text.

Nice work by the way, as always a class act.
