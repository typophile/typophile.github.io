  body: ' Hrant --  <BR> <BR>Thinking about it last night, I realized the same thing
    about your formula: it&#39;s circular. A word like &#34;gypsy,&#34; with 5 letters
    and 4 descenders, comes out equal in score to a word like &#34;preapproving&#34;
    with 12/4.  <BR> <BR>So, are you looking for merely a high proportion of descenders?
    Pygmy and gypsy are 90%. Or are you looking for a long ascenderless word? Perspicaciousness
    is 17, but only 2 descenders. Prepossessing is 13/3. Preapproving and preoccupying
    are both 12/4. That&#39;s the best combination I&#39;ve managed to come up with
    so far.  <BR> <BR>But I&#39;ve been ruling out &#39;t&#39;. I&#39;ll think on

    So, are you looking for merely a high proportion of descenders? <BR> <BR>Originally
    I was looking for a word that has the most descenders both in number as well as
    proportion. So a good equation might have been d^2 &#42; c &#40;instead of c &#42;
    d/c , the original one&#41;, where d is the number of descenders and c the number
    of characters. So &#34;gray&#34; would have scored 16 and &#34;pygmy&#34; would
    have scored 16&#42;5 = 80. <BR> <BR>But that&#39;s too math-y &#40;in this context&#41;,
    so I figured to just settle for the number of descenders, especially since the
    original equation was that anyway. <BR> <BR>&#62; Or are you looking for a long
    ascenderless word? <BR> <BR>No, but it would definitely also be useful to find:
    <BR>1. The longest word with no extenders at all: the word with the smallest height.
    <BR>2. The longest word with the greatest proportion of extenders: the word with
    the greatest height. <BR>&#40;Non-exotic is a big plus.&#41; <BR> <BR>The current
    search is for the word with the lowest &#34;center of gravity&#34;. The word with
    the highest CoG is less interesting, because it&#39;s more in line with general
    behavior of English. I&#39;m looking for aberrations. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    you really are interested in the overall highest score. ;-&#41; Then again, there&#39;s
    Kucera. I don&#39;t know Kucera, but with a name like that, and being &#40;I assume&#41;

    instantaneousness with 17. But that suffix is a little forced. How about inattentiveness
    at 15; the suffix is a little less awkward here. But, okay skip that; there&#39;s

    bets are off. Obviously, the longer the word, the lower it&#39;s likely to score
    on a frequency scale. And without access to this mysterious Kucera, I&#39;m just
    stabbing in the dark. <BR> <BR>Clearly I must have better things to do on a beautiful
