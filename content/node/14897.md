    the ticket.

  body: "Thanks Raph!\r\n\r\nI can't believe it was designed three years ago. I would
    have guessed thirty. Maybe it's based on an older design?\r\n\r\nBTW, I think
    the guy who typeset that vegetarian piece must be a covert meat-product activist
    or something!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Actually, the page on the <a href="http://www.linotype.com/213/carniola-family.html">Linotype</a>
    site says 1993 (12 years ago). The designer, aside from not liking the font very
    much, says, "Carniola is a pastiche of different type designs from the beginning
    of the 20th century, mostly American." So your assessment of a Souvenir/Garamond
    love child is right on the money.
