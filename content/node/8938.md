body: Ok so I have a font with multiple swash alternates and I can&#39;t figure out
  how to make both of them available in InDesign. For example, I have A.swsh and A.swsh02.
  Originaly i had the swsh feature set up so that it would &#34;sub A from [A.swsh
  A.swsh02]&#34; And that only gives me the first alternate, the second shows up in
  the glyph pallette, but will not insert, I only get the first. Then I tried setting
  up the swsh feature so that it would &#34;sub A by A.swsh&#34; and the salt feature
  so that it would &#34;sub A.swsh by A.swsh02&#34; but when i did this, I would only
  get the regular A when i selected the A.swsh02 glyph from the pallette. Is there
  any way to get it to do what i want? maybe it&#39;s in the glyph naming? Any help
  would be appreciated. Thnx.

    for one-to-one-of-many substitutions, and there is no support for the &#60;salt&#62;
    feature. In your situation I would make the subsitution as you originally had
    it <BR> <BR>sub A from [A.swsh A.swsh02] <BR> <BR>because this will make the font
    ready to work in future, when one-to-one-of-many substitutions are supported.
    For now, you will have to rely on the glyph pallette to access the second set
    of swashes. You could hijack another feature, of course, but I don&#39;t recommend
    this.'

  body: What John said. <BR> <BR>My only other route would be, if you have a whole
    bunch of .swsh02 alternates for different letters, and these share something in
    common, it would make sense to use the &#34;stylistic sets&#34; feature instead.
    So you&#39;d have a default swash, and then use &#39;ss01&#39; on top of that
    to access the alternate swashes. Or &#39;ss02&#39; for a different set of alternate
    swashes. &#40;All assuming that there was something that these swashes had in
    common.&#41; <BR> <BR>T

  body: Yay, I got it to work! &#40;I couldn&#39;t access the alternates through the
    glyph pallette the way I had them set up before. The glyph would show in the pallette,
    but not insert&#41; I set the swsh feature so that it would &#34;sub A by A.swsh&#34;
    and then set the salt feature so that it would &#34;sub A from [A.swsh A.swsh02].
    I Thought of making a stylistic set, but I don&#39;t know how to access them in
    InDesign CS &#40;is it possible?&#41;
