    <BR> <BR>But isn&#39;t it Unternehmensberatung Rubow Weber? I&#39;m pretty sure
    Weber&#39;s first name is Rudolf, which leaves me with Rubow. I searched around
    and found a reference to him as &#34;Gerhard.&#34;  ... unless that was Rubow&#39;s
    son or nephew or something. <BR> <BR>I did learn once that everything you read
    on the Internet is not necessarily true, so I&#39;m not going to stand too solidly
    on the &#34;Gerhard&#34; issue.  <BR> <BR>The other founder was Peter Karow &#40;this
    too was gleaned from the Internet&#41;. P, G and R were all definitely on the
    Trajan Column &#40;not gleaned from the Internet!&#41;, so something I&#39;ve
    got going on is certainly askew.

    usage antique means old, but I&#39;ve seen it used in typographical contexts to
    mean something else - in fact I&#39;ve seen different sources attribute contradictory
    meanings to it. <BR>Any one specifically typographical meaning would be required
    to make this the correct answer.

  body: In the case of the sans, the idea was probably that it was formally related
    to antique inscriptions that predated the appearance of the serif. Possibly the
    slabs inherited the nickname for being an equally &#34;unrefined&#34; style? <BR>I
    have no time for the quiz. <BR>Eduardo ID&#39;ed the faces, let him take it.
