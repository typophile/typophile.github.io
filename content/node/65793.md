body: "I'm painting a mural of a few really large letters. It will be in a long, narrow
  hallway, so people will be viewing it largely from an angle.\r\n\r\nI'm planning
  on drawing them expanded so that they can be sort of legible from the other end
  of the hallway and still being legible close-up, but I'm having trouble deciding
  on the degree of expansion. It's easy to calculate how the image that a camera would
  take would be stretched and shrunk, but our eyes compensate for much of that.\r\n\r\nI'm
  going to try a few different degrees of expansion and see how they fare, but I'm
  wondering if there's any sort of rule of thumb for this or where I would look for
  precedents."

  body: I think scale models would be helpful, even one as simple as a drawing on
    a sheet of paper that you view from an angle.

    you need: Project the image of [non-distorted] letters onto the wall at varying
    angles, look/walk up and down down the hallway, and find out when it looks right.'

  body: "Here's one potentially interesting precedent: <a href=\"http://www.l2m3.com/index.php?lang=en&key=projekttypLeitsysteme&id=83\">L2M2:
    Kreissparkasse Ludwigsburg</a>\r\nI like how they employ the rather dramatic effect
    of the distorted letters, combined with a secondary system that is legible from
    up close.\r\n\r\nIf you go too crazy with the perspective/distortion (like <a
    href=\"http://de-war.de/eurekacarpark.html\">here</a>) you win awards but I'd
    be worried about confusing people too much (at least if the stuff *needs* to be
    legible)."

  body: "I made a few scale models and found that very little expansion was actually
    helpful. It's only a couple of letters, so if you can see them at all, you can
    make out what they are.\r\n\r\nI'd seen the garage in one of those design award
    books before, but I'd never looked at the pictures that closely. It's painful.
    And the office is worse! (In a good way)\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to mess with perspective;
    I just want it to be legible from afar.\r\n\r\nI'll look at the letters on roads.\r\n\r\nBut
    considering that expansion didn't seem to matter much, I'll probably decide such
    that the letters fill the space.\r\n\r\nThe height of the wall defines the maximum
    type size. The letters all have round counters, so that combined with the style
    of type leads to the width of a roman weight. Then I can expand the letters and
    make them bolder in order to fill the wall.\r\n\r\nThe space I have is such that
    this should give expand the letters by no more than one width."
