    Can you whip up a bigger/ <BR>clearer sample?'

  body: 'Given the poor quality of the sample, it&#39;s difficult to say for certain,
    but the best match I can find is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/berling/roman/testdrive.html?s=JOSEF%a0STRASSE%a021%a0TELEFON%a0057439&amp;p=24"
    target="_blank">Berling</a>. &#40;Note: Your sample is letterspaced, the MyFonts
    test drive I linked to is not.&#41;  <BR> <BR>The figures have the most clues
    in them, and none of the other characters in Berling contradict your sample. The
    one character that doesn&#39;t look quite right is the T, but I think your sample
    has some kind of double printing/registration problem which is obscuring some
    of the character shapes. The double printing also leads me to think this is actually
    a relatively light typeface like Berling.  <BR> <BR>Everything seems to point
    to Berling, so that&#39;s my answer and I&#39;m sticking with it. <BR> <BR>--Mark,
    wasting time down at the forensics lab again'
