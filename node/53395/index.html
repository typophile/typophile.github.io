  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Dear Typophiles,</p>
<p>Here is the first version of the lowercase alphabet of my first typeface*, Ernestine**. Backstory is <a href="http://typophile.com/node/50670">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have made a little family of bitmap fonts before, but I&rsquo;m not counting this here because Curves Are Hard.
** See below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ernestine_lc_v1-1_5490.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The intended use for this is twofold, my main focus being small text (thanks to Hrant, as well as Hans Jörg Hunziker in class, for bringing this idea to mind); the other, possibly, display: The plan is to first finish this &ldquo;base&rdquo; cut shown above, and then deduce two additional optical sizes from it, which will likely be of more practical use than the base itself. First, an optically corrected small size cut with more weight &amp; looser spacing; intended point size is 3 to 8*. And second, if time permits, a display cut with less weight &amp; more detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some quick experiments with ink traps, opened counters, and the like revealed that this can be surprisingly legible at 3pt, and rather comfortable at 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d be very grateful for crits, and any opinions really. I&rsquo;ve been <em>very</em> immersed in this over the past couple of weeks or so, so I presume I don&rsquo;t really see most of the issues myself. (I must say a monoline typeface really seems to be quite a beast to try to tackle, too.) Spacing btw is still quite preliminary.</p>
<p>** Oh, and the name. Ernestine is the working title that I kind of got stuck on. I think it matches the feel of this rather nicely, but the word looks uh, suboptimal (very long, and somewhat boring) when set in the typeface, so I&rsquo;m open for different naming ideas that would also look good. :-)</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m throwing her out there. Please don&rsquo;t hold back, and don&rsquo;t be gentle for the sake of it: I&rsquo;m trying to learn, and I&rsquo;m wanting to actually make this usable.</p>
<p>—Nina</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good work Nina. I like the thick serifs and especially the readability of this face at the smaller point size (8pt is my favorite).</p>
<p>The ball terminals seem to be more compelling on the &lsquo;k&rsquo;,&lsquo;r&rsquo; and &lsquo;y&rsquo;. For some reason on the &lsquo;c&rsquo;, &lsquo;g&rsquo; and &lsquo;f&rsquo; are not pulling it off as well. I prefer the third &lsquo;g&rsquo; as well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Great to see this. Here are some thoughts. (Keep in mind I&rsquo;m only about one awkward set of caps ahead of you in type-design experience, so take with a grain of salt.)</p>
<p>This is a personable font that is already working well both small and big.</p>
<p>I prefer g #1 as far as fit with the character of the font goes.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something I very much like about the b.</p>
<p>The blunt terminals at the bottom of c, e, s, and t seem too crude. I wonder if there are other solutions.</p>
<p>Least successful are k and s: k because the mismatch of a structural straight arm and an unfurling curve (something sort of Cyrillic looking to this), and s because it&rsquo;s a bit lumpy and struggling to be wide.</p>
<p>In some cases the ball terminals seem too tacked-on, rather than developing gracefully out of a curve. This is particularly true where the curve leading to it is flattening out to reach horizontally, as in c, f, and s most noticeably.</p>
<p>The top join of q seems odd to me - it has no analogues in the other letters that I could find. Did you try it with an intersection like the bottom of b has?</p>
<p>Something about the thickness of the arm of the r doesn&rsquo;t look right to me.</p>
<p>The serifs at the tops of v, w, x, and y seem too heavy. I never thought about it before, but I suppose if you adjust diagonals for optical balance you might have to adjust slab serifs at the ends of them. v and w may be a bit too spread at the bottom, and thus light (topheavy).</p>
<p>I might consider raising the intersection of the y, and maybe bringing the top-right vertex of the z leftward a touch.</p>
<p>Seems to me like this has a great deal of both charm and function - very impressively so for a first font!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>sorry for writing german, i wrote this for german typografie.info, then deciding to add it here for more coherence:</p>
<p>ganz kurz, spontan und unvollständig, und mit Bedacht zu genießen:</p>
<p>das sieht schon sehr sehr ausgewogen und ruhig aus, spitze! Ich wünschte ich hätte den Nerv, so lange am Grundalphabet zu bleiben, bevor ich mich aus Neugierde und Langeweile in Zeichensatz- und Schnitt-Orgien verliere :)</p>
<ul>
<li>die jeweils rechten Teile von y und v, vielleicht auch bei w und x, stechen im PDF in den kleinen Punktgrößen dezent heraus, sind zu dunkel. Das mag am Rendering liegen (PDF-Vorschau von OSX) oder wirklich ein Problemchen sein.</li>
<li>der obere Teil vom &ldquo;k&rdquo; wirkt mir eine Spur zu verspielt. Ich sehe dass das mit dem &ldquo;r&rdquo; korrespondiert, aber dort ist es irgendwie weniger &ldquo;curly&rdquo;. Vielleicht braucht das &ldquo;k&rdquo; eine gerade Serife, keinen Tropfen? Tropfen hängen bei dir sonst immer nur an Rundungen, der Tropfen beim &ldquo;k&rdquo; macht das auch &ldquo;rund&rdquo;, auch wenn&rsquo;s das eigentlich nicht ist.</li>
<li>das &ldquo;s&rdquo; ist mir links oben und rechts unten eine Spur zu eckig. Auch links unten macht es einen recht abrupten Schwenk nach oben. Vielleicht mal neben ein &ldquo;a&rdquo; stellen und wirken lassen. Außerdem ist es oben zu schwer, und/oder in den senkrechten Teilen etwas zu leicht. Für mich (neben dem verfluchten &ldquo;d&rdquo; und den Schrägen) der schwierigste Buchstabe.</li>
<li>das &ldquo;z&rdquo; hat einen leichten Hang nach links.</li>
<li>das &ldquo;u&rdquo; hat im rechten Teil seines Bogens einen leichten Knick, es geht eine Spur zu gerade nach oben.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dinge die vielleicht mit der Industria zu tun haben, die ich natürlich nicht wie du aus dem FF kenne:</p>
<ul>
<li>ich bevorzuge #1 der drei &ldquo;g&rdquo; (ggf. mit etwas weniger gekräuseltem Ohr), wenn das nicht, dann #3. Das mittlere steht in den vertikalen Proportionen zwischen den Stühlen und könnte durch das &ldquo;Schmuckelement sogar fleckig werden. Hier kann man aber sicher auch zwischen Display und kleinem Text streiten &hellip;</li>
<li>das &ldquo;q&rdquo; sieht mir noch am unfertigsten aus. Oben ist es mir eine Spur zu rund, d.h. die Rundung geht rechts eine Spur zu weit nach unten. Die Serife gehört für mich rein gefühlsmäßig genau in die andere Richtung.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for your feed-back guys! Much appreciated.</p>
<p>The ball terminals are one of my big &ldquo;question marks&rdquo; about this. I had a lot more of them at one point (like on the head of the &ldquo;a&rdquo;, and both ends of the &ldquo;s&rdquo;) but realized they close up the shapes too much. Now I don&rsquo;t know if they are too few and far between to still make sense as a principle. Also, it&rsquo;s true they don&rsquo;t work equally well in all their instances – thanks for pointing this out.</p>
<p>Jesse,</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I prefer the third ’g’ as well.&quot;</em>
It seems to come down to the first or the third. While I do heart the second one, I agree it doesn&rsquo;t work very well in text; I&rsquo;ll probably keep it as an alternate for the display cut though. The first is the one most closely following the metal face I was (partly) working off. Only beef I have with the third really is that it keeps reminding me of Souvenir. :-|</p>
<p>Craig,</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The blunt terminals at the bottom of c, e, s, and t seem too crude&rdquo;</em>
Oh … I wonder what could be done about this. I was actually quite happy to come up with this solution; as noted above, I had more ball terminals before, but that was getting too much. Also I felt I needed to add a little weight / &ldquo;determination&rdquo; to the terminal at least in the &ldquo;s&rdquo;, otherwise it was starting to feel top-heavy (and the &ldquo;t&rdquo; keeps toppling over anyway). Hmm.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Least successful are k and s&rdquo;</em>
Yeah, touch me where it hurts! :-)
Those were the ones I was struggling with most. I had no idea how difficult it is to make a &ldquo;k&rdquo; (especially at this kind of width). With the &ldquo;s&rdquo;, I was at least expecting it (which of course didn&rsquo;t make it easier). In any case, I agree those aren&rsquo;t done yet.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The top join of q seems odd to me&rdquo;</em>
That&rsquo;s actually one of the details that carried over from said metal face I was working off; I must say I like that little corner that doesn&rsquo;t say where it&rsquo;s coming from :-). Although I guess I should also try a &ldquo;b&rdquo;-like smooth intersection &amp; compare.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The serifs at the tops of v, w, x, and y seem too heavy&rdquo;</em>
I was noticing some weirdness there too, but must say I feel quite insecure generally with all of those &ldquo;diagonal&rdquo; lettershapes. 
I wonder how much of the impression of excessive serif weight is due to the diagonals, and how much to the fact that they&rsquo;re on the x-height; they&rsquo;re the same weight as the ones sitting on the baseline, but I guess they also look heavier when they&rsquo;re up there. I wonder if I should thin them overall (throughout vwxy) or maybe just on the insides or something?</p>
<p>Sebastian,</p>
<p>Hope you don&rsquo;t mind if I reply in English to &ldquo;tie in&rdquo; your comments with the rest :-).</p>
<p><em>&quot;- die jeweils rechten Teile von y und v, vielleicht auch bei w und x, stechen im PDF in den kleinen Punktgrößen dezent heraus, sind zu dunkel&rdquo;</em>
Do you think this excessive weight on the right hand side of yv/wx might have something to do with the serif weight discussed above? Or is it just the stem weight that&rsquo;s off? (There&rsquo;s something fundamentally wrong with the &ldquo;y&rdquo; in particular that I&rsquo;m still looking to pinpoint. Is it weight?)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Vielleicht braucht das “k” eine gerade Serife, keinen Tropfen?&quot;</em>
Hm – I had a version with a straight serif on the &ldquo;k&rdquo; and it looked like an industrial clamp or something ;-) – although the ball terminal may be too cute (if it works at all).</p>
<p><em>&quot;[q] Die Serife gehört für mich rein gefühlsmäßig genau in die andere Richtung&rdquo;</em>
Interesting. While it may well be unbalanced yet, the <em>principle</em> of having the serif of the &ldquo;q&rdquo; face rightwards feels right to me, and seems to make a lot of sense too*. Does it look very confusing/weird? (Does it look weird to others too?)</p>
<ul>
<li>Readability, stressing of reading direction, disambiguation with &ldquo;p&rdquo;/&ldquo;g&rdquo;. To give credit where credit is due, most of the thought that went into the &ldquo;q&rdquo; serif comes from reading about Hrant&rsquo;s alphabet reform work – and I then kept finding &ldquo;q&quot;s with rightwards-facing terminals/serifs in &ldquo;real life&rdquo; too, and felt they work/read nicely.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Thanks again! This is extremely helpful. Keep&rsquo;em coming. :-)

<p>I do think, if you&rsquo;re going to stick with the ball terminals, that you should have one on the head of the a, too. (I confess that my printout on US Letter paper cut off half that letter so I didn&rsquo;t catch its absence at first.)</p>
<p>One new comment: on the central intersection of the x. It looks like you&rsquo;ve offset the / stroke but not the \ stroke. In a contrast face I think that would work well but here where the strokes are even I&rsquo;d expect the intersection to be more symmetrical, too. As it is, you get a little clockwise torque to that crossing.</p>

<p>Do you guys really think this is better?
<img src="/images/old-images/ernestine-aa_5625.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I was all excited about the left hand shape at first, but chucked out the ball terminal after looking at this in text size. Somehow I felt it was mannered and a bit too &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;; most of all, it seems to stand in the way of readability, especially in smaller sizes. Closes up the counter too much (and looks too dark, given that the &ldquo;a&rdquo; is a pretty dam busy character already). Also, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to make the bowl of the &ldquo;a&rdquo; <em>much</em> smaller, since it&rsquo;d then lose all reasonable proportion, as well as any connection with the eye of the &ldquo;e&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Other points well taken. Craig, thanks for pointing me to the &ldquo;x&rdquo;; I realized while I was making it I really don&rsquo;t know much about &ldquo;x&quot;s. Need to look at some others some more.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;re: c/s/t terminals, I can see why a little added weight serves you well. Could you just soften those corners a little?&quot;</em>
Soften? As in round? Or as in, cut at a different angle?</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The r looks a little weak, too.&quot;</em>
Yeah, that&rsquo;s a defiant little thing that doesn&rsquo;t know if it wants to be straight or curved, and ends up being kind of both (and too light in the process).</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Is that u a little too wide?&quot;</em>
Huh, might be. I just checked and it is narrower than the &ldquo;n&rdquo;, but only a little. I haven&rsquo;t checked its width after changing serif shape/size around a few times, and looking at this I agree it looks wide.</p>
<p>Is the &ldquo;w&rdquo; too narrow btw?</p>

<p>Nina, are you sure this is your first font? :-) Because it&rsquo;s coming together quite well, and has much more depth than a beginner usually shows. Heck, many old-timers just play on the surface their whole careers. It&rsquo;s certainly frightening jumping into that dark, luscious jungle.</p>
<p>For example, the decision of putting a ball on the &ldquo;a&rdquo; or not, of how to do the top-right of the &ldquo;q&rdquo;, these are things that you can either just formally mimic precedent, or really think about first. When I was making Patria I tried to make the letters be what they needed to be in terms of reading, as opposed to just something that other type designers would applaud. I like to leave the terminal of the &ldquo;a&rdquo; pretty &ldquo;weak&rdquo; because I believe it helps readability (without looking ugly - in fact it can look quite elegant and graceful). I think your &ldquo;q&rdquo; however is going in the wrong direction, it&rsquo;s neither attractive nor harmonious. Not the descender mind you - that&rsquo;s wonderful! I mean the top-right. I would try giving it a vertical spike/serif, like in the &ldquo;z&rdquo;. If that doesn&rsquo;t work I might try making it like the &ldquo;b&rdquo; (even though many type design will definitely go &ldquo;uuugh&rdquo;). Divergence is extremely important in a text face, it&rsquo;s just very easy to go too far, and too tempting to do it semi-randomly. You need some method (and you seem to be good at that).</p>
<p>Craig says that the &ldquo;terminals at the bottom of c, e, s, and t seem too crude&rdquo;. I agree, and I think it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re gently flaring (in the &ldquo;a&rdquo; as well). If you make them totally monoline, or maybe even taper gently, I think that might fix it.</p>
<p>The first &ldquo;g&rdquo; is more harmonious, but the third one might be just what the font needs in terms of making its mark. I would make the third one the default and the first the alternate. Don&rsquo;t worry about any Souvenir connection. Oh, and dump the second one.  :-)</p>
<p>The &ldquo;k&rdquo; I actually like very much! And like Spiekermann has said, a love/hate glyph can be a veritable gold-mine! You might need to tweak it later, but I would let it live until there&rsquo;s reason to believe there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>The ball of the &ldquo;r&rdquo; needs to be larger.</p>
<p>The head of the &ldquo;s&rdquo; is recoiling. You might pull it to the right a hair.</p>
<p>The very top of the &ldquo;t&rdquo; is boring. Not sure how to best fix it though.
And I would make the leftward bar flat on the bottom, slanted on the top.</p>
<p>I think I would make the &ldquo;u&rdquo; serifs like the ones in the &ldquo;v&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s one convention that seems to make sense (even though it seems counter-intuitive).</p>
<p>I would make the &ldquo;z&rdquo; serifs longer.</p>
<p>The exclamation mark is way too blah.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I also have some macro crits:
If this is really a text-size cut, and you&rsquo;re planning on making a small-size cut, the problem is this cut is already very wide and large on the body*. If this will be used small, it needs to be darker. If there will be another smaller cut, what&rsquo;s THAT going to look like?! :-)  I&rsquo;m not sure what to recommend, because the large width of this design is part of its charm and character&hellip; Normally I would recommend making a bit narrower. Another way is to shoot for small text with this (and probably give up on making a smaller cut) and make it darker.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Jesse said, it&rsquo;s happy at 8 (and maybe even 7).</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, the vertical proportions are a bit off. Assuming the x-height will stay this size, if this is shooting for small text I would shorten the descenders; if it&rsquo;s shooting for 9-10 point I would lengthen the ascenders.</p>
<p>Nina, this is great stuff - please keep it up!
(But don&rsquo;t forget to eat and breathe.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, thanks for your critique; it&rsquo;s much appreciated.</p>
<p>Depth: I&rsquo;m glad to hear the thought that is behind at least some of this is showing. I generally can hardly do any work without a semi-solid concept. And actually, 
many of the things you criticize are those I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about, but rather &ldquo;assumed&rdquo; as sort of a starting point – like the vertical metrics, for instance.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Divergence is extremely important in a text face, it’s just very easy to go too far, and too tempting to do it semi-randomly.&quot;</em>
Yes! And I find it very hard to tell how much irregularity is OK in terms of doing
what feels right, or what seems to work; and how much <em>must</em> be standardized. 
Like serif size: most of them are slightly longer on the right-hand side, those in 
the more symmetrical and/or busy glyphs are symmetrical, and I have made them significantly longer on the right-hand side of the &ldquo;f&rdquo; and &ldquo;r&rdquo; because I felt these glyphs got stronger / more stable this way – and I have no clue if it&rsquo;s a good idea (theoretically) to work them like this. 
The mysterious convergence of Brain and Gut makes this a very interesting process. :-)</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Selected details: the others aren&rsquo;t forgotten, but on the checklist for the next round.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I like to leave the terminal of the “a” pretty “weak”…&quot;</em>
I didn&rsquo;t consciously realize this before, but I like Patria&rsquo;s &ldquo;a&rdquo; a lot. 
As well as the one in Constantia (which is also &ldquo;weak&rdquo;).</p>
<p>&ldquo;g&rdquo;: It&rsquo;s awful, but I&rsquo;ve realized I don&rsquo;t <em>like</em> the third one. We&rsquo;re just not friends. 
I&rsquo;ll search for this shape some more. Maybe something between the first and the third one, with the join of the descender at an intermediate angle, might be interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;k&rdquo;: I&rsquo;m glad to hear you like this one! Because I&rsquo;ve decided I do like it, 
and hope to be daring enough to keep it (or something conceptually close to it). :-)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The very top of the “t” is boring. Not sure how to best fix it though.&quot;</em>
Maybe something like this? (Please try to ignore the ugly bottom.)
<img src="/images/old-images/taper-t_4747.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think I would make the “u” serifs like the ones in the “v”. That’s one convention that seems to make sense (even though it seems counter-intuitive).&quot;</em>
Huh. Extremely counter-intuitive. I&rsquo;ll have to play around with that.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>On the macro level: You know, I have no idea what this cut should do. In fact, 
I don&rsquo;t really think of it as doing something, more as being the &ldquo;master design&rdquo;
of sorts; like a cell that hasn&rsquo;t differentiated, &amp; can still grow into something really small, or something really large. But that may not make that much sense as a plan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I guess it&rsquo;s definitely not for standard text sizes (I just honestly can&rsquo;t picture anyone using this at 11 or 12pt, and yes I&rsquo;m reluctant to make it narrower). I agree it feels quite happy at around 8; so how about I make this the base cut for say 7–10, and then derive one for 3–6 (I do want to see how low I can go with this). Does that make sense?
(Because the &ldquo;tiny&rdquo; cut needs traps, and if there&rsquo;s something I loathe in type, 
it&rsquo;s visible ink traps at larger point sizes. And the traps I&rsquo;ve experimented with 
are visible at 10.)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If there will be another smaller cut, what’s THAT going to look like?! :-)&quot;</em>
Hey, remember the downright absurd proportions (I called them &ldquo;funky&rdquo; back then!) of <a href="http://typophile.com/node/50670">that metal face</a>? :-)
Seriously though: I&rsquo;d like the &ldquo;tiny&rdquo; cut not to look substantially wider than this, just slightly heavier. Though I don&rsquo;t know yet if I can make that work.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m letting this rest for a couple more days, as I&rsquo;m currently facing a heap 
of (other) work; I&rsquo;m planning to get back to working on it in the weekend, 
and hoping to post a revision maybe next week. No worries: This is my project 
for the Zurich course after all, so I&rsquo;ll need to finish <em>something</em> by June!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not that petrified of the jungle anymore. After all, I&rsquo;m armed with coffee, 
chocolate, and beer. And I feel like I&rsquo;m at least beginning to see a path.
And it&rsquo;s great to have Typophile! (Especially now that school&rsquo;s on spring break.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Nina
I saw this one starting off on your blog and like the direction you&rsquo;re taking. 
The tapered hood of your a looks great; not too noticeable but keeps the lightness and openness you want. My solution would have probably been to raise the terminal up more horizontal, to keep the line thickness even, but that would have destroyed the shape of the glyph completely. The tapering will really help your s.
I prefer the souvenir g, but do see what happens when you mix it with the first one, with the tail starting between those two versions.
The k doesn&rsquo;t work for me, but it&rsquo;s not the curl, it&rsquo;s the crossbar&hellip;for me it&rsquo;s too wide and I&rsquo;d bring the knee in a notch or two. Would that do odd things to the angle of the arm and leg?
You&rsquo;re right about monolines being the most difficult! I haven&rsquo;t ventured into them yet. Good luck! :)
I&rsquo;m also a beginner so</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, guys! I&rsquo;m glad to hear this terminal works for people other than me too; 
I am quite happy with the way it seems to unify the letterform to appear like more of a consciously designed whole, if that makes any sense (though I know that bowl is still lumpy).
Also, I honestly wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to work.  :-&gt;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be an interesting process to work the different offending terminals in such a fashion; without the added weight of a flaring terminal, I expect quite a few letters to fall apart (like the &ldquo;s&rdquo; and the &ldquo;t&rdquo;), which is probably a good thing because it&rsquo;ll show me how they don&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Ben: Thanks for your comments! 
Re the &ldquo;a&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m finding it pretty difficult not to make the shapes too angular &amp; 
still make them fit into these wide proportions. I would indeed rather keep this kind of curvy.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The k doesn’t work for me, but it’s not the curl, it’s the crossbar&hellip;for me it’s too wide and I’d bring the knee in a notch or two.&quot;</em>
Interesting. To be honest, I was actually wondering if I had to make it wider. 
Need to look at this in context / some more / seriously / … :-)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Would that do odd things to the angle of the arm and leg?&quot;</em>
It probably would, though I&rsquo;d have to test. As it stands, at least the angle of the arm corresponds (roughly) to the &ldquo;x&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I’m also a beginner so&rdquo;</em>
Wow… did you fall asleep mid-sentence? :-)</p>

<p>What about trying to make the crossbar on the k flow into the lower leg, smoothly, as a curve? I think that might harmonise better with the ball terminal and help keep the overall texture curvy, which seems to be your direction.</p>

(Also, new PDF up top: ernestine_lc_v2.)</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that trying to work out a cut that isn&rsquo;t supposed (or capable) 
to do anything by itself is too abstract for me to figure out (and also started feeling kind of pointless). So, I am shooting for 8–10 with this – which seemed 
to necessitate some rather deep changes. (I&rsquo;m keeping the old contours, though, 
as a possible starting point for an eventual small size cut.)</p>
<p>Since this starts off in a bit of a new/refined direction, which also seems a bit scary, I&rsquo;d love some feed-back before diving into all the detail refinements that I&rsquo;m aware this needs. 
I have done quite a bit of detail work, but most of that was <em>before</em> re-thinking proportions, darkness, and contrast. So I concede the old version has more even color than the new, but I&rsquo;m hoping that&rsquo;s just due to the fact I haven&rsquo;t done nearly as much detail tweaking on the new one yet. Also, spacing is still quite basic. 
I&rsquo;m also aware that the weights are still kind of all over the place, and they seem to behave pretty unpredictably when printed small-ish. I guess this isn&rsquo;t a project I can pull off with my 600 dpi laser printer; I&rsquo;m hoping to be able to buy a better one soon (which is one reason why I&rsquo;d rather not start out with the small size cut yet).</p>
<p>So I guess the most important question is: Does this make sense? 
(= Does it read better, or at least promise to do so after further tweakage?)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this new direction runs me into a slew of new problems I&rsquo;m not even seeing yet (yay! and I mean that). Don&rsquo;t hold back. I&rsquo;m really trying to learn and understand what makes a text face work; and I&rsquo;m up for redoing &amp; changing this until it can do what I need it to (as long as I can sometimes still find time to sleep, and do the work that feeds me).</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Some detail notes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;q&rdquo;: I couldn&rsquo;t make it work with a vertical serif on top. That thing kept looking tacked on, kept messing with the bowl in ways I didn&rsquo;t appreciate, and I couldn&rsquo;t really see why it&rsquo;d <em>need</em> to be there. So, here&rsquo;s a &ldquo;q&rdquo; with a join like in the &ldquo;b&rdquo;, 
and it&rsquo;s actually one of my very favorite glyphs! So, I&rsquo;m officially challenging 
all of you (except for Hrant I guess) to go &ldquo;uuugh&rdquo;, and then tell me why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;g&rdquo;: The other one has not been voted off the show, I just haven&rsquo;t adapted it yet.</p>
<p>Hrant:
<em>&ldquo;I think I would make the &lsquo;u&rsquo; serifs like the ones in the &lsquo;v&rsquo;.&quot;</em>
I officially don&rsquo;t get this.  :-{  I tried making them flat on top and angled on the bottom, and that looked positively weird, especially next to glyphs like &ldquo;i&rdquo; or &ldquo;n&rdquo; where I&rsquo;d expect the same serif shape. It kind of makes the &ldquo;u&rdquo; look like a flipped &ldquo;n&rdquo;, or like it&rsquo;s hanging from the x-height rather than standing solidly. Or did you mean something else? I&rsquo;m confused.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very grateful for any pointers, opinions and crits. I&rsquo;ll let this hang around* for a few days – and am looking forward to then resuming work on it in full blast. :-)</p>

<p>Your strategy of getting right to a target size design is sound, and the helpful side-by-side comparison demonstrates at a glance how well the revised design is fulfilling that function. Even on my likewise low-res printer&rsquo;s version, it&rsquo;s impressive to see that the charming character comes through at small sizes while remaining perfectly legible.</p>
<p>Here are the things I would (or might) take another look at:</p>
<p>c/e/s : I sung the praises of this taper before, but I wonder if starting the taper a little later (letting the bottoms of these letters stay thick a little longer) would serve you well. At small sizes the c and e lose that end and look like they have an overbite. s actually winds up looking inverted: maybe reconsider the relative width of the counters as well as shortening the taper? (All that said, s&rsquo;s curves have picked up a lot of grace since v.1.)</p>
<p>g : might be a little too prominent. Does the tail reach around too far? Maybe also consider reducing the scale of the entire upper bowl by lifting it up off the baseline? (I&rsquo;m not sure but I think that the bottom of that bowl need not align with b, q, etc.)</p>
<p>q : yes, it&rsquo;s quirky, but if you&rsquo;re going to let the foppish k into the party, maybe you can&rsquo;t say no to the nice bald guy, too!</p>
<p>v/w/x/y : relative stroke weights on these diagonal letters need work. In general these don&rsquo;t have near the same confidence as the rest of the alphabet. I wonder if w might be a touch too wide. The / stroke of x is too thin, and the optical offset isn&rsquo;t lining up for me (but obviously fix the former first).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed with your patience on this, getting one thing right before moving on to the next.</p>
<p>(and jealous of the hanging space!)</p>

<p>Great - go for it. But you need more weight.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;q&rdquo;: love it.
The &ldquo;u&rdquo;: don&rsquo;t sweat it - do your thing.</p>
<p>Looking at the PDF:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of your ball terminals are malformed (like the &ldquo;r&rdquo;).</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d make the &ldquo;g&rdquo; narrower, and pull in the rightward bulge of the descender. And that ear isn&rsquo;t working.  :-(</li>
<li>The dot of the &ldquo;j&rdquo; is slightly right.</li>
<li>The spine of the &ldquo;s&rdquo; is bumpy and unorthodox. I would go traditional and have the most weight towards the middle.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;t&rdquo;: the head is confused, and the bottom curl needs work.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;w&rdquo;: you need more weight in the middle &ldquo;v&rdquo;.</li>
<li>I think the &ldquo;x&rdquo; has too much stroke contrast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep at it - this is going to end well!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for your feed-back, Craig &amp; Hrant!</p>
<p>Regarding the tapers: I&rsquo;m glad I put them in, but I might be overdoing that. 
As well as this:
&ldquo;<em>Is the modulation ruining things?</em>&rdquo;
I hope not. Though I&rsquo;ve been wondering too.
But while I&rsquo;m working out the weight, I&rsquo;ll try out different degrees of modulation 
as well. I guess I will eventually have to make a decision to push either practicality at the expense of character, or the other way round. (I&rsquo;m slowly beginning to understand your <a href="http://typophile.com/node/50153?page=1">statement</a>, Hrant, a few months ago that &ldquo;trying to make a font some sort of &lsquo;ultimate&rsquo; always ends in tears.&quot;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad nobody has objected to the narrower proportions (yet). They do seem to read better (plus make it a <em>hint</em> less <em>impossible</em> to make certain glyphs work, which is also nice).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be working on the details / individual glyphs both of you mentioned, most of which is touching me right where it hurts :-). I&rsquo;m quite uncomfortable with all those diagonals (vwxyz), the &ldquo;s&rdquo; is driving me nuts from a technical perspective 
(I was actually trying to make the spine heaviest in the middle!), and the &ldquo;t&rdquo; is just confusing me – I can&rsquo;t seem to figure out what matters in that strange little letter, &amp; how it relates to others (most significantly the top).</p>
<p>The ball of the &ldquo;r&rdquo; was sort of an experiment to make it clog less at smaller sizes (well, and on my printer) and still have it be kind of pronounced – though I admit it looks quite silly.  :-)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I’m impressed with your patience on this, getting one thing right before moving on to the next.&quot;</em>
Craig, that ain&rsquo;t patience. But you may call me obsessive, or a control freak. 
Both of which feel rather futile in the face of this!</p>
<p>Hanging space: Magnetic wall paint rocks for flexibility. It&rsquo;s not like Ernestine is always allowed to take up <em>all</em> that space.  ;-)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Little interim musing: I&rsquo;m beginning to think I&rsquo;ve tried to cram too much into this one (and first) font. Too many ideas – and concepts too complex, of which I&rsquo;m honestly just beginning to grasp some nebulous contours.
Thinking about going back to more basic principles, I can see that modulation die. Mostly because I don&rsquo;t truly understand modulation. And I can&rsquo;t help feeling like an impostor when I try to make this font speak in tones that aren&rsquo;t mine, or that I can&rsquo;t master, or that I don&rsquo;t understand. In fact, being on a Beginner&rsquo;s Steep Learning Curve makes this process pretty crazy – many ideas that give me the warm buzz of accomplishment one week seem plainly deficient the next.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be at least two weeks until I&rsquo;ll resume work on this! 
In a way, I can&rsquo;t wait; but I will. :-)</p>

Archer: In the beginning I was looking at it a lot, though not so much anymore. But I guess the combination of slab serifs + ball terminals is more or less automatically reminiscent of Archer.</p>

Font psychology aside: A little temporal distance really seems to make v.2 look pretty cramped.</p>
<p>This time, before I spend forty hours cooking up an whole new alphabet, and derail somewhere along the way without noticing, I&rsquo;d like to throw a few preliminary new glyphs out there that show the changes I&rsquo;ve been thinking about. Those are mainly</p>
<ul>
<li>making it monoline</li>
<li>making it heavier (&amp; with thicker serifs too)</li>
<li>and a little bit wider again (but not so wide as to be uncomfortable at text sizes – still aiming for let&rsquo;s say 8–11 with this).
There is also a new attempt at a &ldquo;g&rdquo;, and I must say I dig this one!</li>
<li>vertical metrics aren&rsquo;t quite sorted out yet.</li>

<p>Alex, thanks! I hadn&rsquo;t thought about a monowidth; but I&rsquo;ve heard quite a few comments that this has a &ldquo;nice typewriter feel&rdquo;. I might give it a shot once this is finished.

<ul>
<li>Here you&rsquo;ve moved from ~8 to 9-10 point size.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would give this warning however: you&rsquo;ve moved pretty firmly into the &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; sphere (even with that &ldquo;g&rdquo;) whereas before it had a distinct and arguably nicely anachronistic flavor. This move will make the font more versatile, but also perhaps less memorable. Considering this is only your&hellip; second :-) outline font I actually think this is a very good move. You can revert to a more old-school version later - and in fact having the two (daughter and mother?) would make for a nice subtle contrast, the sort we don&rsquo;t have enough of in type.</p>
<p>BTW, am I noticing that you&rsquo;ve made the tittle a hair &ldquo;too&rdquo; dark? Is that

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Hrant! I&rsquo;m very glad to hear you say that. Figuring out darkness and vertical proportions has seemed especially hard to figure out, so it&rsquo;s great to hear this may work. (There is no &ldquo;talus&rdquo; however. So I guess I should scale the whole thing down. :-/)</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t <em>consciously</em> trying to make it more contemporary-looking; that kind of happened, and I like it. But, I love your idea about the &ldquo;old&rdquo; and &ldquo;new&rdquo; sort of &ldquo;family&rdquo;! It&rsquo;s a pretty exciting thought to come back to this later and try to play a subtle variation with a slightly more &ldquo;historical&rdquo; feel. Though of course right now I&rsquo;d have no idea how to go about it; that sort of subtlety is way beyond me. But I&rsquo;ll definitely keep this in mind for when I&rsquo;ve done another twenty fonts or so. ;-)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;you’ve made the tittle a hair “too” dark? Is that a Patria influence?&quot;</em>
Really, would that be considered <em>too</em> dark? I realize it is rather large, but it looks good to me that way. Not sure if it&rsquo;s directly influenced by Patria – I&rsquo;ve been partial to larger tittles for a while :-&gt; – but Patria has certainly strengthened my conviction that they can look dam good.
Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been seeing a lot of Patria lately, so I won&rsquo;t be surprised to see some elements of it crop up in Ernestine. One thing that is consciously informed by Patria is the ear of the &ldquo;g&rdquo;, although rather subtly so. (And I do see what you mean about its height.)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Be prepared for the flack from other type designers.&quot;</em>
With that &ldquo;q&rdquo; and that &ldquo;k&rdquo; (and maybe the &ldquo;a&rdquo;), I&rsquo;m not expecting to be taken down over the tittle. What&rsquo;s the problem – does it just look bad to some, or is there one of those underlying minefields I&rsquo;m not seeing?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just another symptom of misguided Modernism, wanting

<p><em>&ldquo;It’s just another symptom of misguided Modernism, wanting to goddam “harmonize” everything.&quot;</em>
I&rsquo;ve been wondering if this attitude might be furthered by the fact that many type designers see to come from graphic design (not entirely excluding myself there). Though that&rsquo;s still quite a half-baked theory.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You just have to keep everything under the radar of the reader.&quot;</em>
Which from my experience even Patria, which may look rather extreme to some of &ldquo;us&rdquo;, does extremely well.</p>
<p>Anyway, about Ernestine: I&rsquo;ll work on those other letters and post a full alphabet with PDF in due time. Cheers!</p>

<p>Tittle: Craig, I think so too. 
I thought it was already on the largish side, and didn&rsquo;t want to make it completely indecent; but I&rsquo;ll gladly try making it a bit larger still!</p>
<p>&ldquo;g&rdquo;: Hrant, thanks for that! That little thing has been a difficult detail. Making it abrupt is an interesting idea; gonna try that.
Craig: I haven&rsquo;t done anything really in the way of optical correction of the join yet – actually the shapes aren&rsquo;t even merged. You might see some overlap artifacts in the PDF.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This new g does contemporize this font - I wonder if it’s no longer an “Ernestine”&hellip;&quot;</em>
Interesting.* Does &ldquo;Ernestine&rdquo; sound more old-fashioned than this looks?</p>
<ul>
<li>I say that because the &ldquo;g&rdquo; is shamelessly influenced by the Heavy weight of Kabel, which after all is a pretty old design (though not quite as old as my original &ldquo;Industria&rdquo;).</li>

See, they are cousins of sorts! Funny. Now I only need to find out who Patria is in that family. Possibly the godfather? And Archer &amp; Caecilia the aunts? :-&gt;
(They&rsquo;re all pretty young either in spirit or actual age or both, so I guess that works. Not sure who among them knits, though!)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So I knitted a new tittle and played around with the &ldquo;g&rdquo; a bit.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/honigm_2a_6201.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>&ndash;
(PDF here: <a href="http://altaira.de/posted/ernestine_honigmohn_2.pdf">http://altaira.de/posted/ernestine_honigmohn_2.pdf</a>)</p>
<p>The tittle feels really indulgent now. I&rsquo;ll confess I like that; but I&rsquo;m wondering if I&rsquo;m overdoing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure about that ball on the &ldquo;g&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m thinking it may need to be larger, but then it starts seriously closing up the tail at smaller sizes, which I don&rsquo;t want it to do. Kind of reminds me of the &ldquo;a&rdquo;. I might try making one without a ball – but in a way I don&rsquo;t want to give up on the few ball terminals that are left.</p>
<p>BTW, feedback from a few of my type design class peeps today showed that the &ldquo;g&rdquo; <em>is</em> a love/hate glyph. I like that. I was beginning to worry this font was getting boring. :-&gt;</p>

I wanted to express Ernestine had taken a nicer direction, if possible: she looks really great and very exciting.
About the g, I&rsquo;d keep it as is in the current pretty version, though I&rsquo;d like to see how it looks with a larger ball, since optically it seems small a bit against, let&rsquo;s say, the c (it&rsquo;s a subjective appreciation, for sure).
I assume you&rsquo;ve not completely spaced it, otherwise the &ldquo;go&rdquo; kerning would need to be revised (below I read &ldquo;mig o&rdquo;):
<img src="/images/old-images/migo_4576.png" alt="">
I&rsquo;m [[http://typophile.com/node/54942|dealing with the g]] right now, and think it&rsquo;s amazing the synthesis you&rsquo;ve achieved in yours.
Who could say such a young lady is boring?</p>

I&rsquo;m happy that this seems to be clicking!</p>
<p>Craig, about the &ldquo;g&rdquo;: I&rsquo;m not sure I need everyone to find the &ldquo;g&rdquo; of their dreams in this font. Imagine Meta having an alternate &ldquo;g&rdquo;. (Or does it? I don&rsquo;t have it.) Or Kabel! Those are basically defined by their &ldquo;g&quot;s, some people hate them, others love them. I think that&rsquo;s great.
Which doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ve decided against making an alternate. But I guess I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s vital for the font.</p>
<p>Marcelo, I was chuckling before when I realized we&rsquo;re both quite involved with the &ldquo;g&rdquo; right now. 
Spacing: There is none. It&rsquo;s horrid. I know I should at least have something like preliminary spacing, but I feel I need more glyphs first to work out the sidebearings.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;though I’d like to see how it looks with a larger ball, since optically it seems small a bit against, let’s say, the c&rdquo;</em>
? I don&rsquo;t have a current &ldquo;c&rdquo; yet. Are you comparing this to the old one up top?</p>
<p><em>Actually, yes, I agree the ball should be larger.

<p>BTW, I just realized something: I don&rsquo;t think the &ldquo;m&rdquo; needs
to be so narrow; it detracts from the character of the face.</p>

<p>Thanks Hrant. There&rsquo;s definitely some weirdness where the ball terminal is connecting; the inner &amp; outer contours seem disharmonious right next to it. On the other hand, you&rsquo;re right that when I do make it completely monoline it looks clogged. Will need to play with that some more. 
&ldquo;m&rdquo;: Its proportions have carried over pretty much from previous iterations, and to be honest I haven&rsquo;t given them too much thought yet. So that&rsquo;s on the list too – thanks.</p>
<p>By the way, every time I look at that &ldquo;i&rdquo;, the tittle seems to be off to one side, but it&rsquo;s never the same side twice. Dunno.</p>

<p>My eyes prefer it that way :-) All of the text faces I really like seem to have the tittle just slightly to the right of optical center, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m alone. (Jenson&rsquo;s is quite far to the right.)</p>

<p>Craig: I just went through all possible options on my printer and think I&rsquo;ve actually found a way to print 10pt text. So the tail looks OK, but you&rsquo;re right about the foot serifs sort of &ldquo;poking into&rdquo; the counterspace. I suspect this may be alleviated once I start working on spacing – the pokey serifs might be a bit too close to the &ldquo;g&rdquo; now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sincerity&rdquo; is a good word, Hrant – I agree pretty much completely with your perspective. 
I like &ldquo;Ernestine&rdquo; because while the name is feminine, it derives more or less directly from &ldquo;earnest&rdquo;. Both of those sides seem to match the font well – in relative terms; I think it <em>is</em> more of a &ldquo;she&rdquo; than a &ldquo;he&rdquo;, although definitely not &ldquo;girly&rdquo; – and yes it&rsquo;s meant to be serious in a, well, earnest kind of way, which doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t be quirky here and there and have its own mind about things. It&rsquo;s just not whimsical.
Plus, I like the &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; between the old-fashioned name and the newish design.
(And I can definitely see Leonard Cohen as a slab. Just not Archer. :-D )</p>
<p>Actually, the more I think of it, I think I&rsquo;m quite married to the name. Guess I&rsquo;ll just have to live without a &ldquo;g&rdquo; in there! But questioning it was worth it.</p>

<p>First, more work on the &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;m&rdquo;:
<img src="/images/old-images/naming-a-m_5056.gif" alt="">
I think I like the new widths/proportions, although I&rsquo;m not sure the new &ldquo;a&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t disappearing a bit between all those wide glyphs. That&rsquo;ll surely be easier to judge once I have things like the &ldquo;s&rdquo;, &ldquo;f&rdquo;, and &ldquo;t&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Btw, going back to Industria, I realized I really like the foot terminal on its &ldquo;a&rdquo;:
<img src="/images/old-images/industria-a-terminal_5790.jpg" alt="">
…so I spent some time playing around with an alternate &ldquo;a&rdquo; that would have a &ldquo;curved&rdquo; terminal that would still be perceived as serifed (kind of like in Patria); but I couldn&rsquo;t get that to work with the overall serif size/weight. And a plain curve, like say in National, seemed too soft and cute in this context. I guess the idea might be moot in a slab (and it&rsquo;s not like I actively dislike the current foot serif on the &ldquo;a&rdquo;).</p>
<p>What I did do was transfer the more slanted inside angle of the &ldquo;a&rdquo; foot serif to the top-left of &ldquo;m&rdquo; and &ldquo;n&rdquo;,* which I think works well – this way I need to taper the curves less as they&rsquo;re approaching the join, which helps the monoline look.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can see that in the topmost image of this post, though only in the &ldquo;m&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Also, I have a first &ldquo;postable&rdquo; version of &ldquo;b&rdquo;/&ldquo;d&rdquo;/&ldquo;p&rdquo;/&ldquo;q&rdquo;: 
(Please ignore the ugly &ldquo;u&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not supposed to be here yet.)

<p>New letters look great. The serifless bowls of &lsquo;b&rsquo; and &lsquo;q&rsquo; work well with your &lsquo;g&rsquo; in style, I think.</p>
<p>I like the reasoning behind the new angles on the insides of those serifs. Perhaps the angle could be hair more upright; you&rsquo;re approaching a thinness that makes those serifs look like they could break off. Or alternatively perhaps keeping the angle but just sliding that line a touch away from the serif (of course it has to align well with the stem on the other side of the join).</p>
<p>Salt to taste!</p>

<p>Yeah, I wonder about that &ldquo;a&rdquo;. Type design seems to be something I can only do in brief and somewhat isolated spurts – having looked at this for a few continuous hours, I can&rsquo;t really tell what&rsquo;s up with the &ldquo;a&rdquo;. But I did narrow it quite a lot, so that may well have been too much. Will try some variations on that.</p>
<p>I like the angled serifs but see your point about them &ldquo;breaking off&rdquo;; this is also an obvious (and visible) breach of the &ldquo;monoline&rdquo; premise, but I must say I&rsquo;m somewhat intrigued by that. Will play around with them some more!</p>
<p>I wonder if the &ldquo;d&rdquo; is too light. But I still don&rsquo;t trust my new printer…</p>

About the b/d/p/q: it seems like the &ldquo;p&rdquo; is missing the &ldquo;movement&rdquo; present in the others; the &ldquo;q&rdquo; is nicely pendulous (the &ldquo;d&rdquo; seems close, but might need a flatter top) and the &ldquo;b&rdquo; is nicely perky, while the &ldquo;p&rdquo; seems totally straight (even though it might not be mathematically).</p>
<p>Revisiting the &ldquo;i&rdquo;: I think you should raise the tittle. It depends on the &ldquo;t&rdquo; though (as well as the cap height - concerning which I&rsquo;m getting a strong vibe that your caps should be short and unusually wide).</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I’m getting a strong vibe that your caps should be short and unusually wide&rdquo;</em>
Ha. Interesting! I was just thinking about what my caps might look like yesterday, and caught myself wondering about making them rather short (which would probably require them to be quite wide). Wouldn&rsquo;t hurt for German I guess. :-)</p>

<p>I would still add weight, probably by moving that line rightward a bit. As is, the head serif looks a bit like a flag on a pole, rather than sharing the slabby solidity of the other serifs. But again, this may just be me!</p>

<p>Craig, your point about solidity is interesting – I do see what you mean.
I wonder, does the &ldquo;p&rdquo; work better for you than the &ldquo;m&rdquo; and &ldquo;n&rdquo;? That join is higher, so there is more black to hold the serif together with the rest of the glyph.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;BTW, are you pulling a Patria…&quot;</em>
Huh, not consciously, though I opened Patria at least five times again tonight (but mostly related to the &ldquo;j&rdquo;), so it&rsquo;s creeping deeper into my brain. Come to think of it, most of the time I can&rsquo;t really tell how much of Ernestine is influenced by which other fonts. Like the &ldquo;a&rdquo;: I only <em>consciously</em> realized I love Patria&rsquo;s sans-top-terminal &ldquo;a&rdquo; after I decided to make mine &ldquo;weak&rdquo; on top; but it&rsquo;s still quite likely that Patria&rsquo;s &ldquo;a&rdquo; somehow registered with me previously.
Out of curiosity, for you, is it more good, or worrying, or just weird to wonder how much of Patria is in this?</p>
<p><em>&quot;…with that huge eye?&quot;</em>
Hm, I was trying to make it match the bowl of the &ldquo;a&rdquo;. 
Actually, I was mostly thinking I was pulling a (slight) Ezzo on the &ldquo;e&rdquo;, in the way it curves out and up on the right side.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;u: I ain’t seein’ nothin’.&quot;</em>
Good.  :-)</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s ideal. As long as that&rsquo;s &ldquo;font<strong>s</strong>&rdquo;, plural, for two reasons: the more numerous your influences the better your results; and you&rsquo;re less likely to offend a single source&rsquo;s author. In my case however the latter does not apply at all - to me it&rsquo;s mostly very flattering.</p>
<p>FWIW, some people say &ldquo;Hey, Cheltenham!&rdquo; when they see Patria&rsquo;s caps. The first time I heard that I was taken aback - but I shouldn&rsquo;t have been: although I didn&rsquo;t reference ol' Chelt consciously, it is in fact one of the fonts I fell in love with early on (although now I&rsquo;ve mostly moved on).</p>
<p>That Ezzo &ldquo;e&rdquo; style is quite nice - and nothing like Patria&rsquo;s BTW: my &ldquo;e&rdquo; has a very hard nose, with a totally straight vertical segment at the tip - I got that (partly) from Jens Gehlhaar (who once produced an extreme incarnation of that structure).</p>

I probably forgot a few.
Plus, there&rsquo;s a definite influence from typewriter fonts, although I don&rsquo;t usually look at these actively. But I originally learned to read and write with a mechanical typewriter, so that stuff is about as deeply rooted in my system as it gets. (-:</div>

<p>I agree the stems look a fraction too dark for the bowls. I think j only needs a bit more work on the curve, perhaps a little bit of a wider base to open up the darkness there.</p>

<p><em>Gonna look at the weight on those rounds. Or the straights.</em>
In a fleeting glimpse, it&rsquo;s quickly noticeable, say, in your &ldquo;d&rdquo;, that the width of the stem and the top serif apparent weight are optically  higher than those of the bowl, at least for my &ldquo;senior&rdquo; vision. Again, in your pleasant hard-worked &ldquo;a&rdquo;, straights are heavier than rounds (always talking on their –being redundant– vertical width). Actually, the stress in the bowl is negative (in red) respect to the stem.
<img src="/images/old-images/ernes_4012.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>“j”: I do think that descender needs more work, but I’m not sure how to do it.</em>
Probably it needs just a little more air to let the ball &ldquo;float&rdquo; more freely –I think of the nice way you solved the end of the loop of your &ldquo;g&rdquo;, or the opposite in your &ldquo;c&rdquo;.
<img src="/images/old-images/ernes1_6410.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>“u”: I wonder if anyone notices the funny thing I did to this.</em>
As Hrant says, I see nothing, except for the not exactly vertical left stem (Adobe&rsquo;s PostScript will hate you ;-) ). The only thing that seems odd a bit –depending on how much I put my eyes on &ldquo;her&rdquo;– is a slightly shortness in the right top serif, that mathematically is not.
<img src="/images/old-images/ernes2_5367.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is something disturbing for me in your &ldquo;e&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m right –<em>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m not sure</em> :-) –, perhaps some flatness in the tail (maybe I like too much your &ldquo;c&rdquo;):
<img src="/images/old-images/ernes3_4370.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Is the &ldquo;h&rdquo; wide a little?</p>

<p>&ldquo;u&rdquo;: Yeah, what I meant is the left side being off-vertical by like 2 units. Kind of an act of desperation – that side kept optically slanting out, until I physically slanted it in. Does it work? Oh, and Marcelo, why will PS hate me for that? Hinting stuff?
Btw, the right-side serif is slightly longer than the left, but I guess it may need more!</p>
<p>&ldquo;j&rdquo;: I like the idea of &ldquo;giving it a bit more air&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll try that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;e&rdquo;: Marcelo, that looks quite good! I had a variant with a less-flat bottom, but couldn&rsquo;t really get it to work nicely – it seemed to close up too much. I&rsquo;ll play around with this some more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;h&rdquo;: I think, I think, I agree! But I&rsquo;m stumped as to why it should be looking wide. The &ldquo;n&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t, is it?</p>
<p>Weights: I&rsquo;ll need some time to figure this out. It&rsquo;d be a lot easier obviously to reduce weight on the straights than to add some on the rounds, but I don&rsquo;t want to make it too light overall.</p>

<p><em>Marcelo, why will PS hate me for that?</em>
Just kidding. That&rsquo;s coz the way PostScript manages printing: when near to vertical or horizontal, but not exactly, the interpreter has to make a lot of decisions about what to do, that is, if inking or not; the digital world is discrete, while the analogous is not; aliansing is the gap where noise comes in. Nevermind. Programmers must work for human –not machine– efficiency. As the German aircraft designer Willy Messerschmidt used to  say: <em>&ldquo;You can have any combination of features the Air Ministry desires, so long as you do not also require that the resulting airplane fly&rdquo;</em>. Nevermind. It makes me remind the hateful discussion with that guy of the iPhone –he would surely uppercase the &ldquo;i&rdquo;– and his ego.</p>
<p><em>The “n” isn’t, is it?</em>
No, it&rsquo;s not. BTW, time ago I posted <strong>[[http://typophile.com/node/54406|an uncommented log]]</strong> (not in the proper place) about some concerns you introduced in my mind on that matter. Still have a lot of unanswered questions.</p>

I don&rsquo;t really care if PostScript is swearing at Ernestine internally :-) – I was just wondering if I was setting myself (OK, the &ldquo;u&rdquo;) up for a lot of (printing) problems by going this route with that stem.</p>
<p>I remember reading your &ldquo;hmn&rdquo; post – left me impressed, and stumped. It&rsquo;s interesting to look at it again now and see some of those fonts actually have sligthly differing widths between the &ldquo;h&rdquo; and &ldquo;n&rdquo;… that&rsquo;s good to see.</p>

One easy way out is converting to curves (algorithms deal better with them):<img src="/images/old-images/Picture_6051.png" alt="">

This is interesting – thanks! I&rsquo;m still experimenting with the amount of undershoot the curvy descenders should get, and it&rsquo;s currently less than the overshoot zones at the x-line and the baseline (which I&rsquo;ve also been figuring out more exactly recently), so it&rsquo;s quite possible it&rsquo;s not enough.
The problem is, like you said too, both the length of the straight ones and that of the curved ones looks good to me when seen in isolation. :-|
Will play around a bit and try and make them line up better.</p>
<p>Also, interesting point about the &ldquo;h&rdquo;/&ldquo;n&rdquo; width &ldquo;illusion&rdquo;. I might just hold off on actually changing the &ldquo;h&rdquo; until the rest of the lowercase is born.</p>

That&rsquo;s what I was going to say.</p>
<p>c - does the top curl around too far before terminating?
j - is indeed cramped looking
e - I wasn&rsquo;t sure at first glance (too eager?) but I&rsquo;ve decided I really like it. The large counter works great with the flavor of the font that&rsquo;s emerging.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t really like the serif-lightening you&rsquo;re doing - foot serif of d and head serif of p in particular look wimpy to me now, at large sizes anyway. But that one inside line we were talking about before looks great to me now.</p>

<em>&ldquo;c - does the top curl around too far before terminating?&quot;</em>
I don&rsquo;t think I get this. :-(
Are you wondering about raising the ball / flattening the top curve?</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;foot serif of d and head serif of p in particular look wimpy to me now, at large sizes anyway.&quot;</em>
Oh, not good. I agree that cutting off that corner makes them lighter optically, which probably isn&rsquo;t a good thing. Though I&rsquo;m not sure they don&rsquo;t work okay in text. I should probably put a PDF together soon that has more text at intended text sizes… but that&rsquo;s still going to take a moment – it&rsquo;s pretty hard to think up anything resembling text with only 16 letters! ;-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking at the vertical relation of the top and bottom ends.
<img src="/images/old-images/c_5678.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The ball at top stretches over the bottom - it shares this with the &lsquo;e&rsquo; (it&rsquo;s what I meant by &ldquo;eager&rdquo; in that context) but IMO it doesn&rsquo;t work as well in the &lsquo;c&rsquo;. At first I was going to suggest rolling back the top end, but now I&rsquo;m thinking to retain the roundness of the whole, it might work better to extend the lower end out (and probably up). I think it can be more different from the bottom of the &lsquo;e&rsquo; (which, with its crossbar, is a different context) than it is, while still maintaining a genetic resemblance.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK. I got immersed in the &ldquo;s&rdquo;, and it has opened up a little can of worms. :-)
(The changes discussed earlier are still coming up; just got quite caught up in this.)</p>
<p>To recap, the &ldquo;s&rdquo; I originally intended has one ball terminal on top and no ball/serif on the bottom (like #2 below). I like the concept, but it kept looking pretty lopsided/contorted/unnatural. So just to open up the field again, I did some thinking about my options; this is what I came up with:
<img src="/images/old-images/s-nebeneinander_6524.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Options I&rsquo;m definitely unhappy with in grey.
Also, I know the curves still need some work; but I&rsquo;m hoping not to do the serious tweaking six times! So I hope these are worked out enough to tell if the respective concepts could work.</p>
<p>Some notes/comments –
<strong>1</strong>: Works, but probably looks too naked in the context of a slab serif font. Also makes me queasy when I think about the caps.
<strong>2</strong>: Still my favorite, but still a bit awkward; I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;s only a matter of execution. Would nicely match the &ldquo;c&rdquo; while not clashing with the &ldquo;a&rdquo;.
<strong>3</strong>: Seems like the obvious solution, but looks too cute and too cluttered/busy to me. Also makes the weak-topped &ldquo;a&rdquo; look like a mistake.
<strong>4</strong>: This struck me after looking at my old typewriter again – typewriter fonts tend to have ball terminals on things like the &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;c&rdquo;, &ldquo;j&rdquo;, &amp;c., but outwards-pointing serifs on the &ldquo;s&rdquo; (as well as on many caps). I&rsquo;m not at all happy with it, and don&rsquo;t think it works for Ernestine (see the &ldquo;q&rdquo;), but happy I tried it.
<strong>5</strong>: Tried to combine #2 and #4 in an effort to make #2 less top-heavy. Looks like a zombie up close, and is probably too distracting in text, but was interesting to try.
<strong>6</strong>: Variation on #4, moving the serifs inside the curves. I like this better than #4, and think it works okay, but doesn&rsquo;t click with too much in the font (except the &ldquo;z&rdquo;, which isn&rsquo;t there yet).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure. I think, I think, I&rsquo;d probably most like to continue on the #2 route; but I&rsquo;m wondering if you guys think it&rsquo;s actually possible to make it look truly good and balanced (I&rsquo;m finding it tough). Also, when I think ahead to the terminals on the caps, I&rsquo;d probably feel most at ease with #2 or maybe #3; though I&rsquo;m wondering about #6 as well, and any thoughts on the &ldquo;permissibleness&rdquo; of #1.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a PDF with all 6 variants tested in a short paragraph at 9pt:

Same here, Craig! I was pretty surprised.</p>
<p>Re #4 above, here&rsquo;s the acs treatment in</p>
<ul>
<li>my old typewriter (a 1958 <a href="http://mytypewriter.com/hermes3000of1958.aspx">Hermes 3000</a>),</li>
<li>Fine Line, a typewriter font from IBM,</li>
<li>Alphabet Centre Georges Pompidou (1976) by Frutiger, based on Fine Line.
<img src="/images/old-images/acs-examples_6403.gif" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<p>With the need to accommodate a serif on the outside, the curves definitely get a different character. I tried to bend them in as gently as I could, and I suspect you&rsquo;re right that I&rsquo;d have to do it more strongly to make the shape work; but closing up counters and making curves less flat/open is precisely one thing I&rsquo;m reluctant to do in Ernestine (which is also why I gave up on putting a spike on top of the &ldquo;q&rdquo;). It seems out of character somehow; and this treatment in particular makes a lot less practical sense to me than it seems to add noise. Though maybe I&rsquo;m not seeing something.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;ball on the bottom and nothing on top&rdquo;</em>
Hrant, good point. I did try that previously, but it seemed even more lopsided than the top-balled one, so it didn&rsquo;t make it into this round. Looking at it again, I probably ruled it out too quickly. (Please forgive bumpiness of curves.)
<img src="/images/old-images/s-new-bottomball_3728.gif" alt="">
I won&rsquo;t put balls on both ends unless there&rsquo;s good reason to believe I should. 
But this might really be a good alternative to the top-balled one. I especially enjoy how it relates to the &ldquo;c&rdquo;.</p>

Looks interesting, but maybe slightly too funky? I may have to play around with the proportions. I suspect that if the difference/asymmetry is too slight, it may be off-putting; and if I make the top even narrower than this, the whole thing seems to get too curly and round. Interesting idea though!</div>

Hmm, the doubts I have are that it:</p>
<ol>
<li>makes the lack of a ball terminal on the &ldquo;a&rdquo; (a decision I would like to consider as final) look strange, or like a mistake;</li>
<li>strangely looks too flat overall, like it doesn&rsquo;t have enough overshoot? (And I&rsquo;m not sure I want to use larger overshoot values just for this one glyph – but if I bend the curves in more to make it less &ldquo;flat&rdquo;, the terminals close up the counters a lot and make things even busier.)</li>
<li>looks primarily pretty and maybe a bit conceited, as opposed to serious and working; maybe also evoking too much of the usual Archer association. But maybe I&rsquo;m judging that too harshly… in the end, other glyphs are a bit &ldquo;special&rdquo; too.
I just don&rsquo;t want this to go too far down the &ldquo;decorative&rdquo; route.</li>

<p>So the lowercase is somewhat complete now. New PDF attached up top: <a href="	
http://typophile.com/files/ernestine_lc_v3.pdf">ernestine_lc_v3.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from a bunch of new glyphs (&ldquo;f&rdquo;, &ldquo;k&rdquo;, &ldquo;r&rdquo;, &ldquo;t&rdquo;, vwxyz, plus some diacritics and such), I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of tweaking: mostly things previously discussed here, such as figuring out the weights of rounds vs. straights, and the overshoots on the descenders. I think it looks more balanced now, although the spacing is still raw.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>There are some glyphs that I know are still somewhere between slightly problematic and totally not working.
&ldquo;s&rdquo; I think is most problematic in terms of being bumpy and probably top-heavy?
The single-balled one kept looking strange, so I exchanged it for the double-balled one. I still think this is slightly too cute and slightly too busy, but it looks more like an &ldquo;s&rdquo; somehow; it&rsquo;s a bit less distracting. But if anyone can advise me on its width, that&rsquo;d be greatly appreciated. I haven&rsquo;t really understood yet how the &ldquo;s&rdquo; is really narrow in some fonts and pretty wide in others, and most of all, how wide mine should be.
&ldquo;k&rdquo;: Not sure if it&rsquo;s too cute/strange, although I still like it.
&ldquo;i&rdquo;/&ldquo;j&rdquo;: Does the tittle need to be higher?
&ldquo;t&rdquo;: Does this work? Still not sure what matters in a &ldquo;t&rdquo;, but I do kinda like this one.
I&rsquo;ll be happy to hear your opinions and feed-back!</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>So after this, next up is: seriously working out spacing (which I expect will necessitate re-tweaking some of the glyphs), and setting up the caps. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to those, as well as the numerals.</p>

&ldquo;s&rdquo;: you&rsquo;ve got a good quiz here; besides of your concerns (and before progressing in any direction) I guess that you should consider to slant its spine a bit: to my eyes, it looks very horizontal and static.
&ldquo;k&rdquo;: it&rsquo;s a very attractive/appealing character that notably doesn&rsquo;t interfere when put in body text; certainly original, I&rsquo;d leave it as is.
&ldquo;i&rdquo;/&ldquo;j&rdquo;: tittles are in tune.
&ldquo;t&rdquo;: perhaps it needs to be taller and, maybe, a little wider; all in all, I like its shape, but I see it quite small.
Beyond the pretty long-studied &ldquo;g&rdquo; (well, our common matter ;-) &hellip;) I like the &ldquo;e&rdquo;, &ldquo;c&rdquo;, &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;r&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo; the most, probably in that order.
About the third page in the PDF, it immediatly reminds me the word harmony.
i&rsquo;d like to see your numerals&hellip; asap!</p>
<p><strong>MarS</strong></p>

<img src="/images/old-images/s-t-changes_3946.gif" alt="">
(red = old; green = new)</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to look at this for a bit. The changes in the &ldquo;s&rdquo; will need to be done a bit more carefully; but this is what you meant, yes? I am a bit worried this messes too much with the NW and SE &ldquo;corners&rdquo; – it makes them a bit &ldquo;pointy&rdquo;? Slanting the spine would certainly be easier if the glyph wasn&rsquo;t as wide.
Re the &ldquo;t&rdquo;, I think this works very well! Thanks. (I only made it a very little bit taller, as I don&rsquo;t want it to be too close to what I expect will be the cap height. But the new width I think is better, especially in the foot.)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;i’d like to see your numerals&hellip; asap!&quot;</em>
Yessir! :-D<br>
Actually, I&rsquo;ve started making caps. That&rsquo;s a lot of fun! The numerals still need to be thought out for a bit, though.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the new t too. I wonder if the foot could curve more symmetrically, with the extremum further to the right, or would that not work well? 
The first s works better for me, though I do think something about the spine looks fishy. I wonder if the second one can be improved by shifting the upper and lower extrema left and right respectively to make the &lsquo;pointy&rsquo; curves more round than flat?? Or go the other way completely and make the spine more horizontal and the whole thing a touch wider? Tough call.
I&rsquo;m looking forward to the caps and numerals too. The numerals always take me much longer to visualise.
Funny, I love the g e and a too. And m and n.</div>

<p>I think &lsquo;w&rsquo; is too wide. I might like to see the center vertex raised a little, too, but first I&rsquo;d try narrowing the letter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;x'&rsquo;s top and bottom counters look a little cramped. I wonder what it would look like if you kept the serifs where they are but started the diagonal strokes more on the outside of them (so you have less steep horizontals and larger top and bottom counters, while retaining the width of the glyph).</p>
<p>The acute accent on e (and probably on y) looks too far right to me. You may want to lighten your oslash, too.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;k&rsquo; is closer to working for me than it used to be, but its arm still looks rather too droopy to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;g'&rsquo;s ear pops out a little when followed by a letter with x-height head serifs (e.g. n or r), but I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s anything worth worrying about.</p>
<p>You convinced me on my critique thread that the umlaut- and i-dots need not align, but seeing &ldquo;böig&rdquo; here I wonder if they should be a little closer in height.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ooh, thanks for your words guys :)</p>
<p>After looking at this for another day, I think I agree that the old &ldquo;s&rdquo; works better. I don&rsquo;t really know where to go with the &ldquo;s&rdquo;; but I&rsquo;m thinking, one way or another, its spine has to firm up a bit, get more direction. It seems… wobbly.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;At any point did you try smaller ball terminals?&quot;</em>
Craig, I didn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s an interesting idea. I&rsquo;ve been a bit wary of introducing too many different sizes of balls (and serifs), but the &ldquo;s&rdquo; might really benefit from smaller ones. I&rsquo;ll try this.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tips on &ldquo;w&rdquo; and &ldquo;x&rdquo; (and the rest)! I&rsquo;m going to try out your suggestions. I fully agree the &ldquo;x&rdquo; looks cramped. I haven&rsquo;t yet been able to produce one that looked moderately happy. :-\</p>
<p>Re the &ldquo;k&rdquo;&rsquo;s arm seeming droopy, do you think bringing it closer to the architecture of the &ldquo;r&rdquo; might work? (In terms of &ldquo;more upward thrust&rdquo;)</p>
<p><em>&quot;’g”s ear pops out a little when followed by a letter with x-height head serifs&rdquo;</em>
:-) I noticed this too today and had to laugh. It&rsquo;s like the serifs tickle it under the ear or something. Then again, as long as there are ticklish ears like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/ourtype/parry_black_ot/&sample_text=g&sample_size=388">this</a> around (and yes I love Parry&rsquo;s &ldquo;g&rdquo;), I guess I needn&rsquo;t worry about that. ;-)</p>
<p>Re &ldquo;böig&rdquo;: Dunno, I must admit I really like my umlauts low like this. But I&rsquo;ll try raising them a hair and see what that does. It might still be a bit unbalanced.</p>
<p>Ben, with the &ldquo;t&rdquo;, you might be on to something:
<img src="/images/old-images/t-bendy_4295.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, I think the second one is more harmonious, but maybe also a bit more boring? Reminds me of the handle of an umbrella. ;-) But spontaneously, I like this a lot more than I thought I would. Although of course now I don&rsquo;t want to spoil Craig&rsquo;s new favorite glyph. :-)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I’m looking forward to the caps and numerals too.&quot;</em>
Somebody save me from myself. I made my first ever OT feature today (because I was running out of other keys to stick alternates on, so I figured I&rsquo;d just make a salt feature), and now all I&rsquo;m doing is playing around making funny cap ligatures. :-{
Anyway, I think I&rsquo;ll be able to post some caps soon! Cheers.</p>

<p>Looking at the &ldquo;A&rdquo; alone:
<img src="/images/old-images/alligator_4227.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>…the left hand one definitely looks better to me. I tried not to like it (I&rsquo;m not generally a fan of head serifs on &ldquo;A&quot;s), but it seems fitting. I think the other one looks too naked, and kind of bland too.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I add diacritics and stuff:
<img src="/images/old-images/adiacritics_4334.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>…now the head serif is completely too much, and in the way. Except in the &ldquo;AE&rdquo;, which seems to look stupid <em>without</em> the serif. :-\</p>
<p>Question: Do you guys think I could get away with putting a head serif on the basic &ldquo;A&rdquo;, but then dropping the serif as soon as diacritics join the fun? Or is that confusing / a bad idea?</p>
<p>If the &ldquo;serifage&rdquo; should be standardized: Would you agree that it&rsquo;s most important that the basic &ldquo;A&rdquo; looks good, even if it cramps the &ldquo;diacriticized&rdquo; &ldquo;A&quot;s a bit, rather than the other way round?</p>
<p>I could also of course just leave it as is, which is the head-serifed one as the standard, and a stylistic set for the head-serif-less &ldquo;A&rdquo; and friends. But I don&rsquo;t want to do that just because I&rsquo;m not able to <em>decide</em>. :-)
Opinions?</p>

I realize it&rsquo;s a bit extreme, but admit I lurve it (to paraphrase Woody Allen, I think). But maybe it&rsquo;s too much. Is it? I dunno. I wasn&rsquo;t actually gonna post the caps yet, since they&rsquo;re heavily under construction. But now I couldn&rsquo;t not post them. ;-)

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Cheers Ben. I didn&rsquo;t think of a smaller serif. I&rsquo;ll try that.</p>
<p>About the &ldquo;A&rdquo; serif: I guess I worry that when one sees an &ldquo;A&rdquo; (with serif) after a couple of say &ldquo;Ä&quot;s (lacking a serif), one might then spontaneously mistake the head serif for a diacritic of sorts, since one gets used to those little bits up there carrying meaning, but then the head serif doesn&rsquo;t. I certainly don&rsquo;t want to cause any confusion just because I think the serif looks good. I&rsquo;ll need to test that.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I think the height is pretty good, perhaps it could go up a fraction but I’d have to see a pdf to be sure.&quot;</em>
I&rsquo;ll post one soon-ish. I was thinking of maybe making them a <em>hair</em> higher too, but it seems like a good idea to steer clear of the ascender head serifs (say in &ldquo;Th&rdquo;).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, here&rsquo;s a pretty major update, including caps and 3 sets of numerals.
New PDF attached up top: <a href="http://typophile.com/files/ernestine_v3.pdf">Ernestine_v3.pdf</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ernestine-v3_6404.gif" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p>Caps: Still rather rough, so I&rsquo;m all ears for proportions and weights that are off, etc.
I think I&rsquo;ve pretty much settled for the short and wide overall proportions, I think it fits the font quite nicely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rdquo;: I&rsquo;ve decided for the head-serif-less one at least for now; it does seem to be more &ldquo;usable&rdquo; / less problematic.
&ldquo;L&rdquo;, &ldquo;T&rdquo;: Ben, I made the vertical serifs a hair longer. I think I did. But the ones on the &ldquo;T&rdquo; quickly run me into collision problems (tittles, x-height stuff).
&ldquo;M&rdquo;, &ldquo;N&rdquo; etc.: I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;m having to do a lot of optical corrections (trapping, thinning of strokes, &amp;c.) on some glyphs. Please let me know if this works for you; I don&rsquo;t quite trust my printer.</p>
<hr>
<p>Numerals: also still rough, irregularities in weights.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ernestine_tnum_3665.gif" alt="">
The lining figs are best for tabular use I think (I&rsquo;m not sure how much sense the proportional lining figs make, but they&rsquo;re there). I tried to give them a similar feel as the letters; that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re rather wide.
A couple of detail notes:
&ldquo;4&rdquo;: the convex curve is a direct Patria influence and seemed (a) helpful for making the &ldquo;4&rdquo; reach a good apparent width; and (b) looking good. 
&ldquo;7&rdquo;: I&rsquo;ve never understood why these aren&rsquo;t more commonly given a foot serif, at least in lining figures where they would seem to need something to stand on just like the &ldquo;1&rdquo; does. Rockwell &amp; Patria gave me the final push to try it. I like it a lot.
&ldquo;8&rdquo;: the &ldquo;S&rdquo; shape with the rather strong offset isn&rsquo;t just something I find sexy (which I admit I do, like in Museo [Sans] or Designal), but also helps the &ldquo;8&rdquo; reach this sort of width without looking like an obese snowman. :-&gt;</p>
<p>*
<img src="/images/old-images/ernestine_hnum_4044.gif" alt="">
Hybrids: the idea to make these was mainly inspired by my old typewriter, which has interesting &ldquo;cap-height-slightly-ranging figs&rdquo;; I like the concept, but full cap height <em>plus</em> little extenders was too massive in Ernestine. On the other hand, oldstyle figures seemed too &ldquo;classical&rdquo;. So these hybrids seem to be a great middle ground; and I really like them in other fonts (like Fontin). 
I&rsquo;d be very curious to hear what you think of them – both the concept and the execution. I ended up changing the shapes a lot from the lining versions, the idea being to have the parts that ascend and descend feel more like &ldquo;bits that are sticking up or hanging down&rdquo; (which explains the lack of serif on the &ldquo;7&rdquo;, since it&rsquo;s not standing anymore but hanging; I tried a half serif, like the sexy one in Fairplex, but that didn&rsquo;t work). I&rsquo;m not sure if that was too much, and I wonder if the 3, 5, 6, and 9 in particular still fit the font. For some reason, they remind me a bit of Thesis now (which I haven&rsquo;t been looking at), and I wonder if I can&rsquo;t have more serifs/balls in there.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some minor tweaks done to the lc too. Craig, thanks for pointing me to the arm of the &ldquo;k&rdquo;! I&rsquo;ve made it less droopy, and it seems much better. I also made the &ldquo;w&rdquo; narrower, and I think I&rsquo;m getting close to figuring out the &ldquo;s&rdquo; (which does involve slightly smaller ball terminals, and a more symmetrical curve).
Don&rsquo;t look at the germandbls – that one&rsquo;s still under heavy construction.
Oh, and spacing is <em>still</em> rough. :-\</p>
<hr>
<p>BTW, Ernestine is nearing its first public use on a <a href="http://typophile.com/node/57136">book cover</a>. It&rsquo;s pretty scary!</p>
<p>Anyway: As always, I&rsquo;d be most happy for feed-back. I&rsquo;m looking forward to pushing this further.</p>

Some notes from my once-over:</p>
<ul>
<li>ft combination (in &ldquo;Fifty&rdquo;) is just utterly lovely!</li>
<li>exclamation point is nice</li>
<li>center vertex of M is too fragile.</li>
<li>placement of Q&rsquo;s tail seems somewhat arbitrary, &ldquo;tacked-on.&rdquo; Would starting it more vertically as it comes off the bowl mesh with the &ldquo;perpendicularity&rdquo; of the slab serifs better? (Or would that sap it of energy?)</li>
<li>I know there are encroaching neighbors to consider but could you give yet another hair to the vertical serifs of E/F/T/L/Z? (perhaps 2/3/7 too)</li>
<li>too much contrast in arms of Y, and maybe X too. Or are my eyes playing tricks on me?</li>
<li>inconsistent stroke widths: (cap) Z&rsquo;s diagonal seems slimmer while (lc) z&rsquo;s diagonal is thicker</li>
<li>maybe enlarge the counter of the ring diacritic</li>
<li>strengthen the middle arm-and-serif (the one at the right, at e-crossbar height) of the ampersand</li>
<li>the overhang of proportional one&rsquo;s flag over the bottom serif looks goofy to me in the big specimen, but in the text context not so much.</li>
<li>did you try some kind of taper on the base stroke of tabular one?</li>
<li>I might lower the middle vertex of all the threes</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d try a serif (maybe an upward slab) at the top terminal of your fives</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m totally on-board with your foot-seriffed sevens</li>
<li>wide, offset form of eight looks good - maybe make the bottom bowl a touch rounder (less squarish)</li>
<li>I agree that you should consider your k fixed! :-)</li>

		<div class="commentbody">This is VERY exciting to see! :)
It&rsquo;s looking wonderful and neat already.
I&rsquo;m going to be picky!
The caps are really nice. I think I mentioned before the ERY being my favourites. I think G could have a longer crossbar. J is pleasant. The curly arm of K looks slightly weak somehow, like it&rsquo;s not quite sure it should be curling like that. I think it needs more weight on the NW corner of the terminal?
On M, I think the centre vertex should have a narrower bevel, bringing the bottom of the join down a few units. N seems maybe wide a little. 
I agree with Craig about Q. Is the tail past 6 o&rsquo;clock? I actually think a tail like on Lubalin Graph might work well. 
S works well. The arms of T look like the serifs need more, but appreciate they might start interfering with other letters. On X the offset looks a bit too great. 
LF: I like the goofy 1! The 2 and 3 work nicely. 4 I&rsquo;m not sure. The crossbar looks maybe a bit high. Try a serif on the top of 5. Did you try ball terminals on 6 and 9? They&rsquo;re nice shapes but maybe balls would fit well too. I like 7 and 8. The foot serif on 7 works nicely. 0 looks eggy. I&rsquo;m wondering if your brackets are too roundy&hellip;but would have to see in context to be sure. The diacritics look good to me.
I really like the OSF, they work especially nicely in text. The stem of 7 looks maybe a bit heavy. It could taper slightly towards the top. Otherwise I can&rsquo;t fault them! 
ACtually I haven&rsquo;t been able to print today so these comments are based on the large sizes on screen, so perhaps they aren&rsquo;t so relevant for small text sizes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow, thanks for the detailed comments guys!</p>
<p>Since you both mentioned the &ldquo;Q&rdquo;, here are some previous variants, which I found less fitting than the one that&rsquo;s in there now:
<img src="/images/old-images/Qs_3932.gif" alt="">
#1 is too strict and uninspired, #2 is trying too hard and is too much like Lubalin Graph (sorry, I really don&rsquo;t like its &ldquo;Q&rdquo;), #3 is a bit too soft/lyrical, #4 is definitely too much, #5 is too oldstyle, and #6 looks like one of those hooks on suction cups that you can hang kitchen towels on. But, #6 (combined with some of Dwiggins&rsquo;s &ldquo;Q&quot;s) was the basis for the current one, and I do like the current concept a lot. 
I will fiddle with the join of its tail, though – thanks for pointing that out.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Craig:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;did you try some kind of taper on the base stroke of tabular one?&quot;</cite>
I did try to make it sort of an extended serif. It looked positively weird (since it got so long that the angle got really close to horizontal so it looked like a mistake); though the taperless bar does too. Hm.</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;I’d try a serif (maybe an upward slab) at the top terminal of your fives&rdquo;</cite>
An upward serif! Wicked idea. I&rsquo;ll so try this.</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;ft combination (in “Fifty”) is just utterly lovely!&quot;</cite>
Thanks! It&rsquo;s my favorite glyph combination so far. I&rsquo;ve tried ligating it (see <a href="http://typophile.com/node/57136">here</a>), but I&rsquo;m not sure that makes it better.</p>
<p>Ben:</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;I think G could have a longer crossbar&rdquo;</cite>
That might just be what&rsquo;s wrong with the thing. I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on why it&rsquo;s looking so strange.</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;Did you try ball terminals on 6 and 9?&quot;</cite>
Hm, no, I was worried they&rsquo;d get too congested. But I&rsquo;ll see if it might work.</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;0 [zero] looks eggy.&quot;</cite>
That&rsquo;s intended. Does it look stupid?
Weird story: I got that idea from the Swiss licence number plates. I&rsquo;ve always liked that zero (example from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Swiss_registration_3179.jpg">Wikipedia</a>):
<img src="/images/old-images/kontrollschild_6299.jpg" alt="">
On a practical level, I like the egg shape for extra disambiguation besides the differing proportions of the zero(es). Somehow those eggs just <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be &ldquo;oh&quot;s – or is that just me?
<img src="/images/old-images/os-and-zeroes_6028.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Thanks again, this is very helpful. I&rsquo;ll be feeding the to-do list and let little E rest for a few days.</p>

Because I like the current form, and am not sure yet I see a cogent reason to head back down into the bewildering depths of &ldquo;Q&rdquo; land. But if there is one, I will.</p>
<p>Craig, #5 isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;bad&rdquo; formally; it just seems so dramatically oldstyle in the context of Ernestine&rsquo;s wide, slabby &ldquo;simpleness&rdquo; that I found it almost comical. Almost as wrong as the rather disturbing mental image of… Ernestine Swash. :-\</p>

<p>&ldquo;J&rdquo;: I&rsquo;ll have another look at the head serif. But I&rsquo;m surprised nobody has complained about the curve (what is that thing called, the left/curvy part of &ldquo;J&rdquo;?). I&rsquo;m not sure I like it at all. Hmm. Maybe it could be more tense/energetic?</p>

<p>Yes, Ben&rsquo;s descriptions fit my feeling about the Q, too. Did (or would) you consider having the tail loop around from the right stroke, something like this?

Might allow for a ball terminal, be a fresher solution, fit in with your signature &lsquo;g&rsquo;&hellip;

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To semi-wrap up this looong thread, my type design class formally ends this weekend, and I&rsquo;ll be presenting the state of my design. I had a little specimen booklet printed*, which really is quite the feeling (and I&rsquo;m trying, at the moment, not to focus too much on seeing the mistakes…)</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a couple of pix on Flickr: 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/3595003139/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/3595003139/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The booklet of course includes a big thankyou to you guys. Typophile has been a major driving force behind this.
<img src="/images/old-images/danke_4730.jpg" alt="">
Of course this won&rsquo;t be the last you see of &ldquo;my Mrs. E&rdquo; here. I might now however take a few weeks off from working on it.
The specimen PDF is not going online at the moment; but I do have a few booklets left that I can mail out, so if you think you should / want to have one, drop me a line. :)</p>

<p><cite>&ldquo;Does this mean you’ll be working on another font&rdquo;</cite>
Nah, there is no other font. The thing is, I&rsquo;ve got tons of other work piled up, and I&rsquo;m leaving for a vacation in a month, so I&rsquo;m not sure how much time I can put into this font until then. Plus my eyes, I think, could use a little break.
Although &ldquo;taking a break from type design completely&rdquo; does sound very, very sad… I&rsquo;ll probably do little things; just not work on it intensely for the next weeks.</p>
<p>Overall though I&rsquo;m all set, and have my plan laid out for the next few months. 
I&rsquo;m looking forward to doing some sketching of other weights, and the italics :-)
It&rsquo;s going to be exciting. But I need more time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Nina. Ok, so I finally got around to giving some crit on the specimen booklet you sent (thank you again!) and here are my opinions. I think I&rsquo;ve said some of these things previously and you may have investigated my suggestions before, I don&rsquo;t know. Remember the salt!</p>
<p>At large sizes, G looks like the crossbar should be wider, extending more into the counterspace. The bowl of J looks like something pulled its SW curve outwards a little. I wonder whether the vertical serifs on L and T should be longer; I think usually these are more pronounced than horizontal serifs. Q&hellip;you know what I&rsquo;d do with its tail. I think this is the glyph most needing work. I love R (and BDP)&hellip;somehow I find these shapes really hard to draw and yours have a nice poise and tautness. V&hellip;the contrast works really well, it&rsquo;s almost unnoticeable. Y as well. Did you try a higher midpoint on the W? Z: longer serifs? Looks like the lc z has larger serifs than the uc.</p>
<p>Lowercase. These are really beautiful. I really admire them. I like the way there&rsquo;s the balance between quite rigid shapes (a, d, h, x) and unique elements (g, k, s, y). I like the way the a and c have slight tapering towards the terminals&hellip;the curves are nicely placed so as to be not too curly and cute but not too sharp and straight. I&rsquo;d like to see similar inflection on the hood of the f, which perhaps looks a bit too curved before the ball terminal. I wonder if that might also resolve the s in a more satisfying way, I know you weren&rsquo;t quite happy with the s. I think the descender of j could need a tweak. Now, with k, I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s something distracting at small sizes where the eye notices there&rsquo;s something going on but can&rsquo;t quite tell when reading. I&rsquo;d make the bar shorter so as to not be noticeable so much when small but can be a feature at large sizes, perhaps. The join might also benefit from being lower down the stem. The letters I haven&rsquo;t mentioned I think are actually very good, lovely.</p>
<p>Numerals. 7 usually has a heavy top stroke and less weight on the diagonal, doesn&rsquo;t it? Or a thinner part near the top widening out to the baseline. I think there may be slightly too much weight on your downstroke, only a hair. And I&rsquo;d make the hanging-down serif longer. I find 4 a bit pinched at the apex. It looks like it starts with a lovely curve at the crossbar then turns a bit flatter as it approaches the apex and the overall shape (counter) is a bit narrow looking. Maybe this is just my taste. Should lf 3 have a lower midpoint? The egg-shaped zero puzzles me.</p>
<p>I originally thought 10pt was the best, now I&rsquo;m seeing it works very well at 8pt too, perhaps best. The general colour, spacing and proportions all look marvellous. The remarks above don&rsquo;t apply so much, though I&rsquo;d still make the vertical serifs longer. It looks good in all caps. I like the fi lig, the fl one sticks out a bit slightly perhaps (is that a contextual alternate or a discretionary lig?)</p>
<p>Diacritics&hellip;I&rsquo;m no expert at all at all but tilde looks a little shy and flat. I like the idea of the Polish acute as a language alternate&hellip;how do you write the feature code to do that?</p>
<p>@ is very nice. I like the cover!</p>
<p>Dagger might be too detailed/too small. Is there a double dagger? Quotation marks seem to be right handed or straight but no left handed? Curly brackets&hellip;maybe curve more round at the top&hellip;seems there&rsquo;s not enough &lsquo;backbone&rsquo; compared with the tautness of the alphabetic glyphs&hellip;get a shape that harmonises with a perhaps.</p>
<p>£ could have a wider hood, looks a bit mean and overbitey. # and Yen are very nice.</p>
<p>Spacing. a needs a notch less on the left. r_t lig is a bit tight. lbar_y looks great. There&rsquo;s something very odd with ak and nk. rn might be a bit close, see in &lsquo;Ernestine&rsquo;. Other than that, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m space-blind, so I won&rsquo;t comment. It&rsquo;s a hard, hard thing, good luck!</p>
<p>Hope this has been useful&hellip;as you always say, it&rsquo;s good not just for the person who drew the type but for others who are learning how to look for things and how they work. Thanks! :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow, thank you! You know you didn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to do this – but I greatly appreciate it. I hope I&rsquo;ll have time soon to continue working on this. Then I can get back in more detail.</p>
<p>Just these 2 things for now:</p>
<p>The &ldquo;l&rdquo; in &ldquo;fl&rdquo; is a contextual alternate at the moment (like in &ldquo;fb&rdquo;, &ldquo;fh&rdquo;, and &ldquo;fk&rdquo;). This is mostly for German where these can&rsquo;t always be physically ligated (there are grammatical rules). That said, I may well make an additional &ldquo;fl&rdquo; lig that&rsquo;s similar to the &ldquo;fi&rdquo; in concept.</p>
<p><cite>[Q] &ldquo;I think this is the glyph most needing work.&quot;</cite>
Really? I dislike my &ldquo;j&rdquo; much more (and am considering some rather unorthodox measures to make it work). 
Actually, I still like my &ldquo;Q&rdquo;. Hm. This might be a case of having to put it away for a couple more weeks &amp; then maybe I&rsquo;ll be able to see what might be wrong with it…</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Aah, I get the fl better now. Does German also use ligated fl, and how would the font know when to use the calt or the liga?</p>
<p>An unorthodox j? Sounds delicious!</p>
<p>It might be an idea to ask others about the Q. To me it looks coy and slightly bashful, like (do you remember?) the black f I originally drew in Eternal. When I showed the Ernestine booklet to my housemate (who doesn&rsquo;t know very much about type), he thought the Q stuck out as different. I think a ball terminal is the way to go, but there may be better solutions. These things are so subjective. I&rsquo;d definitely put it away for a couple of weeks and come back to it with fresh eyes anyway&hellip;have a nice break from type design!</p>
<p>I wanted to crit, it&rsquo;s a good process of learning to see and learning to articulate and in fact learning to draw too, so you&rsquo;re more than welcome! :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Many, many thanks to all those (here and elsewhere) who have lent their sharp eye and alerted me to things to look at! I&rsquo;d [finally] like to address a few points here (Ben, sorry for doing that soo late!).</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s often criticized is the shortness of vertical serifs in the caps. There&rsquo;s a reason for that: My caps are very short; and if I make the vertical serifs any longer, subsequent lowercase letters will start crashing into things like the &ldquo;T&rdquo;. Kerning things under those serifs is already pushing it now; so I&rsquo;m reluctant to make them longer, although I&rsquo;m wondering if this might be another nice application of contextual alternates.</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;At large sizes, G looks like the crossbar should be wider&rdquo;</cite>
How about at small sizes?* I&rsquo;m not sure about that thing – when I make the crossbar longer it looks stupid too. I&rsquo;m beginning to think it&rsquo;s good the way it is.
(* Ben, you can check that in the specimen, on the page that has the large lowercase alphabet, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;G&rdquo; in the bottom right.)</p>
<p>My numerals deliberately follow a &ldquo;romanized&rdquo; contrast scheme, hence the foot serif on the &ldquo;7&rdquo; – and the heavy downstroke. But, I did thin its top join a little.</p>
<p>*</p>
<h2 id="do-you-think-these-are-headed-in-a-better-direction-i-know-theyre-not-done--but-im-not-sure-what-to-do-with-them">I officially suck at making tildes, commas, and curly braces. The tilde I&rsquo;m still procrastinating on, and the comma&rsquo;s being worked, but here&rsquo;s a new attempt at braces:
<img src="/images/old-images/curly_5587.png" alt="">
Do you think these are headed in a better direction? (I know they&rsquo;re not done – but I&rsquo;m not sure what to do with them.)</h2>
<h2 id="btw-tweaked-the-curve-of-the-4-which-is-becoming-one-of-my-favorite-glyphs--is-also-slightly-more-polished">Oh, and how&rsquo;s this Pound? Still too narrow?
<img src="/images/old-images/four-at-pound_6612.png" alt="">
(BTW tweaked the curve of the &ldquo;4&rdquo;, which is becoming one of my favorite glyphs; &ldquo;@&rdquo; is also slightly more polished)</h2>
<h2 id="thinking-about-a-q-with-a-tail-in-the-vein-of-the-j-and-g-but-thats-still-being-incubated">And here&rsquo;s a first go at my new &ldquo;unorthodox&rdquo; &ldquo;j&rdquo; (obviously not polished yet):
<img src="/images/old-images/jungle_6594.png" alt="">
Thinking about a &ldquo;Q&rdquo; with a tail in the vein of the &ldquo;j&rdquo; and &ldquo;g&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s still being incubated.</h2>
<h2 id="imagesold-imagesfussball_4425png">What do people think about an eszett like this? It has been my secret favorite and an alternate, but now it&rsquo;s been voted up by a bunch of people whose opinions I value. I like the shape, but is it too quaint?
<img src="/images/old-images/fussball_4425.png" alt=""></h2>
<p>Ben, for the localized forms (in case that question still stands):
<img src="/images/old-images/locl_6578.png" alt="">
And then you need to list all the referenced languages in the bottom part of the window (see here: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/58617">http://typophile.com/node/58617</a> )</p>

<p>Ok let me dig out the specimen!</p>
<p>That G, yes, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s true at small sizes too. I checked the other 10pt Gs in the specimen too — not sure why I specified large sizes!</p>
<p>Regarding vertical serifs on the caps, it should only be F and T that could crash into lc glyphs, no? Fe and Tr look like they still has room for a longer serif (though I don&rsquo;t think you had kerning in the specimen I haveI didn&rsquo;t find any others that looked in danger of crashing. Did you space the caps with caps or lc?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I officially suck at making tildes, commas, and curly braces. 
These are <em>really</em> hard for me too. Maybe try giving the nose-point a bevel and open up the inner sides; you don&rsquo;t have sharp points on other glyphs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>£ is a good shape. I&rsquo;d bring the crossbar down to make the top and bottom counters more equal. (It won&rsquo;t match the E crossbar.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look forward to seeing your new j up close in a pdf.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking about a “Q” with a tail in the vein of the “j” and “g”. 
You mean like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-bookman/|Bookman]]? What&rsquo;s your current feeling on the original Q? (I mean don&rsquo;t just change it on my account!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really comment on eszett for readability, but I like the shape.</p>
<p>Thanks for the link; I still don&rsquo;t quite get it, but will make an effort to get to grips with it when I start coding features into my fonts (so far just have the very simple ones like liga, dlig and calt). Har.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Craig, I don&rsquo;t really want to put that full specimen online, especially now that it&rsquo;s out of date. But I&rsquo;ll gladly mail you one if you give me a ground address to use. And I&rsquo;ll likely post a new, updated PDF soon. But some things (like that &ldquo;j&rdquo;) are just too early to seriously put up for crits.
(Oh, there&rsquo;s also going to be a new print specimen, as the Very Final Extra-Late Additional Presentation for my type design class will be on in three weeks. If you want one let me know. I&rsquo;ll probably get a few extra printed.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll look at that &ldquo;G&rdquo; again Ben. You think &ldquo;Tr&rdquo; still has room? I had to kern &ldquo;Tu&rdquo; recently and that was No Fun. But maybe I&rsquo;m being too cautious with my baby font. BTW that specimen doesn&rsquo;t have any kerning at all, as far as I remember, or maybe only &ldquo;Ve&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vo&rdquo; and a couple of obvious things like that.</p>
<p>The curly braces have bevels, but I guess they&rsquo;re still too sharp. 
Thanks for the pointer on the pound sign!</p>
<p><cite>&ldquo;What’s your current feeling on the original Q? (I mean don’t just change it on my account!)&quot;</cite>
You weren&rsquo;t the only one; it&rsquo;s now a small crowd that doesn&rsquo;t seem very convinced about the &ldquo;Q&rdquo;. I can see where the criticism comes from, although frankly now I&rsquo;m just not sure what I think.
Bookman? That looks a bit like what I have now. But yeah, like the tail of the &ldquo;g&rdquo; mirrored perhaps? A bit curvier than now, and possibly with a ball. I&rsquo;ll need to play around with it, it was just a thought really, not much node-pushing done yet.</p>

<a href="https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/ernestine">https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/ernestine</a></p>
<p>Some surprises in there for those who don&rsquo;t know yet. The glyph set has grown a lot, including an Armenian companion that Hrant has drawn. There&rsquo;s an Italic, a ton of other stuff, go have a look :-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a micro site with some showings and background info:
