  is a genuine typeface or just custom type for the logo? It doesn't seem like it
  was ever actually used by Alexander McQueen. Unfortunately, I can't find any information
  about it online."

    (the A, R, and Q being the most obvious). They adjusted it a great deal, if that
    typeface was the basis. \r\n\r\nI can't find anything closer... "

    for checking and my apologies for the over-statement. [[http://www.face37.com/projects/f37-bella-stencil|Bella
    Stencil]] F37 might work pretty well too. /R and /Q come definitely closer, switching
    default /C for alternate and adding (virtually) closing triangles to /A, /M and
    /N should get you pretty close, possibly even closer than DoublePlusGood. '
