  is a Roman face made fun, with a healthy dose of filigree curves thrown into the
  mix. It's an ideal compliment to our extensive Bertoni family, but can be used anywhere
  a bit of humour and flair is required.  \r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/tulks-victorian-banner/
  | Tulk's Victorian Banner]] revives the tradion of 'Banner' typefaces-lettering
  within their own lozenge or cartouche, that nmade such an appealing feature in many
  old type foundries catalogues.  Tulk's Victorian Banner makes a wonderful feature
  of lettering in any piece of period inspired design.  It compleiments our recent
  Fitzgerald space especially well, but can be used alongside any typeface of your
  choice where you want to bring a touch of period flamboyance.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Document5_6604.png]"
