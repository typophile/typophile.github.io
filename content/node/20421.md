  body: "I'm pretty certain that it's Helvetica Extra Compressed. You have to take
    into account the how the poor quality of the sample, probably caused by low-res
    printing or scanning, would affect the letterforms (see M). \r\n\r\nBut I've been
    wrong  before. :^)"

    perfectly with no extra track/kern using Extra Compressed.\r\n\r\nThanks again.

  body: "hehehe. I remember when I had to reproduce HEAPS of logos ... I'd snigger
    if the type was set without custom tracking/kerning.\r\n\r\nbut then, the first
    logo that wasn set thoughtfully taught me about some of the basic terms of typography,
    so it was a good gig.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yep, I have to do it all the time too, and i agree, it can be a useful exercise.
    \ I've learnt more about drawing with bezier from redrawing logos than anything
    else.  \r\n\r\nIt's painful when the job doesnt arrive until 2 hours before material
    delivery deadline from a client who cant understand why we cant print a gravelly
    low res scan of a 4th generation copy!\r\n\r\nBut thats prepress services for
    ya...  "

    redraw it rather than make 10 phone calls to different people who have no idea
    what your talking about and wont pass you on any higher, because they're too embarassed
    that people might find out they dont know what they are doing!\r\n\r\nWhat is
    even better is when they read the prefab instructions on image formats, then convert
    their 72dpi .gif to .eps and wonder why it still isn't good enough!\r\n\r\n"
