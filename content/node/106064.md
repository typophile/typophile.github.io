  I am working in an agriculture/farming project I am not an expert in typography
  but I understand it\u2019s value.  My standard typefaces are FFMeta+FFMetaSerif,
  not very original but I like them\u2026 :-)\r\n\r\nTo increase my practice on typography
  and see new things I am considering to use a specific font set for this project.
  After examining \"The Anatomy of Type\" book I have as candidates Cronos+FFClifford,
  looking at the specimens on the websites the combination to my inexperienced eye
  looks good. To have an idea I also looked at the reports of one big Big BIG US company
  on this topic and they use Sabon+CorporateS, Sabon plus my already bought FFMeta
  also looks good to me but for a reason I can not see agriculture on those.\r\n\r\nI
  would appreciate any idea/recommendation; the idea around the topic in my report
  is innovation in agriculture and organic farming.\r\n\r\nThank you and regards,\r\n\r\nCarlos."

    kind of typography signi\uFB01es \u201Corganic\u201D and \u201Cinnovation\u201D
    within that sector?\r\n\r\nOr see what Monsanto\u2019s graphics are like and do
    the opposite."

  body: "Thank you for your answer. Regarding Monsanto they are the ones with Sabon+CorporateS
    ;-).\r\nI have made a bit of research and the only relevant source that I have
    found with in my humble opinion interesting typography is using Precious Sans,
    but it seems that they are still developing OpenType and while I really like their
    \"g\" and \"s\" glyphs there are not old style figures and I really like to use
    that feature."

    and health food products. Maybe make a trip to Whole Foods or a local health food
    store. \r\n\r\nAlthough from your description of \"innovation in agriculture and
    organic farming\", I'm not sure if you're just focusing on organic, or on farming
    innovation in general. Less than 5% of total food sales in the U.S. are organic,
    so a lot of \"innovation\" in farming is probably in other areas, such as improved
    farming technology."
