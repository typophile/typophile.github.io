body: The image is from the cover of Polish Playboy magazine 4/2012. By searching
  the web, the earliest issues showing this typeface I could find were from 2005,
  thus, the typeface must have been designed in 2005 or earlier.  It looks so familiar,
  maybe because it's similar to Farnham?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Playboy_5558.png]

  body: No, it's a different typeface.  Compare for example the bottom serifs (rectangular
    in Farnham, triangular in this typeface) and the beaks on F and T (angular in
    Farnham, slightly rounded in this typeface).

  body: You're right, I was too hasty to conclude, it's definitely not Farnham. So,
    how about [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/mercury-display/overview|Mercury Display]]?
