  example Mozilla Firefox and IE allows for fonts to be easily used\r\non Blogs and
  Websites.  This is the Web Open Font Format or WOFF see\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format\r\n\r\nBBT
  font introduced in 2008 for altering the k/K letter shapes for\r\nspirituality has
  been updated for this new standard.  Now you can use\r\nit on Blogs with easy code
  snippet called @font-face and some changes\r\nto the Blog CSS stylesheet.\r\n\r\nThis
  is a blog using the BBT font as an example:  http://BBTfont.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nPhoto

    flashes of unformatted text! I could see the "K" shape for about 10 seconds on
    my old computer, and I'm already feeling a bit suicidal :D

  body: "@sebastian_k\r\n\r\nI am pleased with the WOFF @font-face result compared
    with no font use at blogs and websites.  I am not a techie thus if you feel it
    can be improved please contact me via this board's contact feature.\r\n\r\nPlease
    correct me if I am wrong:  http://github.com/typekit/webfontloader seems to be
    tied to Google API w/ affiliates: Google Font Directory and Typekit (at this time)
    and thus not open for every font.  \r\n\r\nGoogle Font Directory has a monopolistic
    class tendency, not answering or mentioning their quality control issues and wanting
    to tyrant over spiritual font (race/religious (r/r) discrimination).  "

  body: "@paul.irish\r\n\r\nSomeone else said the same.  \r\n\r\nThey also said this
    about webfontloader, \"my understanding is: it can work with any font whether
    it's hosted by Google, hosted by Typekit, or hosted yourself. In my experience
    - there are very few cases where the benefits of the webfontloader can be seen.
    These are primarily with larger fonts that haven't been cached or subset for a
    specific website or in an application where significant aspects of the typography
    can be changed base on an end-user font selection.\"  \r\n\r\nThe other thing
    is that there is little information available about webfontloader: download/install,
    correct me if I am wrong.  \r\n\r\nYour site also says this 'caveat': \"If JavaScript
    is disabled, the text will remain visible the whole time\" and \"Mozilla is looking
    to rectify this soon.\"\r\n\r\nThus are you saying if WOFF font is there and JavaScript
    is not accepted on the browser options, the font will not be seen and even if
    webfontloader is installed it could have to be uninstalled soon as browsers (Mozilla
    Firefox)  that have the slight delay in displaying are going to be correcting
    the problem?  \r\n\r\n"
