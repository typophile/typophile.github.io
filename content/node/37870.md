body: "hopefully I'm asking this question in the right place. I also hope that I'm
  using the correct terms.\r\n\r\nHow would I go about doing this?:\r\n\r\nI'm Working
  on a poster and the background is white and in the middle theres a shape. The shape
  is purple (or any other color). Let's say i have text that is the same color as
  the shape. So the text goes through the shape. The text inside shape in the middle
  disappears because its the same color. Lets say I want it to be white the same color
  as the background. How can i change the color without doing it manually? is it a
  blending technique i have to use? what would be the best way to achieve that since
  it does involve a lot of text and some letters are caught between two colors.\r\n\r\nthank
  you."

  body: "The problem with using a blending mode is that to change the color of the
    background to white the text would need to be white, or close to it, to begin
    with.\r\n\r\nYou could try drawing a path to match the edges of your shape, converting
    the text to an outline, copying the text on top of itself, and using the pathfinder
    to intersect the shape and the text...but then you will have letters that change
    color around the edges of the shape. You might also end up needing Illustrator
    to pull that off.\r\n\r\nI really think that your best option is just to do this
    manually. When I run into stuff like this I just remind myself how long it would
    have taken to do back in the days on paste-ups."

  body: I'd outline the shape with the pen tool, convert the text to outlines, and
    make a copy of the "text" (which is now a vector graphic). Paste the text copy
    on top of the original text and use the align tools to make sure they are matched
    up exactly. Change the color of the text copy to the color you want to be inside
    the shape. Edit>Cut the copy and Edit>Paste into the outline of the shape that
    you made with the pen tool. If this is confusing see clipping paths under In-Design
    help. Depending on the complexity of the shape and the resolution of the image
    this should be a pretty successful solution. If this is going to be sent to a
    printer do NOT use blending techniques. They'll screw ya every time. Plus, if
    you're just getting started you need to know how to use clipping paths and masks
    because you'll be using them a lot. Good luck.

  body: sweeet. thx a lot that make a lot of sense. thank you, i will be printing
    this in my class room. will printers screw up blending techniques even if it was
    turned in as a PDF file?

  body: "Well... probably not, but don't use blending techniques unless you have to.
    You're relying on screen color to determine your finished product (unless you
    take it into photoshop and blend it and determine the actual CMYK results of your
    blending) and it's not the way a professional would handle the situaltion (most
    likely). My students would definitely earn brownie points for using a clipping
    path, and I'd probably launch into a long-winded lecture about not using transparency
    and blending unless absolutely necessary. But I don't think your grade would suffer
    (as long as it's visually appealing). And be sure to print it on your home printer
    because some colors may look vastly different on your screen than they do printed
    out, and even though your home printer may not give you exactly the same results
    that your classroom printer will, it should still give you a serious heads-up
    if you've landed on a color that doesn't translate well. I'm not sure what your
    InDesign color profile is, how close it is to your actual printer and screen settings
    or how well your screen is calibrated, but suffice to say there's a reasonably
    good chance that what you're seeing on your screen is not even close to what you'll
    get from your classroom's digital printer. \r\n\r\nBTW, if you created the original
    shape in Photoshop and you have a mask of the outline already stored in the Photoshop
    file, or if the shape is high resolution with a very distinct outline that could
    be easily selected in Photoshop and converted to a mask, then you can choose to
    import the file into InDesign with the mask designated as a clipping path and
    use that instead of tracing it with the pen tool. That info can be found in InDesign
    help under \"bitmap import options.\" I'd be a wee bit leery of the \"detect edges\"
    method of creating a clipping path, but that's a quick and easy method and may
    be worth a shot."
