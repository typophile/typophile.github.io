body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Typefaces]] : Kabel</strong>\r\n\r\nBegun by [[Rudolf
  Koch]] in 1927 for the [[Klingspor]] foundry. The typeface family was expanded and
  changed over the decades by [[D. Stempel AG]] and [[Linotype]].\r\n\r\nKabel is
  a geometric sans serif, similar to [[Futura]], [[Erbar]], and [[Nobel]]. It is best
  characterized by its angular stroke endings, its Venetian e, and its distinctive
  g (similar to the lowercase g used in many Koch designs, including [[Koch Antiqua]]
  and [[Wallau]]).\r\n\r\n[[Walter Tracy]] wrote about Kabel in the Rudolf Koch chapter
  of his [[Letters of Credit]]. The Beatles used Kabel in for the film titling in
  their 1960s animated classic, <em>Yellow Submarine</em>.\r\n\r\n[[Victor Caruso]]
  designed a version of Kabel for [[ITC]] in the 1970s, named [[ITC Kabel]], which
  is not faithful to the original design. Similar to [[ITC Garamond]], ITC Kabel has
  an excessively large x-height, created to please New York advertising tastes of
  the day.\r\n\r\nAn <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/892/kabel-family.html\">overview
  of the Kabel type family</a> is available on the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com\">Linotype
  website</a>."
