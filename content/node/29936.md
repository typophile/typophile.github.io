  impression I have is that Font rendering in Linux is like video driverds and printer
  drivers - a matter of which bit of thing you have installed. Meaning it might be
  almost as good as windows anti-aliasing & b&w in some cases but in general it's
  utterly unpredictable and on top of that it's a nearly non-existent market too.
  Is that right? Wrong? What do you think? Why? What about Solaris? Another non-market
  for indie font makers - right? \r\n\r\nAnd as a side issue. What Windows OS ( via
  parallels)  would you put on this PB replacement? 98. Right? Maybe Vista too?\r\n\r\nAll
  of this seems obvious, but then again..."

    Almost every Solaris box out there is either a server or a sandbox in some hobbyists
    collection. If there are leftover desktop Solaris users, they're doing scientific/medical
    work where fonts aren't especially important. \r\n\r\nAs for Linux... does anyone
    still take any part of the Linux desktop market seriously? In 2000 the Linux crowd
    couldn't shut up about how close they were to world domination, they're no closer
    now than they were then, and most people using desktop Linux are doing it for
    nerd cred, not because they care about fonts. I could see this being important
    if a few of the governments that keep threatening to move to Linux do so, or if
    the One-Laptop-Per-Child orders actually get filled (and don't end up running
    a stripped version of XP), but right now there's no point. \r\n\r\nRegarding what
    Linux to use on a new Macbook, I'd go with XP unless you have some compelling
    reason to start running an OS that's widely regarded as needing more time in beta. "

    this past year on pushing the linux desktop forward.\r\n\r\nA recent survey (I
    wish I could find the source) stated that 30% of the corporations they interviewed

    recently made major changes in the code that resulted in big differences in the
