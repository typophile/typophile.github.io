  body: "La Pignata is Verona Script by Helmut Hans Matheis, 1958.\r\n\r\nThe only
    digital version I'm aware of was made by <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/denada/dn1.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Mike Allard</a>.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Verona Script was one
    of Allard's commercial fonts and TypOasis offers for download only Allard's fonts
    that were originally free and shareware. The only legitimate way to get hold of
    Allard's Verona Script font would be to contact him.\r\n\r\nNote that Allard's
    Juliet Script is simply a heavier version of Verona Script and you CAN download
    that."
