  body: "The upper case letters are a narrower version of an Art Nouveu typeface called
    \"Breite Halfbette R\xF6misch\" shown in Petzendorfer's book of Art Nouveu alphabets
    (Dover, P.35). The lower case is similar, but certain letters, like the 'a' and
    'y' are differently formed. They are all wider than your sample, just as the caps
    were.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like I can scan the sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hi Mike,\r\nNow that you mention it, this most likely is a repeat request.
    Really appreciate your advice. Yes, a scan of the sample would be wonderful, and
    very generous of you to offer. Thank you so much for your time and energy! I owe
    you big time."

    how to narrow it without torturing it to death.\r\n\r\nReally, really appreciate
    your time and help."
