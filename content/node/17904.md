    common knowledge that Kubrick was a Futura man.

  body: "I went to see the Kubrik exhibition that book was a product of. The display
    typography was nonsense. I asked the organisers what the deal was with the all
    fonts they used that were anything but the fonts featured in Stanley Kubrik's
    films. They had no idea what I was talking about.\r\n\r\nThe answer is, whoever
    designed that book had no idea either and did no research for the design.\r\n\r\nKubrik
    used Futura for the titles of 2001. What other Kubrik films used Futura? \r\nI
    guess \"Kubrick was a Futura man\" is a pun :^)\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    with his assistant  a while back in The Guardian who said that Futura Extra Bold
    was Kubrick's favorite typeface.\r\n\r\nhttp://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,1177734,00.html"

  body: I just remembered that article Mark mentioned. He did use Futura Extra Bold
    in Eyes Wide Shut title sequence, but I'm not sure if the titles were done before
    or after his death.

    before opening the thread I was thinking: \"This'll definitely be Futura\". Surprise
    surprise."

  body: "In the Stanley Kubrick DVD Collection set (R4), All the DVD covers had all
    case spine titles and most front cover titles set in Futura Extra Bold. This input
    probably came from the designer, or suppose it was at the suggestion from some
    of Kubrick's former assistants or colleagues alike. As he had passed on before
    the release of this DVD set.\r\n\r\nBut somehow, Futura just seems appropriate,
    as 2001 was really his masterwork."
