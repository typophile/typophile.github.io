  resource to learn more about hinting and the and more in-depth information on the
  more technical side of FontLab? Learn Font Lab fast is disappointingly simple.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "There anot a ton of resources about hinting. At the very high end you would
    have to contract with companies with special tools etc. And at the low end you
    can auto-hint. In between you might look at these:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeHintingIntro.mspx\r\n\r\nhttp://www.truetype-typography.com/tthints.htm\r\n"

  body: "For me, the best was really attending the TypeTech sessions at ATypi last
    year in Brighton. A lot of things cleared that way. Both with hinting, and other
    technicalities.\r\n\r\nThis year it is in St Petersburg, Russia and I will of
    course go this year to. If you are interested, you could check out if there are
    any hinting sessions this year.\r\n\r\nhttp://atypi.org/05_Petersburg/20_main_program/05_typetech\r\n"
