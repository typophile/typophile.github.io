    on the Bentons you refer to, on p. 42 it reads: \r\n\r\n\u201CFor example, News
    Gothic was cut exactly proportional to the pattern plate. Going down in size,
    the face was actually extended in width but not in height\u2026 In the 1940s \u2026the
    normal practice at Stempel was to produce three sets of patterns for each typeface.
    Adjustments on the machine itself were only used to widen characters in the very
    smallest sizes.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt seems from this there were different philosophies
    involved for using the machine. Also the article mentions that they drew a different
    pattern for each size of their Caslon. \r\n\r\nDid they linearly increase the
    thickness and width, or was this much more pronounced at 6 point? Did thickness
    and width increase together or somethat differently?\r\n\r\nOh, and did they do
    anything about x-height?"

  body: "hrant asks: <cite>In the image, do you think that might be a trap in the
    top-right corner of the lower counter?</cite>\r\n\r\nNo, it doesn't look like
    one to me. I assume that by \"trap\" you mean a wedge taken out of the inner join
    to create a larger negative space on the inside, as in your <a href=\"http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html\">trapping
    article</a>. I see very little evidence for trapping in the ATF oeuvre.\r\n\r\nWilliam:
    I interpret that passage a bit differently (and am referring to my specimen book
    for further support).\r\n\r\nOf the News Gothic, only the 36pt was engraved with
    exactly the same outline as the pattern plate. Smaller sizes were extended and
    heavier compared with the pattern plate, and larger sizes were condensed and lighter.\r\n\r\nAmerican
    Caslon, by comparison, is a fairly extended font already - the \"o\" is pretty
    close to a perfect circle. From my experimentation, if you extend an already wide
    font to try to make optical scales for smaller sizes, it looks wrong. And, indeed,
    if you look at Monotype (metal) Centaur, there's little or no anamorphic scaling
    across the size range. They did use different pattern plates (I've counted four
    size ranges, as discussed in more detail in <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/6592\">this
    thread</a>), and the 'e' is in fact narrower in the smaller sizes than the larger.\r\n\r\n<cite>It
    seems from this there were different philosophies involved for using the machine.
    Also the article mentions that they drew a different pattern for each size of
    their Caslon.</cite>\r\n\r\nYes, there are different philosophies, but there is
    also a lot of commonality. The smaller sizes of Centaur, drawn from different
    pattern plates, show evidence of stroke offset-based weight gain (radius of curvature
    is larger on external corners such as the outer bottom of the 'v', smaller on
    internal corners, than in display sizes), just as do the ATF Bodonis, all scaled
    from a single pattern plate. I think it's likely that they used the stroke offset
    adjustments across the size range so that there wouldn't be a noticeable jump
    in appearance from the largest size in one range to the smallest size in the next
    (12pt to 14pt, in the case of Centaur).\r\n\r\nMost of the ATF fonts used a single
    pattern plate for all sizes, but there certainly are exceptions. The Garamonds
    used two, one for 6-12, another for 14 and up (more details <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/5901\">here</a>).
    Some of their fonts seem to use many pattern plates. I count at least four in
    the Baskerville: 6-10, 12, 14-24, and 30-up. Of these, the 12 looks a <em>lot</em>
    like Stempel (Linotype) Baskerville, the 30 and up is essentially Fry's Baskerville.
    The other two are not as good.\r\n\r\nScotch Roman (pp. 394 and 395 of the <a
    href=\"http://levien.com/type/atf_1912/\">1912 book</a>) also has more than two,
    but I'm unsure of the exact number (the difference between 18 and 24 is especially
    noticeable, because the former's 'e' has vertical stress like you'd expect of
    a Modern, while the latter's stress is about 15 degrees from vertical, more like
    Caslon).\r\n\r\nWilliam also asked: <cite>Did they linearly increase the thickness
    and width, or was this much more pronounced at 6 point? Did thickness and width
    increase together or somethat differently?</a>\r\n\r\nMy observation is that the
    scaling ratio and stroke offset vary linearly with the <em>reciprocal</em> of
    the point size. And yes, they do vary together. In the very smallest sizes of
    some fonts (I've observed this in Century Catalogue but not Bodoni), there is
    an additional factor at play: the extenders (especially descenders) are shortened
    and the x-height correspondingly raised. I believe the width scaling fits the
    rest of the curve closely, but the height scaling is higher because of this x-height
    tweak.\r\n"

  body: "Peter: You've asked a very good question indeed. I have a hunch about the
    answer, but quite a bit more work is needed to fill it in.\r\n\r\nKevin Parker's
    research strongly supports the theory that contrast is the primary factor in readability.
    I suspect that a measurement of the relative contrast of optically scaled vs.
    mathematically scaled font sizes will show a contrast advantage for optical scaling.\r\n\r\nHow
    should contrast be measured? There are a number of possibilities suggested in
    the literature. One is to just weight by a contrast sensitivity function, as in
    my <a href=\"http://levien.com/artofcode/ei04/\">Electronic Imaging '04 paper</a>.
    There are, of course, several choices for the CSF, depending on whether you're
    going for threshold sensitivity, and how wide a visual field you're targeting.
    Another very intriguing possibility is to band-pass for the octave of spatial
    frequencies responsible for 90% of the readability. (<a href=\"http://www.opticsexpress.org/ViewMedia.cfm?id=63459&seq=0\">this
    paper</a> is the same research as one you cited in your TYPO 13 paper, yes?)\r\n\r\nYou
    can measure empirically using actual fonts, or you can try to use an analytic
    model (the model I used in my EI '04 paper, with variable grating width and duty
    cycle, is probably a good starting point). A 50% duty cycle always gives you the
    greatest contrast when your CSF is a lowpass filter, but in the case of bandpass
    I suspect you'll see your contrast peak at lower duty cycles, more so as the grating
    width increases. That prediction would match the practice of optical scaling fairly
    well, although I'm not sure whether that you'd see a clean linear relationship
    with the grating width.\r\n\r\nTo some extent, I'm not sure that a deep analysis
    of this effect has that great a payoff. We <em>know</em> that optical scaling
    is a Good Thing(tm), and we have decades of experience of how to do it well, at
    least for print. Perhaps the biggest payoff will be the understanding of optical
    scaling for screen rendering, a relatively unexplored area in the literature.\r\n\r\nGiampa:

    \r\n\r\nIf I'm not mistaken, Gerrit Noordzij relates the need for scaling to Fresnel
    zones. Noordzij claims the impact of these zones is never considered. Certainly
    they aren't in Pelli's \"contrast energy\" calculations.\r\n\r\nHard to sort through,
    all this stuff.\r\n\r\nYou say the payoff of deep analysis might not be great
    because we already know the benefits of optical spacing and how to do it well.
    But if we knew the perceptual mechanics underlying this bit of craft knowledge,
    we might put this practice on a firmer footing. If the phenomenon is spatial frequency
    band related, scaling might need to follow a quantum rather than a standard algorithmic
    model. It would be interesting to determine if prior to the pantograph the scaling
    might have been more quantal than standardly algorithmico-mechanical. \r\n\r\nOr
    am I showing my ATF ignorance here?\r\n\r\nHow does scaling pre and post pantograph
    manifest in the frequency domain?"
