body: Hi there, this logo is designed for a florist who have been established for
  more than 20 years. Their current logo is quite outdated. Now that there are many
  competitors out there, the owner wanted a facelift of the current logo and keeping
  it rather simple and unique. The main target audience is young executives, largely
  female. The client had requested to use the alphabet &#39;P&#39; as part of the
  logo. For 1A, I have use &#39;P&#39; with a curve join to the other end to form
  a flower. To reflect the freshness of the flowers, I have picked a brighter color
  palette.  <BR> <BR>Currently, I am unsure whether the brandmark works on its own.
  Also, I m quite disturbed by the placement of the brandmark when placed together
  with the logotype. <BR> <BR>What do you guys think about this? Looking forward to
  any comments or ideas. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>Chilla <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47528.jpg"

  body: Hello. I don&#39;t like series 1 or 2a. But I do like 2b and the direction
    it&#39;s going. 2c is bland and I don&#39;t understand the letter &#39;p&#39;.
    And because the target is young executives you might want to play around with
    a typeface that is more modern, perhaps a sans serif font&#40;anything but Helvetica&#41;.

  body: Hey IM, thanks for the quick comment. I am still in the midst of picking a
    font, and it seems that a sans serif font would be better than a serif. Personally
    I like 2B too but I would have to worked on 2B more to see how it could be better.  <BR>

  body: Chilla, if they are going to use the mark as 4 color or on a website you might
    actually use flower images and incorporate a p or P into the image of the flower
    changing the flowers and the p&#39;s. This is more of CI idenity rather than a
    logo. If you take any of your 1a-1d marks alone they don&#39;t read either p or
    flower. I think you need to be more direct.

  body: Randy, thanks for the font recommendation. Real nice and elegant. I agree
    with you after trying out the sans. For some reasons, I feel that serif works
    better than a sans. I have a  version that has some similar properties of a Trajan.
    I feel that calligraphic font adds on to that interesting character to the word
    &#39;Princess&#39;. I am no a expert in typography or font &#39;engineering&#39;
    but am interested to create/modify the font if this font can&#39;t work. <BR>

  body: Be careful about trying to do too many things here. You&#39;ve got a  <BR>swash
    R, a pink flower, an unusual E, and two unusual S&#39;s. They  <BR>all want your
    attention. Focus on one or two methinks. <BR> <BR>Swash letters are really hard
    to draw on a computer. Too often,  <BR>the swashes just look unnatural. Your R
    is suffering that a bit  <BR>plus it&#39;s creating a spacing problem for you.
    Print it out large  <BR>and work over the shape with a pencil to get better flow.
    Maybe  <BR>try to use the swash to tie the Princess to the word Flowers  <BR>which
    is floating now. <BR> <BR>The C &#43; - = E is an ok idea, but note that the cross
    bar should  <BR>be thin for proper modulation. <BR> <BR>Like mike, the SS bugs.
    It&#39;s too Klingon for a princess IMHO. <BR> <BR>I like the flower in 2B because
    it reminds me of a Tiara. Maybe  <BR>try pushing that connection a bit &#40;but
    lean toward more floral  <BR>and less representational tiara&#41;. Have fun! <BR>

    &amp; Frere-Jones. I believe its a beautiful alternative to Trajan.  <BR>Why not
    give the letter &#39;N&#39; a swash, it can go under the letter &#39;C&#39; plus
    it won&#39;t give you the spacing problems you have with the &#39;R&#39; swash.

    and make the &#39;N&#39; swash look more natural, It&#39;s not flowing as well
    as it should, I suggest you do what Mr. Jones suggested about making good swash
    curves. Also try the word with a regular &#39;E&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Oh and one more
    thing, the circle in the flower seem to be a little off form the letter &#39;I&#39;

    you can curve the end of the swash to correspond with the letter &#39;c&#39;.
    Or maybe its just that the swash is connected to the word flowers, it&#39; seem
    a bit off to me.  <BR> <BR>Also the flower at the top of the lette &#39;I&#39;
    seem a bit to bold or thick for the lettering, maybe making it a little smaller
    or lightening the color might make it come together better. Again this is just
    my opinion. Keep it up. <BR> <BR>IM

    color treatment for signage and the van and another for stationary.
