  Miehle Gothic but have not been able to find it. Monotype has a few Miehles but
  no Gothic. In fact the faces look more like semi serifs then gothics. Also, if anyone
  can add to or subtract from the list below please do. They must have been designed
  by Benton not reworked such as Globe Gothic (as far as what I have been able to
  ascertain).\r\n\r\nFranklin Gothic 1902\r\nAlternate Gothic 1903\r\nClearface Gothic

  body: "AFAICT, \"Miehle Gothic\" would be a wider version of the semi-serif design
    in question.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mac McGrew's American Metal Typefaces of the
    Twentieth Century, which shows Miehle Extra Condensed, \"Normal and and Condensed
    widths [of Miehle] were drawn but apparently not completed.\"\r\n\r\nI once had
    a particular interest in the Miehle faces for a project I was working on, and
    even did a quickie digitization of Miehle Extra Condensed. I've never seen any
    further info on the other faces, although if there were any it would probably
    be at either Columbia University or the Smithsonian.\r\n\r\nPatricia Cost might
    also have more info, if you can get it from her.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    Myfonts today to purchase so may be ancient history - they do know about it if
    you Google "ATMiehle-Condensed"

    Gothic does not exists.
