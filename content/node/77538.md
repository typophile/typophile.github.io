body: "Hi guys. I was recently approached by a publisher of historical novels to help
  develope their identity and wanted to ask for your advice on the type choice. The
  books aren\u2019t confined to any specific period which makes it a little harder.
  The identity wil have to work online, so I\u2019m particulary interested in well
  hinted @font-face licensed fonts.\r\n\r\nFF Clifford is the first thing that came
  to mind, as it is relatively silent all the while it\u2019s ruggedness really fits
  my bill, and the optical sizes and hinting is spot on. I\u2019ve also looked into
  antique map fonts, like for example Tierra Nueva, and consider trying a modern/didone
  of some kind. (Whatever I end up using should be relatively consistent in a historical
  context, so I probably won\u2019t mix Clifford with any didones \u2026 Just saying.)
  Nick Shinn\u2019s Figgins Sans is also on my list.\r\n\r\nThey use Trajan (the obivious
  choice) in their logo, but I hope to be able to tweak that one ever so slightly
  without abandoning the feel of it.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not only looking for web ready
  text fonts, but also just plain display stuff. Any ideas and/or inspiration when
  it comes to graphic style or type treatment are also welcome. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m basically
  trying to create something generic ancient, while hopefully managing to avoid the
  clich\xE9s.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    of the typical shopping basket, and also symbols for price listings and such). "

  body: "Rather than choose a single text typeface for the entire series, I'd suggest
    working out a more flexible but easily recognizable visual identity, which could
    accommodate different typefaces for different books -- especially books about
    different historical periods. (Not that the typeface has to be from the same period,
    just that it has to feel compatible.) That would also give you the flexibility
    to use a different typeface online than on paper, if need be.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    as you asked about \"antique map fonts,\" I'd suggest taking a look at Mark van
    Bronkhorst's MVB Sirenne family, which was based on the engraved lettering used
    for captions and other map-like information in an 18th-century book from a map
    publisher in Amsterdam. \r\n\r\nhttp://mvbfonts.com/mvb_sirenne/\r\n\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I thought about choosing [[http://www.fontbureau.com/media/pdf/PoynterOSText.pdf|Poynter]]
    for a book project lately. It is elegant (cap P, G, Q etc), yet relatively generic
    in style. Though having it's roots in low-country Renaissance it could fit Baroque
    and later texts too. Plus you can get different optically scaled variants for
    different sizes and [[http://www.webtype.com/font/poynterserifre-family/|a well
    hinted version for the web]] via webtype. Or maybe you find some others over there.
    http://www.webtype.com/catalog/style/?ts=692\r\n\r\nBut Clifford is a good pick,
    too, the FF-fonts usually work well on screen. \r\nI'd go for some late moderate
    Renaissance or Baroque face, something that sits a bit in between the historic
    periods and doesn't resemble one particular style so much."

    as well, optical sizes, ornaments and other goodies.

  body: "Sorry for the late response. These are excellent suggestions! Thank you.
    I really like Poynter. Both it and Clifford are my best bets for now, for text
    use. I\u2019m particulary drawn to Clifford for the optical sizes. That\u2019s
    one helluva overlooked aspect of web design.\r\n\r\nAs for different typefaces
    for different books, John, the books already have their own set of fonts that
    does not necessarily adhere to their historical period. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll have
    to ask Nick about the rendering quality of Figgins.\r\n\r\nSirenne is also an
    excellent idea. I\u2019m up for more suggestions, btw.\r\n\r\nFor Christmas, mum
    bought me a dictionary of symbols which should get me started on that front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    They\u2019re very passionate about the whole thing (the head guy lives in an old
    prison filled with art, books, pipes (yeay!), grandfather clocks and tons of antiques),
    but they did chose a not-so-great designer the first time around which makes me
    somewhat vary about how much they\u2019ll really appreciate my work."

    authenticity, I'd certainly take a look at Giovanni Mardersteig's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/dante/|Dante]],
    and for your Didone style, DSType's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/andrade-pro/|Andrade]].

    requires some deeper research, perhaps. The fist is always fitting, I suppose.
    Maybe, you ought to go to a library and scroll through the advertising pages of
    old newspapers. Gorgeous graphics are to be found in that quite often."
