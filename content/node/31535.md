    disorders as a topic for the design of display typefaces. The disorder that i
    am onto now is OCD..\r\n\r\nI wanna make a type face that strikes through the
    last word you wrote and writes it just above (kinda as soon as you press the space
    bar)\r\n\r\nin my head it would work like a ligature.. in the sense that it would
    change to a different image, but then its not possible becausea ligature seems
    to be a pre determined image.. and i cant predetermine eveyr word in the dictionary...\r\n\r\nso
    i was wondering if there is a way of making an automated strike through the last
    word you wrote (without pressing the strike through button - think interactive
    display of OCD)..\r\n\r\ni really hope this makes sense... i can draw a diagram
    :) :) :)\r\n\r\nthanks anyway!"

  body: "I am not sure if I understand what you are asking for. I waited, and no one
    else has jumped in, so perhaps a clearer explanation would help?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    if I get what you are describing, the answer is probably, \"no.\" That sort of
    event is beyond the intentions of OpenType, as far as I have heard or imagined.
    However, even as I say that, there <em>might</em> be some way to hack it to do
    so....\r\n\r\n<strong>If it is even possible</strong> you would likely need some
    sort of generationg script to create a bruteforst word-string set. Start with
    a substitution for each character with a struck alternate. Add a condition to
    apply it when a space appears after 1,2,3,4,5,6... characters. That would require
    a contextual rule that can allow wildcards between the character to be subbed,
    or a script to generate all possible combinations. I think the former is a no-go.
    The latter is probably the only possible way, and would result in a set of tasks
    that would likley bog down any OT rendering engine beyond usablity.\r\n\r\nWhen
    then leads to, what application would you be trying to present this in, that supports
    OT in the way you want?\r\n\r\nYou might be best off creating some sort of flash
    demo with actionscript or a similar lightweight language and presentation app.\r\n\r\nSorry
    I can't be more definite here. OpenType is a dark and nebulous  art, like immortality
    or understanding women. ;)"

      of opentype.. i can see it being made in flash.. but i wanted to actually have
      it as a working indesign ready font.\r\nhaving just recently discovered the
      necessity for coding a typeface i was keen to find the potential opentype might
      have.\r\n\r\nChoz. im quite interesed in the latter possibility however like
      u said it would probably bog down the thing beyond belief...\r\n\r\nmight give
      it a go, see if it works\r\nif not\r\nah well.. back to the drawing board..\r\n\r\nthanks

    \ so far, so I'd love to hear the outcome of your efforts either way. Or any other
    insights from this that relate to applications outside of traditional typography
    and internationalization, which it was intended for.\r\n\r\nTo increase you general

    I asked for weeks ago</a> but also sounds very promising for developing Arabic
    Ligatures.

  body: "Actually, I can easily see how to do this in OpenType. You don't need any
    dictionaries of words or anything, just a backwards chaining contextual substitution.
    Same techniques I used to produce some of the fancy effects in the sample contextual
    code I posted a couple of years ago.\r\n\r\nPart of the trick is to use individual
    letter substitutions rather than any ligature stuff.\r\n\r\nOne way of doing it
    would be with some code that in FontLab or the Adobe FDK looks like this:\r\n<code>\r\nfeature
    calt { # Contextual Alternates\r\n   sub @reg_let' @reg_let @reg_let @reg_let
    space by @spec_let\r\n   sub @reg_let' @reg_let @reg_let space by @spec_let\r\n
    \  sub @reg_let' @reg_let space by @spec_let\r\n   sub @reg_let' space by @spec_let\r\n}
    calt;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nMind you, that's a simplified version which will only
    work with words up to four letters long, but I'm sure you get the idea. You just
    need to define each of those glyph classes to include the same number of glyphs,
    and create an entire set of extra \"special\" glyphs in the font, where each one
    has the \"regular\" glyph struck through, plus the same glyph without the strike-through
    raised above it.\r\n\r\nSomebody with a bit of Python experience could doubtless
    automate the creation of those added glyphs, btw.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\nThomas

  body: "Hmmm, just to add to that, perhaps instead of using \"space\" in the code
    above, you would want some sort of class of \"word-ending characters\" including
    space, period, question, exclam, and so on.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Whether or not it is beyond the capabilities of OT, the request doesn't make
    sense. Why exactly do you need to wait for the space to be typed for the effect
    to occur per word?
