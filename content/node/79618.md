    There are plenty of books of those.\r\n\r\nI'll add some more once I've had a

  body: "This book is amazing: <em>L'affiche dans le monde</em> by Alain Weill. \r\n\r\nIt
    has a lot of advertising design, mainly posters, from product, \r\nto art to politics
    from the type-focused beginning in th pre 19th \r\ncentury time, and the development
    of graphic design throughout \r\nthe late 19th and 20th century, up until the
    1990s a bit as well. \r\nIt gives not only a more detailed account over many designs
    from \r\nup until mid 20th century, but as well a selected and sound over-\r\nview
    over advertising in Russia, China, Cuba, Japan, and other \r\nplaces of the world,
    as well as an overview over the second half of\r\nthe 20th century. \r\n\r\nIt
    is not produced anymore, was published in the late 1990s and\r\none can still
    find plenty of used copies on amazon.fr or ebay or \r\nwith a simple google search.\r\n\r\n"
