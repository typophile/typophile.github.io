  ago and now I'm trying to get the typography right.\r\nTeams for women and men.
  They have a solid community with a lot of social activity besides the sport. Easy
  going friendly bunch that loves a loud party.\r\nThey insist on Cooper Black, and
  I think it suits them well, but I think having all the text in CB is to heavy. I
  need a second font that goes well with CB and the spirit of the team. I think Comic
  Sans might work, although, after hanging around this place I should maybe know better.\r\nWide
  open to suggestions/critique on fonts, kerning, sizes or the logo in general.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uwrugby_5205.gif]"

  body: "Fun logo. I'd start by suggesting you center the type under the two people
    disregarding the water. I also think the two lines are set too tight and too close,
    especially giving how large your word space is in between the two words in the
    top line.\r\n\r\nIf the mark isn't set in stone I might also consider not overlapping
    the water on the people. It seems a little distracting, especially at small sizes.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and are you looking for type crit or is this the type you are to use?"

    weights of Cooper which might work better for this logo.\r\n\r\nI agree with Tiffany
    that the text should be centred under the circle, not the entire logo. I also
    agree that the lines of text are way too tight.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see a version
    without bubbles. They won't reproduce well at small sizes, and the perfect circles
    seem out of place in such an organic mark.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Hi, thanks for comments!\r\nMiss Tiffany, here it is centred under the two
    people with no water. I added a little weight to them to see what happened since
    I thought they looked a bit skinny. I also removed the small text for now. The
    mark is in no way set in stone except that it must be Cooper Black for the \u201CSURK
    TSI\u201D part, or all text if possible. I\u2019m all ear about kerning and spacing,
    to me it looks fine, you think the space is to wide between the two words?\r\n\r\nLex,
    Comic Sans in a logo may be stretching it a bit to far. Thanks for the font tips.
    I like the liveliness of the bubbles for this logo, but I see that they may be
    to small and to many. I do not think that they seem out of place as they are randomly
    distributed and as a group they have an organic presence.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uwrugby2_4747.gif]"

    (btw, it's an old ATF cut that i posted for reference), but over all i think you
    found your own balance. the tushes and the torsos might be toned down a bit? and
    the quads a bit larger? but overall i think this is nicer than your other heavied-up
    versions. can we see what this mark looks like with the type?

    more toward the ... ahem ... cheeks. I also think the women's left arm could use
    a tiny bit more muscular definition. (Her outer leg too, her thigh look a little
    lumpy.) The man's outer leg, the calf to foot seems deformed somehow."

    my eyes the weight of the text and the figure should be about this ratio. I'm
    struggeling to keep inside of the original concept with the two divers inside
    a circle. The concept is why the legs was so distorted. Moving towards more realistic
    figures, the circle is getting invisible and the concept is fading. Anyway, how

    a substitute font that is more relevant to this new look. Miss Tiffany, I do not
    know how to determin the best line spacing. How do you see that it is to tight?
    I tend to want to put the lines as close together as possible. Are there any rules
    to follow in a case like this logo?\r\nIt is \"TSI SURK\", plus the long tagline,
    sorry for not being consistent. \r\nI like your suggestion about the suggesting
    line verdiinpink. If I where to use a suggesting line for the back of the woman,
    I think it would be something like in the attached picture. I rather avoid it
    in the b/w version because it makes the logo less interesting I think.\r\nYes
    the ball is round, and filled with something a little heavier than swimming pool
    water, so it will slowly sink. I think the size is about the same as a handball.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uwrugby2_6362.jpg]"

  body: "I'm jumping in a bit late (and there hasn't been an update to this article
    in about 3 weeks) so I don't know if this will be helpful or not.\r\n\r\nFirst
    off I love the progression of the illustration. Bjorn, you have quite a talent,
    it was very impressive to see the slight variations over time.\r\n\r\nBut, I'm
    afraid you haven't hit it with the type. It almost seems like the type is an after
    thought (which I suspect it is.) For starters the layout seems a bit neutral.
    Since you've created such a beautiful image, you should have type that helps not
    hinders the final product. If you're going with stacked type look, consider reducing
    the size of the tag-line so it's not the same width as the name. This will hint
    of a pedestal for your image to \"sit on\".\r\n\r\nAlso, I think you might want
    to consider more contrast between your type selections. Cooper Black with another
    rounded sans for the tag is almost too similar. Rugby isn't a gentle sport, where
    it might be more graceful in the water, I'm sure there is still high levels of
    aggression during play. I'm envisioning a black chiseled slab-serif for TSI SURK
    with a muted rounded sans for the tag-line. It'll have the aggression I expect
    from rugby with softened effect that helps illustrate the water arena.\r\n\r\nsuggestion:
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/emigre/malaga_black/?sample_text=TSI%20SURK&sample_size=74\">Malaga
    black </a>for TSI SURK and maybe <a href=\"http://vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/\">Omnes
    medium</a> for the tag-line.\r\n\r\nGood luck. \r\n\r\n"

    Sorry for not keeping you updated, I was hoping to have something to show before
    posting.\r\n\r\nI have been looking on all the fonts suggested, thanks Wesley.Bancroft
    and gabssnake, all of them is for sure nice. Sadly I have not been able to implement
    any of them.\r\n\r\nThe logo has been resting for a while and in that time I got
    an idea that we'll try to follow through:\r\nWe are in the progress of sampling
    handwriting from the members in order to make a tag line from the samples. Due
    to holidays and no deadline we have not been able to collect the samples yet.
    \r\nI'm a bit excited about this concept for the tag line. \r\nFirst because it
    make a nice connection between the members of the team and the logo since they
    get to participate and see their own graphics in the design. \r\nSecond because
    I finally have a defined \"concept box\" to work inside.\r\nThird because of the
    challenge, vectorizing the samples, putting them together and see how it turns
    out. \r\nIt may be a total fiasco, time will show.\r\n\r\nThe typography is indeed
    an afterthought Asvetic. I find typography very difficult and interesting.\r\n\r\nI
    do not think that we will scrap Cooper Black. I will on the other hand definitely
    try out your suggestions concerning adjustments. Rugby is pretty brutal but we
    do not want to focus on the brutality. The team want to encourage female players
    to join and we hope a friendly logo is better than a brutal one.\r\n\r\nFor the
    record: placing this logo on the chopping block, in the critique section of Typophile,
    means that I welcome any critique, in any shape or form. \r\n\r\nAgain thanks
    for critique and suggestions from all of you, I'm learning a lot from them. The
    team love the logo and says hello! I'll post back once I have something to show.\r\n\r\nBest
