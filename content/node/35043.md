  body: "Jan beat me to it. This lettering can't be purchased. It's written by hand,
    not using a font. Here are some font ideas: \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000267\">Burgues
    Script</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/bickham_script_pro_ot/\">Bickham
    Script</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/polonaise_bold_ot_std_urw/\">Polonaise</a>\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_edwardian_script/\">ITC
    Edwardian Script</a>\r\n\r\nBut the best way to emulate this look is to hire a
    good calligrapher."
