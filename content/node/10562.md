  out of ideas on this one. Here&#39;s the only sample that I have: <BR> <BR>&#60;img&#62;
  <BR><a href="http://www.newwestfunding.com/menu01.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.newwestfunding.com/menu01.jpg</a>
  <BR> <BR>To me, it looks exactly like Trebuchet MS, with the exception of the stepped
  W. It also looks quite a bit like a more slender EF Today Sans Serif H, but I don&#39;t
  know where to go from there. Any help would be appreciated!'
