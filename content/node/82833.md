  body: "I love how Tomi's script ignores the baseline.\r\nMister K is brilliant in
    many ways, but it sticks too close to the baseline for an otherwise casual and
    idiosyncratic face. Still, that does make it \"loose but not overly sloppy\",
    as requested."

    pretty dang close to what I had envisaged. Added bonus: it will give me an excuse
    to use the term \"kafkaesque\" in client presentations. Although, that might not
    go over so well. \r\n\r\nJ"
