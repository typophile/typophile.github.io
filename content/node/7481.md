body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Can anyone tell me the name &#40;or truetype/abobe equivalent&#41;
  of the attached link. It comes from a masonic notice from 1924 and was also used
  on a local newspaper &#40;Malvern Gazette&#41; around 1900/1920&#39;s. <BR> <BR>http://www.firstpaige.co.uk/font.JPG
  <BR> <BR>thanks in advance <BR> <BR>chaz

  body: You haven&#39;t given us much to go on - it&#39;s an uncial - closest I found
    on a quick search was <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/clairvaux/"
    target="_blank">Clairvaux</a> - maybe that&#39;s good enough. Since your sample
    is so old, the actual font may not be digitized.

    looking though <BR> <BR>cheers <BR> <BR>Chaz

  body: It&#39;s more a Schwabacher than an Uncial, I think. Anyway, the Schwabacher
    _a_ is usually single storied. Still searching. <BR> <BR>jmc _=&#43;
