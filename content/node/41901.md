  body: "Confirmed. Eurostile Bold Condensed. Dark Side of the Moon and FOR ALL FESTIVAL\u2026
    are set in different weights of the extended. The lighter text in the lineup is
    Eurostile Condensed.\r\n\r\nI used the Adobe Open Type version and optical kerning
    set to 0 for the lineup unless a small adjustment needed to be made.\r\n\r\nGOLDENVOICE
    PRESENTS is set in Berthold Akzidenz Extended, COACHELLA is hand done, COACHELLA
    VALLEY ARTS\u2026 is set in DIN and then I believe I got back to Eurostile.\r\n\r\npbc"

    thread about handlettering.

    it was a bit hard to remember\u2026 :)\r\n\r\nThe identity grew like a weed -
    finally the city of Indio demanded that we give them some props or they wouldn't
    let us hold the festival there. Gotta love design decisions forced on you by bureaucrats.
    They were mad that the festival was called Coachella even though it was actually
    in Indio.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "Hi Paul\r\nDo you know if it's possible to get the Hand Drawn  \"Coachella\"
    \ font? I do a T-shirt for me and a couple of friends to wear each year and I
    send Golden Voice one for them. I do it just to show support and advertise Coachella.
    Yes, I buy 3 - 7 of their shirts every year, but some of the designs don't do
    enough to show how cool it is, so I do one that incorporates some of the images
    that make it special from teh previous year, so I can explain it to people that
    don't go. I think it would be better to use their type instead of something I
    come up with, to make the event more recognizable!\r\nThanks\r\nA "
