body: "Greetings.\r\n\r\nI was wondering whether anyone here has got the font Monotype
  Ehrhardt.  If so, may I ask where you got it, and whether your version has a full
  set of characters with diacritics and uncommon characters, especially characters
  no longer used for writing English (ash, thorn, eth, yogh)?  I have a few books
  that are in Monotype Ehrhardt that do include such characters, but I have seen no
  downloadable versions of this font that do.  Perhaps I have not looked hard or carefully
  enough, though.\r\n\r\nI also wonder whether there is a Monotype Ehrhardt font for
  the Greek alphabet, complete with breathings, accents and other diacritics as well
  as older Greek characters used as numbers (the digamma, for instance).  The Penguin
  Edition of John Milton\u2019s Complete Poems uses Monotype Ehrhardt for Milton\u2019s
  English, Italian and Latin poems, and uses what appears to be Monotype Ehrhardt
  Greek characters for Milton\u2019s Greek poems.  This is probably my favourite Greek
  font.\r\n\r\nAny information would be much appreciated.\r\n"

    a few years ago. There is no Greek version of Ehrhardt included, or shown in their
    catalog. I'm afraid I don't offhand know what the special characters are that
    you mentioned.  I could look at character map, but I don't know what I'm looking
    for.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, how did you decide that your book used Ehrhardt
    Greek? The characters have no obvious relation to the Latin letters, so unless
    the typeface were identified as 'Ehrhardt Greek' what could you base that on?\r\n\r\n-

      that both the Roman and Greek alphabets share (A, B, E, Z, H, I, K, M, N, O,
      P, T, Y), the Greek characters in my book look (to me) exactly like their Roman
      counterparts in Ehrhardt.  However, when I look now, I do see some small differences,
      so it may very well not be Ehrhardt at all.  If you like, I can scan a page
      and show it to you.\r\n\r\nThe book states in its imprint that the book is set
      in Monotype Ehrhardt.  No other font is mentioned, so I assumed that the Greek
      characters were part of the same font."

    version shown on Monotype's site</a>, and it shows the eth and thorn, as well
    as a number of other non-Latin characters. I did not see a yogh, and I still don't
    know what an ash is. Since Monotype has also begun releasing their fonts in OpenType
    versions, I expect many of the more obscure characters may well be included in
    the extended character sets.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    type, who knows whether Monotype made a Greek Ehrhardt in metal? (I'll bet there
    are Lists of the Monotype metal faces somewhere).\r\n\r\nI can understand from
    your explanation, how you could see similarities between the Latin and Greek --
    of course I was thinking of the Greek letters that look nothing like Latin letters.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be good to see a scan of some of the Greek text that shows Ehrhardt features.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Probably too late to be of any use to Percival, but here goes:\r\n\r\nThe
    Greek text in the Penguin Milton's Complete Poems is something very like [[http://image.linotype.com/samples/hirespdf/9177.pdf|Linotype
    Baskerville Greek]], an upright, serifed Greek with a very roman feel to most
    of the letters (what is effectively an inverted \u2018y\u2019 standing in for
    lambda, for example). It has nothing - typographically - to do with the surrounding
    English and Latin text in Ehrhardt.\r\n\r\nThe forms of the Old and Middle English
    characters thorn, yogh, and eth, often found in company with Monotype Ehrhardt
    in Oxford University Press books (and particularly in editions published by them
    for the Early English Text Society), are, as far as I am aware, custom sorts from
    outside the main font (Ehrhardt), inserted into the text when called for. Some
    confirmation that this is the case can be had by glancing at a book like Michael
    Lapidge's [[http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780198131830|The Cult of St Swithun]],
    (OUP, 2003), which, although set throughout in Monotype Bembo, uses versions of
    thorn and yogh in setting Middle English which are identical to those found alongside
    Ehrhardt elsewhere. \r\n\r\nAs far as I'm aware, the only easily obtainable (for
    a considerable price, though you do get a dictionary thrown in) typefaces to contain
    these \u2018signature\u2019 OUP forms of thorn, eth, yogh (and also wyn and the
    insular flat-topped \u2018g\u2019) are those [[http://www.oup.co.uk/ep/cdroms/ors/|versions
    of Plantin bundled with the electronic version of the OED]].\r\n\r\nAnother commercial
    font which contains yogh is Adobe [[http://store1.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/GRPP/GaramondPremrPro.pdf|Garamond
    Premier Pro]], which also contains thorn and eth (albeit these last two in their
    more rounded and familiar Icelandic forms). Free fonts containing these characters
    include SIL's [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium|Gentium]]
    and [[http://junicode.sourceforge.net/|Peter Baker's Junicode]]. This last is
    of particular interest, as it is intended entirely as a font for medievalists,
    and contains the distinctively insular versions of thorn, eth, yogh, wyn, &c,
    which are not far removed from those found in OUP books.  \r\n\r\nFinally, it
    should be noted that yogh should no longer be subject to any typographical confusion
    with ezh (although a flat-topped ezh is still often used in scholarly editions
    to represent yogh). Unicode now encodes yogh separately at codes U+021C and U+021D."
