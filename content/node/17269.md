  however, I was wondering if anyone could identify this font (pictured in the 2 images
  below). There was a case at the WTF forums and nobody ever identified, hoping someone
  here would be of more help. Thanks in advance. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/worlds1.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/worlds2.jpg]"

  body: "Actually - the typeface <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=10791\"
    target=\"_blank\">WAS identified</a> on WTF as Binderstyle (AKA Binderstile) Bold
    by Philippe. I don't think there's any doubt of that. It's a matter of finding
    a digital font that matches. I offered up Brendel's Report Light stretched as
    the only digital version I knew of. I goofed, though, because I just tried <a
    href=\"http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Report Bold</a> stretched
    and it comes even closer.\r\n\r\nNow, though, I know that Opti also made a version
    that they called <a href=\"http://www.castcraft-software.com/designer1/designer1.04.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Binder Style Bold</a>. There's no way to know if this was the
    font used from the limited preview that Castcraft gives you (and they're the ONLY
    place to get Opti fonts today), but movie studio designers seem to be one of the
    few folks who still are using (rather expensive) Opti fonts."

  body: Thank you. I had read about Binderstyle on WTF and was still unsure. Thank
    you for the further information about Report Bold and the Opti fonts. :)
