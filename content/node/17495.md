  a pain in the arse, though in places, I can see why it's necessary. There should
  be a tick box option...\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Ok, so after a lot of searching, reading manuals all I''ve come up with is
    this (and it''s far from ideal) -- if a contour is broken, you can still embolden
    it without merging occuring to that particular contour, and anything that overlaps
    it. The result isn''t exactly the same as a normal bold transformation, as in
    normal circumstances at a point of intersection, there needs to be a node that
    sits on a unit. Makes sense. Now is there a way of doing this that does makes
    sense..! '
