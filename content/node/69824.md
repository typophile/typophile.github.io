body: "Last year I was working on this font that I eventually got frustrated with,
  mainly because it looked like rubbish.\r\n\r\nSo in the last few days I decided
  to have another stab at it: starting from scratch, I drew something that I think
  might be worth following through with.\r\n\r\nI only have a screenshot at this time,
  because I haven't started compiling the outlines into an actual font yet, so you'll
  have to make do with how it looks in Illustrator!\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the capitals
  are not yet done, nor are the numbers. But I do have a full lower case set and ligatures.\r\n\r\nAny
  comments would be most appreciated!"

  body: "Wherever curves run into stems (for example at the top left of /n/) it's
    conventional, and almost always preferable, to thin out the curving stroke. Otherwise
    those intersections tend to look clotted and too dark.\r\n\r\nMore on that and
    other tips can be found here:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/2010/on-typography/making-geometric-type-work/"

  body: "I think the dots on the i and j need to be moved to the right and raised
    quite a bit.\r\nYou need some consistency , why is the n different than the m,
    why is the terminal on the k's stem different than the l, h and b. I like the
    Interstate-ish k however it's too narrow compared to the y, x and o. I like the
    shape of the y, it's leaning a bit to the right like an Italic (find a way to
    get rid of that), the really big descender and the small x-height may be a nice
    feature.\r\nTry sketching your typeface with pencil, you'll probably end up thinning
    out the curves at the intersections, but also the movement of your hand will add
    a consistency in the flow. Try that and then go back to the computer and imitate
    your drawings."
