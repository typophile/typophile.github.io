  One might even go as far to say that I would travel to Germany just to see it in
  use. But I was wondering whether there were any \"alternatives\" (specifically to
  the sans-serif face)? By \"alternatives\" I don't mean copies, but rather faces
  that follow a similar set of principles. For instance, I would consider Forza (http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100041)
  by Hoefler & Frere-Jones to be along similar lines... it's refined, quite \"square\",
  the wonderful way that strokes meet vertical strokes by thinning etc etc.\r\n\r\nIs
  there anything that springs to mind?\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

    in its normal width, has a bit of the same flavor. Mostly from the shared characteristic
    of emphasized inktraps.

    the Office version of DB Sans used Arial's metrics, and this was added almost
    a year after the rest was completed. I really wanted them to get a Mono instead,
    which looked cool but was a bit too eccentric for intra-corporate correspondence...\r\n\r\nDB
    Sans shares some DNA with FF Unit, which started as an earlier attempt by Erik
    Spiekermann and I at the DB corporate face. Fred Smeijers's wonderful Fresco Sans
    has a similar eccentricity in the terminals, (but not to quite the sale level
    of weirdness) and the underlying structure is much rounder."
