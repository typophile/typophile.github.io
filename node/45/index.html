<div class=commentbody> hehe. exactly. <br>anyway, an actual double "v" looks good, but it was, as I suspected, way to wide. I would have to change the rest of the characters by widening them a couple of pixels to make it look good. I don't know if it's worth it...I'm sure I'll run in to other problems instead. btw, what about the uc "P"? </div>

<div class=commentbody> Thems some good "w"s! <br> <br>Overall, a nice balance of bits and flair. <br> <br>Just one thing: I think your lining numerals could be one pixel taller (or go all the way to the cap height if you follow the suggestion below). You might consider making "hybrid" numerals too - in fact I'd make three sets: hybrid (as the primary form), lining with the caps, and lastly traditional old-style. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> Thanx! (Hrant approval is gooood <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)>) <br> <br>Actually, the lining numerals are one pixel less in height than the cap height... So I guess I could make them cap height. Haven't tried. <br>The old-style is one pixel less than the small caps... Hmmm. (Starting to notice a pattern maybe...) <br> <br>What about this hybrid form? I saw a thread, but it seemed like everyone had suggestions on what to change, and if I took all in account, it would end up either like regular old-style or lining numerals. <br> <br>More questions: <br> <br>1. Being a newbie in (serious) type-design, I was wondering how many characters I should make, I don't really know how they all are supposed to look <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br>(I know the alphabet, of course, and the letters used in swedish, &#229;,&auml;,&ouml;, but I'm having trouble with things like the difference in lenght between en dashes and em dashes and various other characters) <br>So, Is there any standard on how many (and what) characters there should be in a (professional) typeface. <br> <br>2. Distribution. <br>I was thinking of making my bitmap faces (designed mainly for flash use...) available freely. <br>Is this a good/bad idea? <br>I invest quite alot of time in the tiny bitmapped stuff, but it feels like taking money for the typefaces wouldn't work. <br> <br>Planned for this typeface for example is an extensive set of characters, small caps, different numeral sets and italics...oh yeah, and bitmap ornaments! <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:)> <br> <br>Could I make them free for personal and non-profit work, and a fee for commercial use? Is there any foundries accepting submissions of pixel fonts? Help me out here, please! </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>> the lining numerals are one pixel less in height than the cap height <br> <br>! <br>They look so much smaller... Maybe the tall "Z" next to the short zero exagerates the difference. OK, just ignore what I said. :-/ <br> <br>> The old-style is one pixel less than the small caps. <br> <br>That makes sense, since the old-styles are x-height (this time I actually measured to make sure...), and you want smallcaps to be a bit larger. <br> <br>> What about this hybrid form? I saw a thread, but it seemed like everyone had suggestions on what to change <br> <br>I don't remember such suggestions... Anyway, here's the best on-line sample that I know of: <br> <br><a href=http://www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html target=_top>http://www.linesandsplines.com/carter3.html</a> <br> <br>I've become conviced that -overall- the Carter numerals (as I [personally] have now decided to call them) offer the best balance in most situations. <br> <br>In your case I would make the "x-height" of the Carter numerals one pixel smaller than what you currently have for your linings, and extend the traditional old-style choices* by two pixels. <br> <br>* Except maybe make the "2" ascend - possibly by one pixel only. <br> <br>> I was wondering how many characters I should make <br> <br>Start with ASCII-8 (for both platforms). <br> <br>> I don't really know how they all are supposed to look <br> <br>That's of course a major thing in type design. And sometimes designers will agree quite closely on things, other times not at all. And some designers worry a lot about the quality of such "extra" characters, while others just slap them together. <br> <br>Obviously, the more you look at precedents (especially of course reputable ones), the better your results will be - as long as you don't *mimic* anybody - think things through yourself, and apply your conclusions. For example, the en/em issue raises all kinds of opposing opinions, so in that case it's better to simply look at what those characters are supposed to *do* in text, instead of copying some precedent. Another example: many people make the Florin upright, but I've heard that the authentic form is slanted; this type of thing obviously deals with cultural preferences, so it's much harder to get right, as it can't really be "thought through" as much. <br> <br>Then there's this: <br><a href=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm target=_top>http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm</a> <br> <br>> taking money for the typefaces wouldn't work. <br> <br>For bitmap fonts it only works if you have a stellar reputation - like Matthew Bardram. <br> <br>Otherwise, consider doing this: <br>Make outlines, and have two versions of the font: one bitmap-only, the other with both outlines and bitmaps. You give away the former, get people "dependent" on it, and sell the full version. <br> <br>> Could I make them free for personal and non-profit work, and a fee for commercial use? <br> <br>There are various schemes like that, but I think they're generally not flexible enough, and tend to be more complicated than people like. <br> <br>Consider this instead: <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/692.html?1011647082 target=_top>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/692.html?1011647082</a> <br> <br>> Is there any foundries accepting submissions of pixel fonts? <br> <br>Some of them are probably here listening, so wait and see. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody> I'm fond of your small cap set. It's nice and <br>tight--the biggest requirement of bitmaps. <br> <br>Your new Ws are much nicer than the first round. I <br>guess the lesson is don't be afraid of varying <br>widths. <br> <br>Finally, regarding your distribution approach. <br>I'm wondering if it's not a bad idea to <br>distribute the bitmap for free and then sell the <br>outlines.

<div class=commentbody> I'm also quite fond of the small cap set. It worked better than I thought it would. <br>As for the Ws, I guess I got blind working on them before.

People could offer their fonts for licensing - it could even become an alternative to submitting to a font house: font houses would come here to see what's for "sale". <br> <br>Or maybe make it a subsection of the Critique forum: finished faces could get an announcement there, citing the intentions of the designer.
