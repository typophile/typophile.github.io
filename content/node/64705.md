  serif typeface.\r\n\r\nIt used diamond shaped dots.\r\nSemicolon also used diamond
  instead of a dot.\r\nThere was a lot of ligatures used also.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
  that's all I can recall.\r\n\r\nWhich font it might be?\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\n-- \r\nbest

    think it was just custom modified, newer version of Goudy Oldstyle (question marks
    were different).\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nregards,\r\nTom"

  body: "Warnock does have diamond dots. So do the following (a partial list of serifs
    browsed at MyFonts): FB Spira, Centaur, Iowan Old Style, Andralis ND, LTC Deepdene,
    Goudy Oldstyle, LTC Metropolitan, Benicia (Parkinson), Bertham Pro, P22 Mai, LTC
    Hadriano, Caxton, RTF Cotillion and Priori Serif.\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is
    set a sample of type with various glyphs involving dots and then scroll away with
    'serif' as the search term.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
