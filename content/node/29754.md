  body: "This isn't meant to sound harsh, just honest:\r\n\r\nFirst, the logo is in
    need of something a little more elegant if you're specializing in 'upscale weddings.'
    It's trying a little too hard to be the superman S but is failing miserably, to
    put it kindly. I don't think the mason typeface is what you want for the 'productions'
    part of this logo type. It doesn't say 'professional'. It's context is more of
    the demonic use.\r\n\r\nYour tagline starts right under the 'g' and is just awkward
    looking underneath the logo. \r\n\r\nI would give more space between your phone
    number and your website. You might also want to differentiate the two with maybe
    having one as a sans font. I would also set your name in a sans typeface to make
    it stand out so people know who to talk to.\r\n\r\nAnd is it me or did you stretch
    yourself on the picture? It doesn't look stretched by much, but just a little
    bit to throw it off. Maybe it's just the size I'm viewing it at.\r\n\r\nHope this
    helps. Best luck with the redesign."

      fonts and such are all things I am learning about. I was not aware that the
      mason typeface font was used for more demonic purposes LOL...Thanks for pointing
      that out!

  body: "I agree about photos in business cards. The only people I've been forced
    to design a card with a photo for were estate agents. IMHO you should only put
    a photo in if your face is very important for the job, so I would understand a
    model having her/his photo in the card.\r\n\r\nIf you're after upscale weddings,
    the card should look the part."

  body: "Yes, definitely lose the photo, it could be seen as arrogant, and it is robbing
    space from the relevant information.\r\n\r\nI'd bring the phone number in line
    with the job title and website (same type, size, style and right alignment), and
    lose the horizontal rule. \r\n\r\nThe logo could manage without the hyphen, and
    'Productions' would look much more pleasant in letterspaced caps (or letterspaced
    small caps if they are available to you) in the same typeface as the other information.\r\n\r\nWith
    a bit of tweaking you could match the height of the 'G' to the rest of the logo
    and also make the horizontal rule line up perfectly with the serif of the 'G'.\r\n\r\nOnce
    the picture was removed you would have the logo top left and details bottom right,
    with plenty of space (space implies quality), and nice tension across the card.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    could 'Emcee' be unfamiliar terminology to an upscale crowd? MC may be a safer
    choice.\r\n\r\nGood luck with everything\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My advice: hire a real designer.\r\n\r\nYou would never hire a graphic designer
    to DJ a wedding, so why would you (a DJ) design a business card?\r\n\r\nIf you're
    interested in learning more about design, take a look at the \"Critique\" forum
    and see what people say about others' designs. Maybe even get some books on design
    or take a course at your local college. Right now, however, you clearly lack experience
    with this sort of thing (\"what is a sans font\").\r\n\r\nSo, if you need this
    card right away, hire a pro designer. If it can wait, keep posting here for advice
    and suggestions. Good luck :)\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    down to the minimum, then build up the necessary. you'll be left with something

    Campbell (not saying you're ugly) in which case it migh be a good thing for your
    business. Or not. \r\nIn fact, photos in general on business cards are kind of
    weird, not only portraits.\r\nAlso agree about hiring a pro. However, I guess
    it's a cool thing you're trying to figure out how things work sooooo: good luck."
