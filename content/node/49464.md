  look modern, and have been using Eurostile for 6 months... aside for my general
  dislike of eurostile, I', just not very good at using it. just as I'm not very good
  at playing soccer.\r\n\r\nDo you know of corporate/finance sites who use eurostile
  successfully? Think ge.com, but with eutrostile.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nalex"

    not you Alex, it's not you! Eurostile is impossible to set. It always looks baggy
    and lifeless. Like a lank, dated hairdo. I rank it alongside some of the worst
    popular faces. Frankly it's a stinker. Its use should be limited purely to car
    dashboards.\r\n"

    the business your client is in), so they've made an inappropriate choice of font.
    See if you can talk them out of it and into using another, more suitable face.
    Justify your advice with rationale like, \"It makes more sense. A more appropriate
    face will communicate your branding to your customers more effectively. I'm the
    type expert so you should listen to me, or the bunny gets it, mkay?\"\r\n\r\nI
    can't think of a single corporate/finance outfit that makes successful use of
    Eurostile.\r\n\r\nI blame neil Sedaka and his entourage.\r\n\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    care too much about \"what looks good\", it's all about concistency. Of course,
    at the beginning of the project, they told us we were free to \"challenge\" (or
    whatever word they ued) their design guidelines. \r\n\r\nI was armed with 7 powerpoint
    slides explaining what makes eurostile uglier tha FF Netto, but for no use. \r\n\r\nDo
    you have any examples of financial institutions who have made _unsuccessful_ use
    of Eurostile?\r\n\r\nI don't think it's a total stinker. The bold caps are really

  body: I think Eurostile looks bad because it's included on PCs. Obviously that doesn't
    hold true for typefaces like Verdana and Georgia, since not every font is created
    by the likes of Matthew Carter, but anything that's not 100% spot-on and timeless
    is going to get worn out very quickly when it's included on millions of PCs.

    will third the use of Foundry Monoline for text. Call it the text version of Eurostile.
    I first became aware of Foundry Monoline after visiting MoMA:QNS and viewing their
    way-finding program. It was, I though, the best looking use of Eurostile I'd ever
    seen. Turns out it was FM. I couldn't find any decent images of the interior signage
    at MoMA:QNS since it's now closed (it was the temporary home of MoMA). However,
    you can see some of it at the portfolio site of the designers: http://www.twotwelve.com/flash/
    >> Projects >> MoMA QNS >> Images 2&3. FM was used for the QNS Matisse Picasso
    exhibit -- the program used it for text.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n*edit - found

    Eurostyle always looks bad, no matter what the context, while others insist it
    always looks good or is at least an inherently good typeface design.\r\n\r\nIn
    actuality, it all depends on context, yet if the word content / image is sufficiently
    demanding, certain fonts don't measure up, pack it in early, show their lack of
    range and teeth. Microgramma / Eurostile is one such font.\r\n\r\nThe bold version
    is partly redeemed from such embarrassment in much the same way as bold Helvetica
