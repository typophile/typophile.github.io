body: "While I\u2019m still working on the greater releases of the <i>Hikari</i> font
  family and <i>Theory Serif, Sans and Mono</i>, I was crazy enough to begin work
  on a fifth font project. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bot-Mono-Sheet-sml_4651.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  idea was born out of a personal need. For months I have been working in Coda to
  write CSS and HTML code, and I got tired of the array of fonts in the monospaced
  category, some of which come with the system, some I collected over the past couple
  of years. From <i>Menlo</i> (Apple) to <i>Droid Sans</i> (Google), I couldn\u2019t
  find a font that I found was well designed for an on-screen reading experience.
  Designers of monospaced fonts often claim they were thinking about computer displays
  first, but when you look at the results, especially in common sizes ranging from
  10 to 18 points, the letter shapes often look washed up and have sometimes been
  just compressed or extended to fit a space (I\u2019m looking at you, first version
  of <i>Source Code Pro</i>). Bad hinting and unclear shapes result in a nearly unidentifyable
  letter shape and the overall legibility is suffering.\r\nOf course, the very idea
  of a monospaced font is actually against <i>improved legibility</i>, because it
  takes away nearly all options to even out white space and create a harmonic experience.\r\n\r\nWhat
  can be changed though is the individual shape. I think nowhere else it is more crucial
  to get this part right, than with a monospaced typeface designed for screen. We
  have various screen resolutions today, ranging from tiny devices (like wrist watches)
  to an iMac with a 5k Retina Display. For programmers looking at a display for hours,
  the reading experience becomes as much, if not more, relevant than other practical
  considerations when choosing a monospaced font.\r\n\r\nSo this is <i>Bot Mono</i>,
  a very young, fresh project of mine and I hope you will share your thoughts and
  critique with me. There will be a few more changes and a large set of glyphs need
  yet to be worked out, the numbers are missing yet, but it\u2019s already showing
  a lot of its personality and I am curious to hear what you think.\r\n\r\n<i>(Attached
  is a PDF for closer inspection)</i>\r\n\r\n<strong>Questions</strong>\r\n<ul><li>Do
  you think I\u2019m on a good path overall? Do you see major mistakes or things you\u2019d
  change, and why?</li><li>You may have noticed the inconsistency of what Erik Spiekerman
  calls \u201Cthe canon\u201D, the pattern of shapes used for letters such as c, e,
  b and a. Some are closing, some have an open, humanist shape. The idea was partly
  inspired by <i>Roboto</i> and Nick Shinn\u2019s recent release, <i>Neology</i>,
  which I love, by the way. What are your thoughts on this part? Do you think it works
  and doesn't disturb the reading flow?</li></ul>"

    a fan of closed counters, though, and in bigger sizes the mismatched details tends
    to be distracting.\r\n(one pet-peeve of mine is that I like the slashed |0| with
    a backslash, to unambiguously differentiate it from any other glyph)"

    /i and the /r could be just a smidgen wider. Perhaps move the /i a bit to the
    right in its box."

  body: I've been using Source Code Pro for coding websites. Comparing the two, I
    like what I see in Bot Mono. If the counters were opened up a bit on the c, s,
    G, C, etc., though, it might improve legibility at typical 11, 12-pt working sizes.
    Then again, preferences are often the result of what one gets used to.

  body: "To the open/closed counter discussion:\r\n\r\nThe fact some counters are
    closed and some are open is of course not by accident. The idea is to distinguish
    individual glyphs more, without sacrificing overall readability. \r\n\r\nThe thought
    model that readability of a sans serif (or any font) is <em>always</em> improved
    by open counters <em>everywhere</em>, is a bit outdated, if you ask me. Closed
    counters improve readability by forming invisible rails, just like the baseline
    and x-height, or caps height. Open counters are wanted, necessary even, if the
    overall shape becomes muddled (as it would be the case if I kept the lowercase
    \u201Ce\u201D counters closed as I have done it with the \u201Cc\u201D). In the
    case of the lowercase \u201Cc\u201D and \u201Cs\u201D, the shape\u2019s distinctive
    characteristics are emphasized, they would become less distinctive if I kept the
    canon.\r\n\r\nThe current design tries to join the best of both worlds, the closed
    counters-philosophy with open counters where it helps distinction. Keep in mind
    I was designing the font to be used in 12 to 18 point sizes (on regular, modern
    displays). If you keep a distance of a foot or more to the display, anything below
    12 point will look closer to 7 or 8 point on a printed business card. Bot Mono
    is not well suited for large sizes, unless imperfection is part of the message
    you want to express.\r\n\r\nI am truly greatful for all your input. It\u2019s
    great to be pointed to details and think them over. Work is still in progress,
    as this is a young project, but I\u2019m dedicated to finish up by the end of
    the year and release it under an open license, perhaps on Google fonts or Font
    Squirrel. Beta testers are welcome, there will be updates every week now. Just
    send me an email, you\u2019ll find it on http://core-ux.com/contact."
