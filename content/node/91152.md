  body: "The \"Made in Japan\" should be a clue that you may not find a perfect match
    with an extant typeface from a Western foundry. Nonetheless, this is close to
    the SER. NO. face...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trade-gothic/extended/\r\n\r\nAnd
    the stamped numbers are almost certainly not foundry type; however, something
    like Letter Gothic would probably approximate it pretty well."
