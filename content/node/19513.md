  body: My research shows it to be a Garage Font - it is not listed at MY Fonts or
    the Garage Font site but you might try e-mailing Garage Fonts and asking if they
    still sell it. (1994 GarageFonts designed by Rodney Shelden Fehsenfeld )

  body: Hope this doesn't sound disrespectful of the original author's work, but it
    doesn't seem too hard to recreate the look of the font. If you say it's part of
    the company logo, why not redraw the characters needed? It's even a good chance
    to make improvements that are specific of the logo.

    there a way to contact you directly? \r\nYou wrote: 'any previously licensed typefaces
