body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am in need of some serious help with my font. I have already
  designed it, and when I go and and export it into FontLab, everything gets messed
  up. Does anyone know of a company or a freelance typeographer that can help me out?
  MyFonts have already set up an foundry, and I didn't realize it would be this difficult.
  If anyone can lead me in the right direction, that would be great!\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nErin"
