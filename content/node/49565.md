body: "Hello all.\r\nI'm looking to an alternative / similar face to American typewriter.\r\nas
  I like the way it feels handmade and a bit loose.\r\nBut something bothers me about
  the serifs.\r\nBut I don't want anything as stiff as Rockwell but perhaps something
  in between?\r\n\r\nIt needs to ideally be a bit girly\r\n\r\nAny ideas would be
  much appreciated \r\n\r\nCheers \r\n\r\nMr Brown"
