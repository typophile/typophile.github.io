    guidelines which suggest its not a good idea to post a duplicate thread to re-up,
    so I just wondered if anyone had any ideas? \r\n\r\nIf it helps I found the sample
    on and article about Geoff Mcfetridge but i'm not sure if he has created this,
    as I think he mainly works with hand drawn type.\r\n\r\nThanks : )"
