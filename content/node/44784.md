  body: "Hello rdc...\r\n\r\nYou'll get a much better response from Google and the
    information that that brings back for you... This question, or similar has been
    asked far lots of times in these forums, even if we all came back with our opinions,
    thats all they are, opinions. You'll be better off looking into the subject and
    researching it yourself. You'll learn far more too... In all honesty, there's
    nothing better than good 'swiss' books on the subject.\r\n\r\nBest of luck.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nRez\r\n"

    probably a whole shelf of such books. And there are probably several people sitting
    behind a desk just waiting to help you find it."

  body: English is not my native language but if someone calls it "the design grid"
    I think he or she has to elaborate more on what design is (is about). So my opinion
    is <em>pro</em>.
