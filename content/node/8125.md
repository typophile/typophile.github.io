  body: It looks to be painted on to the glass, which means it is most likely custom,
    but I think it looks loosely based on Goudy, perhaps?

  body: I posted this because the church wants additional signage and would like to
    use the same font. They asked me, and when I couldn&#39;t find it, I turned to
    the experts. <BR> <BR>Although the church is over 100 years old, it&#39;s uncertain
    how old the sign is; my guess is at least 50 years old, so if it is a font, it&#39;s
    not anything designed in the last half-century. <BR> <BR>The lettering is not
    painted; it&#39;s more like reverse painted, because when illuminated from behind,
    the letters light up. <BR> <BR>If nobody can identify the font, a suggestion as
    to what&#39;s &#34;close&#34; or at least &#34;compatible&#34; would also be most
    welcome. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the response RN, but I think Goudy is too far off
    the mark. In almost all Goudy fonts, the &#34;J&#34; extends below the baseline.
    <BR> <BR>In addition to the ball terminal on the &#34;J,&#34; the &#34;R&#34;
    is also somewhat distinctive.

  body: That&#39;s why I said loosely based. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>The &#34;R&#34; was what I used for most of my
    search, but overall Goudy seemed like a decently good fit... and that &#34;J&#34;
    looks like it may indeed be a custom addition.  There are a few fonts out there
    that match your &#34;R&#34; better than Goudy&#39;s, but the rest of the fonts
    were so far off that I didn&#39;t bother linking them.

  body: This sign comes out of the sign-painting tradition, not the world of type.
    Although there are cross-influences between the two disiplines &#40;and in fact
    they have completely and sadly merged in the last few decades&#41;, any similarity
    to an existing font with something as old as this seems to be would be a happy
    coincidence. <BR> <BR>Something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort"
    target="_blank">Beaufort</a> would give a similar overall look, even though the
    J and R are different.

  body: Beaufort is really a good match as far as serifs are concerned, but it lacks
    the thick/thin variations of the vertical strokes. <BR> <BR>Anyone think these
    are close? <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/century-expanded/century-exp-ef-regular/testdrive.html">Century

  body: Sorry, I think neither of those is as close as Mark&#39;s suggestion &#40;Beaufort&#41;.  Perhaps
    you are letting the J influence you too much.  Your best chance would be to see
    if you could blend a closer J and R with the right weight of Beaufort. <BR> <BR>The
    fact is that you are looking for something that probably doesn&#39;t exist, as
    Mark explained, so the best you can do is come as close as possible, or pick a
    completely new direction, so that it just doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t look like a
    poor match, but a conscious choice for a different look.
