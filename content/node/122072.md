body: "sirs from typophile\r\nIm writing to this email because I trust that you will
  be able to help me.\r\nI work in the arts and I know that there are few stylised
  fonts\r\n\u2026the aquiline the zapfino\u2026\r\nBut I have come across a film with
  a truly unique and beautiful font, this is why I come to you for help.\r\nI am just
  like you, an arts lover.\r\nWhat Im looking for is seen on the film moliere 2007\r\nIm
  sending you a JPG of the part of the film where I found this font, which Im hoping
  you can help me name. I know the font that comes when they name the actors (aquiline
  two)\r\nbut in the other images, the ones that say paris 1645 and moliere at the
  beginning and at the end of the film. That is the font I need, please tell me what
  the name of it is.\r\nI look forward to your help.\r\na thousand thank you\u2019s
  for your time\r\n\r\nI await your email\r\nliseurolis@gmail.com"
