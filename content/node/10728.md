  body: ' Like I alluded to in another thread, I think you need to get into grayscale
    bitmap fonts to really achieve the type of thing that seems to turn you on. The
    level of detail you&#39;re trying to put in such limited space might be requiring
    too much wishful thinking at the expense of real legibility. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: hey hrant, <BR> <BR>i tried out bitfonter, and, well, they problem with grayscale
    bitmap fonts are a plenty <BR> <BR>1&#41; they don&#39;t work with photoshop,
    at least on a mac <BR> <BR>2&#41; they are gray, not semi-transparent, so you
    can only use white backgrounds <BR> <BR>they do work on the mac though...

    to do with the Windows OS directly&#41;. But the transparency stuff you&#39;re
    supposed to be able to do with something they&#39;re calling Photofonts. <BR>
    <BR>Anyway, what I&#39;ve done is send my files to them, with a detailed explanation
    of what&#39;s not working. I&#39;m hopeful, because Pyrus&#39;s responsiveness
    in terms of features/bugs is legendary. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    the web there is a weird program that embeds images in type called photofonts,

    do photoshop with it, that would be half the battle, but then you couldn&#39;t
    use it with Flash &#40;Flash doesn&#39;t &#42;do&#42; bitmap fonts&#41; '
