  body: First you should have checked your [[http://typophile.com/node/107698|previous
    request]] as I had already identified the one for the date and time. It's [[http://arstype.angusrshamal.com/a-new-free-font-ars-novelty|ARS
    Novelty]] by Angus R. Shamal. Still wondering what's the one for "MARKET SQUARE"
    though...
