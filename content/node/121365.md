  found this sans serif on dafont.com that I really love: [[http://www.dafont.com/bn-pinky.font]]
  Although it is free to use, the TTF  files themselves appear to be restricted for
  conversion, which means I cannot use them for my website as I had hoped. \r\n\r\nI
  was wondering if any of you respected expected might be able to suggest a typeface
  that is similar in feel to BN Pinky?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bn_pinky_6048.png]\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance!"
