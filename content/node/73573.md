  question is one I used a while ago in the design on my wife\u2019s web site; however
  the completion got delayed for a while and I had saved all the banners as images.
  When I returned to complete web site I had not made a note of the font I used on
  the title banners. I want to make a few changes but need the name of the font I
  used otherwise I will have to change all the banners; and to be truthful I like
  the font. So can anybody Please help, I will be forever in your debt. Cheers.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sympathybanner_5871.jpg]"
