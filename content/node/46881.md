  is James Gabour, 96, who still goes every day to his printing plant in Pineville,
  Louisiana. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/linotype-territory-map_3826.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor
  a while he was the local Linotype sales and service rep, his region around here
  was quite large.\r\n\r\nJames' son, Jim Gabour, Artist in Residence and Professor
  of Video Technology, Loyola University New Orleans told me about his dad and we
  have been corresponding about him ever since.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the text from
  some of that correspondence while setting up my appointment to take James oral history:\r\n\r\n\"Sent:

  Nancy.\r\n \r\nDad loves the attention.  The Smithsonian was talking to him about
  a print museum a couple of years back, right before Bush destroyed their funding.
  \ We have been trying to get him to safeguard this huge amount of material for years.
  \ Maybe your attention will make him value them more.\r\n \r\nMy first interview
  was just to get him to demo the operation and function of all the machines, graphic
  and type formats before they decayed or that old place burns down.  Later this summer
  i am going to talk to him more on-camera about history.  \r\n \r\nHe has a lot of
  that:\r\n \r\nhe was heavily into Indian motorcycles\r\n \r\nhe was a mess sergeant
  in the army, stationed in panama during WWII\r\n \r\nhe went to linotype school
  in brooklyn for a year or so, then more study in Chicago\r\n \r\nhe was shop steward
  for the printer's union at the daily where he and my mom met (she was a cub reporter),
  and when the national union called a strike and the daily replaced everybody with
  scabs he started up a rival daily that lasted a couple of years\r\n \r\nhis linotype
  territory include northern Mexico\r\n \r\nWhen he and Mom got those weekly papers,
  as the eldest i worked three minimum ten-hour days a week after school from age
  8 until i left for university at 18 on a press association scholarship.  We started
  typesetting MON, laid out ads and pages TUE, and worked until midnight or later
  WED with the press run and printing and affixing mailing labels.\r\n \r\nIt was
  a good experience, and i watched him make it work\r\n\r\njg\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nSent:

  i ride my bike to the gym today i will try and shoot a few pix of the linotype bldg
  and send them along.  i  will send them to Dad too, as he remembers working in the
  bldg well\r\n \r\nfunny, every time i hold one of those 108-point wood letters in
  my hand i think of the human energy invested in its existence.  and the metal 2-point
  no less\r\n \r\ndid you see that odd \"machine\" for hand-setting type on the diagonal?
  \ pretty cool.  i forget what he called it, but i don't remember it being there
  in my decade of residence as a child.  he has continued picking up odd bits of print
  shops that have gone under over the years, and even though he no longer uses them
  he keeps them in shape and treasures them\r\n\r\njg\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nTo: nancy sharon

  bldg stood until very recently, at the corner of Union & Baronne -- i went to a
  few great art-opening parties in its new lobby prior to the storm, and it was a
  wonderful space.  must have taken a Katrina hit, like many others\r\n \r\nas you
  can see, when they tore it down they painted where it adjoined the other buildings\r\n

    so lost the thread.  Umm, what did I miss?  Where did the mean old W and entitlement
    aspect come into my original blog, I would love to know (with my head so much
    into history maybe I miss the current connections.)\r\n\r\nSunday I found out
    that James Gabour has every catalog, manual and written record from his time as
    a Monotype rep.  I captured about an hour of video on him this go 'round.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for allowing history to be inspiring."

  body: "Sorry Nancy... the mean ole W remark was a gut reaction to the propensity
    for piling on Bush when in fact I think it was gutless politicians who probably
    slashed the bill fearing for their political lives. Don't know and willing to
    be corrected. As to the funding I think since it was a private concern it should
    be kept from under the thumb of the \"guberment\" as they usually muck up the
    works. Hence my willingness to contribute to the cause. As to the public versus
    the private I think the line has been blurred for so long that those concerned
    with a particular facet of our heritage should belly up to the bar and forget
    the bureaucrats.\r\n\r\nJust trying to help, tell me what I can do.\r\n\r\nMichael "

    this initiative.\r\n\r\n2. Prior to this I was just made Special Projects Director,
    AIGA New Orleans.  Most of my efforts will go towards the \"History of Graphic
    Design in South Louisiana Project\". AIGA is all volunteer and the local chapter
    is supported only by its members (about 40 professional) so our pockets are quite
    shallow.\r\n\r\nhttp://neworleans.aiga.org/home/history_project_1\r\n\r\nDo you
    think that if I asked for donations for a designated fund anyone would help?  We
    need operating expenses and storage (translate: gas money to take oral histories
    and hard drive space and physical storage space.)\r\n\r\n3. Follow my line of
    reasoning as I draft the long form of the article I am working on, \"New Orleans
    Green Salon 2008\" for the Seattle Journal for Social Justice.  (I have copied
    and pasted the abstract below:)\r\n\r\n2008 New Orleans Green Salon\r\n\r\nNancy
    Sharon Collins and Daniela Marx\r\nLoyola University New Orleans\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThroughout
    North America, AIGA Center for Sustainable Design (CFSD) uses \u201Cgreen salons\u201D
    to promote sustainable practices in design.  In March 2008, Loyola University
    New Orleans hosted a Salon.  In a city traditionally filled with creative vitality,
    what could sustainable currently mean when New Orleanians were still being consumed
    by efforts to stabilize communities, careers and individual lives? Quoting from
    the original notes and video footage taken during the New Orleans Salon, this
    article chronicles events, expert opinions and artistic insights as well as anecdotal
    community and individual concerns.  By examining the text of this one-day event
    this article shows the tenuous relationship between academia, community, business
    and the arts in a city still challenged by the aftermath of great disaster.\r\n\r\nhttp://sustainability.aiga.org/discussion/2008/03/bright_mississi.cfm\r\n\r\nhttp://neworleans.aiga.org/events/2008/03/17421097\r\n\r\n"
