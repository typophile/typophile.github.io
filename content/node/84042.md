  webfont kit generator.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/droid-sans_4634.png]\r\n<code></code>\r\n\r\nIf
  I understand correctly, latter is .woff, <em>but</em> if I change @font-face statement
  to reference .ttf only, I am still getting the same appearance. Moreover, Google
  Fonts serves .woff as well and it looks like the top version. The same goes for
  WebType.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts as to why this could be happening?\r\n\r\n"
