  body: "Being Verdana so neutral (not in design per se, but at least because it's
    everywhere), almost any typeface could go with it.\r\nSo your choice will depend
    more on the content of the website and the meaning of the logo.\r\nIn fact, usually
    the complimentary typeface is the last thing you choose."
