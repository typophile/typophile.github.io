		<div class="commentbody">BJ &ndash; <BR> <BR>1) As JFP mentioned, there was a catalog published in conjunction with the traveling exhibit of Matthew Carter's work, <i>Typographically Speaking: The Art of Matthew Carter</i>. This included a complete checklist (well, complete as of last year &ndash; it doesn't include the most recent designs, like the Monticello revival). The checklist was compiled by Carter himself. <BR> <BR>John Berry wrote an article about the exhibit, which you can read at <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/18099.html" target="_blank"> <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/18099.html">http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/18099.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>The catalog may still be available. You can try contacting Cynthia Wayne, Curator of Exhibitions at the Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery &ndash; e-mail: <a href="mailto:cwayne@umbc.edu"><a href="mailto:cwayne@umbc.edu">cwayne@umbc.edu</a></a> or telephone (410) 455-2270. I think the cost is $20 + $3 S&amp;H. <BR> <BR>The checklist lists 72 designs, including the ITC Greeks.

		<div class="commentbody">Matthew mentions in his introduction that he doesn't include several faces that have been attributed to him but that he doesn't consider that he really designed &ndash; including things like Auriol and Cochin and Optima Greek. But they show up in the index that I counted earlier. Go figure. <BR> <BR>He also omitted a couple designs that he did for corporate identities (such as the one I think you are calling Airport in your list) because they were never manufactured as fonts for typesetting, but instead only pasted up from photostats &ndash; so he says. <BR> <BR>I see no mention of Century 725. Elephant was renamed Big Figgins for general release. He says New Baskerville is wrongly attributed to him; John Quaranta directed that one. The <i>Washington Post</i> Bodoni is called Postoni (no 'd'). He doesn't mention Rocky.  <BR> <BR>He did Ionic Number One in 1999 for Carter &amp; Cone. You're missing Wrigley for <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. He also includes the Manutius Latin supplement to Miller that he did for UCLA. There was Benton Bold Condensed for <i>Time</i>, Foreman Light for <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, and Newsbaum for the New York <i>Daily News</i>. <BR> <BR>It is now clear to me that the index I counted earlier is not a definitive list &ndash; it's just an index; and several entries are faces that he doesn't claim. So that 72 count I mentioned earlier is incorrect. I don't have the time to assemble a more definitive list from the 16-page specimen. <BR> <BR>But get the book. It's well worth it. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">bj <BR> <BR>I sent a post previously but it hasn't shown up. Probably hit the wrong button. <BR> <BR>One item you are missing is LeBe, a Hebrew that was used in the Pennyroyal Caxton Bible. Not available otherwise. There are also beta fonts that have been around for a while that have not appeared and probably won't until there is some commercial interest.  <BR> <BR>I was involved in the Manutius face mentioned by Kent. At the time Miller Text and Wilson Greek were in beta and we needed a roman/Greek face. Matthew configured them for us and also supplied every glyph we could find that existed in the 16th, 17th, and 20th century. It grew to be quite a monster. It is no longer available. I wrote about the project in an issue of Printing History. The beta fonts I mentioned above were also discussed in the article. Not sure how Matthew felt about that so I will only refer you to the article. <BR> <BR>Skia was initially a QuickDraw GX font and had much more extrapolative potential (amazingly so) than what was eventually made available as a TrueType font. Might want to somehow deferentiate this?</div>

Carter offered some basic help with the project &amp; has seen it, but not commented. At least he didn&rsquo;t suggest I&rsquo;d done it harm (he&rsquo;s a nice man).</p>
<p>I was unaware Wilson Greek is no longer available; that is a shame. They took out some of the Greek text in the final version, but I used it with Quadraat for <cite>Household and City Organization at Olynthus</cite>.</p>
