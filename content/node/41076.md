  that word up) and ran across this site: http://shopmanifestopress.com/20foca.html\r\n\r\nI'm
  talking specifically about the one around the \"Manifesto\" logo and the ones used
  on the actual calenders. I was wondering if someone knew where to get flourishes
  and ornaments like these?? not necessarily these, but like these.\r\n\r\nGRACIAS!"
