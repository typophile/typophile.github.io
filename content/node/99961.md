    not Baroque, and Georgia is basically Neoclassical.\r\n\r\nCaslon is Baroque.
    For more Baroque types, look at the Dutch 18th Century types of Fleischmann and
    Rosart.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Baskerville, Neoclassical types include Bulmer and
    Bell, and I'd be inclined to put Georgia in this category too. Walbaum is on the
    line between Neoclassical and Romantic, although most people class it with the
    latter.\r\n\r\nBodoni's types are Romantic. Century and Clarendon are better described
    as Victorian, I think, along with the varieties of Scotch Roman, but of course
    these come out of the Romantic tradition. Since you're including modern types
    in the various styles as well as originals of the period, e.g. Arno as renaissance,
    you could include Kepler among the Romantic types.\r\n\r\nThis has the look of
    a school project.\r\n\r\n"

    suggestion of Kis for the Baroque category, though.\r\n\r\nJannon's types are

    early? At least for me.\r\n\r\nWhat I actually tried to do initially is figure
    out Justin's framework for including Archer in there, so I could follow that.
    I couldn't. So I figured to ask: what kind of typeface goes beyond all the ones
    Modernism uses? I don't think that's only things like Univers. But I'm not sure
    I made sense either - especially since Bloemsma for example actually considered

    try to avoid postmodernism as a category, in part because it is by its own nature
    fragmented and without clear edges, but I can imagine classing Archer in this
    way because of its interpretative stance to 19th Century slab serifs. But then
    one would have to put virtually all recent fonts with any historical reference
    into the same grabbag.\r\n\r\nI think Evert Bloemsma was very much a modernist,
    of a particular kind (my favourite, nonconformist kind), in his interest in functional
    methodology and lack of satisfaction with any merely stylistic innovation. While
    some modernists rejected serifs because they didn't correspond to a 'modern style',
    Evert worried about serifs and wanted to know why they might be there and how
    they might function (leading ultimately to FF Avance)."

  body: "<em>something Modernism is too superficial to grasp</em>\r\n\r\nI think your
    grasp of modernism is too superficial. Modernism is a large and complex matrix
    of cultural phenomena, some of them apparently at odds with each other in every
    respect except a sense of being responses to modernity. Modernism manages to encompass
    both critical engagement and ideological prejudice, and everything from the most
    formally gridded layout of high international style to the almost painfully disfocused
    paintings of my beloved David Jones (<a href=\"http://www.allartnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/David-Jones-1895-1974-Mehefin-1949.jpg\">now
    <em>there's</em> uncertainty</a>).\r\n\r\nPostmodernism can also also, of course,
    be read as a response to modernity, although characterised by a contrary stance,
    be it irony, decadence or reaction, and in that most perfect of postmodern phenomenon,
    the Taliban."

    describes pretty well said Taliban, whom I classify as postmodernist because they
    pursue a filtered engagement with the past to produce a new reality that never
    existed in that past.\r\n\r\nYour definition of modernism simply doesn't hold
    with the range of phenomena to which that term is normally applied. So in what
    way does this enable talking practically about anything? Have you not noticed
    that in all these years you've never managed to have a successful conversation
    with anyone on the subject of modernism? All you've ever achieved is exactly this
    kind of wrangle over terminology. The actual phenomena of modernism always escape
    your discussions. \r\n\r\nIt's not as if we're a million miles apart in terms
    of criticism of particular modes of modernism, of particular phenomenon within
    modernism. If you want to say 'There are kinds of modernism that evidence an obsession
    with control and with uncritical certainty', I'll agree wholeheartedly. But there
    are also kinds of modernism that are cautious, nonconformist, analytical and even
    defensive of the past.\r\n\r\nI am far from being a modernist, but further still
    from being a postmodernist. As I said, the stances of postmodernism to the past
    are all in varying ways contrary. At its best, postmodernism proceeds from an
    honest appraisal of the difficulty of having any kind of sympathetic relationship
    to history, but all to often it sinks into ironical poses, and mere stylistic
    cherrypicking."

    politics generally focus on maintaining existing power structures or providing
    (pseudo)historical justifications for new power structures, which actually involves
    disengagement from the past insofar as such politics discourage questioning of
    how the existing power structures came about, what alternatives existed in the
    past, what kind of opposition existed, etc.. Hence the etymology of the word 'radical',
    in questioning the roots of existing structures.\r\n\r\nReactionaries are perfectly
    capable of being postmodernist, as the Taliban demonstrate, although they generally
    don't recognise and certainly don't acknowledge their postmodernism. To construct
    a fantasy of a past that you intend to 'restore' is not to be defensive of the
    past.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nHrant: <em>Maybe they're too defensive?</em>\r\n\r\nMaybe
    they've been brainwashed by shape-shifting lizards. But, really, what is more
    likely?\r\n\r\nYou pick up a term that has common usages and refers to a complex
    set of phenomena, and you redefine it for yourself to mean something incredibly
    blunt and simplistic, in a way that really only permits agreement or disagreement,
    and then you accuse other people of being defensive when rather than agreeing
    or disagreeing they question your appropriation of the term in this way. The irony,
    of course, is that your use of the term modernism in this way is itself over-certain
    and controlling, disallowing nuance and the uncertainty that must allow the possibility
    that you are wrong."

    That's why I find the postmodern classification mostly unhelpful except for a
    handful of works, such as Makela's Dead History, whose association with postmodernism
    is explicit in the intent of the designers. Intentionality plays a bigger role
    in postmodernism than in most previous cultural movements, which can be identified
    by stylistic characteristics; this is why there tended to be a strong conceptual

    in Afghanistan, but it has nothing to do with the Taliban: it subsists at the
    local level, in complex social relationships of tribe, clan and family. The organisation
    of the Taliban, by contrast, is that of a modern militant revolutionary movement.
    I call the Taliban postmodern because they construct a filtered fantasy of the

    postmodern for the same reason; they don't like it either.\r\n\r\nOn the origins
