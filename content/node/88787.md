  body: "Hi C! Short answer to your questions is ... yes... all three :)\r\n\r\nWayyyy
    back in '05 I started a fresh means of using letter shapes within a canvas's area.
    \ To me I call it 'letter chop'. The hallmark of this typographic technique is
    to continue the chopped letter's shape onto the next line below as you would with
    a hyphened word. But, I think the chopped letter shape has a more dynamic (and
    somewhat brutal) presentation and to me the energy of the word (I've since go
    on to use symbols*)  flows without abruption. It probably done before but I haven't
    seen it anywheres. So, it is my hope to contribute to the vastness of using letter
    shapes as a visual expression upon traditional mediums. \r\nJasper Johns, Edward
    Ruscha, Robert Indiana and Corita Kent are my main typographic influences (also
    Jean-Michel Basquiat and Cy Twombly are the bomb).\r\n\r\nWithout looking around
    all that strenuously I've seen my technique copied twice, once in some German
    gallery in '08 and again in a London gallery in '10. \r\n\r\nSorry to have missed
    your post.\r\n\r\n* http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvcthzhE601r1po6ho1_r1_1280.jpg\r\n\r\nn."

    book published June 2010\r\n\r\n\r\nn. "
