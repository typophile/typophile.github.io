  liagature/swash drawing from the [[http://www.typophile.com/battle04?page=1|old
  Type Battle]]. \r\n\r\nI thought it could be interesting to make an otf of alt characters
  that you could just go through cooper black stuff and swap in swashy contextual
  alternates. A companion font, building on something good; updating rather than recreating.\r\n\r\nIt
  would be only new, original glyphs. There would be no ascii characters, only OT
  alts, and no original Cooper Black characters. \r\n\r\nI see potential legal problems.
  What about releasing it free (maybe a creative commons license)? How about naming?\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAaron.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/doodle_sticky_5740.jpg]"

  body: "At least in Europe, the design of Cooper Black is copyright free. I'm not
    sure about NY, but probably knockoffs like \"Cupertino\" (bundled with Corel Draw
    3 [in words: three]) were available and legal there, too.\r\n\r\nIANAL, but AFAIK
    there will be trouble only if you use the actual name (Trademark) or some of the
    mathematical curve descriptions of an existing C B version. You could even add
    the ASCII characters if you traced them yourself.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

    Black Swash Italic]] apparently based on Cooper's original designs. \r\nI'd put
    standard alphabetic glyphs in too."

  body: "@Fontgrube thanks, that is a good point. I should look into rights in the
    states. Still a bit wary of including all of the characters, though it would be
    clearly more useful to do that.\r\n\r\n@Bendy good call, I think the swashes I'd
    do would be more extensive, but it would be good to avoid duplicating this work.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAaron."
