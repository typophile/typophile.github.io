body: 'How do. Is it current practise or even possible within foundries to somehow
  embed a label within font data? For example, a foundry sell a font to a company,
  and embed an i.d number inside so that, should it become circulated illegaly, they''d
  know who let it loose? '

  body: "Yes. There are a million fields in the type info: Copyright notice, Info,
    etc. Different fields are used by different formats, and maybe someone can clear
    up which go with which.\r\n\r\nBut, you can put your client's name somewhere in
    the copyright notice field, as Font Bureau did (still does?). It would require
    either generating fresh fonts for every client, or decompiling and recompiling
    (using TTX for example) the fonts with the new info inside.\r\n\r\nNote that if
    you can add this info, your client or a pirate - if they know the tag is there,
    and are looking to cover their tracks - can remove the tag using TTX or importing,
    tweaking, and generating the font using a font creation software such as FontLab."

  body: Thanks Chester. I guess if someone is hell-bent on stealing, then there is
    ultimately little you can do about it. This can help keep track of things though.
    Theoretically, you could run a python script that would make the regeneration
    a lot less hassle.

  body: "To avoid running afoul of privacy laws you might want to consider serializing
    the fonts, and associating the serial number with the identifiable information
    in a secure off-line database. You could then stockpile some fonts ahead of time.\r\n\r\nCheers,
