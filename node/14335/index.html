  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys, my name is Reddy. I think I really need your opinion about typography goes to curriculum or not? I read Allan Haley article where he says that it doesn’t have to be taught because most of them is just a combination between common sense, attention to detail and visual acuity. At school, we learn about rules and guidelines. Where, actually it’s all about common senses. Can reader read it properly without read a same line twice and is it easy to read?  So what we really need to be taught at school?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Unfortunately common sense can be rather subjective. Rules and guidelines provide an objective framework that can then be adhered to or disregarded when appropriate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Common sense&rsquo; can be also be taken for granted by those who are already familiar with those rules and guidelines, which might lead to some people being dismissive of teaching the basics. I would suggest that the teaching of some basic principles of typography would lead to qualities such as attention to detail and visual acuity, and ultimately an ingrained common sense.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Reddy,</p>
<p>Everyone who can read uses type, all day long, every day. It doesn&rsquo;t require special training. But designers arrange the type, design books, signs, magazines, packages, and if they do it badly, everyone has to suffer. So the designer needs to know more than the &ldquo;man on the street&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just a stuffy old expression: Learn the rules so you can break them well. More specifically, learn how type works, so you can do things with it that are effective and useful, and answer the need to communicate. How does a designer learn about contrast, spacing, size, hierarchy. etc. without at least some basic instruction? Evidence is everywhere that they don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;common sense&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Reddy, look online for an article by Jan Conradi about Slow Typography. She is an advocate of improving typographic education in general design programs.</p>

<p>Sorry, I assumed she would have posted this by now. It appeared in the latest Interrobang, which was handed out at TypeCon, though I realize everyone couldn&rsquo;t attend. I&rsquo;ll look into ways I could post or share it. Maybe Jan will e-mail it. Stay tuned.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Learning typography is far more than &ldquo;The Rules&rdquo; of typography.  Rules come about because of past problems.  We cannot assume that we can create rules to encompass all possibilities or eliminate future problems.  We have to learn to &ldquo;see&rdquo; typographically.  Rules for book design apply differently to ads and covers.  There is no sure passage to good typography.  Like anything else, it takes work.  Part of the work is getting a good sound basis in design school.  The rest comes from a combination of job experience and interaction with colleagues in the profession.</p>
