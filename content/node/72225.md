  body: "I have read the two reviews. I wonder why they appear rather narrow-minded
    to me.\r\n\r\n<cite>Ha ha ha!</cite>\r\n\r\nWait. \r\nMaybe you\u2019ll cease
    laughing about it quite soon.\r\n\r\nNo point in comparing this new app with FontLab
    or Illustrator. No reason to delete it after only one font has been made (as Brian
    Hudson suggests).\r\nThe iPad does not only look like the good old slate, it *is*
    a slate as a matter of fact \u2013 the more so with this new application.\r\n\r\nYou
    may laugh on it because it seems to come as a kind of childish toy-tool of little
    professional value. But hey! It breaks fonting down to writing. Radically. In
    my opinion this is a very serious thing.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Steinach_1_5876.JPG]"

  body: ':) Yeah, these are more fun then serious. I also think direct manipulation,
    as opposed to indirect manipulation with a mouse, is a very interesting concept.
    I just tried Freeform and it''s pretty bad. A lot of essentials is missing, most
    noticable, the lack of a shift button to keep bezier handles at 90 degrees and
    move nodes along an axis and no way to select multiple nodes in a shape. I can''t
    find a way to add nodes neither. I might write a review if I find the time. '

    It allows users to draw big letters on screen one by one and instantly digitizes
    them. That\u2019s not writing, it\u2019s just the same autotracing/autospacing
    people already use to make bad handwriting fonts. "

  body: "Been playing around with this app for a couple of weeks now and it is REALLY
    fun. Im not saying it's \"there yet\" or even professional, but who cares. We
    are all here because we love type and this is an easy and mobile way to play with
    it. Even better if you have interesting handwriting or various handwriting styles.
    Anyway, i would highly recommend \u2013 best 3/4 bucks i've spent. "
