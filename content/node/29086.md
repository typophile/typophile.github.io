body: "One of the things that motivates me in designing type is the shortage of highly
  decorative faces with support for more than just the basic character sets. As a
  visual artist in the online age, I need type that is capable of dispaying european
  words and international locales.\r\n\r\nI am preparing commercial versions of some
  of my fonts, and some new ones. What point would one feel safe saying their fonts
  are \"international\"? Does that bring an expectation of certain sets? If that implies
  non-latin based characters, is there anonther term for fonts with all the major
  accents? Is there a particular shortage of decorative faces in any particular writing
  systems? I am referring particularly to those areas that would support commercial
  fonts.\r\n\r\nRelated to the above, are there other places to market fonts that
  feature internationalization, like a vendor with market dominence in the non-latin
  business? Or do people shop for such at the same sites? Is there anything like myfonts.com
  with multiple languages in its store, and a global appeal?"

  body: In my opinion international does imply more than Latin, but even for Latin
    getting the diacritics and special characters right is not an easy task, designers
    have to rely on trusted language experts and on-line resources (eg. diacritics
    project or the Twardoch files) to get forms acceptable to local designers. As
    a non-native designer once you go beyond Latin things get even more difficult
    to get right for the local users. That's not to say someone who grew up using
    the Latin script can't do a good Greek, Cyrillic or Thai, it just means its more
    difficult and you have to do more homework, and likely pay for expert review.
