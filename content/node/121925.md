  'Dominion' is from? Here it is here\u2014\r\n\r\nhttp://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic539037.jpg\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I don't need it in 2-tone Blue, or even in 3D. Just need the name of the font that
  ONLY the 'D' comes from! \u2014Thanks, if you can help!\r\n\r\nBTW, the OTHER letters
  in the Dominion Logo for OUR purposes have been solved. 'Chaz Bold' seems to be
  as close (and it's pretty dang close) to ALL OTHER LETTERS in the font name OTHER
  than the 'D' or the 'O's'. I recreated the O's in Illustrator. That task was simple
  enough.\r\n\r\nSo, just need to find out what font the 'D' comes from!\r\n"
