    looks like Benton Sans Medium http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/benton-sans/
    except for the crotch of the narrowed M. If I recall correctly Benton Sans was
    originally designed for Martha Stewart for exclusive use for several years before
    being offered to the genral public. Perhaps it was edited for the label logo?\r\nDon"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FFDINProCondMed_3434.jpg] For the second
    row, here is FF DIN Pro Condensed Medium http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/
    The closest I can find, but the M is modified to sharpen the crotch to harmonize
    with the M in MARTHA.\r\nDon"

    the bold weight. To my eye the logo seems to be a closer to the bold than the
    medium weight.\r\nDon"
