  Does anyone recognise this?\r\n\r\nThe film was released in about 1970, I was sure
  it was an old Letraset font, but I can't find it anywhere.\r\n\r\nAny help gratefully
  received, thanks."

  body: I'm not sure this logo appeared until the SE DVDs (late 90s-early 2000). I
    have a coffee table book of Bond posters and I think the original posters had
    logos quite different. Just trying to help the detective process, it's a beautiful
    font.

    this typeface is called Bellery Elongated, haven't found anything online with
    that name though.

    body: Thanks for that. I think the lack of online reference shows that its a face
      not commercially available. Maybe it was designed by Bellery-Desfontaines the
      French artist?
