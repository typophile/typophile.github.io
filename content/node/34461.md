  <a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/2651\"><cite>Power Grid</cite></a>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Power
  Grid_4729.png]\r\n\r\nI've found a few that are fairly close, including <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/liquorstore/\">Liquor
  Store</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/refrigerator/\">Refrigerator</a>,
  <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/flim/\">Flim</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/nicotine/\">Nicotine</a>,
  but I'd like to find an exact match if one exists. I haven't found anything that
  has that distinctive <cite>X</cite>.\r\n\r\nApologies for the poor scan; the actual
  type is very clean and not distressed in the least. If it helps, there are some
  more examples in <a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/images/game/2651?tag=Components\">this
  photo gallery</a>. <a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/147429\">Here</a>'s
  an image that features the full set of numerals."

  body: Is it conceivable that this was custom designed for the game? I've done a
    lot of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/306099757/">research into the
    digital fonts of this genre</a> and never seen this one before.

  body: "Thanks for your informed reply, Stephen. There's a chance this is custom,
    although from what I've seen, there isn't much precedent for using custom fonts
    in eurogames. I don't think they typically sell well enough to justify the cost
    of commissioning a custom design; in fact, I often see them using free or very
    cheap fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm still holding out hope that there is an exact match that
    is commercially available somewhere. If it turns out that there isn't, I would
    very much appreciate a pointer to the closest alternative."

  body: "After I started this thread, I decided to look up and write the person who
    did the art for the game, Maura Kalusky. This morning, I got a reply!\r\n\r\nIt
    turns out that the typeface is called Russka, and it was designed by none other
    than his girlfriend. (Maura Kalusky is male.) It's actually one of two fonts of
    hers that are used in the <cite>Power Grid</cite> design; the other one is called
    Waldmeister, and it's used for some of the text elements on the game box.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to Mr. Kalusky, Russka \"should have some kind of silkscreen aesthetics\", while
    Waldmeister \"looks like printing with rubber stamps\". Both fonts are available
    for purchase through him for \u20AC50 each."
