Says tree farmers not broad enough. Version 3. I like the graphic, much more broad based and growing. Loose American Typewriter. Version 4. You were uninspired, don&#39;t even show these. Version 5. I like the abstract A treatment with the Initial cap treatment. Nice start!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First of all i have to say that there was almost no brief at all. There is nobody who has clear in the mind what exactely they want, so i tried to give a variety of choices, from the very stereotypical and bold &#40;as #5&#41; to a more friendly and playfull logo &#40;#1A and the logo i send now&#41;. I also wrote a text under each case explaining them the messages every logo express so then they can make a decision on which way they want to go. <BR> <BR>For the moment i would go to 1 and 3.  <BR> <BR>Ivan: for #3 i can&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong and if you have an idea to &#34;cure&#34; the balance please tell me so.  <BR> <BR>Daniel: I agree that loose kerning of typewriter would give a more &#34;press&#34; look.  <BR> <BR>Darrel: i tried to make the tree more descriptive but i was loosing the eye. <BR> <BR>I will send any progress but first i have to wait the feedback from the client. <BR> <BR>Thank you all for the quick and helpfull response. <BR> <BR>christos <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47619.gif" alt="logo2"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#34; I think he could get away with any sterotypical cliche&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been to several agribusiness trade shows. The amount of cliche identities in this industry seems to exceed the norm. If you go to one, look down the aisle. You&#39;ll see row upon row of yellow/green logos with either cows &#40;if it&#39;s livestock based&#41; or fields &#40;if crop based&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I agree...one shouldn&#39;t overthink a logo, as the logo isn&#39;t THE important item. But, if you have the chance now to veer a bit from the predictable, you&#39;ll be thankful later on. <BR> <BR>As for the eye logo, I&#39;d drop the tree. Tree doesn&#39;t really say agriculture to me. That says more forestry.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can see strengths in all of these.  <BR> <BR>1a seems very CBS and maybe not very friendly, but I saw the <BR> eye and the tree straight away. I actually really like 1B with all  <BR>caps more than the all lowercase. The all caps seem to support  <BR>the logo more. Besides, it isn&#39;t as if that is the only way it will be  <BR>used. 5a and 5b are very sturdy, very nice incorporation of the  <BR>fields. 4a and 4b are probably a little too organic, not quite  <BR>complete somehow. 3a and 3b are very strong. I actually like the  <BR>use of American Typewriter, it sort of hints at news via  <BR>typewriters. But I suppose Myriad is stronger and safer. 2a is  <BR>nice but the door doesn&#39;t say as much as the eye does. <BR> <BR>My vote is for 1b &#40;top&#41; ... having an eye on something can also <BR>hint at having your finger on the pulse of something ... ergo <BR>you really know what is going on in your corner of the market.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eye is very &#34;big brother&#34; and scary like Tiffany said. Alot of farmers probably wouldn&#39;t like the idea of some strange agricultural news website &#34;looking&#34; over their shoulder. The eye seems nozy. The logo should probably have a growth metaphor condidering that is what farmers do, grow things, so their bank accounts will grow, and so other people will eat what they grow, and then those people will grow from the nutritional value of what has been grown. A lifecycle metaphor might also be nice. Or a food chain sort of thing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all people for your critic. <BR> <BR>I was really worring if the eye was clear enough and felt happy to know that most of you can recognize it. It is true that now i look over 1A reminds of CBS but this logo is almost unknown in Greece &#40;especially to farmers&#41; so there is no feeling about it. I liked David&#39;s idea with the food chain because it would also show the economical dimension of the process but i think it would be really difficult to keep boldness and simplicity illustrating  such a story. To be honest i liked more the 1A both as shape and typography. <BR> <BR>But the decision has been made. The client chose #5 -because he was feeling safe with it- even that he liked more #1. Actually i was expecting this. I know that maybe is one of the most boring logos i ever designed but its success or failure will be proved by the time. <BR> <BR>Thank you all again, have a nice day <BR> <BR>christos</div>
