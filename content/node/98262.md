  body: "The letterforms of these numerals are similar to those in Clarendon, but
    this is a very light display version which I could not find in my books. It also
    resembles the numerals from Torino, which is a sort of condensed Didone style,
    so these are two very different directions in which to look.\r\n\r\nFrom 1957
    means this is pre-digital, and whether something like this was ever digitized
    is a hard guess to make. I have some Photo-Lettering catalogs, but they rarely
    show numerals, so it will be hard to pin this down for me.\r\n\r\nGood luck with
    your search, but this era was also one with a lot of hand-drawn lettering, which
    might turn out to be the answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    types since I found similarities in Modern no 20, Torino and some others to.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBabak"
