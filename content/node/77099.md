  \r\n\r\nBut since House Industries and HF&J are not yet on board, I\u2019m looking
  for similar alternative. Oh hivemind, can you suggest some alternatives to Neutraface
  or Verlag?"

    enough Typekit offers some other Hannes von D\xF6hren fonts."

    fonts aren't <a href=\"http://static.typekit.com/render-waterfall-56738-ie7-windows-xp.png\">hinted

  body: That's interesting Stephen - I always wondered how used Windows users are
    to sub-par font rendering, so whether it is something they notice or not.

  body: They usually see fonts like Georgia, Arial, and Verdana that were optimized
    for Windows, so it hasn't been a big issue until now that <a href="http://typographica.org/2010/on-typography/the-webfont-revolution-is-over-let-the-evolution-begin/">new
    webfonts are available that aren't always optimized</a>.
