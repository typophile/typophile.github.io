body: 'I hope the group doesn&#39;t mind too much, my continuing this thread a little
  longer. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve grouped several replies to comments in the end zone of
  the original thread, below.... <BR> <BR>Hopefully, it&#39;s informative and helpful.
  <BR> <BR> <BR>darrel said <BR> <BR>&#40;re my conjecturing about  <BR>the probable
  future of fighting  <BR>font software piracy,  <BR>compared to recent  <BR>Recording
  Industry Association of America  <BR>legal actions/inroads against  <BR>audio recording
  piracy&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;The solution we can use is called copyright law. <BR>&#62;It&#39;s
  not ideal, but it&#39;s what we have.  <BR> <BR> <BR>Yes, that&#39;s right. And,
  related: trademark and patent laws, where they apply &#40;in the case of fonts&#41;.
  <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;If you  <BR>&#62;truly are loosing a large amount of sales to
  a  <BR>&#62;pirate, then you call up the lawyers and act. Yes,  <BR>&#62;this favors
  the Adobes and RIAAs of the world... <BR>&#62;not the guy sitting in the basement
  making fonts.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>True, they&#39;re more likely to act fastest.
  But you do what you can. If you&#39;re a type designer being wronged, you have to
  act in some way proportional to what your business can tolerate and potentially
  succeed with. After all, it&#39;s your art. Your craft. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;I still
  stand behind my belief that the best  <BR>&#62;solution is simply to cater to your
  honest  <BR>&#62;consumers. <BR> <BR> <BR>Yes, I believe that you are exactly right
  about that. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;Educate people on piracy issues the best you can,  <BR>&#62;and
  hope that your product is good enough to  <BR>&#62;encourage enough to purchase.  <BR>
  <BR> <BR>True. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;This is where the RIAA is failing.  <BR>&#62;They
  are neither providing very good product  <BR>&#62;these days, and they aren&#39;t
  even willing to  <BR>&#62;let me purchase what I want  <BR> <BR> <BR>This is where
  I think that you&#39;re confusing things.  <BR> <BR>Not giving the public what it
  wants &#40;granted, often that&#39;s something of an amoeba; hard to pin down&#41;
  is nothing more than a major, possibly widespread, catastrophic failing of the marketing
  departments at the record companies to understand their market and how the market
  will react to a given talent in release.  <BR> <BR>I guess the point could be made
  that the failings of the marketing departments at the record companies have been
  going on now for perhaps a decade or two, as they have insisted &#40;according to
  published reports&#41; on continuing to move everything onto the compiled album
  as their central sales vehicle. <BR> <BR> <BR>Earlier providing music buyers with
  the opportunities to buy individual cuts and mix-and-match custom compilations -
  by about 1993 - would certainly have solved the problem of user frustration over
  buying options and cost.  <BR> <BR>And well before the popularization of the internet
  and the resusitation of peer-to-peer node networking to try to fill the lowest-common-denominator
  product availability gap. <BR> <BR> <BR>That availability of being able to buy right
  down to the individual font certainly works in the font industry very well.  <BR>
  <BR>It would seem the models in the type industry were there for the recording industry
  to mimic. <BR> <BR>&#40;And let&#39;s face it, the model of selling the creative
  product in the type industry, right down to the font, right down to buying a single
  letter, has existed for the world to see for how many centuries now?&#41; <BR> <BR>;-&#41;
  <BR> <BR>&#62;&#40;and, on top of  <BR>&#62;that, they sue their own consumers&#41;.  <BR>
  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s simply because of the documented violations of copyright law
  stacking up. In bulk. Massive, massive bulk quantities.  <BR> <BR>Surely you don&#39;t
  believe that they are suing their customers for the sport of it?  <BR> <BR>These
  undertakings are all major, and all major pains in the neck to managements, employees
  and to shareholders. If pirates backed off, and if ISPs had been more cooperative
  and did not seek to mask and protect obvious thievery, it would not have come to
  this, I&#39;d bet, based on what I&#39;ve read of it. <BR> <BR>If music lovers have
  been so concerned over the want of more buying options, why haven&#39;t we seen
  grassroots groups petitioning the record companies with plans outlined as to how
  their surveyed customer groups wanted to buy? I don&#39;t recall seeing any such
  effort reported, but of course, I might&#39;ve missed it. <BR> <BR>The recording
  companies, nonetheless, undoubtedly do their own focus group testing and other surveying,
  to determine customer desire. It&#39;s a natural part of marketing, especially where
  the total revenues at stake go into the realm of what&#39;s annually spent on CDs,
  concert performances, etc. <BR> <BR>Still, the record companies have a right to
  run their businesses as they see fit. It is their business. They have a right to
  market as they determine is best for them. After all, they&#39;re the ones who have
  invested in bringing the talent to market, or to broader audiences, than the talent
  might&#39;ve otherwise ever enjoyed on short schedule. <BR> <BR>If the market doesn&#39;t
  like the way they run their business, or how they package the works by artists they
  enjoy, then &#42;&#42;don&#39;t buy the products&#42;&#42;. <BR> <BR>&#40;No, I
  don&#39;t mean steal them instead. I mean, just walk away. Ignore them and their
  artists. Simply find something else to listen to. Yes, even if it means listening
  to free radio. Horrors!&#41; <BR> <BR>Also, write them and tell them you decided
  to walk away, to not buy. And why you made that decision. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, things
  never change for the better. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;They need to learn a basic premise
  of  <BR>&#62;capitalism...give the consumer what they  <BR>&#62;want at a sellable
  price...not what you,  <BR>&#62;as the vendor, wants. <BR> <BR>Agreed, wholeheartedly.
  <BR> <BR>But again, that they don&#39;t is not an argument to steal their property
  &#40;as defined under applicable copyright law&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Until you take over
  the recording company with a hostile buyout, etc., it is their business, and their
  properties. <BR> <BR>&#40;Again, apologies to the group for the length of this,
  but I think the comparisons to the type business are worth the ether. And believe
  me, after this, I&#39;m on ether. And I think I&#39;ve got the vapors, too. Whatever
  that is....&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>Hrant H Papazian said <BR> <BR>&#62;Joe, they&#39;re
  right. <BR> <BR>You mean the aliens who took our Elvis away?  <BR> <BR>;-&#41; <BR>
  <BR>I respect your opinion, but I personally don&#39;t think they&#39;re right.
  I think they&#39;re mixing unrelated arguments into a witches&#39; brew, muddling
  it. Which is why I&#39;m bothering to spend time helping to sort this out. <BR>
  <BR>&#40;Yes, I&#39;m done now. Believe me, I&#39;m not trying to win any marathons.&#41;
  <BR> <BR>... <BR> <BR>And to my <BR> <BR>&#62; And we&#39;re all very lucky we don&#39;t
  live in such barbaric times.  <BR> <BR>Hrant said <BR> <BR>&#62;Joe, I&#39;m sorry,
  but: are you nuts?  <BR>&#62;Where do you get your news, the Disney channel?  <BR>&#62;And
  where have you travelled to recently, <BR>&#62;Legoland? <BR> <BR> <BR>:-&#41;  I
  was being sarcastic, momentarily. <BR> <BR>&#40;I would like to visit Legoland sometime.
  The various installations of Lego I&#39;ve seen, and the pictures and video of Legoland,
  look fun.&#41;                                    <BR>                                     <BR>                                     <BR>Keith
  Tam said <BR> <BR>&#62;...Typeface design is such a thankless job. Graphic designers
  rarely even give credit to the typeface used, never mind the type designer. Why
  would they even reveal the name of the typeface they used when they didn&#39;t even
  pay for it?! Honestly, I don&#39;t see any cut-and-dry way to solve the font piracy
  problem. Only education can solve it, I think. I really shouldn&#39;t tell you this,
  but I&#39;ve had an instructor who made a Zip disk full of fonts available for us
  to use/copy. Now that&#39;s really unethical, and it is terribly damaging to the
  type business. It makes it normal for designers to copy and pass around fonts. Most
  people here &#40;I assume&#41; won&#39;t even dream of pirating fonts. Why? We are
  just conscientious? We simply appreciate the beauty of typefaces, respect the talents
  of those who designed them, and understand how much work it takes to design and
  produce a great typeface. Only when the these values and artistic appreciation abilities
  are imparted to the students would they stop pirating fonts. These are acquired
  skills, and can be learnt. Students have to understand that they don&#39;t need
  every single typeface in the world at their fingertips to do great designs. They
  have to understand a good type library has to be built gradually, over time. <BR>                                     <BR>                                     <BR>
  <BR>Keith, thanks very much for your insights. They add a lot to the discussion.
  <BR> <BR>That an instructor would actually do that in 2003 is not just surprising.
  It&#39;s horrifying for all involved. <BR> <BR>And a good indicator of just how
  confused the market still is about font piracy. Even amongst people like educators
  who one would think would know better. <BR> <BR>Thanks so much for adding what you
  wrote. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR>'

  body: Well, we&#39;re debating the RIAA more now, which is a topic I like to do,
    but probably isn&#39;t too on topic. <BR> <BR>Anyways, the point is that 60 million
    people download music off of P2P networks. The RIAA can either sue everyone, or
    consider listening to the market and accomodating. <BR> <BR>&#62; Yes, even if
    it means listening to free radio. Horrors! <BR> <BR>Who do you think runs the
    &#39;free&#39; radios? ;o&#41;

    make things better by walking away from a monster - you have to defeat it. <BR>I
    don&#39;t pirate songs &#40;except if merely listening to Shoutcast counts, but
    I don&#39;t think <BR>it does&#41;, but I would love to see the RIAA die a burning
    death. <BR> <BR>&#62; It&#39;s horrifying for all involved. <BR> <BR>What do you
    expect when their governments pursue ruthless imperialism at the expense of the
    wellbeing and <i>lives</i> of other peoples? Bad behavior is contagious and self-validating.

    version, when ordered in the same transaction or within the same month.  <BR>
    <BR>So for instance, ordering four from us, one receives: Family volume discount

    discount taking off the next 50%.  <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re a student or educator,

    <BR>Protection for at least the data description of an outline letter has gotten
    better in recent years. <BR> <BR>The reason why the USA has lagged so far behind
    other nations on this in many ways boils down to the significant amounts of lobbying
    and lying to the courts over the decades, effectively fooling the lawmakers into
    believing that font letterforms are more or less generic carriers, with no intrinsic
    unique value. <BR> <BR>As with the glazing over that your family and friends do
    when you start to describe what you do as a designer, so have the judges trying
    cases against pirates in earlier decades.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not unusual for the
    judges to fall asleep when the exposition turns to comparing two blowups of the
    letter A, for instance, with callouts showing similarities.... <BR> <BR>Joe <BR>
