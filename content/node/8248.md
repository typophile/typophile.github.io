  shirts. It&#39;s about typefaces, legibility, colour, weight, et cetera.  <BR>Recently
  I have added a section about the use of shirt numbers for branding: shirt numbers
  used as a kind of corporate style. Everyone who is interested is invited to pay
  a visit at <a href="http://www.letterbeeld.nl" target="_blank">www.letterbeeld.nl</a>.
  And if you have useful additions to the site, please let me know.'
