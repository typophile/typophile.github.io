body: "This one's got me stumped. At first I thought it was Akzidenz until I spotted
  the short chinned \"G\". Also, the \"A\" seems too wide, too perfectly triangular
  to be any of my go-to neo-grotesques. The high crossbar on that \"A\" seems to rule
  out many modern geometric faces too. \r\n\r\nAny ideas? Many thanks to anyone that
  can help me here."
