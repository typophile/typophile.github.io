  body: Yes the risks of developing a typeface compared to the viability of your company
    hinged on developing new cell processor chips and blu ray. Staggering.

    story started making the rounds I had no clue what, if anything, was behind the
    PS3 design. It amazes me how clueless Sony is about design."

    where he says that his child saw some Spider-Man posters and kept saying "PLAYSTATION
    3". I forget how old his son is, but pretty young I think. Interesting to think
    of children making such subconscious typographic connections.

    you think these are really subconscious? When my daughter was one and a half probably
    half of her vocabulary was brand names, and she could certainly recognize logos
    well before she could read. She often made this type of 'mistake' where a sign
    used, say, a Starbucks or Disney style font to advertise something else. "

      wasn't the right term, but I was referring to how automatically the association
      occurs within the child's mind."

  body: "\"and she could certainly recognize logos well before she could read\"\r\n\r\nIt's
    amazingly scary. You really don't quite absorb how pervasive advertising in our
    culture is until you have a child. Our 5 year old was pointing out brand names
    almost as soon as they started talking. \r\n\r\nWhen he was 3 we were at a gas
    station and he started saying \"Hey! I've been there!\". Took me a while to figure
    out what he was referring to. Turns out he had seen a 2\" Lienenkugel logo at
    the bottom of a poster on the wall and had remembered the brewery tour he had
    gone on with Grandpa."

    a half. Cab pulled up next to a Budweiser truck and she starts pointing and saying
    \"Bud, Bud, Bud\" it took a while to realize she was pointing the eagle on the
    logo and was trying to say \"bird\".\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's true that even 4 year old's can recognize logos. It will definately has
    some sort of effects on them later on. Causing them to judge art based on what
    they have seen before previously.
