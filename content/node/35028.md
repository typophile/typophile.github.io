body: "Looking for some help finding a good font management system that won't cost
  me my first born.  There are about 20 people in my office (branding agency - about
  half creative peeps) and our fonts are a mess. I am trying to implement some sort
  organization to this chaos. So far all I have some across is Font Reserve/Fusion
  - by Extensis, and Font Agent.  I have tinkered around with Font Explorer by Linotype,
  but it really isn't designed to handle company wide interface, and it has no back
  end.  If anybody has any suggestions about systems they use or have heard of I would
  appreciate it.  Thanks.\r\n\r\nDesigner in need."

  body: "I've given up on font management software. They are all a complete disaster
    as far as I'm concerned. Here's my workflow:\r\n\r\nI just drag a copy of the
    fonts I need open to the ~/Library/Fonts directory. I usually keep a different
    folder for each project. When I want to uninstall, I just drag the folder from
    my Fonts directory into the project folder itself. That way it's easy to install
    all the fonts needed when I want to open an archived project. It also allows other
    people in the office to open the files (without a complicated server setup).\r\n\r\nThis
    also helps with the multitude of in-production fonts I have installed at any point
    in time. Try feeding any type manager a steady stream of in-progress font versions;
    it's bad news."

    on lynda.com for Suitcase Fusion, Font Book Essentials and Font Agent and found
    them very enlightening.  http://movielibrary.lynda.com/html/modPage.asp?ID=251\r\n\r\nIf
    you don't subscribe to Lynda.com, you can get a week free by going to http://www.lynda.com/deke

    to this problem. For all of Steve Jobs' rhetoric about bringing great typography
    and proportional fonts to the PC, you'd think that that a Mac would at least have
    a some sort of organizational structure for fonts that didn't suck. \r\n\r\nI
    mean, at least 5 different places for fonts if you're using Adobe's stuff? Fontbook?
    A ginormous joke.\r\n\r\nAt least FontExplorer X is free."

  body: I've bought them all after lamenting the phasing out of the ATM. I work with
    hundreds of fonts and believe it or not the Font Book is about 95% workable. I
    use a backup external hard drive to store my fonts and when I load Font Book I
    pull them from it without losing the fonts.
