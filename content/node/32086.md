    as the OS.  The scratch disk preferably has its own partition.  Mine is on a separate
    drive on the first partition of that drive and I use other partitions as back-up
    scratch disks. CS3 seems to be scratch hungry.\r\n\r\nSharon\r\n\r\nI"

  body: I have installed photoshop on a different partition as Windows. I guess, but
    I don't know if it's specifically needed, the scratch should be on the OS-partition.
