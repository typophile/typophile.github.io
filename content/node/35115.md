body: Hi all. I'm currently in the process of branding a company (Loa Creative) and
  wanted to get a few suggestions on a nice, strong blackletter face that has that
  "feel". I've been looking at a few 19th Century medicine labels (friend is a fanatical
  collector of them) and noticed that A LOT of them promoted themselves via blackletter
  faces. I was looking for a face that encompassed something archaic, but still familiar.
  I'm not particularly looking for legibilty, as it will be used in conjuction with
  symbols used in the vodoun religion (hense the name Loa). Any suggestions?? Thanks!

    Brokenscript</a> is also simple enough that it avoids the legibility issues with
    other blacketters in the modern world.

    has the feel of black letter, even though it's not a black letter.
