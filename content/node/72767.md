  sans).\r\nI only have theese sings, but they need a lot of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fenixsample_5670.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Problems
  I see:</strong>\r\n- I dont know how to solve the upper part of the \"f\".\r\n  Do
  you think it needs more ascender space?\r\n- \"g\" weard\r\n- \"j\" cant solve lower
  part\r\n- \"k\" boring\r\n- \"s\" not quiet working yet\r\n- \"v\" \"w\" need work\r\n-
  \"y\" cant solve lower part\r\n- \"z\" a nightmare!\r\n- Just started working on
  kern and track\r\n  Will do Walter Tracey's method soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecieving feedback!.\r\nBest
  regards and thanks!\r\n(Tambi\xE9n hablo espa\xF1ol, \r\ncualquier cosa a las \xF3rdenes)"

  body: "You could also lower the crossbar of /f/ (and correspondingly that of /t/,
    I guess) a bit, rather than raising the ascender.\r\nI think you've observed well
    the parts that most need work. (Though the /z/ isn't a nightmare - maybe just
    needs a wider base.) Once you can get a good suitable hook shape, that will largely
    solve the problems of /f/j/y/ (and /r/ too, and maybe even /s/).\r\nI'd try a
    /v/ and /w/ that are less flat on the bottom.\r\nBottom of /t/ looks a little
    weird to me too.\r\nI find the /x/ very interesting!"

  body: "Hola Fernando. My considerations:\r\n\r\n<strong>01</strong>: acute inclination
    was the first thing that did call my attention. It's semi-horizontal and very
    large. Of course, this is a design choice, but you must take in account three
    consequences: (a) large acute means large grave, with undesired collision in f\xEC.
    (b) It demands special kerning to i as the accent is larger than the letter. (c)
    You need alternate accents to get correct Polish diacritics because kreska, although
    similar to acute, is almost vertical.\r\n\r\n<strong>02</strong>: c seems a bit
    narrow to me.\r\n\r\n<strong>03</strong>: g could get two small improvements.
    Ear may be more thin at the base, where it links to the first bowl. And second
    bowl could have a subtle angle in its internal curve at left, following in some
    degree the standard of o.\r\n\r\n<strong>04</strong>: I understand you want to
    apply the angled cut in all glyphs as this is a distinctive element of Fenix.
    But sometimes this may need to be softer to avoid a forced appearance. It's the
    case of j. Right line seems OK, but the left side would have a simple curve or
    a very subtle angled line.\r\n\r\n<strong>05</strong>: I like your k. Not boring
    to me. The same about z, quite good.\r\n\r\n<strong>06</strong>: s may work better
    with terminals reduced a bit.\r\n\r\n<strong>07</strong>: what about an ink trap
    inside the middle internal angle of w?\r\n\r\n<strong>08</strong>: I'm not the
    one to talk about y terminal or f ascender as these were problems to my own [[http://typophile.com/node/67787|font]]...\r\n\r\nYour
    tilde is very nice, but the dieresis needs dots a bit more near. Excellent p,
    q and x. General design is beautiful, with a lot of character. I think this will
    develop to a very good result, as you already done with Quiroga.\r\n"

  body: "@eliason \r\n\r\nThanks for the comments, I'll try them on my new version.\r\nThe
    \"v\" and \"w\" looked wierd to me, but I didn't know why! now i know :)\r\nPS:
    .I preffer not to lower the crossbars becouse they are alligned to the \"x\" height,
    but, I'll give it a try! You never know, right? \r\n\r\n@Freiberger \r\n\r\nThanks
    for commenting, I agree with your comments, really helped!\r\nLater today I'll
    be commenting on your work :)\r\nQuiroga was my first font! This is my second
    (along with libertad, and I'm working on a script called \"Helena\" too).\r\n"

  body: 'I''m liking this one, it''s lovely. It''ll be interesting to see how you
    resolve j and y. (But probably a good idea to sketch out the uppercase first).
    Unfortunately I''m not able to look in depth right now but hope to come back to
    you in a couple of weeks with some crit. '
