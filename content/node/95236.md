body: Is there available any book or masters/phd thesis strictly about what I would
  call 'line,'  or 'curve?'  Not even about shape, and not about line in relation
  to its surrounding, but about why certain lines look 'smart' and other lines look
  'unitelligent', while some look 'cool' and others look 'sophisticated?'

    the three volumes the 'line' is extensively essayed by many. I highly recommend
    having these books on the shelf. \r\n\r\nn."
