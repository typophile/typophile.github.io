  body: "Your description tells me these are too old to be 'fonts' in the digital
    sense. Your best chance to replicate them is to look for 'license plate' or 'monospace'
    fonts. For example, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/brassfonts/corpa-gothic/|Corpa
    Gothic]] is a fair match for the letters and some of the numerals, while [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/brassfonts/corpa-serif/|Corpa
    Serif]] has a pretty close 4 to your top sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
