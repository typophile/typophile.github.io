  Man Made Music and it will go out to their clients (NBC, ABC, HBO, etc). It has
  an ornament cut out of the circular part of the musical note.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mmm_outside2.gif]"

  body: "Nothing like getting a head start, I suppose.\r\n\r\nThe ornament silhouette
    doesn't really work for me. Maybe the pattern in the clef could be made more snowflakey?\r\n\r\nWhy
    is the type so many different sizes? Restraint is always tasteful.\r\n\r\nWhy
    is \"Joyous\" capitalized?\r\n\r\nNot so wild about the swashy initial 'W'. Perhaps
    it would be best to replace all of the text with a more scriptlike serif face
    like Brioso or one of the ten gazillion excellent script faces that have come
    out over the last few years."

  body: "I read the ornament as a cartoon bomb, the top right ornament seems superfluous
    as does the full stop at the end of the message.\r\nYou need to spend some time
    working on the type; it seems tracked too tight and the relationships between
    the lines aren't working in terms of size or alignment and further have little
    relationship to your note device.\r\nTim"
