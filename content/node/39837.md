body: "As an old-school-trained typo (ie: pencils and character counting, definitely
  a dead art) I sometimes struggle with applications like Flash, which seem never
  intended to natively support what I consider to be basic typographic considerations
  such as ligatures.\r\n\r\nUsing my Mac, I can easily type Option-Shift-5 for an
  'fi' lig and Option-Shift-6 for an 'fl', but what do I do when I want more ligatures?\r\n\r\nI'm
  specifically after an 'ffi' lig, which I don't know the key combination for. But
  how would I determine the key combos for this, or for an 'ffl' - especially when
  I have an expert set available?\r\n\r\nIs there an app or utility which would look
  at the font and tell me what key combo to use? I seem to remember something that
  did this under Mac System 7, 8 and 9 (showing my age now, lol), but can't find anything
  similar for OSX.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this final bit of info is relevant or not,
  but it's an Open Type font I'm using - a well-crafted one too, so I'm sure the ligatures
  will be present.\r\n\r\nPlease help me find them!"

    In apps like word these ligatures may not be available at all.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In old Postscript fonts, these ligatures, when provided, would have been
    accessible via the keyboard because they would have been put in place of other
    characters (rather than having a place of their own). So, for instance, typing
    a W would yield the ffi character in an old Adobe expert set. Other foundries
    had/have different standards. (For instance, H&FJ and Font Bureau would put ffi
    in the \u221E position in their regular fonts.)\r\n\r\nIn an Opentype font, however,
    ff-ligatures have their own unique place, but cannot be accessed via the keyboard.
    They must be deployed via OpenType layout features (specifically the {liga} feature).
    Or they may be manually inserted, if the application offers a method to do this
    (such as the glyph palette in Adobe applications).\r\n\r\nIf your application
    provides neither of these, then you may be out of luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- K."

    I think I broadly understand what you mean, but in an application like Flash (where
    I have my specific problem), apart from using key combinations, how would I deploy
    the ligatures I need? \r\n\r\nI think I'm basically asking how do I find the characters
    I require?"

  body: ff, ffl, and ffi all have standard Unicode values (in the code page "Alphabetic
    Prsentation Forms") -- so foundries that include them in fonts are likely to give
    them the appropriate cooding.

  body: "Jon -- In case you check back, and in case it still might not be clear from
    the foregoing, OT layout features, like {liga}, are bits of programming inside
    the font that provide rules for substitutions and the like. In order for a user
    like yourself to take advantage of these features, an application needs to provide
    support for them. \r\n\r\nThere are specifications for certain features to be
    activated by default; others are discretionary, to be applied on an ad hoc basis.
    The application needs to be written to implement these kinds of OT layout features
    and then provide an interface for the user to activate or deactivate them. \r\n\r\nApparently
    Flash does not do so yet.\r\n\r\nLevels of support for OpenType layout features
    vary widely between applications still, and this whole arena is still in a state
    of flux. \r\n\r\nHTH. Sorry to have left you hanging earlier. I'm glad that Zachary
    provided a workable solution for you.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
