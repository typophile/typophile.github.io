body: "Yesterday, whilst looking on the Internet for something else (you know how
  that happens!), I came across the name of a printer, ISAAC THOMAS, whom some have
  called \"the American Baskerville\". \r\n\r\nAlso on Internet, I have been able
  to locate one book printed by him, and I would guess that he used his own font (typeface)
  \u2014 to me, it is just a bit reminiscent of Baskerville Old Face!\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  what I would like to ask you is this: do you know whether it is possible to obtain,
  for my Mac computer (using OS X 10.4), any font(s) using or incorporating Isaak
  Thomas' typeface?\r\n\r\nWhen you have a  moment, I'd be very grateful for any assistance
  you'd be able to provide.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is the weather where you live?\r\n\r\nHere
  in Perth, we've had the coldest June on record: for the first time, the overnight
  temperature went below zero degrees Celsius...\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery good wish,\r\n\r\nYours\r\n\r\nAndrew"
