    though, it looks lost or like a separate element. '

  body: I saw the bikini top first, and didn't see the figure and initials.  I question
    what the circle adds to the design.  The colors and style feel a bit more casual
    and surfer than upscale formal.  Not sure how the circle plays into that idea,
    or if it is fitting to the company.  But I agree with the others about the bottom
    right font choice being best.  Neat concept.

    Your mark is strong enough as is, IMO. I happen to like the circle and colour
    choice very much, but that's just me. The type doesn't work for me. It could be
    so much stronger. Perhaps something handwritten, or something that followed the
    circle shape. If you're uncomfortable drawing type yourself, there's no shame
    in hiring help! After all, most of us (Typophiles) are type designers.

  body: "Thank you for the feedback. Rather than an upscale image, I believe the company
    wants to give off a warmer, lighter feeling while still projecting a professional
    image. They requested the use of warm earth tones and provided me with a pdf with
    images of natural elements. As for the circle, I added it because just having
    the bikini top looked unbalanced to me. I felt the circle sort of glued everything
    together. If you guys have any suggestions on that, please let me know. I did
    try something hand-written but it ended up looking a bit kiddish which would not
    fit the target audience. But again, I'm open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere are three
    versions with varying weights of the bottom right rendition. Personally, I like
    the second one the best but I'd like to hear some thoughts on that.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample2_5396.jpg]"

  body: "I suppose the logo is final. So I comment with caution and respect.\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if the circle isn't causing the illustration to be a little misread. (I
    first saw a very curvy body shape with large thighs, but now see the top.) Could
    the shape in which the top sits be a little more organic or interact somehow with
    the top? It feels as if the top is trapped. Or could the straps somehow interact
    with the circle?\r\n\r\nHaving a second color in the type, for me, disconnects
    the mark from the logotype. Or will you, somehow, include an accent of the 2nd
    color in the mark?"

    the bikini top instead of a green torso with large white thighs. Maybe because
    the bikini top is so low in the circle. (Or maybe I was just projecting my feelings
    about myself in a bathing suit...oops, TMI.)\r\n\r\nI prefer the medium weight
    type."

    the orange color of the text disconnects it from the mark."

    taking the time to showing me your vision. I showed my previous rendition to the
    client and unfortunately I was way off. She was looking for more of a sexy/clean/modern/earthy
    vibe with a non-literal mark. Also, apparently, the one I showed her gave off
    a \"maternity\" feeling. She gave me some new direction and wanted me to focus
    on the ampersand so it could be used both as part of the logo and separately as
    an abbreviated mark.\r\n\r\nSo, here's what I came up with:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample4_5181.jpg]\r\n\r\nYour

    I agree 100%. That's why I'm trying to keep the image insertions to a minimum.

  body: Sans Serif has a more modern feeling to it, Slab I think is a little too manly
    for a swimwear company unless you used something light. I think the comment that
    jakes made about the newer iterations being old fashioned was on the money, especially
    using the ampersand as the logomark of the type. Nevertheless, the ampersand is
    one of my favourite glyphs. On the other hand, the blue/orange colour scheme really
    works. I think the primary problem with the stylisations of the ampersand is scale,
    none of them really hold up to scaling very well. What about abbreviating Lauren
    & Holly to just L&H? If the client wants to appeal to 20's and 30's they ought
    to reconsider your original direction, perhaps if you tried rehashing some iteration
    of your original with the pizazz of the new direction? I dunno, tough case but
    I think you've brought a lot to the table.
