  Venison?\r\n\r\nIt's the main sans serif used on the overall brand, rather than
  the various different typefaces used for individual exhibitions etc.\r\n\r\nhttp://spin.co.uk/work-by-discipline/identity/haunch-of-venison\r\n\r\nEverything
  I've been looking at with those 'U's without the stem etc. etc. have straight arms
  (? is that the correct term?) on the uppercase 'R', but if you look closely on the
  vertical set type down the side of some of the posters, if you have a look at the
  words 'BERLIN' and 'ZURICH' it appears there is a slight curve on the 'R' there.\r\n\r\nI'm
  stumped!\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    a slight curve on the 'R' there". So yes, there's big chance it could be Haas
    Unica.
