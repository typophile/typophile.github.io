    you would still think that they would have decent newspaper design.\r\n\r\n(No,
    I don't know what the type is)."

    software baffle them. Apparently.

  body: "I would think that it is not a custom designed logo. I say this because of
    the limited amount of time this logo is actually on screen during the movies.
    If it is custom designed, I doubt its anything more than a few modified letters.
    It really wouldn't be worth the time of putting a lot of work into a logo when
    its only going to be on screen for 5-10 seconds tops. And since newspapers in
    Potterland have animations on them, I doubt anyone is going to spend much time
    looking at the logo of the paper. Anyway, thanks for the suggestion. Its not quite
    what I was looking for, but if it comes down to it I guess it may have to do :D\r\n\r\nThanks
    everyone! And if anyone else knows what it is, I'm still open to suggestions."

  body: Also I don't think the P's are different. I think that the first one may be
    bold and the latter is not? could be wrong though.
