  that was offering high quality scans &#40;300 DPI&#41; of some really old books</b>
  &#40;from the 14th to 19th century I think&#41;. <BR> <BR>As far as I remember it
  was in italian or spanish, a kind of an online exhibition of a museum or a foundation.
  There were italian, spanish, french, german and english books. Per book there were
  at least 3 scans. Mostly one of the title page, some illustrations and the colophon.
  <BR> <BR>And I tell you, the illustrations in those books were more than fantastic!
  As I first saw it I was thinking &#34;now that&#39;s for sure the best way to study
  old faces online&#34;. <BR> <BR><b>Now, can somebody help me out with the URL?</b>
  &#40;I&#39;ve lost it due to a hard drive crash..&#41; <BR> <BR>The only thing that
  comes close to it is <a href="http://wally.rit.edu/cary/cc_db/subject_library.html"
  target="_blank">http://wally.rit.edu/cary/cc_db/subject_library.html</a> but it
  is still miles away of the material offered on the other website. <BR> <BR>Thank
  you, <BR>Roman Schechtel <BR>&#40;for german readers: <a href="http://www.designmadeingermany.de/forum.php4?thread_ID=3549"

  body: 'Octavo rules. <BR> <BR>I recently did a little &#34;experiment&#34; in separating
    the ink and the impression from letterpress. <BR>Instead of the front, I took
    the <i>backside</i> of the impression of a large &#34;R&#34; from an Octavo book...
    <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/21488.jpg" alt="R_f&amp;b.jpg">
    <BR> <BR>then flipped it horizontally and inverted the brightness: <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/21489.gif" alt="R_noink.gif">
    <BR> <BR>So that&#39;s the impression itself &#40;although somewhat damped by
    the consistency of the paper&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I bought the Octavo CD of Bodoni&#39;s &#34;Manuale&#34; but didn&#39;t think
    the resolution &#40;300 dpi?&#41; was sharp enough for a really good inspection
    of the type. <BR> <BR>I guess I&#39;m spoiled by my plain ol&#39; $150 desktop
    scanner &#40;Snapscan&#41;, which is like a microscope, at least 1200 dpi, if
    I recall.

  body: '&#62; Snapscan <BR> <BR>That&#39;s the one I have too! &#40;Or actually the
    &#34;Touch&#34; model&#41;. I love it - the secret is the stellar Agfa software.
    Damn shame they stopped making scanners. BTW, it only goes to 600 optical - at
    least in the lateral dimension. BTW, if you want a real microscope, check out
    drum scanners: 4000-8000 dpi! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Hello again, <BR> <BR>your postings were quite interesting this far,  <BR>but
    the website I&#39;m searching for wasn&#39;t <BR>mentioned.. Octavo seems interesting
    too. <BR> <BR>Maybe someone else knows the one I&#39;m searching for?

  body: Roman, you might also try searching through Georgetown&#39;s <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/labyrinth/labyrinth-home.html"
    target="_blank">Labyrinth</a>. It is an amazing resource for anyone interested
    in Manuscripts, Codicology, Paleography, Incunabula, etc.
