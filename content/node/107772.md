  and the \"Songs for Rounders\" font. \r\n\r\nAs for the third, I am guessing the
  stylized \"S\" is hand drawn, maybe?  \r\n\r\nTHANKS as always...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hank-Thompson-LP-1_4512.jpg]"

    the ball was hung close to the terminal, like the one used on your S.  Other times
    the tail was extended to cross the diagonal. Very few are digitized. \r\nFont
    Mesa's Livery Stable \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/livery-stable/\r\nhas
    an S with the tail and ball in a similar position to your S. The Victorian font,
    known as Glyptic, was designed by Herman Ihlengerg. Later also sold under the
    name Morgan TwentyNine. Digital under this name by FontShop 1999. Don't know where
    you could get a legitimate copy.\r\nFor a ball hung by a tail to below the diagonal

  body: "I didn't mention OPTI's Morgan TwentyNine because of the legitimacy issue.
    I recall the alt.binaries.fonts discussions of OPTI fonts. My conclusion is that
    any commercial use would be very questionable. Thus I did not include a link to
    the OPTI font archive.\r\nOPTI was a notorious font piracy operation, but it did
    produce some original fonts. OPTI's Morgan TwentyNine could perhaps be original.\r\nThe
    issue of commercial use orphan fonts, as far as I know, has not yet been ruled
    on by the courts in the US or elsewhere. In any event, it's not smart business
    practice to risk being the subject of a test case.\r\nGiven the aggressive methods
    of intellectual property interests, I would not put it past them to come down
    like a ton  of bricks on an individual who uses an orphan font, even where the
    individual does not make a financial gain from using the font.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nRe: Don's comment about \"Morgan Twenty Nine\" and not knowing
    where to get a legitimate copy - well, as I recall it was at one time retailed
    by OPTI Fonts who folded in 2005. \r\n\r\n<strong>EDIT:</strong> part of original
    comment redacted by Doghouse\r\n\r\nO.K. Right!\r\n\r\nNow, since these fonts
    are no longer available for sale, it seems they have become widely regarded as
    \"abandoned\" or \"orphaned\" fonts. \r\n\r\nDoes that make them legitimate? \r\n\r\nI'm
    not so sure, it's a bit of an odd one! \r\n\r\nThis \"Typophile thread\" about
    Castcraft doesn't make the legal side too clear and it's a mash up of the info
    available on the Luc Devroye site.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/69064\r\n\r\nMaybe
    someone can take the time to enlighten (me) us with the legal aspects of this
    sort of stuff. \r\n\r\nNote: I'm not advocating font piracy - please advise.\r\n\r\nDoghouse"

  body: "Thanks for taking the time to comment on my legal question Don, and as I
    noted previously - I would certainly not want advocate any form of font piracy.
    \r\n\r\nI simply mentioned OPTIFonts due to the fact that theirs was the only
    \"legitimate\" version of Morgan Twenty Nine that I was aware of. Although much
    of their catalogue is nowadays often regarded as \"bootleg typefaces\" I know
    a great many design studios and reprographic companies who legitimately paid the
    full price, in good faith, for Castcraft's complete library of OPTI CDROMs. \r\n\r\nConsequently,
    it appears anyone who now searches for OPTI fonts is bound to turn up the same
    references that I did. That in turn leads us into the murky world of flakey copies,
    available under the decidedly dodgy banner of \"abandoned\" and \"orphan\" fonts,
    and all that may entail. I was just seeking some clarification on the copyright
    issues etc., as the original vendor company is no longer in existence.\r\n\r\nSo
    that's clear - just say NO kids!\r\n\r\nI will edit my previous comment to suit.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nDoghouse"
