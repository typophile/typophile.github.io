body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI started a new project from some calligraphic quadrata drawings
  I had in a drawer. The source displayed in my pic is not my calligraphy, just an
  example of the structure of the calligraphy. But I have a question about the way
  the interpretation may be. Here is my \"problem\". The quadrata was a calligraphic
  model that has been abandonned because it was too \"straight\" to draw regarding
  the tools used by the monk at the time. When I was drawing my calligraphic model
  I was using a wooden calam and it turns out that the result was straight but subtle.
  So here is my interrogation. Would it be more logical to go for #1 or #2 interpretation
  knowing the historical factor of the calligraphy?"

    2. I'would suggest to reduce the thickness of the serif and probably do the same
    for the stem.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    to the calligraphy. But slightly reducing the weight of the serifs / stem would
    be a good idea."

    my last font design that it was very convenient to start designing the bold weights
    before the regular ones\u2026"

  body: "I've already started my first typeface by the bold weight and I will not
    do de same anymore. The problem to my point of view when you choose that way is
    that you have to draw almost all the weight without the benefit of the interpolation.
    For my second one I've start by the light one and I did the black in a second
    step. Choosing that way I've been able to easily work with the interpolation with
    less adjustments.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Drawing the bold is much more fun :) I used to draw the regular first then
    the hairline then the bold. But it turns out that I had too make so much corrections
    on the 2 first weights that sometimes I almost redraw them completely. The bold
    weight let you \"push\" the weight to the extremes you need. If it works in bold
    it will work in the lighter weight almost always, the contrary is not always true.\r\nFor
    my last 2 fonts I first draw the extra bold and the hairline weights and interpolate
    the regular. It was assle free for me\u2026\r\nAnd if your points are on the right
    spots it is super easy to do the rest of the weights.\r\n"
