  can get your copy here:\r\n\r\nhttp://j.mp/OhdJj6 (USA)\r\n\r\nhttp://j.mp/NRVdxY
  (UK)\r\n\r\nPlease don't buy the book if you are a contributor to it. I'm still
  working on a special \"contributors' edition\" for the Kindle, drop me an email,
  and I'll get a special edition sent to you when completed.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm very
  pleased with how the project has turned out. Thanks to everyone who has helped out
  with tips on producing the cover, etc.\r\n\r\nAll the Best\r\nDave Hughes\r\nYork,

  body: "Yes, I agree it is somewhat ironic, but the premise of the book is to preserve
    memories of letterpress traditions, so I think the format is appropriate.\r\n\r\nI
    have now made the book available in all formats, via Smashwords here:\r\nhttp://www.smashwords.com/books/view/236258"
