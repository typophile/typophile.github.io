body: "In a justified setting, when there is a dash at the beginning or end of a line,
  InDesign optical margin adjustment is out of control. It puts like half the dash
  into the margin.\r\nNow with a dash at the beginning of a line, I usually insert
  a soft line break before it and then a hair space, which the dash can then be kerned
  against to pull it in (out of the margin). But, any tricks on what to do with a
  dash at the end of the line? \r\nI can't seem to find a good way to pull those in.
  Any white space I add after them is not in fact added to the line in terms of pushing
  the dash in.\r\nIm still on CS4 in case it matters.\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I actually like the affect of the optical margin alignment, as it loosens
    the text a little, and gives more flexibility. \r\n\r\nAnd you can control it
    to some extent. When you go to to type>story it gives you an option of setting
    the type size, which will adjust how far the hyphen sticks into the margin. There
    is also on the fly-out from the paragraph menu an option to ignore optical margin,
    so you can turn it off as you like.  "

    wish Adobe would prioritize fixing potentially useful features like this\u2026
    That said, even if it is deficient, I still think <em>not</em> using it gives
    worse results overall. Which is why I'm trying to tame it somewhat.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"When
    you go to to type>story it gives you an option of setting the type size\"</cite>\r\nI
    did set that, but that's global, right? I have a feeling that some items (like
    dashes) just stick out disproportionately, so I'd love to have a way to selectively
    \xABpull them in\xBB. So William, thank you so much for the tip with the \xABignore
    optical margin\xBB option \u2013 I never realized it was there! :-) That is quite
    useful."
