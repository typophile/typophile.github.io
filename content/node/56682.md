  pretty excited about this new position. It's already turning out to be lots of fun,
  and gives me plenty of opportunities to learn new things, while working with a great
  crew of people and not leaving the type industry (albeit not involved in making
  fonts).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    even nicer than Seattle and anyway, I hope you will find it to be. And I second
    what Bill said!

  body: "Thanks, all. Yes, Portland seems pretty cool. We'll miss our friends in Seattle,
    and a few of the local cultural things, but in general this seems pretty great.
    \r\n\r\nWe're not buying a house right away, mostly because I believe the price
    of houses could still fall another 10, 20, maybe even 30%. We'll rent for at least
    a year, then buy once housing prices seem to have bottomed out or are starting
    to rise. (Even allowing substantially for costs and hassles of moving, and tax
    benefits of owning, if housing prices drop more than 3.5% in a year, we are better
    off renting.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    cool (although I'm going mostly on experience from almost two decades ago). I
    always liked PDX better than the Emerald City. I'm sure you'll learn to really
    love it. And this is great news for font management. Extensis is lucky to have
    you.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "i said:\r\n>   portland is just seattle in another state.\r\n\r\ni was trying
    to be positive, thomas, and\r\ni have no doubt portland will be great...\r\n\r\nbut...\r\n\r\nbut
    the truth is, i'm not a very good liar,\r\nnot even when i'm being a cheerful
    liar.\r\n\r\nand the truth is, portland might be fine,\r\nbut it's _no_ seattle,
    because there can be\r\nno other seattle, because seattle is unique.\r\n\r\nyou
    see, i lived in seattle when i went to u.w.\r\n\r\ngrew up in eastern washington,
    and then\r\nwent to u.w. 4 years as an undergraduate.\r\n\r\ni lived above the
    ship canal, west nickerson,\r\nand rode my bike over to campus every day,\r\nso
    i got stopped often by the fremont bridge.\r\n\r\n(it's the lowest drawbridge
    on the ship canal,\r\nmeaning it has to open more than any other.)\r\n\r\ni used
    to love getting stopped.  because it gave\r\nme a chance to stop and watch the
    ships go by,\r\nwhich is actually better than smelling the roses,\r\nbecause the
    smell of the roses will fade away,\r\nbut each ship was on a journey, and journey\r\nspurs
    the imagination to wonder itself away.\r\n\r\nwhere are they going?  what are
    they doing?\r\nwhen are they returning?  are they returning?\r\ni used to love
    getting stopped; i would watch.\r\n\r\nahh, my college years...\r\n\r\nthis was
    a long time ago, long before adobe\r\nbought that land north of the fremont bridge\r\nand
    built their stuff there -- a long time ago,\r\nway long before there even _was_
    an adobe...\r\n\r\nsince then, i'm sure the place has been gentrified,\r\nwhat
    with the fancy adobe buildings and the fancy\r\nadobe people and their fancy adobe
    power lunches.\r\n\r\ni'd like to think fremont will always hold on to its funk\r\n--
    and please don't bother to tell me if it's not true --\r\nbut i'm sure all that
    fancy has rubbed off onto some...\r\n\r\nbut gosh darn what a beautiful city.\r\n\r\nso...
    \ after the bridge, i'd bike alongside the water,\r\npast gasworks park, over
    by ivars, up onto campus.\r\n\r\nsome days after class, then i'd bike over to
    greenlake\r\n-- which is officially my favorite place in the world --\r\nand take
    a couple 3-mile spins doing the girlwatching.\r\n\r\ni loved seattle.\r\n\r\ni
    loved the locks, golden gardens, the greenest green.\r\n\r\ni loved the ferries.
    \ the washington state ferries.\r\n\r\ni loved the emerald city.\r\n\r\ni was
    sad when i had to leave seattle.\r\n\r\nand i'd guess that you're sad too, thomas.\r\n\r\ni'm
    sure portland will be fine.\r\n\r\nbut i knew seattle.\r\n\r\nand portland is
    no seattle...\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n\r\n"
