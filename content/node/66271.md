  body: "Sorry, I don't have any info on the type/lettering. But if you're looking
    for something similar, consider Mark Simonson's Goldenbook, which is \"based on
    the logotype of a literary magazine from the late 1920s\" -- the same era when
    the red phone kiosks were introduced.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/goldenbook.html"
