  the font? I would then like to convert it to any of the readable font's like \"arial\"
  or similar.\r\nIt's very difficult to read with the current font size. I read somewhere
  \ in google, that cursive font (which i think it is, in this image) cannot be identified
  by font sites. Iam not sure though. \r\nRequest your valuable time, to give me an
  opportunity to get through this."

    body: 'Thanks so much. That''s great. You identified very soon. I tried multiple
      times, before coming here. How can i convert this font  ITC Blackadder to any
      other easy reading format like "aerial" or similar font. Iam finding it difficult
      to read at this age 65. I need to stress a lot. Any free online tool to convert
      this to a readable font format? '
