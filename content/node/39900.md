body: "I am looking for a typeface(s) with tabular old style figures. Not one or the
  other as separate fonts, but tabular AND OsF. It seems like everything I come across
  with tabular figures, they are lining, and every old style figure is proportional,
  and I can't figure a way to easily search for this feature. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nIf
  there are more examples than I'm aware of, the application is for a lengthy academic
  journal, so a serif (or perhaps, sans serif) suitable for use as lengthy body copy
  is a requirement.\r\n"

    1's only, since work is done by several folks in non-OT-savvy Mac apps (eg, MS
    Word). Or an \"OT\" font without OT features, which has been converted from its
    Type 1 parent.\r\n\r\n"

    something novelty or decorative.

  body: "If you're making a numbered list, tabular figures are necessary--whether
    oldstyle or lining.\r\nIf you have a column of phone numbers (say on a business
    card--even if only two numbers), tabular figures make it so much neater.\r\nPrice
    lists, dates, contents pages, recipes, etc.\r\nWherever one or more numbers appears
    flush above another, then you should use tabular figures.\r\nAnd in those situations,
    why not have the option of old style figures?"
