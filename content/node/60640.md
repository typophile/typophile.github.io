  figure out what her title would be for the credits. She's creating all of the typographic
  material within the film (title, credits etc.) as well as all of the branding/identity
  and collateral material (posters, fliers, dvd packaging). From a design perspective,
  she's art directing, but Art Director seems to refer to a different thing in the
  film world.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts??\r\n\r\n"
