  body: Dav&#40;id&#41; is just out of control these last couple of weeks. He simply
    can&#39;t be caught!  <BR> <BR>Maybe he won&#39;t reveal his type tricks, but
    there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve always wondered about ... why the &#40;id&#41;
    as separate from the Dav? Is this just something I&#39;m not clued into? If I
    type David will it offend? And while we&#39;re here, why is Stephen Coles sometimes
    referred to as Stewf and do only personal friends call him that? What is preferred
    here? <BR> <BR>My hope is not to offend anyone by using the incorrect use of their
    name or irritate them by using a personal nickname when a formal one is preferred.

  body: Been covered before Patricia &#40;Patty&#41;. July 06, 2004 post by Yves but
    I can&#39;t find the thread, only the individual post. I prefer James and don&#39;t
    know why I put Jamie as my login name. Guess it must have been an idiot moment.
    I really don&#39;t care what I&#39;m called as long as it&#39;s not &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>.
    The Real Name/Login Name thing has a lot to do with it I think. I think only one,
    like the real name, should be displayed. Now on to other mysteries such as Is
    Cheshire Dave offended if you leave off the Cheshire?

    had to rate my entry to get to the thread. These  <BR>defective archives are giving
    me a major headache.

  body: That&#39;s the type of help I need Stephen. As for the cookies and chocolate,
    I wouldn&#39;t have the good taste in either to send you something decent. Furthermore,
    I&#39;ve not quite mastered European Customs or postage law and since I live in
    country curently run by fear mongers, I wouldn&#39;t wait by the mailbox quite
    yet. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
