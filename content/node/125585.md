  you could make a couple of suggestions on \r\nsuitable fonts for a wordmark conveying
  education, culture. \r\nIt should look modern, active and slightly quirky. \r\n\r\nThank
  you so much."

    alter the type (wordmarks or logotypes are rarely straight settings of a typeface)
    will also influence how the mark \u201Creads.\u201D\r\n\r\nPerhaps start with
    one foundry, like Sudtipos:\r\nhttp://sudtipos.com/home\r\n\r\nThey produce beautiful
    work in a range of styles; run your cursor over the typeface names to see samples
    (they have a typeface tester on the site, but not for all of their offerings;
    you can also find most of their catalog on MyFonts).\r\n\r\n"

    Perhaps Theorem or Downtempo.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks, Hrant, for your always valuable
    help and comments. Kursivschrift is certainly an interesting quirky font.\r\n"
