  body: Back in the first Macintosh days and the Imagewriter dot matrix printer, the
    fonts were all bitmap, and to print one size on the Imagewriter, one had to also
    have a font size twice as big....the Imagewriter used that double size font to
    make the output higher quality. I used the later Imagewriter II.
