As promised, I&#39;ll be sending out finished-version copies soon to everyone who helped. <BR> <BR>Anyway, this is my second font-making foray, and though it looks at first glance like a geometric sans serif, the curves and nuances on this one are decidedly un-geometric. <BR> <BR>My inspirations were the Canon EOS logo and Oban &#40;from this forum&#41;.  I wanted to make something solid and modern to be usable as a substitute for overused fonts like Handel Gothic. <BR> <BR>At this point, I only have the capitals and numerals.

		<div class="commentbody"><i>I wanted to make something solid and modern to be   <BR>usable as a substitute for overused fonts like Handel Gothic.</i>  <BR>  <BR>This is an excellent goal, Paul. You&#39;re on your way to   <BR>achieving it.  <BR>  <BR>Cristian is right about the &#39;Y&#39;. But I recognize your problem -   <BR>you were obviously trying to keep the middle bar consistent   <BR>on the &#39;Y&#39; and &#39;R&#39;. But the higher bars on the &#39;A&#39; &#39;B&#39; &#39;E&#39; work  <BR>fine so there is room to raise it on the &#39;Y&#39;. Or, are you   <BR>opposed to a descender?  <BR>  <BR>Consistent widths is a definite issue here. In addition to  <BR>Cristian&#39;s comments, I&#39;ll add that the &#39;J&#39; seems too wide and  <BR>the &#39;H&#39; too narrow.  <BR>  <BR>The &#39;H&#39; also feels too straight with the flat ends. I wonder if  <BR>there&#39;s a way to give them an angle as on the &#39;A&#39; and &#39;N&#39;.   <BR>See if you can make it happen without a Hobo effect. <BR> <BR>The &#39;B&#39; and &#39;S&#39; look fine to me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is rockin&#39;. I&#39;d agree with Stephen that the &#39;J&#39; seems too wide - maybe it should be more along the lines of &#39;L.&#39; I might say too that the &#39;T&#39; feels a bit too straight. Also, much like the &#39;Y,&#39; the &#39;2&#39; seems too have some quirky proportions because of the middle bar or spine.  <BR> <BR>I wonder if modeling the &#39;W&#39; after conjoined &#39;U&#39;s insteaded of &#39;V&#39;s might be worth trying.

		<div class="commentbody">This is fantabulous! <BR> <BR>But the 6 and 9 don&#39;t look very stable. Maybe move the tails just a wee bit more towards the axis. <BR> <BR>J, U and V look too wide, optically at least. <BR> <BR>The ampersand could do with more curves, no? It looks bolder than the rest now. Try it with a back like the &#34;3&#34;? <BR> <BR>I think the horizontal bars on the Euro and the Yen might be too thin. <BR> <BR>Just my two cents. <BR> <BR>When it&#39;s done be sure to tell us where to get it. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, your Polish <i>ew</i> &#40;Lslash&#41; is pretty good: the bar crosses the stem at just the right height and has a really good length. I would probably increase the angle off the horizontal just a bit more though. Since you&#39;ve done such a good job with this diacritic letter, I really encourage you to do the rest of the Polish letters and extend the languagre coverage for the central European, Baltic and Turkish character sets. I think you would have a lot of fun doing this, and would increase the value of the font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Karen, John, Yves et al. <BR> <BR>John: I&#39;m happy you like my <i>ew</i>.  I studied them for some time to figure out the positioning, but I agree about the angle. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d actually like to do not only more Latin language coverage, but perhaps some other scripts.  I&#39;ve already sketched out Thai letters, just to see how it might work.  From reading the threads here and at Typographica &#40;especially Hrant&#39;s comments&#41;, I gather it will be an interesting challenge to &#34;keep it real&#34; in other scripts, so to speak. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>
