  body: I'm still using Quark 6.0; they've gone beyond any useful functions as far
    as I'm concerned and not providing an incentive for me to update other than that
    I may have to open someone else's file created in a newer version. Not a big fan
    of InDesign - still seems way too clunky -- and could it require more memory?

    requests it.</em>\r\n\r\nI've never \"requested a feature\" because I'm not in
    the application design business.\r\nThe problems with OpenType implementation
    are far deeper than anything that can be solved by \"feature request\".\r\nI pointed
    out the shortcomings of InDesign's OpenType interface in an article I wrote in
    2002...\r\n\r\n\"InDesign has OpenType features buried on\r\na second-level pop-up
    menu, with attributes\r\nthat, confusingly, appear to duplicate those\r\non the
    \u201Cstyling\u201D menu.\"\r\n\r\n... the same shortcomings exist today, several
    versions later -- and it looks like they will continue to exist as long as the
    CS team apparently follows a method of product development more inclined to \"feature
    design by user committee\" than taking a leadership role in solving a fundamental
    interface design problem. \r\n\r\nOf course, user input through feature request
    is not without merit--but it doesn't seem to be working for OpenType.\r\n\r\n"

    There has been some good headway, but there is more to be done.\r\n\r\nA good
    chunk of Photoshop users would never ask for a glyph palette in PS. Certainly
    that doesn't mean there shouldn't be one."

    the lead in OpenType support because most users don\u2019t understand it well
    enough to request stuff.</cite>\r\n\r\nSome thoughts:\r\n\r\nIt is sad that even
    InDesign hides OT options behind an almost invisible little button. OT options
    are similarly hidden in Apple's applications. We have the strange situation that
    foundries must provide manuals which show how to use fonts in this or that application.\r\n\r\nAmusingly,
    it is XPress 7 whose button for OT options at least shows the blue-green italic
    OpenType 'O' icon.\r\n\r\nBut still, all these are special interest applications.\r\nI
    wonder if there might be unexpected help from another side. WPF has full OT support
    and seems to make it <cite>relatively</cite> easy to develop gadgets / widgets
    / applications. Maybe soon individual developers will come up with little apps
    which have OT support? (This were even more likely if Microsoft would provide
    standard UI elements for this.) The existence of their 'Downloads' platform indicates
    that Apple understood the relevance of hobby or small developers. Another aspect
    are efforts to bring WPF to OSX (Silverlight) and possibly even Unix (third party)
    -- one could rely on WPF without fear addressing a single platform only.\r\nIt
    is only by way of mass market applications that awareness of OpenType can increase.
    But that's thoughts only.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Color, Live Paint or nested styles. But something like this is obvious to you
    all, so it *is* appropriate to listen to actual users.\r\n\r\nIf none of you think
    it's worth using the request form, that's unfortunate. Somehow it is more gratifying
    for Nick to complain repeatedly about it on Typophile. Okay, whatever makes you
    happy.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
