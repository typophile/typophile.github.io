body: I&#39;m a long-time TeX &#40;on Linux&#41; user, new to the art of type design,
  but very interested in it. My first impression of the digital typography world as
  it exists today is that I&#39;m going to be as much a minority here as I am in the
  world of digital layout, by way of platform and software used---it seems dominated
  by the Apple and Microsoft OSes and the commercial software applications that run
  on these two OSes. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to figure out why the Metafont language
  is so apparently underused---is it an OS issue? <BR> <BR>It&#39;s confusing to me
  because Metafont seems like such a powerful tool for industrial application. If
  TeX is your compositing system it would seem to make sense to use Metafont, and
  it is free, and powerful---yet few designers use it, unless somehow I am missing
  something. But considering how long it has been available, there don&#39;t seem
  to be all that many metafonts around---according to the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/fonts-faq/metafont-list/">Metafont
  fonts list</a>, there are only 62 fonts in .mf format that are publicly available!
  <BR> <BR>Is it that Metafonts cannot be easily converted to Type 1 and other more
  popular formats, thus remain a niche for TeX users only? &#40;If so, can&#39;t a
  tool be written to successfully convert mf to Type 1/TTF formats?&#41; Is there
  some other great limitation to Metafont that would make it a waste of time to learn
  and master, or is it simply that most type designers prefer the &#34;visual sketching&#34;
  &#40;my term&#41; approach of the FontLab/TypeTool/Fontographer/Illustrator/etc
  method over the &#34;algorithmic programming&#34; method of Metafont?

  body: 'Michael,  <BR> <BR>Metafont can only produce bitmap fonts which is a severe
    limitation. Nowadays, people usually create outline fonts since they are scalable
    and usable in different resolutions. There are tools that convert .mf to Type
    1 or TrueType but this is done by autotracing which results in rather poor quality.  <BR>
    <BR>There is a related product called Metapost, created by John Hobby, which allows
    parametric creation of PostScript graphics. This was later extended by Boguslaw
    Jackowski, Piotr Strzelczyk and Janusz Nowacki to MetaType1, an outline-based
    parametric font creation system. However, just like many other parametric font
    creation systems &#40;e.g. Font Chameleon, Infinifont, LiveType&#41;, it never
    gained the necessary momentum. With no professional support and no solid user
    interface, the tools for creating these sorts of fonts were never able to reach
    a broad user base. Even Multiple Master fonts that had good user interface tools
    &#40;Fontographer, FontLab&#41; were dropped because handling them turned out
    to be too complicated and the revenues were too limited.  <BR> <BR>Developing
    mature applications is a long and laborous effort. The commercial market is difficult,
    which is visible with the fact that numerous efforts such as Fontographer, FontStudio
    , TypeDesigner or RoboFog &#34;died&#34;. The open source community is too weak
    to develop a good specialty tool of that sort &#40;open source projects work well
    with mass products such as Mozilla or OpenOffice, with hundreds of engineers working
    in their spare time or on government/organizational funding&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Today,
    with the exception of DTL FontMaster and FontForge &#40;which is free&#41;, FontLab
    is the only font creation application that is actively being developed. First
    version of FontLab was created 12 years ago and in that process, we have learned
    that a good user interface is crucial to a success.  <BR> <BR>Font creators are
    mostly designers, not engineers. They need visual tools. Also, type is often too
    subtle to rely on parametric creation. While it would be tempting to re-use the
    exactly same shape of a serif on n, m, i and l, often, subtle changes need to
    be made for best effect. The more subtle and refined the letterforms get, the
    less the parametric approach is useful. Donald Knuth&#39;s Computer Modern isn&#39;t
    a particularly well-designed typeface and frankly, I have never seen a good typeface
    made with Metafont.  <BR> <BR>When people make a profession out of creating type,
    i.e. they make their living on type design, the issue of a tool being free becomes
    less relevant. Also, tools such as Metafont are only nominally free. There are
    no licensing costs but there are substantial costs of maintenance, support and
    learning. The learning curves are steep, the user communities are small and not
    integrated, there is no professional support. Therefore, if you work with tools
    such as Metafont, you&#39;re often left on your own. This is a fact often overlooked
    by those who advertise free or open source software.  <BR> <BR>There is a good
    selection of links about parametric font creation at:  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/activity/parametric-fonts/"

  body: Many type designers come into type design via the world of Graphic Design,
    which is more visual than not. Before beginning to draw letters, many of us were
    already fluent in vector applications like Illustrator and Freehand. Because of
    this, I personally view something like Metafont as having too steep of a learning
    curve. Besides, I don&#39;t see what benefit it would bring. <BR> <BR>Also, it
    may be noble that Metafont is a free standard, but I would rather support companies
    like FontLab, who I also think is noble even though it is a commercial entity.  <BR>
    <BR>The same goes for Apple, actually. I haven&#39;t ever had any doubts about
    shelling out the higher prices necessary for their hardware and software. I feel
    like I&#39;m getting good value for my investment. I also learned design on Macs
    in the early 1990s, and can remember a time &#40;even though I was just a teenager&#41;
    where there was still alot, design-wise, that one couldn&#39;t do as well on a
    PC. Apple and the modern graphic design industry built each other up. Almost symbiotically,
    if you will. I have never used TeX, and doen&#39;t know of very many designers
    who do. <BR> <BR>You are certainly welcome to design with Metafont. I&#39;ll bet
    that you can even get tips and support here on Typophile! But it isn&#39;t the
    direction that the industry seems to be going in &#40;or has been going in for
    a decade and a half&#41;. <BR> <BR>FontLab, especially when used in conjunction
    with Python scripting, is a rather powerful tool as well. But I don&#39;t have
    the requisite knowledge necessary to make a comparison between its capabilities
    and Metafont&#39;s.

  body: Why does nobody use Metafont? FWIW, I reckon the main reasons are:<ul><li>Metafont
    programming is difficult; <LI>Metafonts can&#39;t be converted to Type1 or TrueType,
    so they can only be used with TeX; <LI>&#40;Related to the above&#41; Metafonts
    can&#39;t be sensibly embedded in PostScript or PDF files so that they look good
    on screen.</li></ul> <BR>Actually I tend to regard Metafont as an interesting
    failed experiment. The original idea, that a family of type could be constructed
    by essentially mechanical means from a single source, turned out to be much too
    naive &#40;as the Metafonters discovered when they got Zapf&#39;s drawings for
    Euler, and saw that the bold glyphs were not simply the regular ones with thicker
    strokes!&#41; <BR> <BR>In Knuth&#39;s original AMS article on typesetting, he
    appears to imagine that one could discover a precise mathematical description
    capturing the Platonic essence of each glyph, and that different typefaces could
    then be instantiated by setting appropriate parameters. <BR> <BR>All that said,
    it would be very interesting to see what an expert tech-savvy type designer could
    do with the framework. It&#39;s clearly a very bad way to digitise existing designs,
    but I&#39;m sure something novel and interesting could be made by taking its strengths
    and limitations into account. Sadly there is no real incentive for such a person
    to try, until somebody works out a way to convert the result into a font format
    that could reasonably be offered for sale.

  body: Please be kind, this is my first posting here. <BR> <BR>I have used MetaFont
    for around a year now, and there are a few misconceptions.  Indeed, MetaFont is
    a programming language &#40;which is, BTW, well-documented in the MetaFontBook
    by Knuth&#41; and there are relatively few fonts for it.  However, with the use
    of other utilites include a lovely little utility called MFtrace and FontForge,
    it is possible to create a complete family as any FontForge format &#40;TTF, OTF,
    PFA, etc.&#41;.  For further information on tracing of MetaFonts, look at the
    Lilypond project &#40; lilypond.org &#41;. <BR> <BR>If anyone is interested, I
    can post some of my MetaFont work &#40;it&#39;s not great, but it might give an
    idea&#41;. <BR> <BR>Adam, I just now noticed that you mentioned autotracing.  It
    is worth a look at Lilypond to judge its quality yourself. <BR> <BR>-ray_theray

  body: Metafont was mind-blowingly advanced when it was first developed &#40;most
    people forget how much of a debt digital typography today owes to MF and TeX&#41;,
    but the real problem is that it has gotten hardly a whit of new development since
    John Hobby graduated and moved on. The lack of <i>any</i> sort of GUI is an absolute
    killer, and the lack of good export to widely used outline formats also hurts
    deeply. <BR> <BR>Both problems could be addressed, but haven&#39;t. I consider
    autotracing of bitmaps to be a bandaid rather than a practical solution for working
    type designers. A proper conversion requires the ability to compute offset curves
    and boolean operations in cubic Bezier space, which is pretty much rocket science
    &#40;as it happens, you also need both of these operations to emulate Benton optical
    scaling, so it&#39;s likely I&#39;ll write and release code, at least for the
    primitives&#41;. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t done enough actual work in Metafont or
    FontLab &#40;with its Python scripting hooks&#41;, but I have read the relevant
    documentation for both, and suspect that the latter has in fact come close to
    replicating what Metafont had almost twenty years ago. Of course, this time around
    there&#39;s a decent UI and a viable support community, which is, as Adam points
    out, much more important than pure technical achievement. <BR> <BR>Metafont and
    FontForge may be &#34;only nominally free&#34; in the sense of money changing
    hands, but freedom in the sense of free software is a different beast altogether.
    One of the main advantages is that, for all its weaknesses and the difficulty
    of climbing a learning curve, it won&#39;t die just because its creators go out
    of business. Of course, without a viable community around the software, that&#39;s
    more of a theoretical than a practical advantage, sigh.

  body: I can definitely agree with that.  MF does indeed lack new development &#40;with
    perhaps the exception of Omega, which itself only has slightly more interest&#41;.  As
    a programming curiousity which appeals to those who can &#34;procedurally&#34;
    produce fonts &#40;like CMR or Lilypond&#41;, MF is useful. <BR> <BR>I will also
    add, as an amateur font enthusiast, many people in this community will have a
    greater insight into good and bad font design &#40;including things like autotracing&#41;
    than I.  I appreciate your very objective and well-defended arguments.  Perhaps
    I might even snag a look at some modern font utilities ;-&#41;

  body: 'Jacob,  <BR> <BR>for anybody interested in creating parametric fonts using
    the MetaFont paradigm, I recommend looking at MetaType1. It is a package developed
    by Boguslaw Jackowski, Piotr Strzelczyk and Janusz Nowacki, with some recent support
    from Johannes Kuester. It is based on MetaPost by John Hobby. MetaPost uses a
    similar concept as MetaFont, but its output is PostScript code &#40;real outlines&#41;,
    not bitmaps. MetaType1 turns this arbitraty PostScript code into Type 1 code,
    also allowing adding hints and other font-only related information.  <BR> <BR>MetaType1
    was presented on several TeX conferences:  <BR><a href="http://www.ntg.nl/maps/pdf/26_15.pdf"

    &#40;slides&#41; <BR> <BR>The big difference between MetaPost&#43;MetaType1 and
    MetaFont&#43;MFtrace is that using MetaPost&#43;MetaType1, you don&#39;t do autotracing
    but work on actual high-quality outlines all the time. MetaType1 has been used
    to create or extens several fonts, most of them available free of charge from:

  body: "coming too late, but I have to say something about. The reason why MF has
    not taken off is explaned by Knuth himself: \"asking an artist to become enough
    of a mathematician to understand how to write a font with 60 parameters is too
    much.\".\r\nMF is a totally different, not visual, approach to font creation.
    And nowadays the visual approach, the WYSIWYG is mostly preferred.\r\nThere are
    some misconception I would like to correct.\r\nMF output is bitmap. Exactly in
    the same way all scalable vector graphics is bitmap once \"produced\" and displayed
    or printed. But usually you don't see the process and the file describing the
    font is considered the \"final\" resource. The Metafont source(s) for a well designed
    font should be considered the same way and so Metafont source(s) is the \"final\"
    resource and the font is scalable (provided it is well programmed).\r\nIf you
    don't know the resolution of the target device where your text will be displayed,
    you have to distribute the MF files - altogether with the document that is going
    to use that font and metrics tfm files.\r\nSo a correct setup and software combination
    can produce high quality \"texts\" for any device at any resolution (don't forget
    the files original TeX produce are called \".dvi\" that is DeVice Independet:
    the only device dependent part is the font itself!).\r\nThe problem is that for
    sure such a system is not good for desktop displays, nor for web. It could be
    good for typography, having well designed fonts (and as said it is hard to design
    fonts this way, harder than using a graphical approach), but there are other \"problems\",
    for example it is surely faster to \"convert\" a ttf glyph into bitmap to display
    (there could be even some sort of hardware aid!) than generating the whole \"metafont\"
    bitmap fonts at the needed resolution.\r\n\r\nAnother note: most of you when you
    say \"parametric\" seem to think about font parameters you can change programmatically.
    Indeed, the whole design of your font can be parametric, helping you to give consistency
    to a family and also to obtain rther different fonts from the very same source. "
