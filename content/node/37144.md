  body: "Scott. This does indeed look like an font. But, there\u2019s so many of these
    vectorized handwriting fonts out there (mostly freeware) that this turns out to
    be searching for a needle in a haystack (german saying). I suggest you browse
    through the handwritten font categories at freefont sites (dafont for example)."
