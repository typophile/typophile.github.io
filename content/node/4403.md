  looking at Walbaum from Storm. Doesn&#39;t seem to be a huge family, but the characters
  seem really solid, pure, straightforward. Your thoughts?&#60;/font&#62;

    Storm&#39;s Walbaum? <BR>

    I was slobbering over the Storm release Andulka this morning, but it&#39;s...
    too sharp/angular if that makes any sense. Maybe the softness of Walbaum is what

  body: 'Dylan -- <BR> <BR>Thanks for your private message asking about a sans complement
    for Whitman. I&#39;m pleased that you&#39;re considering it. I thought I&#39;d
    reply on the forum, since I get this question frequently. <BR> <BR>Pairing sans
    and serif is, I think, one of the most basic ways to create a sense of typographic
    style; and as such, it can be very much a matter of personal taste. So, don&#39;t
    take anything I say about this with any more weight than anyone else just because
    I designed Whitman.  <BR> <BR>Nevertheless, here are some pairings that I&#39;ve
    seen or tried myself: <BR> <BR>Will Powers paired Whitman with Franklin Gothic
    Condensed in a book he did for MnHS Press. In general, I think anything along
    these lines -- Franklin Gothic, FB&#39;s Benton Gothic/Sans, Nick Shinn&#39;s
    Brown Gothic -- makes a solid companion. <BR> <BR>In my own work, I&#39;ve paired
    Whitman with Vectora -- one of my favorite sans. It&#39;s a tricky combo if you
    mix them in line, since the x-heights are vastly different. But I like the forms
    together. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on a how-to book right now for which I&#39;m
    using Whitman paired with Gotham. I rather like it. I&#39;ve also seen this combo
    used pretty well in a small startup magazine called <i>Revenue.</i> <BR> <BR><i>The
    Virginia Quarterly Review</i> pairs Whitman with Bliss to great success. <BR>
    <BR>A more unusual combo is Whitman with Cyrus Highsmith&#39;s Relay, used by
    a Finnish young women&#39;s style magazine, <i>Trendi</i>. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also
    wanted to try pairing Whitman with FF Kievit. I think the neutrality of both would
    make a nice combination where transparency is desired. But I haven&#39;t found
    the right opportunity yet. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/34154.gif"

    behaves well and performs to your expectations. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, if you
    are still working in Quark, I have customized suitcases that I&#39;d be happy
    to give you. They are modified to allow Quark to do its auto fi- and fl-lig substitution.
    They are also combined into two suitcases -- one for LF and the other for OsF
    -- and are style-linked for Bold and Italic.  <BR> <BR>Let me know and I&#39;ll
    send you copies. <BR> <BR>&#40;That&#39;s one downside of the FB model which allows
    you to purchase individual styles and weights -- it means that you get delivered
    all these individual suitcases. As opposed to the very nicely combined and linked
    families from HTF, for instance.&#41; <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re working in InDesign,
    then it&#39;s moot -- Indy will do f-lig subs anyway &#40;but not the ff-ligs,
    because they&#39;re nonstandard FB encoding&#41;. And style-linking is screwed

  body: '<i>&#62;This style-linking issue - I&#39;m not aware of it, but I&#39;m curious.</i>
    <BR> <BR>In Indy, you can only style type italic or bold &#40;i.e., from the keyboard&#41;
    when there is an actual designed version. This is, in general, a good thing --
    no faked obliques or smeared bolds. <BR> <BR>But the bug is that with nonstandard
    family structures, Indy makes some weird decisions. So, for instance, with Whitman,
    if you&#39;re working with text in RomanOsF and then style a word to italic, Indy
    will make it ItalicLF. Then if you unstyle it by repeating the italic command,
    you&#39;ll get RomanLF. Or, under certain circumstances, you&#39;ll go back to
    SmallCapsLF. This sort of thing. <BR> <BR>I seem to remember that which fonts
    change to which varies depending upon how you have your fonts loaded &#40;font
    management vs. system vs. Adobe app folders&#41;. Mark Record &#40;FB tech guy&#41;
    and I spent a bit of time trying to troubleshoot this until we finally realized
    it was a bug that we couldn&#39;t do anything about. <BR> <BR>And it&#39;s not
    just Whitman. I experienced the same problem with Frutiger &#40;from Adobe&#41;.
    IIRC, Frutiger 45 &#40;Light&#41; went to 56 &#40;Italic&#41;, then back to 55
    &#40;Roman&#41; -- or something similar.  <BR> <BR>Bottom-line: the style-linking
    is screwy. Which is a pain for someone who does a lot of formatting from the keyboard
    or with tagged text. <BR> <BR>Thomas, glad to hear it&#39;s better in CS. I&#39;ll
    have to upgrade one of these days &#40;just too lazy&#41; and try it out. <BR>
