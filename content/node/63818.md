  make any alterations to it.\r\n\r\nMy main concern is the font used for the name/number/e-mail\r\nDo
  you have any suggestions?\r\nAll feedback is appreciated!\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nRenata.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Graphic1_3839.jpg]"

  body: "First thing, if they're a environmental consulting firm, I would replace
    the grey background with something less industrial and more \"natural\".\r\nAs
    for the type, you could try a serif (or, maybe, a light slab), in order to differentiate
    from the wordmark's typeface."

  body: "The preview I see of your image has a monospaced font for the name/number/email.
    I wouldn't use it because it hampers the readability. The kerning just looks messy.\r\nI
    would try something that is perhaps narrow or condenesed to start with so it relates
    to the tagline of the logo. Consistency is a good thing.\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"
