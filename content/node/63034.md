  body: "I often see requests that people \"use descriptive titles.\" \r\n\r\nI have
    two problems with this. First, a lot of the font ID requests are from people who
    are new to the site and they don't know the rules. Second, as intuitive as it
    feels to veteran typophiles, using descriptive titles isn't at the forefront of
    everyone's minds. Thankfully Typophile.com was designed well and is highly usable.
    So there's really no need to visit a FAQ section before submitting one's rookie
    forum post. \r\n\r\nWhy not post a note at the top of the Type ID Board? Is the
    plan to try to educate people one at a time after the fact?\r\n\r\nSorry, but
    pointing out the FAQ on descriptive titles often comes across as a way to shame
    or embarrass people. My personal opinion: Learn to live with the fact that people
    won't use descriptive titles. OR, make the request to use descriptive titles more
    prominent. "

    make things easier for us type-IDers (and ID-seekers using the search). But I
    can assure you, we don\u2019t ask for this to embarrass people or to make them
    feel stupid."

  body: "I completely understand the reason for the request. I'm not saying it's purposely
    done to embarrass people. Just saying it can come across that way, especially
    to new Typophiles. \r\n\r\nMy point is that it could help everyone if it was made
    more apparent that descriptive ID's were recommended.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in (or near)
    the \"Subject\" input field there could be some text like: \"Using descriptive
    subject titles will help the Typophile community efficiently search for your post
    in the future.\"\r\n\r\nMight reduce the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome for typophiles.

  body: "1) The netiquette demands to first visit the FAQ. On every forum. \r\n\r\n2)
    We don't want to embarass people by referring to the FAQ. It just is a way to
    avoid \xBBStuff happens\xAB or \xBBType ID\xAB. \r\n\r\n3) And finally identifying
    type isn't always done in 15 seconds. Sometimes it needs hours and days. And how
    to find a thread, when each title is called \xBBType ID please\xAB?\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Oops, sorry dind't refresh. Yes, it would be helpful if there would be a sticky
    at every new topic which tells about the basic things \u2026"

  body: "I'm in favor of any idea that helps new users follow the rules.\r\n\r\nOn
    top of that maybe we should just add another rule for type-IDers to ignore ID
    requests without a descriptive title?\r\n\r\nRenko is right... some type IDs take
    a ton of time and it seems only a small group attempt to help others in this regard.
    I'm personally getting tired of all the leeches who create a new account only
    to request an ID without bothering to read the forum rules, identify it first
    on their own or overview where they've specifically searched. More frustrating
    are those who are never heard from again after getting what they want."
