  and I do love to read and study everything type related.\r\n\r\nI am now in a bit
  of a dilemma:\r\nA company has contacted me, because they want to use one of my
  handwritten fonts for their marketing materials. For this, they need support for
  hungarian, czech, and polish characters, which should not be too hard a problem
  to add to my font.\r\nHowever, they also want support for cyrillic characters.\r\n\r\nI'm
  afraid of getting in over my head trying to accomodate this last request, as I really
  know nothing about Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nDo you think this is doable for a novice typographer?
  I'm willing to put in study and effort, but can I get good results with reasonable
  effort?  Or is it better to refer them to someone who can do a more professional
  job of it?"

  body: "It's doable but hard - for a contextual handwriting font we had made a few
    years ago, we had the type designer who's handwriting formed the basis of the
    Latin study many Cyrillic and Greek handwriting samples, and basically learnt
    to write cursive Cyrillic - we had experts review the output and several rounds
    of refinements were needed. \r\n\r\nIncidentally for the Greek it was a bit easier
    as cursive Greek doesn\u2019t tend to have a lot of joining characters. As I recall
    the initial feedback was that it looked like \u201CSchoolboy Greek\u201D, so that
    too required a few more rounds of refinement.\r\n\r\nWe did a TypeCon workshop
    on this - contact me off-list and I'll see if I caa dig up the PDF.\r\n\r\nAs
    an alternative you could look at existing Cyrillic handwriting fonts (Paratype
    has a few) and recommend one that works well with your Latins. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "If your handwriting font isn't of the cursive, joined variety, that should
    make the job much simpler since you don't have to worry too much about contextual
    alternates.\r\n\r\nYou can either study a lot of Cyrillic handwriting samples
    and teach yourself to write Cyrillic, as Sii mentioned, or work with a collaborator
    who knows Cyrillic design. People often hire consultants or additional designers
    for extension of existing fonts into Cyrillic or Greek, so there are a number
    of experts around who can help. You can also use the critique forum here.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I would recommend at least studying how to write Cyrillic first even if you end
    up using professional help later. You'll find it really helpful and hopefully
    enjoyable."

    leaning towards not taking this, at least not on my own. I think there's a big
    risk that the result will be less than acceptable.\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend
    someone who might be able to take on a project such as this?"
