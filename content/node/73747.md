  in order to find the roads less travelled myself. Thinking about this got me curious
  about the possible future trends in the world of magazine typography. So I am starting
  this thread for both fun and inspiration, as I am thinking there might be some inspiring
  and/or informed views present here.\r\n\r\nI think it is a fair, although maybe
  a bit bold guess that in the near future we will see less of these past and current
  trends:\r\n\r\n* extremely thin slab serifs\r\n* extremely thin sans serifs\r\n*
  didones (if it is even possible to move away from this)\r\n* friendly and rounded
  slab serifs\r\n* painfully narrow and tall sans serifs\r\n\r\nThe last two will
  probably go on for some while though.\r\n\r\nBut what do you think we will see more
  of in the coming two to three years?"

    really depends on whether or not the magazine industry decides the current crop
    of popular styles is working or if they decide that they need a dramatic break.
    Either way I think that more art directors will commission bespoke type and use
    optical sizes to make their printed magazines look better and more important so
    that people feel like buying them."

    books, newspapers and magazines will gradually decline in popularity over the
    coming years. \r\n\r\nFrom today's New York Times:\r\n\"By the end of this year,
    10.3 million people are expected to own e-readers in the United States, buying
    about 100 million e-books, the market research company Forrester predicts. This
    is up from 3.7 million e-readers and 30 million e-books sold last year. The trend
    is wreaking havoc inside the publishing industry...\""

    trend. People will still look for the fully satisfying browsing experience of
    a printed magazine, smell of paper, shiny ink and all. But the magazine that people
    take to bed at night has to have something special. Custom made typefaces, better
    typography all and all, special paper choices and so on - exclusivity I guess,
    will probably be one the rising trends. How it turns into a profitable business
    model, I don't know. Monocle pioneered in this quite nicely, but I would be surprised
    if they are making any profit out of it.\r\n\r\n"

    as it is about the individual faces chosen. \r\n\r\nThe trend I see gaining strength
    is a sort of \"Victorian poster meets 1950's tool catalog\" approach, characterized
    by the gleeful mix of sturdy faces regardless of provenance, with multiple sanses,
    serifs and slabs tossed into the mix. See recent issues of the U.S. editions of
    Wired (especially the Will Farrell/Future issue) or the front-of-the-book sections
    in GQ as examples. (The late Portfolio mag and the much-missed Blueprint were
    more refined antecedents.)\r\n\r\nKent makes a great point, too. Want to start
    a design trend? Find a dusty typeface that bores/repulses you and find a way to
    make it fresh. Arnold Bocklin will have its day..."

    so much exclusivity as craft made obvious. Only the rare magazines that offer
    top-tier writing like The New Yorker and The Economist can get away with letting
    style take a quiet backseat to content. Other art directors will really need to
    start celebrating their existence. I think that the redesign of O (the Oprah magazine)
    is an example of how really great design can make a proletarian magazine stand
    out in the crowd. It\u2019s a sort of balancing act between showing off the design
    without being ham-handed or overly intellectual as postmodern design sometimes
    was."

    rather than trying to predict what will be <em>trendy</em> in the future, a meaningful
    contribution to the discussion could be made by identifying trends that have run
    their course in the past ten\u2013twenty years or so. That may help us identify
    trends that are still trending; and, optimistically, to what these point."

    I do like the idea of the \"Victorian poster meets 1950's tool catalog\" -- putting

  body: "The article Nick Shinn linked to was very interesting. It is of course impossible
    to predict the future, and I hope it came trough from my post that I was merely
    looking for a little play around different ideas, and this should not to be taken
    too seriously. But I am definitely interested in your intuition, the quality I
    also very much believe in, as one has to. Even if it isn't such a good tool for
    predicting the future, like Duncan Watts goes to prove.\r\n\r\nI agree with Nick
    that there are indeed <cite>certain value judgements about which magazines are
    important and, indeed, influential.</cite> That plays a role in a smaller market
    area like mine. I can easily recognize the international magazines and font foundries
    that seem to have quite a big influence here - at least for now. Somebody gets
    inspired first, the others follow - it can get extremely conformist. But of course,
    rather than new trends, they often seem to be the last waves of something that
    started a while ago, most often in the States.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the big and influential
    magazines do not change their design that often. I think one gets pretty lost
    trying to predict the future based on their choices. And of course on that level,
    it also gets much less experimental. I will go with what James said: <cite>Fashion
    mags will always use didones, women's mags will always use ultra thin sans, this
    you can be sure of.</cite> \r\n\r\nI find small independently run magazines, that
    do not need to conform to any genre expectations or commercial pressure, to be
    the most inspiring or at least refreshing to look at.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned that
    I am working on something now, I should probably point out that this project is
    not going to be very trendy at all, rather the opposite. So I am not here to pick
    your brain. I am just curious to hear your predictions, serious or not."

    and compete with the constant reinvention of the Web (and/or their own digital
    incarnations). Complete design overhauls, which used to happen every 3-5 years,
    now take place every couple of years. Also, the two magazines I cited, GQ and
    Wired (which are certainly big and influential in U.S. editorial circles) are
    in a perpetual state of redesign -- typefaces drift in and out of favor, and feature
    stories look entirely different from similar articles in previous issues. "
