    using I might be able to help you interpret the license.

  body: Thanks! I haven't decided on fonts yet. It will be several. Probably common
    ones, like Times New Roman, Helvetica, something from Adobe... But I'm somewhat
    flexible. Is there something I should be looking for in the license?

    your position... I want to laser cut the outline of Akkurat for say... a furniture

    do it. Is this what you mean?\r\n\r\nSorry if Im being slow. Long day.\r\n\r\n__\r\nRez\r\n"

    issues are there that would effect this?</em>\r\n\r\nIt would depend on the foundry
    and their EULA. That is the contract between the foundry and the user. \r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me in general, that wall signage, alphabets made as stickers or the letterforms
    themselves as the object being resold with the font design being the only distinguishing
    factor from raw material (or unsellable without the font design): is a case of
    the type design being translated into another media and in need of additional
    licensing. The type design in .ttf, .otf, rub down transfer, or personal die cutting
    system is still the same type design, just another media.\r\n\r\nIf the commercial
    product being sold was a teak chair with a name engraved into the backrest, then
    the item being sold is not the font but the chair. The font is not the \"selling\"
    component of the chair but rather an incidental component."
