body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nOur users are experiencing a very discouraging issue in regards
  to how MS Word (in Windows) handles non-unicode characters. This issue is confirmed
  in both Word 2007 and the Word 2010 Beta using Windows XP SP3; I suspect it works
  the same way in 2003.\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\n1) A user creates a document using a non-unicode
  font, entering characters to represent scientific notations. For example, he enters
  a Mu (\xB5). Note: I pasted in a unicode-compliant Mu for reference.\r\n2) The user
  opens his document and attempts to copy / paste this non-unicode character representing
  a Mu into a web browser for entry into our system. It pastes as an unrecognized
  character. This is expected.\r\n3) The user opens his document, selects the non-unicode
  character and adjusts its font to \"Arial Unicode MS,\" saving the document. He
  closes / re-opens the document for good measure. Once re-opened, he copies what
  should be a unicode Mu and pastes it into the web browser. It is still represented
  as an unrecognized character.\r\n4) The user creates a new document, sets the font
  to \"Arial Unciode MS\" and creates a Mu. He copies this Mu into the web browser
  and it pastes over in Unicode, as expected.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nWord is not actually
  converting non-unicode characters into unicode characters when it should, when a
  unicode font is selected. Instead, it is taking a best-guess for display reasons
  but doing no actual conversion.\r\n\r\nHow do I overcome this problem?\r\n* Can
  I change some setting in Word to force a conversion? Preferable.\r\n* Is there a
  \"cleaner\" app or Word macro that will do this?\r\n* Other solutions?\r\n\r\nAdditional
  Notes:\r\n* Re-typing the affected documents using unicode is not an option\r\n*
  This is not an issue in Mac OS X using the most recent version of Word. A sample
  case such as in (3) results in a unicode Mu being pasted into the browser.\r\n\r\nPlease
  help!"

    has glyphs that differ from the typical representation of the character indicated
    by the Ansi and Unicode number. If, for instance, the Greek lower-case mu is not
    at 181 in Ansi, then Word will not display a glyph that looks like a mu. Word
    does not do conversions since at the the latest Word 2000. It simply selects the
    glyph corresponding to the Ansi or Unicode code point in the particular font you
    are using. It is often the case with pre-OpenType fonts that the glyphs selected
    are simply those that suit the font designers fancy and for perfectly legitimate
    reasons."
