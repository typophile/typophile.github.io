  belong to the same family but it's not working that way and I can't figure what
  I'm doing wrong, any tips? I've used the same naming structure in another font and
  it worked just fine but on this one it isn't working, it displays both styles in
  different families.\r\n\r\nI've attached the images of the settings of each style.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

    at the bottom, right next to the yin-yang symbol? That should have put \"italic\"
    in the rest of the fields.\r\n\r\nAlso make sure \"Additional OpenType names\"
    has been reset..."

    this problem, after trying everything that was really the issue haha.\r\n\r\nThanks
    malcolm, I wouldn't figure that by myself anytime soon, seems it's working fine
    now!"
