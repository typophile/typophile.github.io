  I uncheck the \"shrink text to fit\" box.)\r\n\r\nWhy does copy/paste not retain
  basic stuff like font attributes (size, color, font even)?\r\n\r\nWhy is everything
  positioned relatively (and not with coordinates or measurements)?\r\n\r\nPowerPoint
  is the anti-typography.\r\n\r\nSrsly."

  body: 'Responded to this thread on twitter - the holy anti-typography trinity is
    Powerpoint, Publisher and Word. I''m often asked to "customize"  powerpoint templates
    from these other two programs (read: make something that doesn''t look like a
    canned ''theme,'' but is in a program that the user can still mess up by picking
    "pretty fonts."). Each time I simply open one of the three I hear a microsoft
    programmer''s horns grow an inch. '

  body: Powerpoint insists on capitalizing the first letter of the first word, every
    time you put a word in a text box. Treat me with some respect. If I want to write
    a Powerpoint in LOLspeak your software should let me.

    using coordinates/inches.\r\n\r\nIf you select an object and Ctrl+click/right
    click, and choose Format Shape, you can move and item down to the hundredth of
    an inch. If you set the \"origin\" to the top left corner, that will give you
    a de facto coordinate system.\r\n\r\nHelpful?\r\n\r\njarrod"
