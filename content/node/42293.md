body: "I have a beautifully typeset collection of poetry by Yeats, selected by Seamus
  Heaney (London: Faber & Faber, 2000).  The typeface appears different from some
  of the other books in the series.  Unfortunately, I only have a picture of the cover,
  but maybe some helpful characteristics include: the 3, 4, 5, 7, & 9 are lowered;
  the apostrophe is thin with a lot of arc.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/71ESFHAP46L__SS500__5249.jpg]"

  body: And the descending angle at the head of the lower-case 't' is straight but
    does not run continuously into the left arm, there is a right-angle 'notch' cut
    into it.
