  fonts are designed by me. The font has completed 6763 characters.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/22334.jpg\r\n
  \r\nWhile I was using the  contracting lor  function of 'Bold' of 'Transform' of
  AsiaFont Studio 4, there was a problem:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.douban.com/photos/photo/544307011/#next_photo\r\n\r\nsome
  straight line becomes curves, and some parts are not reasonably transformed. May
  you kindly tackle my problem?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.douban.com/photos/photo/544307201/#next_photo\r\n\r\nalthough
  the function of 'to lines' of 'convert' could transform curves into straight lines,
  but have to do it one by one.... so are there any ways that could convert a batch
  of lines?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.douban.com/photos/photo/544307365/#next_photo"
