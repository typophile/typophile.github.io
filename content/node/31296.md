  allows embedding. as far as i remembered bitstream's vera was a good choice, but
  when i try to embedd it (in adobe designer) it gives me the message that vera's
  font license does not allow embedding?!\r\n\r\ni'm looking for at least 2 faces
  because i'm doing business forms design which need dynamic contents (pre-filled
  by the system and/or the user), so i need a least a regular and bold face :)\r\n\r\nany
  further suggestion for an alternative to vera?\r\n\r\nthanks: lars"

    Bitstream Vera Sans' <cite>Embedding</cite> field shows as blank for me, DejaVu
    Sans' <cite>Embedding</cite> field correctly shows as <cite>Installable embedding

    updated every month."

    techncially narrows the choice to 'editable' or 'installable' embedding (Print
    and preview won't cut it), and perhaps is why you're having difficulty locating
    fonts. Having said that, if you find a free font you like, I can't see why the
    creator wouldn't be willing to set the font to editable if you were to ask - probably
    something they just overlooked. "
