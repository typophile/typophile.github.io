  body: "Is that a standing corporation? As in stationary? It should be <cite>stationery</cite>,
    as in:\r\nMiddle English staciouner, a bookseller, from Medieval Latin statinrius,
    shopkeeper (as against a peddler), probably from Latin stati, statin-, place of
    business. (http://www.bartleby.com/61/92/S0719200.html)\r\n\r\nA frequent mistake,
    almost as frequent as spelling <cite>seperate</cite>, rather than <cite>separate</cite>.
    Latin <cite>separare</cite>, to divide (no source, just my memory).\r\n\r\nSometimes
    it is easier to look in from the outside. My native language is German."
