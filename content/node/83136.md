body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nCould someone let me know why symmetrical letters (A, V, etc.) don't
  have a perfect symmetrical form. Is there a particular reason why the angles and
  thickness of the two strokes in each letter vary?\r\n\r\nI've attached references
  for this. The blue filled part represents the original letter, and the red outlined
  form is the flipped version.\r\n\r\nAlso is it wrong for the letters to have a perfectly
  symmetrical form?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSulekha"

  body: My guess is that none of those weights was a master font and they all have
    uncorrected one-unit rounding errors as a result of interpolation. It's fairly
    common in type families and usually such errors can only be seen by someone who
    is measuring for them. Either that or the symmetric versions you created were
    made in a tool that does not round all points to integers and your new points
    are sitting on fractional coordinates.
