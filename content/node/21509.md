body: "Can anyone advise on the problems with Euro signs in Quark I'm having?\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure this is a well known issue but I'm really looking for a succinct explanation
  of why it happens.\r\n\r\nI'm using Quark 4.11 on a PC; the Euro sign displays OK
  on screen and prints OK to a non-Postscript printer; however it turns into a square
  on a Postscript printer or PDF output.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused as I understand
  this to be a Unicode character and therefore didn't expect it to be supported at
  all.\r\n\r\nI am in house and therefore use proprietary fonts most of the time;
  in this case the Euro sign is definitely in the 20AC Unicode position. The problem
  didn't previously occur as the previous set of fonts we used had an additional Euro
  sign in the 00A4 position.\r\n\r\nAny assistance appreciated.\r\n\r\nElliot\r\n"
