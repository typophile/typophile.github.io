  body: i don&#39;t think it&#39;s carson. we all know i&#39;m no expert,  <BR>but
    i think he would have used &#34;then&#34; rather then &#34;than&#34;.  <BR>that
    k is so... kinky.and scary. i just put a few of the  <BR>letters through whatthefont
    and got nothing.  <BR>anyone else have any leads? i&#39;m very curious now. <BR>
    <BR>does the new picture make everyone feel better? <BR>i acquired a rooster to
    emulate mr. coles. maybe <BR>now i&#39;ll be able to i.d. obscure faces. maybe.

  body: 'I think it <i>IS</i> Carson, I&#39;ve seen both the typefaces and the ad
    before, and if I remember it correctly it was related to Carson. Finding the type
    won&#39;t be easy though: David uses a couple of proprietary faces. I know for
    a fact I&#39;ve come across the serif with its typical lc &#34;k&#34;, maybe at
    Garage Fonts or [T-26]. Can&#39;t do much for the moment because my Carson books
    and my Garage Fonts catalogue are at home, but I&#39;ll try to hunt &#39;em down.

    it has some very characteristic &#34;Downerisms&#34; in its design. Some parts
    have a hint of <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=130"> Vendetta</a> to
    them. John Downer is IMHO the best thing to have happened to <a href="http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=141">

    something that will hold up well after being photocopied several times. It always
    looks great. It even faxes well.

  body: I have a problem with Vendetta&#39;s design methodology, but the <i>results</i>
    are indeed worthwhile. On the other hand, it really needs at least 3 optical sizes
    for its &#34;segmentation&#34; to have good effect at more than just large sizes.
    With just one size, the atmosphere the face conveys is too inconsistent at different
    sizes. If you look at the small sizes of metal Mistral for example, you&#39;ll
    see the letters are <i>much</i> rougher in outline. But Excoffon was Excoffon.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, I once wrote an pretty long review of Vendetta for typereview.com,
    but that site has been shut down. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
