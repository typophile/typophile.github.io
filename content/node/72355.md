  body: John Downer is right, MyFonts is the Wal-Mart of type. We just have to groan
    and smile when the deposits go through.

  body: I totally agree that myfonts is the Wal-Mart of type, but the Myfonts.com
    website is just so much better than fontfont.com and the alikes.

  body: "Myfonts is the market square of type and is largely responsible for the existence
    of hundreds of independent foundries, many of which do not have direct retail
    sales.\r\n\r\nI don't know when John Downer made that comment, but I suspect it
    was before Emigre fonts (his publisher) were distributed by MyFonts.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're criticizing a distributor for a manufacturer's ad copy, you have absolutely
    no understanding of how retail commerce works."

  body: Right, Nick. MyFonts is more like the farmer's market of type. Pretty much
    anyone can bring along their produce, rent a table, and sell what they have. The
    seller, not the market organiser, is ultimately responsible for labelling the
    chard as kale.

  body: If MyFonts were like Wal-Mart, they would be telling big companies like ITC
    things like, "We want you to make some changes to Avant Garde and Futura. The
    t's of all sans sold through us need to have a tail." And ITC would <em>do it.</em>
    Because if they want to stay in business, they <em>have to.</em>

  body: "As a former employee still on good terms I'm obviously biased, but I'd also
    agree that Nick & John Hudson's analogy is much more accurate than John Downer
    & James'.\r\n\r\nAlso note that any erroneous font articles are publicly correctable
    (though subject to a review from the MyFonts team before going live)."

  body: "Yup.  \r\n\r\nI'm sure John Downer said it as a glib off the cuff remark
    but calling it a \"Walmart\" is not only harsh, it presents a false and more benign
    image of Walmart than it deserves .\r\n\r\n"

  body: My fonts are like a college student's refrigerator of type. Nobody has access
    to them except me, and some of them haven't been touched in a while or have developed
    growths... some are meatloafy-composites and others are aged cheeses...
