  help me:\r\n\r\nI have been asked to compile a list of the characters needed to
  support a list of European languages as long as my long arm.\r\n\r\nIdeally I need
  a resource that lists the characters needed to display each language, but despite
  looking around, I haven't found anything.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest how to approach
  this?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "For my Latin fonts I use a self-made list of characters imported as .enc-file
    into Fontlab. This list orders all characters and accented combinations needed
    to cover all European languages set in Latin. *All*. \r\nThe list is a reliable
    compiling tool and is far more better than all codepages and encoding schemes
    all the big players have created in three decades.\r\nIf interested, go to [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=214&changelang=2|this
    site]] and there find \u201Ccharacter repertoire\u201D-pdfs for download."
