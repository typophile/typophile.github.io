  of Art and Design Basel]] \u2013 which originates from the famous [[http://www.sfgbasel.ch|Basel
  School of Design]] where important typographers like Emil Ruder, Armin Hoffmann
  and Wolfgang Weingart once tought new ways to use type \u2013 did several concepts
  for the yearbook 09/10 of the [[http://www.theaterbasel.ch|Theater Basel]]. To the
  end of the semester these concepts were presented to the theater's administration
  and other guest in a brief exhibition. \r\n\r\nBecause there were some very interesting
  ideas shown I want to give you a chance to see into the creative work of the new
  generations of young Swiss graphic designers. [[http://www.visualattitudes.com/blog/article/17-exhibition-of-the-basel-typography-class.html|Have
  a look at a short review of the exhibition]] and detailed descriptions of some of
  the shown concepts.\r\n\r\nI hope for some opinions to be posted to the comment
  section \u2013 of course! ;)\r\nvia [[http://www.visualattitudes.com/blog/|visualattitudes.com]]"
