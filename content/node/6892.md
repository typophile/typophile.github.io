body: Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>Does anyone here recognize this typeface?  It was used
  by a sports team in the late 1890&#39;s in England, and I&#39;m trying to find its
  modern-day equivalent.  Take a look at those &#39;A&#39;s and &#39;S&#39;s.  Pretty
  distinctive, don&#39;t you think? <BR> <BR>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!
  <BR> <BR>Many thanks for your time, <BR> <BR>Andrew <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49960.jpg"

    Poster</a>, which is more narrow and rounded like the sample, but is obliqued.
    You may be able to skew it back, but that&#39;s pretty dicey.
