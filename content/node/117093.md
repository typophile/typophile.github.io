    on WTF Forum should be <strong>Letraset English Tudor</strong>, an open face blackletter
    with open areas filled in.\r\n<blockquote>This sample is actually a typeface called
    English Tudor which was dewigned by Letraset in 1981 as dry-transfer lettering.
    \r\nEnglish Tudor was an open face black letter, the sample shown is someone filled
    in the open areas to make a solid version for the logo shown.\r\nEnglish Tudor
    has not been digitized as of yet, it could happen by having an open and a solid
    version.\r\nYou can find English Tudor in Letraset Graphics Manual (1981-1997).</blockquote>\r\nMay
    be having a look to [[http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann|Dieter
    Steffmann blackletter collection]] might worth a shot. "
