If you go to SPD.org you might find some spreads of ours; we won Silver Medal for magazine of the year last year &#40;ha! and yet here I am asking about Minion, hm?&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The photos and illos are usually pretty nice &#40;illos by the Clayton Bros, Brian Cronin, Zohar Lazar, etc., photos by James Nachtwey, Anton Corbijn, Jake Chessum, etc.&#41; . <BR>I think the main thing is that our creative director would like to make a departure from the body copy font that she had to inherit when she arrived at the magazine. Right now we&#39;re using Caslon224 Book. Yeek. The other fonts we use mainly are Interstate, Giza and BigCaslon for display.  <BR> <BR>I also thought that maybe Miller &#40;Font Bureau&#41; would work well as a new serif?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jana -- OUTSIDE is too interesting for Minion. Interesting in a bold, graphic, appealing sort of way. I&#39;m not an outdoorsy type, but I still find myself looking at the mag when I&#39;m in Border&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Miller is wonderful. And as a bonus you can license the display and text versions when you feel like splashing out with larger serifs. I also think it flows well with Big Caslon. Or if you want something a little more understated you might look at Whitman &#40;also from Font Bureau&#41;. Both have OsF and smallcaps and all the requisite goodies. <BR> <BR>Another idea, perhaps a little more similar to Minion, but more interesting IMO, would be <a href="http://bitstream.com/categories/products/nfc/iowan_complete/iowan_complete.html" target="_blank">Iowan Oldstyle</a> ... again all the goodies. <BR> <BR>Or, if you want a little more flavor than Minion, something truly French, you might try <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeJournal" target="_blank">Le Monde Journal</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, Minion wasn&#39;t bundled with Adobe apps for a couple of generations, but it is with the CS apps. I think it&#39;s a first-rate text face, but it certainly is ubiquitous. <BR> <BR>Most of the other suggestions seem pretty solid. Iowan Oldstyle, Whitman and Miller are all great choices. I think Le Monde Journal is perhaps a little too refined for this usage &#40;an objection that could also be made to Minion&#41;. <BR> <BR>One other typeface of ours springs to mind for this usage: Chaparral. I think it would be an excellent choice if you&#39;re looking for something a little more out of the ordinary. As the name suggests, it has that sturdy, outdoorsy feel. <BR> <BR>BTW, sorry that our sales folks aren&#39;t as up on typography as one might like.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>T <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, really nice to see <i>Outside</i> drop by here. I&#39;ve loved much <BR>of the magazine&#39;s design over the years. <BR> <BR>Tiffany&#39;s call for Enigma is a good one. Pick up a copy of <i>Details</i> <BR>for an example of how well it works. <BR> <BR>I think another interesting choice was <i>Wallpaper</i>&#39;s use of <BR>Plantin Schoolbook. Plantin is a proven long-reading face, but <BR>the &#39;a&#39; and &#39;g&#39; variants of the Schoolbook version lent a distinctive <BR>quality without being overbearing. Not sure if they&#39;re still using <BR>it because I haven&#39;t seen <i>Wallpaper</i> in a while, but <a href="http://typographi.ca/000490.php" target="_blank">here</a>&#39;s an <BR>example of the copy I saw. <BR> <BR>Of course, none of these have the condensed quality of Minion, <BR>but I think condensed is overrated for a text face. Instead, use a <BR>smaller point with generous leading.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jana, I&#39;m thinking the three &#34;character traits&#34; you want here are: robust, honest, and youthful. Besides that you want something highly readable for a magazine, mostly meaning something with a somewhat large but not too large x-height. I&#39;ll resist suggesting a wedge-serif yet again &#40;my &#34;pet genre&#34;, Jana, since you might not have been here long enough to realize :-&#41;, but ideally I think you want something wide, somewhat rigid but a touch idiosyncratic, with chunky serifs. <BR> <BR>Of the suggestions so far, Whitman and Miller seem good, although the former might be a touch too feminine here - but its proportions are right on, and it has a bounce in its step that Miller might be lacking. Now that I think about it, maybe Miller is too stodgy here. <BR> <BR>BTW, in the Adobe library, besides Chaparral &#40;a great suggestion&#41; you might consider Warnock too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Congrats on ditching the Caslon 224. <BR> <BR>As a fellow magazine designer, I respectfully disagree with Hrant and Thomas about Chapparal.

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; always same things are proposed. <BR> <BR>Yes, that&#39;s a problem &#40;with me at least&#41;. When asked casually, people will propose what&#39;s at the top of their heads at the moment. My own &#34;excuse&#34; is that I have too little experience <i>using</i> type &#40;even less than your average type designer&#41;, but what I can try to do is apply what I&#39;ve learned about &#34;congeniality&#34; &#40;or what Ovink calls &#34;atmosphere value&#34;&#41; to the choices at hand. <BR> <BR>And I think what you&#39;re doing JF, staying in our &#34;minds&#34; by participating here, is good for your fonts. <BR> <BR>&#62; Outside is a particularly American looking mag. <BR>&#62; So it is appropriate to go for something with <BR>&#62; a US flavor. <BR> <BR>But suggesting a &#34;robust, honest, and youthful&#34; font for a male outdoorsy mag is not? <BR> <BR>Plantin Schoolbook: yes, I agree it&#39;s robust and honest, but more than youthful to me it just feels retarded. Those alternates are not working, as far as I&#39;m concerned - certainly not for adult material - they were made to ease learning, and that&#39;s how they really work. <BR> <BR>&#62; gobbledegook <BR> <BR>Yes, do ignore 5 centuries of anecdotal evidence and a century of empirical evidence, because Larson said so. Oh and of course because Emigre said so. &#34;We Read Best What We Read Most.&#34; The Hogwash of the Century. And Avant Garde is just as readable as Adobe Garamond, at least as long as you read it -and nothing else- for 5000 years. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html" target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_read1.html</a> <BR> <BR>Oh, I so wish there was a sans version of ITC Garamond, which we could set at 14 point in long lines, with big word spaces, negative leading and &#43;25 tracking. That would be such a... <i>cultural</i> statement. Just make sure the content isn&#39;t worth actually reading, &#39;cause nobody will. <BR> <BR>People are making <i>news</i> faces with zero understanding of readabililty. That&#39;s &#34;democracy&#34; for you. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>That said, there is I think some cultural justification for using a sans in a magazine... although it certainly helps that magazine reading sessions tend to be very short! Don&#39;t pull a stunt like that in a book, unless you think that humans are ethereal beings who use osmosis and not vision to read. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">It depends on how you define &#34;immersive reading&#34;. Larson&#39;s parallel-letterwise model is inherently limited in terms of how deep into immersion it can go. Any act of reading that doesn&#39;t use boumas can&#39;t be said to be fully immersive. For an adult reader, the only thing &#34;below&#34; parallel-letterwise reading is sequential-letterwise reading, and since adults are proficient in parallelism, it actually takes an extra effort to read sequentially - so the immersive threshold for adults is between letterwise and bouma, not sequential and parallel. <BR> <BR>BTW, I have spent plenty of time learning not only what Larson said, but also reading up on almost all his references. Anyway, there will be a round table discussion in Thessaloniki in a month &#40;with John Hudson moderating, so I&#39;m already at a disadvantage, even though I&#39;m sure John will try to be objective - but a human is a human&#41; and we&#39;ll see what people conclude. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I&#39;m guilty of suggesting the &#34;same old,&#34; too. But what most of these suggestions seem to ignore is that the new text face has to work with the existing type -- Jana didn&#39;t say that Outside was undergoing a complete redesign. For that reason, and knowing that most headlines in Outside are &#34;designed,&#34; rather than merely &#34;set,&#34; I think quieter body type would make more sense.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey, wait a second - more than half of those are fonts I recommend all the time!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Jana, I just took a look at the current issue of Outside, and here&#39;s some ideas: <BR>-It&#39;s a really busy, even riotous magazine! Sometimes even a humorless guy like me gets turned on - like I loved the look of that &#34;crazy mofos&#34; article. <BR>-The Caslon for text actually has a charm here, I think - but it&#39;s also too frail, and a bit old-fashioned. <BR>-Interstate: although it makes sense in an outdoor transportation sort of way, to me it feels like the odd man out: too plain, and not in a constructive way, because there&#39;s a lot going on anyway. <BR> <BR>So I might suggest these ideas: <BR>-Do try Chaparral. Coupled to that charming fat Egyptian for subheads, I think it might sing sing sing. <BR>-Consider dumping Interstate. As a sub, try to find a sans that matches Chaparral. Like what? <BR> <BR>I think the highly &#34;talkative&#34; layout needs a somewhat more focused base to really work optimally, and reducing the number of fonts &#40;which is not the same thing as taming all the fonts&#41; might really click. On the other hand, no magazine I&#39;ve designed has won an award. My defence here is that I&#39;ve never designed a magazine. :-P <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
