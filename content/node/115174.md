    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill">type designer</a>).

  body: "It's a nice little quiz -- a couple of  the questions were indeed tricky.
    I bet I'd get the classic Helvetica/Arial Conundrum wrong if there was a ticking
    clock :-)\r\n\r\nThink you could add a few questions more?"

    body: Thanks for the suggestion! I added a few more type identification questions.

  body: "[This comment sort of contains spoilers if you haven't taken the quiz.]\r\n\r\nThat
    was fun, but easy. Got them all, except the sheep one, even though I knew the
    answer and was all prepared to correct you after taking the quiz, only to find
    out you were one step ahead of me. Go harder! Go more obscure! It's not tricky
    enough yet."

    body: Thanks for taking the quiz and the feedback. I definitely want to make something
      more challenging in the future. I wanted to do something that covered some basic
      type trivia. Also, anyone can create quizzes on Bloxi. It would be awesome to
      see some other typophiles creating great content.

  body: "Maybe a spoiler, maybe not -- 'cause I haven't looked at the answers given
    for the test.\r\n\r\nBut as far as disparaging  sheep thievery goes, at least
    as far back as Tom Sawyer. But I suspect we have to ask \"does the source have
    to use English? Modern English?\"\r\n\r\n...from The adventures of Tom Sawyer:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Tom
    drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I dare you to step
    over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand up. Anybody that'll take a dare
    will steal sheep.\"</blockquote>"

  body: "The new type ID questions are pretty awesome. Univers vs. Frutiger? Nice!
    Add more like this.\r\n\r\nNeeds some additional Q's on other topics to balance
    it out. Both trivia (like the sheep question), as well as type basics and terminology
    (like the bowl question, but harder)."

    to identify <em>which</em> Garamond? I've got about six or eight."

  body: That is an excellent idea! My goal is to start out with something fairly basic
    and then do something more advanced later on.
