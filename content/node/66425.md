  Unicode font-linked to SimSun and MingLiU.\r\n\r\nFor example, when an Chinese operating
  version of Windows was running, and if you type \u5730\u5740\u7C3F\u540C\u6B69\r\n\r\n
  and \u5143 pronounced as \u3082\u3068 for Japanese, then the text was displayed
  as MS UI Gothic. If the font has added font linkings to SimSun and PMingLiU, and
  then the system was restarted, it may be done."
