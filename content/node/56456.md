  am curious:\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know a reputable place to look for freelance web
  designers / designers in general that can produce quality work? (Not eLance, craigslist,
  or Contracted Work - I have tried these services, and the designers are way sub-par
  for my interests.)\r\n\r\nIs this a place I could solicit bids? \r\n\r\nThis board
  offers some of the most respectable designers on the web, and I figured I'd come
  here for answers.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nAdam Dolch"

    people to reply to so that the thread doesn\u2019t turn into a fight over pricing.
    \r\n\r\nAlso consider AIGA Design jobs, a special version of Coroflot that only
    displays the portfolios of AIGA members. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that AIGA
    designers are better or more reputable than other designers, but I find that most
    of the really bad/sleazy designers out there aren\u2019t willing to pay for an
    AIGA membership and create another online portfolio."

    and identity]] work.\r\n\r\nI've run into the same problem as you looking for
    jobs on Craigslist. There are plenty of people looking for professional logo design
    as spec work. I would highly discourage posting a job on any of the [[http://www.renderedred.com/the_crowdspring_experiment.html|crowdsourcing]]
    sites (crowdSpring, 99designs, etc), especially if you're looking for quality
    work."
