    was revived by Paratype as <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/New-Zelek.htm\">New
    Zelek</a>. EDIT: Yes, it was an <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/7548\">Mecanorma-typeface</a>
    as Mark Simonson told here. \r\n\r\nCristal looks like the bastard-son from <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/soda-script/\">Soda Script</a> and
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/candice-lt/\">Candice</a>. \r\n\r\n45
    T. GEANT looks like simply Helvetica. \r\n\r\nFor Mandre you could start by searching
    here for a typeface called \xBB<a href=\"http://www.google.at/search?hl=de&q=%22baby+teeth+site%3Atypophile.com&btnG=Google-Suche&meta=\">Baby
    Teeth</a>\" from Milton Glaser (not digitized until now, there should be lots
    of suggestions for alternates inside the threads). "

    true, but there is a version, made by ParaType, called <a href=\"http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Bebit.htm\"><strong>Bebit</strong></a>."
