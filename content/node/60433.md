  see on packaging from the early to mid 20th century.\r\nThanks!"

    in the earlier half of the twentieth century, at least not in the US. And the
    current versions of Akizidenz are dramatically different from what was in use
    before Lange started changing the design in the 1950s. Franklin is ok, as are
    most of the old ATF sans faces, such as Alt Gothic, Inland Gothic, Blair, etc. "

  body: The reason I suggest Richmond is that a lot of packaging was hand lettered
    up to the 1970s, and Richmond has a hand rendered feel.

    sizes of AG, in the normal weight, that Lange evened out.\r\nIn general, he made
    AG look more like the new Haas face which would be subsequently named Helvetica.\r\nWhich
    is ironic (or merely incestuous), as Helvetica was a modification of AG."

  body: "'Helvetica was a modification of AG' : I do not think so, actually, I think
    it draws \"inspiration\" from other typefaces from the same era, but whatever.\r\n\r\nbtw
    nick, your book arrived. I couldnt put my hands on it yet (i'll be in france in
    2 weeks), but thank you very much. i'm impatient."
