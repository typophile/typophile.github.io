  Script</a></strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophilegalgo_3416.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  Galgo is a Spanish greyhound, an ancient hybrid breed of dog. Just like the Galgo,
  the letters of this font are a mix of elegant brush calligraphy and the rough, weathered
  strokes of speedy scrawl. Galgo Script is quite suitable for logomarks, titles,
  short headlines and lengthy artistic passages. Drawn by Angel Koziupa and expanded
  and digitized by Alejandro Paul, Galgo Script was created due to the demand for
  this kind of \u201Crushed brush\u201D.\r\n\r\nVisit <strong><a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com\">Sudtipos</a></strong>
