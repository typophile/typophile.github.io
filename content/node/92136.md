body: I made my own font in Fontographer 5.1 and "luckily" downloaded FogLamp Demo
  version and converted font to TTF and installed.I opened Adobe Illustrator,typed
  few letters and I see these strange discolorations on some characters;watermarks.After
  I figured out this information,I tried to search for full version of FogLamp on
  torrentman.com,but nothing was there;so I googled and all you can find is demo version.
  Does anyone know,where to find any converter that converts FOG files(.fog) without
  leaving watermarks(possibly full version for free)? Thanks for a lot!
