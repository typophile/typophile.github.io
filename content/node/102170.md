  like the way the titles are made. I would like to know the name of the fonts but
  also if you know the names of the ding bats (I think that's what they are called
  LOL) of the lines, stars etc. that have been used to decorate the titles. \r\nThanks
  a lot!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example 1_4541.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example
