body: It is a very blocky, solid style, with hard edges and 90 degree angles.  Very
  much like impact.    The main difference is that the m doesn&#39;t have a hard straight
  line on the left side and instead it&#39;s two symmetric rainbows.  And the W is
  more like an upside down M, it doesn&#39;t have hard corners, instead it&#39;s rounded.   Overall
  is a very thick font with straight edges, symmetric, rounded edges.  Any names come
  to mind?  Thanks

    Can you show us a sample, or make a sketch and post the image &#40;as a .gif or
    .jpg&#41;?

    the bill. It&#39;s got the round/hard edges and the M/W you describe: <BR> <BR><a

    the blockiness, the sharp edges and very rounded and symmetric overall feel.'
