  body: Hmm. They could have flopped the A in Watson as well as the one in lawyers.
    However, I find it distracting, and I believe most people will not accept such

    tracking is changed.\r\ni.e. it would only occur when the letters are close, not
    when letterspaced, where it is not necessary."
