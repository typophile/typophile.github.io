  playful yet - I assume - quite legible title or display typeface.\r\n\r\nWhat do
  you think of it? What do you like or dislike?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimen_013_4280.jpg]"

  body: "Great work, I like it. Reminds me of the seventies.\r\n\r\nYet the T, P and
    R look a bit unstable - gravitationally challenged, as if they might break a leg
    one day. IMV the F is a bit too massive, crossing the baseline with not only a
    line but a triangular shape.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try alternatives:\r\n- use
    a triangle instead of two legs for the R (open the bowel to compensate too much
    weight)\r\n- try to give the T some kind of umbrella stand.\r\n- give the P a
    stronger stem (cf. I and H)\r\nFor the F I could think of something like: upper
    half as it is, lower half like the H without the vertical line at the right.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "I disagree with the above, as I think much of the face's distinctiveness
    is that it has no need for a regard for gravity, like it makes its home in outer
    space. However, the lines of T and L are too thin; they ought to match the thickness
    of the lines in the other letters.\r\n\r\nThe B seriously looks like it may be
    a K. I'm reading \"fakergraph\"."

    opinion is highly appreciated - I keep on working on some of the glyps mentioned
    above.\r\n\r\nThanks one more time!"

    a few more letters in that style. \r\n\r\nI'd almost like to see an alternate
    P, T & R in that style too."

    and more I&H-like ones.\r\n\r\nBut before that here is some lowercase preview.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you, Typophiles, think of it?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sketches_lowercase_01_6396.jpg]"

  body: "+I like the lower case letters in general, although the f, l, g, and s [the
    eternal problem in this style] don't seem to blend as well as the others.  The
    i,j,k series is very nice, but the two small diamonds in the l don't seem to help.
    \ The f and g seem too busy, too many pieces.  They don't \"read\" as easily as
    the other letters.  Great work, keep it up.  I could be a customer!  Please keep
    me informed.[michael@bsiw.us]\r\n\r\nmgk"

  body: "Not liking the \"g\" myself. Maybe you could make the descender more like
    the curve of the j or t. \r\n\r\nJust a thought, you could probably make this
    into 4 different fonts based on the designs of abc, ijk, hmn, and vwxy."

  body: "Thanks Special-K!\r\n\r\nI'm unsatisfied with many lowercase glyphs also
    - keeping try more and more ideas I have to have a fine set.\r\n\r\nAlso have
    the idea you mentioned :) thanks!\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about a more blocky and
    a more graphic (much like this so far) versions, maybe as stylistic alternates
    in OT or separated versions."
