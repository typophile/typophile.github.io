In VOLT, Marks Positioning is carried out Independently for each letter and for each component of every ligature?!
So, to avoid the Collision of Marks with Marks and/or Letters in Arabic Fonts:
1 The thinest letter or ligature should be at least a bit wider than the widest mark. Just like asking 3 cowboys to stand side by side without allowing their Hats to collide. And this can be done at the expense of Beauty.
2 Marks should be horizontally centered on top of or below each letter and each component of every ligature. And this is not always possible even if Beauty is sacrificed.
Samples speak louder than words?!

<p>Dealing with ligatures is essentially the same, but may be tricky, though. OpenType model can not distinguish between mark over one or another component, except for mark-to-liga attachments.

There could be workaround for that, for example having separate glyphs for mark over first second etc. component.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I have also contextually inserted a very narrow joining stroke between two letters when I need to accomodate a mark that might otherwise collide with an adjoining letter. This is appropriate in more linear designs, rather than in the kind of calligraphic design shown in the illustration. Calligraphy has its own rules for mark size and positioning.</p>

.. Higher and higher till I get all Marks on the same level (Mac it).
For the best mark positioning you can ever get with a ligature-free font, see this:

Just tell me please where to position what out of hundreds — not to say thousands — of marks:

<a href="http://qurankareem.info/a/othmanyQuran.zip">http://qurankareem.info/a/othmanyQuran.zip</a>
This will make the brain of an octopus-minded to work overtime to work around Independently up and down, across and back, diagonally in 4 direction so that Marks wont collide.</p>

However, Sergey &amp; John took the question seriously and shouldn&rsquo;t be harshed for trying to offer some advice. Falling into the same trap I might suggest that the power users of VOLT do a lot of the number crunching outside of VOLT (eg in Excel and perl based tools), and import the source tables into VOLT for compilation - that&rsquo;s apparently the best approach on complex jobs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">By the way, I don&rsquo;t think that OpenType is the <em>best</em> way to handle Arabic text. There are, for instance, good arguments for layout systems that treat diacritic marks as a separate layer applied after word formation. Contextual mark positioning and spacing adjustment is the most difficult and cumbersome aspect of Arabic OpenType, especially if one wants refinement. The benefit of OpenType is in its wide support and adaptability. If you have a different solution that works for your needs &ndash; even if it only works in one application and requires macros &ndash;, is there a need to make an OpenType version?</div>

Though the example given does not occur in Arabic, I do understand what you mean. Any how, if it is applied to the last word in the first sample (on the left), it will be spoilt?
How if a word ends with R+TaMarbota and the Tanween of TaMarbota collides with R?</div>

Yes. There is a need to make an OpenType version to benefit from the OpenType wide support and adaptability to long documents not a couple of lines that can be fantastically handled in a number of applications by creating 2 layers: one for letters and the other for marks!</p>

<p>There are two ways to deal with this kind of collision. I believe the more traditional technique is to contextually lower the Tanween so that it no longer collides with the R. Another technique is to introduce a contextually sensitive kerning adjustment between the R and the TaMarbota when the latter is followed by a below mark. I think the decision which method to use depends very much on the type design. In a very modern, linear design one might want to make the heights of marks quite regular and not raise or lower them contextually, so in that case the kerning option might be best. In a traditional naskh design, though, one might want to preserve the letter relationships and allow the marks to move as necessary; this better emulates the scribal approach.</p>

<p>Although every Arabic font I have worked on to date has involved ligature glyphs for one reason or another, I actually think that the better approach is not to use ligatures, but instead to have component stroke shapes which are contextually substituted to produce the correct forms. This technique is much more adaptable and efficient. Consider, for example, Monotype Nastaliq, which had up to 22,000 ligature glyphs &ndash; some for entire words &ndash; in its late metal and final phototype versions, but which has recently been remade in OpenType using only a small fraction of that number of glyphs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aware of some fonts that even use component strokes to create the lam_alif sequence, i.e. that do not contain any ligatures at all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David,</p>
<p>Tom Milo&rsquo;s DecoType Arabic layout system uses a layering approach which follows the way in which calligraphers construct a word. First the &lsquo;archigraphemes&rsquo; of the letters are written; these are the letters, correctly formed, but without any marks at all, not even the distinguishing dots. Then the dots are written relative to the letterforms and taking into account context of nearby strokes. Then vowels are written relative to both letterforms and dots. If I remember correctly, Tom breaks the system down into about seven different layers, based on classification of marks. Also, marks in the system are not of fixed size, but may be longer or shorter depending on context, as found in calligraphy.</p>
<p>Although all my own Arabic work has been in OpenType, I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that only an approach like Tom&rsquo;s can result in optimal mark positioning. The downside of such a system is that it tends to be very slow: not something you would want to use for, e.g. e-mail. But in the context of book production, it is the best thing available.</p>

<p>In this case, I believe the method is not an inserted narrow stroke but a variant form of the K, but yes the result is the same.</p>
<p><em>The 3 words on the right of the lower line are not ligatured as above. In other words. Marks spoilt the ligatures.</em></p>
<p>This font contains two different kinds of ligature lookups. Some ligatures are allowed to form even when marks are involved in the sequence (in VOLT, they are set to process NONE of the mark glyphs), and some ligatures are inhibited from forming when marks are involved (in VOLT, they are set to process ALL mark glyphs). This is a design decision. In the Arabic Typsetting font, Mamoun Sakkal decided to prevent ligatures involving vertical stacking from forming when marks are applied, because in these situations it is sometimes confusing, even for the reader, to know to which letter in the ligature a mark is applied.</p>
<p>I use the same method when dealing with the initial lam_mim sequence, in which the mim portion of the ligature ends up to the right of the lam, which phonetically precedes it. So if the lam takes a mark, I prevent this ligature from forming because it is too easy to be confused about which letter is taking the mark.</p>
<p>Of course, if one is seeking to emulate the traditional naskh style including its mark positioning, then one probably doesn&rsquo;t want to inhibit ligation in these circumstances. But then one is also presuming a level of readership that is quite high.</p>

<p>In most Arabic fonts I have worked with, ligatures tend to be limited to a few isolated sequences, a few initial sequences, and generally more final sequences. But there is no reason why a font could not contain medial ligatures.</p>
<p>The issue that one runs into, though, is deciding which ligatures take preference. This is another reason why I favour a non-ligature approach, which is more flexible and is not constrained by choices about what ligatures to include and which take precedence.</p>

How wonderful the font will look like then!
Medial ligatures make words shorter (less horizontal) and more comfortable to the eyes ( for Arabs and non-Arabs):</p>

This should not be an issue as the priority is given to 2 middle shapes: Meem then to the sea-horse (Jeem and likewise).</p>

A better approach is a combination of the 2: 3&amp;4-component ligatures and stroke shapes to produce 2-component ligatures.</p>

<p>Less horizontal, of course, usually means more vertical, and this <em>may</em> have been a factor in the decision not to employ medial ligatures in the Arabic Typesetting font. This font is mainly going to be used in an application like MS Word, by users who are used to employing fonts using the default linespacing. In such a situation, having word forms growing tall through use of medial ligatures could cause problems with parts of letters being clipped as they extend beyond the font&rsquo;s WinAscent setting. Obviously in fonts designed primarily for use by experienced typographers such as yourself, or in professional page layout applications, this would be less of a concern.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">So far, Marks and Ligatures have been covered, but kerning was out of discussion.
Sampling 3 words in the ArabicTypesetting font created by John Hudson with VOLT, see how the kerning between (Z+Alif) and (R+3ain) has shortened and beautified the middle word. But no kerning took place between (R+Alif) in the left word nor between (R+3ain) in the right one&hellip;
Why does kerning work in some places and does not work for the very couple(s) elsewhere? Was the fault in VOLT? Or elsewhere?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Aziz, I did not create the Arabic Typesetting font: I only designed the Latin portion of the typeface. Mamoun Sakkal designed the Arabic, beginning with an initial idea from Paul Nelson, and Mamoun also did the VOLT work for the font.</p>
<p>I think the kerning problem you are seeing must be due to the Arabic Typesetting kerning being implemented as a width adjustment on the first glyph, which is how GPOS kerning is properly implemented for <em>left-to-right</em> scripts. When this font was made, no one had figured out that right-to-left kerning needs to be implemented differently &ndash; as equivalent width and positioning adjustments to the second glyph &ndash;; I presume this will be fixed in the next version of this font. [Microsoft may be concerned about backwards compatibility and text reflow in existing documents, but this kerning problem is so bad that I think such concerns should be ignored.]</p>
<p>If right-to-left kerning is implemented in the same way as left-to-right, only every second pair of glyphs gets kerned, and this is what you are seeing in your test. If you were to add another character before the sequence زرع then you would see the kerning suddently applied between رع. You see this in the graphic below. The second line shows the Adobe Arabic font, in which the kerning has been applied to the second glyph in the lookups, and the spacing is consistent regardless of the number of glyphs in the run.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ataakern_4689.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>[Note that if one uses the kern2volt tool to convert a FontLab generated kern table to GPOS kerning in VOLT, the tool has an -RTL option that will correctly define the lookups for right-to-left scripts. You will need separate kern table sources for RTL and LTR kerning though.]</p>

<p>Say: True only if R is added. Or a zero-width non-joiner!
The 2nd word from the left in my very first sample says otherwise&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>VOLT for Arabic is not very complicated &ndash; not compared to, say, Devanagari, which I&rsquo;m working on at the moment. The basic GSUB shaping features &ndash; init, medi, fina (isol is optional, basically only necessary if you want to perform contextual heh shaping) &ndash; are very straight forward, as are the ligature substitutions. Things are trickier if you start getting into contextual substitutions, e.g. if you have different glyph forms that you want to employ in different situations, but even then you just need to keep track of your contexts.</p>
<p>GPOS mark positioning is probably the most difficult thing you&rsquo;ll need to learn for Arabic, and is mainly tricky because the interface might not be intuitive at first. Read the tutorials carefully.</p>
<p>VOLT isn&rsquo;t a massive program &ndash; it does some specific tasks for OpenType Layout development &ndash; so there isn&rsquo;t very much to learn in terms of interface. The thing that takes time is figuring out the best way to do things for different scripts, and also learning what expectations shaping engines have for those scripts.</p>

I organized the shapes to change with the proceeding or before character to work like a ligature. i.e the fist image shows three shapes where meem_mid, ta_ini and ya_before_noon changes its shape accordingly with the proceeding characters.

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Is it possible to make 2 marks go with a single letter as shown here?</em></p>
<p>Yes,* although what your image shows would normally be two different kinds of lookups.</p>
<p>In the first word, with the damma above the fatha on the initial mim, this would be handled as an above mark-to-mark positioning. So the fatha would be positioned relative to the mim, and the damma would be positioned relative to the fatha.</p>
<p>In the second word, both the shadda and the kasra are positioned relative to the letter, the medial qaf, using two separate anchor attachments, one above and one below.</p>
<p>To render the second word, it is also possible to write the kasra directly below the shadda, with both marks above the letter. In this case, one would perform a mark ligation using the ccmp feature. This is a decision of the font developer.</p>
<p>Note that above mark-to-mark and below mark-to-mark positioning should be defined in separate lookups, with the above mark-to-mark lookup set to ignore below marks and vice versa. This ensures that mark-to-mark positioning occurs even when, e.g. two above marks are separated in the character sequence by an interverning below mark.</p>

<li>Note: although OpenType allows you to apply mark-to-mark positioning for any sequence of marks, some applications or shaping engines may restrict certain sequences if they consider them to be grammatically invalid. So, for instance, the sequence of fatha with damma shown in your example is not recognised by the Uniscribe Arabic engine as a valid sequence, so the damma displays on a dotted circle. Personally, I think this is a really bad idea, and I suspect MS are beginning to think so too: a script shaping engine should not be acting as a spellchecker! The same sequence displays without the dotted circle in InDesign ME, with the damma above the fatha according to the OpenType mark-to-mark positioning.</li>

VOLT is so passive that it trades off Marks with Ligatures?!</p>
<p>I think, Yes, positioning of marks on ligatures is very difficult to handle in Volt, That is why, i used different shapes instead of ligatures to correctly place marks. The page you see in PDF format contains only one ligature i.e. &ldquo;Lilla&rdquo; the last word in first row.</p>
<p>Pl. also see the last word in the fourth row, where middle shape of &ldquo;ta&rdquo; changed accordingly to help placing of marks.</p>

Here are 2x2 words written on the same line in the very Wordpad of windows:
The left wing reads ArabicTypesetting and the right wing reads Tahoma.
Emphasizing: Same Engine, Same words, and Same line.
How nice Tahoma is that it does not force:
• marry the classmates (Kasra to Shadda).
• separate the spouses (?).
Why ArabicTypesetting  is not so democratic?

<p>The second issue is more surprising. I&rsquo;ve tested this with a lot of different fonts, and the only ones in which the damma does not appear on a dotted circle are fonts that do not contain any OpenType GPOS mark positioning. In Tahoma, the marks are not positioned using anchors, they just fall wherever their offsets on their zero-widths put them, and they are not classified as marks in the GDEF table. So I think Uniscribe is dealing with these fonts in different ways. Uniscribe is not one shaping engine, but several, including different engines for different scripts, some for backwards compatibility. What Uniscribe does with a particular string depends on both the characters in that string and what tables exist in the font.</p>

<p>Arabic fonts without &lsquo;arab&rsquo; script in GPOS are considered by Uniscribe as legacy fonts and processed by old shaping engine, which does not support lots of things like contextual substitutions or mark positioning. Marks can be processed using &lsquo;mset&rsquo; feature. New fonts, recognized by presence of GPOS, are processed by new engine that supports all OpenType layout lookups.</p>
<p>In Avalon, there is only one engine, which has the same rules as a new one in Uniscribe.</p>
<p>I do not know exactly why limitation of a single mark of each type over the base was introduced for Arabic script. I can imagine some security (spoofing) or backward compatibility reasons. I will try to find out more.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Handling mark positioning on ligatures is more complicated than on single-component glyphs, but it certainly isn&rsquo;t impossible. One needs to define the ligature glyphs as ligatures in the GDEF table (using VOLT&rsquo;s glyph edit window) and correctly record the number of components in the ligature, e.g. 2 components for the lam_alif ligatures. Then you create a mark-to-ligature lookup associated with the mark feature, and define anchor attachments for the individual components. Here are some examples of mark-to-ligature positioning in two fonts I have worked on, Adobe Arabic and Karim LT, showing marks applied to several two-component ligatures.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/arablgmk_6313.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>My own dissatisfaction with ligatures is not with the relative difficulty of mark positioning, but with the awkwardness of the transition between two ligatures, e.g. between the theh_mim and the dad_yeh in the last word. Ligatures create elegant flowing forms for the invidiual pairs of letters, but the connection between them is not elegant and looks awkward compared to the ligatures. A ligature-free approach such as our Pakistani colleague can resolve this.</p>
<p>The Arabic fonts I have worked on to date have all been based on a ligature model, because that was the nature of the designs as provided. When I design my own Arabic typeface, I intend to avoid ligatures.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sergey, a short while ago on one of the Unicode lists, Paul Nelson expressed the view that script shaping engines should not be performing what are, in effect, spellchecking functions. I took this as a hopeful sign that we might see a lot fewer dotted circles in future!</p>
<p>In my Biblical Hebrew font, I actually include a lookup that removes dotted circles from glyph strings, so that any combination of marks can be applied to any base, because scholars working with ancient manuscripts may need to represent non-standard spellings. Looking at what Uniscribe is doing with Arabic, I&rsquo;d be inclined to do the same sort of thing in Arabic fonts. But the problem then is that users who actually want to display a dotted circle, e.g. to show a mark in isolation, are unable to. It would be much preferable if Uniscribe simply gave up on trying to enforce &lsquo;valid&rsquo; mark sequences. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, a valid mark sequence is any mark sequence that a user deliberately creates, and it is up to the font to succeed or fail in rendering the sequence in an acceptable way. So far as I know, there are no invalid mark sequences for Latin GPOS: marks can stack endlessly. It should be so for all scripts employing the mkmk feature.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with. Arabic Calligraphy is basically combination of curves &amp; stroks. As nicer your curves, the font looks elegant. Almost all the computer fonts which I have seen, have sufficent number of ligatures. That is due to difficulty of curves and joining points which decreases the fluency of strokes. But I think, it is not so difficult to handle. If we manage to perfect our curves and shapes, we don&rsquo;t need to have any ligature at all. Marks are so easy to place on seprated shapes. Also if we insert any &ldquo;Kashida&rdquo;, it will not cause any broken ligatures nor collision of marks etc:</p>

<p>Yes, I agree. As I explained, the only reason the fonts I have worked on in the past have ligatures is that this is how they were designed: I was not the designer, only the person manufacturing the fonts. If I design my own Arabic typeface, I will avoid ligatures.</p>
<p>Regarding the curves and connecting strokes, OpenType has a cursive attachment GPOS lookup, which can be used to create smooth non-horizontal connections. With this, one can even produce nastaliq style with minimum ligatures.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have a suggestion for designing of any future Arabic Font that is to follow the technique of &lsquo;Nataliq&rsquo;, Computer aided Arabic scripts are traditionaly lying on base-line where base of almost all characters is on a straght line, this creates problem of accuratly placement of marks, in contrast Nastaliq is based on cuved type of writing which flows from top to bottom. It would be a good idea, if we adopt Nastaleeq policy where variation of character helps placement of Marks and Nuqtaas (dots).</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/new_words_4651.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Top part is Traditional Arabic Font and the Second one is Nafees Nastaleeq, Notice the flow of strokes of second line, this will helps in placement of marks. In South East Asia (Indo-Pak) the calligraphist adopted this policy and changed the Arabic Naskh into Naskh-cum-Nastaliq, which is easy to read and different from the Naskh of Arabic World.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Aziz, a ligature is a particular technical solution to a written form, i.e. the representation of two or more character by a single glyph. The point which I am trying to make is that the richness of the Arabic script does not rely on this particular technical solution and there are other methods to capture that richness in typography. The examples you give of elegant letter combinations can all be broken down into constituent strokes, i.e. the elegance is not dependent on these being ligatures: they could be constructed from contextually appropriate strokes. The advantage of such an approach is that it is far more flexible than even the most extensive ligatured font.</div>

<p>Why not? Any form that can be constructed as a ligature can also be constructed as strokes that, if arranged correctly, would be visually identical to the ligature. The question is whether the arrangement can be achieved in a reasonable (and efficient) way in a particular font format. When I wrote that I would avoid ligatures, I didn&rsquo;t mean that I might not end up using some ligatures, but only that I would first try to resolve the forms using individual glphs and contextual substitution and positioning. I was looking at some thuluth calligraphy today, and figuring out how I would handle it using a font; there were only a couple of forms for which I might use a ligature.</p>
<p><em>Precisely! This is the right way.</em></p>

<p>I think it is not fair, may be you are thinking this because in 99% of the fonts &lsquo;kashida&rsquo; is a straight line which destroy the beauty of curves.</p>
<p>Actually true &lsquo;kashida&rsquo; is a curved type of stroke which makes Arabic writing more elegant and easier to read. Also in some cases where marks are difficult to place &lsquo;kashida&rsquo; is a better option to adopt.

<p>I never found &lsquo;kashida&rsquo; to spoils any of my word nor behave  indiscriminately. I always found this charachter very helpful in placing marks or reducing the complexity of shapes. May be my font is an extended type of behaviour with thick base, that is why &lsquo;kashida&rsquo; helps to make more white space, which looks nicer. Also I could say that the font on which you are working is so condensed that there is no room for &lsquo;kashida&rsquo;. That is why you are against this character.</p>

<p>Dear Brother!
I don&rsquo;t know what you want to ask, there is ligature invovled in your example to whome I was mentioning in almost all of my earlier posting that use of ligatures is not a solution in Arabic. We have to make certain shapes to avoid ligatures. Ligatures does make difficult to place marks.</p>
<p>I used a short lam_initial shape to avoid marks positioning in following &lsquo;kaf&rsquo;. 
pl. see this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Aziz, the problem in the example you show is not because of the number of marks, but because the Arabic Typesetting font lacks a form of the lam_mim ligature with a short lam. It does have a short lam, which is automatically substituted before medial kaf, but it does not have a corresponding short form of the lam_mim combination. It is a design flaw, not a technology flaw.</p>
<p>There is what I consider another design flaw: a fatha above the short lam is too high, I think, and still too close to the kaf. I would probably lower it, under the arm of the kaf, to make it more clearly associated with the lam.

<li>Thanks John for the Clarification</li>
<li>What is the Alternative to Kashida?
Perfection of Arabic Calligraphy is achieved not by adding Kashida within words nor by changing Kaf — as in Adobe Indesign— but by controlling word spacings as in Adobe PageMaker—narrowing spaces between words ending with clockwise and others beginning with counterclockwise letters. 
In other words: Space width Modulation.

The lookup type for this feature is a <a href=" ">cursive attachment</a> GPOS, defining entry and exit points for a pair of glyphs. In your second example, the cursive attachment point on the right side of the seen_kah ligature is raised from the baseline, so any glyph that attaches to the right of this glyph will be raised. This feature accounts not only for the dramatic rise in this example, but also for the gradual incline of the first example.</p>
<p>In VOLT, create a new GPOS lookup, and select &lsquo;Cursive Attachment&rsquo; from the drop down menu of lookup types. You will be presented with input fields for first and second glyphs, and an anchor name, which is always &lsquo;exit&rsquo; in this kind of lookup.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Titus, yes, one can certainly do contextual adjustments to mark positioning. In the Adobe Arabic font, we use both techniques: sometimes we raise or lower a mark to avoid a collision, other times we insert a narrow connecting stroke to move two letters further apart. Where we have an isolated or final form, e.g. waw, occuring mid-word, we might also employ a contextual kerning adjustment if the following glyph takes a mark that might collide with that letter. So there are three techniques for avoiding problems with mark collisions.</div>

<p>Sorry about that. I think I left an empty href in the text, and that automatically gets linked to Typophile. I was trying to find a link directly to the part of the OpenType specification that deals with cursive attachment GPOS, but although I found the section I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to link to it.

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gpos.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gpos.htm</a></p>

<p>The &lsquo;cswh&rsquo; feature works like any other contextual feature. You define contextual lookups to implement context-specific swash letters, as distinct from the &lsquo;swsh&rsquo; feature which is used for non-contextual swash substitutions. This is an example of redundant features based on lookup type, which Adobe registered early on to limit the expected lookup types for each feature. Practically, the &lsquo;cswh&rsquo; feature isn&rsquo;t needed, because you can put the contextual lookups in the &lsquo;swsh&rsquo; feature alongside the non-contextual lookups.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As discussed in the other thread Naji started on this subject, Mac Arabic support is currently stuck between two different implementations. They have started supporting OpenType Layout, and (strangely) give preference to OTL tables over AAT tables if both occur in the same font, but their OTL support is not advanced enough to handle Arabic. AAT Arabic works very well, but it is relatively difficult to develop AAT fonts. For the time being, you have to ship separate OTL and AAT fonts, and there are some things that are possible in OTL that are not possible in AAT and vice versa, so if you want cross-platform compatibility you have to limit yourself to the things that both formats can handle.</div>

My volted font works perfectly with adobe applications on mac but not on pc, on mac it seemed much more stable. On the other hande I kept a version (not volted) of the font on PC that works with all applications (office and adobe). The ideal solution to have a font that is functional in all applications that support arabic on mac is to have it in AAT, for that you&rsquo;ll need a developer and not a designer!</p>

<p>When you define how many components your ligature consists of you are limited to 16 components (pretty much aritfical limitation, just to keep number of elements in the combobox reasonable). So, if you have very long sequence, you wont be able to correctly place marks on individual components - which you would not do anyway in this particular case.</p>
<p>But ligature lookup itself does not have any limitation on length of glyph sequence being substituted. To be sure, I just succesfully tried replacing 60 glyphs into single ligature :).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>for mark-to-base positioning is it better to use Anchor or cursive attachment operation?</cite></p>
<p>mark-to-base, mark-to-ligature, and cursive attachment are all based on aligning anchors of two glyphs. Difference between them is that mark attachment will change offset of the mark and cursive attachment can change advance width of the first glyph and vertical offset of the second. So, for mark attachment, mark-to-base is the right lookup type.</p>
<p><cite>also please for ئ ؤ shall I treat them as simple glyphs or is it better to consider them as ligatures?</cite></p>
<p>There is no clear definition in OpenType specification of what is ligature and what is component. But clasifying glyphs as ligatures with several components is only useful when you plan to attach marks to each component separately. So, number of components is usually a number of base glyphs in the ligature.</p>
<p>Your case is similar to Latin letters with accents, you do not need several components and you can define these glyphs as simple.</p>

Sergey</p>

		<div class="commentbody">hello alviamjad,
sorry but you didnt get my point. I know that i can create glyph groups, however what i meant is that isolated glyphs always occur twice in the glyph editor window, so how to deal with this when creating substitution lookups? 
i.e. I have two isolated Alefs and i want to substitute the isolated Alef with final Alef, shall i substitute both isolated Alefs or it is enough to substitue only one and the second will be substitued automatically?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Katia, in answer to your first question:</p>
<p>What you have, I presume, is the isolated character from the Unicode Arabic block (e.g. uni0628, beh) and a corresponding, redundant isolated character from the Arabic Presentation Forms (e.g. uniFE8F). The latter isn&rsquo;t necessary at all in an OpenType font (you only need character mappings for the Arabic block characters; everything else can be handled by glyph processing), but such redundant mappings might be used if the font encounters older software that uses presentation form mappings for Arabic shaping. If the redundant isolated characters are supported in the font using distinct glyphs, I would say that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether both are mapped in shaping features like init, medi and fina. OpenType Layout presumes a Unicode text handler which processes Arabic text using Arabic block codepoints. It is quite likely that such a handler will apply compatability mappings to Presentation Form characters encountered in text before glyph processing even begins, so the likelihood of e.g. the init feature needing to know what to do with uniFE8F is remote. That said, I don&rsquo;t think there is any harm in providing a double lookup.</p>

<p>The GPOS window can be a little finicky, but you shouldn&rsquo;t be getting the problem you describe. Are you being careful to specify unique anchor names, and not to reuse anchor names. One of the easiest ways to mess up previous work is to reuse an anchor name and change its position, which will affect any existing anchor positioning lookups using that anchor name.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Katia, here is an example of what I am referring to in VOLT&rsquo;s GPOS window. The red underlined anchor names must be unique for any different mark positioning. So, for example, if I have a second lookup that adjusts the position of marks contextually, e.g. raising or lowering them when preceded by certain letters, then the anchor names in that lookup could not be &lsquo;above&rsquo; and &lsquo;below&rsquo; as they are in this lookup, because any changes to positioning for the anchors named &lsquo;above&rsquo; and &lsquo;below&rsquo; will propagate to lookups using those anchor names, including work that I have already done.</p>
<p>When you first create a GPOS anchor attachment lookup, the anchor(s) in it will be named &lsquo;default&rsquo;. The first thing you should do is change this name to something specific to the lookup.</p>

&hellip;  I’d be interested in writing a proper VOLT manual if I had time and someone were to pay me.</p>
<p>First, I have come across a font utility inside Sinasoft.com package that combines the functions of Fontlab and VOLT. This 150U$ Utility is intuitive, but unfortunately not compatible with M$ and Adobe Products.</p>
<p>2 John, please consider this proposal:
Soon after supplying my (5+1) True Type Fonts, John starts transforming them into a single OTF and Aziz does the timely feedback.
Meanwhile John goes on writing the steps involved in the Font Generation and Aziz does the translation — concurrently step-by-step form start to finish.
In this way, we will have 2 comprehensive VOLT manuals—English and Arabic— and Uncompromising Arabic OTF?!
Terms and Condition— including time and cost— are subject to discussion and will be published here when finalized in the hope that they— Font and Manual— will find the Right Publisher they deserve.
Make it Together?! The earlier, the better?!
Sincerely</p>

So consider the example of a lam_alif ligature: in the Glyph Edit window you have classified the lam_alif as a ligature with 2 components. In the mark positioning window, you can select the individual components using the drop down list in the top right corner of the window. In this case, the lam is component 1 and the alif is component 2. The first thing you want to do is to lock the position of the second glyph (the mark) so that it only moves relative to the first glyph (the ligature) not relative to itself (i.e. not relative to its zero-width). This is probably what you have failed to do if you are seeing the grey mark moving when you move the black one. Once you have positioned the mark on the lam, go to the component drop down list, and select 2. The mark you have positioned on the lam will become grey, and the one you are about to position on the alif will become black. There will always be a number of marks equal to the number of components.</p>
<p>For your other question:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Export a VOLT project file (see export menu). This is a text file that contains all your glyph, lookup, feature, glyph group and option settings for the font.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the new glyphs in FontLab (I recommend adding them at the end of the glyph set to avoid having to reorder within the VOLT project).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate a new font from FontLab with the additional glyphs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the new font in VOLT, and go to the import menu to import the project file you exported earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to the Glyph Edit window and ensure that the glyph order is consistent with the imported names, classes, etc. Go to the new glyphs and give them appropriate names.</p>

I just have one last question that can be answered by yes or no:
You told me before that: “If the redundant isolated characters are supported in the font using distinct glyphs, I would say that it doesn’t really matter whether both are mapped in shaping features like init, medi and fina. OpenType Layout presumes a Unicode text handler which processes Arabic text using Arabic block codepoints.

Is this applicable to mark positioning too? I mean do I have to position marks over redundant isolated characters? Or is it remote?</div>

<p>VOLT may be exceeding maximum table size for individual lookup, most frequently kerning and sometimes mark attachment.

Thanks to the Teachers and Good luck to the Paddling Duck.</p>
<p>Just one question:</p>
<p>In both M$ and Adobe Arabic Applications, 
1 Tanweens (// and 69)) do not change letters to their final forms.
2 Full Justification is carried out by adding Kashida at the middle of words.</p>
<p>Is any of these 2 alternatives VOLTable:
1 Making Tanweens as non-joiner Marks, and/or
2 Swashing (prolonging) the final forms of letters instead of Kashida?</p>
<p>Any hint is highly appreciated.</p>

<li>I can not comment on this as I do not know enough about Arabic. We did not hear any requests/complaints about current behavior of these marks. Do you have any evidence that shaping should be enforced in this case? If tatween appears at the end of the word anyway, won&rsquo;t last letter be in the final form anyway? If it is a choice of the user, it should be implemented on the character level, possibly using zero width non-joiner. Especially if it changes meaning of the text.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think it really should be done uncondtionally, my guess is that this would be part of Uniscribe rules. But font can also be tweaked if it is needed. Contextual lookups can adjust the forms of surrounding letters.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Justification is higher level feature than shaping individual character runs. OpenType layout rules do not have any information about actual width of the line and what other content (from different scripts) is present. There is no standard protocol defined between font and text layout engine to achive what you want. Is it would exist, then VOLT will be able to implement it but so far it can&rsquo;t because of lack of the rules that should be followed.</li>

<p>Working across the line is on higher level than a font, beyond OpenType layout. As with justification, there should be a protocol defined between higher level engine and the font (e.g. through applying particular feature) to communicate intended shaping.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No complaints but enforcing Tanween Shaping will not only prevent connection with the following word in case a space goes missing but will also lessen the importance of preceding the following word with a space as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tanween is possible to do on font level without changing Uniscribe,

</blockquote>
<p>Contextual substitution based on first letter of following word?!
Since the following word is preceded by a space, then am I right to conclude that:
1 Justification is not possible by swashing though (Overlapped) Swashing is VOLTable.
2 en and em spaces (narrower or wider), are VOLT-Controlled also?</p>
<p>Hope Uniscribe Rules will be modified to make life easier for VOL(un)Teers.</p>

<li>Katia, we — Communication Engineers— define Information as the logarithm of the inverse of the likelihood (p)robability) of the news (data). Mathematically,  Information (in Bits)= 10 log 1/p</li>

<p>So, a likely event carries no information, like the sun will rise tomorrow.
Similarly, the less likely the event, the more informative!

Excuse my curiosity but how can a communication engineer be interested in designing and developing fonts?
I’m still 25 years old and as u know I hold a Masters degree in Information systems. I live in lebanon while my family work and live in the ivory coast. after university all I wanted was to work in my major, I worked as a freelancer, I worked with the UN, etc. finally i ended up working with fonts, which I found not interesting.</p>

<p>Well Katia, Font Making is like Baby Making in the womb of a lady.
It starts with pains and ends up with birth pangs to deliver a well-made one?!
Some ladies hate it. Others love it. Still others pay thousands of U$ to experience it.
But for sure, it is the companion that makes the journey sweet or bitter?!</p>
<p>University degree just helps you step to the bottom of the ladder and you have to climb up to the top. There, you learned nothing but problem-solving techniques applicable to Info Systems and Fonts as well. So, it is you who translates that into workable ideas wherever and whenever needed from you. Only there and then, you will discover yourself&hellip;
But keep in mind that &quot; A creative ABC Teacher is better than a useless Ph.Doctor.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although all my own Arabic work has been in OpenType, I’m pretty convinced that only an approach like Tom’s can result in optimal mark positioning. The downside of such a system is that it tends to be very slow: not something you would want to use for, e.g. e-mail. But in the context of book production, it is the best thing available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not based on actual observation. The core code for ACE was written in 1984 for 4Mhz processors :-)
See: <a href="http://laits.utexas.edu/rfpit/texts/Mimesis.html">http://laits.utexas.edu/rfpit/texts/Mimesis.html</a></p>
<p>Today it runs on 1Ghz, 2Ghz or even faster computers. ACE has never been slow, and it&rsquo;s certainly faster than OpenType.</p>
<p>Moreover, what&rsquo;s wrong with elegant email. Ruqah, one of our projects, is perfect for (e)mail. Anyway, ACE is technology, not a specific font.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I believe the problem is that your cursive connection GPOS feature has the marks flag set to something other than NONE, probably all. Every OpenType Layout lookup has a flag that indicates whether all marks, no mark or a class of marks should be processed as part of the lookup. For features that involve interaction between adjacent letter shapes, such as ligature GSUB features and cursive attachment GPOS features, you want to set the marks flag to NONE. This means that marks in the glyph sequence will be ignored by this lookup. [Note that, obviously, this means that mark glyphs need to be classified as Marks in the VOLT glyph data.]</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that there are a couple of different situations in which you want this ligature not to form; when any mark follows the mim but perhaps also when a mark occurs below the lam?</p>
<p>What you need to do in this case is create some separate lookups for this ligature, and a class for lower marks called e.g. &lsquo;marks_below&rsquo;, and another class for &lsquo;all_marks&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Your first lookup will form the ligature only if no below mark follows the lam. This is done by putting the &lsquo;marks_below&rsquo; class name in the Process Marks field:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/LM1_5027.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p>The second lookup decomposes the ligature when the mim is followed by a mark. This requires the Process Marks field to be set to ALL, so that the &lsquo;all_marks&rsquo; class will be recognised in the context string:</p>

I am marking glyph definition ligature 2 component and use anchor attachment but it is not working on MS word. Happening situation is fig: 2, fig:3</p>
<p>My previous post i learned lot of works in volt and succeed init, medi and fina change the baselineshift and word rising the desired ligature as fig; 1 i thank ful to you but the diacritic mark  is not working on it. What happened.</p>
<p>I need to know if there is a way to de-ligate the Lam-Meem ligature when I put a mark on the Meem so that, when I put the mark for the Meem, the ligature is back seperated to Lam (initial) and Meem (medial), so the mark doesn&rsquo;t like it&rsquo;s the Lam&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Plz describe the detail with screen shot if you don&rsquo;t mind i understand that is not your job it is merly your kindness yours suggestion is very helpful for me, font is very flat that has a great impact for urdu audience, designer support layout font.</p>

<p>I am not at all familiar with other forums but I like the way that relationships develop on this one, it feels like a local (pub) where everyone knows your name, or at least your handle. I have yet to decide whether that is a good or a bad thing, it generally feels good though.</p>
<p>Pushing this back to the topic (at least a little bit), are there any clearly established guides to using VOLT, independent of this and Microsoft&rsquo;s site?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeh barree is very difficult in OpenType, because there is no way to kern the yeh barree against the letter with which it is colliding on the right, because of all the intervening letters. OpenType GPOS simply isn&rsquo;t a good format for handling this kind of problem (which is one that I will be discussing in my presentation at TypeCon next week). You can only kern adjacent glyphs, so in order to handle these situations you would need to have a contextual kern between the final letter in the previous word and the following space glyph, in which the context is everything up to and including the yeh barree. It&rsquo;s a nightmare. Also note that some browsers treat each word as a separate glyph run, so context lookups across word spaces might not work even if you made them. As I said, a nightmare. Oh, and if you were to build all of the separate contextual lookups necessary to handle all the variable spacing contexts, chances are that you would overflow the GPOS subtable boundaries and the font wouldn&rsquo;t compile. Did I mention that this is a nightmare?</div>

Save your VOLT project ( e.g. AVolt.vfp )
Remove your {R_L_6} group from mark feature. Try to compile - if it compile, save your project as AVolt_1.vfp.
Open again project AVolt.vfp. Remove all features but mark and remove all groups but {R_L_6}, {AA}, {BB}. Try to compile - if it compile, save your project as AVolt_2.vfp. If not find errors and repeare. When you have compiled AVolt_2.vfp project generate AVolt_1.ttf and AVolt_2.ttf files and extract feature files from them AVolt_1.fea and AVolt_2.fea. Merge these two .fea files and make your final font.</div>

This is the first thing to try when you encounter an unexplained compilation failure, which are most commonly caused by subtable overruns, i.e. your GSUB or GPOS data is too large to be compiled to a single subtable. Using the extension lookups mechanism often solves this, although if the problem is with GPOS data this can be more difficult.</div>

<p>The subtable size limit is not some particular number of attachment points or lookup entries, but is a byte size limit. So you should try to make your GPOS lookups as efficient as possible, e.g. try to share anchor attachment points for different marks as far as possible.</p>
<p>An Arabic font that relies heavily on ligatures instead of contextual variants is always going to require more GPOS anchor points.</p>

<p>Distribute in different GSUB and GPOS  but not achieved my purpose. I try according by your second paragraph no solved my problems.</p>
<p>Ligatures must be include in this project that the nuqta placement and barri yeh positioning is best way to put nuqtas in ligatures,  instead of contextual alternate and nuqta placement is so difficult in urdu Nastaleeq. So i think best way to required some more frequently ligature include my project. I have no idea encounter compiler issue.</p>
