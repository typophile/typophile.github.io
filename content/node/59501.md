body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nBeen [re-]designing this logo for awhile. The firm is [removed
  by moderator]...and their focus is helping small businesses succeed, freelancers
  included. They are currently expanding, and developing an online presence....hence
  the need for a stronger logo. They offer:\r\n\r\n-Consulting services\r\n-Organizational
  psychology resources\r\n-Analysis\r\n-Efficiency standards\r\n-Accounting\r\n-Marketing\r\n-Business
  management advice: growth, profitability, maximum efficiency\r\n\r\nEverything targets
  small to medium-sized business owners. Their name is similar to the word 'innovation'
  for the fact that most of their ideas are copyrighted and unique. Very effective
  business management information, trade secrets. They're innovative, with the intent
  of using that innovation for the betterment of their clients. They like making things
  better.\r\n\r\nI tried as hard as I could to come up with a logomark; no luck. I'm
  suffering from creative blocks. If anyone has ideas as to what a symbol could be,
  or might best represent from the above info, that would be lovely, and very appreciated.\r\n\r\nSo
  here's what I have: two different directions. I'd still love a logomark, but....type-only
  seems to be my best bet. Thoughts??\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think. Thanks!\r\n[link

  body: "It needs more \"innovation.\" What you have right now is just word(s) with
    little emotional attachment to the idea of innovation. What if you turn the last
    \"i\" upside down into an exclamation point? Be aware that such approaches have
    been done before so make sure to do a bit of homework and think about what would
    be the best way of creating a feeling of \"innovation\" without being clich\xE9.
    And if nothing seems to be working, take a break, and later come back and brainstorm,
    throwing all your ideas (even the crazy and impractical ones) down on to a piece
    of paper. Then identify the top 2-3 ideas and start refining those into practical
    concepts.\r\n\r\nGood luck."

  body: "This is a better concept then the previous approaches. But...\r\n\r\nThe
    butterfly is a bit too lifeless and the position seems out of synch and unbalanced
    with the letters. In fact the font is a bit lifeless as well. Must it be all caps?\r\n\r\nGood
    job on capturing the qualities you want to represent in the logo! Think about
    how type could transform (or go from negative to positive) - try out some more
    of those qualities and think how you could depict them."

    of innovation: breaking away from traditional thought, going in a new and different
    direction. Independence. Not following the crowd, not following 'the status quo.'
    Also: new-found confidence in self.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, please let me know what you

  body: "I much prefer the previous version at 11.Jul.2009 10.44am. To me, it nicely
    illustrated the concept of going against the stream which is completely lost in
    the last sketch. As penn said, the mark should be a lot smaller in relation to
    the type. Maybe, the single fish could even work as the dot on the i in innovien.
    \r\n\r\nThe type treatment still needs exploring, but I like the abstract fish
    shape - interesting.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to see where this is going.\r\n\r\nSeb "

    that's confusing. \r\n\r\nI think the concept of an individual something tearing
    away from the group is solid, but it needs simpler execution. Using fancy shape
    makes it harder to see the actual concept."

  body: This is a step back I think, even concept-wise. The ladder implies slow, laborious
    process. The concept of upward motion is fitting though. Perhaps consider something

    is a logo centered around new thoughts, helping clients succeed, consulting, et

    could be adjusted....darnit. :) I really liked this one. I'll see what inspires
    me from that example you linked to and get back to you [and everyone else] with

    around with the idea of radiance going vertically or horizontally. \r\n\r\nLove
