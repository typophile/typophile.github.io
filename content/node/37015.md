  The print turned out a tad too big, but other than that I really like how it turned
  out.\r\n\r\nI'll make you guys'n'gals proud. Well, actually it'll be lads'n'lasses
  as it's in Great Brittain. ;^)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Transatlantic_crew_3673.jpg]"

  body: "I was just watching a concert in Brighton by a rather hypnotic one-man band
    called Fat Boy Slim. I had never heard of him (or Brighton for that matter), and
    it looked like everyone within a hundred miles was there gyrating to the music.
    Quite fascinating.\r\n\r\nBtw, great shirt. \r\n\r\nI still haven't received my
    Typophile shirt, and guess it is lost at this point. I have something coming up
    I wanted to have it for, but Joe isn't taking my calls to try and find out what
    happened."
