  is on some Verbose Mode viewing instructions.  This allows the user to view the
  coding style text  and not the Graphics Mode.  I am not a font designer thus the
  question one here:  Is the Verbose Mode font on the Linux distribution, circa 2011
  a bitmap?\r\n\r\nThe Verbose Mode de facto gives the 'coder perception'.  I am not
  a font coder, thus the question two here:  Where is the Verbose Mode font and the
  coding style text that have font attributes (colour/italics/bold/lower/upper?) installed
  on the Linux operating system and is it easy to alter it to another font and the
  coding style text including the font attributes, circa 2011?"

    fully booting into whatever operating system it's loading. It's not accessing
    any installed software yet.\r\n\r\nAlso, please go away. "

  body: "If my understanding is correct, there is a point during boot where the console
    font is explicitly set by the kernel. If you search for terms like \"linux console
    font\" you might find more information. I know that there are fonts stored in
    /usr/share/consolefonts on my Ubuntu system and that using the \"setfont\" command
    from a console screen (the screen you get when you hold down CTRL-ALT-F1, for
    example) can change the font.  You can type \"man setfont\" for documentation.
    Good luck!\r\n\r\nst\r\n\r\nP.S. Usually, holding down ALT-F7 will get you back
    to the graphical desktop from the console. And a warning: I've had systems where
    switching to console and back was dicey and tended to put the system's video card
    into a bad state. But on most it works fine."

  body: On my Linux box (based on Linux From Scratch 5.1), it's when running <code>/etc/rc.d/init.d/loadkeys</code>,
    when it loads the <code>lat1-16</code> bitmap font from <code>/usr/share/kbd/consolefonts</code>.
