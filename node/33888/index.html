Hmmm&hellip;that&rsquo;s just your personal view right? Everyone has a right to express their views but Islam has always been strong. It;s only because of 9/11 and Iraq and terrorism blamed on Muslims that seems to be &lsquo;picking up&rsquo; well. It always has done. Well, that&rsquo;s what I think.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Paul, if we were allowed to rate answers - I&rsquo;d give yours a 10+.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of the most successful advertising campaigns EVER in the United States was for Piels beer. That&rsquo;s right - the beer that tastes like crap. Fortunately, good sense followed after everyone tasted it, and knew it was crap. (But working my way as a waitress in a Steak &amp; Brew - all beer was crap to me!!! LOL) Comedians Bob &amp; Ray (oh my, you are probably too young to even know about them!) were hired for spot announcements and commercials - in fact, I don&rsquo;t have to write about it - someone did that for on on Wikipedia &ndash; over here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piels_Beer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piels_Beer</a>  &ndash; now that was strength in advertising&hellip;</p>
<p>As for campaigns that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed</p>
<ol>
<li>Chivas Regal - a photo of a photostudio table that was empty - and a notice that it was too good to waste.</li>
<li>Fred and Ginger in a dance pose - and the caption - remember when all you needed was talent.</li>
</ol>
<p>In recent years - I&rsquo;d say Budweiser. But I may be prejudice &ndash; it was one of my neighbors who came up with that one.</p>
<p>Or that EOS (?) car in Europe - those television spots are incredible. Though Bentley has been cute lately with the slogan &ldquo;For When Your Penis Is Just Too Small&rdquo; &ndash; LOL</p>
<p>If you can get 10% of the population to try your product because of your campaign - then you have truly had a successful run.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Coca—Cola wins, although I don’t see the company as having different campaigns as opposed to one insane and unyielding effort to blanket the world in marketing. From what I’ve read that company is barely able to quantify the success or failure of individual ads or series of ads because there is literally too much Coke advertising to track it all anymore. As I pointed out in one of your other threads, Coke advertising is the only product campaign to ever near the level of placement that a true propaganda campaign requires, and that’s tough to do.</p>
<p>Another great series of campaigns are the ones that the (American) National Football League did in the 1960s and 1970s to sell advertising to businesses. Those turned the NFL from a scruffy underdog into an indomitable juggernaut, and many people are not aware that they even existed. I don’t know if you can get access to them in the UK, but NFL Films did some great films for the NFL that really broke a lot of new ground in terms of sounds an cinematography.</p>

<p>Yes, originally. It seems that it still has the coca leaf in it, but no significant amount of cocaine. See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola">wikipedia article,</a> on the history of Coca Cola. It still has a lot of caffine.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you’re looking for persuasive propaganda, look at massive campaign in against the Germans that led to US involvement in World War I. The government and the media worked most of the nation up into a fury, ready to fight against the Hun, who were clearly planning to destroy western civilization. Also look into the anti-Japanese campaigns of World War II; those did such a good job of convincing Americans that Japanese men were buck-toothed, violent, psychopathic rapists that the USA had to launch more subtle campaigns after the war to convince Americans that Japanese men were actually effeminate, weak, and poorly endowed.</p>
<p>But it is also important that you realize what true propaganda is and how it differs from advertising. Read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Propaganda-Jacques-Ellul/dp/0394718747/ref=sr_1_1/026-6450326-6351623?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1179669432&sr=8-1">Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Minds</a> by Jacques Ellul.</p>

<p>No, I couldn&rsquo;t say that with a straight face (a little too histrionic), preferring JK Galbraith&rsquo;s &ldquo;consumer advertising provides&hellip;a relentless propaganda on behalf of goods in general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, I would point out that advertising pays for the fourth estate, which is the best antidote there is to the abuse of power.</p>
<p>Also consider that life expectancy, standard of living, pollution rates, and political rights and freedoms are all better in societies where there is more advertising.</p>
<p>Now if only we didn&rsquo;t live on a finite-sized planet, consumerism wouldn&rsquo;t be such a problem.</p>

<p>But to talk about companies - or brands - like Coke, or Nike, or McDonalds in terms of advertising campaigns is only part of the story. It&rsquo;s more about the branding of America.</p>
<p>As far as global influence goes&hellip; you can&rsquo;t leave out ExxonMobilShellGulfBPCitgo etc which bears a tremendous influence both on the way we live (why are cars less fuel efficient now than they were in the 70s) on global politics (Iraq war) and on the environment.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Lindsay,</p>
<p>Welcome to the forums, but I think Miss Giggles is fine in posing this questions here. If her intent is research, then she is conducting a questionaire to gain the insight of others - why can&rsquo;t the Typophile forum be a source of that insight? While I agree that she can&rsquo;t base her entire research on people&rsquo;s resposes (and the reponses), her questions are legit and thought provoking. The point of a forum is to open discussion about a topic - and her topic is relevant to the audience.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;ve been poking around here for a while, you should know that most of the responses are from Typophile veterans who obviously have no problem answering the question at hand.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t the place for asking creative people a to think constructively, then what is?</p>
<p>missgiggles, my short answer is social media such as Myspace, Facebook, and YouTube. These companies don&rsquo;t do any advertising whatsoever yet have millions of hits every day all over the world. I don&rsquo;t think word-of-mouth advertising (or perhaps word-of-keyboard would be more appropriate) has ever been more effective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the UK&rsquo;s Pop Idol, but in the US, more people vote for American Idol than in the US Presidential election - I&rsquo;d say that would be a place to start researching persuasion too.</p>

<p>I’m siding with Miss Giggles. All she has done is ask for advice and opinion, neither of which will get one very far when it comes to serious academic research. Unless she happens to attend some new sort of school where students can pass of a bunch of forum posts as serious academic research (then again, I quoted Erik Spiekermann’s posts in a paper, but it was alongside about a dozen published works.) I think that the vast majority of her thesis work will be done outside of the Typophile forms.</p>

<p>At any rate, one of the most shrewdest, minimalistic, and financially successful of advertising campaigns I have seen in recent years was when Microsoft took out a full page ad in various magazines announcing amnesty to the estimated one million &ldquo;unregistered&rdquo; users of Word. No questions asked, just send in the attached registration form. A couple of months later MS offered the upgrade to the newly released Word 6 at $100 a pop. Sweet.</p>

<p>My last word on the subject (I swear). I have no objection to missgiggles - or anyone - picking our collective brain. What bothers me is (1) the laziness of her posts. They are totally discombobulated both grammatically/linguistically and in terms of content, and often contain questions that could be easily answered by a simple google or wikipedia search; and (2) her inability to respond to constructive criticism - either about her ideas or her writing. Granted there has been some unnecessary flaming, but as I have said before, if she is to expect the kind of thoughtful, reasoned responses she usually gets here, it seems to me she could provide the same courtesy - thoughtful, reasoned queries. I suspect that the collective irritation on the forum has less to do with her &ldquo;inquiring mind&rdquo; than with her attitude.</p>

<p>This image and slogan, and others like it, were copied from this <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Kitchener-Britons.jpg">British original</a>, depicting Lord Kitchener, then head of the British armed forces.

<p>No, these posters were not persuasive enough to get everyone going. Both countries had to introduce conscription.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mormon ad campaigns are pretty strong. They advertise on TV all the time. I just stopped at a historical site in Utah that had a &ldquo;free&rdquo; tour and it turned out that the site was owned by the LDS church and the tour was led by a Mormon missionary who was very careful not to be blatant but was just waiting for an opening to do his &ldquo;thing&rdquo;. It was actually very interesting.</p>
<p>Coke and beer is popular in Sardinia. Don&rsquo;t remember the name of the drink though…</p>
<p>MsGiggles - Your statement where you quote me about Islam is a form of unjust persecution. I said nothing negative about Islam. I just believe at this time it is probably the fastest growing religion in the world.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to get persecuted unjustly then desist from that activity.</p>
<p>BTW - I am on your side - you can ask any question you want in any form you want and I have absolutely no problem with it. I hope the same is true for my answers to your questions. Of course there are limits…</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it organized (Hrant might think otherwise) but the snowball effect of the campaign for capitalism has no equal, ever.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re not a fan of ad campaigns MsGiggles because makng people think they need something that&rsquo;s unnecessary is a real tragedy.</p>
<p>Now on to the next campaign… :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in advertising and don&rsquo;t feel guilty about it - but I also know that it is nothing more than propaganda. I am not deluded about the machine I work for and it&rsquo;s ethics.</p>
<p>Yet - I&rsquo;m lucky that I get to do something creative for a living in this society that I have never quite felt a part of.</p>
<p>All lives are compromised - I was reminded of this recently when a friend of mine had a &ldquo;break&rdquo;. His subconscious came bubbling forth without constraints from the social contract. It was a very confusing thing for him and I believe he will learn something valuable from it.</p>

<p>dear, i&rsquo;m probably old enough to be your gran.</p>
<p>you might find it useful to show some respect.  if you ever want to get a job, you might want to think of this place as somewhere that you might find someone who would hire you.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve looked at some of your postings and if you ever applied for a job with our company, i wouldn&rsquo;t pay you to clean the loo. you are very rude.</p>
<p>why are you want to tell people they are stupid when they are trying to help you? i don&rsquo;t understand this. when i was your age, i was polite, and you do not seem to know that sometimes when you are starting out, you need to say &lsquo;please&rsquo; and &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to people who share what they know.</p>
<p>i haven&rsquo;t seen you do this. all you do is tell people they are mean. they are quite polite until you tell them they are useless. you may not have noticed but they are also starting to make fun of you. when people start to make fun of you, it is because they are not taking you seriously.</p>
<p>you might want to reconsider why you are doing this.</p>
<p>my grandkids tell me that the standards we had here in england are not what they used to be. from seeing what you write, they may be correct.</p>
<p>i am old, and it is late here.  but i would like to think that young people can still do what is right.</p>

I&rsquo;ll just leave you all with one question: has it ever occured to anyone Miss Giggles might not be the lazy student a lot of people here seem to think, but merely a devoted student who is only trying to open her mind to other people&rsquo;s opinions? Since when is devotion &amp; being eager to learn a crime? It&rsquo;s a matter of giving someone the benifit of the doubt. People may accuse her of being rude, but I&rsquo;ve seen Miss Giggles pop up in many threads now &amp; I was never under the impression she was lazy or rude. And even if she would be, that just might be a simple case of action/reaction. I like her threads &amp; I have seen a lot of similar questions posted on Typophile by non-students. Don&rsquo;t use her position against her, we all started at the bottom &amp; I can only encourage her to keep taking part in discussion &amp; posting new threads. I see this as a passion for the subject &amp; an interest in her fellow Typophilers. If anything, I&rsquo;m flattered to see someone validates my opinion.</div>

If people do not like my threads or my manners or my attitude or personality or  the way I may portray myself on Typophile, then that is perfectly fine by me. You don&rsquo;t have to talk to me or post on my threads or even glance at my threads but you do so thank you ever so much :) I kindly appreciate everyone&rsquo;s opinions, ideas and views. It&rsquo;s only when people go too far as to, in one post make me feel as though I was responsible for someone&rsquo;s poor dog passing away. Now, that is way beyond preportion. So is that acceptable? No! Then I just have to defend myself and backfire when necessary. Other than that, i don&rsquo;t really understand what i do wrong and if I have done wrong in the past, then I ask for forgiveness and I am sorry but for the times when it wasn&rsquo;t even my fault, i&rsquo;m not going to say sorry because I haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong and don&rsquo;t need to feel guilty about anything I havn&rsquo;t even done! :)</div>

I didn&rsquo;t want to make any comment on this at first (as you can read from Pattyfab&rsquo;s post I&rsquo;m already entangled in a web of misinterpretations &amp; (false*) accusations in another thread), but I just couldn&rsquo;t take the injustice anymore &amp; at one point I actually felt ill in your place as well. But like you said, you meet all kinds of people in your life.
My advice is to try and see all this as a learning school as well, that might help you to deal better with it &amp; -I don&rsquo;t want to scare you off now ;-) - prepare you for similar misinterpretations you&rsquo;ll often have to deal with in graphic design. Sure, a picture can say more than a thousand words, but the more words it says the more room it leaves for misinterpretation&hellip; Every explanation is an open invitation to misinterpretation. Just stand your ground &amp; absorb the comments that you find appropriate &amp; helpful.
BTW: I really enjoy your threads which are usually just about personal taste/interpretations. It&rsquo;s nice to see what other people can come up with &amp; you can learn a lot from those replies (the Uncle Sam poster is a great example). It&rsquo;s also nice as a reminder; you often &ldquo;forget&rdquo; things and when someone else posts it here it can bring back nice memories.
Keep up the good work &amp; good luck with your studies!</p>
<p>*some people will surely disagree with this word hence the use of parens</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>MissGiggles - I can relate! Especially about the &ldquo;World war 3&rdquo; comment. :-) And I&rsquo;ve also felt bullied to the point of feeling truly sad, particularly since this was supposed to be a fun, positive thing. I don&rsquo;t think people intentionally decides to join a forum just to create a negative and aggressive situation. I assume most of us do it because we want to be inspired, learn things and/or get some help, often in an area where we have little or no expertis.
And naturally one should show gratitude to every single person who has taken the energy and time to share his/hers opinion and/or advice. But speaking from my own experience with the whole enfant terrible mess, I feel that it hasn&rsquo;t been okay  to say &ldquo;thank you but no thank you&rdquo; when an idea has been presented to me that I didn&rsquo;t like. Just because I don&rsquo;t feel something is right for me doesn&rsquo;t take anything away from that person&rsquo;s creativity or intelligence. Some suggestions to my particular problem have been absolutely brilliant and I could see them working perfectly in a different context, but not in mine.</p>
<p>A lot of people in this forum say &ldquo;if you put yourself out there and start a thread and ask for advice, you&rsquo;d better be prepared to get criticized and get some harsh comments&rdquo;. But what about the other way around? If people share their idea/advice/opinion with the person who started the thread, shouldn&rsquo;t they be as prepared for criticism or rejection? And shouldn&rsquo;t they be able to take it without getting irritated or angry?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;if you are hearing the same comments/criticisms over and over again, perhaps it is worth paying attention to them, rather than assuming everyone else is wrong and/or out to get you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general I totally agree with Pattyfab, don&rsquo;t know enough about MissGiggles to say that it applies on her, but in this thread I don&rsquo;t think she has behaved badly at all. But I do think this is mostly true when it comes to how people behave, not necessarily about their opinions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>your last post wouln’t be completely out of place in a different thread (you know which one I mean).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume that you&rsquo;re talking about me and my thread, if you&rsquo;re not, I apologize.  :-)  But Tom, if you&rsquo;re talking about my thread, can&rsquo;t you see that you have a little bit of a double standard here? Apparently MissGiggles have gotten a lot of critic so how come Pattyfab&rsquo;s comment doesn&rsquo;t apply to MissGiggles but to me? Shouldn&rsquo;t she be able &ldquo;to do the math&rdquo; like I&rsquo;ve been told? In all fairness, what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Charlotta, the difference is that your idea of what an enfant terrible is has clouded your ability to do the math. It was pretty clear from the beginning you had no intentions of taking any given advice into account (you&rsquo;ve clearly stated so yourself that it was your interpretation that mattered and none of us could make you change your mind about that). The math problem in your thread was not about anything personal (as it is here), but trying to make you see that it didn&rsquo;t matter what you -or any other single  person for that matter- thought of an enfant terrible, but it is (or at least should be if you want to be an entrepreneur) about what your potential customers think of it. I simply said that -if the Typophile board is at all a little representive for society- you should&rsquo;ve made the conclusion from your own comment that the majority linked it to things you didn&rsquo;t find appropriate for your jewelry that maybe enfant terrible might not be the best chosen name for your jewelry line.
The difference is that Miss Giggles has not commented in a negative way about the replies she got from people who were also only trying to help her.
The difference is that Miss Giggles seems to have (I don&rsquo;t want to make any more assumptions here) an open mind which sadly could not be said from you. In all your raving about being independent you conveniently forgot that 1. you asked for our opinions, but didn&rsquo;t take any of them into account since you were determined about your ideas from the start (which makes one wonder why you reached out for help) because you &ldquo;are&rdquo; an enfant terrible &amp; independent &amp; 2. after over 200 replies &amp; repeatedly having said you are new to all this, you dismiss all advice as unsuitable ideas, but the fact that there&rsquo;s a major difference between advice &amp; ideas never accured to you.
About the double standard, I think that only apllies to Pattyfab here. She accused me of making untrue accusations when -again- I was merely being analytical &amp; observative. Too bad she lacks Lore&rsquo;s &ldquo;sense of humour&rdquo; or maybe she could see the irony in all this.
Sorry MissGiggles that even here the enfant terrible mess got the better of some of us, but I think no one can accuse me of throwing the first stone this time.</div>

<p>That&rsquo;s interesting how you can defend a person who feels like she&rsquo;s been bullied and in the same thread you&rsquo;re being a bully to someone else. Be respectful enough to reply to a respectful message in the same manner. At least. And as for the rest. You still don&rsquo;t have a clue what you&rsquo;re talking about. I&rsquo;d written you a very long email filled with apologies and explanations so that you would understand me better and we could be friends. Now I am glad you didn&rsquo;t receive it. Especially since you&rsquo;ve been nice to me the last couple of days and then you write a comment like that about me in another thread? That&rsquo;s pretty  much stabbing me in the back. Maybe you should be a bit more careful about what you criticize Lore for.</p>

Does that make you feel good? Was it your ambition in life to grow up to be a jerk? My guess is that you probably were the person who were bullied and now you take it out on innocent people.

<p>Travel, travel, travel. But make the journey inside yourself and see if you can&rsquo;t find a shred of common decency and kindness somewhere. And grow a back bone, for crying out loud. If you&rsquo;re going to continue to harrass people and be mean and insulting at least have the balls to show your face or your name or where you&rsquo;re coming from.</p>

I HAVE DEPRESSION AND I CAN&rsquo;T BELIEVE THAT A WEBSITE WHICH IS MEANT TO BE EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL HAS TURNED SO SOUR, SO NASTY AND SO HORRIBLE! I just don&rsquo;t know waht to say. This is causing me and has caused me in the past in my other threads too much distress. Sorry for the capitalisation but that is how I feel. Sorry for everything (even though it isn&rsquo;t me!) and sorry for even joining Typophile. Thank you Ill Sans :) I love you for sticking up for me and thank you to all who have supported me. I wish I could get away from this site but my love for type and design will not allow me but I really have had enough. As adults, we should know what is right and what is wrong. I am goign to ignore the <em>swear word</em> people on here who think they can ruin everyone&rsquo;s lives. Well, FCUK you! Enough said, thank you :)
ps sorry for the bad language. Just shows, I have never sworn in my life and you can imagine how much this has driven me to the end of my tether to swear. Now are you going to complain about that too now eh? Well go ahead or FCUK yourself!</div>

What I really enjoy THESE days is fishing. Anyone here like fishing?</div>

<p>About the only thing I&rsquo;ve read lately is &ldquo;Flickr Hacks&rdquo; since I&rsquo;m trying to do more with my page, which is really pretty sad.  I guess it would help if I was better at taking pictures.</p>
<p>Patty: I don&rsquo;t think you can find Bles-Wold outside of southern Alberta, but it makes the most wonderful addition to curries.</p>
<p>And if you drain it for awhile, it&rsquo;s just the best thing to put on bagels.</p>
