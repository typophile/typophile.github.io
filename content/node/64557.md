  invitation. i've been through dozens and dozens at this point, and i'm finally feeling
  good about where we're at. (exact spacing/kerning/leading yet to be done - i wanted
  to get the general thing good enough, then move on to those details). thoughts?
  thank you!\r\n\r\n"

    invitation with centered formal script, I wonder if you have yet achieved something
    that communicates a marriage of 2 people.\r\nFor me, what you have done, looks
    like a cutsheet of rigid old-school magazine ads.\r\nI think you have to loosen
    up and be a bit more personal with it--put some love in it. Make it look like
    a happy union of two people, not an overly tight exercise in spacing and leading.\r\n\r\nMake
    a break from both tradition and rigidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Hi Lauren,\r\nlove it, what a refreshing break from the usual sentimental
    stuff. \r\nAs you're both in the magazine world it fits great. \r\n\r\nFor me
    the second line doesn't sit well, extending wider than the rest it breaks the
    flow, given that magazine layout is the inspiration the left and right margins
    should align, this would help reinforce the magazine inspiration.\r\n\r\nHaving
    designed my own wedding invitations, recently, I know how hard it is to finally
    sign them off.\r\n\r\nA small idea...\r\nBeing in the magazine world hopefully
    you know some good copywriters, adding a short sharp paragraph at the beginning/end
    would help balance the layout on the page. It could also give it a more personal
    feel and show off one of the most underrated skills in the design world, that
    of good copywriting.\r\n\r\nCongratulations on the big day hope it goes well.\r\nMartin\r\n\r\nP.S.
    keep the Mums away from the champagne early on. (I know this from experience!)"

  body: "What Chris said. I like dry champagne at weddings, but I think an invitation
    should have more playfulness, more joy. This is not just another design job.\r\n\r\nWhat
    to do? All I can think of might be too cheesy: bring the tail of the \"R\" in
    \"LAUREN\" all the way down to merge with the \"R\" in \"ANDREI\". The angles
    are actually lining up quite well as is!\r\n\r\nOne other thing: you (and especially
    your parents) I don't think are getting enough \"respect\" here. This is an issue
    not just of fairness (no matter who's paying for what) but your future collective
    happiness as well.\r\n\r\n> keep the Mums away from the champagne\r\n\r\nAh!\r\n\"Don't
    serve mums Mums.\"\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    By this I mean: won\u2019t it be safer to write April 24th and 5:30?\r\nWhat do

    \"More Information\", leaving just the domain. And if you can get a top-level
    domain less materialistic than \".com\" that would be nicer. Sorry if I'm sounding

  body: "I give you respect for designing your own invitations. I tried and nothing
    clicked so we opted for another route. \r\n\r\nI do want to mention one thing.
    To me, the typeface (Miller?) says \"newspaper\" more than it says \"magazine\".
    (Perhaps one of you works for a news magazine?) \r\n\r\nIn its current state,
    I would be very surprised if guests pick up on any nod to the magazine world.
    Unless Miller is a signature typeface in a publication for which one of you work.
    It looks most like a font specimen or 19th-century advertising.\r\n\r\nJust a
    thought. "
