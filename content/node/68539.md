  need to learn if I was to consider working at a TV station and I was responsible
  for graphics overlayed on the live picture, like in News Story broadcasts, score
  boards, tickers etc etc etc \r\n\r\n"

  body: David is right on, After Effects is the big one for motion graphics with Photoshop
    and Illustrator always necessary as well as some sort of editing package. I don't
    know of a lot of places using Motion though.

    Motion isn't a stand-alone product, but part of the Final Cut Studio suite; and
    \  no problem to integrate Motion files/projects with After Effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Most broadcasting companies will use custom built software and hardware specific
    to their broadcast technology - that is to produce those live feeds with information,
    and overlaying credits. This is generally done in real-time - the mainstream applications
    are more for post production, special effects etc - which render out a self contained
    movie. News stories, scoreboard graphics etc deal with real time feeds so need
    a punchier system, and i wouldn't expect to see one of these outside of the studio
    it's used for.\r\n\r\nIt uses the same sort of interface metaphors as mainstream
    applications though. Timelines, layers, importing footage, alpha etc etc. So any
    editing/composition software (Purple, Avid, Premiere) will give you adequate experience."
