body: Does anyone have a brilliant idea for a display typeface to use with Trump Medieval?
  This is for the title page of a book which is set in Trump. The chapter titles look
  well at 15pt, but I find that at the 26 point size I want on the title page, it
  turns to blob. It needs to be a serif face that will talk nicely and elegantly to
  Trump without calling too much attention to itself.
