  body: Hi. I don&#39;t know much at all about designing typefaces. I posted my first
    attempt last week. So take my posting with a huge grain of salt.  <BR> <BR>There
    are some details I love. The way the descender of the upper case q meets the base
    of the capital r is very nice. But they are different widths. I wonder how it
    would look if the width were the same. Also, the upper stroke of the upper case
    x next the the upper stroke of the upper case y looks awkward. Maybe its just
    that they are so close together. But since they are, the angle of the x looks
    a little awkward. <BR> <BR>Its a REALLY nice typeface.

  body: Thanks for replying Therese. And I need add no salt to your reply. Judging
    by the font you posted, you know more about font design than you let on. I really
    liked your design and look forward to seeing more of it as you go along, so keep
    us posted. I usually don&#39;t respond when all I can say is &#34;Wow, that&#39;s
    cool.&#34; I hope to keep learning and someday get to the point I feel confident
    to dish out advice. <BR> <BR>I made the fixes you suggested. I hope the &#34;XY&#34;
    problem was a spacing issue.&#40;I was only about half way done with kerning when
    I posted the PDF. Oops.&#41; Let me know.  <BR>Thanks, <BR>Jeff <BR> <BR><img

  body: Looking at the PDF, the uppercase &#39;M&#39;, &#39;N&#39;, &#39;V&#39; and
    &#39;W&#39;, and the lowercase &#39;v&#39; and &#39;w&#39;, doesnt seem to match
    / work with the other, rounder, more organic letter forms.. I think the &#39;cutted&#39;,
    angular ends of &#39;v&#39;, &#39;w&#39;, &#39;V&#39; and &#39;W&#39; dont really
    help, either.. &#40; Maybe try one, alternate version, without these modifications..
    &#41; <BR> <BR>A good start, and a nice &#39;first one&#39;, nonetheless.. <IMG

  body: Would you post some examples of it in use? The charcters look quite wacky
    to me in isolation but in the red sentance they have a nice flow. The irregularity
    seems to work. Still, I&#39;d like to see more.

  body: 'I&#39;m sorry for the lateness of my reply. I have a different job now that
    allows less time to follow the forum.  <BR> <BR>The characters are definitely
    quite wacky. At this point in time I am more interested in experimenting with
    new shapes than trying to create the most readable text font.  <BR> <BR>What sort
    of examples are you looking for? If you are just looking for certain letter combinations
    you can try them out at MyFonts.com: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lomaxdesign/maximo/"

    with a little more time I can post some examples.'
