  body: This resembles Tamil &#40;p.158 in Solotype catalog published by Dover Books&#41;.
    The showing is incomplete, so I can&#39;t see enough letters to confirm it.  <BR>
    <BR>I cannot find a showing of it online, mainly because Tamil is also a language,
    with it&#39;s own fonts. <BR> <BR>However, closer investigation shows Tamil to
    be a more square typeface than this. It has very similar serifs though.

  body: I think Konami is big enough a company to afford its  <BR>own custom-designed
    logo and/or corporate typeface. <BR>I could be wrong though.

    you find the time to scan and post, don&#39;t  <BR>do it just for me&#41;.

  body: The Solotype Catalog Tamil differs from the logo image in several ways. <BR>I&#39;d
    post a scan, but I bet Mike Y is working that up right now. <BR> <BR>Thought I&#39;d
    mention, though, that Dieter Steffmann digitized the Black and <BR>Outline variants
    of Tamil under the name <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/t/tobago.htm"
    target="_blank"> Tobago Poster</a> &#40;Win TT/T1 only&#41;. <BR> <BR>The Catalog
    shows 6 weights of Tamil, Light through Heavy, and I think <BR>Herr Steffmann
    chose the nicest and most potentially useful of them to <BR>digitize. <BR><br>

  body: You&#39;re right Mike, except I had Novel Fonts &#34;Tamago&#34; which is
    Tamil Black, I think, so I decided not to try to scan the partial samples in the
    Solotype Catalog. Here is that font.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23879.gif"

    win them all ;-&#41;

    hoping to pull out an obscure one, but no luck.
