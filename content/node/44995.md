  and extra leading needs to be specified? I\xB4m thinking to use it to design the
  Ruskin Gallery\xB4s wayfinding.\r\n\r\nThanks for any possible feedback\r\nLaura"

    to using Gill Sans in wayfinding?\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage would be how over-used
    it is, especially in England and especially in museums in England. :^/ But that
    might be neither here nor there in comparison to real disadvantages seen by others."

  body: " Thank you Miss Tiffany,\r\nMy English is terrible and it is a challenge
    for me to write in such as blog. I\xB4m taking an intensive English course over
    the summer! Then, I will be able to write proper English, I hope. \r\n\r\nI completely
    agree with your comments. Another optional font I am thinking to use is  Edward
    Johnston\xB4s P22 Underground; he designed it to be used in London Underground.
    Do you think that it would be wrong to use it?\r\n\r\nThank you once again\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It is for a student project and I cann\xB4t afford to buy the type though
    i\xB4ve mention Bliss and Arrival on my research development.\r\n\r\nThe Gallery
    shows Fine Art and Illustration work. Colours are not specify though the university
    plays with white and dark blue. However, I consider that Ruskin Gallery should
    be independent and have its own identity.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/B
    (4)_6653.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_0787_4863.JPG]\r\n\r\nWell,
    as you can see. They use New Gothic Font. The Wayfinding for Ruskin Gallery is
    just...really bad. The whole university started as \"School of Art\" in 1858 but,
    just recently has changed its name to Anglia Ruskin University. \r\n\r\nThis is
    one of the reasons for what I thought to give it a more personal look to the signage
    would be appropiate it.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I\xB4m trying to simplify this idea,
    make it more contemporary but with a hint of the Arts & Crafts Movement.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Signage

    similar, if you are struck by Gill you might choose the Alt One version; the weights
    are hugely different it almost needs a semi-weight in between each.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Thanks, I\xB4ve decided to use Edward Johnston\xB4s P22 Underground. It gives
    a very elegant touch to the Gallery and the History behind it. As well, I\xB4m
    thinking to use some of the texts extracted from socialist writers in the early
    19 c. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Laura, the forums are a tad slow so if you hit \"post comment\" just once
    it will usually post. ;^) \r\n\r\nIt is understandable that as a student you can't
    afford to license a lot of type. But I do hope you have licensed the weight of
    P22 Underground that you are using. \r\n\r\nIf you put the mark in a box you are
    creating constraints that will only cause you problems later. The box you've used
    really doesn't \"fit\" the shape of the mark even so it ends up just feeling like
    a random box. Additionally, because you are doing wayfinding you'll find that
    some shapes are already forced upon you in the shape of the signs so you'll need
    to be as flexible as possible.\r\n\r\nYou  might benefit from looking at the work
    from Pentagram. \r\n\r\nhttp://pentagram.com/en/portfolio/signage/\r\nhttp://pentagram.com/en/portfolio/marks/\r\nhttp://pentagram.com/en/portfolio/identities/\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Miss Tiffany,\r\nThanks for linking my posts :)\r\nI feel really lucky
    for your support.\r\n\r\nTogether with another mate interested in P22 Underground
    we have bought the typeface. \r\n\r\nI love the links that you have sent me. \r\n\r\nThe
    signage proyect has finished at the moment and I have handed in all my work. I
    wasn\xB4t 100% happy with the results as my time management has not been really
    great! I spent a lot of time in a Graphic Installation as well as in a Live proyect.
    Now, I\xB4m trying to get a placement during summer time. \r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nA
