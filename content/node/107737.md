body: I'm trying to figure out what serif font Roots is using in their Holiday Gift
  Guide 2013 flyer. It seems like the typeface has some slight roughness/degradation
  but I'm not sure if this is because of the paper used. The uppercase 'P' also is
  similar to Palatino in that it does not touch. Can anyone figure this out or let
  me know which typeface might be close?

    it appears to me that someone has digitized a metal specimen and did little-to-no
    cleanup on the outlines, but at least they did do kerning."
