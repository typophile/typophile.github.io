    doing a Google search for\r\n\r\nmgopen site:typophile.com\r\n\r\nwill bring up
    a typophile node that mentions the mgopen fonts, which include a font similar
    to Optima. I haven't ever really looked closely at the quality of MGOpen Cosmetica,
    but I believe it is more ethical to go with an open source option than to go with
    downloading a pirated version of Optima.\r\n\r\nFor non-commercial use, there
    is also a URW version of Optima in the fonts released with GhostPCL:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.artifex.com/downloads/|http://www.artifex.com/downloads/]]\r\n\r\nHere
    are some other Google searches you can perform to find Typophile information on
    good \"free\" fonts, in all the meanings of that word.  I suggest the google searches
    because some of the internal typophile links to its own wiki pages seem to be
    out of date.\r\n\r\ngood libre fonts site:typophile.com\r\n\r\nfaq free site:typophile.com\r\n\r\n\r\nst"

    understanding of the fonts from URW and from the MGOpen collection was that they
    were typefaces released under fairly \"free\" terms from reputable sources. I
    apologize if it wasn't clear that I was limiting my comments to these particular
    options in this particular case.\r\n\r\nIn general, I know that the question of
    when a look-alike typeface is a forgery and when it is a legitimate copy done
    by a legitimate foundry is one that has come up here before, and I certainly don't
    have enough knowledge to be able to add anything to that debate. I'm also not
    suggesting that being licensed as open-source is more important than quality of
    the typeface or whether someone was appropriately paid for their work.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    in this case I did try to do reasonable research into the origins of these typefaces.
    If my understanding of these particular typefaces is incorrect, I would certainly
    like to know it. When a good typeface that is created in an ethical manner is
    given as a gift in this way, I do feel it's appropriate to respect that gift by
    letting others know about it.\r\n\r\nst"
