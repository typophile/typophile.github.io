  body: 'Caecilia works beautifully at text sizes. If you want to go sans, try <a
    href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=thesans">TheSans</a>, which has a very
    similar structure. Serif: <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=TheAntiqua">TheAntiqua</a>.'

    \"naive\" FF Din can work as good contrast for the \"friendly\" Caecilia. "

  body: As a sans counterpart to Caecilia I have used Meta (Medium/Bold/SemiBold)
    a lot. But that was for (sub)captions, because C is a wonderful text face (and
    it can stand some squooshing, eg 94%).
