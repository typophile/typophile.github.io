  ones used by various online font stores. I understand there are numerous options
  using flash but that kerning and open type features are not supported. I also understand
  that their is:\r\n\r\nLettError LetterSetter \r\n\r\nhttp://www.letterror.com/lettersetter/index.html\r\n\r\nwhich
  supports kerning and various features but are there any other options out there?\r\n\r\nHow
  \ important is font testing with online font stores?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"

  body: "Just about every foundry's website has a different spin on type testing.
    One that I found interesting (although I ultimately dislike it) is Wilton Foundry's
    <a href=http://www.fontselect.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=cyan>FontGenerator</a>
    (click on \"View this font in FontGenerator), which displays the sample out of
    moving particles. \r\n\r\nFonts.com's \"Free Text,\" while clunkily implemented,
    gives possibly the most flexibility I've seen, allowing you to specify any point
    size you want as well as the text and background color. It doesn't seem to kern,
    though.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Reminding myself of your original question, for me, some
    way to see the letters up close and personal is extremely important, as I by typefaces
    for both their readability at normal sizes and their quirks at larger sizes. If
    a site doesn't have a good type tester, I look for a PDF that I can zoom in on.
    Lacking both of those would make my decisions more protracted."
