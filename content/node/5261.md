body: I have to design letterhead and business cards for someone and they have two
  address&#39;s that they want to show on each thing, so it is a bit awkward compared
  to a standard letterhead and card.  <BR> <BR>I was wondering if anyone has had to
  do this before or knew of any examples online that may give me some ideas on how
  I could layout this much information on these pieces. Any advice would be much appretiated.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks!

    could be side by side or stacked vertically. Use a rule, some space or a bolder
    first line two separate the two.
