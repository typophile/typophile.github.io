body: "I have an undergrad degree in Engineering and am still working in Information
  technology. Following my lifelong passion for design, I finally enrolled at Rochester
  Institute of Technology part time as a graphic design undergrad student. I still
  work full time and take foundation level art classes in the evenings. I do plan
  to attend school full time in NYC when my husband is done with school in Rochester(he
  is changing careers into commercial photography).\r\nQuestions - I don't want a
  super academic school, I do not want to end up teaching (I hope not). I have already
  worked in web design firms in a technical capacity and worked on a lot of web sites
  (construction, not design, but good sites none the less). What school is in touch
  with reality? I had heard good things about SVA. Parsons - my impression is that
  it is full of youngsters who think they are the next celebrity designer. I am 32
  years old, married, and a no nonsense person. Things like campus life don't worry
  me in the least, I am only concerned about a quality education. \r\nAlso, Parsons
  has a 2 year degree (AAS) that they say is geared towards career changers, but they
  could not put me in touch with any teachers. Does the AAS count? I am not too keen
  on another 4 year degree but don't think I have what it takes to get into a grad
  program, those sound too advanced frankly. Should I try the associates route, try
  to find a job and then see. Frankly 4 years in school seems risky and a tad out
  of touch with what could be the outcome of that education.\r\nAny help and advice
  would be greatly appreciated. How about MICA and RISD? Are those too academic? Thanks
  again.."

  body: Does it really matter what art school it is? I think that a design from each
    institution tends to have a similar aesthetic. Not always, but most of the time.
    I would go for a school that is more conceptual based rather than anything else.
    I mean anyone can make pretty things.

    close of Dutch Design educations in Holland. They take graphic design very seriously
    over there and have entire institutions dedicated just to type-design! But also
    its ridiculously hard to get in. Something like 6 people per year out of thousands
    of candidates. As for US schools, possibly RSID would be my first choice. '

    I was there (as a youngling), the older students could finish the four-year BFA
    in two to three years, depending. I recommend RISD whole-heartedly. '

    body: The general idea I got about RISD was that the education is aimed towards
      making a good teacher out of you and not get you a job. I frankly dont know
      if RISD is an option due to the location. Any ideas about Parsons vs SVA? I
      gather from the other post that Pratt is probably not worth it.

    be true about the grad program. But you would be looking at the undergrad program,
    I imagine.\r\n\r\nThe only nice things that NYC schools have to offer, in my opinion,
    is proximity to New York designers."

    body: So, it seems the general consensus for undergrad is RISD. When I spoke to
      their dept head, she suggested applying for the grad program as well saying
      that they tack on a year's worth of work for people coming from unrelated disciplines.
      I dont know if I can go to  RI, since my husband plans to work as a commercial
      photographer in NYC. So, no one has anything good to say about SVA? or Parsons?
      Are they just bad?

  body: My ex taught at Parsons and was not that impressed with the student body.
    I've always heard good things about SVA and Pratt (despite the other thread).
    FIT is also an option and, I believe cheaper. You could also apply to NYU's Interactive
    Telecommunications Program if you're interested in the more interactive side of
    design. It's not a graphic design program but more geared towards new technology.

    body: "Thanks for all your responses. On a slightly different note, I found out
      that Mica has a Post-Baccalaureate Certificate Program that prepares students
      from unrelated backgrounds to apply to grad school. Now, I am not sure if this
      is for fine art only, but I am wondering if grad programs in graphic design
      are generally geared towards teachers. Any insights would be appreciated.\r\n"

    this post, and 4 years later, I am 5 months away from graduating with a BFA from
    the School of Visual Arts in NY. I did a 1 semester stint at Pratt institute in
    the graduate Communication Design program and felt it would be tough to catch
    up with people with 4 years on top of me - they supposedly prepare you for graduate
    work with 6 credits worth of additional classes, which I thought would not work
    for me. Anyway, I have been pretty happy with my experience @ SVA and how everything
    worked out in the end.\r\nAmrita\r\namritamarino.com"

  body: "Hmmmm...it looks like you have kind of a sticky situation, yet some really
    great opportunities still.  It's really great that you are considering a 360 degree
    career change into something creative/not always in demand or stable--it's a big
    leap to take for sure.  I understand when you say you want a less academic school
    and one focused more on your field and such since you do already have some type
    of experience.  I mean...yes, 4 years is pretty long to start another whole new
    degree.\r\n\r\nSo, let's a take a look at your options...\r\n1.  http://www.mica.edu/
    - offers the \"create your own degree\" aspect, which will allow you a little
    more freedom with you creativity/art which may or may not fire back in the longrun\r\n2.
    \ http://www.risd.edu/ - it is more renowned with very talented teachers, but
    it is more structured but has really great campus environment and programs\r\n3.
    \ http://www.onlinegraphicdesigndegree.com/ - this might be an alternative to
    you since you are only looking for something short term, you can always just take
    some courses online to add to your already known skills and still keep your IT
    job until you are ready to take on graphic design full time\r\n\r\nHonestly, when
    deciding schools, it's more about the environment and culture that you will feel
    the most comfortable at.  The majority of all art schools are going to give you
    pretty much the education that you need to succeed, so just consider on what YOU
    want to gain from formal education at an art school."
