  I can get it? Also the font under the Heineken logo. (These people are very strict
  about getting it right, but don't give easy access to vector files).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rwc_5653.jpg]

  body: "Never mind the font, it would help if the logo designer knew what a rugby
    ball looked like, or could be bothered to render it with a more complex curve
    than an arc of circle. This looks like the more pointed American football, surely
    a <em>faux pas</em>.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rwc_4444.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ball2_4650.jpg]\r\nBut
    perhaps I am being too harsh and it is also supposed to represent a planetary
    highlight."

  body: I don't think that a logo has to be realistic to be good. I quite like it
    that way.
