body: "I have been recently hired to create the layout for a couple of websites for
  a high profile university research group (don\u2019t ask why, I really don\u2019t
  have much experience in webdesign). The programmer is giving me a hard time because
  the only person he listens to is Mr. Jacob Nielsen. My main concern is to make the
  reading experience as comfortable as possible ON SCREEN so that the user doesn\u2019t
  even dream about printing the page and wasting paper. \r\n\r\nA part from considerations
  about the right typeface etc. do you have any information about column width? For
  big chunks of text, how long should the text column be? I don\u2019t like the idea
  of wide chunks of text as I don\u2019t find particularly comfortable moving my eyes
  (and neck) from left to right all the time when I read. The programmer wants to
  keep the text line very wide because he assumes people will want to print. I\u2019m
  sorry if I\u2019m not explaining it very well but I would be grateful if you could
  point me to interesting links on this issue, or websites that encourage people to
  read on screen rather than print and how to make things more comfortable for the
  reader. \r\n\r\nWe are designing one site with EZ Publish and another one with Moodle,
  anyone has an opinion on these?\r\nI know there are tons of stuff on the web but
  I\u2019m not sure which one is the most reliable and I dislike that J. Nielsen.
  In fact I know there\u2019s been a discussion on him back in 2002 on Typophile but
  it was mainly about Flash. Thank you so much as usual.\r\n\r\n"

    gentle with him, and you might just awaken a sensitivity to what Nielsen is blind
    to. Maybe send him to us. You might encourage him by pointing out that some of
    us (including yours truly) are actually programmers [too].\r\n\r\n> The programmer

    printout... Long line lengths are in fact more damaging in print than onscreen,
    because reading in print has a much better chance of getting more immersive. Try
    explaining that the gap between lines has to be larger the longer the lines, to
    ensure good \"line returns\", and that ends up wasting just as much space. And
    if you're not going to use CSS to increase leading you're sort of naturally channeled
    into a maximum line-length value.\r\n\r\nFont: Georgia.\r\nIf you're ambitious,
    try two columns.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "First of all, the great thing about the web is you can design the page to
    look different on paper than it does on screen. Use a print style sheet for that.\r\n\r\nIf
    the text is inevitably long, just assume folks will print it. The screen is great
    for scanning long texts, not so great for reading long texts.\r\n\r\nYes, line
    length is important. About the only way to control that on screen is to layout
    your columns of text using ems as measurements. That way, if the type increases/decreases
    in size, so will the column, thereby preserving the line lenght. Of course, if
    a person happens to need large time, but still wants a narrow browser, then things
    get hard for them.\r\n\r\nSo...I'd set a width for your column using ems, and
    then set a max-width in pixels (to something like 700 pixels or so) to accomodate
    those that need big type but don't want to deal with horizontal scrolling."

    for me to know its limitations, apparentely it's very flexible and highly customizable
    and...free. \r\nAnd then there's the browser question. I assume horizontal scrolling
    is not a good idea so I kept the 700 pixels as you suggest even if I don't feel
    like using all available width. If it makes sense."

    user selectable screen font styles with adjustable spacing and column widths.

    for your content management tools, the rule of thumb is that all content management

    you really want. Good luck with that as wrangling the CMS code is never fun. ;0)\r\n\r\n"

    font choice. Which is why stats and consistent theories are really important to
    me right now.\r\n\r\nThere's something that's not clear to me: does it mean that

  body: "lore...yes, stats are important, and something that is very much what design
    is about. That said, keep in mind that a lot of web stats are very much red herrings.
    Again, screen resolution is not the key issue. The size of the browser viewport
    is the key stat, and one that is very often not tracked at all. Yes, a lot of
    people will have their browser maximized, but there are a number of exceptions:
    those with side panels open, those with huge monitors that browser with multiple
    windows side-by-side, mac users, and power users who actually take advantage of
    modern multi-windowed OSes by having multiple windows open.\r\n\r\nAs for CMS,
    it depends entirely on the template engine they decide to implement. Most are
    really crappy. Few support true CSS layout and few support basic concepts like
    valid HTML. The best bet is to find a CMS that does not even try to implement
    a template engine allowing you and your developers to make your own templates
    from scratch."

    though the web allows you to accomodate most everyone if you're willing. Granted,
    accomodate and please aren't necessarily the same thing. \r\n\r\nFor instance,
    you could easily (try to) please a majority by assuming that a majority of users
    with the most common screen resolution maximize their browser and optimize your
    layout for that specific situation, but then let your site shrink or expand to
    fit those browsers outside the norm. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
