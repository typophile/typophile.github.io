  body: "\u201CRUGBY WORLD CUP\u201D looks almost like Frutiger, though not quite.\r\n\u201CENGLAND\u201D
    could be Handel Gothic.\r\nThe numbers look custom-made, and not very well at
    that.\r\n[Edit:] Unless it\u2019s available in more weights than the one on MyFonts,
    the numbers are <em>not</em> in Dairyland. They are too thin.\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Dairyland/fonts/]]"

  body: Should be their corporate typeface simply called "RWC" and, according to this
    [[http://www.typophile.com/node/84132#comment-479129|previous discussion]], designed
    by [[http://www.witekite.com/|Witekite]]. It somehow mixes influences from [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/handel+gothic|Handel
    Gothic]] (as suggested by Mans) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/akagi|Akagi]].
