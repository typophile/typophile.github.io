  very very interesting.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/user/xSilverPhinx/28?tabs_selected=member\r\n\r\nits
  called the \"the machine that made us\" all three parts are present in the link,
  my advice is to open them all in different tabs instead of one at a time as u then
  have to look through 24 pages to find part 2 and part 3 all over again.\r\n\r\nthe
  ending is great, they make a 15th century printing press from scratch."

    now, but I would imagine there were legitimate options at the time.\r\n(There
    were many variations of Shakespeare in his day, for instance.)\r\nPrinting may
    be somewhat responsible for standardized spelling of family names.\r\n"

    near Mainz, the city where he did his magic.\r\nThey have a museum there and the
    university is named after him."

  body: While spelling does change a lot, I doubt there would have been much confusion
    between the German -berg and -burg. The words may sound similar, but one implies
    a hill, and the other a fortress/castle/etc. Both are very common in place names.
    Spelling Gutenberg as <em>Gutenburg</em> is incorrect. I doubt that the comparison
    with one of various spellings of Shakespeare is apt.

  body: "According to your logic, it would be, because the implied meanings of the
    different Shakespeare spellings are not the same\u2014 \"pear\" (fruit), and \"pere\"
    (father) in particular being quite different. \r\n\r\nBut does meaning have much
    to do with the spelling of surnames?\r\n\r\nIn those days there was in Britain
    significant variance in spelling, so it's unlikely that people attached any great
    significance to the literal meaning of family names. I would imagine such variance
    occurred in other countries too, as uniformity of spelling is, in theory, a condition
    which can mainly be attributed to the printing press. \r\n\r\nhttp://shakespeareauthorship.com/name1.html"

  body: "Nick, German spelling has for a long time tended to be more regular and phonetically
    reliable than English spelling, in part because it has not inherited the same
    complexity of etymological sources. In German \u2018Gutenberg\u2019 and \u2018Gutenburg\u2019
    are not only spelled differently but pronounced differently. They are different
    names: as different as Goodhill and Goodcastle."

    a piece of metal type \u2013lucky man. On this subject: As we all know documentaries
    on typography and type design are very rare and when they come along they are
    watched avidly. (At least by me) Does anyone remember a programme on BBC about
    20 years ago \u2013 As far as I recall it was a kind of top 20 of typefaces \u2013\r\nit
    featured Freda Sack of The Foundry making pencil drawings \u2013 Not a lot to
    go on but I would love to know if anyone had a copy\r\nas I would love to see
    it again."
