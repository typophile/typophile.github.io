  <BR> <BR>Been looking at the shirts in anticipation of the end of the contest, and
  a coupla things come to mind. These are my thoughts and in no way reflect the opinions
  of the other judges. <BR> <BR>My initial reaction the designs to date is that there
  is a heavy emphasis on clever ideas and concepts but not much attention to detail
  or craft. I will definitely be looking for the latter when I make my choices. Ideas
  are the easy part...execution is 99% of the battle. <BR> <BR>-Rich '

  body: ' Concerning what Rich Roat wrote &#40;!&#41; concerning his well-placed preoccupation
    with craft, in the context of this good-samaritan-style contest allow me to make
    the following suggestion: <BR> <BR>Maybe the submissions should be regarded as
    only nearly-finished, and the winner should be: <BR>1. Judged based on the assumption
    &#40;or rather the hope&#41; that -once chosen- the designer will refine it before
    production. <BR>2. Provided with &#40;entirely voluntary&#41; recommendations
    by the judges as to how to improve the craft &#40;but no recommendations concerning
    the concept&#41;. These recommendations can be taken up by the designer, or not.
    <BR> <BR>I think it should be a balance between concept and craft &#40;not letting
    the latter take absolute precedence&#41; - and I suspect many or all of the judges
    might agree. A shirt with horrible craft shouldn&#39;t be chosen, but one with
    a great concept that just needs polish shouldn&#39;t be discarded as-is, for the
    simple reason that it takes too long to make it user-ready to justify the largely
    intagible gain from the weak possiblity of winning - this thing has turned out
    to be pretty competitive. When you know you&#39;ve won, you&#39;re much more motivated
    to finish it up for real. <BR> <BR>Also, a question: is it possible to revise
    a submission, or should people simply submit a new version alongside? <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' My take on contests is that you submit your best work. If you don&#39;t
    have time to do your best work, don&#39;t submit it. Contests are non-revenue
    projects, so I don&#39;t think they should be regarded as &#34;spec work&#34;.
    And having printed a few t-shirts myself, I&#39;m sure Jared &amp; co. are not
    going to suddenly be the recipients of a financial windfall on the sales of the
    new typophile t-shirt. Anything they do make, they certainly deserve for creating
    this great forum.  <BR> <BR>If some of the folks commenting in this discussion
    are creating entries for this contest, maybe you spend more time creating a good
    design rather than thinking of excuses and rationalizations for a bad one. '

  body: ' On the other hand, it&#39;s probably safe to say that the better a graphic
    designer, the less time he has to design a shirt with no reward and minimal prospects
    of success. My point is that if you make the &#34;polishing&#34; provisional &#40;to
    be applied to the winner only&#41;, and you make that fact clear, you then open
    to door to greater and higher-quality submissions, even if they&#39;re of an &#34;exploratory&#34;
    nature. Look at it this way: the designer is submitting nearly-finished work-in-progress
    to the client. This is important because this client is a mute until the moment
    of truth. <BR> <BR>Free work is to be encouraged. But choosing the judging parameters
    carefully helps improve the eventual results. In fact, the official judging guidelines
    say nothing about highly exacting craftsmanship. Maybe that was an -unwitting-
    good &#34;feature&#34; of this contest? <BR> <BR>Anyway, I don&#39;t mean to whine.
    I think one great side-benefit of this contest is that it serves as a tool to
    learn how to do this better next time. This type of thing is a novelty, with a
    lot of potential, and it can only improve with critical real-world testing. <BR>
