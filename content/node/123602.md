  font that's been stroked. But the curves on the letters are throwing me and the
  identifier software just can't get it from this logo. Kind of a 60's - 70's vibe,
  don't you think? My first time here, please be gentle. Thanks!!"

    yes, the vibe is very 60s or 70s (Hobo saw a resurgence in use at that time),
    but the typeface actually dates from 1910."
