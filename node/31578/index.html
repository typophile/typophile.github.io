  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It is quite clear that one can go quite insane over typefaces&hellip;all these interpretations and re-interpretations&hellip;does it ever end?</p>
<p>So, in the light of all this., her is my own, personal, definitive list of faces. I am screwing my eyes wide shut for responses&hellip;..</p>
<p>Sans serif
Highlander. Legacy Sans. Gill Sans. Bernhard Gothic. Futura. Optima</p>
<p>Serif</p>
<p>Garamond (Augereau). Galliard CC. LTC Goudy Oldstyle. LTC Kennerley.Plantin. Bembo Book (that new version of the abortive early digitization, hopefully consigned to the dustbin or the Museum of Horror Faces), Zapf Renaissance, Baskerville 1757. Walbaum (Storm).</p>
<p>Yes, of course, I love others, but these are the ones I feel I have to have in my library.</p>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>San Serif
You may find this hard to believe - but I could not live without Helvetica. All weights, condensed, extended&hellip; I just couldn&rsquo;t. 
I love Today, Formata and Fruitger. Lately, I&rsquo;ve been impressed what DIN can do. And I tend to you a lot of Classico URW (It has more weights then what the big manufacturers sell for Optima - and you can get 3 to 5 more characters on the line in the same point size.)</p>
<p>Serif
Tough call - there are so many beautiful ones - but my #1 will always be Goudy. I just love that face and it&rsquo;s design. Love the little diamond bullets and punctuation (the real stuff guys - not what Linotype, Adobe. etc. did to it). It&rsquo;s old but always so fresh.
One&rsquo;s I need for the Westerns I do - are Slab Serifs mostly. Lubalin, Memphis but also Claredon and oh my, Cheltenham and Garamond. None of those are my favorites, but I&rsquo;d lose a lot of work if I didn&rsquo;t have them. (Also Eurostile, but that&rsquo;s san serif - and as you can see - I won&rsquo;t mention it as one I can&rsquo;t live without.)</p>
<p>Scripts
I have really come to love the American Script-type that Rob Leuschke has developed. They are beautiful. I wish I could afford them all. I even entered his contest to name the latest one last year&hellip; hoping&hellip; lol. Because of Leuschke - I then became familiar with Sudtipos - and they have some very interesting scripts as well - especially Ministry. For invitation to a wedding - Stuyvesant still holds up. (It was my favorite engraving face when I worked in fine stationery and engraving, too many years ago.) I am not fond of formal scripts, because I tend not to need any in the design work I receive. However, if I were to keep a few around - I&rsquo;d use Edwardian, BIckham and Snells. (Park, Murray Hill, Commercial &ndash; even French - they just don&rsquo;t appeal</p>
<p>Display faces
House Industries - I want the entire library &ndash; LOL &ndash; okay, for this year and probably next. Great fun faces - 
There are many others - but I was always taught to keep an open mind and make sure to &ldquo;marry&rdquo; the type to the artwork. So I wouldn&rsquo;t want to limit myself to a few&hellip;</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me go on &ndash; of course, these are my personal preferences, along with some work ethics &ndash; and&hellip; only my opinion.</p>
<p>Like your wardrobe - it depend on how you feel when you get up, or what the occasion is to dress for - before you decide on your clothes. Same holds true for type.</p>

No, I am a writer and a psychotherapist, based in Banbury UK. I was a barrister before that. My father, incidentally was a practising architect over here, now retired. When working for the LCC (London County Council) as it was then called, he designed the lettering for our Chelsea Bridge (the one over the Thames).</p>
<p>Anyway, is my selection of faces so antique? i don&rsquo;t know. I prefer to think of them as, well, classics. What are your own favourites?? Perhaps I really am out of touch?</p>

<p>Not at all, they&rsquo;d be appropriate tools for a wide range of projects, including writing and psychotherapy. If you&rsquo;d replied that you designed rave flyers or video game interfaces then I would have been surprised by the tools you&rsquo;d chosen.</p>
