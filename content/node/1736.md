body: Well, look at this... Now it&#39;s my turn to ask for help. The name of this
  face is stuck in the back of my cranium somewhere and I can&#39;t seem to pry it
  out. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s an old Letraset or Mecanorma face, but unfortunately
  I don&#39;t have my catalogues in front of me for reference. I know I&#39;m going
  to kick myself for not knowing this one off the top of my head. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18954.gif"

  body: Mark, you&#39;re a peach. <BR> <BR>I though that it may have been one of Othmar&#39;s
    children. I had Tektura, Femina and Sparta checked off but couldn&#39;t remember
    any other names. And I managed to find it in my Letraset catalogue right before
    checking the board again. Thanks.
