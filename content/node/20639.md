    no clues to any of the two?"

  body: I'm really sorry -- I did some research but couldn't find anything. Your topic
    has had over 140 reads, so I guess other people are stumped as well.

    which was designed by Value and Service \r\n(www.valueandservice.co.uk). I know
    that Value and Service \r\nvery rarely design there own fonts (although they did
    add \r\nligatures to Helvetica). I'll be working a floor above them in a \r\nmonth
    or so, so I could always ask for you :P, or you could \r\ndrop them an email\r\n\r\nThe
    second one I'm not sure. Looks a like Akkurat \r\n(www.lineto.com) in the light
    weight, except most obviously, \r\nAkkurat has a double storey 'g' and this does
    not. But if you \r\nlook at that 'g' it looks really quite badly drawn, so perhaps
    it \r\nis Akkurat Light but with a custom 'g'. The uppercase looks \r\nvery similar.
    \r\n\r\nPhil"

  body: Thanks... still don't know the first one I'll ask the authors... the second
    one is "Mercury" from Radim Pesko (he also did the Boijmans museum type with mevis
    and van deursen) it might still be a work in progress I think...

    German font.
