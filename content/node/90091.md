  for my text, I should probably find and font that pairs with crimson for my logo.\r\n\r\nThe
  brand is very important, timeless classic, modern sophisticated elegance to appeal
  to the 25-35 year old affluent female.\r\n\r\nThis blog has 30k words on it and
  needs to be ledgibeo. :)\r\n\r\nHere is a text page. http://www.josephvincentphotography.com/photographic-style/\r\n\r\nI

  body: No, but it does need to load up in font squirrel. This blog UI only uses FS
    font kits. I can generate font kits as long as they are not blacklisted. The logo
    doesn't have to load in FS but the blog fonts would.

  body: "Dude, you shouldn\u2019t run random stuff through FontSquirrel like that.
    Have you seen the checkbox with the big red bold text next to it in the bottom
    there? Besides, autohinting is crap. Bloated file size and lousy rendering.\r\n\r\n<em>font
    design help</em>\r\nIt\u2019s not too clear from your post what exactly it is
    you are looking for. Do you want help designing a font? Are you looking for a
    font that is suitable for online use to go with your logo? Maybe [[http://www.webtype.com/font/poynterserifre-family/|Poynter
    Serif RE]] (which can be self-hosted). In any case, quality isn\u2019t free.\r\n\r\n<em>ledgibeo</em>\r\n?"

  body: "<cite>This blog UI only uses FS font kits.</cite>\r\n\r\nAre you sure? Maybe
    you should contact the creators of this blog UI and complain about such an arbitrary
    restriction.\r\n\r\n<cite>I can generate font kits as long as they are not blacklisted.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    haven't checked, maybe Crimson's EULA allows this kind of use, maybe not.\r\n\r\nSince
    your comment reflects a common misunderstanding:\r\nThe fact that fonts are not
    blacklisted and that FS does not refuse to convert them does <em>not necessarily
    imply</em> that you are allowed to convert them. It only means that these fonts
    are ... not blacklisted (yet).\r\nAs Frode said, see FS's big red bold text and
    check the fonts' EULA. That is what matters, rather than whether fonts happen
    to be blacklisted or not."

  body: I have a strong tendency to advocate for PT Serif for web text. It's under
    an OFL-like licence, and I think FontSquirrelgirl has it. Might want to look at
    Vollkorn as well.

  body: I tried PT Serif and it seems to work well except the cut off J. As my name
    start with J, it could be a problem. Vollkorn in caps won't work.

  body: "True, not everyone'll like the short J. Same with the detached Q. It would,
    however, matter less in body text, which I intended to suggest. PT Sans might
    work, too, if you prefer a sans-serif there. Both have a caption style for the
    small text&hellip; and, boy, does it make a difference!\r\n\r\nCrimson in the
    logo looks pretty respectable to me. Sure, I'm not an expert, no matter how one
    stretches, twists or bends that term."
