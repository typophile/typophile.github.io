  body: "Hi chris, hrant, akira, typohile members,\r\nMy sincere apology guys...ignorance
    is no defense, and i did not mean to offend. It won't happen again. I do not have
    the typeface, installed on my machine, that is...i just saw it on my friend's
    machine, he gave me the name, FF Confidential, and I googled it because he didn't
    remember where he got it. I posted the first link I found, for illustration purposes
    only. I dont even want this particular font...I just want to know what typeface
    it is derived from and maybe a link to where I can purchase it. If anyone can
    help, please do.\r\nCheers"
