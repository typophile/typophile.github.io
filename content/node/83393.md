  body: I'm really fond of using a sans-serif font for headlines then a serif font
    for the body text, or the other way around. I think you need to find a strong
    serif typeface with a large family for body text. Although, then again, it definitely
    depends on what you're using this for. If it's for the internet, you could just
    use Bree itself, I think that would look classy. But if it's for a print media,
    I really think you should find a strong serif typeface. I dunno, maybe it's just
    me.

  body: "Try a sober serif face but with an \"e\" that has a curve at its nose; since
    \"e\" is the\r\nmost common letter that would go a long way towards creating harmony
    with Bree.\r\nA secondary letter to consider is the \"f\", which of course points
    towards Fedra.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi\r\n\r\nthanks for the suggestions. Although I am still confused if Bree
    as body would work well for a 200 page document?\r\n\r\nFedra seems interesting,
    will try that. Can I get an alternative for Karmina? and also what about Excelsior?
    I liked the contrast but is it too wide to set well with bree??\r\n\r\nI looked
    at apex and Dax too. I liked Dax as its tall and condensed feel which goes well
    with bree. But not satisfied yet.\r\nLooking forward for more suggestions\r\n\r\n:)\r\nVD"

  body: "Something that should have been asked at the very beginning:\r\nWhat is it
    about?\r\n\r\nNothing like Bree for a long document, please! In fact the only
    sans I\r\nwould personally recommend for long text is Legato (which however\r\nprobably
    does not harmonize with Bree).\r\n\r\nKarmina: Note the very large x-height -
    suitable for ~9 point. Is that\r\na size that works here? Unless you're trying
    to economize space, for a\r\nlong document it seems too harsh in terms of readability.\r\n\r\nExcelsior:
    Are you looking for an old newspaper look? Otherwise I'd\r\nstay away from that
    class of type. Also, there's the same issue with the\r\nlarge x-height.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I'm not sure you need something narrow - and certainly that\r\ncan't be the only
    thing holding the two fonts together. But you might\r\nstill look at the work
    of Sumner Stone, who seems to have a penchant\r\nfor narrow type.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi Hrant,\r\n\r\nWell i wanted to use bree just for the headings, and for
    body something that just blends in and of course is legible. I feel that for a
    document ( Which has something to do with DESIGN RESEARCH), bree definitely is
    a no go for text. Thats why the question. But as the text is large, I would choose
    serif. \r\n\r\nCombining Excelsior was just an exercise to find interesting contrasts.
    I agree its very old newspaper like and I was just looking for options and opinions.\r\n\r\nBy
    the discussions so far I feel a serif would be the way... karmina seems suitable,
    but somewhere I feel the need to explore more before I carry on.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nVD"

  body: "Design research? Then I might look for something less organic than Karmina.
    Something a bit sharp and formal, but with Bree's roundness and slight unorthodoxy...
    Maybe a wedge-serif... Hmmm, this really wasn't my intention, but... Patria?  :-)
