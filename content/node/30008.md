body: 'During Dadaism, what kind of typography was used? I know for a fact that because
  of the war, everyone was very much against it and started desining outrageous things
  so does that mean that san serif came to be when designers took off the serifs of
  Roman influenced lettering? Is that the cause of it and is that how Bauhaus took
  san serif a step further? where does slab serif come into all this though? And during
  the 20th century, we see a variety of movements fron Art Deco to Art Noveau to the
  hippy 70''s style type. Is this because society''s attitudes changed towards lifestyles
  etc that everything stated having ''styles-movements'' to them? Is it because people
  wanted to see new innovative things that made designers experiment more with type?
  what is your theory? '

  body: Marcel Duchamp said "The only thing worse than a serif typeface is a sans-serif
    typeface," and invented Dingbats as a reaction to what he called "the tyranny
    of the alphabet." Other Dadaists, perhaps misinterpreting his comment, strived
    to create faces that were neither serif nor sans-serif, and among the styles to
    arise from these efforts were slabs and flares. This is recounted on p216 of <em>I
    Did Seek The Serif</em> by Egbert Gebbinforte, Harper-Mifflin Books, 1998.

  body: It's "sans serif" or "sans-serif" not "san serif". If you're going to study/obsess
    over type you should at least get your terminology straight.

    dangerous to make sweeping statements like everyone was against the war so they

    of the world were indifferent, if they weren't vehemently opposed, to Dada typography.\r\nTim"

  body: "Sans-serif type got respect after Dada, not from it. Dada (along with other
    things) made rule-breaking much more acceptable (at least in the art world), and
    probably inspired some of the appearance of sans type in areas other than the
    commercial jobs where it was seen before. But what really brought out sans type
    was the work done at the Meisterschule and the Bauhaus, which became an international
    phenomenon after the publication of Tschichold's <em>The New Typography</em>.
    \r\n\r\nStyle movements are related to the attitudes and needs of a society, and
    as we understand them they are constructs of historians who create  terminology
    that eases discussion. It's important to keep that in mind because there are a
    lot of styles that get lumped together (ie. arts and crafts, art nouveau, and
    jungendstil) and in-between periods that get lost in the cracks.  Going much deeper
    than that is the sort of thing that could fill up an entire graduate education. "

    too codifying for a process that attempted to take the rug out of the rug that
    someone is standing on. \r\n\r\nSo to ask what typefaces the Dada people used
    is absolutely absurd (but not absurd like the dada way, whatever that may be)."
