  expensive selection. If you would have recommendations? Weights I need are medium
  and black, as well as respective obliques.\r\nArgo looks like this: http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Images/Argo%20Black%201.GIF\r\n\r\nI
  would like to use a font that has \"normal\" or inexpensive price. I did find a
  free one from www.dafont.com called Communist (that is inexpensive indeed: http://www.dafont.com/communist.font
  ), but it's obliques are not suitable and some are even missing, also some problems
  with characters."

    also by Gerard Unger is also expensive, but 20% cheaper than the DTL font and
    has some of the same feel. '
