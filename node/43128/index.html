<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello,
This is my first time on this forum and I am new to this page. I was recently assigned a research project for typography on a type designer. The designer that I received is [[John Downer]]. I am have some trouble finding the resources and information I need. The largest issue that I am having is finding information that is considered an article. I am only allowed 2 internet sources the rest have to be from articles and books and I need 6 sources total. I was looking to see if some one could point me in the right direction of where to look. I would appreciate the help.
Thank You. </div>

<div class=commentbody>There’s a passage in the Sign Painter section of the House Industries book about John Downer coming out and teaching them some stuff, try playing that one up. Also, have you tried searching <em>The Design and Applied Arts Index</em> for articles? I find that it’s often the only useful database for tracking down good stories about designers, especially type designers. If your school library doesn’t have access to that database, get the librarian to direct to a library that does. Because you’re in New York you have access to some great libraries, so get out there and ask the librarians to help you look stuff up. You should see if the <a href=http://tdc.org/>TDC</a> library has some stuff!
If you still have trouble, try printing all the good internet articles you can find by or about John and showing them to your professor, and pointing out that in a field as esoteric as type design, sometimes the internet is a better resource than a library. Also, check online articles carefully, sometimes they are reprints of articles that appeared in obscure magazines that aren’t in libraries, so you can just cite the original magazine.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I suggest also looking for articles about specific typefaces (Bitstream Iowan Old Style, Vendetta etc), as well as articles <strong>by</strong> John Downer. Emigre magazine must have a few of his articles. </div>

This article says a lot about John's character. I can hear his voice as I read it. He doesn't beat around the bush in the article and he doesn't do so in life either. (At least not from what I've learned in talking with him over the years.)

<div class=commentbody>In addition to the Emigre articles that Tiffany cites, John wrote a short article for the introduction of his Vendetta type in Emigre No. 50, Spring 1999. I don't know if it's also online.</div>
