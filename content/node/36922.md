  anyone know of a good way to order a copy other than eBay and Amazon?

  body: 'Anything after version 5 will have around 1,000 mostly-Bitstream fonts in
    TrueType and PS1 formats. If all you <em>really</em> want is the fonts, look for
    version 6: the Draw program was a total disaster (prone to crash when you went
    to save a file, making it a big waste of time), so it ought to be dirt cheap.
    If you also want to use the program, either version 9 or 10 is a good bet, both
    in terms of reliability and cost. And I doubt you''ll beat an eBay price (if you''re
    patient) anywhere: right now, there are upgrade versions (you don''t need a serial
    number to access the font folders on the CDs) going for less than $20.00.'
