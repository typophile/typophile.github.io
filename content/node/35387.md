body: I am curious if there are certain characters that users of fonts don't like
  in specific fonts (i. e. if they think that they don't match the rest quite well).
  E. g. I can't help myself - I somehow don't like ampersands in Corporate A family.
  I am also disappointed with @ character in many fonts - sometimes it seems there
  was put no effort in designing them...
