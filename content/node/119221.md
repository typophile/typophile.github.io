  body: "Curiously, I found two matches (Soleto and Prometo), both from Dalton-Maag,
    and both with no Cyrillic.\r\nAlso similiar, and also without Cyrillic: Monotype's
    Burlingame."

  body: "Some versions of Helvetica include a Cyrillic alphabet which can also be
    adapted to make the logo. But I did not spot any with Cyrillic letters that were
    heavier than bold.\r\nDon"

  body: "Edited:\r\nI believe I have solved your question.\r\nIn my opinion this image
    is a customized logo based on a heavy weight of a Cyrillic font called Helios,
    or an artificially thickened version of it. Here\r\nFrom the \u0414\u0423\u0411\u041B\u0415\u0420\u0423.\u041D\u0415\u0422
    website I downloaded http://www.dubleru.net/download/nash_zapad.pdf  which contains
    a subset of  Helios-C Bold. As you can see the letterforms match your image\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HeliosCBoldInUseSM_6606.jpg]\r\nHelios
    is sold by Paratype http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Helios.htm  It includes
    a black weight, which seems to match the weight of the logo. Helios is a Cyrillic
    adaptation of Helvetica.\r\nDon"

  body: "Edited in view of my discovery of the matching base font, to cut references
    to other fonts.\r\nNo change to the first part of post:\r\nDalton-Maag's Soleto,
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/daltonmaag/soleto/ already suggested by Riccardo,
    \ has the right weight and is pretty close for _E_, _P_, _H_ and _T_ in Soleto
    Black and some of the other glyphs could be used to help make _\u0414_, _\u0423_,
    _\u0411_ and _\u041B_ [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SoletoBlackInUseSM_4235.jpg]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/daltonmaag/soleto/\r\nAnother option is to edit a
    font like ... cut the rest as redundant, see later post.\r\nDon"
