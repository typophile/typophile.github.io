  a weird urge to move the parentheses so they hang outside the block of text, or
  shift them up a bit so they hug the letters more tidily.\r\n\r\nIs this a completely
  rubbish idea?\r\n\r\nAny advice appreciated. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_5873.jpg]"

  body: Because parentheses are designed to work with upper- and lowercase letters,
    they should be shifted up anyway when used with all caps. But I don't think they
    warrant hanging in the margin. That is reserved for punctuation that is smaller,
    doesn't fill the character space, like periods, quotes, and dashes.

  body: InDesign's Story feature will half hang them. Might help the look without
    calling attention.
