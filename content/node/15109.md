  down my pesonal logo to two options. I'd really appreciate it if I could get your
  opinions on em!\r\n\r\nFYI: I'm a graphic design student, graduating this semester.
  This ID will be on my business cards and resume until I'm gainfully employed - and
  those items will be designed around whatever logo I go with. Keep in mind these
  are preliminary computer comps and the colors are (somewhat) arbitrary at this point.\r\n\r\nMy
  own personal thoughts, : I like the top one a lot but fear it may not seem very
  exciting; and I also worry if everyone will read it correctly.  The second one I
  like; but, fear it may be too whimsicle and gimmicky. \r\n\r\nShare your thoughts
  \u2013 good, bad, or ugly.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I see the second as a warning sign, spectacles ahead, kissing snakes, (mainly
    because of the yellow diamond, I think), while the first has potential, it needs
    some work to it. Trying a B with uneven bowls might work and trying to get the
    shapes at top and bottom of the B to relate as serifs to the C or try a ball terminal
    on the C, the counter also needs work. I think it does read fairly instantly and
    it is a mark that is going to appear with your name, as to whether it is exciting,
    does it need to be? More important that it is well created and shows a good appreciation
    of letterforms, after all you are not going to need to use it for long, hopefully.\r\nGood
    luck on the job seeking.\r\nTim"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback Tim. The second one was intended to look like a road
    sign. That's cool that you saw so many other things in it.\r\n\r\nI could play
    around with the first one a bit, based on your suggestions, just one question:
    what do you mean by \"the counter needs work\"? Since, in the logo the entire
    letter \"C\" is the counter...\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: Chad, are you seeing the original JPG as being a black box? That is what I
    am getting, and have run into this in a couple of other threads. Seem to be some
    strange bug, we are looking into it. I imagine you also didn't name the file "drupal?"

    exported the jpg from Illustrator - if that has anything to do with it\u2026 that
    particular feature never seems to work right."

  body: "just a word of advice...i'm always very dismissive of resume's, letterhead
    and business cards that bear the mark of the person. 95% of other designers i
    work/worked with feel the same way. why? i think it's usually because they are
    bad and due to the fact they are poorly designed and not well thought out, it
    shows even more the designer is unfamiliar with symbols, shapes and letterforms.
    these are usually two letters of someone's name combined in some juxtaposed way
    creating one unified shape. i'd much much much rather see time and effort put
    into organizing information well on a page such as your letterhead and/or business
    card than a symbol that is usually non-representative of you as a person or you
    as a designer. \r\n\r\nto sum up your design skills, your talent, your past 2
    or 4 years and your personality into one mark is a tough job. coming from someone
    who sees portfolios and resumes on a semi-frequent basis, stick to your design
    of your collateral. leave the identity branding to the corporations and let your
    design skills represent you.\r\n\r\nmy 2 cents...if you really want some feedback
    on what youve posted, let me know via email or a post here and i'll help out where
    i can. i would just recommend staying away from this route\r\n\r\nw|m"

      your name in a nice clean face, and lay everything else out expertly. even if

    Since, in the logo the entire letter \u201CC\u201D is the counter\u2026\r\n\r\nYes,
    that could have done with more explanation I mean the open counter of the C especially
    on the left looks cramped, either extending it left beyond the B or taking the
    right hand of the C further right into the B might be a solution.\r\n\r\nWill
    makes a good point about the quality having to be tip top and the layout will
    have to reflect that otherwise the reader will get a bad first impression.\r\n\r\nTim"

    the C. It may be perfect but take a look at making it smaller.

    on the upper versions, at the moment the C seems better drawn than the B which
    reduces the overall effectiveness of the logo.\r\nTim"
