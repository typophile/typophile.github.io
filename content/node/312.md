body: I am in the process of purchasing a number of type licences for a London University.
  The idea is to limit the number of typefaces available for design students enabling
  them to be familiar with around 20 families. <BR>Rather than pick them myself I
  would like to have a broad input into the final pickings. <BR>Please could you post
  typefaces that you personally feel are indispensable to the modern designer.Ideally
  you could list your top 20. i will be posting a chart of deigners top 20 typerfaces
  on <a href="http://www.fatears.co.uk" target="_blank">www.fatears.co.uk</a>  in
  the near future. Andy wall <BR>

  body: Andrew, this is really an interesting premise. Is the limit 20  <BR>because
    of budget? I think if you hand-picked 100 typefaces <BR>you&#39;d have a great
    start. <BR> <BR>In my school we had the entire Bitstream library and some  <BR>basics
    form Adobe. The result was first-year students all <BR>crowding around the bitstream
    poster looking for a cool,  <BR>different font and ending up with Copperplate
    &#40;gasp!&#41; or  <BR>Bank Gothic &#40;egads!&#41; or worse; Mistral, Hobo,
    Handel or  <BR>Balloon gothics &#40;pow! biff! splat! oof!&#41;. <BR> <BR>In those
    early years, design students are so caught up  <BR>trying to find what&#39;s cool,
    that they don&#39;t learn what works.  <BR>&#40;I know there are always exceptions...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>My school has since purchased the entire HTF library,  <BR>kudos to them.

  body: 'You know, I&#39;m not sure I can think of 20 typefaces that I would recommend
    as a beginning library. Once you get beyond a small number of solid text faces
    and a couple of good titling and sans serif designs, you quickly get into that
    area in which the right typeface to have is the right typeface for a particular
    project. Take script faces, for example: I can suggest a number of good ones,
    <i>i.e.</i> types that are well designed and executed, in a variety of different
    styles, but I don&#39;t think any of them necessarily belong in a beginner library
    because each tends to be particularly suited to such a narrow range of work. <BR>
    <BR>On the seriffed text typeface front, I would suggest selecting one example
    from each of the major historical styles: one Venetian, one French renaissance,
    one Dutch oldstyle, one neo-classical, one romantic, etc. I would try to avoid
    the more obvious choices, <i>e.g.</i> Mardersteig&#39;s Dante instead of Bembo,
    Monotype Bullmer instead of Baskerville.'

  body: i think 20 type faces is perfect. this is what i tell my class to begin with.
    the idea that you need hundreds of typefaces is ridiculous. when i was in school
    i had thousands upon thousands of bad typefaces. i hoarded anything i could get.
    this only helped confuse me when it came to choosing an appropriate face. it was
    a breath of fresh air to just delete them all off my hard drive. i only use about
    10 or so at any moment in my career. type can be tricky and hard to deal with.
    it is best to have fewer faces and understand the ins and outs of each one. this
    is the only way one can expect to master a typeface and type in general. <BR>
    <BR>i think it is also important to avoid display faces. these can be made individual
    depending on the project and current aesthetic. i make all of my own display faces
    or i am at least very picky about a display face made by someone else. no matter
    how trendy and cool the display face is you will look back in 10 years and think
    to your self &#34;what the hell was i thinking&#34; <BR> <BR>anyway here is the
    list of classics i use. <BR> <BR>akzidenz grotesk bq <BR>helvetica neue  <BR>avenir
    &#40;or futura, both are geometric sans, i prefer avenir&#41; <BR>frutiger <BR>trade
    gothic <BR>franklin gothic <BR>optima <BR>bodoni &#40;or didot but not filosofia&#41;

    work in all of the typefaces you select. It is an excellent way to have them compare
    and contract the strengths of each face.  <BR> <BR>Becuase of that I would make
    my list from historic sources. Students would see the evolution of type, and see
    how that evolution happened as they used the faces. <BR> <BR>Without putting a

    this font rocks. Again, wish I had the money right now. Great stuff.&#41; <BR>

    work with that single font -- amazing&#41;.  <BR> <BR>15 &#62; Bauer Bodoni <BR>&#40;Must-have-classicism
    for your students. And great to play with in Display-size&#41; <BR> <BR>16 &#62;
    Franklin Gothic or Bureau Grotesque <BR>The strong and strudy workhorses. Also,
    you can use Franklin to let your students do a bit Brodyism. <BR> <BR>17 &#62;
    Bell Gothic or Interstate <BR>Looking modern yet not too modern. Nice for Corporate
    stuff, although lacking in some departments &#40;Caps, Ligaturs, OSFs&#41;. Both
    nice because of their not-too-cold-coldness. Used ALL-CAPS-Bell for a CD just

    <BR>19 &#62; Thesis Serif or Thesis Mono  <BR>The serif is just beautiful for
    short texts, the Mono has a more lively approach to the coldness of OCR and Letter
    Gothic. <BR> <BR>20 &#62; Zapfino CD <BR>wonderful Toy. Next best thing to being

    Though I think it&#39;s also a typography instructor&#39;s duty to teach their

  body: I think everyones comments are very helpful. i think the one point I have
    to clarify is that we are talking about 20 typefaces that a designer should know
    as part of their job. Many graduate designers have not yet came to grips with
    more than, say,5 typefaces. The idea here is to push students into using a limited
    number of type designs, during certain projects, and see how their typographic
    awareness increases along with their knowledge of the &#39;20 typefaces&#39;.
    Ive already included comic sans, minstrel and brush script so there is no need
    to include them in future post! ;&#41; On leaving university they should be able
    to identify each of the designs, and be able to adjust their use according to
    the project. Its OK to have a favourite type design, but worrying when they try
    to use it for the wrong job!

    Best and worse typefaces as submitted by various typographers. Somewhere in the

    But I recall there is a photo of someone wearing the tee-shirt. Though I don&#39;t
    know that it was the ITC version of Garamond.

    and its a hilarious inside joke. Just love it. I want one of those tee-shirts!
    I would happily use ITC Garamond instead of Helvetica any day :-&#41; It&#39;s
    so 80s! &#40;I hate Helvetica, by the way ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I know I lot of typographers/type
    designers can&#39;t stand ITC Garamond. Apart from the enormous x-height, the
    rounded treatment on absolutely everything is a bit much. I don&#39;t mind it
    as a display face for certain things. I wonder what you guys think of it? And
    why do you think Apple dropped their Apple Garamond Narrow &#40;they redrew from
    the ITC condensed version which I think was a much more plausible type&#41;? I
    think it was a stupid decision because it was such a strong element in their corporate
    identity. They were desperate to be more &#39;modern&#39; I guess. But Myriad?!
    That&#39;s someone else&#39;s corporate type!

    one can disdain ITC Garamond. Some poeple only mind that it was called a Garamond,
    since its spirit is so distorted from the original. But that&#39;s too forgiving.
    You would want to go deeper and hate what it does to French culture: according
    to some people &#40;like Mandel&#41;, a small x-height is a <i>requirement</i>
    of being a French font, and Garamond is the Frenchest of them all. And you might
    go deeper, into functionality, and hate the fact that it combines such gaudy proportions
    with features only fitting in a serious text face. <BR> <BR>On the other hand,
    in terms of corporate indentity, I agree that shifting to Myriad was a horrible

    are better than 50% he&#39;ll get a Jannon - and of course not even realize what

  body: Yes, Jean. It&#39;s not a Garamond at all. As a student, I was quite confused
    by the different versions of the supposedly &#39;Garamond&#39;. At one point I
    was naive enough to think that ITC&#39;s version was THE Garamond! How silly was
    I? Yes, it does look more like a redrawing of Monotype&#39;s version. And now
    my favourite &#39;Garamond&#39; is your Sabon Next! <BR> <BR>Hrant, nice reference
    from MyFont. I always wondered about the Apple Garamond. You know what? I still
    have the TrueType Apple Garamond Narrow on my computer. It was bundled with my
    old Color StyleWriter printer. Bitstream did a nice job, I think. Much nicer than
    the original ITC. Quite a few other fonts were bundled with that printer, including
    Lucida Bright, Lubalin Graph, etc.

    I was beginning to think you only liked helvetica!  <BR>Sabon is one I have used
    before and will probably use more. I love akzi but it has some things I don&#39;t
    understand... Why do the em dashes come out almost identical to the ens? With
    the lining numerals though it makes me not care so much about the short ems. The
    font overall is ever-so-slightly condensed but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the
    reason for the dashes being short. Another oddity is that the quotes don&#39;t
    seem to match very well but their plain-ness is kind of growing on me. <BR>Shelley&#39;s
    probably my favorite script, unless you just want them to learn how to drown themselves
    in an expert set such as poetica. Lastly, is stone sans too quirky to make anyone&#39;s
    list? Either avenir, stone or univers should make the list, if anything, just
    because of their ranges &#40;thin ultra condensed!? cool but useless?&#41; <BR>
