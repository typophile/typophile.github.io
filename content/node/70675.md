  Optima, but not exactly.  It appeared on a mid-1970s book cover (Robert Adams, The
  New West) and a mid-1980s book cover (Jennifer Bartlett, Rhapsody).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aperture-adams-the-new-west-1_4062.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "1970's is pre-digital (and I agree it's not Optima), so I have been trying
    to look in Photo-Lettering catalogs and books showing film types. So far I have
    not found a good match. This is one that Mark Simonson might know, since he has
    some more of the older books.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    from Red Rooster is similar but a bit condensed. If you graphically flattened/widened
    Radiant you might be close. It even has an alternate R that looks like the album
    typeface.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    was done. It's the only weight I've ever seen, anyway. Don't know if there is
    a digital version.\r\n\r\nHere's what the whole font looks like:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stettler_5374.jpg]"

  body: Now that I look at this again, I think the type on the second book is some
    other typeface. The first one's definitely Stettler, though.

    is the best sample I have of that, which unfortunately doesn't show the whole
    font:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bakersans_4965.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
    more or less a thick and thin version of Helvetica. There were other weights,
    too."

  body: "More Baker Sans stuff... There were three styles: Fineline, Display and Monoline.
    Notice that the Monoline is practically identical to Helvetica. The other two
    differ in the amount of stroke contrast. It's an interesting concept, but I've
    rarely seen any of them in use. Not too common in type specimen catalogs, either.
    At least the ones I have. I think the designer may have been Ray Baker. Probably
    not Arthur Baker, but I really don't know. I don't think any of them have been
    digitized.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bakersans002_3466.jpg]"

    Arthur Baker, with an introduction from Frank Romano on the copy I have. It's
    a great precursor of Noordzij's ideas, there's a matrix of 12 variations: \"His
    eye sees a fineline and a mono as poles apart;...\""

    Any idea when it was released?

    ran across them. But didn't find what looked like a complete set."
