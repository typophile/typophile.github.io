  There's something in the air\"\r\n\r\nWhatThe Font has suggested some close matches
  \u2013 Mundo Sans-Extra Light, Truth FB Thin \u2013\_but no exact matches. I can't
  find the s or g in any of my fonts.\r\nCould this be a new company typeface for
  Apple after Myriad and Apple Garamond before that?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\np.s.
  I tried to insert an image but Safari (3.0.4) crashed three times as I was attempting
  to preview my post. I'm running 10.4.11. Is this a known issue?"

    rip-off).

    corporate typeface they would do it on their products and in their advertising
    first, but certainly not on a single fair banner."
