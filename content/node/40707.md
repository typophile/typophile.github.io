  know if I may be off the mark or maybe I have to look again but I'm in the middle
  of font production with Illustrator and switched to Fontlab Studio 5.04 after using
  Illustrator to draw and Fontographer to do everything else...not to go into too
  much detail but where is the mythical \"Do Not Rescale EPS\" feature that is supposed
  to be under the Preferences section on the Macintosh version of Fontlab 5.04...or
  does it go by another name now?\r\n\r\nSecond question...does anyone know about
  any good (existing) type foundries in Atlanta?\r\n\r\nCan't wait to hear the answers,\r\nSas"
