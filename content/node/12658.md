  this forum like an addict.\r\n\r\nSecond. \r\n\r\nA friend of mine is in the trouble
  of choosing a new font as well as developing all the new road signals etc (se\xF1alectica
  in spanish) for our home state, she requested my help in choosing the right font,
  first I thought researching on legibility issues etc. Looking for Info on what has
  been done here in terms of typographic choosing.\r\n\r\nHere is the problem.\r\n\r\nWhich
  way to go in terms of research\r\nThis proposal has to be run fast in order to keep
  the client\r\nWhat do you masters of typography think would be the best font choosing
  (suggestions, fonts, criteria, foundrys). \r\nHow much would it cost licensing an
  existing font for this matter?\r\n\r\nThanx in advance. And Im glad I have done
  my first post.\r\n\r\nSorry for my english. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Your friend is in trouble.  ;D \r\n\r\nIt sounds like there is no time to
    make a custom typeface. Choose a typeface with several weights, clear numerals,
    nice open spacing, with letters clear and different from each other. Maybe your
    state is not too conservative? Your friend may have success proposing another
    style of typeface. Typefaces I suggest comparing:\r\n\r\nChianti from Bitstream\r\nCronos
    Sans - (smallest size masters) from Adobe\r\nStainless from FontBureau\r\nFelbridge
    or Zemestro from fonts.com\r\nAroma from FontShop\r\n\r\nAsk the type foundry
    about the price of licensing a typeface to a state government office. \r\n\r\nTo
    save time, your friend can learn a lot by reading about the development of Clearview,
    which was done for highway signage in the US. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.clearviewhwy.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/HTM/clearfont/\r\n\r\nThis
    is enough to give your friend a lot of useful information.\r\n\r\nI doubt your
    friend will need to supply such a large number of weights and widths. \r\n\r\nMost
    important: \r\n\r\nMuch more letterspacing than for print\r\nClear, open letterforms
    (like Frutiger, not like Helvetica)\r\nLarge x-height (but not like Avant Garde)\r\nStrong,
    even strokes and terminals (like Frutiger, not like Optima)\r\n\r\nYour English
    is very good. Good luck to your friend, and please report back how the project
    turned out!\r\n\r\nCarl"

    body: "Tnx for the comment, I was thinking to suggest frutiger NEXT as the typeface
      since it has been actually used for signage before. State It\xB4s not that conservative
      at least now theres this cultural thing going on throughout. Really thank you.
      '\r\n\r\nI'll let you all know how the project goes. A custom font should be
      the answer however I understand theres no time for this. "

  body: Crossgrove gave some great links. Another typeface suggestion, you might consider,
    is <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/Parisine">Parisine</a>
    from Porchez Typofonderie. Originally designed for the wayfinding system of the
    Paris Metro. An added bonus to this would be also licensing <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/ParisinePlus">Parisine
    Plus</a> which has more flourish and could be used to add a softer alternative
    for certain settings. Also, you can read the history of this lovely and useful
    typeface <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/gazette/articles/parisine">here</a>.

  body: Gill Sans. It is very legible from a distance and it is omnipresent. A simple
    font like Franklin Gothic heavy might also work.

  body: "Makote,\r\n\r\nFaced with the same dilemma, I'd look to the masters (and
    all of them are still living). \r\n\r\nI would strongly suggest you look up the
    works of master of systems typographer [[Erik Spiekermann]]. He's overseen the
    type systems for Berlin's street signs, the public transportation signage and
    system for Berlin light rail and underground metro, the identity and type for
    Berlin's postal service. His latest project (still underway?) is for the German
    (Berlin?) railway. (Good thing I'm not a professional journalist, because I don't
    have to check my sources. I'm sure someone could correct some of these facts,
    but the net result  is the same.)\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming feeling I got in Berlin
    was that I'd been transported to Spiekertown. His commercially available fonts
    (for signage and wayfinding) include FF Transit, FF Info, FF Meta--<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fonts&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=76&searchby=designer&searchID=824&searchletter=A&fontRendererText=Yo+quiero+Typophile%21\">view
    all the Spiekerfonts here</a>.\r\n\r\nCarl already recommended <a href=\"http://www.terminaldesign.com/retail_specimen.php?ID=1001&viewFam=1\">ClearviewOne</a>
    which is as comprehensive in weights and options as any of Spiekermann's. (Designed
    by [[James Montalbano]].)\r\n\r\nThen there's the ubiquitous <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1&totalrecords=13&searchby=&searchID=&searchletter=&searchstr=interstate&font_categories_checkbox=font_name_search&fontRendererText=Yo+quiero+Typophile%21\">Interstate</a>
    from New York designer [[Tobias_Frerejones|Tobias Frere-Jones]]."
