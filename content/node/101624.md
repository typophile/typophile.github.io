    it the same font? If not then this one would also be good to identify.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "@farong Good spot. I think that's been about the closest I've come across.
    It's given me something to start from in looking for similar fonts too. Cantilever
    seems to be a match. Thanks!\r\n\r\n@Ryuk Ah ha! So it is! I didn't realise someone
    asked a similar question so recently. That's good to know, thanks. I think @farong
    was right in it being a customised version of\u2014or at least heavily based on\u2014Neutraface.
    It's a fantastic font.\r\n\r\nFor anyone else looking for similar alternatives:\r\n\r\n-
    Futura\r\n- Relay\r\n- Nobel\r\n- Kabel\r\n\r\nAre all fairly similar geometric
    fonts but not quite as nice as Neutraface in my opinion. In addition, Brandon
    Grotesque is also very nice but a bit softer.\r\n\r\nThanks guys."
