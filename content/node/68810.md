body: Is it going to be awkward if I'll use ligatures as Stylistic Set?

  body: "You mean putting ligature (many-to-one) lookups within a Stylistic Set feature?
    Technically there's nothing wrong with that, and I can think of design conditions
    in which it would be desirable to have specific kinds of ligation happening in
    the context of a Stylistic Set. It does imply, though, that the user won't be
    able to disable ther ligatures when that Stylistic Set is active, which may well
    be your intent. If you do want the user to be able to e.g. turn off the 'liga'
    feature and disable these ligatures while retaining other aspects of the Stylistic
    Set, then you need to perform individual letter substitutions in the Stylistic
    Set features and the ligations subsequent to this in 'liga'. I'd say either approach
    is valid, and depends on what you want the user experience to be, or how rigourously
    you want to control the typographic options when the Stylistic Set is active.\r\n\r\n[As
    a parallel, in my Gabriola font have have some contextual substitution lookups
    directly within the Stylistic Set features and others in the 'calt' feature, depending
    on whether I think the user should be able to turn them off for that style.]"

  body: 'If you don''t use ''liga'' at all, then your ligatures will active whenever
    your Stylistic Set is active, with no way to independently turn them off. And
    that''s fine, if that is what you want. I supppose you might get an occasional
    query from a user wondering why toggling the Ligatures function in InDesign doesn''t
    affect these ligatures, and you can respond ''Because that''s the way I intended
    this Stylistic Set to work: the ligatures are intrinsic to this style.'''
