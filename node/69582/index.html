  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello!

I'm putting together a mess of 19th century fonts from original Library of Congress documents, as well as borders.  The fonts have been coming together great, but the borders are giving me a nightmare problem.

Since I'm an historian first and graphic designer second, I haven't spent all that much time in FontLab prior to starting this, so any help would be immensely appreciated.

Here is my problem:

I've attached an image of whats' going on.  With my current spacing, when typed out in a string on the same line the glyphs (taken from an 1858 broadside) fit snug against each other.  When typed out in Photoshop or Word with a hard return, the type conforms to the leading... so at various point sizes I have  gaps between the top and bottom glyph.  

I don't want that.  I want them snug right against each other on the hard return. I'm about to rip my hair out.  What simple thing to I need to do in FontLab to make things work?

Thank you!
Jason Wickersty</div>

Perhaps both Word and Photoshop don't bother with something as trivial as "the font's preferred leading". Try setting the leading to "100%" -- I don't know where to look for in these programs, but InDesign's default for Auto Leading is "120%" and can be changed in the Justification settings dialog. Or simply set the leading equal to the font size.</div>

The problem is with FontLab, trying to get it to make the two glyph just stay next to each other... Arg!  It's so simple to set the side bearings... why not top and bottom?! :P

There's another font package by WaldenFont which is sort of my inspiration.  They have other border fonts, and when you hard return, the two glyphs snuggle up to each other regardless of how the leading is set.  I want that!</div>

Could you be a little more specific about the font names? I’d like to study that feature you mention.</div>

There are several borders, but the two I've been looking at to try to figure things out were Baubles and Garland in the Wild West package.

Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Since leading is something that is set in applications like Photoshop by the user, you have only limited control over this in the font. The best thing to do is to scale your border elements so that they are correctly spaced when the font is ‘solid set’, i.e. when there is no leading between the lines, e.g. 20pt text size on 20pt leading. This is the only predictable basis on which to work. What this means, in FontLab, is that your border elements should be equal to the UPM height of the font.

For applications that make use of font metrics to define default linespacing, you will want to set the OS/2 Typo and Win metrics values to also sum to the UPM value (treating negative descender values as positive for this calculation).

You can either sit the border elements on the baseline and have all the height above the baseline, or you can give them some descender space. This decision depends on whether and how you want them to align to other fonts.

As an example, presuming your fonts are on a 1000 UPM height. You might scale the border elements to close to that height, and sit them 300 units below the baseline. Then you would set the OS/2 metrics as follows:

TypoAscender = 700
TypoDescender = -300
TypoLinegap = 0
WinAscent = 700
WinDescent = -300

The hhea metrics should match the corresponding OS/2 Typo values.

Of course, then you have to communicate to the user that these fonts should be set solid in programs like Photoshop.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, just licensed the Wild West package. At first sight it doesn’t seem like it works the way you tell: it depends on what the leading is (solid set gives the best results). I tested it in Word 2007 (PC), PhotoshopCS4, and InDesign CS4 (Mac).

I did a borders font a couple of months ago and the best way to go was the same as described by John.

Good luck!</div>
