<p>The graphic design saga of Obama&rsquo;s campaign has been covered extensively.</p>
<p>The Washington Post a week ago or so reported that Obama had reservations about the original O logo, finding it a bit too corporate, but went along with it, deferring to his advisors on this. David Axelrod seems to have commissioned it.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;presidential seal&rsquo; thing was so close to parody that I wonder why they thought it was a good idea. I&rsquo;m curious as to whether the different designers did the original O (great qualities, but a bit too cartoonish, IMHO), the superb &ldquo;Change we can rely on&rdquo; in Gotham, and then this misfire.</p>

<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/obamaseal_narrowweb__300x493,0_3525.jpg]</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> White House contender Barack Obama will no longer be using a campaign seal that critics called an arrogant imitation of the US president&rsquo;s official emblem, according to reports today.</p>
<p>The seal was first seen on Friday at a meeting between Obama and Democratic state governors, causing tongues to wag owing to its close resemblance to the eagle logo displayed on the lectern whenever the president speaks in public.</p>
<p>The Obama seal had the same bald eagle clutching arrows and an olive branch, denoting war and peace, but inserted the words &ldquo;Vero possumus&rdquo; - a loose Latin translation of the Democrat&rsquo;s campaign slogan &ldquo;Yes, we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One Obama aide told Fox News that the widely panned seal was intended as a one-off for Friday&rsquo;s event. But Atlantic.com reported that the candidate himself felt the image had been a &ldquo;silly mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An Obama spokesman could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The seal was greeted with universal derision by US media, and the campaign of Republican candidate John McCain called it &ldquo;laughable, ridiculous, preposterous and revealing all at the same time.&rdquo; <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>This is beautifully executed, but just a terrible idea. I would guess that the same person did this and the original O, as it has a similar feel. It would be interesting to find out the history of this blunder. I wonder if it is a product of collaboration&ndash;someone, or some committee, got the &ldquo;bright idea&rdquo;, and then had the designer execute it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hmmm&hellip;I rather like it. A parody, sure, but why not? To me it&rsquo;s clever, and I like the Obama camp&rsquo;s attention to design and marketing. It&rsquo;s a breath of fresh air in the political picture. But I suppose, if opponents find a way to criticize it in a way that can be distracting and disruptive, it&rsquo;s probably best to pull it off the shelf and move on. I think the critics (opponents) are scrambling for ways to make him look bad. The opponent&rsquo;s marketing flat out sucks by comparison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; are kind of weak campaign themes, I think.  Too ambiguous. But that&rsquo;s beside the point.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah, I thought the seal of &lsquo;now&rsquo; disapproval wrapped up his whole campaign strategy. Add to that, the darn thing is placed crooked.</p>
<p>I also think that those patriotic Dems who were flush with a fresh choice in Obama realise his branding of America - then Lou Dobbs just gained a few more fellow Independent registrants.</p>
<p>On a graphic forum that talks specifically with the POWER of marketing I wrote a piece about how people in times of struggle look for a reason to believe. Obama created a graphic heavy campaign specifically to target those votes (and continues to do so). If Obama doesn&rsquo;t check his ego - and stop subjugating America&rsquo;s patriotic symbols to his own greed/desires - he will surely push Independents over to McCain.</p>

<p>The eagle motif is nothing new to Obama branding. An eagle has been part the main background image of his website since the start: <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/images/bg.jpg">http://www.barackobama.com/images/bg.jpg</a></p>
