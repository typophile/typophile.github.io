  body: "Thanks for the feedback. Boy Wonder Publishing is linked to Bow Wonder Records,
    so i guess it is necessary to have the P in there to differentiate between them,
    although i will try experimenting more with the letter forms, thanks for the pointers.
    Will post back with the results soon . . .\r\n\r\n"

    work recently so I've advised the client that this project be put on hold for
    a couple of weeks. I will be back soon, and will post my results . . thanks again:)\r\n\r\nMy
    thoughts in the meantime however . . .\r\n\r\nlorem ipsum - i tried building the
    letterforms out of more than one triangle, but it jsut seems confusing and the
    shapes loses their rhythm.\r\n\r\nnvhladek - The p is necessary, because there
    is a sister company called Boy Wonder Records, and they need to be differentiated
    between.\r\n\r\nRatbaggy - I have mentioned to the client about using similar
    concepts for both company logos, with small changes to identify, and he seems
    open to the idea. I like the idea of quality that comes with the ribbon shape,
    but not sure if it relates to the company too closely? Ive been experimenting
    with radio waves etc, and as stated will get back with the ideas:)\r\n"

    you try too hard to make a B,W,P as two play buttons I read the glyphs as: play,

    play button concept, I'd like to see more along those lines.  How can you present
    a sturdy, scalable, monochrome play button in a way that's both instantly recognizable,

  body: "I second Paul's sentiment.\r\n\r\nThere are appropriate contexts for a really
    obvious logomark, and a music publisher is not one of them.  So many of the most
    successful marks are non sequitors - a little girl with an umbrella for salt,
    a peacock for a TV news station, a shell for a gas station, a ribbon for flour,
    an apple for computers, the list goes on and on and on.\r\n\r\nWhen the name is
    not obvious and/or the concept is hard to grasp, then some kind of explanatory
    or illustrative logomark is definitely called for, but a music publisher is hardly
    a difficult concept.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"
