  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve recently noticed working in Illustrator that when using a text block from a font that contains components that overlap, eg. Ccedilla … sometimes when zooming in and out briefly you can see that the overlap space between shapes flash&rsquo;s white, basically &lsquo;inverting&rsquo; the overlap shape.</p>
<p>Is this just an occurence with overlapping components in Illustrator? Is there a step in the process to merge a component and glyph before or during export?</p>

<p>I also wanted to know that why does sometimes it shows those white overlaps (specially in OTF outputs), even if the curves direction is correct? Anyone?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah I&rsquo;m curious if it&rsquo;s best to decompose all components and merge contours… I assume thats the step to avoid any strange overlaps, they&rsquo;ve only shown up for myself when zooming or panning, just a detail I picked up on while working with a textfield that had component characters in it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, it is best to merge contours if there are overlaps. Historically, some RIPs had a problem interpreting overlaps, and reversed-out the overlapped area. This may not be an issue any longer, but a more common problem is that users may want to apply outline effects to type, and if there is an overlap in e.g. Ccedilla then the overlap will be exposed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John: &ldquo;Historically, some RIPs had a problem interpreting overlap&hellip;&rdquo;
This is true or contours that overlap within a glyph.<br>
But I thought composites are rendered as separate contours, and with the ensuing bitmaps merged, there should be no problem?</p>
<p>Mike: &ldquo;&hellip;sometimes when zooming in and out briefly you can see that the overlap space between shapes flash’s white&hellip;&rdquo;
I have seen zooming do that described here, almost like there is still some little gremlin of old PS code that is relied on at certain combinations of resolution and zoom.</p>
<p>John: &ldquo;&hellip;users may want to apply outline effects to type, and if there is an overlap in e.g. Ccedilla then the overlap will be exposed.&rdquo;
&hellip;in many applications. There are some apps, like InDesign for example, which not only respect the TT flag indicating overlaps (&amp; removing them automatically when outline effects are specified), but go beyond and manage the final rendering of all outlined type intelligently, as illustrated below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/IndesignOutlines_5832.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Ç and ø are overlapping composites in this example, and as the intelligent application must do the &ldquo;right thing&rdquo; to the &ldquo;ca&rdquo; tracking that goes on as the example continues&hellip; I mean, what do other apps do?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
