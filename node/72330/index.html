So what changes now is that it is enable by default, which hardly makes any practical difference for many distributions.</div>

<p>On the subject of Linux font rendering, one thing that surprised me is the very great difference in text rendering quality between different browsers. Firefox rendering in Linux is very poor compared to Opera. [These comments based on admittedly limited experience looking at my wife&rsquo;s Ubuntu install.] I wonder if that will change now, or if it is something independent of FreeType.</p>

<p>Presumably that one has a commercial rasteriser implementation that one is seeking to license to customers for money, and then these pesky open source folk come along with a free rasteriser. Now, presuming that one has paid a license fee to Apple to implement their patents in your commercial rasteriser &ndash; whether one needed to or not &ndash;, one might see it as unfair competition for another rasteriser not to have paid Apple to license those patents.</p>
<p>According to the allegation to which Si linked, Sampo and Bitstream are the ‘scary patent-mongering user-haters’. I suppose Sampo knows as much as anyone about TT patents, since he wrote them. Apple, for their part, have apparently been happily collecting patent license fees from anyone offering to pay them, even as they appear to have taken no legal action against those who didn&rsquo;t. All very messy.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean the meaningless meaning of competition that&rsquo;s generally used around MS products. Are one of you going to boldly suggest that any substantial number of users choose among platforms by rasterizer, even when each platform has several?</p>
<p>The fact is that Linux users had their font supply and font quality cut by unfounded developer fears. That&rsquo;s all, and it&rsquo;s hardly fantastic.</p>

<p>Exactly. End users are not the customers for rasterisers: they&rsquo;re the downstream consumers. When Si spoke about competing rasteriser makers, he obviously meant companies competing for actual customers, i.e. makers of rasteriser client devices and software.</p>

<p>With many free software licenses, you can&rsquo;t technically license patents, because you can&rsquo;t pass the protection you perceive with your code, see §11 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->patents<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html|GPL]] for example. Also, there are the stand against software patents that many free software developers would take, so it is on principle to avoid software patents, neither licensing them nor intentionally violating them.</p>

<p>Thanks for the decrypt. But &ldquo;obviously&rdquo;&hellip; Quartz and ClearType, (the rasterizers) are not for licensing as far as I know. We are obviously talking here about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->scaler,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for which these ex-patents were made and obviously not rasterization. Is that not obvious?</p>

<p>As far as I know too, but FontFusion is for licensing, and Monotype&rsquo;s UFST is for licensing, and they&rsquo;re in direct competition with FreeType for the embedded market.</p>
<p>Does anyone other than you use the term rasteriser in such a precise way that it is distinct from scaler? Apple seem to use the terms interchangeably, as do other people who show up in Google searches for ‘font scaler’.</p>
<p>Since the business of licensing technologies for font rendering tends to involve whole solutions for embedded systems, distinguishing bits and pieces of those renderers seems irrelevant to the discussion about who would or would not have had a vested interest in persuading FreeType that it would need to license patents from Apple.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think Khaled has nailed it. The issue for FreeType was most likely inclusion of patented IP in open source software, irrespective of whether Apple intended to enforce patent licensing.</p>

<p>I know you don&rsquo;t like hints, but I&rsquo;m only tying to help. Them patented instructions, in post-aliased screen font environments, were not part of the solution of hints that worked&hellip; I said so long ago and since. I came back to cover your fantasies of my fantasies in this otherwise gentle conversation.</p>
<p>Anytime anyone wants to talk about all of raterization, (sizing, scaling and rasterizing) and use the term rasterizer, that&rsquo;s fine. Anytime anyone wants to talk &lsquo;bout one of them and use the term rasterizer, that&rsquo;s for less expert forums, I think. The patents, I think were for code that does scaling useful in aliased rasterization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the business of licensing technologies for font rendering tends to involve whole solutions for embedded systems,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had not noticed this tendency from the Apple-MS TT license onward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t say you meant anything by competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm? I mean(t) that in the post-aliased world of screen fonts, FT solutions could bring competition to the Quartz and ClearType scaler and rasterizer solutions and bring true competition to many parts of the market vertically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What Si meant is obvious: a different product competing for the same market of customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That, to me, is not obvious&hellip; Or are we so different, my brother, (the same market of customers), that we should be so devoted to totally different scalers and rasterizers? ;)</p>
<p>Or would you suggest that the market of font software implementers gives their customers a choice? Or would you suggest that the choice these implementers have is wide enough to justify use of the terms like choice and competition?</p>
<p>It all, choice and competition, depend(ed) on developers getting amp-ed about hints that work if they need them, for the market transitioning from A to AA fonts. I see one &lsquo;r two companies that&rsquo;ve been in the hinting business constantly since the mid-1990&rsquo;s. This miscreation of a fantasy problem with TT patents is one reason.</p>
<p>And should I ask sii&hellip; who jumped off the hinting bandwagon recently? Head &lsquo;em up, move em out all day long here to ensure windows users don&rsquo;t barf at their type. Must be for the sake of competition, eh!?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
