body: Anyone have any good/useful style sheet naming/creation/hierarchy techniques?
  I&#39;m having trouble settling... I do it differently for every publication I work
  with. Is there a One True Way to do stylesheets?

    body, sidebar, and caption.  <BR>Then character stylesheets for each of these
    that require <BR>them &#40;body-bold, body-cite, head-smallcaps, etc.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>This is very generalized and simplified, of course, but <BR>that&#39;s the
    main structure. I find it works well and helps <BR>push through the ultimately
    time-saving, but initially <BR>irritating practice of creating the sheets.'

  body: 'One trick we use at work, where multiple designers work  on multiple publications:
    put an identifying code at the beginning of all the style sheets that belong to
    a particular publication, e.g., AA Body Text, AA Head, etc. That way, when text
    inevitably gets copied from another pub and brings the style sheet along for the
    ride, it&#39;s easy to weed out the intruder. We use the same naming convention
    for colors, too &#40;AA 100c20m&#41;. Keeps our palettes pure.'
