  came a pdf specimen from <a href=\"http://www.australianfaces.com/\">Australian

  looks surprisingly like the wonderful Mantinia from <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/\">The
  Font Bureau</a>, with a badly modified B and G. Ugh. Perhaps it is accidental, a
  freak of nature where the Aussies have managed to design a frighteningly similar

  body: Probably not legit, especially when you take into account the other copies
    at that site. Deftone is a <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/deftone/">Larabie</a>
    font. UntitledAF is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=solaris">Solaris</a>.
    Old Chicago is just the old Mac system font run through a filter.
