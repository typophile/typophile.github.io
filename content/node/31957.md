  frustrating behavior.\r\n\r\nAfter importing all of my glyphs, I've created metrics
  classes and assigned metrics to my font. I then begin creating classes for kerning
  and, a few minutes into the process, will flip back to my metrics classes to find
  them all suddenly gone.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, thank god, the metrics are still
  there for each character, so the work isn't 100% lost, but the class-based organization
  of all that work appears to be gone.\r\n\r\nThis is just one of many, many frustrations
  I have with this program, and while it's functionality in the basic sense is impressive,
  the interface and general finesse of the program is mind-bogglingly incomplete and
  unstable. That, combined with the fact that it doesn't appear to come with any help
  or documentation whatsoever aside from a superficial, semi-incomplete and poorly
  written manual, is really making me wonder if the price tag is totally justified.\r\n\r\nPhew.
  Just had to vent about that a little.\r\n\r\nBut back to the issue at hand, has
  anyone else have this problem? I admit I could just be doing something wrong or
  missing something obvious, but the shoddy documentation isn't helping me zero in
  on the cause.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    classes\" problem.\r\nI think it happened to me specially whe I selected the pull
    menu to see only kerning or metric classes. When I tried to switch back again
    to the other classes, they were gone.\r\n\r\nNow I keep all the classes visible
    and of course I save them everytime I do something new."
