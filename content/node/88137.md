  body: "Akzidenz Grotesk & AG Book = closest free option is probably Arial or Helvetica
    (free as in likely pre-installed on your computer)\r\n\r\nMinion Pro = if you
    have a Mac, perhaps Palatino would suffice (again, pre-installed). Also note that,
    I think--at least at one time--Minion was installed for you if you purchased an
    Adobe product such as Illustrator or Photoshop. \r\n\r\nGalliard = I'm not much
    help there. Maybe Georgia is close enough to the ballpark for you. But that's
    probably a long shot. \r\n\r\n"

    it comes to Akzidenz Grotesk, go for a geometric sans. Helvetica, Arial if you
    have, if not get one of their sisters:\r\n\r\nTex Gyre Heros: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/TeX-Gyre-Heros\r\nor
    Nimbus Sans, which is part of the URW font package: http://www.artifex.com/downloads/\r\n\r\nAnother
    geometric sans is:\r\nEau: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Eau"
