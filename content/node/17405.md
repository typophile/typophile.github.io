body: "I'm working with a number of editors who are using Microsoft Word to write
  their articles. Because they're not particularly savvy, these editors use the \"[[faux
  formating|faux]]\" bold and italic buttons regularly, instead of changing the typeface
  to the correct italic or bold variant. Regardless of your opinion on this poor practice,
  it hasn't proved a problem because InDesign had the smarts to convert faux italics
  into real italics when the Word docs are imported, making the necessary substitutions
  automatically.  Or so I thought.\r\n\r\nWe've just changed our primary text typeface
  and InDesign now ignores the \"faux\" formatting on import. The text appears a straight
  roman with no bold or italic. I can only imagine that this is an issue with the
  new font we are using because this is the only variable that has changed -- that
  perhaps the designer missed a step when generating the font files or that there's
  a requisite box defining a particular weight as the default bold? I'm talking about
  in Fontographer or FontLab. Both the old font and the new font are Type 1, so it's
  not an OpenType thing.\r\n\r\nI'd like to go back to the type designer armed with
  some suggestion for a fix. (Because I'm making the assumption that the fix needs
  to be made to the font.) The client has already signed off on the typeface, so simply
  changing the font isn't an option, and there are enough italics and bolds set that
  I'd rather not go back and change them all by hand. Can you help?"

  body: You shouldn't feel as if you have to have explanations for the type designer.
    I wouldn't. I would guess it is a naming issue. But, really, the type designer
    should be able to explain it to you. No?

  body: It sounds like the font is not set up with reg/bold/italic/bold italic linkings.
    I believe this is the only way that InDesign would know which font to use for
    bold or italic when it imports the Word doc. It has been common practice for some
    foundries to set up each font in a family as its own separate one-font family
    in order to overcome Windows/Mac name compatibility issues. Perhaps this is the
    case with the new fonts?

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions. I've spoken with the designer and indeed, the
    font was not set up with the linkings. It's a new still-in-development face, so
    that simply hadn't been done yet.\r\n\r\n(Thanks also for moving this topic --
    I wasn't sure whether it belonged in Build as it was more an end-user question
    -- I figured someone would move it if necessary.)"

  body: 'It''s not a problem on the Mac either, if the fonts are set up correctly.
    I don''t think it ever has been a problem, except with fonts that don''t have
    style links or have incomplete links (italics, but no bold, for example). The
    style linking information is stored in the FOND resource (in the font "suitcase")
    in both Type 1 and TrueType fonts. '

    to support style links, and the bold and italic fonts are present. Calling the
    initial use of this faux bold and italic is incorrect - faux bold and italic is
    what happens when the fonts are either not present or not linked. Simply using
    the buttons is just fine as long as the fonts are linked and present (and even
    necessary if the person is using Word on Windows, or if the files might be taken
    to the Windows version of Word).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello to all,\r\n\r\nThanks for the illuminating discussion...I was just
    having this exact problem and found this thread.\r\n\r\nI have designed identities
    for some small companies and created templates for them in Word that have this
    exact problem: the fonts in use don't have correct FOND resource style linking
    information to allow autosubstitution in Word (thanks for the tip Mark...)\r\n\r\nFor
    example, I used Scala and Scala Sans in an identity just a few months ago and
    had to resort to creating paragraph styles in the Normal.dot templates (along
    with simple keyboard shortcuts and a training session with the employees on how
    to use them!):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Scala_fauxformatting_6077.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo,
    the question is: when using commercial typefaces in projects, how can designers
    correct this? Can font programmers be hired to \"correct\" the lack of style linking
    information in these fonts and save new versions of the font files? Or, would
    that be breaking the legal terms of use?.....\r\n\r\nWhy would reputable foundries
    not include this information in their faces' FOND resource areas?!?\r\n\r\nIt
    really is a problem when the end user is the average corporate worker. They simply
    won't bother with complex formatting rules, no matter how simple you try to make
    it for them....if the bold and italic buttons don't work in Word, forget it. I
    said the words \"Paragraph Style\" to them in the above-mentioned training session,
    and they looked at me like I had a 10-pound goiter.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for
    dealing with this in the future?\r\n(and thanks Tom for the macro code.....very
    handy, but again, I leave little hope that end users of office templates will
    actually ever run it!....)"
