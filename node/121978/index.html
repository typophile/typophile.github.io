(I can’t find an oblique version)

Looking at past threads (http://typophile.com/node/67020 http://typophile.com/node/42149 http://typophile.com/node/73447 http://www.typophile.com/node/106599) it seems that one still can acquire it in metal and there are at least two commercial releases:  
http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/celebrity/parisian-ornamentals/
http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/fleurons-initials/ (this one is a less textured version)
The fact that they’re commercial doesn’t automatically guarantee a better quality.

With the recent popularity of chromatic fonts and the efforts to fill the gaps in the Dan X. Solo’s collections, there could be some new offering somewhere too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Too many points is the problem with making any of these elaborate ornamented fonts.
About half a decade ago I took a stab at making a well engineered version of Lettres Ornées with the minimum number of points. I got as far as doing part of the letter _E_
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LettresOrnées1_6253.jpg] [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LettresOrnées3_6382.jpg]
At the rate I was going it would have taken an incredible amount of time to do the full alphabet!
So I threw in the towel. A project for somebody with lots of time on their hands!
Which probably explains why we are stuck with mega-point digital versions that sometimes seize up during viewing and fail in printing.

		<div class="commentbody">That's interesting. I can see why there hasn't been a better version of these ornate fonts available yet.
I guess these type of fonts would be best to be done as layered typefaces? These would probably split the type into several fonts but the point would probably be a lot lower in this case?

I am not a typeface designer so I am not sure all the technical details but it seems layered fonts are popular nowadays?....</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This version of Madame is well made but I find it awkward to use.
It seems to have been designed for the era when printers had severe memory limitations.
Out of curiosity I assembled the parts into complete letters about a decade ago and tested them on a basic laser printer. Worked fine.
BTW, Madame has far fewer points than any of the ornamented fonts mentioned in this thread.
