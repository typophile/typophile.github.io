body: "Hey, this is a new logo mock-up for a small creative firm, specializing mostly
  in interactive design. The old look we felt was a little to dark and edgy and decided
  to lighten it up a bit. The new look is just a text mark in Bauer Bodini pt72. We
  feel we needed something a bit friendlier to relate with our current stream of clients(doctors,
  lawyers, etc...). We think the new look is a bit more timeless and wouldn't have
  to be drastically changed in the future, maybe just retouched. Feel free to make
  any comments or suggestions on the logo including if it should be accompanied by
  a mark or not?? Thanks for any posts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fourfather_4967.png]"

    to the interesting name, the word looks good, it looks trustworthy and arty. My
    only question is, is it too similar to <a href = \"http://www.pentagram.com/ \">
    Pentagram's </a> to create enough of a point of difference? Maybe a mark would
    help\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n--N"

  body: Hey, we get asked that all of the time so I'm pretty good at answering the
    question. We named the firm Fourfather obviously because phonetically its "forefather".
    The meaning of forefather has to do with being a part of a tradition from its
    origin. We feel we've collectively been in the business long enough to make that
    bold of a statement. The Four replaced Fore because there are 4 of us who started
    the firm. Plus we do operate mainly on a digital medium and the number in some
    slight way validates that. Would love to hear more comments on the name/logo/color,
    anything you guys have to offer would be great. Oh and Nick, thanks for the post.
    I am very familiar with Pentagram and it does come to mind when looking at the
    word. I think maybe a color change would help improve, but we do love the color.

    you could expect them here. It also connects to lawyers etc.\r\nHowever, a bit
    more creativity would be appreciated. Even by you customers.\r\n\r\nTo me 'Fourfathers'
    would be more in balance if it would be written in lower cast: fourfathers\r\n\r\nOr
    play with upper and lower cast together to get a playful thing. Although, that

  body: Why stick to one colour? We often design logos to appear in a different colours
    on different applications (but best to choose a complementary palette of colours,
    obviously). You could have some fun with it rather than worrying that you've chosen
    the just the right colour.

  body: "Perhaps \"four\" and \"father\" are different colors, or the same color but
    at differing percentages. Or, maybe you set \"father\" in a more modern typeface,
    a sans that marries well with the Bodoni. This may reinforce your \"fore\" idea.
    That is, in an old/new kind of way.\r\n\r\n "

  body: "i would definitely try and rethink your approach. it is more than commendable
    that you have gone for a simple and timeless solution, but it does bear an uncanny
    resemblance to a lot of industry, hm... forefathers, like interbrand, landor,
    and, of course Pentagram. \r\n\r\nif it is your aim to rank yourselves amongst
    the aforementioned, then i am sure there are many different ways to articulate
    your potential than Bauer Bodoni 72. as a matter of fact pentagram's identity
    probaby works because its simplicity contrasts with the amount and diversity of
    work they have produced, rather than some sort of painstaking perfectionism in
    their choice of Modern 20.\r\n\r\ni would just make a fantastic showcase of your
    work rather than spend any more time on kerning (with all due respect)."

    you make about the broad spectrum of work some of the larger firms have on display
    to contrast with the simple branding. I''m starting to think that for our demographic
    and location it could actually backfire. I''ve had several people tell me they
    liked the old one in comparison because the new one is "too plain". '

  body: "One thing i like about a plain logo is that depending on it's context it
    could work very well. Maybe we need to split up the debate to:\r\n\r\n1. Is the
    logo imposing on another designer/studio?\r\nPersonally i think the logo is very
    similar, but it does not copy anything unique because of its simplicity.\r\n\r\n2:
    What is the purpose of your logo for your company?\r\nDoes your logo define your
    company, what is the definition? Is your brand's main goal to help new client
    acquisition? Where should your logo take you?\r\n\r\n3. Does/Can the logo work
    well for its purpose? \r\nI think developing a consistent and unique brand strategy
    that includes everything you would use in your designs besides your logo can turn
    a plain logo into an interesting brand image that sets you apart from the competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
