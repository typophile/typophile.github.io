  to introduce myself, but I have been following some of the forum topics with great
  interest. I am amazed everytime a forum member comments on a typeface for critique
  as I will see something that I would not have noticed before, and this proves that
  there is so much for me to learn here.\r\n\r\nI am keen on typography, and my recent
  purchase of Robofont (without any prior knowledge of font softwares, neither experience
  in typeface design, so this is a first) allowed me to draw some shapes to be played
  around with as a font. I have no idea on how to use the software to its greatest
  effect, but I would like to start somewhere in learning how to design proper typefaces.\r\n\r\nI
  thought the best way to learn was to dive straight in and put it up for critique,
  and to see if there is any way to eventually develop this to be used somewhere as
  a display face? Also would be good to know if there is already an existing font
  like this that I am not aware of.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago, I started drawing these
  shapes in Illustrator based on a simple grid, and imposed some restrictions with
  regards to the angles for the different parts of the characters. The thicker ones
  were an initial attempt, and I recently re-drew a new set with a higher contrast
  between the vertical strokes and the horizontal and diagonal ones, and some changes
  were done to the structure for some characters.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the character
  widths are kept the same, and I think this has caused problems with the new set's
  kerning (don't know how to set that in Robofont either) so this is still monospaced
  for now? I hope to eventually learn how to kern character pairs to remove the awkward
  spaces between some alphabets.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate your feedback and
  comments and how I can improve it to be decent enough for use! Thanks in advance
  :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_6190.png]"

    static designs are always rather bulky friend for the reading eye. Nonetheless,
    enjoy playing around with it.\r\n\r\nWhen you want to dig deeper into the craft
    one day, turn to writing by hand. It will teach you everything (apart from handling
    the application, of course)."

  body: "Hi Sean. Welcome to typophile!\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, this is more than a
    'nice exercise'. This has serious potential. Something I rarely see with newcomers
    typophile, so you must be talented. I absolutely hate All monospaced font, except
    yours. I don't know how you've done it, but you did a great job.\r\n\r\nNow, enough
    for the praising part. First of all, ask yourself this. Do you want a monospaced
    font, or a font that LOOKS like a monospaced font. The latter would involve optical
    adjustments in width and spacing, which will make it look more 'monospaced', but,
    when a line is typed underneath a previous line, they won't align.\r\n\r\nAn actual
    monospaced font has it's charms, and is closest to what you've already made, so
    I'd go for it.\r\n\r\nI like your idea to make a high-contrast version as well,
    but it inevitably causes an uneven 'colour'. I'd stick with it though, because
    it's something I haven't seen before. Originality is always good, bodoni doesn't
    have an even colour either :-)\r\n\r\nHigh-contrast feedback:\r\n\r\n[1] First
    of all, I think your high-contrast version would look better if you'd stick to
    the shapes of the low-contrast version. (Q U J P B)\r\n\r\n[2] For /C E F L S/
    are all too light. I suggest to attach a small square serif-like thing to the
    top and bottom horizontal bar, too add some colour. It's not THE  answer, but
    it's worth trying IMO.\r\n\r\n[3] For /Z/, also too light, I suggest a more daring
    solution. Just forget about the grid and give the diagonal the same OPTICAL thickness
    as the stem (vertical part) of I. Also remove the short vertical bits, first.
    Another solution for /Z/ would be to go with [2].\r\n\r\n[4] To make this into
    a functional family, you want the low-contrast and the hihg-contrast version to
    look like they belong together. Although the /O/ in low-contrast, technically
    doesn't have a horizontal bit in it, it does appear to have a horizontal bit.
    Thus, the high-contrast /O/ should have a horizontal bit as well. This means that
    the diagonals in high-contrast /O/ will be shorter. Thus, the diagonals in /A
    C Q U E F J P R D S G B/ should be shorter as well. \r\n\r\nWork step by step.
    Doing all this at once will give you headaches. Don't blindly do as I say, but
    at least give it a try. Always save backups of old versions. Good luck.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper
    de Waard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks guys, for the warm welcome :)\r\n\r\n@Andreas\r\nThanks for the suggestion.
    I definitely want to dig deeper (getting more exciting the deeper I go) and eventually
    try drawing a typeface that is friendly to the reading eye :)\r\n\r\n@Jasper\r\nThank
    you for the kind words. It is very encouraging to hear.\r\n\r\nI started drawing
    them monospaced, but saw the flaws very obviously in the strong-contrast version,
    so am not sure if I still want it monospaced or to develop it in that looks-like-monospaced
    direction.\r\n\r\nI will try out the suggestions you made regarding the serifs
    and structures of the alphabets you pointed out. It will be interesting if they
    eventually can be a family, but I guess I will have to get the basic character
    structures right first! Looks like a lot of re-structuring based on your suggestions,
    but I really appreciate it :)\r\n\r\n@hrant\r\nWhen you mentioned how they might
    intermix / focus on layering, did you mean those fonts where there are multiple
    layers that can work on top of each other to create one font, and still work individually?
    I imagine that to be very challenging, but I would like to give it a try once
    I have got the basics ironed out. Thanks :)\r\n\r\nHope to find time to re-look
    into this, and post updates soon."

  body: "Those are nice starts, but with capitals you quickly run into the system.
    It's a good training ground, so go slow, try different contrast systems, try to
    look into lower case. Try to find the contrasts which will turn from display to
    legible, how thick can you make the high contrast and how thin? Try to enlarge
    the grid and have a look what kind of shapes you can make.\r\n\r\nIn all, when
    learning, try to have fun first, and only focus on the more theoretical parts
    later. I must say that handwriting route isn't bad, but this serves just as well.\r\n\r\nSo
    keep on going!"

    before, looking forward to your comments and suggestions, particularly \u2018T\u2019,
    and the little serif-y strokes on \u2018i\u2019, \u2018j\u2019, \u2018l\u2019?
    I think the main challenge was in trying to balance the space around each letter
    caused by the rigid grid, but not sure if that created inconsistencies across
    the entire set.\r\n\r\n@Jasper I introduced a thick diagonal as suggested, along
    with the little serifs. Is there an identity crisis happening? :D And due to the
    introduction of the lowercase, I guess mono-spaced is not ideal for now?\r\n\r\n@hrant
    I have not ventured onto the layering approach yet. Going slow, but hope to get
    there :)\r\n\r\n@Arthus Thank you. Yes, with this update, I explored the lowercase,
    and sort of \u201Cbroke\u201D the grid in a lot of places. Hope this is an improvement!\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\nSean"

    e, z, looks uncertain. Either do something daring with it, or get rid of it. The
    terminals on letters s, c, r, k, x are much more attractive, so I'd keep those.\r\n-
    I think it would make more sense to make the left part of e and c like the left
    of d.\r\n- I would like to see the right bottom part of g and y, similar to the
    right bottom of j.\r\n- x is too wide\r\n- J and L are too wide.\r\n- Spacing/kerning
    is too tight.\r\n- The dot on the i and j is quite close to the stem now. Perhaps
    make it a bit flatter, to create a bit more white.\r\n\r\nKeep it up! Cheers,
