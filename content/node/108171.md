  body: "Good find Ryuk. This one stumped me.\r\nNik Thoenen's explanation of how
    he made the font is fascinating. Using a font editor's blend feature to combine
    an angular and rounded font, and going a step further by chopping it up into segments
    that can be edited into modules for creation of new fonts. Learn something new
    every day.\r\nDon"
