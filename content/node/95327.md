  \ /> \r\n\r\nIt seems to actually be two fonts (one for the top text and one for
  the bottom).  I have downloaded a Vector Stock image from http://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/vintage-card-vector-826177
  and I really liked the way this font looked together with that image.  Unfortunatly
  the text is not editable and does not have any info about the font used.\r\n\r\nIf
  the exact font cannot be identified, suggestions would be helpful.  I am looking
  for something to go along with that image.  I plan on using the floral type design
  from the link to make a gift label for guests at a wedding."
