body: "This is for the recently canned, the belatedly laid off, the retired, the dismissed,
  those tired of taking orders, those baffled by human behavior and anyone who wonders
  what to do when.  I put my 30 years of experience into the book I needed when I
  started freelancing, but those who need it most might miss it. Originally titled
  \"The Freelance Survival Guide\" (the publisher renamed it to appeal to a broader
  market and fit into their \"Start & Run\" series) it's filled with information,
  encouragement and guidance for the free-fall of self-employment.  \"Start and Run
  a Creative Services Business\" is the new title--nothing I would've picked up when
  I was in school.  \r\n\r\nOf course, my favorite chapter is Nine Sure Signs You're
  Not Getting Paid,but of broader interest is the chapter filled with sage advice
  about professional practices, information on the creative process in general and
  current issues surrounding theft of creative product.  \r\nHere is the table of
  contents for your review, and excerpts are accessible on my homepage by clicking
  on the book icon:\r\n\r\n>> Getting Started \r\n>> Creating Your Work Environment\r\n>>
  Take a Personal & Portfolio Inventory\r\n>> Keeping Your Clients\r\n>> Identifying
  & Targeting Your Market On-line\r\n>> Partnering Alliances\r\n>> New Business Cold
  Calling Tips\r\n>> Negotiating with Vendors\r\n>> Nine Sure Signs You're Not Getting
  Paid\r\n>> Fees and What to do When Clients Don't Do the right thing\r\n>> Scoundrels
  & Scalawags, Piranhas & Barracudas\r\n>> Life Rafts for the Drowning\r\n>> Sage
  Advice from a Veteran\r\n>> Online Resources you can use\r\n\r\nI'm afraid with
  the new title it will be missed by the people who can use it\r\nmost--so I'm out
  here beating the bushes hoping to get the word out.  If you've read this far, you
  deserve a free cartoon at my site called Melon at the Plaza. Click on complimentary
  cartoon or the book icon.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n"
