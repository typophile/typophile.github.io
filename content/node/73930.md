  body: "first of all thanks for appreciating my business card :)\r\n\r\nsecond, well
    it's not about me but about my friend's Spectra, which I am a huge fan of and
    one of very few users, since Kamil is stubborn enough to stop the rest of the
    world from enjoying the use of Spectra font. Maybe this little word of appreciation
    will help him \"finish\" the font, because he keeps believing that Spectra hasn't
    become perfect yet and requires a whole lot of work.\r\n\r\nanyways, if anyone
    feels like telling Kamil about how cool Spectra is here's his email address kukam
    at o2.pl\r\n\r\nKasia\r\n\r\n"

    is your child so who can blame you for wanting perfection! But, perhaps your child
    needs to be born before it can grow into its perfection?\r\n\r\nChrisL"
