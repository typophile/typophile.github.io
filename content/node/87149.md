  want to know more; ex: in this text about Lucas de Groot Corpid: \"Corpid is now
  very international and very versatile: we designed a broad range of numeral styles
  and international character sets, including Greek and Cyrillic, and even a <em>phonetic
  set for use in dictionaries and textbooks</em>\".\r\n\r\nWhat is a phonetic set
  of a typeface? Is a special form of typeface for <em>use in dictionaries and textbooks</em>?"
