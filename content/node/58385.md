  combination I suggested on Friday (Graublau Sans Web with Lucida sanserif), and
  my typeset example?\r\n\r\nBlog post:\r\nhttp://nicewebtype.com/notes/2009/05/22/nice-web-type-likes/\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nhttp://nicewebtype.com/fonts/graublau-sans-web/\r\n\r\nIf
  we want web typography to be respected as a part of our art and craft, web typesetting
  deserves our fullest criticism \u2013 judging the work on aesthetic merits while
  accounting for available technologies.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"

  body: If you're not sure where to start, consider (from the text in the example
    page itself) any of my claims about the two faces. Do you agree? Do you disagree?
    <strong>Why?</strong> Also, please criticize the typesetting of the example itself.
