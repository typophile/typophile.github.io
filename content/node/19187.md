  have any suggestions for beautiful upper/lower fonts, I'd love to hear those too.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/everbloom.jpg]

  body: "That may not be a \"unicase\" font but rather could be a logo basedon an
    existing font. \r\nYou can find other unicase fonts here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=unicase\r\n\r\nYour
    font reminds me of Chalet Paris 1960 at House Industries but for the tail on the
    R and the m. Also shades of Avant Garde."

  body: "It's likely they used <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=kravitz&page=1&nb_ppp_old=50&text=everbloom&nb_ppp=50&classt=alpha\">Kravitz
    Thermal</a> by Ben Belvanz which I'll bet is based on some custom lettering from
    a Kravtiz album.\r\n\r\nThe font isn't one of Ben's better attempts. That m is
    a mess. An alternative is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=4&displayfontid=C.106298.0.0&fontRendererText=everbloom\">Futura
    Maxi</a> whose super high x-height should make the unicasing an easier task."
